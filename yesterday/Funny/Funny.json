    "description": "One person stopped a park from being used by local kids, and the way they went about it has everyone in the community upset about it. This story was shared to r/mildyinfuriating, but it's actually extremely infuriating, according to numerous commenters on the post! A person or persons got this playground shut down, and it seems like it might take a long while to reopen it. If you live near a park, you might overhear kids laughing and playing, or maybe there's a constant stream of people walking by your home. I understand that this could be annoying to residents, but kids need to play somewhere! If you don't like people approaching your property, perhaps you can invest in a few signs, maybe some security cameras, or even adopt a big dog to start barking whenever someone walks by. There are probably like 100 things you should do before ever doing what this person did to the park. Although the post states that the security cameras were down at the actual park location, maybe there are homes or businesses nearby whose cameras did catch this villain. This shouldn't go unpunished! The families who used this park deserve a just end to this whole saga. Check out the full story, plus a few of the startling photos, down below. Then, check out some oddly designed items that are made for people with interesting taste, like one person who lamented, \"Can't decide if I love them or hate them.\"",

    "description": "Parallel parking can spark the kind of anxiety that one wants to avoid at all costs. Sometimes, it's inevitable, and if you live in a densely populated city like New York, you probably are intimately aware of that inevitability. That being said, if most drivers could conceivably avoid having to parallel park, they will, and who wouldn't? It's beneficial for the health and safety of all, and in many cases, it could take just as much time to find a regular parking space as it could to go through the potentially arduous parallel parking process. As a New Yorker, parallel parking was a required part of the roast test. I remember anxiously dreading that part of the road test, which was almost always left for last. Despite practicing perfectly countless times beforehand, my parallel parking job on the big day left much to be desired. In short, it was definitely not close enough to the curb, and I wish I could have had a do-over, yet somehow, I still passed. The truth of the matter is that I've rarely had to parallel park since… like most folks, I avoid it at all costs.",

    "description": "Okay, so we know, as much as we love trashcan kitties, that there are some people out there who have the money and want to invest it in buying a \"fancy\" cat. We know it. And although we 100% believe that people should adopt cats and not shop for them, we do, on some level, kind of get it. Because we love rare cats too. We love Norwegian forest cats and all their floof. We love hairless sphynx cats in all of their uncooked-chicken-looking glory. And of course, we love the majestic Maine Coon cats. If we ever happened to be adopted by one of those breeds, or any other, we would be thankful for the honor bestowed upon us by the Cat Distribution System, and we would make sure to pamper these cats the way that they deserve to be pampered. Would we buy a cat like that? Most likely not. We would look to adopt one. Would we buy a cat like that for $4000? No. Would we return the beautiful cat that we bought for $4000 dollars because it turned out to be deaf? No chance in friggin' hell.",

If not, you should probably get on that—right after reading this.Today's featured post revolves around the concept of a roast—a playful tradition of good-naturedly poking fun at someone (or something). In this case, the subject of the roast is none other than the original poster's strikingly silly-looking orange cat. And when we say \"strikingly silly-looking,\" we truly mean it. This little guy appears as if he's been through the washer and dryer, only to be hit by a bolt of lightning immediately afterward. His hilariously expressive face and delightfully disheveled stature come together in perfect harmony, making for an absolutely ridiculous and lovable appearance.Embracing the spirit of fun, his cat parent invited the feline-loving corner of the internet to join in on the roast, and the commenters did not disappoint. They delivered some of the wittiest, most playful burns imaginable—proving once again that the internet takes no prisoners when it comes to a good roast.",

    "description": "The CEO of Delia's company retired. They were an old hand in the industry, the kind of person who worked their way up and had an engineering background, and while the staff loved them, the shareholders were less than pleased, because the company was profitable, but not obscenely so. So the next CEO was a McKinsey-approved MBA who had one mission: cut costs. Out went the senior devs, and much of the managers. Anyone who was product or customer focused followed quickly behind. What remained were a few managers handpicked by the new CEO and a slew of junior engineers- and Pierre. Pierre was a contractor who followed the new CEO around from company to company. Pierre was there to ensure that nobody wasted any time on engineering that didn't directly impact features. Tests? Wastes of time. Module boundaries? Just slow you down. Move fast and break things, and don't worry about fixing anything because that's your successors' problem. So let's take a look at how Pierre wrote code. This block of PHP code was simply copy/pasted everywhere it needed to be used, across multiple applications. foreach($alphaCheck as $checkField) { if($paramsArray[$checkField['field']]) { if($paramsArray[$checkField['field']]) { $invalidChars = false; $checkValue = trim(strtoupper($paramsArray[$checkField['field']])); $allowedChars = explode('|',\"A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z|-| |.|'\"); for($i=0; $i\u003cstrlen($checkValue); $i++) { if(!in_array($checkValue[$i],$allowedChars)) { $invalidChars = true; } } if($invalidChars) { $errorMsgs[] = $checkField['name'] . ' contains invalid characters'; } } } } This isn't the worst approach to this problem I've seen in PHP, but the fact that this is just a copy/pasted blob, and worse- the $allowedChars may vary a bit in each place it's copy/pasted is what makes it terrible. Don't worry. The new CEO only stayed for 18 months, got a huge bonus thanks to all the cost-cutting, and then left, taking Pierre along to the next company.

    "description": "Python's \"batteries included\" approach means that a lot of common tasks have high-level convenience functions for them. For example, if you want to read all the lines from a file into an array (list, in Python), you could do something like: with open(filename) as f: lines = f.readlines() Easy peasy. Of course, because it's so easy, there are other options. For example, you can just convert the file directly to a list: lines = list(f). Or you can iterate across the file directly, e.g.: with open(filename) as f: for line in f: # do stuff Of course, that's fine for plain old text files. But we frequently use text files which are structured in some fashion, like a CSV file. No worries, though, as Python has a csv library built in, which makes it easy to handle these files too; especially useful because \"writing a CSV parser yourself\" is one of those tasks that sounds easy until you hit the first edge case, and then you realize you've made a terrible mistake. Now, it's important to note that CSV usually is expressed as a \"comma separated values\" file, but the initialism is actually \"character separated values\". And, as Sally's co-worker realized, newlines are characters, and thus every text file is technically a CSV file. foo = list(csv.reader(someFile, delimiter=\"\\n\")) .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.
