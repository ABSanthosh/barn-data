    "description": "This office employee reached his boiling point after upper management told his direct boss to stop sharing their input about everyone's workload. When it's the department head who's on the ground in the office sharing insights and feedback from their workers, perhaps you should listen to him instead of setting unattainable quarterly goals.\"If we want your input, we will ask for it. Period.\"After getting surveyed by the C-level bosses upstairs, this manager was under heavy scrutiny for his empathetic management tactics. They called for an emergency company-wide meeting just to criticize his managing style, only to realize after $10k worth of damages that he actually had some insightful advice. Keep scrolling to read how out-of-touch upper management paid the price when a lower-level employee snapped under the pressure of their impossible expectations.After this, here's another tale of upper management stupidity where a hiring manager refuses to even look at the job application of a cancer survivor because of the gap in his resume from undergoing chemo.",

    "description": "\"The law is the law,\" this person bragged as they made their neighbor replace his whole entire fence. Sometimes the impulse toward pettiness can pay off! U/Sospuff has an awful neighbor who is making a big fuss over the fence the two of them share. It's not an ideal situation: this person has three kids, and the neighbor has a dog that the original poster believes poses a danger. It's understandable that this person would want to protect their kids. However, as they shared in a post to r/pettyrevenge, even though the missing height of the fence is just a few centimeters, they aren't willing to let it go. The neighbor needs a fence that's two meters tall, and his is just under that amount. But since he's been such a pain for this person, including taking him to court before, this person is absolutely not willing to let it go. They posted an update, as well as defending themself from people who criticized their plan. You can read all about it down below! Up next, take a peek into the life of this free-spirited couple who showed up at a family member's house and decided to live there, leading the family member to realize they \"didn't sign up to be a hotel.\"",

    "description": "There's a big difference for cat pawrents between the first day of the weekend, where it's all a cute and cuddly Caturday, and the second day of the weekend, where it's a sassy and silly Sunday. On a Caturday, your cat greets you after a whole workweek where you've been away, and all they want is to receive all the pets from you and snuggle endlessly. But on a Sunday, your cat has had enough of this silly nonsense of a silly hooman being in their silly little space for far too long, so they enter the zoomies overdrive.To try and relax yourself and your cat, we prepared a bunch of fuzzy feline memes that you can watch together. And who knows, instead of your cat returning to their Caturday vibes, you might actually catch on to the Sunday sassy vibe and join your cat in the current zoomies session.",

I leaned over to Noah in the theater and shook him shouting “BLADE” when Wesley Snipes appeared. While I liked seeing Gambit on screen and I appreciate that Channing Tatum likes the character, I have to say I don’t really see him as Gambit. He tried very hard and I don’t even hate the accent but he just doesn’t physically look like Gambit to me. If they want to get serious I think they need to hire someone like Austin Butler who I think would kill the role accent and all.",

    "description": "ArSo works at a small company. It's the kind of place that has one software developer, and ArSo isn't it. But ArSo is curious about programming, and has enough of a technical background that small tasks should be achievable. After some conversations with management, an arrangement was made: Kurt, their developer, would identify a few tasks that were suitable for a beginner, and would then take some time to mentor ArSo through completing them. It sounded great, especially because Kurt was going to provide sample code which would give ArSo a head start on getting things done. What better way to learn than by watching a professional at work? DateTime datTmp; File.Copy(strFileOld, strFileNew); // 2 seconds delay datTmp = DateTime.Now; while (datTmp.Second == DateTime.Now.Second); datTmp = DateTime.Now; while (datTmp.Second == DateTime.Now.Second); File.Delete(strFileOld); This code copies a file from an old path to a new path, and then deletes the old path after a two second delay. Why is there a delay? I don't know. Why is the delay written like this? I can't possibly explain that. Check the time at the start of the loop. When the second part of that time stops matching the second part of the current time, we assume one second has passed. This is, of course, inaccurate- if I check the time at 0:00:00.9999 a lot less than a second will pass. This delay is at most one second. In any case, ArSo has some serious questions about Kurt's mentorship, and writes: Now I don't know if I should ask for more coding tasks. Honestly, I think you should ask for more. Like, I think you should just take Kurt's job. You may be a beginner, but honestly, you're likely going to do a better job than this.
