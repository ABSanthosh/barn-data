    "description": "No one enjoys getting assigned a new task at work right before the end of the day. The reality of the matter is that most tasks can wait until tomorrow at that point, and if it cannot, then that's on management for holding off on assigning said task for so long.This story serves as yet another example of how communication within a strict corporate hierarchy can lead to bad business. Here, we have an employee who was asked to complete a task at 4:50 pm that was evidently urgent. This would be frustrating on any given day, but the fact that this happened on the precipice of a long holiday weekend only makes it so much worse. Thankfully, this dude had enough self-confidence to stand his ground and inform his boss that he would not be staying late under any circumstances. That's what you get, management!For more stories like this, check out this post about how management accused an employee of trying to sabotage the company.",

    "description": "Who among us wouldn't quit their job for double the salary? It'd be a hard question to say no to, that's for sure. No matter how much you love your job, you could vastly improve your life with double the amount of money. Usually, when you find a job that could double your salary, you have to inform your company that they either need to match that amount, or you'll be leaving. It's not personal, it's just finances. But still, some bosses think that your loyalty to their company should be stronger than your loyalty to the almighty dollar. An extra $50k, $100k, or even $120k like this person was offered, could all provide you with an amazing life. It would mean more vacations to luxurious destinations, or giving gifts to all your friends and family, or maybe buying a badly needed new car or home. Most bosses understand that loyalty just can't compete with all that… but not every boss gets it. This person had an odd interaction with a boss who did take that salary boost personally. This person, u/raredontstare, also posted an update a few weeks later sharing what happened in the aftermath of the whole situation. Check it out below!Then, read about these irritating bosses, like one who asked an employee, \"Can't you just be late to your other job? You have responsibilities here.\"",

We can try to avoid it as much as we can, but it's just a part of getting older. Well, this sweet senior cat started having some breathing problems, and it worried her owners. She is 15 years old, after all (although to us, she doesn't look a day over 10). Well, they did the responsible thing and took her to the vet. The answer they got though, was not what they expected!Spoiler alert: she's purrfectly healthy, but she's thicc with a capital T, fluffier than a stack of pancakes, a plus-sized powerhouse….she's chonky (and yet funky!). The only thing she needs to get healthier is a few less treats, a diet, and a bit of exercise. It's as relieving as it is funny, and we think that you'll get a kick out of this hissterical cat story below. It's certainly a pocket of sunshine on this cloudy, winter day. Enjoy!",

    "description": "The way from a Monday to the weekend might be long, but it's never as long as a cat who has to wait 3 hours between meals. It is known that the time it takes a cat to wait between their feeding times is the longest waiting time in existence. Just as the laws of physics do not apply to cats (hence cats are liquid, actually), so does the concept of time. The time it takes any of us, humble hoomans, to wait between meals, is nothing like the passage of time for the same thing to a cat. That's why cats think they're famished 5 minutes after their meal is done - time doesn't act for them the same way it does for us. Yes, that must be the reason for it…Since this is why cats have this huge hunger, the concepts of cats and food are inseparable when it comes to cat memes. There are so many foodie feline memes out there, we just had to gather some to demonstrate it all.",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/a-pair-of-loops",
    "description": "Alexandra inherited a codebase that, if we're being kind, could be called \"verbose\". Individual functions routinely cross into multiple thousands of lines, with the longest single function hitting 4,000 lines of code. Very little of this is because the problems being solved are complicated, and much more of it is because people don't understand how anything works. For example, in this C++ code, they have a vector of strings. The goal is to create a map where the keys are the strings from the vector, and the values are more strings, derived from a function call. Essentially, what they wanted was: for (std::string val : invec) { umap[val] = lookupValue(val); } This would have been the sane, obvious way to do things. That's not what they did. unordered_map func(vector invec) { unordered_map umap; vector idxvec; for(string name : invec) { umap[name] = \"\"; idxvec.push_back(make_pair(name, \u0026umap[name])); } for(auto thingy : idxvec) { //actual work, including assigning the string thingy.get\u003c1\u003e() = lookupValue(thingy.get\u003c0\u003e()); } return umap; } I won't pick on names here, as they're clearly anonymized. But let's take a look at the approach they used. They create their map, and then create a new vector- a vector which is a pair- a string and a pointer to a string. Already, I'm confused by why any of this is happening, but let's press on and hope it becomes clear. We iterate across our input vector, which this I get. Then we create a key in the map and give it an empty string as a value. Then we create a pair out of our key and our pointer to that empty string. That's how we populate our idxvec vector. Once we've looped across all the values once, we do it again. This time, we pull out those pairs, and set the value at the pointer equal to the string returned by lookup value. Which leads us all to our favorite letter of the alphabet: WHY? I don't know. I also am hesitant to comment to much on the memory management and ownership issues here, as with the anonymization, there may be some reference management that got lost. But the fact that we're using bare pointers certainly makes this code more fraught than it needed to be. And, given how complex the STL data structures can be, I think we can also agree that passing around bare pointers to memory inside those structures is a recipe for disaster, even in simple cases like this. What I really enjoy is that they create a vector of pairs, without ever seeming to understand that a list of pairs is essentially what a map is. In conclusion: can we at least agree that, from now on, we won't iterate across the same values twice? I think about 15% of WTFs would go away if we all followed that rule. Oh, wait, no. People who could understand rules like that aren't the ones writing this kind of code. Forget I said anything.

Steven J Pemberton deserves full credit for this finding. \"My bank helpfully reminds me when it's time to pay my bill, and normally has no problem getting it right. But this month, the message sent Today 08:02, telling me I had to pay by tomorrow 21-Nov was sent on... 21-Nov. The amount I owed was missing the decimal point. They then apologised for freaking me out, but got that wrong too, by not replacing the placeholder for the amount I really needed to pay. \"   Faithful Michael R. levels a charge of confusion against what looks like.. Ticketmaster, maybe? \"My card indeed ends with 0000. Perhaps they do some weird math with their cc numbers to store them as numerics.\" It's not so much weird math as simply reification. Your so called \"credit card number\" is not actually a number; it is a digit string. And the last four digits are also a digit string.   Marc Würth, who still uses Facebook, gripes that their webdevs also don't understand the difference between numbers and digit strings. \"Clicking on Mehr dazu (Learn more), tells me: \u003e About facebook.com on older versions of mobile browsers \u003e [...] \u003e Visit facebook.com from one of these browsers, if it’s available to download on your mobile device: \u003e [...] \u003e Firefox (version 48 or higher) \u003e [...] Um...

Grumbles DC \"Somebody please explain to me how 5+2+2+2+2+2+2+0.75+2+2=23. If WebAssign itself can't even master basic arithmetic, how can I trust it teaching me calculus? \"   Finally Andrew C. has a non-mathematical digit or two to share, assuming you're inclined to obscure puns. \"As well as having to endure the indignity of job seeking, now I get called names too!\" This probably requires explanation for those who are not both native speakers of the King's English and familiar with cryptographic engineering.   [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds.

I'm not trying to say they're dumb liars; full synchronicity with our personal ethics requires a nearly cosmic level of effort, and in my experience always comes with painful sacrifice, which is why most people are content merely to describe this wicked gulf in others. But it actually seems to be happening, this time. There is a sundering of sorts, the kind of thing you would read in the Silmarillion. At least, I think. I've never read it. But it's still true: BlueSky and Threads are now functional, catalyzed venues for discourse with varying levels or intentions to Federate. Federation is sort of a sophisticated concept to explain, but it might be reasonable here to say that it is an orthogonal philosophy to the Internet as it works now. Another way of saying it: Federation has ideas in common with the Internet that was stolen from us.",
