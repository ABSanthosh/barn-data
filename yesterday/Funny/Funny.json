    "description": "When starting a completely new career, it's scary. You don't have any experience in this new work environment and you're afraid you won't know what to do. Sure, on paper you might technically not have any experience, but life isn't so black and white. Life experiences that have nothing to do with your new job might actually come very in handy. The point is, you never know! So don't be too afraid starting a new job, you might not have experience on paper, but you weren't born yesterday—you have life experience.  Take, for instance, this ex-pro female wrestler. She started working the nightshift at a new boutique hotel. Corporate sent someone to check out the staff and he said she was \"rough around the edges.\" However, he said to apply the acting that is necessary in wrestling for when she deals with guests. And guess what? It worked! But it wasn't just the acting that came in handy…",

    "description": "Have you ever been fired? It doesn't even matter if it's from a job you were expecting it from or even hoping it from—it still does not feel good. The anxiety you instantly feel inside is like an elephant on your chest. Even when it's a toxic job that you wanted to leave, it isn't until a few days later do you feel any sense of relief. That being said, sometimes you are able to mentally prepare prior to the actual firing and in that moment you can decided whether to bow out quietly and keep your peace or go out with a bang and get some petty revenge.  Obviously, we encourage leaving with your peace… but we LOVE when people leave with a bang! The internet is filled with stories about fired employees getting their last hoorah before exiting that toxic workplace for good and we can't get enough of 'em! Here you see an employee who was bull!ed from day one getting her revenge and we applaud her.",

    "description": "Cat… I am your father. Every Star Wars-loving cat pawrent has tried to convince their feline that they come from a long bloodline of Jedi knights, but for some reason, our lazy kitties just want to lull about in the sunshine of the windowsill instead of fulfilling their destiny to defy the Empire. Alas, despite my cat's obvious Jedi reflexes and keen ability to control my thoughts ('these are the cat treats you're looking for'), he still won't pick up a lightsaber. Purrhaps, the only option is to inundate this cat with the lore of the galaxy once again, watching and rewatching our favorite Star Wars flicks in honor of May 4th. Sing the songs of an infamous intergalactic jazz band, and may the Force guide your feline through their late-night zoomies, skittering like young Skywalker in his first pod race on Tatooine. For the Force is mysterious and powerful, binding all life and bringing joy to everyone—just like the cuddles of a floofy, soft cat.",

    "description": "Hey there, feline fanatics. Gather round for a heart-stealing tale featuring one of the most chaotic and cherished carb-loving cats we have ever met. This story begins not with a meow, but with a mouthful of tacos. That is right, one unsuspecting day, a spicy little street cat was caught red-pawed snacking on street tacos and decided, then and there, to follow two roommates home. They did not stand a chance.The cat, now named Ezekiel (or Zeke, or Creature), quickly made himself at home. Over the years, he has stolen not just bread and snacks, but hearts too. He has earned a reputation as a total menace, but one that his humans fiercely love. From bread thievery to constant supervision of any unattended carbs, Zeke's daily antics keep his housemates on their toes and their baked goods hidden away. And it does not end there. Zeke was immortalized for their friend's birthday in a custom art piece as a taco, naturally, complete with all his favorite fixings like orejas and whipped cream. Because when you adopt a taco thief, you go all in.",

    "description": "For testing networking systems, load simulators are useful: send a bunch of realistic looking traffic and see what happens as you increase the amount of sent traffic. These sorts of simulators often rely on being heavily multithreaded, since one computer can, if pushed, generate a lot of network traffic. Thus, when Jonas inherited a heavily multithreaded system for simulating load, that wasn't a surprise. The surprise was that the developer responsible for it didn't really understand threading in Java. Probably in other languages too, but in this case, Java was what they were using. public void startTraffic() { Configuration.instance.inititiateStatistics(); Statistics.instance.addStatisticListener(gui); if (t != null) { if (t.isAlive()) { t.destroy(); } } t = new Thread(this); t.start(); } Look, this is not a good way to manage threads in Java. I don't know if I'd call it a WTF, but it's very much a \"baby's first threading\" approach. There are better abstractions around threads that would avoid the need to manage thread instances directly. I certainly don't love situations where a Runnable also manages its own thread instance. This is almost certainly a race condition, but I don't know if this function is called from multiple threads (but I suspect it might be). But what's more interesting is where this code gets called. You see, starting a thread could trigger an exception, so you need to handle that: public void run() { while (true) { try { loaderMain.startTraffic(); break; } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(\"Exception in main loader thread!\"); e.printStackTrace(); } } } Inside of an infinite loop, we try to start traffic. If we succeed, we break out of the loop. If we fail, well, we try and try again and again and again and again and again and again… Jonas writes: Since I'm the only one that dares to wade through the opaque mess of code that somehow, against all odds, manages to work most of the time, I get to fix it whenever it presents strange behavior. I suspect it's going to present much more strange behavior in the future. [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds. Learn more.",
