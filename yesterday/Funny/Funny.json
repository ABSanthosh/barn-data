    "description": "Working in a short-staffed environment is the absolute worst. If you have experienced this, then you understand. Being the only employee in a place that caters to hundreds of people is a nightmare. Unfortunately, it happens all the time. Being short-staffed during a nightshift is even worse. You don't even have a co-worker to keep you awake and attentive! Take hotels, for example, they have people at the front desk almost 24/7. Hotels usually cater to hundreds to people. So having only one person on the entire staff for any certain hour seems ridiculous, but alas, yet again, it happens all too often. Take this woman on TikTok. She recently quit her job at the front desk of a hotel and even posted the video of the exact interaction. She recorded it for her own safety. She was working alone, until 11pm. No kitchen staff, security, house keeping, no one—just her. A man kept coming down requesting she come to his room for certain things that needed done. She refused each time, since that is terrifying. Finally, when he started getting pushy, she told him she could call her manager. When she did, her manager insisted that she do whatever the man said because he brought in a lot of money to the hotel. Flabbergasted that her manager chose money in his pocket over his employees safety, she quit over the phone right then and there. See it all unfold below!",

    "description": "We all have idyllic visions of our family, especially our grandparents, at least for those of us who were fortunate to grow up with grandparents who showed us nothing but love and kindness.It's weird, though, when you grow up and realize that your own in-laws are also going to be your kid's grandparents and extended family—which puts everything into a new perspective. And no matter how you feel about your in-laws, there are always going to be some strained moments. What's somehow even stranger, though, is coming to find that for your sibling's kids, you're either \"dad's side\" or \"mom's side\" of the family.Anyways, given how we feel about our grandparents, if your kid is telling you in earnest that they don't feel comfortable going to grandma's house, that alone is saying something. These parents didn't feel comfortable letting the kids go around to their grandmother's house with her relatively unknown boyfriends around, their repeated refusal to let the kids come over prompted her to take matters into her own hands, resulting in this confrontation. Frustrated, the mother shared her story with this online community to see if she was wrong for her part in the escalation. See a selection of the story below, along with some of the community's responses.",

Because everyone knows that for some reason, every year, cats decide to have a war with Christmas. Or maybe it's not a war. Maybe it's love that's making cats get inside of Christmas trees the second that they are put up. But everyone knows that love can lead to chaos, and the same is true for cats and Christmas trees.And so, another year, and the madness continues. It's only the beginning of December, and not all of us have put up their trees yet, but the ones of us who decided to start the party a little earlier than most are already experiencing the meowgic of Christmas, because cats don't care how early, they will get up on those Christmas trees and make sure that the party starts instantly.",

All of a sudden, we're wrapped up in giant, poofy coats, bundled up in scarves and hats, and wishing we were back inside underneath the coziness of our comforters (well, that's nothing new). With this cold winter weather and the sun going down earlier and earlier, we can't be bothered to go outside at all. In fact, we've been inside so much that even our cats are starting to get tired of us! That's why we've collected a flurry of feline funnies for you to pursue while weathering the cold winter winds (from the warmth of your own home).No matter rain or shine, snow or sleet, these cold-weather cat memes are sure to keep your hearts and fingers warm while any sort of storm rages outside. Now we just need a cup of hot chocolate to keep us company while our cats take up the whole heater. Not only is it the purrfect day to stay inside, but it's also the purrfect day to scroll through these feline funnies. Enjoy!",

Only this time they have forgotten their long-time clients on legacy packages.\"   Then he found a few more effs. \"This e-shop required to create an account to download an invoice for order already delivered. Which is kind of WTF on its own. But when I pasted a generated 62 mixed character (alphanumeric+special) password, their form still insisted on entering 8+ characters. not correct.

Rather than an error reported as success, we appear to have here a success reported as an error. \"We're all familiar with apps that throw up an eror dialog with the error message as success but it's particularly irritating when trying to submit a payment. This is what happened when I tried to pay for an Indian visa with Paypal. To add insult to injury, when you try to pay again, it says that due to errors and network problems, you must check back in 2 hours before attempting a repeat payment.\"   Finally Robert H. is all charged up about Chevy shenanigans. \"I thought one of the advantages of EV vehicles was they don't need oil changes?\"   [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.
