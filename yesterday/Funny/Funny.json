    "description": "Carpooling is cool because it saves money and the environment. What's not to love? You get a buddy to chat with to and from your destination, can rest those precious legs of yours instead of taking public transit, and leave less of a carbon footprint. Many employees opt to carpool with their colleagues for many reasons, but one of the most common is that it's simply convenient, sometimes, way more convenient for one person than the other. You'd think that if you're the guest in someone else's car, you'd offer to split gas, perhaps do them a favor or two, and most definitely make their life a tad bit easier at work.The colleague in this next story fails to do any of the above. The employee took it upon themselves to have their mother, and then in the future, themselves, drive their colleague to work because the taxis in their neighborhood stop at a certain hour. This left their colleague transportation-less, so they did what any good coworker would do: give her rides home. This proves to be a major mistake after the employee realizes they've created an entitled monster. Scroll below to read the entire story.",

If we could, we would move into the forest and surround ourselves with only our fluffy feline friends, we would. However, we have less than zero survival skills and our cats wouldn't survive without their Fancy Feast, so we're stuck here in this endless cycle of working, eating, sleeping, relying on our cute cats for happiness, and doing it all over again. Luckily, we have a few tricks up our sleeves to keep our pawsitivity up, no matter what life may throw at us. One of those tricks is making sure we have access to a soft, purring cat as often as pawssible, and the second is to scroll through as many silly cat memes as we need in order to smile. Sometimes it's two, sometimes it's 27, but they always do the trick. There are quite a few below, so treat yourself to some pawsitivity with the power of purrs below!Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

    "description": "One of the beautiful things about the cat distribution system - which is totally real and is working hard each and every day - is that it can catch you anywhere. You could be going on a hike when a kitten jumps out at you out of nowhere and forces you to adopt it. You could be having a regular day, chilling at home, when a cat randomly walks into your house. You could be having a midnight picnic and get adopted by a cat out of absolutely nowhere. That's the thing - once you get chosen, there is no going back from it. Once a cat chooses to adopt a human, the world will provide it with a good human to adopt. \"The world\". We mean the cat distribution system. It's the only thing that can explain stories like this - a man simply going to work, a kitten coming out of nowhere, essentially demanding to be adopted and… that's right, getting adopted right then and there. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.

She was willing to give Sunderfolk a shot and has fallen completely in love with it, to the point that she asks me if we can play when I get home. I love that I can share something I have always enjoyed with her now. I hope we get more games like this in the future. Thanks again.  -Erik I love Secret Door, I love Dreamhaven, and I love Sunderfolk.  I did a sponsored panel for Sunderfolk at PAX with a bunch of other cool people and I charged zero dollars.  That's how cool I think it is.  There are quite a few gamers on PC that don't really understand \"Jackbox Gloomhaven,\" the phone as a controller for a co-op tactics feast is either alien or distasteful, like trying to play the game with a dead rat.  I wonder sometimes if it could have a different life with a PC specific UI, but that's neither here nor there - I'm glad you two are having fun with it.  If you need naming suggestions for any of the things you discover obviously we're here to help.

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/a-second-date",
    "description": "Ah, bad date handling. We've all seen it. We all know it. So when Lorenzo sent us this C# function, we almost ignored it: private string GetTimeStamp(DateTime param) { string retDate = param.Year.ToString() + \"-\"; if (param.Month \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Month.ToString() + \"-\"; else retDate = retDate + param.Month.ToString() + \"-\"; if (param.Day \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Day.ToString() + \" \"; else retDate = retDate + param.Day.ToString() + \" \"; if (param.Hour \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Hour.ToString() + \":\"; else retDate = retDate + param.Hour.ToString() + \":\"; if (param.Minute \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Minute.ToString() + \":\"; else retDate = retDate + param.Minute.ToString() + \":\"; if (param.Second \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Second.ToString() + \".\"; else retDate = retDate + param.Second.ToString() + \".\"; if (param.Millisecond \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Millisecond.ToString(); else retDate = retDate + param.Millisecond.ToString(); return retDate; } Most of this function isn't terribly exciting. We've seen this kind of bad code before, but even when we see a repeat like this, there are still special treats in it. Look at the section for handling milliseconds: if the number is less than 10, they pad it with a leading zero. Just the one, though. One leading zero should be enough for everybody. But that's not the thing that makes this code special. You see, there's another function worth looking at: private string FileTimeStamp(DateTime param) { string retDate = param.Year.ToString() + \"-\"; if (param.Month \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Month.ToString() + \"-\"; else retDate = retDate + param.Month.ToString() + \"-\"; if (param.Day \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Day.ToString() + \" \"; else retDate = retDate + param.Day.ToString() + \" \"; if (param.Hour \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Hour.ToString() + \":\"; else retDate = retDate + param.Hour.ToString() + \":\"; if (param.Minute \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Minute.ToString() + \":\"; else retDate = retDate + param.Minute.ToString() + \":\"; if (param.Second \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Second.ToString() + \".\"; else retDate = retDate + param.Second.ToString() + \".\"; if (param.Millisecond \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Millisecond.ToString(); else retDate = retDate + param.Millisecond.ToString(); return retDate; } Not only did they fail to learn the built-in functions for formatting dates, they forgot about the functions they wrote for formatting dates, and just wrote (or realistically, copy/pasted?) the same function twice. At least both versions have the same bug with milliseconds. I don't know if I could handle it if they were inconsistent about that. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.

    "description": "Yitzchak was going through some old web code, and found some still in-use JavaScript to handle compatibility issues with older Firefox versions. if ($.browser.mozilla \u0026\u0026 $.browser.version.slice(0, 1) == '1') { … } What a marvel. Using JQuery, they check which browser is reported- I suspect JQuery is grabbing this from the user-agent string- and then its version. And if the version has a 1 in its first digit, we apply a \"fix\" for \"compatibility\". I guess it's a good thing there will never be more than 9 versions of Firefox. I mean, what version are they on now? Surely the version number doesn't start with a \"1\", nor has it started with a \"1\" for some time, right?
