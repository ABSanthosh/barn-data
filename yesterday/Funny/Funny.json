    "description": "Instead of just making their own highly specific foods at home, some people love to go out to a restaurant and insist that the chef whip them up something special. This type of customer will go to a seafood restaurant and request a special burger. They'll go to a pizza place and insist that they want a small pepperoni pizza… with no pepperoni. No idea what that could mean! The person taking that pizza order also had no clue what that customer was requesting, but to their credit, most restaurant staffers try very hard to give their customers exactly what they want. Some folks just have utterly ridiculous requests, though. Like there's one person who wouldn't eat any of his hash browns? Were they soggy, burnt, or dry? Nope! They were just too hot. Hmm… if only that problem could solve itself in under 5 minutes. After you read these restaurant requests, weigh in on this story of a couple who were confronted by their waiter after not tipping on a $30 bill: \"You're not tipping?!\"",

    "description": "Let's get this out of the way first: WiFi should be free. It's one of those fundamental services that everyone needs in order to connect with the world, no matter how old you are. At this point, it's not a luxury; it's a need. Perhaps there are still some dinosaurs out there who don't fully understand that the vast majority of individuals cannot pay their bills, do their jobs, complete their work, or keep in touch with family without a functional WiFi connection.This, of course, is why when those connections suddenly fail out of nowhere, panic mode settles in. This is especially true when you're in the middle of something important, such as a meeting, an interview, or a class. When this happened to the author of this story in the middle of an important presentation, he impulsively connected to a neighbor's account that wasn't password protected. This would eventually backfire in surprising ways…",

When you make a meal for a loved one, help out a colleague with a problem or even just chat with an old friend who could do with some emotional venting, you are always giving from your heart.And eventually, whether we like it or not, we end up running on empty, because you cannot keep giving without taking something back for yourself. So we wanted to help you out and pawtect your purrfect heart with this list of heart-filling feline funnies fur when you are running on empty. These wholesome cattos care not for the contents of your heart, at best they want crunchies, but what they are great for is filling your heart to the brim with beautiful, bouncy feline energy.

    "description": "Every cat owner knows that one of the main advantages of having cats over dogs is that they are self-sufficient. You can stay stress-free while spending 8+ hours at work while your fluffy felines nap at home, and then enjoy their screams for food as you walk in the door. You can even go away for a weekend every once in a while with just someone to check in on them and make sure they have enough food and water. Dogs, however, need walks in the middle of the day and are not the best at staying home alone. That doesn't mean that you can go away for multiple days at a time, constantly, and expect them to be okay. No house cat is that self-sufficient. That's why the flatmate in the story below is deciding to confront her roommate about being a bad pawrent - she leaves her cat alone for multiple days at a time, constantly, and just recently was gone for 9 days. Do you think she should say something? Read through all the details below.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

    "description": "A recent code-review on a new build pipeline got Sandra's attention (previously). The normally responsible and reliable developer responsible for the commit included this in their Jenkinsfile: sh ''' if ! command -v yamllint \u0026\u003e /dev/null; then if command -v apt-get \u0026\u003e /dev/null; then apt-get update \u0026\u0026 apt-get install -y yamllint elif command -v apk \u0026\u003e /dev/null; then apk add --no-cache yamllint elif command -v pip3 \u0026\u003e /dev/null; then pip3 install --break-system-packages yamllint fi fi find . -name '*.yaml' -exec yamllint {} \\\\; || true find . -name '*.yml' -exec yamllint {} \\\\; || true ''' So the goal of this script is to check to see if the yamllint command is available. If it isn't, we check if apt-get is available, and if it is, we use that to install yamllint. Failing that, we try apk, Alpine's package manager, and failing that we use pip3 to install it out of PyPI. Then we run it against any YAML files in the repo. There are a few problems with this approach. The first, Sandra notes, is that they don't use Alpine Linux, and thus there's no reason to try apk. The second is that this particular repository contains no Python components and thus pip is not available in the CI environment. Third, this CI job runs inside of a Docker image which already has yamllint installed. Now, you'd think the developer responsible would have known this, given that this very merge request also included the definition of the Dockerfile for this environment. They'd already installed yamllint in the image. Sandra writes: This kind of sloppiness is also wildly out of character for him, to the point where my first thought was that it was AI-generated - especially since this was far from the only WTF in the submitted Jenkinsfile. Thankfully, it didn't pass code review and was sent back for intensive rework. Finally, while the reality is that we'll always need to resolve some dependencies at build time, things like \"tooling\" and \"linters\" really belong in the definition of the build environment, not resolved at build time.
