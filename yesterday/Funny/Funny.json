    "description": "When maintaining million-dollar machines is the singular focus of your work, you'd hope that your manager would leave well enough alone and trust you to know how to do your thing. Alas, when it comes to new management, leaving well enough alone is something that is never in the playbook, a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach taking precedence over logical reason.This machine operator worked at an aerospace manufacturing company, executing an efficient routine by starting work early to ensure that machines were calibrated and ready to begin production before the machinist's shift began. This, of course, made logical sense as having to run these procedures while everyone else was present would do nothing but hold up production. Management insisted that they follow a new schedule and stick to their scheduled hours,  causing the production line to grind to a halt while they completed calibration. The disruption and resulting losses eventually forced management's hand and allowed the operator to return to their old routine.",

    "description": "There are laws in place that protect an employee when they're in recovery. This can look like FMLA or taking company-approved sick leave while the employee can get back on their feet. If the employee comes back before they're ready (either physically or mentally), the workplace can be liable for anything that happens to them on the job. Companies might not be happy about extended sick leave, but they'd definitely be better off without their employee for a few weeks than to get obliterated in a lawsuit.The employee in this Reddit story dealt with an entitled boss who they never really liked. Everything about their personality screamed toxicity, thus making the workplace a not-so-fun place to be. This specific employee was recovering from surgery and the story starts on one of their first days back on the job. During an overwhelming shift, the employee collapses and faints. Right when they come to, their boss tells them they need to get back on the floor. Instead of letting this slide, the employee dishes out their two-week notice.",

Any one of the wargames that Games Workshop makes could be your entire life - they could certainly be your entire paycheck. They were playing Kill Team and Warhammer 40k 9th edition at the same time, and it didn't help that each of these games shares some language that doesn't actually mean the same thing in the different contexts. Plus, the 9th Edition of 40k just isn't as fun as the new one - they got a taste of 10 and they're sticking with it, despite my most fervent attempts.",

    "description": "The most common type of submission Error'd receives are simple, stupid, data problems on Amazon. The text doesn't match the image, the pricing is goofy, or some other mixup that are just bound to happen with a database of zillions of products uploaded by a plethora of barely-literate mountain village drop-shippers. So I don't usually feature them, preferring to find something with at least a chance of being a creative new bug. But I uncovered a story by Mark Johansen about his favorite author, and decided that since so many of you obviously DO think online retail flubs are noteworthy, what the heck. Here is Mark's plain-text story, and a handful of bungled products. They're not exactly bugs, but at least some of them are about bugs. \"I guess I missed your item about failings of AI, but here's one of my favorites: Amazon regularly sends me emails of books that their AI thinks I might want to read, presumably based on books that I've bought from them in the past. So recently I got an email saying, \"The newest book by an author you've read before!\" And this new book was by ... Ernest Hemingway. Considering that he died almost 60 years ago, it seemed unlikely that he was still writing. Or where he was sending manuscripts from. Lest you wonder, it turned out it was a collection of letters he wrote when he was, like, actually alive. The book was listed as authored by Ernest Hemingway rather than under the name of whomever compiled the letters.\" What do we all think? Truly an Error'd, or just some publisher taking marketing advice from real estate agents? Let me know. A while back, Christian E. \"Wanted to order some groceries from nemlig.com. So I saw the free (labelled GRATIS) product and pressed the info button and this popped up. Says that I can get the product delivered from the 1st of January (today is the 2nd of march). Have to wait for a while then...\" Not too much longer, Christian.   Reliable Michael R. muttered \"msofas either have their special math where 5% always is GBP10 or they know already what I want to buy.\"   \"Do not feed to vegetarians.\" warns Jeffrey B.   \"Not sure how this blue liquid works for others, but there has been no sucking here yet,\" reports Matthias.   \"Nice feature but I am not sure if it can fit in my notebook,\" writes Tiger Fok.   Lady-killer Bart-Jan is preparing for Friday night on the town, apparently. Knock 'em dead, Bart! \"It says 'Fragrance for Men'. Which is fine, as long as it also does a good job deterring the female mosquitoes.\"   [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.

Does their portfolio contain work similar to what you're asking them to do? What's the average experience of their team? What are the agreed upon code quality standards for the contract? You could do that, or you could hire the cheapest company. Guess which one Damiano's company did? If you're not sure, look at this code: if(jQuery('table').hasClass('views-view-grid')){ var EPid= \".views-view-grid\"; jQuery(EPid +' td').each(function(){ if(!jQuery(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().hasClass('view-article-in-right-sidebar') \u0026\u0026 !jQuery(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().hasClass('view-offers-in-right-sidebar')){ var title = jQuery(this).find(\"h2 a\").html(); var body = jQuery(this).find(\".field-name-body\").html(); var datetime = jQuery(this).find(\".field-name-field-event-date-time\").html(); var flyer = jQuery(this).find(\".field-name-field-flyer a\").attr(\"href\"); var imageThumb = jQuery(this).find(\".field-name-field-image-thumb\").html(); var readMore = 'jQuery(this).find(\"h2 a\").attr(\"href\")+'\" class=\"read-more\"\u003eREAD MORE'; var str = ''; if(title != null \u0026\u0026 title != \"\"){ if(imageThumb \u0026\u0026 imageThumb != \"\" \u0026\u0026 imageThumb != null) str = str + imageThumb; if(datetime \u0026\u0026 datetime != \"\" \u0026\u0026 datetime != null) str = str + ''+datetime+''; str = str + ''+title+''; str = str + body + ''; str = str + readMore; } if(flyer) str = str + ''\"\u003etype == \"events\"){ echo 'download the flyer'; }else {echo 'download the article';} ?\u003e'; str = str + ''; jQuery(this).children('.node').remove(); jQuery(this).append(str); } }); This was in a Drupal project. The developer appointed by the contractor didn't know Drupal at all, and opted to build all the new functionality by dropping big blobs of JavaScript code on top of it. There's so much to hate about this. We can start with the parent().parent() chains. Who doesn't love to make sure that your JavaScript code is extremely fragile against changes in the DOM, while at the same time making it hard to read or understand. I like that we create the EPid variable to avoid having a magic string inside our DOM query, only to still need to append a magic string to it. It hints at some programming by copy/paste. Then there's the pile of HTML-by-string-concatenation, which is always fun. But this couldn't be complete without this moment: type == \"events\"){ echo 'download the flyer'; }else {echo 'download the article';} ?\u003e Oh yeah, buried in this unreadable blob of JavaScript there's a little bonus PHP, just to make it a little spicier. The entire project came back from the contractor in an unusable state. The amount of re-work just to get it vaguely functional quickly outweighed any potential cost savings. And even after that work went it, it remained a buggy, unmaintainable mess. Did management learn their lesson? Absolutely not- they bragged about how cheaply they got the work done at every opportunity, and entered into a partnership agreement with the subcontractor. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time. ProGet costs less than half of Artifactory and is just as good. Our easy-to-read comparison page lays out the editions, features, and pricing of the different editions of ProGet and Artifactory.Learn More.",
