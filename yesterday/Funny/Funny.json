    "description": "Hello cat pawrents, do you work from home? Because if you do, we'd very much like to know how your cat feels about this. Is your cat happy you're home, trying to sit on your lap constantly despite your working schedule? Or is your cat feeling that you're bothering them too much, only by breathing near them for too much time? Or maybe your cat is ecstatic you're home, so excited they want to play with you all the time? There are many kinds of cats, and they'll all react differently to a cat pawrent who works from home.But we, hoomans, also react differently to that situation. But there is something we all react to with joy, laughter, and happiness - meowing cat memes. Cat memes are the delight of any cat pawrent. Whether you're working from home this Monday or not, we're sure you're going to enjoy these funny cat memes. We're also sure your cat will enjoy them as well, so show them to your cat if you're at home.",

    "description": "We could never understand people who abandon their cats. It's just such a strange concept to us. How could you just get up one day and decide to get rid of your family member, someone who depends on you, who has depended on you their whole lives, who has been with you and seen you and loved you? Baffling. And yet, people do it. We come across stories of people who abandon their cats all the time, leaving them to fend for themselves or, hopefully, get adopted by someone else. So, we have seen this happen. Truly, we have. And we have seen people debate whether to get rid of their cats or not because their new boyfriend or girlfriend \"hate cats\". It has happened before. But to have the audacity to then expect the shelter that found your cat to console you and make you feel better for doing this to your cat? That's a new low. Maybe they didn't deserve to have this beautiful cat in their lives in the first place.",

    "description": "This entitled teen's ego deflated faster than his popped tire when he disregarded his neighbor's demands. Turns out, trespassing on someone's land and in their flower garden gives them a tactical advantage for boobytrapped life lessons… Which is exactly what this rural gardener gave to the neighborhood bike terror. After months of tending a garden, it's encouraging to watch the buds flourish, sprouting new life in your yard and building a hobbyist's dream garden. However, that joy can be squashed in an instant by a rogue bike tire, destroying months—even years!—of hard work in the yard in a matter of seconds. Perhaps the next time this kid gets scolded by an avid gardener to steer clear of their flower box, they'll heed the warning and save themselves the trouble of losing an entire wheel at the hands of an errant, deliberate rusty nail.",

    "description": "Sometimes, the only way to show a choosing beggar that they're being ridiculous is to be ridiculous yourself. There are some folks who, despite being desperately in need of new supplies, are so entitled that they think they can get away with paying next to nothing for what they want. The most common place to find these desperate individuals is obviously Facebook Marketplace, where half of the people who claim they want to buy something lack the follow-through to actually purchase and pick up their item. Let this story serve as yet another example of what happens when choosing beggars underestimate the folks they are trying to swindle. In this instance, we have a seller who was trying to get rid of tires for half the original price, and yet this one entitled, choosing beggar thought he could negotiate paying just over 12% of the original value. He would end up regretting giving such an insulting offer.",

This does not work. This cannot work: the PHP code executes on the server, the client code executes on the client, and you need to be a lot more thoughtful about how they interact than this. And yet, the developer responsible has done this all over the code base, pushed the non-working code out to production, and when it doesn't work, just adds bug tickets to the backlog to eventually figure out why- tickets that never get picked up, because there's always something with a higher priority out there.
