    "description": "The new year has settled in, 2025 is already comfortable and cozy, but it means that last month Christmas was over and done. Christmas brings a time of happiness and joy, dotted with gifts, and these gifts sometimes happen to be animals. Now, we're not particularly against gifting a precious little pet to someone on a happy time such as Christmas, but we definitely do not endorse getting rid of such a gift as if it were any other toy or piece of clothing that doesn't fit. That is just plain cruelty, no matter how tough it suddenly became for a person to become a pawrent.Last month a humble hooman witnessed with his own eyes a kindle of kittens being thrown to the side of the road from a passing car. Maybe they were a \"discarded Christmas gift\"? It won't surprise us if this is the case, but our hooman hero of the story didn't have an opportunity to find out, since the car the kittens were thrown out of drove away fast. But this hearty hooman couldn't stay indifferent and took this litter in, found furever homes to all of them but one - who he now shares his home with.When his sassy kitten, Banks, grew up a little, his hooman turned to the online feline family to inquire about his potential breed - but we all know the online feline family, they did not stay indifferent to this touching rescue story. The reactions expressed everything from sadness about the initially intended fate of the cute kittens, through anger about the person who decided to throw them at the side of the road, to the wholesome gratitude for this hearty hooman who saved Banks and his kitten siblings. Oh, and also some funny reactions about the sassy pictures of the kitten… Scroll down to melt your feline-infatuated heart!",

    "description": "It's a hard place to be when you are an animal lover, but are getting terrorized by a domesticated animal. It's much more complicated than dealing with a wild animal, like raccoons or opossums, because now you have to deal with a human… And humans are much more stubborn if you can believe it (we definitely can). When someone's pet is misbehaving, it is the pet owner's fault, so you have to address them rather than the pet directly. This happens often when there are irresponsible pet owners who refuse to pick up after their beloved furry friends. It's not the pet's fault! They literally don't have thumbs. They couldn't pick up their droppings even if they wanted to! They'd have to eat it, and we all know that is very unhealthy…  So it's up to the human, and yet, there are many entitled and/or lazy pet owners out there who just don't care. If their pet wants to relieve themselves on your property, you should feel lucky. They aren't going to pick up the icky stuff! Their pets chose to do their business there, so there it shall be and you must accept that!! Well… No, no you don't.",

    "link": "https://cheezburger.com/38649093/employees-fed-up-after-company-cuts-90-of-their-big-annual-bonus-despite-promising-it-in-exchange",
    "description": "For some reason, it seems like companies and employers love to give employees hope and reasons for motivation, and then take it all away at the last moment. We all know that they love dangling promotions and raises over employees' heads even if they have no intention of giving them to anyone. And apparently, these are not the only motivations some companies use to squeeze more work out of their already hardworking (and overworking) employees.When a company wants to get their workers to do more work, without giving them anything in return, they can use what employers love to call 'an annual bonus'. It is a vague extra sum of money that companies add to workers' paychecks at the end of the year, that is supposed to reflect the appreciation of all the extra work employees have put in.If a company is truly evil, like most of us know they usually are, they can decide to simply not give that annual bonus at the end of the year, and ignore all the hard work they have put their workers through. How will the workers react to this move? Keep scrolling to read this story and find out.",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/crossly-joined",
    "description": "Antonio's team hired some very expensive contractors and consultants to help them build a Java based application. These contractors were very demure, very mindful, about how using ORMs could kill performance. So they implemented a tool that would let them know any time the Hibernate query generator attempted to perform a cross join. public class DB2390Dialect extends org.hibernate.dialect.DB2390Dialect { private Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(DB2390Dialect.class); @Override public String getCrossJoinSeparator() { try { Exception e = new Exception(); throw e; } catch (Exception xe) { logger.warn(\"cross join \", xe.getMessage()); } return \", \"; } } I'm going to call this one a near miss. I understand what they were trying to do. Hibernate uses a set of \"dialect\"s to convert logical operations in a query to literal syntax- as you can see here, this function turns a cross join operation into a \", \". What they wanted to do was detect where in the code this happened and log a message. They wanted the message to contain a stack trace, and that's why they threw an exception. Unfortunately, they logged, not the stack trace, but the message- a message which they're not actually setting. Thus, the logger would only ever log \"cross join \", but with no information to track down when or why it happened. That said, the standard way in Java of getting the stack trace skips the exception throwing: StackTraceElement[] st = new Throwable().getStackTrace(). Of course, that would have made them do some actual logging logic, and not just \"I dunno, drop the message in the output?\" The only remaining question is how much did this feature cost? Since these were \"expert consultants\", we can ballpark it as somewhere between \"a few thousand dollars\" to \"many thousands of dollars\"..
