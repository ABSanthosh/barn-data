    "description": "You don't always need to be paid back for everything in life: sometimes, you can just let something go for the good of your relationship. I think many friendships operate this way. You buy your friends some drinks one night, then they pay for the Uber ride home. Or you offer to pay for dinner, and the next time, they treat you to a home-cooked meal. If you're constantly bugging people for money that they owe you, especially if it's small amounts you're being stingy over, it may leave a bad taste in some people's mouths. When you Venmo request someone send you $3 for their portion of a meal tip, it makes you wonder if they're currently low on cash, or if they're just always side-eyeing you, calculating how much you owe them. On the other hand, if you share an expensive food with someone, like a cake that costs roughly $90, maybe you should be charging them by the slice. That's a costly dish! No doubt this 17-year-old would've chosen something else to snack on if she knew just how much it would cost her. And as her mom shared, it's also causing some issues in the family. Next, read about this CFO who got his expensive Corvette towed in a case of \"parking justice.\"",

Your coworkers and employees deserve a little bit of grace under these circumstances. Even if they saunter in ten minutes late with an iced coffee in their hands, that does not give you the right to make assumptions about their priorities or shame them for wanting some caffeine to be properly alert during the work day.However, there are instances in which some coworkers and employees take that grace period a little too far. Keep scrolling below for this tale of a terrible coworker who frequently came into work 3 hours late every Friday because she was getting her nails done.",

    "description": "Sometimes the burnout is simply larger than us. There is nothing we can do, nothing someone can say, that will keep the fiery flames of this burnout at bay. It is simply the nature of these things. And unfortunately in such situations we almost always turn to destructive behavior, and more often than not, it harms us rather than those around. Which is why we decided that you might manage to take a moment away from that maelstrom to indulge in some similarly destructive cattos to give the effect of looking in a mirror and watching your alternate self get into destructive situations, without you having to handle the consequences.So if you are ready to wash your hands of clawminal responsibility and pass it on to the felines who cannot be held accountable for their actions, then settle in and enjoy.",

You know, when you're moving in somewhere or when you're getting a new roommate, whether they have a cat or not. If you don't want it in your house, don't take the roommate. If you don't want roommate that will cause drama around your feline, ask about it, find out if and what they might have issues with. Seriously, we have seen so much drama that could have been avoided if only a few questions were asked. We have seen roommates lock cats in their rooms without permission. We have seen roommates get mad because they're allergic to cats even though they agreed to getting a roommate with a cat in the first place. We've seen roommates unexpectedly bring cats home even though the other roommates didn't know and didn't agree to it. Today's story… we don't know if this one could have been avoided. It seems like the roommates in question were either dumb or liars. Thankfully, the cat is okay. But really, ask some questions. Don't risk your cat.",

    "description": "Barry rolled into work at 8:30AM to see the project manager waiting at the door, wringing her hands and sweating. She paced a bit while Barry badged in, and then immediately explained the issue: Today was a major release of their new features. This wasn't just a mere software change; the new release was tied to major changes to a new product line- actual widgets rolling off an assembly line right now. And those changes didn't work. \"I thought we tested this,\" Barry said. \"We did! And Stu called in sick today!\" Stu was the senior developer on the project, who had written most of the new code. \"I talked to him for a few minutes, and he's convinced it's a data issue. Something in the metadata or something?\" \"I'll take a look,\" Barry said. He skipped grabbing a coffee from the carafe and dove straight in. Prior to the recent project, the code had looked something like this: if (IsProduct1(_productId)) _programId = 1; elseif (IsProduct2(_productId)) _programId = 2; elseif (IsProduct3(_productId)) _programId = 3; Part of the project, however, was about changing the workflow for \"Product 3\". So Stu had written this code: if (IsProduct1(_productId)) _programId = 1; else if (IsProduct2(_productId)) _programId = 2; else if (IsProduct3(_productId)) _programId = 3; DoSomethingProductId3Specific1(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific2(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific3(); Since this is C# and not Python, it took Barry all of 5 seconds to spot this and figure out what the problem was and fix it: if (IsProduct1(_productId)) { _programId = 1; } else if (IsProduct2(_productId)) { _programId = 2; } else if (IsProduct3(_productId)) { _programId = 3; DoSomethingProductId3Specific1(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific2(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific3(); } This brings us to about 8:32. Now, given the problems, Barry wasn't about to just push this change- in addition to running pipeline tests (and writing tests that Stu clearly hadn't), he pinged the head of QA to get a tester on this fix ASAP. Everyone worked quickly, and that meant by 9:30 the fix was considered good and ready to be merged in and pushed to production. Sometime in there, while waiting for a pipeline to complete, Barry managed to grab a cup of coffee to wake himself up. While Barry was busy with that, Stu had decided that he wasn't feeling that sick after all, and had rolled into the office around 9:00. Which meant that just as Barry was about to push the button to run the release pipeline, an \"URGENT\" email came in from Stu. \"Hey, everybody, I fixed that bug. Can we get this released ASAP?\" Barry went ahead and released the version that he'd already tested, but out of morbid curiosity, went and checked Stu's fix. if (IsProduct1(_productId)) _programId = 1; else if (IsProduct2(_productId)) _programId = 2; else if (IsProduct3(_productId)) { _programId = 3; } if (IsProduct3(_productId)) { DoSomethingProductId3Specific1(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific2(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific3(); } At least this version would have worked, though I'm not sure Stu fully understands what \"{}\"s mean in C#. Or in most programming languages, if we're being honest. With Barry's work, the launch went off just a few minutes later than the scheduled time. Since the launch was successful, at the next company \"all hands\", the leadership team made sure to congratulate the people instrumental in making it happen: that is to say, the lead developer of the project, Stu.

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/time-for-identification",
    "description": "If you need a unique ID, UUIDs provide a variety of options. It's worth noting that variants 1, 2, and 7 all incorporate a timestamp into the UUID. In the case of variant 7, this has the benefit of making the UUID sortable, which can be convenient in many cases (v1/v2 incorporate a MAC address which means that they're sortable if generated with the same NIC). I bring this up because Dave inherited some code written by a \"guru\". Said guru was working before UUIDv7 was a standard, but also didn't have any problems that required sortable UUIDs, and thus had no real reason to use timestamp based UUIDs. They just needed some random identifier and, despite using C#, didn't use the UUID functions built in to the framework. No, they instead did this: string uniqueID = String.Format(\"{0:d9}\", (DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks / 10) % 1000000000); A Tick is 100 nanoseconds. We divide that by ten, mod by a billion, and then call that our unique identifier. This is, as you might guess, not unique. First there's the possibility of timestamp collisions: generating two of these too close together in time would collide. Second, the math is just complete nonsense. We divide Ticks by ten (converting hundreds of nanoseconds into thousands of nanoseconds), then we mod by a billion. So every thousand seconds we loop and have a risk of collision again? Maybe, maybe, these are short-lived IDs and a thousand seconds is plenty of time. But even if that's true, none of this is a good way to do that. I suppose the saving grace is they use UtcNow and not Now, thus avoiding situations where collisions also happen because of time zones?
