    "description": "When people usually start looking for a new job, the one thing they have to be mindful of is constantly being available on their phones. You always have to be ready to take calls from hiring managers, and every phone call might start the path that leads to a serious trajectory in your life. When one gets the call that they got the job, it is usually accompanied by a lot of happy emotions, unless there is something fishy about the call, like what happened in this Reddit story. When the hiring manager called OP (original poster) to tell them they got the job, OP did not expect the manager to tell her that he needed her to start the very next day. So much so that she actually thought he was joking, which later caused her to lose the job altogether. Keep scrolling to read what happened next. After that, click here for a story of a resident who got payback at workers who kept blocking his driveway.",

    "description": "It really is something to marvel at how managers can repeatedly forget the importance of a human touch when it comes to dealing with clients. Hokey business theory and overconfidence are no match for good relationships and experience at your side. Yet, time and time again, new managers come marching on the scene, insecure about their place in their new role—maybe due to their lack of experience in the industry—overcompensating for that by making broad, sweeping changes, ignoring the pleas very staff who are enduring those changes and know they're not a good idea.This customer service representative at a company that provided software to \"major\" players in healthcare found themselves trapped and restricted by their boss's new strict \"script-only\" policy when dealing with customers, effectively preventing customer service staff from using their own experience and relationships with their clients in order to effectively manage the relationship. So, when there was a quick fix required that wasn't quick according to this new protocol, the ensuing delay caused a major issue with a major client, leading that company's CEO to come swinging in a \"Million-Dollar Client Meltdown\"",

If we could spend this whole entire day laughing at cat memes and doing nothing else, then we would be happy. And although we don't know if we'll be doing it all day, we do think that starting our day with a bunch of funny cat memes will mean starting our day on the right paw. And that is exactly why were here - to bring you all of the silly cat memes that you need to make sure that you start this day with a smile and a giggle.

We spent all of Caturday snuggled up next to our cat child, and we couldn't help but think, is it pawssible to love anything more than your own fur baby? Maternal instincts are some of the most powerful things in the world, no matter what species you are! We love wholesome videos of animals adopting other animals, like when this otter adopted an adorable orange cat, or when cats becomes best friends with their doggo siblings. But what about when a cat adopts…dinner?Della, a friendly farm cat from Ireland, had just given birth to her kittens, when three baby ducklings wandered into her birthing area. Now, normally cats and ducks are not friends, but because of the rush of heartwarming hormones that come with birth, her maternal instincts kicked in and she ended up raising the ducklings as her own.

I’ve been doing these for a few months now and I love it. Working directly with PA readers to craft something special for them has been incredibly cool. When you sign up for a commission I need you to send me all the information you can about the character you’re looking for as well as whether you want a background or not since I offer both options. I’m happy to draw characters from comics,games,movies, RPG’s or even original designs. I even drew someone’s family dog a couple months ago!  I use the site Artistree which allows us to communicate through the entire process and you’ll have multiple opportunities to give feedback and make adjustments as we work through sketches, inks and finally colors. Once we’re done I’ll send over the high res files that are suitable for printing.",

    "description": "Horror movies, as of late, have gone to great lengths to solve the key obstacle to horror movies- cell phones. When we live in a world where help is a phone call away, it's hard to imagine the characters not doing that. So screenwriters put them in situations where this is impossible: in Midsommar they isolate them in rural Sweden, in Get Out calling the police is only going to put our protagonist in more danger. But what's possibly more common is making the film a period piece- like the X/Pearl/Maxxxine trilogy, Late Night with the Devil, or Netflix's continuing series of R.L. Stine adaptations. I bring this up, because today's horror starts in 1993. A Norwegian software company launched its software product to mild acclaim. Like every company, it had its ups and downs, its successes and missteps. On the surface, it was a decent enough place to work. Over the years, the company tried to stay up to date with technology. In 1993, the major languages one might use for launching a major software product, your options are largely C or Pascal. Languages like Python existed, but weren't widely used or even supported on most systems. But the company stayed in business and needed to update their technology as time passed, which meant the program gradually grew and migrated to new languages. Which meant, by the time Niklas F joined the company, they were on C#. Even though they'd completely changed languages, the codebase still derived from the original C codebase. And that meant that the codebase had many secrets, dark corners, and places a developer should never look. Like every good horror movie protagonist, Niklas heard the \"don't go in there!\" and immediately went in there. And lurking in those shadows was the thing every developer fears the most: homebrew date handling code. /// /// /// /// /// public static DateTime LastDayInMonth(DateTime dt) { int day = 30; switch (dt.Month) { case 1: day = 31; break; case 2: if (IsLeapYear(dt)) day = 29; else day = 28; break; case 3: day = 31; break; case 4: day = 30; break; case 5: day = 31; break; case 6: day = 30; break; case 7: day = 31; break; case 8: day = 31; break; case 9: day = 30; break; case 10: day = 31; break; case 11: day = 30; break; case 12: day = 31; break; } return new DateTime(dt.Year, dt.Month, day, 0, 0, 0); } /// /// /// /// /// public static bool IsLeapYear(DateTime dt) { bool ret = (((dt.Year % 4) == 0) \u0026\u0026 ((dt.Year % 100) != 0) || ((dt.Year % 400) == 0)); return ret; } For a nice change of pace, this code isn't incorrect. Even the leap year calculation is actually correct (though my preference would be to just return the expression instead of using a local variable). But that's what makes this horror all the more insidious: there are built-in functions to handle all of this, but this code works and will likely continue to work, just sitting there, like a demon that we've made a pact with. And suddenly we realize this isn't Midsommar but Ari Aster's other hit film, Hereditary, and we're trapped being in a lineage of monsters, and can't escape our inheritance. .comment {border: none;} [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.
