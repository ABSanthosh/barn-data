    "description": "This guy taught a stranger a lesson in thorough date-planning after they refused to heed warnings about a wrong number mixup. Securing a dinner reservation on Valentine's Day wasn't this dude's top priority, but petty revenge certainly was. Valentine's Day can be a restaurant's most profitable day of the year. Desperate singles pour in, begging for tables and heavily tipping servers to impress their date. While many employees rue the day, restaurant owners count stacks of cash after a high-traffic, full house evening. That's why it's always so hard to secure a reservation on Valentine's Day—everyone wants to go out. And if you do, by some miracle, get a table at a restaurant, you better do everything in your power to keep it. To increase their chances of landing a mate, serial daters, married couples, and every long-term couple will plan ahead of time to avoid being left out in the rain, dinnerless, and romance-free. So when the guy in our next story realized a stranger was using his phone number to secure a reservation for his date on Valentine's Day, he decided to take matters into his own hands.",

    "description": "When you hate your job, it's tough to think of much else. After spending 40+ hours per week slogging in the mines of your woes, anxieties, and terrible management decisions, ripping yourself away and distancing your psyche from the workplace can be a daunting challenge. Most of us dream of doing something else with our time but justify our current employment for the sake of that much-needed paycheck. But what if money were no object? What would your dream career look like? For the first time in a long while, I love my job. However, I've had my fair share of work situations that had me contemplating a sick day every morning. For most, staying with your job is usually a question of money, but as burnt-out employees can attest, there are moments in the workplace that have us imagining an alternative reality. There are jobs out there that are simply intrinsically rewarding but not necessarily glamorous, high-paying, or making our ends meet. Sometimes, the simplicity of being a barista at a local art cafe or caring for senior dogs at a rescue center is intoxicatingly fulfilling. Keep scrolling for some other dream jobs that have nothing to do with bankrolling your lifestyle but instead your gratification levels.",

    "description": "Whew, thank Ceiling Cat that we made it through the ruffest day of the week - Meowndays. There's nothing worse than hearing your alarm go off at 7 AM after being able to sleep in all weekend, getting up in the cold weather, and leaving your cute cats home alone while you go into the office for 8+ hours. But once we make it through Meownday, everything starts to get a little easier. Then we can finally set our sights on Furiday, and then, Caturday.But our purrsuance of Furriday on Tuesday is about as useful as our cats hunting a lone piece of lint that is hiding under the couch. Futile, one might even say. However, it gives us something to look forward to; some hope that we will make it to the weekend in one piece. That's why Ceiling Cat invented funny felines in meme form, to help us get through the difficult times in the best way pawssible - laughing. So get your giggle on and get ready to pounce into Furiday because it's coming (in only 96 more hours)!",

    "description": "Cats find themselves in dubious places all the time - every cat pawrent can attest to that. But some cats find themselves in very unusual places not by choice. Unfortunately, some cats are abandoned. That's not the best thing to think about, especially for all of us cat lovers. It's not easy to think about a cat, or a kitten even, being abandoned in a remote place, for any reason (because none makes sense). But even during such a situation, the Cat Distribution System™ works its mysterious meowgic.Such a tiny kitten, only a 5-day-old one, was caught in the benevolent plan of the Cat Distribution System. Despite wandering around, alone and afraid, in the middle of a construction site - he was found by a hearty hooman who works in that exact site. The man didn't want a cat, but was definitely going to help the little floof who wandered to his construction site find a furrever home. This hearty hooman called his daughter to pick up the little goober, and so she did.After taking care of the little kitten, it didn't take long for the construction worker father to cave and keep the kitten as a new addition to the family. The daughter who scooped this teeny tiny creature told the story to the online feline family, and added a series of splendid transformation progress pictures - from a smol abandoned floof, to a meowgnificent tuxedo cat who enjoys his comfortable furrever home. The online feline family also shared other heartwarming adoption stories of several cats, who were once abandoned - but now found their furrever homes.",

I'll have to sit down for a second and really think about where the parentheses begin and end on this shit - I'm being seized 24/7 by incalculable whorls. You usually try to figure it out from the names, there's only a few total formats they use, but occasionally you don't know and you might feel compelled to ask. I feel like asking a person if they are a bot is probably worse than leaving it ambiguous; it's nice when they simply volunteer the information. I guess we also have to consider that these bots have become ensnared by carnal hungers. I'll keep an eye on it, I guess.",

    "description": "Gretchen saw this line in the front-end code for their website and freaked out: let bucket = new AWS.S3({ params: { Bucket: 'initech-logos' } }); This appeared to be creating an object to interact with an Amazon S3 bucket on the client side. Which implied that tokens for interacting with S3 were available to anyone with a web browser. Fortunately, Gretchen quickly realized that this line was commented out. They were not hosting publicly available admin credentials on their website anymore. .comment { border: none; } They used to, however, and the comments in the code made this a bit more clear: // inside an angular component: uploadImage(): void { const uniqueName = `${this.utils.generateUUID()}_${this.encrDecSrvc.getObject(AppConstants.companyID)}_${this.file.name}` /*; @note: Disable usage of aws credential, transfer flow to the backend. @note; @disable-aws-credential */ /*; AWS.config.region = 'us-east-1' let bucket = new AWS.S3({ params: { Bucket: 'initech-billinglogos' } }); */ const bucket = ( AWSBucketMask ); const params = { Bucket: 'initech-logos', Key: 'userprofilepic/' + uniqueName, ACL: \"public-read\", Body: this.file }; const self = this; bucket.upload( params, function (err, data) { if (err) { console.log(\"error while saving file on s3 server\", err); return; } self.isImageUrl = true; self.imageUrl = data.Location; self.myProfileForm.controls['ProfilePic'].setValue(self.imageUrl); self.encrDecSrvc.addObject(AppConstants.imageUrl, self.imageUrl); self.initechAPISrvc.fireImageView(true); self.saveProfileData(); self.fileUpload.clear() }, self.APISrvc ); } Boy, this makes me wonder what that AWSBucketMask object is, and what its upload function does. export class AWSBucketMask { public static async upload( option, callback, service ){ const fileReader = new FileReader( ); fileReader.onloadend = ( ( ) =\u003e { const dataURI = ( `${ fileReader.result }` ); const [ entityType, mimeType, baseType, data ] = ( dataURI.split( /[\\:\\;\\,]/ ) ); option.ContentEncoding = baseType; option.ContentType = mimeType; option.Body = data; service.awsBucketMaskUpload( option ) .subscribe( function( responseData ){ callback( null, responseData.data ); }, function( error ){ callback( error ); } ); } ); fileReader.readAsDataURL( option.Body ); } public static async deleteObject( option, callback, service ){ service.awsBucketMaskDeleteObject( option ) .subscribe( function( responseData ){ callback( null, responseData ); }, function( error ){ callback( error ); } ); } public static async deleteObjects( option, callback, service ){ service.awsBucketMaskDeleteObjects( option ) .subscribe( function( responseData ){ callback( null, responseData ); }, function( error ){ callback( error ); } ); } public static async getSignedUrl( namespace, option, callback, service ){ service.awsBucketMaskGetSignedUrl( namespace, option ) .subscribe( function( responseData ){ callback(null, responseData.data); }, function( error ){ callback( error ); } ); } } The important thing to notice here is that each of the methods here invokes a web service service.awsBucketMaskUpload, for example. Given that nothing actually checks their return values and it's all handled through callback hell, this is a clear example of async pollution- methods being marked async without understanding what async is supposed to do. But that's not the real WTF. You may notice that these calls back to the webservice are pretty thin. You see, here's the problem: originally, they just bundled the S3 into the client-side, so the client-side code could do basically anything it wanted to in S3. Adding a service to \"mask\" that behavior would have potentially meant doing a lot of refactoring, so instead they made the service just a dumb proxy. Anything you want to do on S3, the service does for you. It does no authentication. It does no authorization. It runs with the admin keys, so if you can imagine a request you want to send it, you can send it that request. But at least the client doesn't have access to the admin keys any more. This is an accounting application, so some of the things stored in S3 are confidential financial information.

    "description": "One thing I've learned by going through our reader submissions over the years is that WTFs never start with just one mistake. They're a compounding sequence of systemic failures. When we have a \"bad boss\" story, where an incompetent bully puts an equally incompetent sycophant in charge of a project, it's never just about the bad boss- it's about the system that put the bad boss in that position. For every \"Brillant\" programmer, there's a whole slew of checkpoints which should have stopped them before they went too far. With all that in mind, today we're doing a news roundup about the worst boss of them all, the avatar of Dunning-Kruger, Elon Musk. Because over the past month, a lot has happened, and there are enough software and IT related WTFs that I need to talk about them. For those who haven't been paying attention, President Trump assembled a new task force called the \"Department of Government Efficiency\", aka \"DOGE\". Like all terrible organizations, its mandate is unclear, its scope is unspecified, and its power to execute is unbounded. Now, before we get into it, we have to talk about the name. Like so much of Musk's persona, it's an unfunny joke. In this case, just a reference to Dogecoin, a meme currency based on a meme image that Musk has \"invested\" in. This is part of a pattern of unfunny jokes, like strolling around Twitter headquarters with a sink, or getting your product lines to spell S3XY. This has nothing to do with the news roundup, I just suspect that Musk's super-villain origin story was getting booed off the stage at a standup open-mic night and then he got roasted by the emcee. Everything else he's ever done has been an attempt to convince the world that he's cool and popular and funny. On of the core activities at DOGE is to be a \"woodchipper\", as Musk puts it. Agencies Musk doesn't like are just turned off, like USAID. The United States Agency for International Development handles all of the US foreign aid. Now, there's certainly room for debate over how, why, and how much aid the US provides abroad, and that's a great discussion that I wouldn't have here. But there's a very practical consideration beyond the \"should/should not\" debate: people currently depend on it. Farmers in the US depend on USAID purchasing excess crops to stabilize food prices. Abroad, people will die without the support they've been receiving. Even if you think aid should be ended entirely, simply turning off the machine while people are using it will cause massive harm. But none of this should come as a surprise, because Musk loves to promote his \"algorithm\". Calling it an \"algorithm\" is just a way to make it sound smarter than it is; what Musk's \"algorithm\" really is is a 5-step plan of bumper-sticker business speak that ranges from fatuous to incompetent, and not even the fawning coverage in the article I linked can truly disguise it. For example, step 1 is \"question every requirement\", which is obvious- of course, if you're trying to make this more efficient, you should question the requirements. As a sub-head on that, though, Musk says that requirements should be traceable directly to individuals, not departments. On one hand, this could be good for accountability, but on the other, any sufficiently complex system is going to have requirements that have to be built through collaboration, where any individual claiming the requirement is really just doing so to be a point of accountability. Step 2, also has a blindingly obvious label: \"delete any part of the process you can\". Oh, very good, why didn't I think of that! But Musk has a \"unique\" way of figuring out what parts of the process can be deleted: \"You may have to add them back later. In fact, if you do not end up adding back at least 10 percent of them, then you didn’t delete enough.\" Or, to put it less charitably: break things, and then unbreak them when you realize what you broke, if you do. We can see how this plays out in practice, because Musk played this game when he took over Twitter. And sure, it's revenue has collapsed, but we don't care about that here. What we care about are stupid IT stories, like the new owner renting a U-Haul and hiring a bunch of gig workers to manually decommission an expensive data center. Among the parts of the process Musk deleted were: Shutting down the servers in an orderly fashion Using the proper tools to uninstall the server racks Protecting the flooring which wasn't designed to roll 2,500lb server racks Not wiping the hard drives which contained user data and proprietary information Not securing that valuable data with anything more than a set of Home Depot padlocks and Apple AirTags And, shockingly, despite thinking this was successful in the moment, the resulting instability caused by just ripping a datacenter out led Musk to admit this was a mistake. So let's take a look at how this plays out with DOGE. One of the major efforts was taking over the Treasury Department's IT systems. These are systems which handle $5 trillion in payments every year. And who do we put in change? Some random wet-behind-the-ears dev with a history of racist posts on the Internet. Ostensibly, they were there to \"audit\" payments, so was their access read only? Did they have admin access? Were they actually given write access? Could they change code? Nobody is entirely certain. Even if it was only read-only, there are plenty of questions about what kind of security risk that constitutes, which means forensic analysis to understand the breach, which is being called the largest data breach in history. Part of the goal was to just stop payments, following the Muskian \"Break things first, and unbreak them if it was a mistake,\" optimization strategy. Stop paying people, and if you find out you needed to pay them, then start paying them again. Step 2 of the \"algorithm\". Speaking of payments, many people in the US depend on payments from the Social Security Administration. This organization, founded in 1935 as part of the New Deal, handles all sorts of benefits, including retirement benefits. According to Musk, it's absolutely riddled with fraud. What are his arguments? Well, for starters, he worries that SSNs are not de-duplicated- that is, the same SSN could appear multiple times in the database. Social Security Administration has, since the 1940s, been trying to argue against using SSNs as identifiers for any purpose other than Social Security. They have a history page which is a delightful read as a \"we can't say the Executive Orders and laws passed which expanded the use of SSNs into domains where they shouldn't have been used was a bad idea, but we can be real salty about it,\" document. It's passive-aggression perfected. But you and I already know you should never expect SSNs to be a key. Also, assuming the SSA systems are mainframe systems, using flat file databases, we would expect a large degree of denormalization. Seeing \"unique\" keys repeated in the dataset is normal. On the same subject, Musk has decided that people over 150 years old are collecting Social Security benefits. Now, one could assume that this kind of erroneous data pattern is fraud, or we could wonder if there's an underlying reason to the pattern. Now, I've seen a lot of discussion on the Internet about this being an epoch related thing, which is certainly possible, but I think the idea that it's related to ISO8601 is obviously false- ISO8601 is just a string representation of dates, and also was standardized well after COBOL and well after SSA started computerizing. Because the number 150 was used, some folks have noted that would be 1875, and have suspected that the date of the Metre Convention is the epoch. I can't find any evidence that any of this is true, mind you, but we're also reacting to a tweet by a notorious moron, and I have to wonder: did he maybe round off 5 years? Because 1870 is exactly 65 years before 1935- the year Social Security started, and 65 years is the retirement age where you can start collecting Social Security. Thus, the oldest date which the SSA would ever care about was 1870. Though, there's another completely un-epoch related reason why you could have Social Security accounts well older than 150 years: your benefits can continue to be paid out to your spouse and dependents after your death. If an 80 year old marries a 20 year old, and dies the next day, that 20 year old could collect benefits on that account. The key point I'm making is that \"FRAUUUDDDD!!1111!!!\" is really not the correct reaction to a system you don't understand. And while there may be many better ways to handle dates within the SSA's software, the system predates computers and has needed to maintain its ability to pay benefits for 90 years. While you could certainly make improvements, what you can't do is take a big \"algorithm\" Number 2 all over it. Which, with that in mind, the idea that these people are trying to get access to a whole slew of confidential taxpayer information is I'm sure going to go *great. There are so, so many more things that could be discussed here, but let's close with the DOGE website. Given that DOGE operates by walking into government agencies and threatening to call Elon, there are some serious concerns over transparency. Who is doing what, when, why and with what authority? The solution? Repost a bunch of tweets to a website with a .gov domain name. Which, you'd think that spinning up a website that's just that would be easy. Trivially easy. \"Security issues\" shouldn't even be part of the conversation. But in actuality, the database was unsecured and anyone could modify the site. In the end, the hacked website is really just Elon Musk's \"algorithm\" improved: instead of breaking things that are already working, you just start with a broken website.
