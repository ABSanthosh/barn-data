Thanks Ceiling Cat, we literally could not survive another day in the office. We're ready to put our paws up and get into the weekend mode with a cat in one hand and a bunch of hilarious feline funnies in the other. But you - don't you lift one tiny toe bean - we've got you covered. Because it's Furiday and we feel like celebrating, we're sending you a gift of the funniest lol-worthy cat memes a day before Caturday!These memes have been made by feline fans just like you - they're cat owners, obsessed with cats just as much as you (but not as much as us), and they know how to make us laugh with the power of cat comedy. So you can breathe easily, and rest assured that from this second on, you're in good paws. Enjoy these memes and have a great weekend!",

    "description": "Look, I get it, and I know if you're here reading this, you do too. Cats are the best. Whether it's the majestic fluffball living with you (or, let's be honest, the one you pay rent to) or a sassy stray you spotted crossing the street, cats are universal emotional support creatures. Yes, all of them. All the time. Even when a stray ignores me like I'm invisible, the snub feels oddly validating and injects a little serotonin into my day.  That being said, my cat, whom I physically gave birth to and have definitely shared more meaningful moments with than most humans, is mine. That's not negotiable. Now, imagine someone walking up to your door, skipping the small talk, and asking for your cat on the grounds that their kid needs it more than you do. That's exactly what this neighbor did.",

    "description": "Offering employees a bonus if they manage to meet a monthly or quarterly goal is a great concept, if you ask me. It gives the employees motivation to succeed, and it actually drives the company to perform better, which surely makes the higher-ups happy. As long as it helps move the company forward, it is absolutely worth it, even if it does mean the company has to spend more money on its hardworking employees.That being said, it is crucial that the given bonus is something the employees are genuinely excited about getting. It can't be an office pizza party, it has to be something that makes their hard work worthwhile. Basically, it has to be a respectable sum of money. If an employer is unwilling to commit to providing their employees with an actual bonus, they might as well give up on the whole concept. Otherwise, not only would their employees lose all their motivation, but this could genuinely drive them away, which is what is happening to the employees in the story below.",

We should be lounging clothesless by a creek eating fresh fruit and befriending woodland creatures. Why are you still looking at numbers and emails? Or prehistoric ancestors don't know what an Excel spreadsheet is, why do you have to?? Was this really the point of evolution? All of these thoughts while working are making you eepy. You might not get employee of the month, but you just might get eepiest.  But whose fault is that anyway? How dare someone email you something important to do ASAP at 3:30pm. Who do they think they are?? The rest of the work day is dedicated to thinking about how you need to honk-shoo-mee-mee-mee for a full 8 hours tonight or you will definitely not make that morning meeting. So really, managers should be encouraging midday siestas in all offices!",

    "description": "When faced with an information system lacking sufficient richness to permit its users to express all of the necessary data states, human beings will innovate. In other words, they will find creative ways to bend the system to their will, usually (but not always) inconsequentially. In the early days of information systems, even before electronic computers, we found users choosing to insert various out-of-bounds values into data fields to represent states such as \"I don't know the true value for this item\" or \"It is impossible accurately state the true value of this item because of faulty constraint being applied to the input mechanism\" or other such notions. This practice carried on into the computing age, so that now, numeric fields will often contain values of 9999 or 99999999. Taxpayer numbers will be listed as 000-00-0000 or any other repetition of the same digit or simple sequences. Requirements to enter names collected John Does. Now we also see a fair share of Disney characters. Programmers then try to make their systems idiot-proof, with the obvious and entirely predictable results.The mere fact that these inventions exist at all is entirely due to the ommission of mechanisms for the metacommentary that we all know perfectly well is sometimes necessary. But rather than provide those, it's easier to wave our hands and pretend that these unwanted states won't exist, can be ignored, can be glossed over. \"Relax\" they'll tell you. \"It probably won't ever happen.\" \"If it does happen, it won't matter.\" \"Don't lose your head over it.\" The Beast in Black certainly isn't inclined to cover up an errant sentinel. \"For that price, it had better be a genuine Louis XVI pillow from 21-January-1793.\" A La Lanterne!   Daniel D. doubled up on Error'ds for us. \"Do you need the error details? Yes, please.\"   And again with an alert notification oopsie. \"Google Analytics 4 never stops surprising us any given day with how bugged it is. I call it an \"Exclamation point undefined\". You want more info? Just Google it... Oh wait.\" I do appreciate knowing who is responsible for the various bodges we are sent. Thank you, Daniel.   \"Dark pattern or dumb pattern?\" wonders an anonymous reader. I don't think it's very dark.   Finally, Ian Campbell found a data error that doesn't look like an intentional sentinel. But I'm not sure what this number represents. It is not an integral power of 2. Says Ian, \"SendGrid has a pretty good free plan now with a daily limit of nine quadrillion seven trillion one hundred ninety-nine billion two hundred fifty-four million seven hundred forty thousand nine hundred ninety-two.\"   [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.

    "description": "You know what definitely never changes? Shipping prices. Famously static, despite all economic conditions and the same across all shipping providers. It doesn't matter where you're shipping from, or to, you know exactly what the price will be to ship that package at all times. Wait, what? You don't think that's true? It must be true, because Chris sent us this function, which calculates shipping prices, and it couldn't be wrong, could it? public double getShippingCharge(String shippingType, bool saturday, double subTot) { double shCharge = 0.00; if(shippingType.Equals(\"Ground\")) { if(subTot \u003c= 29.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 0) { shCharge = 4.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 99.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 29.99) { shCharge = 7.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 299.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 99.99) { shCharge = 9.95; } else if(subTot \u003e 299.99) { shCharge = subTot * .05; } } else if(shippingType.Equals(\"Two-Day\")) { if(subTot \u003c= 29.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 0) { shCharge = 14.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 99.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 29.99) { shCharge = 19.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 299.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 99.99) { shCharge = 29.95; } else if(subTot \u003e 299.99) { shCharge = subTot * .10; } } else if(shippingType.Equals(\"Next Day\")) { if(subTot \u003c= 29.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 0) { shCharge = 24.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 99.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 29.99) { shCharge = 34.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 299.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 99.99) { shCharge = 44.95; } else if(subTot \u003e 299.99) { shCharge = subTot * .15; } } else if(shippingType.Equals(\"Next Day a.m.\")) { if(subTot \u003c= 29.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 0) { shCharge = 29.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 99.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 29.99) { shCharge = 39.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 299.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 99.99) { shCharge = 49.95; } else if(subTot \u003e 299.99) { shCharge = subTot * .20; } } return shCharge; } Next you're going to tell me that passing the shipping types around as stringly typed data instead of enums is a mistake, too!
