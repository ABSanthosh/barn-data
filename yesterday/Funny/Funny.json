    "description": "Kittens are tiny little menaces. We love them more than life itself, but they are seriously smol engines of chaos that are simultaneously the cutest things on Earth and also your worst nightmare. They climb all over everything, run around at all hours of the night for a good 6 to 9 months… but even with all of that, you choose to keep them in your house because they are like little fluff balls with big eyes and even bigger purrsonalities. They aren't the easiest thing to live with, but they certainly do not warrant an elderly neighbor getting a restraining order against you because your kitten makes noise.Yes, you read that correctly. After this San Diego resident adopted a 3-month-old kitten, his downstairs neighbor started calling the police on him for his cat making too much noise, and even had him summoned to court (twice)! Everyone understood how absurd this was, except for the neighbor. Read through the whole kitten cat-astrophe below!Fluff. Chaos. Drama! Our weekly cat newsletter has it all -  subscribe here.",

    "description": "Having annoying neighbors is one of those universal frustrations that instantly unites strangers. Personally, I live in an old, creaky house on the bottom floor, and every time my upstairs neighbor so much as shifts in their chair, it sounds like they're rearranging furniture during an earthquake. Most of the time, I just deal with it. I pop in my headphones, crank up some music, and pretend I'm living in a trendy, intentionally noisy loft.But sometimes, no amount of noise-canceling tech can drown out the noise. If you're like me, you probably start by politely asking your neighbor to keep it down... emphasis on politely. Nobody wants to start a full-blown feud over footsteps. But when they flat-out refuse to change their ways, at that point, they're basically begging for some sweet, petty revenge.And that brings us to today's story. One guy had been dealing with his nightmare neighbor for far too long. He tried to be reasonable, but the neighbor just wouldn't listen.",

    "description": "Are all boss actually physically allergic to giving their employees a moment to rest, or is it just something that is in their nature? Where does the need to boss people around come from? (Pun not intended, surprisingly.)We understand that managers want your employees to do as much work as possible while they are on the clock, because they are quite literally being paid to be there. But sometimes, especially in fields like retail, there truly is nothing to do. Why is it so wrong for employees to just… rest? Why must they busy themselves with meaningless tasks just in case the boss comes in and sees them looking hardworking and busy?If we could have a focus group with a bunch of managers and ask them these questions, we would, just so we can listen to them attempt to logic their way out of their toxic leadership. But since we can't really do that, we might as well get a laugh out of bosses who realise their mistakes, like the one in the story below.",

I have a somewhat complex relationship with masculinity in general, which I'm sure comes as no surprise given my, you know, everything. I had to compile a custom manhood from snips of things I found on GitHub and I don't know if it would even be a durable identity for anyone else. I don't feel any particular compulsion to be a guard on the gate that winnows true men from beta cucks. I have much, much bigger fish to fry. Whatever masculinity is, though, I'm certain it doesn't involve arguing with my wife online about dolls.",

So one day I entered the bus - front display stating \"Departure in 5 minutes\". Inside I saw this (upper image)... After two minutes the numbers changed to the ones on the lower image. I'm pretty sure I was not sitting there for six hours...\"   And again with an entry we dug out of the way back bin while I was looking for more bus-related items.

    "description": "Once upon a time, there was a bank whose business relied on a mainframe. As the decades passed and the 21st century dawned, the bank's bigwigs realized they had to upgrade their frontline systems to applications built in Java and .NET, but—for myriad reasons that boiled down to cost, fear, and stubbornness—they didn't want to migrate away from the mainframe entirely. They also didn't want the new frontline systems to talk directly to the mainframe or vice-versa. So they tasked old-timer Edgar with writing some middleware. Edgar's brainchild was a Windows service that took care of receiving frontline requests, passing them to the mainframe, and sending the responses back. Edgar's middleware worked well, so well that it was largely forgotten about. It outlasted Edgar himself, who, after another solid decade of service, moved on to another company. A few years later, our submitter John F. joined the bank's C# team. By this point, the poor middleware seemed to be showing its age. A strange problem had arisen: between 8:00AM and 5:00PM, every 45 minutes or so, it would lock up and have to be restarted. Outside of those hours, there was no issue. The problem was mitigated by automatic restarts, but it continued to inflict pain and aggravation upon internal users and external customers. A true solution had to be found. Unfortunately, Edgar was long gone. The new \"owner\" of the middleware was an infrastructure team containing zero developers. Had Edgar left them any documentation? No. Source code? Sort of. Edgar had given a copy of the code to his friend Bob prior to leaving. Unfortunately, Bob's copy was a few point releases behind the version of middleware running in production. It was also in C, and there were no C developers to be found anywhere in the company. And so, the bank's bigwigs cobbled together a diverse team of experts. There were operating system people, network people, and software people ... including the new guy, John. Poor John had the unenviable task of sifting through Edgar's source code. Just as the C# key sits right next to the C key on a piano, reasoned the bigwigs, C# couldn't be that different from C. John toiled in an unfamiliar language with no build server or test environment to aid him. It should be no great surprise that he got nowhere. A senior coworker suggested that he check what Windows' Process Monitor registered when the middleware was running. John allowed a full day to pass, then looked at the results: it was now clear that the middleware was constantly creating and destroying threads. John wrote a Python script to analyze the threads, and found that most of them lived for only seconds. However, every 5 minutes, a thread was created but never destroyed. This only happened during the hours of 8:00AM to 5:00PM. At the next cross-functional team meeting behind closed doors, John finally had something of substance to report to the large group seated around the conference room table. There was still a huge mystery to solve: where were these middleware-killing threads coming from? \"Wait a minute! Wasn't Frank doing something like that?\" one of the other team members piped up. \"Frank!\" A department manager with no technical expertise, who insisted on attending every meeting regardless, darted up straight in his chair. For once, he wasn't haranguing them for their lack of progress. He resembled a wolf who'd sniffed blood in the air. \"You mean Frank from Accounting?!\" This was the corporate equivalent of an arrest warrant. Frank from Accounting was duly called forth. \"That's my program.\" Frank stood before the table, laid back and blithe despite the obvious frayed nerves of several individuals within the room. \"It queries the middleware every 5 minutes.\" They were finally getting somewhere. Galvanized, John's heart pounded. \"How?\" he asked. \"Well, it could be that the middleware is down, so first, my program opens a connection just to make sure it's working,\" Frank explained. \"If that works, it opens another connection and sends the query.\" John's confusion mirrored the multiple frowns that filled the room. He forced himself to carefully parse what he'd just heard. \"What happens to the first connection?\" \"What do you mean?\" Frank asked. \"You said your program opens two connections. What do you do with the first one?\" \"Oh! I just use that one to test whether the middleware is up.\" \"You don't need to do that!\" one of the networking experts snarled. \"For Pete's sake, take that out of your code! Don't you realize you're tanking this thing for everyone else?\" Frank's expression made clear that he was entirely oblivious to the chaos wrought by his program. Somehow, he survived the collective venting of frustration that followed within that conference room. After one small update to Frank's program, the middleware stabilized—for the time being. And while Frank became a scapegoat and villain to some, he was a hero to many, many more. After all, he single-handedly convinced the bank's bigwigs that the status quo was too precarious. They began to plan out a full migration away from mainframe, a move that would free them from their dependence upon aging, orphaned middleware. Now that the mystery had been solved, John knew where to look in Edgar's source code. The thread pool had a limit of 10, and every thread began by waiting for input. The middleware could handle bad input well enough, but it hadn't been written to handle the case of no input at all.
