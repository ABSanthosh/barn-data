    "description": "When I first talked to Grib about the new Monster Hunter, it was similar to talking to him about racing games before he actually liked cars. \"The cars look like real cars,\" he'd say. \"You drive them around on tracks and roads.\" One day later, his Hunter was Hunting some kind of octopus thing and now he's gone batshit for it. Kiko has never played one, but he's got a storehouse of skill he developed playing Bloodborne and a lot of that is gonna map. I'm comfortable saying that Monster Hunter is, itself, a genre.",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/wrap-up-your-date",
    "description": "Today, we look at a simple bit of bad code. The badness is not that they're using Oracle, though that's always bad. But it's how they're writing this PL/SQL stored function: FUNCTION CONVERT_STRING_TO_DATE --Public (p_date_string IN Varchar2, p_date_format IN Varchar2 DEFAULT c_date_format) Return Date AS BEGIN If p_date_string Is Null Then Return Null; Else Return To_Date(p_date_string, p_date_format); End If; END; -- FUNCTION CONVERT_STRING_DATE This code is a wrapper around the to_date function. The to_date function takes a string and a format and returns that format as a date. This wrapper adds two things, and the first is a null check. If the input string is null, just return null. Except that's exactly how to_date behaves anyway. The second is that it sets the default format to c_date_format. This, actually, isn't a terrible thing. If you check the docs on the function, you'll see that if you don't supply a format, it defaults to whatever is set in your internationalization settings, and Oracle recommends that you don't rely on that. On the flip side, this code is used as part of queries, not on processing input, which means that they're storing dates as strings, and relying on the application layer to send them properly formatted strings. So while their to_date wrapper isn't a terrible thing, storing dates as strings definitely is a terrible thing.

    "title": "The Sales Target",
    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/the-sales-target",
    "description": "The end of the quarter was approaching, and dark clouds were gathering in the C-suite. While they were trying to be tight lipped about it, the scuttlebutt was flowing freely. Initech had missed major sales targets, and not just by a few percentage points, but by an order of magnitude. Heads were going to roll. Except there was a problem: the master report that had kicked off this tizzy didn't seem to align with the department specific reports. For the C-suite, it was that report that was the document of record; they had been using it for years, and had great confidence in it. But something was wrong. Enter Jeff. Jeff had been hired to migrate their reports to a new system, and while this particular report had not yet been migrated, Jeff at least had familiarity, and was capable of answering the question: \"what was going on?\" Were the sales really that far off, and was everyone going to lose their jobs? Or could it possibly be that this ancient and well used report might be wrong? The core of the query was basically a series of subqueries. Each subquery followed this basic pattern: SELECT SUM(complex_subquery_A) as subtotal FROM complex_subquery_B None of this was particularly readable, mind you, and it took some digging just to get the shape of the individual queries understood. But none of the individual queries were the problem; it was the way they got stitched together: SELECT SUM(subtotal) FROM (SELECT SUM(complex_subquery_A) as subtotal FROM complex_subquery_B UNION SELECT SUM(complex_subquery_C) as subtotal FROM complex_subquery_D UNION SELECT SUM(complex_subquery_E) as subtotal FROM complex_subquery_F); The full query was filled with a longer chain of unions, but it was easy to understand what went wrong, and demonstrate it to management. The UNION operator does a set union- which means if there are any duplicate values, only one gets included in the output. So if \"Department A\" and \"Department C\" both have $1M in sales for the quarter, the total will just be $1M- not the expected $2M. The correct version of the query would use UNION ALL, which preserves duplicates. What stunned Jeff was that this report was old enough to be basically an antique, and this was the kind of business that would burn an entire forest down to find out why a single invoice was off by $0.15. It was sheer luck that this hadn't caused an explosion before- or maybe in the past it had, and someone had just written it off as a \"minor glitch\"? Unfortunately for Jeff, because the report was so important it required a huge number of approvals before the \"UNION ALL\" change could be deployed, which meant he was called upon to manually run a \"test\" version of the report containing the fix every time a C-suite executive wanted one, until the end of the following quarter, when he could finally integrate the fix.

    "description": "Office work is tedious, but when you're juggling thousands of pages of printed paperwork, it feels like sifting through an avalanche of unfilled documents. This company's executives were reminded of this feeling after ignoring the warnings of their most hardworking (and literal) department. There's something satisfying about watching a C-level boss's plans implode. Typically, they look down on the workforce, feeling empowered by their golden offices and ivory floors, but way up in their corner offices, they truly have no idea what goes on in offices that actually get the work done every day. To flex their power and prowess over their lowly employees, however, executive bosses will often make unilateral decisions that—if you're lucky—will backfire, proving the point of the 60-hour week managers downstairs. Always heed the warnings of an experienced employee, no matter how small they seem. Because if you don't, you might find yourself buried in thousands of pages of printed documents... Per your own silly request, of course.",

    "description": "A world with no HOAs would look quite different than the world we have today. Instead of those cookie-cutter cul de sacs where every lawn is pristine and all the cars are hidden inside garages, people might be more carefree with their decorating. Homeowners Associations operate as if all homeowners are slobs who only want to trash their neighborhood. They'll see someone put their trashcan outside too early and think that they're a delinquent, instead of the reality, which is probably that they just have a long list of chores to get through and are trying to be proactive. HOAs are known for handing out utterly ridiculous fines, but that's not all. Some of them also take matters further. Just ask the person who discovered that their HOA had cut down two of their trees! That's just so unacceptable, and I hope their HOA had to answer to someone for their actions. Next, read about the hardware store \"employee\" who weighed down a customer's car with no less than 30 bags of concrete: 'I started moving the bags, 2 at a time.'",

    "description": "Cats have unique ways of showing affection to their humans. Not every cat will cuddle with their human or sleep next to them in bed, but they all show their love and appreciation. You just have to understand their love language. One of the ways that cats show love is by bringing things to us. Usually, it's something small, maybe a bug that they caught or a hair tie they found. But sometimes, they things they bring are special and sweet, like the cat who brings leaves to his human. Other times, the things they bring are hilarious. Like the cat who steals undies from his neighbors then brings them to their human, or the cat who brings his owner just about anything, from fireworks, darts and pieces of wood and a cat toy that it stole from some other cat. It's an expression of love. Accept it. The cat in this video chose to bring its human just about the cutest thing that she pawssibly could have. Flowers - Camellias specifically. And she brought them consistently, covering the bed and the floors with them. She kept bringing them until her chosen human adopted her. And then… she gave that human another gift.",
