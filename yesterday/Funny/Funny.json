    "description": "Dan's co-workers like passing around TDWTF stories, mostly because seeing code worse than what they're writing makes them feel less bad about how often they end up hacking things together. One day, a co-worker told Dan: \"Hey, I think I found something for that website with the bad code stories!\" Dan's heart sank. He didn't really want to shame any of his co-workers. Fortunately, the source-control history put the blame squarely on someone who didn't work there any more, so he felt better about submitting it. This is another ASP .Net page, and this one made heavy use of GridView elements. GridView controls applied the logic of UI controls to generating a table. They had a page which contained six of these controls, defined like this: \u003casp:GridView ID=\"gvTaskMonth1\" runat=\"server\" CssClass=\"leadsGridView\" AutoGenerateColumns=\"False\" OnRowDataBound=\"gvTaskMonth1_RowDataBound\"\u003e ... asp:GridView\u003e \u003casp:GridView ID=\"gvTaskMonth2\" runat=\"server\" CssClass=\"leadsGridView\" AutoGenerateColumns=\"False\" OnRowDataBound=\"gvTaskMonth1_RowDataBound\"\u003e ... asp:GridView\u003e \u003casp:GridView ID=\"gvTaskMonth3\" runat=\"server\" CssClass=\"leadsGridView\" AutoGenerateColumns=\"False\" OnRowDataBound=\"gvTaskMonth1_RowDataBound\"\u003e ... asp:GridView\u003e The purpose of this screen was to display a roadmap of coming tasks, broken up by how many months in the future they were. The first thing that leaps out to me is that they all use the same event handler for binding data to the table, which isn't in-and-of-itself a problem, but the naming of it is certainly a recipe for confusion. Now, to bind these controls to the data, there needed to be some code in the code-behind of this view which handled that. That's where the WTF lurks: /// /// Create a roadmap for the selected client /// private void CreateRoadmap() { for (int i = 1; i \u003c 7; i++) { switch (i) { case 1: if (gvTaskMonth1.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth1, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod1.Text), \"1\"); } break; case 2: if (gvTaskMonth2.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth2, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod2.Text), \"2\"); } break; case 3: if (gvTaskMonth3.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth3, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod3.Text), \"3\"); } break; case 4: if (gvTaskMonth4.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth4, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod4.Text), \"4\"); } break; case 5: if (gvTaskMonth5.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth5, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod5.Text), \"5\"); } break; case 6: if (gvTaskMonth6.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth6, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod6.Text), \"6\"); } break; } } } Ah, the good old fashioned loop-switch sequence anti-pattern. I understand the motivation: \"I want to do the same thing for six different controls, so I should use a loop to not repeat myself,\" but then couldn't quite figure out how to do that, so they just repeated themselves, but inside of a loop. The \"fix\" was to replace all of this with something more compact: private void CreateRoadmap() { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth1, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod1.Text), \"1\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth2, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod2.Text), \"2\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth3, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod3.Text), \"3\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth4, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod4.Text), \"4\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth5, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod5.Text), \"5\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth6, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod6.Text), \"6\"); } That said, I'd recommend not trying to parse date times inside of a text box inside of this method, but that's just me. Bubbling up the inevitable FormatException that this will generate is going to be a giant nuisance. It's likely that they've got a validator somewhere, so it's probably fine- I just don't like it. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod.

    "description": "Our anonymous submitter, whom we'll call Carmen, embarked on her IT career with an up-and-coming firm that developed and managed eCommerce websites for their clients. After her new boss Russell walked her around the small office and introduced her to a handful of coworkers, he led her back to his desk to discuss her first project. Carmen brought her laptop along and sat down across from Russell, poised to take notes. Russell explained that their newest client, Sharon, taught CPR classes. She wanted her customers to be able to pay and sign up for classes online. She also wanted the ability to charge customers a fee in case they cancelled on her. \"You're gonna build a static site to handle all this,\" he said. Carmen nodded along as she typed out notes in a text file. \"Now, Sharon doesn't want to pay more than a few hundred dollars for the site,\" Russell continued, \"so we're not gonna hook up an endpoint to use a service-provided API for payments.\" Carmen glanced up from her laptop, perplexed. \"How are we gonna do it, then?\" \"Via email,\" Russell replied smoothly. \"The customer will enter their CC info into basic form fields. When they click Submit, you're gonna send all that to Sharon's business address, and also CC it to yourself for backup and recovery purposes.\" Carmen's jaw dropped. \"Just ... straight-up email raw credit card data?\" \"Yep!\" Russell replied. \"Sharon knows to expect the emails.\" Her heart racing with panic, Carmen desperately cast about for some way for this to be less awful. \"Couldn't ... couldn't we at least encrypt the CC info before we send it to her?\" \"She's not paying us for that,\" Russell dismissed. \"This'll be easier to implement, anyway! You can handle it, can't you?\" \"Yyyes—\" \"Great! Go get started, let me know if you have any more questions.\" Carmen had plenty of questions and even more misgivings, but she'd clearly be wasting her time if she tried to bring them up. There was no higher boss to appeal to, no coworkers she knew well enough who could slip an alternate suggestion into Russell's ear on her behalf. She had no choice but to swallow her good intentions and implement it exactly the way Russell wanted it. Carmen set up the copied emails to forward automatically to a special folder so that she'd never have to look at them. She cringed every time a new one came in, reflecting on how lucky Sharon and her customers were that the woman supporting her website had a conscience. And then one day, a thought came to Carmen that really scared her: in how many places, in how many unbelievable ways, was her sensitive data being treated like this? Eventually, Carmen moved on to bigger and better things. Her first project most likely rests in the hands of Russell's newest hire. We can only hope it's an honest hire.

    "description": "It's pretty ironic that bosses who make workers come into the office under the guise of \"team morale\" are themselves the reason why morale is low in the first place. Through their unfair and unthought-out polices and general management approach, the reality is that morale probably isn't actually their aim, and when they say \"morale,\" they mean \"control,\" being their control over their staff.Flexibility begets flexibility, and it's always wisest to consider all factors at play and the concessions someone else is making before criticizing them for one thing they did that you don't like…This worker, who worked on two separate teams within the same work group, had a standing agreement with their main boss that they could work from home twice a week. But, when they started splitting time with a second team, a team whose manager was also subordinate to their main boss, they began working those days from the office so that they could spend more time with the second team. But, one week they had work scheduled on their house during the week that they needed to be present for, so since they weren't working from home on any other days anyway, they decided to work from home. It seems here that they got their main boss's approval, too.Still, this triggered a passive-aggressive email from their second team's put-out manager questioning their work ethic. Disappointed and frustrated at this, the worker resolved to play the manager's game and work their office days strictly from the office, but in return, they were going to work all of their agreed-upon days from home.",

This scheduling process makes it nearly impossible to have a life outside of work and leaves you allergic to future planning. We all want to get our shifts covered when needed, but it's not cool to repeatedly pressure another colleague into taking your shift because you have plans—they can have plans, too.A perfect world would consist of everyone having all the time they need for the things they want to do, but we're not in a utopia—we are in reality! So, your best bet is to ask around your entire team to see if anyone is willing to tie up your loose ends.In this next story, an employee's coworker assumes that the employee will cover their shift without receiving a definitive yes, and goes over their head to their boss on the morning of the shift.

    "description": "Oh, cat pawrents. It was a difficult mission to catch your attention. But we understand, obviously, as cat pawrents ourselves. All we want to see, hear, smell, and give attention to - is our cat. We want to pet our cat all day, we want to hear the cat's soft purrs, we want to cuddle this floofy creature. So, yeah, it was difficult to get you all the way here, and away from your cat for a second. But your cat's asleep, so you can be for a second a general feline fanatic fan and not just of your cat.It's not like you're leaving your cat - your cat is probably still on your lap, or literally by your side. You can enjoy some cat comedy while you wait for your cat to wake up from their 16-hour nap. It's okay. We got you covered. There are plenty of comical cat memes to fill this feline time with. All you need to do is to scroll down for them.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

    "description": "Sometimes you make a mistake, but it still gets you the correct answer. Like when you do all the work in a math question, but every number along the way is wrong and you're not even doing the right thing, and yet you still got the right answer. Was it luck or are you secretly a genius and just discovered a new way to math? Most likely the luck one, because math is hard…  In the case of this itty bitty kitten, she might have gone to the wrong doctor's office, but she still ended up finding the exact kind of doctor she needed! This sick little baby waltz on into the waiting room of a human hospital clinic. She was meowing her little head off and everybody was ignoring her—except one person. A lady who was waiting patiently for her appointment. This lady, however, wasn't just any 'ole body, she was a veterinarian! She immediately recognized the cries for help and didn't hesitate to come to the rescue.  Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",
