    "description": "When living in an apartment building, you have to be okay with hearing some things your neighbors do in the middle of the day. Sure, it's annoying when you're trying to have a nap one your one day off at 2pm, but that's when your upstairs neighbor decides to vacuum—but that's just something you have to accept. If they were vacuuming at like 4am for no reason, then it's totally fine to ask them to quiet down. But if they're justing their blender to make smoothies for breakfast while you're trying to sleep in, it's unfortunate, but just something that happens. I forget the comedian who made this joke, but he said that all New Yorkers have an unwritten agreement to pretend like they don't hear each other getting freaky in bed, and as an apartment dweller in NYC, I couldn't agree more! Here, we have one neighbor taking things to a whole new petty level after she got one too many noise complaints for normal everyday activity. You see, he worked the nightshift, and she was an early riser. So when she was up at 6am, he was just going to bed. Instead of trying to compromise, they both went for throats, and now she's getting up at 6am to practice opera…",

    "description": "It's remarkable how much nonsense people think they can get away with in the name of the phrase, \"but it's my wedding!\"Here's the deal. Weddings are, of course, a special day for the happy couple, and they deserve to make certain choices based on what they want for their presumably only wedding (though the statistics say otherwise). However, you do have to keep the experience of your guests in mind. I remember a few years ago attending a wedding in which, at one point, one half of the married couple deeply considered not serving anyone food because he didn't want to pay for it. Thankfully, he was talked into giving his guests a little something, but it just goes to show that while you are entitled to make decisions that are specific to your desires, you still have to be a decent host. After all, people are traveling, spending money on air fare, organizing babysitters, and more in order to show up to your special day. You have to make it at least somewhat special for them too!",

Plus, it's an extra excuse to dress up our cats in rainbow attire to purrfectly celebrate this colorful month. Our floofy felines are proud of their two daddies and they make up our fuzzy family that we couldn't live without. That's why we've collected some of the silliest cat memes from across the whiskery wild web of cats supporting their pawrents during Pride month (in their own feline way, of course).These kitties don't care wherever you fall underneath the LGBTQ+ umbrella, they are equally as judgmental either way. They've got that funny feline flavor that we know and love from classic cat memes, but with some added rainbows and sass that comes with a bunch of gays gathered together. We hope you have a pawsitively joyful Pride and remember - your cats don't care if you're gay, they only care that you feed them on time. Enjoy!Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.

Because while we love every single cat out there, the more we learn about bobcats, the more we seem to fall for them. Bobcats are playful, and they will break into a golf course if they see a ball there that they want to play with. Bobcats are affectionate, and they will take in kittens from other families and other species and raise them as their own. Bobcats are silly and get attached to the silliest of toys, even if that toy is just… fennel. And bobcats seems to be learning… little by little, that some humans are not so bad. Now, that might not always be a good thing. Wild things are wild for a reason, and most of these cats still stay away. But some make the same calculation that house cats do… maybe sticking around humans, especially when you are in need of help or are vulnerable, like this momma bobcat who just had her kittens, is better than being in the wild.  Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.

Is Skiddle (the website in question) telling me I should come to London more often?\" They're certainly being very generous with their interpretation of dates.   But wait, there's more! Daniel follows with a variation: \"Skiddle here again - let's choose June 7th to June 14th, but Skiddle knows better and sets the dates to June 6th to June 13th.\"   \"I was not aware the Berlin to London route passes through Hawaii (which is Mokulele'shome turf)\" chuckles our old friend Michael R. He seems to believe it's an Error'd but I think the real WTF is simply the Byzantine tapestry of partnerships, resellers, rebranding, whitelabeling and masquerades in the air transport biz.   \"Maybe it's just a Monday morning thing,\" he reports from the airport.   But Monday had everybody troubled, and Michael was already thinking of Friday. \"I am so sure I took the Circle Line just last Friday. And the other lines have the option Monday-Friday/Saturday/Sunday.\" I hope there isn't a subtext here.   [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod. Restrict NuGet feed privileges with ProGet.

    "description": "One of the key points of confusion for people unfamiliar with Java is the distinction between true object types, like Integer, and \"primitive\" types, like int. This is made worse by the collection types, like ArrayList, which needs to hold a true object type, but can't hold a primitive. A generic ArrayList is valid, but ArrayList won't compile. Fortunately for everyone, Java automatically \"boxes\" types- at least since Java 5, way back in 2004- so integerList.add(5) and int n = integerList.get(0) will both work just fine. Somebody should have told that to Alice's co-worker, who spends a lot of code to do some type gymnastics that they shouldn't have: try { ps = conn.prepareStatement(SQL_GET_LOT_WORKUP_STATUSES); ps.setLong(1, _lotId); rs = ps.executeQuery(); while (rs.next()) { result.add(new Integer(rs.getInt(1))); } } finally { CloseUtil.close(ps,rs); } // instatiate a the array _workupStatuses = new int[result.size()]; // convert the integers to ints for (int h=0; h This runs a query against the database, and then iterates across the result to populate a List type with integers, and right away we're getting into confused territory. rs.getInt returns an int primitive, which they manually box with new Integer, and stuff into the List. And look, I wouldn't really call that a WTF, but it's what they do next that leaves me scratching my head. They initialize a private member, _workupStatuses to a new array of ints. Then they copy every integer from the result collection into the array, first by casting the get return value to Integer, then by pulling off the intValue. In the end, this whole dance happens because Java ResultSet types open cursors on the database side and thus don't have the capacity to tell you how many rows they returned. You need to iterate across each record until it runs out of results. That's why they populate an intermediate list. Then they can check the size and create an array, but that itself is a big why. I'm not going to say that using arrays in Java is an instant anti-pattern, but it's always something to be suspicious of, especially when you're holding result sets. It's probably a premature optimization: the key performance distance is on insertions where an ArrayList may need to resize and copy its internal backing store. My suspicion, however, is that this code falls into the category of \"C programmer forced to do Java\". They're comfortable with an array of integers, which is covers 90% of the data types you use in C but a dynamic, complicated data structure is horrifying to them. So they use it when they absolutely have to, and then throw it away as quickly as they can to get back to what they're familiar with. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.
