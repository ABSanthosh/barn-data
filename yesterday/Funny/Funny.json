    "description": "There comes a point in every relationship when you start to form your own language that anyone outside of the relationship would find, frankly, insane. Maybe it's the voice you speak to each other with. Maybe it's the pet names you call each other. Maybe it's the inside jokes you share that you wouldn't be able to explain to anyone if you tried. This stage, however strange, strengthens the relationship and forms a remarkable bond between you and your partner that you won't be able to replicate with anyone else.intelligence Some couples' language is to tease each other relentlessly, and from an outside perspective, it can seem mean-spirited. For some couples, this works. To each their own, you know. But there comes a time when you know that this stage has ended when the jokes you make about each other start to get old. One man came to the internet to talk about the jokes his girlfriend makes about him and how it escalated to the point where his coworkers started to call her out on it. So, do you think it was in their right to say something? Or is this another thing that only the couple would understand?",

    "description": "The dream of living in harmony with our neighbors is often more of a fantasy than reality. It's as if some neighbors have a secret mission to disrupt our peace, much like a villain in a comic book. They might not have superpowers, but they certainly have a knack for timing their noise-making to coincide with the most inconvenient moments. Take, for instance, the upstairs neighbor who seems to have a personal vendetta against quiet nights. They slam doors, run loud appliances at odd hours, and even resort to making noise on purpose, all in an apparent attempt to drive their downstairs neighbors mad.In today's loud story, it's clear that the upstairs neighbor is not just noisy; they're manipulative. They know exactly when to strike, often responding to even the quietest of conversations with a cacophony of slamming doors. It's a game of noise-making one-upmanship, where the stakes are your sanity and the prize is who can be the most annoying.",

Well, if you don't, we'll tell you: when one mommy kitty and one daddy kitty fall in love, they get meowrried, and then a few months later, a stork comes and drops off the kittens in a cardboard box close to where they live. Well, sometimes, the storks get lost, and they leave the kittens with some unsuspecting cat-lover (the storks are obviously employees of the cat distribution system) to take care if instead of mommy and daddy.While cooking dinner one night, this unsuspecting cat-lover went to answer the door and found nothing except a take-out box. Surprised by how heavy it was, she opened the box to find five barely born kittens, some formula, and feeding bottles. Maybe it was a stork, maybe it was a hooman who couldn't take care of them, but they were her responsibility now, and she certainly stepped up. We also included an awwdorable update, so scroll down to see all these seriously smol kittens below!",

    "description": "As someone who came into quote unquote prominence in the early Internet - and I say Quote Unquote because it was a matter of being big in a much smaller place - creative work existed within some very particular dynamics. The work we were trying to do was text and images, which the Internet of the time was adept at - it would take a little longer for people making music, video, or games to get the same opportunity. This meant that \"distribution,\" previously a very thorny concept, could be a couple badly formatted tables and an FTP client. We still managed to find abuse at the hands of various demons trying to get paid for it, but this new problem is at least a novel one and the old one was gone forever.",

Chris's predecessor decided to tackle the second one, mostly by accurately(?) naming a class: class SimpleCache { } This is, in fact, the simplest cache class I can imagine. Arguably, it's a bit too simple. Instances of this class abound in code, though no one is entirely sure why. Future optimization? Just no one understanding what they're doing? Oh right, it's that one. It's always no one understanding what they're doing.

    "description": "Andrew worked with Stuart. Stuart was one of those developers who didn't talk to anyone except to complain about how stupid management was, or how stupid the other developers were. Stuart was also the kind of person who would suddenly go on a tear, write three thousand lines of code in an evening, and then submit an pull request. He wouldn't respond to PR comments, however, and just wait until management needed the feature merged badly enough that someone said, \"just approve it so we can move on.\" .comment {border: none;} int iDisplayFlags = objectProps.DisplayInfo.BackgroundPrintFlags; bool bForceBackgroundOn = false; bool bForceBackgroundOff = false; // Can't use _displayTypeID because it will always be 21 since text displays as image if (_fileTypeID == 11) // TEXT { if ((iDisplayFlags \u0026 0x1008) != 0) // Text Background is required { bForceBackgroundOn = true; } else if ((iDisplayFlags \u0026 0x1001) != 0) // Text Background is not available { bForceBackgroundOff = true; } } else if (_displayTypeID == 21) // IMAGE { if ((iDisplayFlags \u0026 0x1200) != 0) // Image Background is required { bForceBackgroundOn = true; } else if ((iDisplayFlags \u0026 0x1040) != 0) // Image Background is not available { bForceBackgroundOff = true; } } bool useBackground = bForceBackgroundOn; // If an object does not have an Background and we try to use it, bad things happen. // So we check to see if we really have an Background, if not we don't want to try and use it if (!useBackground \u0026\u0026 objectProps.DisplayInfo.Background) { useBackground = Convert.ToBoolean(BackgroundShown); } if (bForceBackgroundOff) { useBackground = false; } This code is inside of a document viewer application. As you might gather from skimming it, the viewer will display text (as an image) or images (as an image) and may or may not display a background as part of it. This code, of course, uses a bunch of magic numbers and bitwise operators, which is always fun. We don't need any constants. It's important to note that all the other developers on the project did use enumerations and constants. The values were defined and well organized in the code- Stuart simply chose not to use them. You'll note that there's some comments and confusion about how we can't use _displayTypeID because text always displays as an image. I'm going to let Andrew explain this: The client this code exists in renders text documents to images (for reasons that aren’t relevant) when presenting them to the user. We have a multitude of filetypes that we do similar actions with, and fileTypes are user configurable. Because of this, we also keep track of the display type. This allows the user to configure a multitude of filetypes, and depending on the display type configured for the file type, we know if we can show it in our viewer. In the case of display type ‘text’ our viewer ultimately renders the text as an image. At some point in time Stuart decided that since the final product of a text document is an image, we should convert display type text over to image when referencing it in code (hence the comment ‘Can’t use display type ID’). If none of this paragraph makes any sense to you, then you’re not alone, because the second someone competent got wind of this, they thankfully nixed the idea and display type text, went back to meaning display type text (aka this goes through OUR TEXT RENDERER). What I get from that paragraph is that none of this makes sense, but it's all Stuart's fault. What makes this special is that the developer is writing code to control a binary status: \"do we show a background or not?\", but needs two booleans to handle this case. We have a bForceBackgroundOn and a bForceBackgroundOff. So, tracing through, if we're text and any of the bits 0x1008 are set in iDisplayFlags, we want the background on. Otherwise, if any of the bits 0x1001 are set, we want to force the background off. If it's an image, we do the same thing, though for 0x1200 and 0x1040 respectively. Then, we stuff bForceBackgroundOn into a different variable, useBackground. If that is false and a different property flag is set, we'll check the value of BackgroundShown- which we choose to convert to boolean which implies that it isn't a boolean, which raises its own questions, except it actually is a boolean value, and Stuart just didn't understand how to deal with a nullable boolean. Finally, after all this work, we check the bForceBackgroundOff value, and if that's true, we set useBackground to false. I'll be frank, none of this quite makes sense to me, and I can certainly imagine a world where the convoluted process of having a \"on\" and \"forceOff\" variable actually makes sense, so I'd almost think this code isn't that bad- except for this little detail, from Andrew: The final coup de grace is that all of the twisted logic for determining if the background is needed is completely unnecessary. When the call to retrieve the file to display is made, another method checks to see if the background was requested (useBackground), and performs the same logic check (albeit in a sane manner) as above. The code is confusing and unnecessary. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time. Download our guide to learn the best practice of NuGet for the Enterprise.",
