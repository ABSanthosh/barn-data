    "description": "These clueless customers just couldn't understand how they were calling the wrong number. Taking phone calls can really eat up your work day. It depends on your profession, but in some workplaces, a single call can take an hour or two per day. Whether you're assisting clients, talking to customers with urgent issues, or relaying an update to your boss, all that yapping is going to eat up your free time. Instead of doing your actual work, you find yourself dreaming about the moment you can press that \"end call\" button.No one knows that better than this person, who suddenly found themself doing nothing else but phone calls. Instead of making a couple calls, scribbling out a few emails, and then spending time on actual work, this person quite literally was stuck on the phone all day. Thanks to a mistake, they couldn't do anything else on their phone, due to getting constant calls. At least they got back at this company! These customers aren't going to renting chalets from that place any time soon. After that, read about these managers who got stuck with some awful employees and shared their stories, like one boss who shared that an employee \"thought it was perfectly okay to just take a nap.\"",

    "description": "I am thrilled to present to you the reality deniers: a fascinating breed of managers who've created their own alternate dimension where basic human needs like time off and not being on-call 24/7 are just elaborate hoaxes perpetrated by lazy employees. These truth-resistant supervisors have developed complex theories about how approved vacation time is actually a myth, and documentation is just an elaborate illusion created by the deep-workforce to undermine their authority.Their most impressive talent is their ability to completely reject observable reality. Present them with written proof of approved time off, and they'll explain how it's clearly doctored evidence. Show them timestamped documentation, and they'll launch into elaborate theories about how the scheduling system has been compromised by forces working against them. They've mastered the art of transforming irrefutable facts into debatable opinions through sheer force of denial.These managers operate in a fascinating bubble where employees exist in a quantum state of perpetual availability, and the very concept of being genuinely unreachable is dismissed as anti-corporate propaganda. They've constructed entire belief systems around the idea that workers are actually always accessible, and any evidence to the contrary is part of a vast conspiracy to disrupt their perfectly crafted schedules.",

It's Sunday, better known as Funday, and if there is one thing that you simply have to do on this meowgical day, it's stock up. It's find and keep and cherish every piece of wholesomeness and hilarity that you can get your hands on - to help you get through the week sane and safe. And for that, you have to start your day with a bunch of cat memes. That's why we bring you this collection of the best cat memes and posts directly from X every single week. Because beginning the day with a bunch of ridiculous and hissterical cat shenanigans means starting it on the right paw. It means starting it with pawsitivity. And really, it's much nicer to scroll through these posts here, not through your timeline, where you know you will get the funniest without all the drama in between.",

You just sit there, focused on how insanely cute this little creature is, and any thoughts you had before are just gone. A cat just needs to be present, not even doing anything special, for this meowgical power to work - all you need to do is look at the cat, and that's it, the meowgic works. All your focus is now on the cat. Because cats are simply that cute. This meowing magical experience works even better if you pet the cat and interact with them - because there' no blissful feeling as that of a cat giving you attention and love.To help you this Sunday, we prepared a batch of adorable cat memes to work their meowing magic on you - so you can brace for this upcoming Monday with meowing cat confidence. You might see them on Sunday morning, to have a very good mood during the day, or see them in the small hours of night, to feel better right before Monday comes.",

    "description": "We like trains here at Error'd, and you all seem to like trains too. That must be the main reason we get so many submissions about broken information systems. \"Pass,\" said Jozsef . I think that train might have crashed already.   An anonymous subscriber shared an epic tale some time ago. They explained thus. \"(I couldn't capture in the photo, but the next station after Duivendrecht was showing the time of 09:24+1.) We know Europe has pretty good trains, and even some high-speed lines. But this was the first time I boarded a time-traveling train. At first I was annoyed to be 47 minutes late. I thought I could easily walk from Amsterdam Centraal to Muiderpoort in less than the 53 minutes that this train would take. But I was relieved to know the trip to the further stations was going to be quicker, and I would arrive there even before arriving at the earlier stations.\" I think the explanation here is that this train is currently expected to arrive at Muiderport around 10:01. But it's still projected to arrive at the following stop at 9:46, and more surprisingly at the successive stops at 9:35 and 9:25.   Railfan Richard B. recently shared \"Points failure on the West Coast Main Line has disrupted the linear nature of time.\"   and quite some time ago, he also sent us this snap, singing \"That train that's bound for glory? It runs through here.\"   An unrelated David B. wonders \"When is the next train? We don't know, it's running incognito.\"   And finally, courageous Ivan got sideways underground. \"Copenhagen subway system may have fully automated trains, but their informational screens need a little manual help every now and then.\"   [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.

    "description": "There are real advantages to taking a functional programming approach to expressing problems. Well, some problems, anyway. Kevin sends us this example of elegant, beautiful functional code in C#: //create a range of dates List dates = Enumerable.Range (0, 1 + settings.EndDate.Subtract (settings.BeginDate).Days).Select (offset =\u003e settings.BeginDate.AddDays(offset)).ToList(); foreach (DateTime procDate in dates) { /*.snip.*/ } If you're not sure what this code does, it's okay- Kevin rewrote it and \"ruined\" it: DateTime procDate = settings.BeginDate; while(procDate \u003c= settings.EndDate) { /*.snip.*/ procDate= procDate.AddDays(1); } The goal of this code is simply to do something for every day within a range of dates. These two approaches vary a bit in terms of readability though. I guess the loop in the functional version isn't mutating anything, I suppose. But honestly, I'm surprised that this didn't take the extra step of using the .ForEach function (which takes a lambda and applies it to each parameter). Heck, with that approach, they could have done this whole thing in a single statement.
