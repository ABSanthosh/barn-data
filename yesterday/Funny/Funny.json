    "description": "Do you remember it, feline fam? The beginning of the internet? If you're our age (born in the late Jurassic period) or older, you certainly do. During this time, your computer made a crazy sound to connect to the internet, and cats ruled the World Wide Web. Whole sites were built around them. They ruled Tumblr, recipe blogs, and literally everything else. Thus, I Can Has Cheezburger was born. We've been trying to keep cats on top of the internet since our founding, but with each new generation, the appreciation for our feline overlords gets weaker and weaker.But, we will never stop. Even if we have to call all the cat memes we used to laugh about in our childhood as \"ancient\" or \"nostalgic,\" we will keep sharing them with the internet. The children of today have to learn about what made their memes today funny. Cat memes walked so the future could run. Maybe these memes are 100% new to you, and if so, we hope you enjoy them. If you recognize some of them, welcome back, and we hope you enjoy this blast from the past.",

Anything ranging from adopting a little feline and then finding out that this cat needs emotional support snap peas to carry around all day all the way to adopting a cat that keeps growing bigger and bigger, and suddenly finding out that you accidentally adopted a wild cat instead. This story that you are about to read falls somewhere in the middle of the madness. Honestly, at this point, we think that it is not uncommon for cats that are pregnant to look for humans to adopt. They know that very soon, they are about to be surrounded by a bunch of wiggle little kittens and that are going to need some spare babysitters around. We only wish that these cats would stop dropping their pregnancies on us as surprises. Let us know. We'll help. They don't need to hide it. But alas, they do, and we simply have to stop and appreciate their surprise as the pawsome one that it is.",

When you marry someone who has three children you might best be prepared for the eventuality that you're going to be taking care of them, either now or at some point in the future. There should at least be a point before the wedding takes place where you have that conversation, it doesn't matter that he said that he \"Isn't looking for a mom for his kids,\" as an adult around children you're going to have to take on a role of responsibility even out of sheer proximity. It's easy to get that, at 29 years old some people might not feel they're ready for that responsibility, but then you probably shouldn't be marrying someone with three children from a previous marriage.Still, they're her husband's kids and he ultimately needs to handle the responsibility of having them, which means planning in advance. If he needed to be away for the weekend he definitely should have arranged something or had the conversation with her long before the upcoming weekend…",

    "description": "Listen to your elders… Otherwise, you might end up like this guy, who had some massive fines to pay off! There are some things in life that just get worse if you ignore them, and fines are one of those things. For example, if you get your car impounded, you can just leave it there if you can't afford to get it out right away. But then you start accruing daily fees that add up to cost more and more money. Naturally, most people who get their car towed want it back ASAP, and they throw up their hands and just pay the big fine to avoid paying all those little extra fines. This dude happened to incur a fine… and then he left for quite a while. Oh no… His neighbor knew all about it, though, but he wasn't going to push the issue after the dude was impolite to him. This guy learned a very expensive lesson, which you can read all about down below. After that, read about the dude who's confronting their 25-year-old GF because she keeps bringing ChatGPT into their personal arguments: 'She needs to stop.'",

My wife Kara likes these sim style games but until now I have managed to avoid the genre. Now I’m spending all day operating my own collectible toy car store though. That by itself would probably be enough to get me but not only does your store stock blind boxes of various levels full of random toy cars (along with track and other accessories), but these cars all have stats and can be raced against customers on slot car style tracks! Here's the kicker, you can open these boxes yourself and collect the cars! After a day of playing I now have two employees who manage the cash registers all day while I sit in the corner and open blind boxes to fill out my supercar collection.  -Gabe Out",

    "description": "Now, I would argue that the event-driven lifecycle of ASP .Net WebForms is a bad way to design web applications. And it's telling that the model is basically dead; it seems my take is at best lukewarm, if not downright cold. Pete inherited code from Bob, and Bob wrote an ASP .Net WebForm many many ages ago, and it's still the company's main application. Bob may not be with the company, but his presence lingers, both in the code he wrote and the fact that he commented frequently with // bob was here Bob liked to reinvent wheels. Maybe that's why most methods he wrote were at least 500 lines long. He wrote his own localization engine, which doesn't work terribly well. What code he did write, he copy/pasted multiple times. He was fond of this pattern: if (SomeMethodReturningBoolean()) { return true; } else { return false; } Now, in a Web Form, you usually attach your events to parts of the page lifecycle by convention. Name a method Page_Load? It gets called when the load event fires. Page_PreRender? Yep- when the pre-render event fires. SomeField_MouseClick? You get it. Bob didn't, or Bob didn't like coding by naming convention. Which, I'll be frank, I also don't like coding by naming convention, but it was the paradigm Web Forms favored, it's what the documentation assumed, it's what every other developer was going to expect to see. Still, Bob had his own Bob way of doing it. In every page he'd write code like this: this.PreRender += this.RequestPagePreRender That line manually registers an event handler, which invokes the method RequestPagePreRender. And while I might object to wiring up events by convention- this is still just a convention. It's not done with any thought at all- every page has this line, even if the RequestPagePreRender method is empty. [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod.

    "description": "Mark was debugging some database querying code, and got a bit confused about what it was actually doing. Specifically, it generated a query block like this: $statement=\"declare @status int declare @msg varchar(30) exec @status=sp_doSomething 'arg1', ... select @msg=convert(varchar(10),@status) print @msg \"; $result = sybase_query ($statement, $this-\u003econnection); Run a stored procedure, capture its return value in a variable, stringify that variable and print it. The select/print must be for debugging, right? Leftover debugging code. Why else would you do something like that? if (sybase_get_last_message()!=='0') { ... } Oh no. sybase_get_last_message gets the last string printed out by a print statement. This is a pretty bonkers way to get the results of a function or procedure call back, especially when if there are any results (like a return value), they'll be in the $result return value. Now that said, reading through those functions, it's a little unclear if you can actually get the return value of a stored procedure this way. Without testing it myself (and no, I'm not doing that), we're in a world where this might actually be the best way to do this. So I'm not 100% sure where the WTF lies. In the developer? In the API designers? Sybase being TRWTF is always a pretty reliable bet. I suppose there's a reason why all those functions are listed as \"REMOVED IN PHP 7.0.0\", which was was rolled out through 2015. So at least those functions have been dead for a decade.
