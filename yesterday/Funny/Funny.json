    "description": "If you have grown up in the western world, there is one thing that you will be absolutely one hundred percent unable to deny. And that is that in some part of your heart, if not all of it, you love Santa. He represents so much good, in a world filled with so much bad, that this figure is engrained in many of our memories as a sign that if even only for a moment, everything will be ok.A great example of this being that every Home Alone movie ended at Christmas when the family came home and Kevin McCallister was found to be right as rain by his family. Even if they were going to do the same thing the following year. So we figured that we might pump up the feels by incorporating cute cats into this list of heartwarming cat memes to nourish your Santa-loving soul.",

It started with some damages caused by Hurricane Milton. As it tends to happen, many homes incurred damages after this hurricane—especially homes in the line of its destruction. Some worse than others. But, hey, that's what insurance is for, right? So, when a tree fell on a man's swimming pool enclosure, he immediately turned to his insurance—and the insurance of his neighbor's since the tree was from their yard. To work they went! When it comes to property destroyed by a tree, you call an arborist, of course! These professionals specialize in anything to do with trees. So, for the removal of this tree on his and his neighbor's property, his neighbor called an arborist in. They were assured this man was a professional and took insurance, but it turns out they needed to do a little more research…",

    "link": "https://cheezburger.com/38355461/employee-faces-backlash-after-stealing-white-elephant-gift-from-a-10-year-old-kid-at-work-holiday",
    "description": "Work holiday parties are a delicate concoction of forced holiday cheer and awkward social experiments. Case in point: the infamous White Elephant gift exchange. For those who've never played, it's a game where everyone brings a wrapped present, and the fun begins as gifts are opened, stolen, and swapped in a battle for glory—or, at least, the coolest gift under $20. Sure, seeing who ends up with what is fun (bonus points if you get to steal from the office food thief), but let's not sugarcoat it. Actually buying your gift to contribute is brutal. You're left agonizing over whether your limited budget should go toward something clever, something useful, or something just plain ridiculous. But will your coworkers think your gift is funny or just straight-up lame? Maybe we should just take a sick day instead.This office's gift exchange was gearing up to be a competitive one when a surprise guest—a 10-year-old kid—decided to join the game. Things got a little awkward with the employee's kid involved when the Original Poster (OP) walked away after stealing her coveted dragon gift. Cue a split office and a moral dilemma. But the OP was technically just following the rules. Were they in the wrong?",

    "description": "Michael had a co-worker who was new to the team. As such, there was definitely an expected ramp-up time. But this new developer got that ramp up time, and still wasn't performing. Worse, they ended up dragging down the entire team, as they'd go off, write a bunch of code, end up in a situation that they couldn't understand why nothing was working, and then beg for help. For example, this dev was tasked with adding timestamps to a set of logging messages. The logs had started as simple \"print\" debugging messages, but had grown in complexity and it was time to treat them like real logging. This stumped them, as the following C# code only ever printed out a zero: DateTime d = new DateTime(); int timestamp = d.Minute + d.Second + d.Millisecond; Console.WriteLine(timestamp + message); On one hand, this is a clear example of not understanding operator overloading- clearly, they understood that + could be used for string concatenation, but they seem to have forgotten that it could also be used for arithmetic. I don't think this actually only ever printed out a zero. It certainly didn't print out a timestamp, but it also didn't print out a zero. So not only is the code bad, but the understanding of how it's bad is also bad. It's bad. Bad. Bad. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time.
