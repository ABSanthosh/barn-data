    "description": "Oh if only Reddit were around during the days of Johnny Cash. There would be even MORE work-related drama stories on there that are probably even MORE unbelievable. But, then again, would they be able to get away with as much as they did back then if the internet existed? Probably not. Definitely not. But, for now, we have Reddit and the satisfying stories of employees defying their greedy bosses to keep us happy. Take, for instance, this guy whose manager tried to short his paycheck! He hired him with three weeks paid vacation immediately, which is unheard of in the U.S. (I know, sux). So he was stoked, but it was obvious the boss thought he was just going to quit, or it would be easy to get him to want to quit, after his job was done before ever having to cash out on those paid days off. Oh, boy, was he wrong. He messed with the wrong employee…",

It's rows and rows of books filled with knowledge and adventure are only accessible if you are in the right headspace to soak it all in. If you are there and someone is screaming into their phone about the woes of reality right next to you as you're trying to hallucinate through scribbles on some processed lumber, it's going to be very difficult. It's not easy to be transported to the wide open sea on a pirate ship or retain the facts about the human anatomy in the middle of a library if someone is next to you being noisy. That's why librarians and library attendees are constantly shushing everyone around them.  So what do you do when some tough guy entitled dude waltzing into your quiet space yelling and refusing to quiet down? This guy trying to study came up with a plan!",

    "description": "One of the things that we love most about cats, feline fam, is that they can really bring people together. We all live so much in our own worlds nowadays that it can be difficult to connect with others. However, cats are the great barrier-breakers - and this video proves it. One unsuspecting guest at a hotel was shocked to find an unaccompanied cat carrier just sitting in their hotel lobby. No pawrents around or anyone to claim the poor cat, so they started asking around. Unfortunately, they didn't have much luck and found out that the cat was abandoned there.Other guests helped them in their search, and one even offered to let it stay with them for the night while its future was being decided. Long story short, the kitty is now off to its furrever home, thanks to these wholesome hotel guests who rallied together to save this poor, scared cat. Scroll down to watch the video and read all the ameowzing comments below!",

When we think about this we get anxious, so we simply prefer to not think about this possibility ever and go to cuddle our cute cat immediately. Because how's that even possible to comprehend a life without a cat in it? We want to always have cats in our lives, in every moment. We're sure that every cat pawrent feels the same way about their fluffy feline friends.We don't want you either to think of this depressing state of not having cats in your life. On the contrary - we want you to have as many cats as you want in your life! Now, we cannot, unfortunately, bring you a cat right to your doorstep - but we can definitely increase the amount of wholesome cat memes you look at.

    "description": "Today's Anonymous submitter was reviewing some C++ code, and saw this perfectly reasonable looking pattern. class SomeClass { public: void setField(int val); int getField(); } Now, we can talk about how overuse of getters and setters is itself an antipattern (especially if they're trivial- you've just made a public variable with extra steps), but it's not wrong and there are certainly good reasons to be cautious with encapsulation. That said, because this is C++, that getField should really be declared int getField() const- appropriate for any method which doesn't cause a mutation to a class instance. Or should it? Let's look at the implementation. void SomeClass::setField(int val) { setGetField(true, val); } void SomeClass::getField() { return setGetField(false); } Wait, what? Why are we passing a boolean to a method called setGet. Why is there a method called setGet? They didn't go and make a method that both sets and gets, and decide which they're doing based on a boolean flag, did they? int SomeClass::setGetField(bool set, int val) { static int s_val = 0; if (set) { s_val = val; } return s_val; } Oh, good, they didn't just make a function that maybe sets or gets based on a boolean flag. They also made the state within that function a static field. And yes, function level statics are not scoped to an instance, so this is shared across all instances of the class. So it's not encapsulated at all, and we've blundered back into Singletons again, somehow. Our anonymous submitter had two reactions. Upon seeing this the first time, they wondered: \"WTF? This must be some kind of joke. I'm being pranked.\" But then they saw the pattern again. And again. After seeing it fifty times, they wondered: \"WTF? Who hired these developers? And can that hiring manager be fired? Out of a cannon? Into the sun?\" [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time.
