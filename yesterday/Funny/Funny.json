    "description": "\"I'm not a cat person but…\" We don't know how many times we have heard this phrase already. There is always a \"but\" coming after those words. Because cats don't care whether you're a cat person or not, if the choose you, they you will have no choice but to accept them. Dads can say they \"hate cats\" all they want, but it takes just that one kitten to change their minds. Moms can say they want nothing to do with cats all day every day, but before long, you will catch them cuddling with the felines. It's the cat's plans that matter. And that was true in this story as well. This kitten has chosen to get adopted not only by someone who is \"not a cat person\" but also by that person's two dogs, and guess what? They are all getting along purrfectly right meow - the kitten, the dogs, and the person who can no longer claim to not like cats. Yup, this happens every single time.",

    "description": "Well, this is Monday. We start a workweek like another week, and another week, and another week. It's especially hard for us, cat pawrents, to start a new workweek. We all just spent an entire weekend with our cats, such a wholesome weekend. It's a whole couple of days where every cat pawrent got to spend some serious quality time with their cats. It includes cute cat cuddles, especially in this winter weather. It also includes precious playtime, where your cat is hunting a feathered toy like the cutie patootie he is. It also includes soft snuggles, little meows, and maybe some 3 am zoomies.But we can make this Monday a little easier, and that is done with some seriously silly cat memes - we might need to go to work, but we can also enjoy some cat memes in the meantime. As we're all feline fanatic fans - more cat memes are never bad. And on a Monday, they're definitely good. So why not enjoy some now together? Let's scroll down for some feline funnies.",

There's a lot less quicksand in adult life than cartoons made it out to be. One of the things they warn you about that is really terrifying? In-laws. That's right, there's nothing scarier than meeting the people who made your partner and seeing them in their natural habitat only for you to realize, \"Oh, that explains everything.\" It's worse when your partner doesn't even realize the quirks they were endowed with are full-fledged nightmares when displayed by their parents. Some people really luck out with their in-laws, don't get me wrong. A vision of shared holidays, parents splitting time amicably when helping out with childcare. But not all of us can live a fairy tale. And if we do, it might be a Grimm one.OP here is at her wits end with her in-laws. After years of accepting their beratement and frankly bad behavior, she turns to Reddit to help her decide if she's had enough. Does her boyfriend have what it takes to acknowledge his family's shortcomings? Or will he continue the generational curse yet again?",

    "description": "Janet's company had a glut of work, and thus didn't have the staffing required to do it all. It didn't make sense to hire on any new full-time employees, so they went the route of bringing on a few highly paid consultants, specifically ones who specialized in one specific problem: talking to a piece of hardware purchased from a vendor. The hardware in question was a scientific which communicated over a serial line. This device provided a lot of data that represented decimal values, but that data was not encoded as an IEEE float. Instead, they used two integers- one for the data, and one representing the number of decimal places. So, for example, \"555.55\" would be represented as \"55555 2\". Now, in embedded devices, this isn't too unusual. It's entirely possible that the embedded CPU didn't even support true floating point operations, and this was just how they decided to work around that. When communicating over the serial line, the device didn't send the data encoded in binary, however- it did everything as text. This was arguably helpful as it meant a technician could communicate with the device directly over a terminal emulator, but it meant any software talking to the device had to parse data. Which brings us to the code written by the highly paid consultants. This code needs to take two 16-bit integers and turn them into a single decimal value. Let's see how they did it. /// /// Sets the single parameter value. /// /// Name of the parameter. /// /// public double ConvertIntToDecimal(string Value, string decimalCount) { double Result; var decimals = UInt16.Parse(decimalCount); var Val = UInt16.Parse(Value); if (decimals \u003e 0) { var divider = Math.Pow(10, decimals); Result = ((float)Val) / divider; } else { Result = Val; } return Result; } We start with comments that are just wrong, which is always a good start. The whole thing has delightfully randomized capitalization- a mix of PascalCase and camelCase. In the core logic, we parse the input values, and if there are any decimal places, we do some arithmetic to build our floating point value. We get the fun bonus inconsistency of casting to float when we handle our result in double, but at least it's a widening inconsistency, I suppose. As an overall approach to the problem, it's not a train wreck, but there's one very important thing that our highly paid consultant forgot. Our HPC, remember, was an expert in this particular instrument, or at least that was their claim. And while their mistake is an easy mistake to make while coding, it should also be an easy mistake to catch during testing, too. What was the mistake? The value is frequently negative, and they're using UInt16 to parse the inputs. Which means this function frequently threw an exception. Literally five minutes of testing would have turned it up. Janet had piles of sample data, recorded from the device, which she used for testing. Almost all of her test cases would trigger the bug at some point. It seems likely, at this juncture, that the HPC simply never actually tested the code. They wrote it. They committed it. They collected their check and left. Janet may have been the first person to actually run the code at all. In the end, hiring the HPC cost a lot of money, and maybe saved a few days of work over the course of months. It's hard to say, as it may have created more work, since so much of what the HPC did had to be debugged and often rewritten. The \"good\" news is that they have another glut of work, so management is looking to bring back the consultants for another round.
