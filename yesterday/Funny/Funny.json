    "description": "We have all been led to believe that weddings are for the couple getting married. That it is a celebration of love between two people you love. But JOKE is on the couple, because, let's be honest, the wedding is not for them. It is for the friends and family, especially, the family. Usually it's the parents that get all up in a tizzy about what they want the wedding to be like. \"Oh, well you have to invited you're aunt's best friend Mildred! She would just be heartbroken if you didn't.\" Like, \"auntie's bestie Mildred? Are you serious, mom?? The last time I saw her I was in diapers!\" And now your mom is mad at you and can't believe you would be \"so selfish.\" You can't catch a break.  The one person you think would have your back during this stressful ordeal is your sibling. Unfortunately, in the case of this Redditor, her younger brother was the main issues. Her and her fiancé decided to have a small and simple wedding that just included an elopement at city hall and the celebratory drinks near by after words—on them, of course. For some reason, the brother was mortified by this plan…",

    "description": "When you go to adopt an animal you're basically going to do a huge deed of love and care in the world. Adopting a new fluffy member to your family is, first of all, a wholesome thing to do, but most impawrtantly - a rescue. From either life in the shelter, or worse - in the streets. So setting your mind on this big responsibility is actually a noble deed, at least in our books. Most people will go for a puppy - they're cute, adorable little floofs, and it seems like everybody is adopting a puppy anyway, so why won't you?That was the exact thought of one couple who went to the local shelter - they wanted a puppy. Young, cute, and energetic. Now, it'd be a rather happy story if it ended there, with a couple adopting a precious pupper. But as we said - everybody adopts a puppy anyway… And they fell in love with someone else, who captured their hearts even though her adoption chances were far less great than those of a puppy. It happened because this one cat lady had actually chosen the couple, as many cats do. It's their inner Cat Distribution System memo.Instead of exiting the shelter with a puppy, they adopted an adult cat lady - Lily. They describe her as a \"cuddlebug lapcat\" - which was backed by picture evidence. The online feline family loved to hear about this heartwarming story, which also prompted other people to share some sweet stories about their own cats. Especially those with doggo siblings, which could've been the case with the sweet Lily of this post. Scroll below to read about this wholesome adoption story, and bask in the beauty of Lily, the cuddlebug.",

    "description": "Sammy's company \"jumped on the Ruby on Rails bandwagon since there was one on which to jump\", and are still very much a Rails shop. The company has been around for thirty years, and in that time has seen plenty of ups and downs. During one of those \"ups\", management decided they needed to scale up, both in terms of staffing and in terms of client base- so they hired an offshore team to promote international business and add to their staffing. A \"down\" followed not long after, and the offshore team was disbanded. So Sammy inherited the code. I know I'm generally negative on ORM systems, and that includes Rails, but I want to stress: they're fine if you stay on the happy path. If your data access patterns are simple (which most applications are just basic CRUD!) there's nothing wrong with using an ORM. But if you're doing that, you need to use the ORM. Which is not what the offshore team did. For example: class Request \u003c ActiveRecord::Base def self.get_this_years_request_ids(facility_id) # There are several other methods that are *exactly* the same, except for the year requests = Request.where(\"requests.id in (select t.id from requests as t # what is the purpose of this subquery? where t.unit_id=token_requests.unit_id and t.facility_id=token_requests.facility_id and t.survey_type = '#{TokenRequest::SURVEY_TYPE}' # why is SURVEY_TYPE a constant? and EXTRACT( YEAR FROM created_at) = EXTRACT(YEAR FROM current_timestamp) order by t.id desc) and token_requests.facility_id = #{facility_id.to_i} # so we get all the requests by year, then by by ??? and token_requests.survey_type = '#{Request::SURVEY_TYPE}'\") Comments from Sammy. Now, if we just look at the signature of the method, it seems like this should be a pretty straightforward query: get all of the request IDs for a given facility ID, within a certain time range. And Sammy has helpfully provided a version of this code which does the same thing, but in a more \"using the tools correctly\" way: def self.request_ids_for_year(facility_id,year = Time.now.year) token_requests = TokenRequest.where( :facility_id=\u003efacility_id, :survey_type=\u003eTokenRequest::SURVEY_TYPE, :created_at=\u003e(DateTime.new(year.to_i).beginning_of_year .. DateTime.new(year.to_i).end_of_year)) Now, I don't know Ruby well enough to be sure, but the DateTime.new(year.to_i) whiffs a bit of some clumsy date handling, but that may be a perfectly cromulent idiom in Ruby. But this code is pretty clear about what it's doing: finding request objects for a given facility within a given year. Why one uses Request and the other uses TokenRequest is a mystery to me- I' m going to suspect some bad normalization in the database or errors in how Sammy anonymized the code. That's neither here nor there. Once we've gotten our list of requests, we need to process them to output them. Here's how the offshore code converted the list into a comma delimited string, wrapped in parentheses. string_token_request_ids = \"(-1)\" if token_requests \u0026\u0026 token_requests.length \u003e 0 for token_request in token_requests if string_token_request_ids != \"\" string_token_request_ids = string_token_request_ids + \",\" end string_token_request_ids = string_token_request_ids + token_request.id.to_s end string_token_request_ids = \"(\" + string_token_request_ids + \")\" end end end Look, if the problem is to \"join a string with delimiters\" and you write code that looks like this, just delete your hard drive and start over. You need extra help. We start by defaulting to (-1) which is presumably a \"no results\" indicator. But if we have results, we'll iterate across those results. If our result string is non-empty (which it definitely is non-empty), we append a comma (giving us (-1),). Then we append the current token ID, giving us (-1),5, for example. Once we've exhausted all the returned IDs, we wrap the whole thing in parentheses. So, this code is wrong- it's only supposed to return (-1) when there are no results, but as written, it embeds that in the results. Presumably the consuming code is able to handle that error gracefully, since the entire project works. Sammy provides us a more idiomatic (and readable) version of the code which also works correctly: return \"(#{token_requests.count \u003e 0 ? token_requests.map(\u0026:id).join(',') : '(-1)'})\" I'll be honest, I hate the fact that this is returning a stringly-typed list of integers, but since I don't know the context, I'll let that slide. At the very least, this is a better example of what joining a list of values into a string should look like. Sammy writes: It seems these devs never took the time to learn the language. After asking around a bit, I found out they all came from a Java background. Most of this code seems to be from a VB playbook, though. That's a huge and undeserved insult to Visual Basic programmers, Sammy. Even they're not that bad. .comment{border:none;} [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands. Download today!",
