    "description": "This person would've been in huge trouble if their boss hadn't signed 2 little letters on a piece of paper! The longer you're in the workforce, the more you learn to CYA. Always document things in writing, especially if it's something you strongly disagree with. That way, when your boss gets upset that you did or didn't do something, you can point them to the email you sent them, or the Slack message you sent, complete with time stamps. Not to mention that just the phrase \"Can you send me that in writing?\" is enough to stop most managers in their tracks. It begs the question, \"Why do you need that in writing?\" and the answer is, well, it's probably because that manager is requesting something so dim-witted that it needs recording. No one wants to look uninformed in the workplace, especially not when it's properly recorded by a diligent employee. This boss made a giant mistake, and lost his job over placing his initials on the wrong thing. It's a tough lesson for him to learn, but it was a very costly mistake that could've been easily avoided if he wasn't so full of hubris. Next, read about the scorned stay-at-home mom whose husband didn't invite her to a work event: 'I ran into the CEO's wife... she confirmed she was there.'",

    "description": "If you've ever looked at moving away from your hometown family, you'll hear a lot from your relatives about how it's going to be harder living somewhere away from them and without the \"family support system.\" Those who are of an age where they might be considering having children will hear a lot of this. Particularly from expectant would-be grandparents who don't want their grandchildren growing up somewhere away from them.While this might seem like a scam to keep you nearby, they have a legitimate point. It really is a lot harder when you're living somewhere without close family nearby, and it's important to remember here that as soon as kids enter the picture, the phrase \"family support system\" really means one thing: free child care. (Story continues below)This is something people tend to take for granted when they have it. Like this older sister did in a story shared by her younger sister to this popular online community. See, it's really hard to convince people to look after your children, even if they are of your own flesh and family.",

Over here, things are already looking up. The weather is as delightful as our favorite whiskered companions, and we know better than to take this kind of springtime sunshine for granted. We're determined to soak it all in while it lasts. The only question is how.If we're being honest, we'll probably do what we always do. Stay cozied up indoors, sipping something warm, admiring the sunshine from the comfort of the couch. Naturally, our cat Sushi will be right there with us, curled up like a little loaf of drama. Sushi, our tuxedo-coated chaos gremlin, is a master of lounging and a full-time windowsill philosopher. His favorite pastime is bird watching. We don't really get the appeal, but he seems to think it's top-tier entertainment. We're convinced he's watching secret bird meetings or feathery soap operas unfold in the trees. Whatever it is, he's fully invested.",

    "description": "It's Meownday, feline fam, and we're already confused. Our questionable query is this: why does helping someone cost so much money? Shouldn't there be some sort of charity discount? We think that should be a thing. Anyway, we digress. It's just a shame that so many people go out of their way, spend thousands of their own dollars on saving animals in need, and get nothing back except for the good, fuzzy feelings in their hearts. Don't get us wrong, that's great, but maybe it should cost less to save a life in need.When the young mom in this post rescued two stray kittens, she posted about needing help to get them fixed. She specifically stated that she couldn't afford it, so when a local rescue came forward and offered to help, she assumed it would be for free. Well, fast forward a bit, and she gets a bill for her \"free\" help. Hence, why we think the charity discount should be a thing. Anyway, scroll down to read the full story below!",

    "description": "Legacy systems are hard to change, and even harder to eliminate. You can't simply do nothing though; as technology and user expectations change, you need to find ways to modernize and adapt the legacy system. That's what happened to Alicia's team. They had a gigantic, spaghetti-coded, monolithic application that was well past drinking age and had a front-end to match. Someone decided that they couldn't touch the complex business logic, but what they could do was replace the frontend code by creating an adapter service; the front end would call into this adapter, and the adapter would execute the appropriate methods in the backend. Some clever coder named this \"Backend for Frontend\" or \"BFF\". It was not anyone's BFF. For starters, this system didn't actually allow you to just connect a UI to the backend. No, that'd be too easy. This system was actually a UI generator. The way this works is that you feed it a schema file, written in JSON. This file specifies what input elements you want, some hints for layout, what validation you want the UI to perform, and even what CSS classes you want. Then you compile this as part of a gigantic .NET application, and deploy it, and then you can see your new UI. No one likes using it. No one is happy that it exists. Everyone wishes that they could just write frontends like normal people, and not use this awkward schema language. All that is to say, when Alicia's co-worker stood up shortly before lunch, said, \"I'm taking off the rest of the day, BFF has broken me,\" it wasn't particularly shocking to hear- or even the first time that'd happened. Alicia, not heeding the warning inherent in that statement, immediately tracked down that dev's last work, and tried to understand what had been so painful. \"minValue\": 1900, \"maxValue\": 99, This, of course, had to be a bug. Didn't it? How could the maxValue be lower than the minValue? Let's look at the surrounding context. { \"type\": \"eventValueBetweenValuesValidator\", \"eventType\": \"CalendarYear\", \"minValue\": 1900, \"maxValue\": 99, \"isCalendarBasedMaxValue\": true, \"message\": \"CalendarYear must be between {% raw %}{{minValue}}{% endraw %} and {% raw %}{{maxValue}}{% endraw %}.\" } I think this should make it perfectly clear what's happening. Oh, it doesn't? Look at the isCalendarBasedMaxValue field. It's true. There, that should explain everything. No, it doesn't? You're just more confused? The isCalendarBasedMaxValue says that the maxValue field should not be treated as a literal value, but instead, is the number of years in the future relative to the current year which are considered valid. This schema definition says \"accept all years between 1900 and 2124 (at the time of this writing).\" Next year, that top value goes up to 2125. Then 2126. And so on. As features go, it's not a terrible feature. But the implementation of the feature is incredibly counter-intuitive. At the end of the day, this is just bad naming: (ab)using min/max to do something that isn't really a min/max validation is the big issue here. Alicia writes: I couldn't come up with something more counterintuitive if I tried. Oh, don't sell yourself short, Alicia. I'm sure you could write something far, far worse if you tried. The key thing here is that clearly, nobody tried- they just sorta let things happen and definitely didn't think too hard about it. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.

For those few (everyone) who didn't catch the off-by-one from last week's batch, there's the clue. \"Gotta CAPTCHA 'Em All,\" puns Alex G. \"So do I select them all?\" he wondered. I think the correct answer is null.   \"What does a null eat?\" wondered B.J.H , \"and is one null invited or five?\". The first question is easily answered. NaaN, of course. Probably garlic. I would expect B.J. to already know the eating habits of a long-standing companion, so I am guessing that the whole family is not meant to tag along. Stick with just the one.   Planespotter Rick R. caught this one at the airport. \"Watching my daughter's flight from New York and got surprised by Boeing's new supersonic 737 having already arrived in DFW,\" he observed. I'm not quite sure what went wrong. It's not the most obvious time zone mistake I can imagine, but I'm pretty sure the cure is the same: all times displayed in any context that is not purely restricted to a single location (and short time frame) should explicitly include the relevant timezone.   Rob H. figures \"From my day job's MECM Software Center. It appears that autocorrect has miscalculated, because the internet cannot be calculated.\" The internet is -1.   Ending this week on a note of hope, global warrior Stewart may have just saved the planet. \"Climate change is solved. We just need to replicate the 19 March performance of my new solar panels.\" Or perhaps I miscalculated.   [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.
