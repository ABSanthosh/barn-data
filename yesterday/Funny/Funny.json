    "description": "Administrators hold your entire life in their hands. Literally and sort of figuratively, these click-clacking keyboard surfers have the entire company at their fingertips, controlling employee availability, PTO requests, and most importantly, calendar scheduling. Anyone with an ounce of self-preservation in the office would treat their receptionists and other admin folk with the utmost respect, because at the end of each workday, they are powerful enough to pull the strings and find every opportunistic scheduling loophole. However, this hot-headed manager just had to be the king of the office, belittling the administration staff to bolster his own company image. But after CCing the entire company on a rage-fueled email to make himself look better than the admin scheduler, he quickly realized he'd just thrown his entire team's priority out the window.",

You can be the CEO of a successful company where all you're paid to do is sit at a desk and pretend to work, and you would still hate the middle of the week. The sound of the word \"Wednesday\" makes me wince. As you can see, I feel very strongly about the middle of the workweek. What's worse is that the weekend lasts for 0.5 seconds before we're back to the beginning of the workweek again. The cycle never ends, the grind never stops. At least we have memes to laugh through the pain!If you're feeling woeful on this wonderful Wednesday, then consider scrolling below. You might crack a smile for the first time today! Hey—I won't tell anyone.",

We have heard of neighbors abandoning their cats and leaving them to fend for themselves, which is bad enough, but apparently, it's not even the tip of the iceberg. We have heard of neighbors stealing people's cats knowing that the cats belong to someone else. We have heard of entitled neighbors demanding people give their cats to them because they need the cat more. And today, we come across one of the most entitled neighbors yet. It's been a year since their cat has gone \"missing\", a year since their neighbor found the cat, rescued it, attempted to find its owners and been told by the vet that the cat is in such poor condition, there is no way it belonged to someone else. A year, and suddenly, these neighbors remember that they had a cat, start asking around about it, and once they find it, demand to get it back. The audacity is baffling.",

    "description": "If you're a cat pawrent, you know your cat has their routine. And honestly, every household with a cat in it is managed by the cat's schedule. That's just part of being a cat pawrent, there's nothing bad about it. Your cat decides you should get up at a specific time? Well, good morning then, because the cat has probably woken you up. Your cat is sure now it's dinner time? Bon appetit, because the cat won't stop meowing until dinner is served. Such are the lives of cat pawrents.But when your cat's routine is broken, cat pawrents get stressed. Oh, the woes of being a cat pawrent. But seriously, knowing your cat has a strict schedule and then, suddenly, it changes - it might raise some red flags. This is exactly what happened to a pair of parents who raise a cute tuxie cat. Their cat used to sleep in bed with them every night, even after they had kids. But at some point, the cat stopped sleeping in their bed. Routine change? That's suspicious. Especially because cats will be cats, meaning routine-oriented.The parents who are also pawrents investigated. But the investigation results were not as stressful as a cat changing their routine. The results were actually very, very cute. Apparently, the cat moved from one bed to another - from the parents' bed, to their toddler's bed. The cat decided that his sleeping place has changed now, and reality just has to comply. But the process of adjusting wasn't met with any objections - on the contrary, the kid embraced the idea, by embracing the cat and cuddling him to sleep.It was all caught on the security camera in the kid's room. Once shared, the online feline family collectively melted with how adorable this is. The wholesome comments came, describing hearts melting with cuteness. Some even shared their own cat cuddling stories, with cats and humans sleeping together at night. Honestly, our hearts have melted as well.",

It's essentially a kind of intellectual pose, an inoculation against new information, the implementation of a kind of mental hygiene. At some level I think that dogmas exist to control the biological costs of cognition, but we don't have to trek all the way out there. It's not any more complex than this: people we don't like will sometimes be correct. Because we live in a world largely made of information now, we can curate ourselves utterly out of any functional mode of self-correction. It hasn't made us any smarter, and when we become aware of just how thoroughly we have invested ourselves in illusion it falls on you like a guillotine.",

    "description": "Andre has inherited a rather antique ASP .Net WebForms application. It's a large one, with many pages in it, but they all follow a certain pattern. Let's see if you can spot it. protected void btnSearch_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { ArrayList paramsRel = new ArrayList(); paramsRel[\"Name\"] = txtNome.Text; paramsRel[\"Date\"] = txtDate.Text; Session[\"paramsRel\"] = paramsRel; List clients = Controller.FindClients(); //Some other code } Now, at first glance, this doesn't look terrible. Using an ArrayList as a dictionary and frankly, storing a dictionary in the Session object is weird, but it's not an automatic red flag. But wait, why is it called paramsRel? They couldn't be… no, they wouldn't… public List FindClients() { ArrayList paramsRel = (ArrayList)Session[\"paramsRel\"]; string name = (string)paramsRel[\"Name\"]; string dateStr = (string)paramsRel[\"Date\"]; DateTime date = DateTime.Parse(dateStr); //More code... } Now there's the red flag. paramsRel is how they pass parameters to functions. They stuff it into the Session, then call a function which retrieves it from that Session. This pattern is used everywhere in the application. You can see that there's a vague gesture in the direction of trying to implement some kind of Model-View-Controller pattern (as FindClients is a member of the Controller object), but that modularization gets undercut by everything depending on Session as a pseudoglobal for passing state information around. The only good news is that the Session object is synchronized so there's no thread safety issue here, though not for want of trying. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.

    "description": "Frequently in programming, we can make a tradeoff: use less (or more) CPU in exchange for using more (or less) memory. Lookup tables are a great example: use a big pile of memory to turn complicated calculations into O(1) operations. So, for example, implementing itoa, the C library function for turning an integer into a character array (aka, a string), you could maybe make it more efficient using a lookup table. I say \"maybe\", because Helen inherited some C code that, well, even if it were more efficient, it doesn't help because it's wrong. Let's start with the lookup table: char an[1000][3] = { {'0','0','0'},{'0','0','1'},{'0','0','2'},{'0','0','3'},{'0','0','4'},{'0','0','5'},{'0','0','6'},{'0','0','7'},{'0','0','8'},{'0','0','9'}, {'0','1','0'},{'0','1','1'},{'0','1','2'},{'0','1','3'},{'0','1','4'},{'0','1','5'},{'0','1','6'},{'0','1','7'},{'0','1','8'},{'0','1','9'}, … I'm abbreviating the lookup table for now. This lookup table is meant to be use to convert every number from 0…999 into a string representation. Let's take a look at how it's used. int ll = f-\u003ecfg.len_len; long dl = f-\u003edata_len; // Prepare length if ( NULL == dst ) { dst_len = f-\u003edata_len + ll + 1 ; dst = (char*) malloc ( dst_len ); } else //if( dst_len \u003c ll + dl ) if( dst_len \u003c (unsigned) (ll + dl) ) { // TO DOO - error should be processed break; } long i2; switch ( f-\u003ecfg.len_fmt) { case ASCII_FORM: { if ( ll \u003c 2 ) { dst[0]=an[dl][2]; } else if ( ll \u003c 3 ) { dst[0]=an[dl][1]; dst[1]=an[dl][2]; } else if ( ll \u003c 4 ) { dst[0]=an[dl][0]; dst[1]=an[dl][1]; dst[2]=an[dl][2]; } else if ( ll \u003c 5 ) { i2 = dl / 1000; dst[0]=an[i2][2]; i2 = dl % 1000; dst[3]=an[i2][2]; dst[2]=an[i2][1]; dst[1]=an[i2][0]; } else if ( ll \u003c 6 ) { i2 = dl / 1000; dst[0]=an[i2][1]; dst[1]=an[i2][2]; i2 = dl % 1000; dst[4]=an[i2][2]; dst[3]=an[i2][1]; dst[2]=an[i2][0]; } else { // General case for ( int k = ll ; k \u003e 0 ; k-- ) { dst[k-1] ='0' + dl % 10; dl/=10; } } dst[dl]=0; break; } } Okay, we start with some reasonable bounds checking. I have no idea what to make of a struct member called len_len- the length of the length? I'm lacking some context here. Then we get into the switch statement. For all values less than 4 digits, everything makes sense, more or less. I'm not sure what the point of using a 2D array for you lookup table is if you're also copying one character at a time, but for such a small number of copies I'm sure it's fine. But then we get into the len_lens longer than 3, and we start dividing by 1000 so that our lookup table continues to work. Which, again, I guess is fine, but I'm still left wondering why we're doing this, why this specific chain of optimizations is what we need to do. And frankly, why we couldn't just use itoa or a similar library function which already does this and is probably more optimized than anything I'm going to write. When we have an output longer than 5 characters, we just use a naive for-loop and some modulus as our \"general\" case. So no, I don't like this code. It reeks of premature optimization, and it also has the vibe of someone starting to optimize without fully understanding the problem they were optimizing, and trying to change course midstream without changing their solution. But there's a punchline to all of this. Because, you see, I skipped most of the lookup table. Would you like to see how it ends? Of course you do: {'9','8','0'},{'9','8','1'},{'9','8','2'},{'9','8','3'},{'9','8','4'},{'9','8','5'},{'9','8','6'},{'9','8','7'},{'9','8','8'},{'9','8','9'} }; The lookup table doesn't work for values from 990 to 999. There are just no entries there. All this effort to optimize converting integers to text and we end up here: with a function that doesn't work for 1% of the possible values it could receive. And, given that the result is an out-of-bounds array access, it fails with everyone's favorite problem: undefined behavior. Usually it'll segfault, but who knows! Maybe it returns whatever bytes it finds? Maybe it sends the nasal demons after you. The compiler is allowed to do anything.
