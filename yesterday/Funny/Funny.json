    "description": "There are so many stereotypes about cats, and more specifically, about senior cats. Did you know that people adopt senior cats so rarely, even a one-year-old cat is considered \"too old to adopt\" in some shelters? People don't understand that senior cats make amazing pets. Oftentimes, cats get more affectionate with age. They understand better how to appreciate the things that they have, especially if they get adopted older. But people just want itty bitty kittens. Which is cool and understandable, and we don't judge people for loving kittens. We just wish that more people gave senior cats a chance, and beyond that - that more people didn't stop giving their senior cats less attention than they gave them when they were younger. Because it's important to pay attention. It's important because it means that you will be able to spot things like this - when you cat suddenly starts behaving completely differently, and instead of being the affectionate little fluffball that it used to be when it was younger, it becomes \"grumpy\" at everyone and everything.",

We know you're like us, we can smell the feline fanatic fans through the screen, like cats with a very good sense of smell. But that's okay, you're in good company here, because we're all the same as you - one step away from becoming crazy cat ladies. So, \"crazy\" is in the name, yeah? So we ignore Mondays. Instead of a regular office Monday, we party with all the office cats like it's still the weekend.We know not everyone can do the same, but we want to share this healthy practice with all you feline fanatic fans. So we gathered some cat memes that portray the pawrecious party of ignoring Monday. It really feels like a feline-filled weekend instead. You should try it, these cat memes are silly enough for you to feel as if it's still the weekend. P-p-p-p-p-pawrty 'till we drop.",

    "description": "Workplace leaders often have a weird talent for caring way too much about tiny things while ignoring big problems. Managers will throw fits over dress codes, monitor your bathroom breaks, or ban personal items at desks, all while turning a blind eye to stolen wages, safety issues, or employees drowning in burnout.It's like watching someone whine about a spilled coffee stain while their house burns down behind them.  These bosses are never ready for the shocking instances when their petty rules blow up in their faces.Take disability accommodations, for example. Ask for a stool because standing hurts? Not without a 10-page doctor's note. Need a quiet workspace for anxiety? You should consider being less sensitive.Our front desk rock star learned this firsthand. They used a simple bell as a disability aid, approved by old management. New bosses decided bells were forbidden, threatening punishment if it rang again. When our hero explained it was helpful, the manager demanded private health details. If this sounds illegal to use, it's probably because it very much is.",

    "description": "Taking credit for someone else's work almost always backfires. It's simply not worth the risk. Most people learn this in middle school during their first big group project. Personally speaking, I was unsurprisingly the type of person who took on the majority of work during group projects, for better or for worse. Sometimes, it wasn't even about slackers in the group. It was often coming from a place of not wanting to inconvenience others by making them put in their fair share of effort. Perhaps it was also coming from a lack of trust in the abilities of my fellow classmates. Either way, it wasn't a good look. Still, at the very least, I would never allow someone to take full credit for my work. Even in middle school, I would draw the line there. Clearly, some entitled people grow up without having considered the consequences of passing off someone else's work as their own…",

    "description": "Just because you get fired doesn't mean that your pull requests are automatically closed. Dallin was in the middle of reviewing a PR by Steve when the email came out announcing that Steve no longer worked at the company. Let's take a look at that PR, and maybe we can see why. $originalUndrawn = DecimalHelper::toDecimal($party-\u003elimit)-\u003esub(DecimalHelper::toDecimal($party-\u003edrawn)); This is the original code, which represents operations on investments. An investment is represented by a note, and belongs to one or more partys. The amount that can be drawn is set by a limit, which can belong to either the party or the note. What our developer was tasked with doing was allow a note to have no limit. This means changing all the places where the note's limit is checked. So this is what they submitted: if ($note-\u003elimit == null) { $originalUndrawn = DecimalHelper::toDecimal($party-\u003elimit)-\u003esub(DecimalHelper::toDecimal($party-\u003edrawn)); } else { $originalUndrawn = DecimalHelper::toDecimal($party-\u003elimit)-\u003esub(DecimalHelper::toDecimal($party-\u003edrawn)); } You'll note here that the note limit isn't part of calculating the party limits, so both branches do the same thing. And then there's the deeper question of \"is a null really the best way to represent this?\" especially given that elsewhere in the code they have an \"unlimited\" flag that disables limit checking. Now, Steve wasn't let go only for their code- they were just a miserable co-worker who liked to pick fights in pull request comments. So the real highlight of Steve's dismissal was that Dallin got to have a meaningful discussion about the best way to make this change with the rest of the team, and Steve didn't have a chance to disrupt it.
