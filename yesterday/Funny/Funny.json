    "description": "Everyone wishes some kind of comeuppance for that one teacher who gave them a rough time in high school. Perhaps you hope someone calls them out, or they get fired, or they slip on a banana peel in the cafeteria. No one could dream up this perfect confluence of events.This student, who was now over ten years out of school, was still haunted by the treatment she received from one of her former teachers: Ms. Samantha. Ms. Samantha was an unkind excuse of a \"professor\" whose words had a long-term impact on this author and their educational future. Years after the damage was done, the author was visiting home and was taking a long walk in the park. That's when a chance encounter with a skunk and another chance encounter with Ms. Samantha herself gave the author the perfect plan. Keep scrolling below for her full account of the tense exchange with Ms. Samantha!",

    "description": "Some people prefer the big city life to small town living, and that's fine. The accessibility to public transportation, the people watching, the endless things to do, etc. It's a faster pace of life and some people thrive in that environment. However, some people are the complete opposite and thrive in places that are slower. That is when small town/country life is embraced! People who are like this go out to find a secluded plot of land for themselves where they can live in peace and solitude and only see people when they so choose to. In the city, the second you step outside of your door, you are likely to encounter another person. In the country, you're more likely to encounter a woodland creature before anyone else—and that's how they like it! Both have their negatives and positives.  However, if you are a visitor in either of those places, you know to respect the rules of the area. That means, reading the signs that tell you what you can or cannot do around town. Like, perhaps, \"private property\" and \"do not enter\" signs. They have those everywhere, it's not like you don't understand what they mean…",

    "description": "You know the saying that's been going around now - he's not the step-dad, he's the dad who stepped up. Well, this is the momma version of that. We love seeing videos of animals adopting babies that aren't theirs. Like when this sweet dog adopted a tiny orange kitten, or this cat adopting an otter to grow up into being besties. It just goes to show that we, as hoomans, still have a lot to learn from our animal friends. In this purrticular case, however, the story is about a momma cat who was surrendered without her babies and saved a litter of neonatal kittens by being their mom.Without her, these kittens might not have survived. Sure, she may have been crucial to their survival, but we also think that they saved her a little bit, too. Sometimes, you just need a reason to keep on going, and these kittens were that for her. It's purrfectly adorable and meowgnificently heartwarming to see, so scroll down and watch this wholesome story below!",

    "description": "Hello, cat pawrents. Do you enjoy your weekend so far? And what about your cat - does your cat enjoy having you all for themselves on the weekend? Because if we know cats, which we do, we think they'd want you to sass up your Sunday and have an extremely silly and cat-filled weekend. To sass up your Sunday and fill it with cats, you need to surround yourself with as many cats as pspspssible. The more cats you have around you - the more sass your Sunday will catch, creating a sassy weekend vibe for you. Just as your cat intends.Now, we know you might not be a crazy cat lady with 20 cats to meet the Sunday sass demand - and that's okay. Not everyone can be a successful crazy cat lady. But you can do another thing that's also a solution for meeting your cat's demands for sass - and that is with sassy Sunday cat memes. They're best for cat pawrents sassing out their Sunday for their cats.",

    "description": "Today's Anonymous submitter was reviewing some C++ code, and saw this perfectly reasonable looking pattern. class SomeClass { public: void setField(int val); int getField(); } Now, we can talk about how overuse of getters and setters is itself an antipattern (especially if they're trivial- you've just made a public variable with extra steps), but it's not wrong and there are certainly good reasons to be cautious with encapsulation. That said, because this is C++, that getField should really be declared int getField() const- appropriate for any method which doesn't cause a mutation to a class instance. Or should it? Let's look at the implementation. void SomeClass::setField(int val) { setGetField(true, val); } void SomeClass::getField() { return setGetField(false); } Wait, what? Why are we passing a boolean to a method called setGet. Why is there a method called setGet? They didn't go and make a method that both sets and gets, and decide which they're doing based on a boolean flag, did they? int SomeClass::setGetField(bool set, int val) { static int s_val = 0; if (set) { s_val = val; } return s_val; } Oh, good, they didn't just make a function that maybe sets or gets based on a boolean flag. They also made the state within that function a static field. And yes, function level statics are not scoped to an instance, so this is shared across all instances of the class. So it's not encapsulated at all, and we've blundered back into Singletons again, somehow. Our anonymous submitter had two reactions. Upon seeing this the first time, they wondered: \"WTF? This must be some kind of joke. I'm being pranked.\" But then they saw the pattern again. And again. After seeing it fifty times, they wondered: \"WTF? Who hired these developers? And can that hiring manager be fired? Out of a cannon? Into the sun?\" [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time.
