    "description": "Not all great neighbors make great friends. We all know this to be true, and yet you would be surprised at how many supposedly mature adults in this world still want to be best friends with all the people nearby. It's a middle school mentality that some people never get over as they grow up. You do not have to be best friends with everyone who is a part of your life; as long as you show decency and respect toward one another, you should be able to peacefully coexist. If I could say that once more for the people in the back, I would.The author of this story sounds an awful lot like Chris Robinson's character in the new movie, Friendship. Once he got a taste of being pals with the guys next door, he couldn't fathom that they would want to occasionally throw parties without them. Of course, the other guys are not necessarily blameless in this story. It sounds like they could be a bit more subtle, but they are certainly not obligated to be besties with the author just because of their close proximity to one another.

    "description": "This person is in a delicious dilemma with an unappreciative classmate. Growing up, I knew someone who worked at a donut chain. This is an awesome perk for so many reasons: they snagged us free drinks and free donuts constantly. It's hard to overstate just how many free donuts we all got! This person could routinely bring 2 or 3 dozen donuts home just because they felt like it. Sadly, at the end of the day at many bakeries, all the leftover donuts go straight into the garbage bin. We're not just talking like 10 donuts: some places routinely waste dozens of donuts. Instead of donating them, they go straight into a dumpster. So employees can take as many pastries home with them as they want, letting everyone in their life have a few delicious donuts. This high schooler was trying to share that wealth with their classmates, but it wasn't really working out, thanks to one classmate who felt it was her job to schedule out the snack days. Who even cares about that? Just enjoy the treats!Next, read about this overworked IT employee who had to stand up to their boss after they were given \"an impossible task.\"",

In any appropriate (and sometimes inappropriate) situation, we send funny cat memes to our friends. The best reaction meme is a cat meme, we think that just about every cat person would agree with us on that. What we cannot say is that we have used a cat meme to break bad news. Somehow, it feels particularly inappropriate to use a cat meme in a sad situation. Cat memes should remain the happy and pawsitive thing that they are. Or so we thought. We thought that cat memes in sad situations would feel inappropriate and disrespectful and wrong, but alas, we were mistaken. It seems that cat memes make sad situations funny. Still sad, but also funny. At least that is the feeling that we (and a lot of other people on the internet) got from this ridiculous viral thread on twitter. Are we biased when it comes to cat memes? Maybe. What do you think?",

    "description": "The cat distribution system works in mysterious ways. We think that every cat person who has heard of it knows this fact. It can catch you anytime and at any place. You can be someone who loves cats or someone who claims to hate cats. You can be going to a shelter and get adopted by the senior cat instead of the kitten you were looking for, or you could go on a hike and get adopted by a screaming kitten. And the CDS is not only limited to humans either. Sometimes, cats adopt dogs or other animals, and their connection is just as amazing as the one that you have with your cat.And that is pretty much what happened here. Sure, the kitten may have initially underestimated the dog's size and gotten a little spooked by it when he got closer, but what was meant to be happened. The CDS knew that this kitten belonged in this family before even the kitten himself knew it. And just like that, within a few days, the kitten and the doggo that he chose became best friends.",

    "description": "\"Don't use exception handling for normal flow control,\" is generally good advice. But Andy's lead had a PhD in computer science, and with that kind of education, wasn't about to let good advice or best practices tell them what to do. That's why, when they needed to validate inputs, they wrote code C# like this: public static bool IsDecimal(string theValue) { try { Convert.ToDouble(theValue); return true; } catch { return false; } } They attempt to convert, and if they succeed, great, return true. If they fail, an exception gets caught, and they return false. What could be simpler? Well, using the built in TryParse function would be simpler. Despite its name, actually avoids throwing an exception, even internally, because exceptions are expensive in .NET. And it is already implemented, so you don't have to do this. Also, Decimal is a type in C#- a 16-byte floating point value. Now, I know they didn't actually mean Decimal, just \"a value with 0 or more digits behind the decimal point\", but pedantry is the root of clarity, and the naming convention makes this bad code unclear about its intent and purpose. Per the docs there are Single and Double values which can't be represented as Decimal and trigger an OverflowException. And conversely, Decimal loses precision if converted to Double. This means a value that would be represented as Decimal might not pass this function, and a value that can't be represented as Decimal might, and none of this actually matters but the name of the function is bad.
