    "description": "As a parent, there's nothing more valuable than time with your kids. Especially when they're little, time flies by so quickly, and their childhood goes by in a flash. Suddenly, your sweet baby is turning into a teenager before your eyes, and it's as if only a few short moments have passed. This dutiful dad in our next story found a way to capitalize on every moment with his growing son by taking advantage of his own work ethic. With the advantageous 'project manager' title at his back, he carved out 2-hour lunches every single day, blocking out his calendar and marking himself as 'busy' so that he could hang out with his growing young son at home. Some may call this remote worker's tactics 'cheating the system,' but as a worker familiar with how the system cheats us, I'd say he's just found the perfect loophole to be the best dad possible. I say, if you can get the job done, exceed expectations, and remain a valuable asset to the team, so what if you only work a 30-hour work week for 40 hours of pay?",

Or maybe you have a friend who you used to love grabbing dinner with a few times a month, but now this person has a whole new friend group? Yeah, a friendship breakup often hurts bad, and there may not even be a good reason for it. You may just outgrow each other's company, and realize that you no longer get along anymore. It's painful (some would say it's worse than a breakup). These friends are having their falling-out over an ill-fated broken MacBook… check out the full tale, as well as an update, down below. Next, read the story of the hair salon customer who wouldn't plunk down a tip on a $950 hair service, leading the cashier to tell her she's \"not welcome back.\"",

    "description": "Ahhhh, Sundays. The third best day of the week, but certainly the most relaxing. Caturdays are the best day of the week (obviously), followed by Furidays, and Sundays come safely in third. Sundays are the only day of the week when we can expurrience what it's like to be a cat for a little bit and nap without consequence. Sure, we can't take 17 naps on Sundays, but one or two won't hurt us because we have nothing else to do.One of the things we love the most is when our cats purrfect full shrimp-mode when they sleep. We love seeing their little feetsies stick out and their content, sleepy faces as they dream about catching mice or rolling in catnip. It's so cute, in fact, that we could scroll through a whole listicle of cats in shrimp-mode… hey, that's a great idea! Good thing we're so smart because we've already gathered all these cats into a seafood special for you to enjoy below. Happy Sunday - we hope it's purrfectly restful and full of feline shrimp.",

With enough determination and procrastination, we can get you - and ourselves - ready for the week ahead. Oh, and with a whole bunch of funny cat memes to enjoy first thing in the morning. Because let's be honest, hissterical cat memes like the ones we have for you today have the ability to fix all of our problems, take away all of our sadness, and get rid of all our mistakes. Or… at the very least, laughing at a bunch of cat memes throughout the day can help us ignore all of these things until we have no choice but to face them again tomorrow. So, that is what we are going to do. And because we think that all of you guys could enjoy some of that as well, we are going to share them with all of you guys as well.",

    "description": "It's just the same refrain, over and over. \"Time Travel! Again?\" exclaimed David B. \"I knew that Alaska is a good airline. Now I get to return at the start of a century. And not this century. The one before air flight began.\" To be fair, David, there never is just one first time for time travel. It's always again, isn't it?   \"If it's been that long, I definitely need a holiday,\" headlined Craig N. \"To be fair, all the destinations listed in the email were in ancient Greece, and not in countries that are younger than Jesus.\"   An anonymous reader reports \"Upon being told my site was insecure because insufficient authorization, I clicked the provided link to read up on specifics of the problem and suggestions for how to resolve it. To my surprise, Edge blocked me, but I continued on bravely only to find...this.\"   Footie fan Morgan has torn his hair out over this. \"For the life of me I can't work out how this table is calculated. It's not just their league either. Others have the same weird positioning of teams based on their points. It must be pointed out that this is the official TheFA website as well not just some hobbyist site.\" It's too late for me, but I'm frankly baffled as well.   Most Excellent Stephen is stoked to send us off with this. \"Each year we have to renew the registration on our vehicles. It is not something we look forward to no matter which state you live in. A few years ago Texas introduced an online portal for this which was an improvement, if you didn't wait until the last minute of course. Recently they added a feature to the portal to track the progress of your renewal and see when they mail the sticker to you. I was pleasantly surprised to see the status page.\"   [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds. Learn more.",

    "description": "DZ's tech lead is a doctor of computer science, and that doctor loves to write code. But you already know that \"PhD\" stands for \"Piled high and deep\", and that's true of the tech lead's clue. For example, in C#: private List ExtractListForId(string id) { List list = new List(); lock (this) { var items = _foos.Where(f =\u003e f.Id == id).ToList(); foreach (var item in items) { list.Add(item); } } return list; } The purpose of this function is to find all the elements in a list where they have a matching ID. That's accomplished in one line: _foo.Where(f =\u003e f.Id == id). For some reason, the function goes through the extra step of iterating across the returned list and constructing a new one. There's no real good reason for this, though it does force LINQ to be eager- by default, the Where expression won't be evaluated until you check the results. The lock is in there for thread safety, which hey- the enumerator returned by Where is not threadsafe, so that's not a useless thing to do there. But it's that lock which hints at the deeper WTF here: our PhD-having-tech-lead knows that adding threads ensures you're using more of the CPU, and they've thrown threads all over the place without any real sense to it. There's no clear data ownership of any given thread, which means everything is locked to hell and back, the whole thing frequently deadlocks, and it's impossible to debug. It's taken days for DZ to get this much of a picture of what's going on in the code, and further untangling of this multithreaded pile of spaghetti is going to take many, many more days- and much, much more of DZ's sanity.
