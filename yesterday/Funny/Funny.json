    "description": "Sean sends us a one-line function that is a delight, if by delight you mean \"horror\". You'll be shocked to know it's PHP. function proget(){foreach($_GET as $k=\u003e$v){if($k==\"h\"){$GLOBALS[\"h\"]=1;}$p=explode(\",\",$k);}return($p);} //function to process GET headers Based on the comment, proget is a shorthand for process_get_parameters. Which is sort of what it does. Sort of. Let's go through this. We iterate across our $_GET parameters using $k for the key, $v for the value, but we never reference the value so forget it exists. We're iterating across every key. The first thing we check is if a key \"h\" exists. We don't look at its value, we just check if it exists, and if it does, we set a global variable. And this, right here, is enough for this to be a WTF. The logic of \"set a global variable based on the existence of a query parameter regardless of the value of the query parameter\" is… a lot. But then, somehow, this actually gets more out there. We explode the key on commas (explode being PHP's much cooler name for split), which implies… our keys may be lists of values? Which I feel like is an example of someone not understanding what a \"key\" is. But worse than that, we just do this for every key, and return the results of performing that operation on the last key. Which means that if this function is doing anything at all, it's entirely dependent on the order of the keys. Which, PHP does order the keys by the order they're added, which I take to mean that if the URL has query params like ?foo=1\u0026h=0\u0026a,b,c,d=wtf. Or, if we're being picky about encoding, ?foo=1\u0026h=0\u0026a%2Cb%2Cc%2Cd=wtf. The only good news here is that PHP handles the encoding/decoding for you, so the explode will work as expected. This is the kind of bad code that leaves me with lots of questions, and I'm not sure I want any of the answers. How did this happen, and why are questions best left unanswered, because I think the answers might cause more harm.

    "description": "Today's anonymous submitter worked for a \"large, US-based, e-commerce company.\" This particular company was, some time back, looking to save money, and like so many companies do, that meant hiring offshore contractors. Now, I want to stress, there's certainly nothing magical about national borders which turns software engineers into incompetents. The reality is simply that contractors never have their client's best interests at heart; they only want to be good enough to complete their contract. This gets multiplied by the contracting firm's desire to maximize their profits by keeping their contractors as booked as possible. And it gets further multiplied by the remoteness and siloing of the interaction, especially across timezones. Often, the customer sends out requirements, and three months later gets a finished feature, with no more contact than that- and it never goes well. All that said, let's look at some SQL Server code. It's long, so we'll take it in chunks. -- =============================================================================== -- Author : Ignacius Ignoramus -- Create date: 04-12-2020 -- Description: SP of Getting Discrepancy of Allocation Reconciliation Snapshot -- =============================================================================== That the comment reinforces that this is an \"SP\", aka stored procedure, is already not my favorite thing to see. The description is certainly made up of words, and I think I get the gist. ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[Discrepency] ( @startDate DATETIME, @endDate DATETIME ) AS BEGIN Nothing really to see here; it's easy to see that we're going to run a query for a date range. That's fine and common. DECLARE @tblReturn TABLE ( intOrderItemId INT ) Hmm. T-SQL lets you define table variables, which are exactly what they sound like. It's a local variable in this procedure, that acts like a table. You can insert/update/delete/query it. The vague name is a little sketch, and the fact that it holds only one field also makes me go \"hmmm\", but this isn't bad. DECLARE @tblReturn1 TABLE ( intOrderItemId INT ) Uh oh. DECLARE @tblReturn2 TABLE ( intOrderItemId INT ) Oh no. DECLARE @tblReturn3 TABLE ( intOrderItemId INT ) Oh no no no. DECLARE @tblReturn4 TABLE ( intOrderItemId INT ) This doesn't bode well. So they've declared five variables called tblReturn, that all hold the same data structure. What happens next? This next block is gonna be long. INSERT INTO @tblReturn --(intOrderItemId) VALUES (@_ordersToBeAllocated) /* OrderItemsPlaced */ select intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..Orders o inner join CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi on oi.intOrderId = o.intOrderId where o.dtmTimeStamp between @startDate and @endDate AND intOrderItemId Not In ( /* _itemsOnBackorder */ select intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi inner join CompanyDatabase..Orders o on o.intOrderId = oi.intOrderId where o.dtmTimeStamp between @startDate and @endDate and oi.strstatus='backordered' ) AND intOrderItemId Not In ( /* _itemsOnHold */ select intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi inner join CompanyDatabase..Orders o on o.intOrderId = oi.intOrderId where o.dtmTimeStamp between @startDate and @endDate and o.strstatus='ONHOLD' and oi.strStatus \u003c\u003e 'BACKORDERED' ) AND intOrderItemId Not In ( /* _itemsOnReview */ select intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi inner join CompanyDatabase..Orders o on o.intOrderId = oi.intOrderId where o.dtmTimeStamp between @startDate and @endDate and o.strstatus='REVIEW' and oi.strStatus \u003c\u003e 'BACKORDERED' ) AND intOrderItemId Not In ( /*_itemsOnPending*/ select intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi inner join CompanyDatabase..Orders o on o.intOrderId = oi.intOrderId where o.dtmTimeStamp between @startDate and @endDate and o.strstatus='PENDING' and oi.strStatus \u003c\u003e 'BACKORDERED' ) AND intOrderItemId Not In ( /*_itemsCancelled */ select intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi inner join CompanyDatabase..Orders o on o.intOrderId = oi.intOrderId where o.dtmTimeStamp between @startDate and @endDate and oi.strstatus='CANCELLED' ) We insert into @tblReturn the result of a query, and this query relies heavily on using a big pile of subqueries to decide if a record should be included in the output- but these subqueries all query the same tables as the root query. I'm fairly certain this could be a simple join with a pretty readable where clause, but I'm also not going to sit here and rewrite it right now, we've got a lot more query to look at. INSERT INTO @tblReturn1 /* _backOrderItemsReleased */ select intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi inner join CompanyDatabase..orders o on o.intorderid = oi.intorderid where oi.intOrderItemid in ( select intRecordID from CompanyDatabase..StatusChangeLog where strRecordType = 'OrderItem' and strOldStatus in ('BACKORDERED') and strNewStatus in ('NEW', 'RECYCLED') and dtmTimeStamp between @startDate and @endDate ) and o.dtmTimeStamp \u003c @startDate UNION ( /*_pendingHoldItemsReleased*/ select intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi inner join CompanyDatabase..orders o on o.intorderid = oi.intorderid where oi.intOrderID in ( select intRecordID from CompanyDatabase..StatusChangeLog where strRecordType = 'Order' and strOldStatus in ('REVIEW', 'ONHOLD', 'PENDING') and strNewStatus in ('NEW', 'PROCESSING') and dtmTimeStamp between @startDate and @endDate ) and o.dtmTimeStamp \u003c @startDate ) UNION /* _reallocationsowingtonostock */ ( select oi.intOrderItemID from CompanyDatabase.dbo.StatusChangeLog inner join CompanyDatabase.dbo.OrderItems oi on oi.intOrderItemID = CompanyDatabase.dbo.StatusChangeLog.intRecordID inner join CompanyDatabase.dbo.Orders o on o.intOrderId = oi.intOrderId where strOldStatus = 'RECYCLED' and strNewStatus = 'ALLOCATED' and CompanyDatabase.dbo.StatusChangeLog.dtmTimestamp \u003e @endDate and strRecordType = 'OrderItem' and intRecordId in ( select intRecordId from CompanyDatabase.dbo.StatusChangeLog where strOldStatus = 'ALLOCATED' and strNewStatus = 'RECYCLED' and strRecordType = 'OrderItem' and CompanyDatabase.dbo.StatusChangeLog.dtmTimestamp between @startDate and @endDate ) ) Okay, just some unions with more subquery filtering. More of the same. It's the next one that makes this special. INSERT INTO @tblReturn2 SELECT intOrderItemId FROM @tblReturn UNION SELECT intOrderItemId FROM @tblReturn1 Ah, here's the stuff. This is just bonkers. If the goal is to combine the results of these queries into a single table, you could just insert into one table the whole time. But we know that there are 5 of these tables, so why are we only going through the first two to combine them at this point? INSERT INTO @tblReturn3 /* _factoryAllocation*/ select oi.intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..Shipments s inner join CompanyDatabase..ShipmentItems si on si.intShipmentID = s.intShipmentID inner join Common.CompanyDatabase.Stores stores on stores.intStoreID = s.intLocationID inner join CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi on oi.intOrderItemId = si.intOrderItemId inner join CompanyDatabase..Orders o on o.intOrderId = s.intOrderId where s.dtmTimestamp \u003e= @endDate and stores.strLocationType = 'FACTORY' UNION ( /*_storeAllocations*/ select oi.intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase..Shipments s inner join CompanyDatabase..ShipmentItems si on si.intShipmentID = s.intShipmentID inner join Common.CompanyDatabase.Stores stores on stores.intStoreID = s.intLocationID inner join CompanyDatabase..OrderItems oi on oi.intOrderItemId = si.intOrderItemId inner join CompanyDatabase..Orders o on o.intOrderId = s.intOrderId where s.dtmTimestamp \u003e= @endDate and stores.strLocationType \u003c\u003e 'FACTORY' ) UNION ( /* _ordersWithAllocationProblems */ select oi.intOrderItemId from CompanyDatabase.dbo.StatusChangeLog inner join CompanyDatabase.dbo.OrderItems oi on oi.intOrderItemID = CompanyDatabase.dbo.StatusChangeLog.intRecordID inner join CompanyDatabase.dbo.Orders o on o.intOrderId = oi.intOrderId where strRecordType = 'orderitem' and strNewStatus = 'PROBLEM' and strOldStatus = 'NEW' and CompanyDatabase.dbo.StatusChangeLog.dtmTimestamp \u003e @endDate and o.dtmTimestamp \u003c @endDate ) Okay, @tblReturn3 is more of the same. Nothing more to really add. INSERT INTO @tblReturn4 SELECT intOrderItemId FROM @tblReturn2 WHERE intOrderItemId NOT IN(SELECT intOrderItemId FROM @tblReturn3 ) Ooh, but here we see something a bit different- we're taking the set difference between @tblReturn2 and @tblReturn3. This would almost make sense if there weren't already set operations in T-SQL which would handle all of this. Which brings us, finally, to the last query in the whole thing: SELECT o.intOrderId ,oi.intOrderItemId ,o.dtmDate ,oi.strDescription ,o.strFirstName + o.strLastName AS 'Name' ,o.strEmail ,o.strBillingCountry ,o.strShippingCountry FROM CompanyDatabase.dbo.OrderItems oi INNER JOIN CompanyDatabase.dbo.Orders o on o.intOrderId = oi.intOrderId WHERE oi.intOrderItemId IN (SELECT intOrderItemId FROM @tblReturn4) END At the end of all this, I've determined a few things. First, the developer responsible didn't understand table variables. Second,they definitely didn't understand joins. Third, they had no sense of the overall workflow of this query and just sorta fumbled through until they got results that the client said were okay. And somehow, this pile of trash made it through a code review by internal architects and got deployed to production, where it promptly became the worst performing query in their application. Correction: the worst performing query thus far. [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands. Download today!",

Now, that doesn't mean that we won't grow up and make mistakes or cave into that devil on our shoulder every now and again and help ourselves to something we know we really shouldn't, but in those times we'll at least know we've done something wrong and hopefully the act itself won't be so severe.

    "description": "Being a social media manager might seem like a lofty, pie-in-the-sky kind of job, but it's a lot harder than people give it credit for. It seems cutesy, right? You picture a young person sitting around on their phone, smiling as they post a photo. That's part of the job, sure, but there's like 90% more to it than that! You've got to plan out the timing of the post, what it will say, who you'll tag, what hashtags you'll use, what other social media sites you'll post it on… the list goes on and on. Then, you do that a dozen more times throughout the day. And for one person, working with a client on a social media campaign just made the whole thing way harder. This dude just would not listen to the social media worker: instead, he kept insisting that they were wrong. He swiftly regretted that, as you can check out in the full story below, as well as in the comments, where the social media manager revealed more information about the story. Up next, have a slice of these bad days in the bakery, like one person who revealed \"the cake that got my coworker fired.\"",

    "description": "Hey there friends and feline enthusiasts. Losing a beloved pet is one of the most heartbreaking experiences a family can go through. It creates a space in your home and your heart that feels impossible to fill. So when a tiny, scrappy kitten appeared in the yard just days after this family lost their sweet dog, it felt like more than a coincidence. It felt like something bigger.For two weeks, they fed him every night, unsure if he had a home or if he would let them get close. Eventually, they were able to bring him inside, where a vet confirmed he was just 12 weeks old and born the very same week their dog had passed. Covered in dirt and severely underweight, he clearly needed a family just as much as they needed him.They named him Franklin, and over the past five months, he has settled into their lives like he was meant to be there all along. From play-fighting with their other dog to sleeping on his human's chest every night, Franklin has become a source of joy and healing. His soft purrs and tiny coos are daily reminders that sometimes the universe delivers exactly what you need right when you need it most. And now our hearts have been officially warmed.",

    "description": "Every chonky cat child has a secret to confess. Usually it has to do with where they have been stashing their stolen treats, but today they are confessing to something much more serious. For today, the chonkers of the cat world are coming clean about their intrusive thoughts and what they have made them do. Which as you can imagine must contain some seriously strange behaviors, considering that these creatures consider hiding stolen treats to be a normal part of everyday life.So if you have been wanting to know why your fur baby has been behaving strangely, or you simply love indulging in the gossipy goodness of clawminal cat children, then we recommend locking into this list with three seatbelts and holding on tight for a wild ride.",
