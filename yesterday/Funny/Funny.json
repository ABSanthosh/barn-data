    "description": "You don't know a good thing until it's gone: a phrase that is applicable to so many areas of life. And it fits quite neatly in the sense of employers who are asking far too much of their best workers with little recognition or fair compensation.This media designer slowly found themselves, over time, burdened with more and more responsibilities that were unrelated to their own actual role, over time eventually taking on the equivalent roles of \"at least\" four people. Finding themselves on the hook for their own materials and equipment as if they were a contractor despite, you know, being employed by the company. Over time, they built up their own inventory of all the necessary high-end equipment, totaling many thousands of dollars, that they were using for their work to host all of the company's production needs.Foolishly, their boss let them know that the company was \"downsizing,\"… aka they were being laid off so that the company could employ someone fresh-faced and cheaper. Well, it turns out \"cheaper\" is a relative thing when the company doesn't own any of its own equipment, and the company was short-sighted and foolish enough not to realize what it had going for them was a good thing… The media designer, of course, took all their equipment with them, seeing the fear slowly growing in their boss's eyes as they packed everything up that was theirs.The poster unfortunately didn't elaborate on what happened from there, but we'd like to think that, having all the necessary equipment already, they went on to start their own business.",

    "description": "Sometimes, there is nothing better than a late-night fast food order. Who wants a salad after a night out? Nine times out of ten, these fast food cravings could be resolved by just forgetting about it and going to bed, but where's the fun in that? The reality is there is a rush of adrenaline and excitement that comes when you decide to stop monitoring yourself for a moment and let yourself be free. By freedom, of course, we mean the freedom to order a quarterpounder, chicken tenders, or whatever your late-night food craving is. Failure to follow your heart when it comes to these desperate times can often result in feelings of regret or even greater, more intense late-night cravings on subsequent evenings. You might as well just give in and enjoy yourself. You can deal with the consequences afterward.Between now and your next McDonald's order at two in the morning, please enjoy these fast food-themed memes.

And no, not because they are adorable and funny and the best thing about your entire house, no matter what your house is. Obviously you have to be thankful for that every day. We're not talking about that. No, we are talking about the fact that you have to be thankful that your cat chose you. Because yes, that is exactly what happened. You did not choose your cat. The cats choose their humans. Some of us, the ones who read stories of people rescuing cats and being chosen by them every single day, know this fact. But some of us still believe the opposite. Well, there is no denying it today. Here, clearly the Cat Distribution System at work was at work when it made this kitten fall asleep inside of this man's shoe.",

Because while we try to skirt around the subject, our cats would be totally fine without us, and we are hardly their keepers, if anything they are very ungrateful tenants who criticize and comment on every decision we make. So to set the record straight, we made this list of sassy cat balling us out for being soft silly hoomans who have no idea how the world works. And they are completely correct.From the incredibly cross cat who hates going to the vet, not because it is an unpleasant experience, but for the fact that it is the only thing that hoomans have gotten right, to the hardworking catto who looks utterly mad at his coworkers for being so lazy and in efficient at their jobs, to the frustrated feline who was woke up mid-wonder nap and looks set for a night of clawminality.",

    "description": "\"Oh, I see what you mean, I'll just write an overloaded function which takes the different set of parameters,\" said the senior dev. That got SB's attention. You see, they were writing JavaScript, which doesn't have function overloading. \"Um,\" SB said, \"you're going to do what?\" \"Function overloading,\" the senior dev said. \"It's when you write multiple versions of the same method with different signatures-\" \"I know what it is,\" SB said. \"I'm just wondering how you're going to do that in JavaScript.\" \"Ah,\" the senior dev said with all the senior dev wisdom in the world. \"It's a popular misconception that function overloading isn't allowed in JavaScript. See this?\" function addMarker(lat,lng,title,desc,pic,link,linktext,cat,icontype) { addMarker(lat,lng,title,desc,pic,link,linktext,cat,icontype,false); } function addMarker(lat,lng,title,desc,pic,link,linktext,cat,icontype,external) { /* preparation code */ if (external){ /* glue code */ } else { /* other glue code */ } } This, in fact, did not overload the function. This first created a version of addMarker which called itself with the wrong number of parameters. It then replaced that definition with a new one that actually did the work. That it worked at all was a delightful coincidence- when you call a JavaScript function with too few parameters, it just defaults the remainders to null, and null is falsy.

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/ripping-away-the-mask",
    "description": "Jason was investigating a bug in a bitmask. It should have been set to 0b11, but someone had set it to just plain decimal 11. The line responsible looked like this: byte number = (byte) 11; This code takes the decimal number 11, casts it to a byte, and stores it in a byte, leaving us with the decimal number 11. Curious, Jason checked the blame and saw that one of their senior-most devs was responsible. Figuring this was a good opportunity to poke a little fun at the dev for a silly mistake like this, Jason sent them a message about the difficulties of telling apart decimal values and binary values when the decimal value only contained ones and zeroes. \"What are you talking about?\" the dev replied back. \"The (byte) operator tells the compiler that the number is in binary.\" Concerned by that reply, Jason started checking the rest of the code. And sure enough, many places in the code, the senior dev had followed this convention. Many of them were wrong, and just hadn't turned into a bug yet. One of two were coincidentally setting the important bits anyway. Now, in a vague \"defense\" of what the senior dev was trying to do, C doesn't have a standard way of specifying binary literals. GCC and Clang both have a non-standard extension which lets you do 0b11, but that's not standard. So I understand the instinct- \"there should be an easy way to do this,\" even if anyone with more than a week's experience *should have known better*. But the real moral of the story is: don't use bitmasks without also using constants. It never should have been written with literals, it should have been written as byte number = FLAG_A | FLAG_B. The #define for the flags could be integer constants, or if you're feeling spicy about it, bitshift operations: #define FLAG_A = (1 \u003c\u003c 1). Then you don't need binary literals, and also your code is actually readable for humans. It was difficult to track down all the places where this misguided convention for binary literals was followed, as it was hard to tell the difference between that and a legitimate cast to byte. Fortunately, there weren't that many places where bitmasks were getting set. [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.
