    "description": "It's great to go out of your way to do things for others. I'd argue it's even an often-overlooked societal obligation to look out for other people. But when going out of your way becomes a base-level expectation, even a demand, rather than something that's appreciated and willingly given. This begs the question of how far and for how long you should be willing to go for other people and—well… how long is a piece of string?When this 20-year-old college student found out that her 19-year-old cousin drives to her university classes rather than taking public transport or other means, she probably started thinking about how unfair it was that she didn't have her own way of driving to classes. So, of course, she probably told her mother (the other girl's aunt), who began demanding that the younger girl drive her to her classes.Outside of the fact that they don't even go to the same school, there are a myriad of reasons why this wouldn't work out. Colleges don't really tend to have a start and end time, and it's really just what your schedule is for that given quarter that determines when you go to class and when you leave. But that didn't stop the extended family from getting involved when the younger girl refused to drive her cousin, throwing around accusations of selfishness and spoiledness.",

    "description": "Black cats are a blessing. It is long rumored that black cats bring bad luck, but nothing could be further from the truth. Black cats are a true blessing of cuteness, beauty, and lots of feline funnies. We asked the black cat pawrents around the office why having a black cat is such a blessing, and these are our favorite answers, in no particular order:\"I was gaming in the dark and was sure my cat was lounging next to me on the table. Every time I lost, I talked it through with my cat, like she was there to help me through the frustration. After I turned the game off, I realized I was talking to my crumpled black sweatshirt all along.\" \"A couple of nights ago, I was about to fall asleep when I felt my absolute unit of a cat jump onto the bed. He usually does that when I'm falling asleep, so I was not surprised, but this time - he was climbing onto my chest, putting his face an inch from mine, and releasing the loudest meow out of his mouth. I opened my eyes in horror and saw nothing but his glowing eyes in the darkness of his fur and the room. With his chonker weight pressing on my chest, I thought that this is what paralysis demon must feel like.\" \"My partner and I were looking for my void cat everywhere for a few minutes, just because I wondered where she could be. We called her name a few times, and nothing. She doesn't usually respond to her name, but we walked around the house, looking in her usual hiding spots and napping places, we couldn't find her. I started worrying, but then my partner called me and pointed to the turned-off TV - lo and behold, my cat was just sitting in front of the black screen in complete camouflage. Panic averted.\"",

    "description": "Mark sends us a very simple Java function which has the job of parsing an integer from a string. Now, you might say, \"But Java has a built in for that, Integer.parseInt,\" and have I got good news for you: they actually used it. It's just everything else they did wrong. private int makeInteger(String s) { int i=0; try { Integer.parseInt(s); } catch (NumberFormatException e) { i=0; return i; } i=Integer.parseInt(s); return i; } This function is really the story of variable i, the most useless variable ever. It's doing its best, but there's just nothing for it to do here. We start by setting i to zero. Then we attempt to parse the integer, and do nothing with the result. If it fails, we set i to zero again, just for fun, and then return i. Why not just return 0? Because then what would poor i get to do? Assuming we didn't throw an exception, we parse the input again, storing its result in i, and then return i. Again, we treat i like a child who wants to help paint the living room: we give it a dry brush and a section of wall we're not planning to paint and let it go to town. Nothing it does matters, but it feels like a participant. Now, Mark went ahead and refactored this function basically right away, into a more terse and clear version: private int makeInteger(String s) { try { return Integer.parseInt(s); } catch (NumberFormatException e) { return 0; } } He went about his development work, and then a few days later came across makeInteger reverted back to its original version. For a moment, he wanted to be mad at someone for reverting his change, but no- this was in an entirely different class. With that information, Mark went and did a search for makeInteger in the code, only to find 39 copies of this function, with minor variations. There are an unknown number of copies of the function where the name is slightly different than makeInteger, but a search for Integer.parseInt implies that there may be many more.
