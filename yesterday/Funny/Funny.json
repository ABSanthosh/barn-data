    "description": "On the job site, always trust your engineer. Contrarily, this nepo-hire project manager only trusted himself and it was wholly misplaced. Without any knowledge of the scientific specifics, he decided to make a unilateral decision that would cost a lot more than a few lost days on the job—it would cost his company millions in damages, time, rebuilds, and ultimately, his career. In my opinion, it serves someone right to pay the price when they've overstepped their wheelhouse. Especially when we're talking about potentially dangerous, life-threatening scenarios on a construction site, safety measures and failsafes are not to be trifled with. Likely driven by ego, this hot-headed personality hire was severely punished for being a total dingus—and rightfully so.",

    "description": "Whether you're a real homeowner or an aspiring one with a vision board the size of a house, these memes will get a good laugh out of you. It's not a shock to anyone that the interest rates for owning property including mortgage, financing, etc. are high. I rent, I am 23 years old, and live in New York City, so I'm a bit unfamiliar with the average homeowner's day-to-day. I can only imagine that it's something like this: Looking around for something to fix, fixing it, finding something else to fix, fixing that, then getting frustrated with both fix-up jobs and taking all of your fix-ups away. Is that accurate? As a renter, I call my landlord and beg them to do something. At least all I have to do is pick up the phone…If you're feeling down about being a homeowner because we all have those days, these memes will perk you right up and remind you why you chose to live the dream. Dreamin and memein'.",

    "description": "Good meowrning, I Can Has-ers. We think all cats are beautiful, from the meowjestic maine coons to the standard-issue tabby cats that are a dime a dozen. Each cat has their own unique traits that make them beautiful and we don't need a fancy or rare fur pattern to convince us that each cat is the most beautiful cat in the world. That's because as long as the cat wants love, trusts us, and considers us its family (or servants, as the case may be), we think that that is where the beauty comes from.Now, don't get us wrong, our jaws still drop when we see a beautiful bengal…we have even been known to stop in our tracks for a sultry serval cat every so often. But those physical things don't matter to us, and they also didn't to the wholesome people in this post! They found a stray street cat in need, fell in love with him and adopted him, only to realize later that he is a \"designer breed\" that is not only uncommon, but expensive.

    "description": "Today we have a whole batch of category errors, picked out from the rash of submissions and a few that have been festering on the shelf. Just for fun, I threw in an ironic off-by-some meta-error. See if you can spot it. Adam R. \"I'm looking for hotel rooms for the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina. Most hotels haven't opened up reservations yet, except for ridiculously overprice hospitality packages. This search query found NaN facilities available, which equates to one very expensive apartment. I guess one is not a number now?\"   Intrepid traveler BJH had a tough time at the Intercontinental. I almost feel sympathy. Almost. \"I stare at nulls at home all the time so it made me feel comfortable to see them at the hotel when traveling. And what is that 'INTERCONTINENTAL W...' at the top? I may never know!\"   Hoping to find out, BJ clicked through the mystery menu and discovered... this. But even worse, \"There was no exit: Clicking Exit did nothing and neither did any of the buttons on the remote. Since I'd received more entertainment than usual from a hotel screen I just turned everything off.\"   Striking out for some streaming entertainment Dmitry NoLastName was silently stymied by this double-decker from Frontier.com.   No streaming needed for Barry M. who can get a full dose of fun from those legacy broadcast channels! Whatever did they do before null null undefined null? \"Hey, want to watch TV tonight? NaN.\"   Hah! \"That's MISTER Null, to you,\" declared an anonymous contributor.   And finally, another entirely different anonymous contributor clarified that there are apparently NaN cellphone towers in Switzerland. Personally, I'm intrigued by the existence of that one little crumb of English on an otherwise entirely German page.   [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.

    "description": "Jenny had been perfectly happy working on a series of projects for her company, before someone said, \"Hey, we need you to build a desktop GUI for an existing API.\" The request wasn't the problem, per se. The API, on the other hand, absolutely was. The application Jenny was working on represented a billing contract for materials consumed at a factory. Essentially, the factory built a bunch of individual parts, and then assembled them into a finished product. They only counted the finished product, but needed to itemize the billing down to not only the raw materials that went into the finished product, the intermediate parts, but also the toilet paper put in the bathrooms. All the costs of operating the factory were derived from the units shipped out. This meant that the contract itself was a fairly complicated tree structure. Jenny's application was meant to both visualize and allow users to edit that tree structure to update the billing contract in sane, and predictable ways, so that it could be reviewed and approved and when the costs of toilet paper went up, those costs could be accurately passed on to the customer. Now, all the contract management was already implemented and lived library that itself called back into a database. Jenny just needed to wire it up to a desktop UI. Part of the requirements were that line items in the tree needed to have a special icon displayed next to them under two conditions: if one of their ancestors in the tree had been changed since the last released contract, or if they child was marked as \"inherit from parent\". The wrapper library wasn't documented, so Jenny asked the obvious question: \"What's the interface for this?\" The library team replied with this: IModelInheritFromParent : INotifyPropertyChanged { bool InheritFromParent {get; set;} } \"That covers the inheritance field,\" Jenny said, \"but that doesn't tell me if the ancestor has been modified.\" \"Oh, don't worry,\" the devs replied, \"there's an extension method for that.\" public bool GetChangedIndicator(this IModelTypeA); Extension methods in C# are just a way to use syntactic sugar to \"add\" methods to a class: IModelTypeA does not have a GetChangedIndicator method, but because of the this keyword, it's an extension method and we can now invoke aInstance.GetChangedIndicator(). It's how many built-in .Net APIs work, but like most forms of syntactic sugar, while it can be good, it usually makes code harder to understand, harder to test, and harder to debug. But Jenny's main complaint was this: \"You can't raise an event or something? I'm going to need to poll?\" \"Yes, you're going to need to poll.\" Jenny didn't like the idea of polling the (slow) database, so at first, she tried to run the polling in a background thread so it wouldn't block the UI. Unfortunately for her, the library was very much not threadsafe, so that blew up. She ended up needing to poll on the main UI thread, which meant the application would frequently stall while users were working. She did her best to minimize it, but it was impossible to eliminate. But worse than that, each contract item may implement one of four interfaces, which meant there were four versions of the extension method: public bool GetChangedIndicator(this IModelTypeA); public bool GetChangedIndicator(this IModelTypeB); public bool GetChangedIndicator(this IModelTypeC); public bool GetChangedIndicator(this IModelTypeD); To \"properly\" perform the check, Jenny would have to check which casts were valid for a given item, cast it, and then invoke GetChangedIndicator. It's worth noting that had they just used regular inheritance instead of extension methods, this wouldn't have been necessary at all. Using the \"fun\" syntactic sugar made the code more complicated for no benefit. This left Jenny with another question: \"What if an item implements more than one of these interfaces? What if the extension methods disagree on if the item is changed?\" \"Good question,\" the team responsible for the library replied. \"That should almost never happen.\" Jenny quit not long after this.
