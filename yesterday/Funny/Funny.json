    "description": "Job interviews are stressful as it is. You wonder if employers can smell desperation, if you're even qualified enough for the role you're interviewing for, and what the heck \"business casual\" even is. That's a serious question. What is it?…The worst part of a job interview is usually the nervousness you feel before the interview, and once the questions start rolling, a wave of relief washes over you like a welcoming ripple in a heated wave pool. All of your preparation and efforts amounted to this moment, and you have yourself to thank for your great answers. Unfortunately for the job seeker in this story, they didn't even get that far before hitting the road.If you're asked about unpaid overtime the moment the interview begins, run for the hills. This is not a drill. Though a paycheck seems golden at first, you'll end up on some other Reddit thread talking about how toxic your workplace is and how to get the heck out. Save yourself some time and scroll below to read the conversation commenters are having about salaries, hourly pay, and overtime.",

That's what makes cats so meowgical - they are these graceful, beautiful, sleek creatures….and also the derpiest things with four legs that walk on this Earth. They can be purrfectly perched on a windowsill looking like a gift from the heavens in all of their meowjestic beauty, and then you call their name, and they look at you with a face only a mother could love.Cats have the best qualities of us, combined with an accidental silliness that just makes the purrfect recipe for cuteness. They are quirky. They are weird. They are silly. They are gorgeous. They are soft. They are fluffy. They are the purrfect pets and companions. They are also our greatest source of entertainment, as well as the rulers of the internet. Please enjoy this kitty compilation of cats simply being cats because there is nothing better than a cat that embraces their own silly nature.",

    "description": "House cats combine two things that we hoomans so dearly revere. One is their ability to stay young in their mind, retaining moments of innocence and wonder that we have long forgotten about. And two, is their ability to do exactly what they want and have a plethora of ideas stored up. This inevitably leads them to having the time of their lives no matter what they get up to, because it is always full of wonder and always something they really want to do. And seeing how they usually get up to their shenanigans at night while we sleep or when we are away at work, we figured we would share some of these sweet moments with you such that you don't miss out.So without further delay we hope these hilarious house cats make your day.",

For me, it's just like a… taste, or smell. I'm receiving information from some kind of sense, and it is setting off red lights on the panel. Is that fair? I dunno. If I saw a huge lizard gnawing at the roots of Yggdrasil, to what extent am I required to give it the benefit of the doubt? We clown ourselves when we hold ourselves to baroque standards of fairness around malefactors like this. They know about the rules, they just think those rules are for other people.

I must say I don't recommend swimming the Ij in March, Rudi.   I had to go back quite a while for this submission from faithful reader Adam R., who chimed \"I found a new type of datetime handling failure in this timestamp of 12:8 PM when checking my past payments at my medical provider.\" I hope he's still with us.   Literary critic Jay commented \"Going back in time to be able to update your work after it gets published but before everyone else in your same space time fabric gets to see your mistakes, that's privilege.\" This kind of error is usually an artifact of Daylight Saving Time, but it's a day too late.   Lucky Luke H. can take his time with this deal. \"The board is proud to approve a 20% discount for the next 8 millenia,\" he crowed.   At nearly the other end of the entire modern era, Carlos found himself with a nostalgic device. \"Excel crashed.

    "description": "I remember in some intro-level compsci class learning that credit card numbers were checksummed, and writing basic functions to validate those checksums as an exercize. I was young and was still using my \"starter\" credit card with a whopping limit of $500, so that was all news to me. Alex's company had a problem processing credit cards: they rejected a lot of credit cards as being invalid. The checksum code seemed to be working fine, so what could the problem be? Well, the problem became more obvious when someone's card worked one day, and stopped working the very next day, and they just so happened to be the first and last day of the month. protected function validateExpirationCcDate($i_year, $i_month) { return (((int)strftime('%y') \u003c= $i_year) \u0026\u0026 ((int)strftime ('%m') \u003c= $i_month))? true : false; } This function is horrible; because it uses strftime (instead of taking the comparison date and time as a parameter) it's not unit-testable. We're (ab)using casts to convert strings into integers so we can do our comparison. We're using a ternary to return a boolean value instead of just returning the result of the boolean expression. But of course, that's all the amuse bouche: the main course is the complete misunderstanding of basic logic. According to this code, a credit card is valid if the expiration year is less than or equal to the current year and the month is less than or equal to the current month. As this article goes live in March, 2025, this code would allow credit cards from April, 2026, as it should. But it would reject any cards with an expiration of February, 2028. Per Alex, \"This is a credit card date validation that has been in use for ages.\" [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.
