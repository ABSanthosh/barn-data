We know that you're probably all very focused on Meow-lloween that's coming up, but we do feel that we should warn you about a dreaded day that comes soon after - daylight savings time. The day that plunges our future into eternal darkness (and not the fun kind like Grumpy Cat describes), that makes our days as short as a cat's attention span, and that takes all the pawsitivity out of our bodies and doesn't give it back for several months. If it weren't for all the hilarious feline funnies on the internet to add some light back into our lives, we would be lost in our sea of despair!Thank goodness we're here to prrrovide you with all the silly kitties in the form of digital delights you need to stay pawsitive during these dark times. Like, for instance, if these aren't enough, we have another cure to this upcoming ailment: iconic cat memes to use as inspawration for your Halloween costume! If that isn't the most wholesome, silly, cat-like thing to do, then we're not sure what is! So enjoy your scroll and remember, as long as there are cat memes on the internet, there is joy to be found.",

You only think that you are the one making the choice when you walk into an adoption center, looking around and trying to decide which cat is the one that would fit into your home the best. But in reality, behind your back, the Cat Distribution System is working its meowgic, and while you are browsing cats, the cats are browsing you back. There is no such a thing as adopting the \"wrong\" cat. Because if the cat chose you, then that was no mistake. And that's what this person learned the hard way in this thread. There was no \"wrong\" cat in this story. Everything happened the way that it was meant to, and everyone ended up happy.",

The philosophical razor states that one should \"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\" This is all well and good and helps one to let go of the atrocious and selfish behaviors they witness from others while out and about in the world: they don't mean to be that way they're just—well, dumb… I'd postulate, though, that there is a point where the two qualities of \"stupidity\" and \"malicious intent\" intersect—where qualities of significant incompetence become a point of cruelty and malevolence.This idea fits nicely in the case of this coworker who didn't excel in the areas of motivation or personal accountability, instead making her problems those of others with a complete lack of self-awareness.",

    "description": "Saying \"goodbye and good luck\" to a job you can't stand is such an empowering feeling. You know you're on to bigger and better things, while the managers you despise stay behind. When an employee starts considering leaving a job, there are a lot of factors to consider. They'll have to polish up that resume and start job hunting, which is a full-time job on its own. They are probably sick and tired of their boss, and maybe they're fed up with their coworkers and job duties as well. As they seek out a new position, they'll learn that the grass really is greener on the other side! A new job will not only treat them better, but will pay more and have better benefits. The current job often won't beg that employee to stay. They'll accept that two-week notice and start immediately searching for someone new to fill the role. For these people, quitting was an easy choice. U/virtueandsin got people to spill the beans about their final straws in the workplace, from mean bosses to petty customers and more. You can read all about it down below! After that, read about some family drama: this father excluded his son and daughter-in-law from a family trip, and they were incensed when they realized the truth about where the trip was scheduled!",

When he asked his peers, they were all surprised to see that the flag wasn't turning off debug logging. \"Hunh, that used to work. Someone must have changed something…\" Everyone had enough new development to do that tracking down a low priority bug fell to Jon. It didn't take long. const DEBUG_LOG = process.env.DEBUG_LOG || true According to the blame, the code had been like this for a year, the commit crammed with half a dozen features, was made by a developer who was no longer with the company, and the message was simply \"Debugging\". Presumably, this was intended to be a temporary change that accidentally got committed and no one noticed or cared. Jon fixed it, and moved on. There was likely going to be plenty more to find.
