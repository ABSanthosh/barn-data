It's like being born with a built-in best friend, greatest confidant, and still your greatest competitor and enemy. You're either laughing together over the most insane things that only the two of you would understand, or you're engaging in a cold war with both sides refusing to back down.When this younger 14-year-old brother got fed up with his 17-year-old sister for hogging the bathroom to use it as her private selfie studio, after her daily modeling sessions made him late for school several times, he decided to get even with her in a way that only a little brother can: unleashing a tiny plastic terror into the bathroom for her to discover.Unfortunately, the prank wasn't taken lightly, and her protests ended up getting their parents involved, who, rather than dealing with the issue, unequivocally decided to take the sister's side, parroting her audacicios claims of being \"traumatized\" and sending the younger teen running to this subreddit to see whether or not he was in the wrong for the conflict.",

We have heard of neighbors abandoning their cats and leaving them to fend for themselves, which is bad enough, but apparently, it's not even the tip of the iceberg. We have heard of neighbors stealing people's cats knowing that the cats belong to someone else. We have heard of entitled neighbors demanding people give their cats to them because they need the cat more. And today, we come across one of the most entitled neighbors yet. It's been a year since their cat has gone \"missing\", a year since their neighbor found the cat, rescued it, attempted to find its owners and been told by the vet that the cat is in such poor condition, there is no way it belonged to someone else. A year, and suddenly, these neighbors remember that they had a cat, start asking around about it, and once they find it, demand to get it back. The audacity is baffling.",

    "description": "If you're a cat pawrent, you know your cat has their routine. And honestly, every household with a cat in it is managed by the cat's schedule. That's just part of being a cat pawrent, there's nothing bad about it. Your cat decides you should get up at a specific time? Well, good morning then, because the cat has probably woken you up. Your cat is sure now it's dinner time? Bon appetit, because the cat won't stop meowing until dinner is served. Such are the lives of cat pawrents.But when your cat's routine is broken, cat pawrents get stressed. Oh, the woes of being a cat pawrent. But seriously, knowing your cat has a strict schedule and then, suddenly, it changes - it might raise some red flags. This is exactly what happened to a pair of parents who raise a cute tuxie cat. Their cat used to sleep in bed with them every night, even after they had kids. But at some point, the cat stopped sleeping in their bed. Routine change? That's suspicious. Especially because cats will be cats, meaning routine-oriented.The parents who are also pawrents investigated. But the investigation results were not as stressful as a cat changing their routine. The results were actually very, very cute. Apparently, the cat moved from one bed to another - from the parents' bed, to their toddler's bed. The cat decided that his sleeping place has changed now, and reality just has to comply. But the process of adjusting wasn't met with any objections - on the contrary, the kid embraced the idea, by embracing the cat and cuddling him to sleep.It was all caught on the security camera in the kid's room. Once shared, the online feline family collectively melted with how adorable this is. The wholesome comments came, describing hearts melting with cuteness. Some even shared their own cat cuddling stories, with cats and humans sleeping together at night. Honestly, our hearts have melted as well.",

    "description": "Andre has inherited a rather antique ASP .Net WebForms application. It's a large one, with many pages in it, but they all follow a certain pattern. Let's see if you can spot it. protected void btnSearch_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { ArrayList paramsRel = new ArrayList(); paramsRel[\"Name\"] = txtNome.Text; paramsRel[\"Date\"] = txtDate.Text; Session[\"paramsRel\"] = paramsRel; List clients = Controller.FindClients(); //Some other code } Now, at first glance, this doesn't look terrible. Using an ArrayList as a dictionary and frankly, storing a dictionary in the Session object is weird, but it's not an automatic red flag. But wait, why is it called paramsRel? They couldn't be… no, they wouldn't… public List FindClients() { ArrayList paramsRel = (ArrayList)Session[\"paramsRel\"]; string name = (string)paramsRel[\"Name\"]; string dateStr = (string)paramsRel[\"Date\"]; DateTime date = DateTime.Parse(dateStr); //More code... } Now there's the red flag. paramsRel is how they pass parameters to functions. They stuff it into the Session, then call a function which retrieves it from that Session. This pattern is used everywhere in the application. You can see that there's a vague gesture in the direction of trying to implement some kind of Model-View-Controller pattern (as FindClients is a member of the Controller object), but that modularization gets undercut by everything depending on Session as a pseudoglobal for passing state information around. The only good news is that the Session object is synchronized so there's no thread safety issue here, though not for want of trying. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.
