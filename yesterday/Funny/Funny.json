    "description": "You know what is one of the best things about cats? Sure, cats bring us peace, and that's awesome. And cats are so funny, and they make us laugh all the times with the silliest things, and that's awesome. And no one could argue about how cute cats are and about how them just existing in our homes, as their cute little selves, makes us happier. But it's not all of that. What truly makes cats purrfect… is the chaos they cause and the funny cat memes that we can make about them. You would think that an animal that is so lazy would not bring about that much chaos, but the sheer amount of ridiculous cat memes that there is out there should clue you in on the fact that you are wrong. They may sleep 12-16 hours a day, but during the few hours that they are awake, between the cleaning and eating, cats make sure that your life is never boring. And we love them for it.",

The charges: We uploaded such fluffing funny feline memes in a fuzzy frenzy, and these memes were not allowed to be this funny. It was an illegal act of hooman hubris, thinking we could bring such cat comedy to the masses. These memes were so funny that laughing at them could never be stopped. So the only choice the Cat Pawlice had was to stop us - and arrest us. We're not sure who called the Cat Pawlice and ratted us out, but they're here. This is goodbye.Since we're going to end up in cat jail, we leave you with these memes. We know that these cat memes are not allowed to be this funny, but wow, they're so fluffing funny.

    "description": "Living with other adults is difficult, especially since there will inevitably be shared household costs. Especially when you're living with others in your early 20s, it's highly likely that you're going to end up with a roommate who has yet to learn how to function as an adult. Heck, even when you get a little bit older, you quickly become accustomed to the fact that some people just aren't ever going to figure it out.People have different ways of living and different ideas about what is and isn't appropriate. Not to mention, when it comes to things like the temperature of the home and the costs associated with it, people naturally have different ideas about what is \"comfortable\" or \"tolerable.\" And as someone who runs perpetually hot and enjoys the crisp feeling of cold air, especially when it's snowy out, I have to stick up for this roommate at least a little bit and say that perhaps their other roommates are simply lizard people who like it to be WAY too hot inside… if the heat was on full-blast I'd want to have a window open too. Still, everything else about their apparent attitude makes it hard to support them in this disagreement. That being said, it sounds like this is an unpleasant living situation all around, and even the woman who shared this story probably isn't walking away completely clean.",

    "description": "Let's check in with the DIYers of the world and see how that's going. Oh it's… it's going off the rails? Cool, great! We'll be the judge of thees home remodeling disasterpieces. A lot of people do DIY projects to save money, but they end up making mistakes that cost them even more money to fix. For example, some people will try to tile their own floors or counters. During the early 2020s when we all spent a lot of time at home, this was quite common: people were spending lots of time in the home, bored to tears, so they figured they may as well try their hand at a DIY project. One dad here tried to build a couch out of what appear to be car seats. Another person decided to put recycled crushed cans on the outside of their home! That's not going to insulate your house better than siding would, and it's quite the eyesore at the same time. Some projects are better left to the professionals, as you'll see from the DIY disasters down below. After that, read about the boss who was infuriated that his employee \"quit without thinking twice\" after being offered a huge raise.",

    "description": "As often happens, Luka started some work but didn't get it across the finish line before a scheduled vacation. No problem: just hand it off to another experienced developer. Luka went off for a nice holiday, the other developer hammered away at code, and when Luka came back, there was this lovely method already merged to production, sitting and waiting: vvv(x, y) { return typeof x[y] !== 'undefined'; } \"What is this?\" Luka asked. \"Oh, it's a helper function to check if a property is defined on an object.\" Luka could see that much, but that didn't really answer the question. First, it wasn't the correct way to check if a property existed. Mind you, actually doing those checks in JavaScript is a complicated minefield because of prototype inheritance, but between the in operator, the hasOwn and hasOwnProperty methods, there are simpler and cleaner ways to get there. But of course, that wasn't what got anyone's attention. What caught Luka up was the name of the function: vvv. And not only was it a terrible name, thanks to the other dev's industriousness, it was now called all over the codebase. Even places where a more \"correct\" call had been used had been refactored to use this method. \"But it's so brief, and memorable,\" the developer said. Luka was vvvery upset by that attitude.

    "description": "\"We use a three tier architecture,\" said the tech lead on Cristian's new team. \"It helps us keep concerns separated.\" This statement, as it turned out, was half true. They did divide the application into three tiers- a \"database layer\", a \"business layer\", and a \"presentation layer\". The \"database layer\" was a bunch of Java classes. The \"business layer\" was a collection of Servlets. And the \"presentation layer\" was a pile of JSP files. What they didn't do, however, was keep the concerns separated. Here's some code from their database layer: public synchronized StringBuffer getStocTotGest(String den, String gest) { StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(\"\" + \"\" + \"\" + \"\" + \"\" + \"\"); try { ResultSetrs= connectionManager .executeQuery(\"select (if(length(SUBSTRING(den,1,instr(den,'(')-1))\u003e0,SUBSTRING(den,1,instr(den,'(')-1),den)) as den,um,pret_vinz,sum(stoc) as stoc from stmarfzi_poli where den like '\" + den + \"%' \" + gest + \" group by den order by den\"); while (rs.next()) { sb.append(\"\"); sb.append(\"\"); sb.append(\"\"); } sb.append(\"DenumireCantPretVanz \" + rs.getString(\"den\") + \"\" + threeDecimalPlacesFormat.format(rs.getDouble(\"stoc\")) + \" \" + rs.getString(\"um\") + \"\" + teoDecimalPlacesFormat.format(rs.getDouble(\"pret_vinz\")) + \"\"); } catch (Exception ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); } return sb; } I guess a sufficiently motivated programmer can write PHP in any language. This just has a little bit of everything in it, doesn't it? There's the string-munged HTML generation in the database layer. The HTML is also wrong, as header fields are output with td tags, instead of th. There's the SQL injection vulnerability. There's the more-or-less useless exception handler. It's synchronized even though it's not doing anything thread unsafe. It's truly a thing of beauty, at least if you don't know what beauty is and think it means something horrible. This function was used in a few places. It was called from a few servlets in the \"business layer\", where the resulting StringBuffer was dumped into a session variable so that JSP files could access it. At least, that was for the JSP files which didn't invoke the function themselves- JSP files which mixed all the various layers together. Cristian's first task in the code base was changing the background colors of all of the rendered table headers. Since, as you can see, they weren't using CSS to make this easy, that involved searching through the entire codebase, in every layer, to find all the places where maybe a table was generated. Changing those colors was Cristian's first task in the code base. I assume that Cristian is still working on that, and will be working on that for some time to come.
