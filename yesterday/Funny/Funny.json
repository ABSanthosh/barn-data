    "description": "If you've ever dreamed of meeting Garfield in real life, brace yourself  because the internet is full of feline floofs who look like they just walked out of a lasagna pan. These orange chonksters are serving up sass, side-eyes, and serious snack envy. With their big bellies, perpetually unimpressed faces, and a tendency to sprawl dramatically across any surface they deem nap-worthy, these cats are the purrfect real-life Garfield doppelgängers.Much like their cartoon counterpart, they seem to live by three rules: hate Mondays, love carbs, and nap like it's a full-time job. Whether they're glaring at the dog, knocking over your coffee in protest of being awake, or plotting their next fridge raid, these ginger goofballs are feline icons in the making.Some might say they're ameowzingly relatable, others might call them pawsitively lazy, but we call them purrfection. So grab some lasagna (or at least a snack), curl up on the couch, and enjoy these Garfield lookalikes living their best nine lives, one nap at a time.Fluff. Chaos. Drama!

We learned something new today, and it's not often that we learn something new about cats as someone who considers themselves an expurrt on all things feline-related. We love to write about unique cats because they're just so cool to look at (and awwdorable!), and today we found a new breed of cat that we had never heard of before - the Selkirk Rex! Actually, any cat breed with the name \"Rex\" in it should have some sort of curly-haired gene.These cats are born with a rare genetic mutation that causes their fur to be curly, and it is literally the cutest thing on the internet. No, they didn't just get back from the hairdresser - they were born this way! They look so soft and cuddly that even just scrolling through pictures of them wraps our hearts in a wholesome feline embrace. Give yourself a nice scroll and turn your day into a wholesome tangle of purrs thanks to these kitty cuties!Fluff. Chaos. Drama! Our weekly cat newsletter has it all -  subscribe here.",

    "description": "Welcome to the workplace dodgeball championship, where the performance never ends and the audience is always left holding the mop. The gameplay is predictable: vanish the cleaning supplies and someone else will handle the sanitizing; stash the gloves and magically avoid the restocking duty. The genius lies not in working less, but in crafting alibis so convincing that your negligence masquerades as misfortune or inventory mishaps.Workplaces are laboratories for the fine art of professional avoidance, where the most mundane duties become elaborate disappearing acts and storage areas double as crime scenes for missing supplies. In these environments, one skilled practitioner of strategic laziness can transform routine teamwork into an endless game of treasure hunt, leaving colleagues to clean up the chaos while maintaining the fiction that everything is business as usual.",

I'm a \"bad tipper.\" Perhaps it's the lack of service these days—with QR code menus, scant staffing, and tipping culture spiralling out of control—but I just don't see the value in tipping a server 25% just because of social obligation. I'm a Californian, which means that waiters and waitresses at my local establishments are likely scoring 6-figure salaries at the end of the year, raking in egregious tourism-bloated tips, while maintaining a high hourly wage. It's insane.So if a server isn't actually going above and beyond to serve my table, I'm not going above and beyond in the tipping section of the receipt.Plain and simple.This man also refused to leave a good tip for a bad waitress. While enjoying a date with his girlfriend, their table was forgotten, drink orders misplaced, and the waitresses attitude was bad from the start. But when he left a 10% obligation tip, she flipped out and publicly shamed him as a cheapskate. Perhaps she didn't deserve any tip whatsoever...",

They were not gentle, but they weren't overtly hostile: how have you used AI this week to accomplish your tasks? If you squint a little, you can see kind of a weird visage in the negative space. The newer ones I've seen are a little more like placing a loaded gun on the table before you speak. Why haven't you?

But let's just breeze past that into that colors lookup table, because boy oh boy. There's the obvious issue of using server-side code to manage colors instead of CSS, which is bad, sure. But this translation table which converts some colors (presumably already used in the display?) to some other colors (presumably to replace the display colors) is downright mystifying. How did this happen? Why did this happen? What happens when we attempt to apply a color not in the lookup table? I want to say more mean things about this, but the more I stare at the original colors and what they get translated to, I think this lookup table is trying to tell me I should… … … lighten up.

Fortunately for him, the vendor documentation told him that there was a method called obtainRowLock. obtainRowLock($table, $where) - Attempt to lock a row, will escalate and lock the table if row locking is not supported, will escalate and lock the database if table locking is not supported; returns true on success, false on failure $table - name of table to lock $where - WHERE clause to define rows, ex: \"WHERE id=52\". If left empty, function will assume a table lock That was exactly what Dan needed, so he called it. It returned false, implying a failure. He changed the parameters. He discarded his where clause. He tried all sorts of things, and it always returned false.
