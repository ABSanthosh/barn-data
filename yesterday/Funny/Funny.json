    "description": "In a world where cash is king, folks in the workforce have got to find ways to make an honest living without wearing themselves too thin. Being underpaid and overworked is a nightmare for most, especially when you're not even aware of the fact that you could be cashing out on a larger biweekly paycheck. That's why being up front with members of your team and in your field in general is something that shouldn't be taboo. Employers feed off the outdated etiquette of not speaking about money because it's deemed 'impolite'.If it weren't for salary transparency, the employee in this next story wouldn't have known they were being paid 25% less than the employee who was just recently hired. The employee who posted the story explains that they have nearly three years of experience at the company over the new hire, and refuses to believe that this isn't somewhat personal.In the comments section, fellow folks who serve the dollar explain the importance of leaving a company that no longer serves you, because companies believe everyone is replaceable. Well, if that's the case…",

Like, that's a well-known rule in wedding edict, right?… Apparently not! Sure, there are other cultures that say otherwise, but for a traditional American wedding, the kind you see in Hollywood rom-coms, it's pretty obvious that only the bride wears white, and if you show up in white you are the biggest entitled person ever. And yet, according to the plethora of stories online of people still showing up in white to weddings, this still tends to happen all of the time.  In this case, it's the mother of the groom who wants to show up in white. But not only in white, she wants to show up in the only two colors that her son specifically told her not to wear…",

And what better delivery mechanism for such energy than the rarely witnessed pawsitivty of cats. Known to usually be rather judgmental, juvenile and jealous creatures, joy is not often an emotion that we associate with our crazy cat children.But that is also what makes their joy so much more special and sweet when it does eerily rear its head after not being used for an extended period of time. Which is why we captured as much of that unbridled joy as we could and put it into this list of feel good feline funnies that will make a marvelous morning mood booster for all you hoomans who had a hard time getting into the office this morning.",

    "description": "We all know what being a cat pawrent is like - you love your cat children and will do anything for them. When you adopt a cat, you start living for them. And that's not a bad thing! Not at all. Living for a cat is a true blessing. You provide for the most adorable creature on Earth, and get to feel their feline love in return. And as a cat pawrent, you should already know that receiving a cat's love is the most wholesome thing in the world. Your cats look up to you, and you always want to make sure you give them what they need.But when you can't provide your beloved cat children what they need, it's a whole other story. One such cat mama got into a situation where she couldn't afford next month's cat food bag for her two adorable cat children. And let us tell you, from cat pawrents to other cat pawrents, if we were ever in a situation where we could not be certain we'd provide for our cute cat babies, we'd be very stressed. In an attempt to seek advice on what she can feed her cats until she can buy cat food, this cat mama turned to the online feline family for advice.What this cat mama didn't expect was the amount of love and care the online feline family would give her. Not only did she get what she asked for - practical advice on foods that can turn into feline food from things in her kitchen - but she got the wholesome support of other cat pawrents helping her with donations, advice, and warm words that felt like an online hug. Her cats will be okay and well fed - she has nothing to worry about anymore.",

Right now, AI is being shoe-horned into everything, whether or not it makes sense. To me, it feels like the dotcom boom again. Millipedes.com! Fungus.net! Business plan? What business plan? Just secure the domain names and crank out some Super Bowl ads. We'll be RICH! In fact, it's not just my feeling. The Large Language Model (LLM) OpenAI is being wildly overvalued and overhyped. It's hard to see how it will generate more revenue while its offerings remain underwhelming and unreliable in so many ways. Hallucination, bias, and other fatal flaws make it a non-starter for businesses like journalism that must have accurate output. Why would anyone convert to a paid plan? Even if there weren't an income problem—even if every customer became a paying customer—generative AI's exorbitant operational and environmental costs are poised to drown whatever revenue and funding they manage to scrape together. Lest we think the problem is contained to OpenAPI or LLMs, there's not a single profitable AI venture out there. And it's largely not helping other companies to be more profitable, either. A moment like this requires us to step back, take a deep breath. With sober curiosity, we gotta explore and understand AI's true strengths and weaknesses. More importantly, we have to figure out what we are and aren't willing to accept from AI, personally and as a society. We need thoughtful ethics and policies that protect people and the environment. We need strong laws to prevent the worst abuses. Plenty of us have already been victimized by the absence of such. For instance, one of my own short stories was used by Meta without permission to train their AI. The Worst of AI Sadly, it is all too easy to find appalling examples of all the ways generative AI is harming us. (For most of these, I'm not going to provide links because they don't deserve the clicks): We all know that person who no longer seems to have a brain of their own because they keep asking OpenAI to do all of their thinking for them. Deepfakes deliberately created to deceive people. Cheating by students. Cheating by giant corporations who are all too happy to ignore IP and copyright when it benefits them (Meta, ahem). Piles and piles of creepy generated content on platforms like Youtube and TikTok that can be wildly inaccurate. Scammy platforms like DataAnnotation, Mindrift, and Outlier that offer $20/hr or more for you to \"train their AI.\" Instead, they simply gather your data and inputs and ghost the vast majority of applicants. I tried taking DataAnnotation's test for myself to see what would happen; after all, it would've been nice to have some supplemental income while job hunting. After several weeks, I still haven't heard back from them. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) block job applications from ever reaching a human being for review. As my job search drags on, I feel like my life has been reduced to a tedious slog of keyword matching. Did I use the word \"collaboration\" somewhere in my resume? Pass. Did I use the word \"teamwork\" instead? Fail. Did I use the word \"collaboration,\" but the AI failed to detect it, as regularly happens? Fail, fail, fail some more. Frustrated, I and no doubt countless others have been forced to turn to other AIs in hopes of defeating those AIs. While algorithms battle algorithms, companies and unemployed workers are all suffering. Horrific, undeniable environmental destruction. Brace yourself: a 14 year-old killed himself with the encouragement of the chatbot he'd fallen in love with. I can only imagine how many more young people have been harmed and are being actively harmed right now. The Best of AI? As AI began to show up everywhere, as seemingly everyone from Google to Apple demanded that I start using it, I had initially responded with aversion and resentment. I never bothered with it, I disabled it wherever I could. When people told me to use it, I waved them off. My life seemed no worse for it. Alas, now AI completely saturates my days while job searching, bringing on even greater resentment. Thousands of open positions for AI-based startups! Thousands of companies demanding expertise in generative AI as if it's been around for decades. Well, gee, maybe my hatred and aversion is hurting my ability to get hired. Am I being a middle-aged Luddite here? Should I be learning more about AI (and putting it on my resume)? Wouldn't I be the bigger person to work past my aversion in order to learn about and highlight some of the ways we can use AI responsibly? I tried. I really tried. To be honest, I simply haven't found a single positive generative AI use-case that justifies all the harm taking place. So, What Do We Do? Here are some thoughts: don't invest in generative AI or seek a job within the field, it's all gonna blow. Lobby your government to investigate abuses, protect people, and preserve the environment. Avoid AI usage and, if you're a writer like me, make clear that AI is not used in any part of your process. Gently encourage that one person you know to start thinking for themselves again. Most critically of all: wherever AI must be used for the time being, ensure that one or more humans review the results. li { margin: 0.5em; list-style: circle } [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.

    "description": "Loading times for web pages is one of the key metrics we like to tune. Users will put up with a lot if they feel like they application is responsive. So when Caivs was handed 20MB of PHP and told, \"one of the key pages takes like 30-45 seconds to load. Figure out why,\" it was at least a clear goal. Combing through that gigantic pile of code to try and understand what was happening was an uphill battle. Eventually, Caivs just decided to check the traffic logs while running the application. That highlighted a huge spike in traffic every time the page loaded, and that helped Caivs narrow down exactly where the problem was. $first_image = ''; foreach($images as $the_image) { $image = $the_image['url']; if(file_exists($config-\u003ebase_url.'/uploads/'.$image)) { if($first_image=='') { $first_image = $image; } $image_dimensions = '\u0026w=648\u0026h=432'; $get_dimensions = getimagesize('http://old.datacenter.ip.address/'.$config-\u003ebase_url.'/uploads/'.$image); if($get_dimensions[0] \u003c $get_dimensions[1]) $image_dimensions = '\u0026h=432'; echo ''.$config-\u003ebase_url.'/timthumb.php?src='.$config-\u003ebase_url.'/uploads/'.$image.'\u0026w=125\u0026h=80\u0026zc=1'), 'javascript:;', array('onclick'=\u003e'$(\\'.image_gallery .feature .image\\').html(\\''.$config-\u003ebase_url.'/timthumb.php?src='.$config-\u003ebase_url.'/uploads/'.$image.$image_dimensions.'\u0026zc=1').'\\');$(\\'.image_gallery .feature .title\\').show();$(\\'.image_gallery .feature .title\\').html(\"'.str_replace('\"', '', $the_image['Image Description']).'\");$(\\'.image_gallery .bar ul li a\\').removeClass(\\'active\\');$(\\'.image_gallery .bar ul li\\').removeClass(\\'active\\');$(this).addClass(\\'active\\');$(this).parents(\\'li\\').addClass(\\'active\\');sidebarHeight();curImg=$(this).attr(\\'id\\');translate()','id'=\u003e$img_num)).''; $img_num++; } } For every image they want to display in a gallery, they echo out a list item for it, which that part makes sense- more or less. The mix of PHP, JavaScript, JQuery, and HTML tags is ugly and awful and I hate it. But that's just a prosaic kind of awful, background radiation of looking at PHP code. Yes, it should be launched into the Kupier belt (it doesn't deserve the higher delta-V required to launch it into the sun), but that's not why we're here. The cause of the long load times was in the lines above- where for each image, we getimagesize- a function which downloads the image and checks its stats, all so we can set $image_dimensions. Which, presumably, the server hosting the images uses the query string to resize the returned image. All this is to check- if the height is greater than the width we force the height to be 432 pixels, otherwise we force the whole image to be 648x432 pixels. Now, the server supplying those images had absolutely no caching, so that meant for every image request it needed to resize the image before sending. And for reasons which were unclear, if the requested aspect ratio were wildly different than the actual aspect ratio, it would also sometimes just refused to resize and return a gigantic original image file. But someone also had thought about the perils of badly behaved clients downloading too many images, so if a single host were requesting too many images, it would start throttling the responses. When you add all this up, it meant that this PHP web application was getting throttled by its own file server, because it was requesting too many images, too quickly. Any reasonable user load hitting it would be viewed as an attempted denial of service attack on the file hosting backend. Caivs was able to simply remove the check on filesize, and add a few CSS rules which ensured that files in the gallery wouldn't misbehave terribly. The performance problems went away- at least for that page of the application. Buried in that 20MB of PHP/HTML code, there were plenty more places where things could go wrong.
