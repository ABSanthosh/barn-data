    "description": "For some reason, both of our youngest wanted to watch Scream on Halloween separately. Even from the jump, it might not scare them, but there is a… cruelty in some of these older horror movies that must have been surprising even if it's not jump-scare scary. Scream in particular is a weird movie; not in a bad way, but it's doing some genre examination while it executes a strong premise. I'm sort of a horror fan, if the last couple sentences didn't give it away. Gabriel is, well, not.",

You are as a fanatic feline fan as us, so you probably already know the answer we're about to give - lots and lots of cat memes.Cat memes in the morning before you leave for work, cat memes at noon when you take your lunch break, cat memes on the way back commuting, cat memes before you go to sleep, cat memes together with your cat. Cat memes all day, every day, all day long. You see the cat memes, the cat memes make you laugh, and even meow. Meow meow meow meow meow.

If you're lucky, they're around for the next 20 years, which is both ameowzing and kind of scary at the same time! 20 years is a long time to commit to something, heck, we can't even commitment to making dinner plans for later this week! But, when the cat distribution system comes a knock-knock-knocking, you answer, and it's purrfectly understandable to have fears about taking in a new fuzzy family member.On a cross-country road trip, one dog lover (ew, we know) rescued a tiny orange kitten while at a gas station, and after a few days, the responsibility of it all started to sink in. The heartwarming cat community came to his rescue to purrfectly save him from himself, by helping him get through his fears of loving his new fuzzy family member for such a long time. Cat people are the best, aren't they? People helping people, helping cats, helping the world be a better place - it's pawsitively the best thing you might read this Tuesday. In fact, we're sure of it!",

    "description": "If you do your job too well, you're simply going to make everyone else look bad by comparison. Instead of earning yourself the praise you deserve, you actually just wind up putting a target on your back while everyone quietly wishes you'd just disappear and stop making all of their jobs harder by setting the bar so high. Usually, your boss won't just come right out and tell you to stop working so hard or being so competent, saying the quiet part out loud would only make them and the team look worse.This customer support worker, who works from home, was doing so well that their boss broke that rule and flat-out told them that they needed to stop taking so many gosh-dang calls. They abided and had such a sharp reduction in calls answered that it triggered a performance review, which then landed them back in an \"in training\" status. This meant that they were at the direct order of their team leader, who, not noting their status change, failed to assign them any work. This meant that they were basically free to do whatever they pleased while they waited for this all to blow over.",

    "description": "This coworker has a weird fixation. For some strange reason, he cannot stop thinking about his coworker's college degree. And he isn't just thinking about it: he's been constantly bugging them about it. This is an odd story, because unless you work in academia, almost no one cares about your college degree. It matters that you went to a college and graduated with a degree for many high-paying jobs. Usually, the hiring manager or HR team will determine that kind of information before hiring you. But apparently there's a decent amount of people who just straight-up lie about their college degrees during interviews! If they can still get jobs that way, then clearly the degree isn't all that's needed to succeed in the workplace. A lot of your successes will be built on good communication, savvy networking, and being known as a competent and skilled individual. This person's coworker has a really weird fixation on their college degree, which makes him look petty and weird. You can check out the full tale below, as well as read the advice from the commenters who were shaking their head at this guy's audacity. Up next, check out some really awkward reasons people gave for breaking up with their significant others, like one person who \"said they needed to 'focus on their plants.'\"",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/counting-it-all",
    "description": "Since it's election day in the US, many people are thinking about counting today. We frequently discuss counting here, and how to do it wrong, so let's look at some code from RK. This code may not be counting votes, but whatever it's counting, we're not going to enjoy it: case LogMode.Row_limit: // row limit excel = 65536 rows if (File.Exists(personalFolder + @\"\\\" + fileName + \".CSV\")) { using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(personalFolder + @\"\\\" + fileName + \".CSV\")) { countRows = reader.ReadToEnd().Split(new char[] { '\\n' }).Length; } } Now, this code is from a rather old application, originally released in 2007. So the comment about Excel's row limit really puts us in a moment in time- Excel 2007 raised the row limit to 1,000,000 rows. But older versions of Excel did cap out at 65,536. And it wasn't the case that everyone just up and switched to Excel 2007 when it came out- transitioning to the new Office file formats was a conversion which took years. But we're not even reading an Excel file, we're reading a CSV. I enjoy that we construct the name twice, because that's useful. But the real magic of this one is how we count the rows. Because while Excel can handle 65,536 rows at this time, I don't think this program is going to do a great job of it- because we read the entire file into memory with ReadToEnd, then Split on newlines, then count the length that way. As you can imagine, in practice, this performed terribly on large files, of which there were many. Unfortunately for RK, there's one rule about old, legacy code: don't touch it. So despite fixing this being a rather easy task, nobody is working on fixing it, because nobody wants to be the one who touched it last. Instead, management is promising to launch a greenfield replacement project any day now… [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.

    "description": "For years, Victoria had a co-worker who \"programmed by Google Search\"; they didn't understand how anything worked, they simply plugged their problem into Google search and then copy/pasted and edited until they got code that worked. For this developer, I'm sure ChatGPT has been a godsend, but this code predates its wide use. It's pure \"Googlesauce\". StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer(); stringBuffer.append(\"SELECT * FROM TABLE1 WHERE COLUMN1 = 1 WITH UR\"); String sqlStr = stringBuffer.toString(); ps = getConnection().prepareStatement(sqlStr); ps.setInt(1, code); rs = ps.executeQuery(); while (rs.next()) { count++; } The core of this WTF isn't anything special- instead of running a SELECT COUNT they run a SELECT and then loop over the results to get the count. But it's all the little details in here which make it fun. They start by using a StringBuffer to construct their query- not a horrible plan when the query is long, but this is just a single, simple, one-line query. The query contains a WITH clause, but it's in the wrong spot. Then they prepareStatement it, which does nothing, since this query doesn't contain any parameters (and also, isn't syntactically valid). Once it's prepared, they set the non-existent parameter 1 to a value- this operation will throw an exception because there are no parameters in the query. Finally, they loop across the results to count. The real WTF is that this code ended up in the code base, somehow. The developer said, \"Yes, this seems good, I'll check in this non-functional blob that I definitely don't understand,\" and then there were no protections in place to keep that from happening. Now it falls to more competent developers, like Victoria, to clean up after this co-worker.
