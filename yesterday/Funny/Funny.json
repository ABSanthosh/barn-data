    "description": "Being a second-semester senior in high school can feel pretty pointless. After all, you have worked tirelessly for three-and-a-half years only to find yourself having to take more classes and assessments. On top of that, you probably have already figured out your future at this point, so you are truly \"one step in and one step out.\" Maybe you're making your college plans or you have a job lined up. Regardless, it can feel useless to take more classes where the grades don't really lead to anything.Now, you may be asking yourself: \"what about the magic of learning?\" If we want to fulfill our students in that way, we should reconsider our entire approach to that final semester. Perhaps we should allow all students to pursue independent studies so that they are still in school but they are also pursuing intellectual engagement and fulfillment in subject they are actually interested in… just a thought!Keep scrolling below for this student's second-semester senior drama!",

Perhaps if you live somewhere that isn't too populated and you can go at some random hour of the day, then fine, yes, it is probably very peaceful for you. But for the rest of us who only has time to go grocery shopping during the hours that everyone else has to go, it is stressful. The aisles are full, check-out lines are long, and have of the things on your list are sold out. It's frustrating and overwhelming. So you try to stay focused, bring a shopping list, and go on your own or with one other partner to help out—any more and it becomes extra stressful.  No imagine you go during shopping rush hour and you decide to bring you partner, kids, in-laws, cousins, and kids' friends. What?… Why?? Why would you do that? What is the point?? All that is going to do is cause extra stress for you, because now you are a host/babysitter, and you are just adding even more to the shopping rush hour that makes shoppers so overwhelmed. And yet, people actually do that, and stand in aisle like it's their own living room…",

He snuggles up next to you, in his fluffy feline fashion, sending one of his front legs towards you and paws you gently. Isn't that just the cutest, most wholesome thing a cat pawrent can expurrience? Just a smol touch of a cat's paw. It can change a day's mood, it can make any humble hooman happy for a long time. It's like a tiny imprint of bliss.We want to help any hooman experience this meowgnificent moment, even if they're not cat pawrents - so we turned to the next best thing, which is also so easy to transfer to any feline fan - cat memes. And not just any cat memes - toe beans and paws. These memes are like a cat pawing at you gently, wholesome but full of humor all hoomans can harvest.",

To be fair, that's what we want to do every day, but especially on this cold, wintery Tuesday. If we could pick our purrfect cuddle puddle, it would be with a family of cheetahs. It would be like cuddling with a great dane, but better, because it would be a giant cat that meows and purrs. Just imagine how soft it would be. Just imagine purrs from a 120 lb. cat…it must be meowgical. Now, multiply that by three, and you've successfully managed to expurrience what the hooman guard in this video gets to enjoy every night. He guards a family of cheetahs at a wildlife reserve, and while sleeping under the stars, the large feline family snuck in for a cuddle puddle overnight, showcasing the heartwarming connections pawssible between hoomans and animals. We're not just awwwww-ing over this, we're also pawsitively jealous. Scroll down to watch the wholesome video below!",

For example, if you are A Russo Brother - either one - I would absolutely love it if they came back and made a cool Marvel movie. Disney certainly doesn't know how. Disney has been wandering in the fucking woods since Endgame, and the movie that called them out for doing exactly that made 1.3 billion dollars. I want these Russo gentlemen back because they made Captain America: Winter Soldier. That's why I wanted them to do the other stuff; because they make good things. I don't need some kind of substrate underneath it. It's a craft. They're the masters of it. That's plenty for me.",

During the negotiations, he asked some questions about the design, like, \"Is it object-oriented or more procedural?\" \"No, it's PHP,\" said the developer. Which about sums it up, I suppose. Have some date handling code: function MnameToMnumber($mname) //takes month name 'January' and returns month number '01' { if($mname == 'January'){$mnum = '01';} elseif($mname == 'February'){$mnum = '02';} elseif($mname == 'March'){$mnum = '03';} elseif($mname == 'April'){$mnum = '04';} elseif($mname == 'May'){$mnum = '05';} elseif($mname == 'June'){$mnum = '06';} elseif($mname == 'July'){$mnum = '07';} elseif($mname == 'August'){$mnum = '08';} elseif($mname == 'September'){$mnum = '09';} elseif($mname == 'October'){$mnum = '10';} elseif($mname == 'November'){$mnum = '11';} elseif($mname == 'December'){$mnum = '12';} return $mnum; } function MnumberToMname($mname) //takes month number '01' and returns month name '01' { if($mnum= '01'){$mname = 'January';} elseif($mnum= '02'){$mname = 'February';} elseif($mnum= '03'){$mname = 'March';} elseif($mname == 'April'){$mnum = '04';} elseif($mnum= '05'){$mname = 'May';} elseif($mnum= '06'){$mname = 'June';} elseif($mnum= '07'){$mname = 'July';} elseif($mnum= '08'){$mname = 'August';} elseif($mnum= '09'){$mname = 'September';} elseif($mnum= '10'){$mname = 'October';} elseif($mnum= '11'){$mname = 'November';} elseif($mnum= '12'){$mname = 'December';} return $mname; } So, for starters, I \"love\" the use of Whitesmiths indenting. I don't think I've seen this in the wild. (I predict the comments section will be links to articles where I have seen this in the wild). Beyond that, there's nothing terribly surprising here, in terms of bad date handling code, with a few small exceptions. First is their insistence on the conversion itself being stringly typed: January isn't month 1, but \"01\". But more notable: MnumberToMname just doesn't work. They're using the assignment operator instead of the equality operator. At least, for all the cases where they're doing the correct comparison direction. A stray \"name to number\" conversion is lurking in April. Not that it matters- this will always return January. [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod.
