    "description": "Let's face it: paying rent stinks. It's like setting a pile of money on fire every week just for the privilege of surviving and oddly reminiscent of paying mob dues. You have virtually no rights to the home, along with virtually no guarantees, and in a lot of places, you can basically be asked to leave or pay more arbitrarily at virtually any point. Still, if you're fortunate enough to have a place of your own, you'll come to find that you're basically still just renting from the bank anyway, paying more in interest at the start of your mortgage than you have ever paid in rent, but at least you're not going to be asked to move without defaulting on your payments.Anyways, while paying your landlord's mortgage hurts, and as bad of a rap as landlords might have, it would be insane to just suddenly go around acting like you own the place and attempt to wrench control of the property from them. The reality is that whatever side of privilege they're on and from whatever walk of life, entitled people will be entitled and try to take advantage of any situation presented to them.",

    "description": "The internet is totally divided: did this person handle their surprise party the right way, or were they totally out of line? It all depends who you ask, according to the commenters on this story from u/noparty4me88. As you can guess from their username, this person does not like parties for themself. They mention that they didn't ever have parties for their own birthdays, not even the major birthdays that often get large celebrations like their sweet 16 or their 21st. Some people just don't like all that attention. Instead of enjoying the party, they just get nervous that everyone is celebrating them, and find all that socializing to be way too much to handle. This person really insisted that they did not want a birthday party under any circumstances. But their family still threw them one! Commenters couldn't agree on how this person handled the situation, though, with some calling the original poster insensitive. Others thought that this person had every right to walk away from a party they so clearly communicated they didn't want. However, in the real world, this person's family will probably think they're in the wrong for fleeing their party. After all, the family members dedicated a day to celebrating this person, only to show up to a party with no host… Check out the full story below and see which side of the debate you end up on. After that, read about this bad neighbor who claimed he'd tattle to the city if his neighbor didn't get his collapsed fence fixed up.",

All we have to get us through our whiskery weary workdays are our coffee orders every meowrning, our cats to come home to, and our furvorite shows that we watch over and over again because nothing will ever be better than them. That's why, even though fresh cat memes are made daily on the ever-evolving internet, we still prefer the classics. Those timeless cat memes that, no matter how many times you view them, still make you giggle.Since their creation, cat memes have been one of the joys in our lives. We knew immediately that the cat can haz cheezburger, and that we never saw a \"woman yelling at cat\" meme that we didn't burst out into laughter with. It's like watching Avatar: The Last Airbender every year, it just makes us happy. The world may be always changing around us, but memes are furrever on the internet for us to enjoy whenever we want. And when we're having a tough workday, they never fail to help the time zoomie by!",

But to abandon it? On the street? Alone? Unacceptable. There are so many other solutions. You could find the cat a new family, or you could bring it to a shelter. Anything except leaving it in a carrier outside - confused, alone and terrified - and hoping that someone will just pop up and pick them up.Sadly, that's exactly what happened in today's story. This adorable cat was abandoned by its previous owners. It is sheer luck - or maybe the Cat Distribution System performed some of its magic - that sent these wonderful people to save this cat. As angry as we are about the people who abandoned this precious kitty, we are a million times more thankful to the ones who rescued it and worked so hard and for so long to gain its trust.",

Even from the jump, it might not scare them, but there is a… cruelty in some of these older horror movies that must have been surprising even if it's not jump-scare scary. Scream in particular is a weird movie; not in a bad way, but it's doing some genre examination while it executes a strong premise. I'm sort of a horror fan, if the last couple sentences didn't give it away. Gabriel is, well, not.",

    "description": "For years, Victoria had a co-worker who \"programmed by Google Search\"; they didn't understand how anything worked, they simply plugged their problem into Google search and then copy/pasted and edited until they got code that worked. For this developer, I'm sure ChatGPT has been a godsend, but this code predates its wide use. It's pure \"Googlesauce\". StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer(); stringBuffer.append(\"SELECT * FROM TABLE1 WHERE COLUMN1 = 1 WITH UR\"); String sqlStr = stringBuffer.toString(); ps = getConnection().prepareStatement(sqlStr); ps.setInt(1, code); rs = ps.executeQuery(); while (rs.next()) { count++; } The core of this WTF isn't anything special- instead of running a SELECT COUNT they run a SELECT and then loop over the results to get the count. But it's all the little details in here which make it fun. They start by using a StringBuffer to construct their query- not a horrible plan when the query is long, but this is just a single, simple, one-line query. The query contains a WITH clause, but it's in the wrong spot. Then they prepareStatement it, which does nothing, since this query doesn't contain any parameters (and also, isn't syntactically valid). Once it's prepared, they set the non-existent parameter 1 to a value- this operation will throw an exception because there are no parameters in the query. Finally, they loop across the results to count. The real WTF is that this code ended up in the code base, somehow. The developer said, \"Yes, this seems good, I'll check in this non-functional blob that I definitely don't understand,\" and then there were no protections in place to keep that from happening. Now it falls to more competent developers, like Victoria, to clean up after this co-worker.

Imagine the performance gain!   \"This sounds about right,\" says Colin A.   \"Wow! Must snap up some sweet Anker kit with this amazing offer; but less than four days to go!\" exclaims Dave L., who then goes on to explain \"The actual WTF is this though. I sent this image to Anker with this email: But only 3days left? I hope this offer continues! Anker replied: Thank you for your feedback! I understand that you appreciate the savings on the Anker SOLIX PS100 Portable Solar Panel and wish the offer could be extended beyond the current 3-day limit. Your suggestion is valuable and will be considered for future promotions to enhance customer satisfaction. If you have any other requests or need further assistance, please let me know. I for one welcome our new AI overlords. \"   Graham F. almost stashed this away for later. \"Looks like Dropbox could use a few lessons in how to do Maths! Although maybe their definition of 'almost' differs from mine.\"   Finally Joshua found time to report a brand-new date-handling bug. \"Teams is so buggy; this one just takes the cake. I had to check with the unix cal program to make sure I wasn't completely bonkers.\" For the readers, November 8 this year is supposed to be a Friday. I suppose things could change after the US election.   Have a great weekend. Maybe I'll see you next Friday, or maybe all the weekdays will be renamed Thursday.
