    "description": "Office life comes with its share of annoyances: that one person who microwaves fish, the colleague who tells the same story daily, and the printer that works exclusively through prayer. But nothing quite compares to the special torment of dealing with an entitled child using the workplace as their personal playground while their parent watches with the observational skills of a brick wall. It's a uniquely torturous situation where professional adults suddenly find themselves playing unwilling, and unpaid babysitters, forced to protect their belongings like they're guarding the crown jewels from a tiny, runny-nosed, sticky-fingered bandit. Everyone has to tiptoe around the (t)issue because confronting a parent about their precious angel's behavior is about as pleasant as getting a root canal while listening to the same kid practice the bagpipe. The workplace transforms into a bizarre combination of daycare and maximum security facility, with employees hiding their possessions and developing elaborate systems to protect their lunch from becoming another casualty of a child's communist philosophy.",

    "description": "Is it true that \"Parents just don't parent anymore?\" Some people think that after reading this person's airplane story: they had the most annoying flight ever, thanks to some very young children who were allowed to run wild. What is it about travel that brings out the worst in people? Is it the stress of getting to your flight on time while carrying your heavy luggage? By the time you get to your gate, you're already cranky and hungry, so then you have to pay a small fortune to eat awful airport food. For the parents who are traveling with children, their kids are going to start asking to go to the bathroom, whining about wanting to go home, telling them they're bored, and running laps around the gate. Some kids will start crying and carrying on before they've even set foot on the aircraft! By the time their flight gets delayed once or twice, and they board as slowly as humanly possible, those kids are crawling up the walls. Bringing something to occupy them during the flight is starting to sound like a good idea! Up next, read about some people whose giant mistakes got them immediately fired, like one person whose mistake caused \"total damage [that] was almost $1,000,000.\"",

    "description": "Hey there, cat pawrents. If you've ever adopted a kitten, you know that they are both fluffy, sweet little angels, and also purrfessional life-destroyers at the same time. One second, they're snuggled up on your chest, snoozing away, and then a few hours later (specifically at night), they're running around your house breaking literally everything pawssible. It's a lot. And the energy is never ending. This is why we always tell people to do their research before adopting a kitten, and even then it can't fully prepaw you for the chaos that will come.The only way out is through, so you just have to live through it and know that it will get better. Now, some kittens are easier than others. The really hard ones make you question your reality, and even force you to consider rehoming your tiny baby. After being sleep deprived for the last couple of months, one such feline pawrent was at their limit. They asked the internet for advice, and what they received was not quite what they expected. Scroll down to see how they solved it below!",

    "description": "There's nothing funnier in the meme sphere more than cat memes. Yes, yes, we're aware there are other memes that are funny, we do not deny reality. But there's something special about cat memes. They're not only funny, as most memes are (or at least as some memes are) - they also have cats. And if it was not clear up until this point - we're very much in the opinion that cats make everything better. Even memes. You have a meme, you make it with a cat, and it's instantly better than it was before. Cat memes are simply the best.Since cat memes are the funniest, they are the best kind of memes, we want to share as much of them with as many people as we can. This is why we prepared this comedic compound of cat comedy made of 22 funny feline memes. All these feline funnies are really making us laugh here like no other kind of meme. Can we agree at least that cat memes are cute?",

    "description": "There are real advantages to taking a functional programming approach to expressing problems. Well, some problems, anyway. Kevin sends us this example of elegant, beautiful functional code in C#: //create a range of dates List dates = Enumerable.Range (0, 1 + settings.EndDate.Subtract (settings.BeginDate).Days).Select (offset =\u003e settings.BeginDate.AddDays(offset)).ToList(); foreach (DateTime procDate in dates) { /*.snip.*/ } If you're not sure what this code does, it's okay- Kevin rewrote it and \"ruined\" it: DateTime procDate = settings.BeginDate; while(procDate \u003c= settings.EndDate) { /*.snip.*/ procDate= procDate.AddDays(1); } The goal of this code is simply to do something for every day within a range of dates. These two approaches vary a bit in terms of readability though. I guess the loop in the functional version isn't mutating anything, I suppose. But honestly, I'm surprised that this didn't take the extra step of using the .ForEach function (which takes a lambda and applies it to each parameter). Heck, with that approach, they could have done this whole thing in a single statement.

It contained this single function: function document_write(s) { document.write(s); } Now, setting aside the fact that document.write is one of those \"you probably shouldn't use this\" functions, and is deprecated, one has to wonder what the point of this function is. Did someone really not like object-oriented style code? Did someone break the \".\" on their keyboard and just wanted to not have to copy/paste existing \".\"s? It's the kind of function you expect to see that someone wrote but that isn't invoked anywhere, and you'd almost be correct. This function, in a file included on every page, is called once and only once. More like the wrong helper, if we're being honest. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.
