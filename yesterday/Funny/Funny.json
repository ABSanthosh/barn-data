Having a good neighbor is great, but having a neighbor to feud with and complain about on Reddit is amazing—truly.Folks like to convince themselves they're entitled to things that don't belong to them… even driveways that are owned by their neighbors. We've not posted about Karens in quite a bit, but we think the one in this story takes the cake.This homeowner is told by their Karen neighbor to move their car from their own driveway because it's 'ruining' the view she has from her porch.

These complaints aren't just cliché—they're an ancient rite of passage, a way for adults to process the unavoidable truth that nobody on earth would choose to have a roommate if rent weren't more terrifying than the roommate themselves. Let's face it: deep down, everyone just wants (or rather, is brutally forced by their bank account) to have another human around to halve the pain of paying for shelter.",

    "description": "The bond between a hooman and their favorite cat will never break, even if that kitty is not actually yours. Finding a stray on the street is always a heartbreaking experience for a cat lover. Desperately skinny, meowing for help, and likely covered in indignant clouds of dirt, outdoor cats cling to the nearest hooman servant, hoping for a cuddle, a pet, or even a tin of tuna to aid their kitty quest. But not every cat out there is on some kind of quest; in fact, many cats simply get lost, hoping to find their way home somehow. But when you're sharing a brain cell with your other kitty brethren, finding home all by your lonesome isn't so easy. So when this kind hooman found a lost cat out in the wild, she gleefully brought it under her wing. However, less than 24 hours later, and after sleeping on the bathroom floor with her new favorite cat, the original owner was found. What's a cat lover to do? Well, the \"right thing,\" of course.",

    "description": "Hey there, pawrents of the internet. We know you know how lucky you are, but it never hurts to be reminded. We get to experience the meowgical beings that are cats literally every day - we get to cuddle with them, see them as they make adorable airplane ears, and simply bask in their cat-like glory. Not only that, but having deemed ourselves worthy of their love, we get to be loved by them. And that, dear friends, is the greatest gift of all.There is no love like a cat's love. Dogs love everyone and they aren't afraid to show it. Cats are picky about the hoomans they love, and once you're chosen, you're chosen for life. Sure, they might get a little grumpy if you feed them late too many times, but they will be yours furever despite it all. We found a heartwarming helping of lovestruck felines that we just had to share with you, to remind you how lucky we are to be so loved by our cat companions. Enjoy!",

It is not something we look forward to no matter which state you live in. A few years ago Texas introduced an online portal for this which was an improvement, if you didn't wait until the last minute of course. Recently they added a feature to the portal to track the progress of your renewal and see when they mail the sticker to you. I was pleasantly surprised to see the status page.\"   [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds. Learn more.",

    "description": "DZ's tech lead is a doctor of computer science, and that doctor loves to write code. But you already know that \"PhD\" stands for \"Piled high and deep\", and that's true of the tech lead's clue. For example, in C#: private List ExtractListForId(string id) { List list = new List(); lock (this) { var items = _foos.Where(f =\u003e f.Id == id).ToList(); foreach (var item in items) { list.Add(item); } } return list; } The purpose of this function is to find all the elements in a list where they have a matching ID. That's accomplished in one line: _foo.Where(f =\u003e f.Id == id). For some reason, the function goes through the extra step of iterating across the returned list and constructing a new one. There's no real good reason for this, though it does force LINQ to be eager- by default, the Where expression won't be evaluated until you check the results. The lock is in there for thread safety, which hey- the enumerator returned by Where is not threadsafe, so that's not a useless thing to do there. But it's that lock which hints at the deeper WTF here: our PhD-having-tech-lead knows that adding threads ensures you're using more of the CPU, and they've thrown threads all over the place without any real sense to it. There's no clear data ownership of any given thread, which means everything is locked to hell and back, the whole thing frequently deadlocks, and it's impossible to debug. It's taken days for DZ to get this much of a picture of what's going on in the code, and further untangling of this multithreaded pile of spaghetti is going to take many, many more days- and much, much more of DZ's sanity.
