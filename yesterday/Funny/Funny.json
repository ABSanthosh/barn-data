    "description": "When you first start working in the career field of your dreams, you have to tread lightly. Like in every field, your first few jobs might not be your best fit. You might not like what you are actually being assigned to do, you might not vibe well with your coworkers or higher ups, or you might just be figuring out that you'd rather be following a different career path. Just because you have all of these snags, does not mean you should burn those bridges. You never know when you are going to have to work with those people again! And that's not even on a career later climbing level, that's just on a human level. What if that coworker you hate coincidentally takes the same job pivot as you and now you're back in the interview room and they are the ones doing the hiring process? You never know!  Here, you can see the most perfect example of a boss making the wrong move on a brand new employee and it coming back to haunt him in the future.",

Sure, the physical bond might be instant with mothers and eventually fathers, but the emotional and mental bond needs to be feed like watering a plant. It's important to learn about your child and for your child to learn about you as a human being, not just as a family member. So, that is why little outings with your kiddos is important.  This dad decided to take his 7-year-old to some fun Canada Day activities. They had a great time and he felt it was great for bonding. But it wasn't until they were leaving that the bonding took place with a life lesson.",

    "description": "Unfortunately, we know that we cannot adopt every cat that we see. We want to, but there is a limit. That doesn't mean that we can't help as many cats as possible. TNR - trap–neuter–return - oftentimes, this is the best solution. If you see a stray cat that is struggling, and you want to help, one of the best things that you can do for them is take them to a vet and help them get better. And although we know that not everyone can do this either, we certainly encourage as many people as possible to do it if they can. That is what this person thought they were going to do - they just wanted to give this cat a quick TNR, and that is it. But the cat was too sick to be left outside again. It would not have survived on its own out there. So, this rescuer took it as a sign… that this cat was meant to be theirs. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

When you have a live-in floofy emperor who dictates what you do, when you do it, and exactly how you do it - life becomes much easier.Some people may ask themselves \"Isn't it a crazy schedule to adhere to? Wouldn't it be too much to constantly go on a whim of someone else?\", and we say to these people a loud, clear, meowing \"No!\". Living with a cat makes everything better. Why would we mind putting \"Cute cuddling time\" or \"Snuggling meeting\" into our calendars? Who would refuse that?Having more cats in your life is never bad. On the contrary - it's the best thing a person can achieve. This is why being a Crazy Cat Lady is actually a compliment, never an insult. So, when you need more cats in your life? We usually turn to consuming cute cat memes. It's floofing funny, and brings more cat joy into your life.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

    "description": "Sometimes, you see some code which is perfectly harmless, but illustrates an incredibly dangerous person behind them. The code isn't good, but it isn't bad in any meaningful way, but they were written by a cocaine addled pomeranian behind the controls of a bulldozer: it's full of energy, doesn't know exactly what's going on, and at some point, it's going to hit something important. Such is the code which Román sends us. public static function registerUser($name, $lastName, $username, ...) { // 100% unmodified first lines, some comments removed $tsCreation = new DateTime(); $user = new User(); $name = $name; $lastname = $lastName; $username = $username; $user-\u003esetUsername($username); $user-\u003esetLastname($lastname); $user-\u003esetName($name); // And so on. } This creates a user object and populates its fields. It doesn't use a meaningful constructor, which is its own problem, but that's not why we're here. We're here because for some reason the developer behind this function assigns some of the parameters to themselves. Why? I don't know, but it's clearly the result of some underlying misunderstanding of how things work. But the real landmine is the $lastname variable- which is an entirely new variable which has slightly different capitalization from $lastName. And you've all heard this song many times, so sing along with the chorus: \"this particular pattern shows up all through the codebase,\" complete with inconsistent capitalization. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.

    "description": "It's not unusual to store format templates in your application configuration files. I'd argue it's probably a good and wise thing to do. But Phillip inherited a C# application from a developer woh \"abandoned\" it, and there were some choices in there. \u003cappSettings\u003e \u003cadd key=\"xxxurl\" value=\"[http://{1}:7777/pls/xxx/p_pristjek?i_type=MK3000{0}i_ean={3}{0}i_style=http://{2}/Content/{0}i_red=http://{2}/start.aspx/]http://{1}:7777/pls/xxx/p_pristjek?i_type=MK3000{0}i_ean={3}{0}i_style=http://{2}/Content/{0}i_red=http://{2}/start.aspx\"/\u003e appSettings\u003e Okay, I understand that this field contains URLs, but I don't understand much else about what's going on here. It's unreadable, but also, it has some URLs grouped inside of a [] pair, but others which aren't, and why oh why does the {0} sigil keep showing up so much? Maybe it'll make more sense after we fill in the template? var url = string.Format(xxxUrl, \"\u0026\", xxxIp, srvUrl, productCode); Oh. It's an \"\u0026\". Because we're constructing a URL query string, which also seems to contain URLs, which I suspect is going to have some escaping issues, but it's for a query string. At first, I was wondering why they did this, but then I realized: they were avoiding escape characters. By making the ampersand a formatting parameter, they could avoid the need to write \u0026 everywhere. Which… I guess this is a solution? Not a good solution, but… a solution. I still don't know why the same URL is stored twice in the string, once surrounded by square brackets and once not, and I don't think I want to know. Only bad things can result from knowing that.
