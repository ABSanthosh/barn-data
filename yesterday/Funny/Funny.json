    "description": "We all know those beautiful and moving videos of parents surprising their step-children with adoption papers, as they become their official parents for life. Creating this combined family should be a wonderful and exciting thing that every single member of the family wants. This means that you cannot force it to happen–it must happen naturally, with the approval of both the children and the parents.If you try to force the unification of two families, you should not be surprised if you are met with pushback, especially with young children. When kids are forced to accept a new parent to their family, without giving them a chance to properly say goodbye to the parent they lost, or without the chance to connect to the new addition–it is simply not going to work. Not only will it cause them to push back on the new parent, but it will also drive them away from the existing one, and if you don't believe me, the next story will surely prove my point.",

    "description": "Workplaces managed to find a way to let their employees work remotely in the beginning of this decade. Now, that was necessary to ensure the safety of every employee that worked in close quarters with others. The explosion of remote work proved that a lot (if not all) of an employee's tasks could be completely remotely and be just as fruitful for the company they worked for.Many offices initiated an RTO (return to office) mandate to boost company morale. I won't act like I know if that truly makes a difference, but it's obvious that remote work is sought after by many folks in the workforce. There are pros and cons to remote work for sure, but the biggest pro is employee safety. When bad weather breaks out and you really don't want to use a PTO day, you can open your laptop and go about your daily tasks without difficulty.The southern US-based user who posted this next story doesn't particularly enjoy working from home, but they were hoping to get the green light from their manager when a freak snowstorm hit the area. Instead of getting the go-ahead, their boss told them if they don't want to come to the office, they are required to take a PTO day and the same goes for the rest of their department.The funny thing, though, is that other departments at the same company are allowed to work from home. Baffled, the user can't believe the company is willing to have their entire department go MIA instead of simply allowing them to work remotely and keep themselves safe off the road. I guess the company would rather sabotage employee output instead…",

    "description": "The new year has settled in, 2025 is already comfortable and cozy, but it means that last month Christmas was over and done. Christmas brings a time of happiness and joy, dotted with gifts, and these gifts sometimes happen to be animals. Now, we're not particularly against gifting a precious little pet to someone on a happy time such as Christmas, but we definitely do not endorse getting rid of such a gift as if it were any other toy or piece of clothing that doesn't fit. That is just plain cruelty, no matter how tough it suddenly became for a person to become a pawrent.Last month a humble hooman witnessed with his own eyes a kindle of kittens being thrown to the side of the road from a passing car. Maybe they were a \"discarded Christmas gift\"? It won't surprise us if this is the case, but our hooman hero of the story didn't have an opportunity to find out, since the car the kittens were thrown out of drove away fast. But this hearty hooman couldn't stay indifferent and took this litter in, found furever homes to all of them but one - who he now shares his home with.When his sassy kitten, Banks, grew up a little, his hooman turned to the online feline family to inquire about his potential breed - but we all know the online feline family, they did not stay indifferent to this touching rescue story. The reactions expressed everything from sadness about the initially intended fate of the cute kittens, through anger about the person who decided to throw them at the side of the road, to the wholesome gratitude for this hearty hooman who saved Banks and his kitten siblings. Oh, and also some funny reactions about the sassy pictures of the kitten… Scroll down to melt your feline-infatuated heart!",

    "description": "Antonio's team hired some very expensive contractors and consultants to help them build a Java based application. These contractors were very demure, very mindful, about how using ORMs could kill performance. So they implemented a tool that would let them know any time the Hibernate query generator attempted to perform a cross join. public class DB2390Dialect extends org.hibernate.dialect.DB2390Dialect { private Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(DB2390Dialect.class); @Override public String getCrossJoinSeparator() { try { Exception e = new Exception(); throw e; } catch (Exception xe) { logger.warn(\"cross join \", xe.getMessage()); } return \", \"; } } I'm going to call this one a near miss. I understand what they were trying to do. Hibernate uses a set of \"dialect\"s to convert logical operations in a query to literal syntax- as you can see here, this function turns a cross join operation into a \", \". What they wanted to do was detect where in the code this happened and log a message. They wanted the message to contain a stack trace, and that's why they threw an exception. Unfortunately, they logged, not the stack trace, but the message- a message which they're not actually setting. Thus, the logger would only ever log \"cross join \", but with no information to track down when or why it happened. That said, the standard way in Java of getting the stack trace skips the exception throwing: StackTraceElement[] st = new Throwable().getStackTrace(). Of course, that would have made them do some actual logging logic, and not just \"I dunno, drop the message in the output?\" The only remaining question is how much did this feature cost? Since these were \"expert consultants\", we can ballpark it as somewhere between \"a few thousand dollars\" to \"many thousands of dollars\"..
