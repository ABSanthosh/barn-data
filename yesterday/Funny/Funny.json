    "description": "Nothing is more cowboy than memes! And that's the yee-hawin' truth. A cowboy life is rough and tough. You ride horses, feed horses, take care of horses, and eat beans. It's not easy! I'm making it sound easy, but there is so much more to it that only a cowboy will understand, so I won't even both mentioning it. It's not because I'm not a cowboy! I'm the most boot clackin', lasso lassoing, cowboy you ever did see! Ain't nobody tougher than a meme slinger this side of the Mississippi. Cowboys need a good laugh too. We're talkin' hootin and hollerin. It's not just about the horses and beans, it's also about the good gang outlaws you make on the way. So, put that ten gallon hat on, say howdy to your pardoner, and giddy on up to these memes below!",

    "description": "You'll find yourself in one of these situations, wondering to yourself whether or not it's worth speaking up. Even if you're on the right side of things, morally, ethically, and according to company policy, doing so could land you in hot water and on the wrong side of a wrongful termination because someone above you in the chain let their ego get in the way.At that point, wrongful or not… you're still fired. Many of us simply cannot afford to up and quit a job in dramatic fashion or take a theatrical last stand at work in order to put our toxic, egotistical boss in their place. Doing so would place us in a compromised position where we're out of a job and scrambling to find another to simply make ends meet. If you have rapport or positioning in the company where you think doing otherwise is possible and even appreciated, then you can do so. But making an effort to stand out in anything but a positive light might see you up on the chopping block. While there is no consensus on the widely reported claim that most Americans live paycheck to paycheck, many households report that they do, with nearly half of Americans reporting that they \"somewhat agree\" with the statement \"I am living paycheck to paycheck.\" Surely, most people at least feel the strain and necessity of not being able to effortlessly handle a period without any income.Because of this, the reality is that the best way to handle any conflict or expectation at work is to do whatever is expected, insulate yourself from and mitigate the effects of that expectation on your personal life, and quietly determine whether or not you want to continue to work there. If you are in a situation where a change is not next to impossible, then it's time to start looking for other employers.",

Always something dramatic, always something that stresses us out that we wish we could simply ignore. And although no, we can't ignore the world forever, we do think that it is healthy to sometimes, for even five minutes, take a break from the madness and simply enjoy some wholesome cat memes. It really is that simple sometimes. Take five minutes, scroll through some heartwarming cat memes, and suddenly, the burning fire will not feel quite so hot, at least for a while. That's all that we ask for. And that is all that we are about to bring you - some pawsitive cat memes.

    "description": "Happy Meownday, feline fam. We're writing about this post below to share some impawtant life lessons with you, but first, let's give you a little summary of what to expect. A feline foster mom decided to look after her friends' cat for an indefinite amount of time. Weeks turned into months, and months turned into a year. She, of course, became purrfectly bonded with the cute kitty. But then, when they came back, they expected her to return the cat to them, even though she already felt like the cat was hers. This is the first life lesson that we hope to impart to you: cat ownership is not based on emeowtions. Just because she cared for the cat, and even paid for expenses, the cat had a microchip with her friends' names on it, and they have documentation of ownership. This is all that matters. If they have a microchip, they legally belong to someone else… even if you rescued them off the street. Scroll down to read how an unfortunate miscommunication forced her to give back the cat she fell in love with below.Fluff. Chaos. Drama! Our weekly cat newsletter has it all -  subscribe here.",

    "description": "James's team has a pretty complicated deployment process implemented as a series of bash scripts. The deployment is complicated, the scripts doing the deployment are complicated, and failures mid-deployment are common. That means they need to gracefully roll back, and they way they do that is by making backup copies of the modified files. This is how they do that. DATE=`date '+%Y%m%d'` BACKUPDIR=`dirname ${DESTINATION}`/backup if [ ! -d $BACKUPDIR ] then echo \"Creating backup directory ...\" mkdir -p $BACKUPDIR fi FILENAME=`basename ${DESTINATION}` BACKUPFILETYPE=${BACKUPDIR}/${FILENAME}.${DATE} BACKUPFILE=${BACKUPFILETYPE}-1 if [ -f ${BACKUPFILE} ] || [ -f ${BACKUPFILE}.gz ] ; then BACKUPFILE=${BACKUPFILETYPE}-2 ; fi if [ -f ${BACKUPFILE} ] || [ -f ${BACKUPFILE}.gz ] ; then BACKUPFILE=${BACKUPFILETYPE}-3 ; fi if [ -f ${BACKUPFILE} ] || [ -f ${BACKUPFILE}.gz ] ; then BACKUPFILE=${BACKUPFILETYPE}-4 ; fi if [ -f ${BACKUPFILE} ] || [ -f ${BACKUPFILE}.gz ] ; then BACKUPFILE=${BACKUPFILETYPE}-5 ; fi if [ -f ${BACKUPFILE} ] || [ -f ${BACKUPFILE}.gz ] ; then BACKUPFILE=${BACKUPFILETYPE}-6 ; fi if [ -f ${BACKUPFILE} ] || [ -f ${BACKUPFILE}.gz ] ; then BACKUPFILE=${BACKUPFILETYPE}-7 ; fi if [ -f ${BACKUPFILE} ] || [ -f ${BACKUPFILE}.gz ] ; then BACKUPFILE=${BACKUPFILETYPE}-8 ; fi if [ -f ${BACKUPFILE} ] || [ -f ${BACKUPFILE}.gz ] ; then BACKUPFILE=${BACKUPFILETYPE}-9 ; fi if [ -f ${BACKUPFILE} ] || [ -f ${BACKUPFILE}.gz ] ; then cat \u003c\u003cEOF You have already had 9 rates releases in one day. ${BACKUPFILE} already exists, do it manually !!! EOF exit 2 fi Look, I know that loops in bash can be annoying, but they're not that annoying. This code creates a backup directory (if it doesn't already exist), and then creates a file name for the file we're about to backup, in the form OriginalName.Ymd-n.gz. It tests to see if this file exists, and if it does, it increments n by one. It does this until either it finds a file name that doesn't exist, or it hits 9, at which point it gives you a delightfully passive aggressive message: You have already had 9 rates releases in one day. ${BACKUPFILE} already exists, do it manually !!! Yeah, do it manually. Now, admittedly, I don't think a lot of folks want to do more than 9 releases in a given day, but there's no reason why they couldn't just keep trying until they find a good filename. Or even better, require each release to have an identifier (like the commit or build number or whatever) and then use that for the filenames. Of course, just fixing this copy doesn't address the real WTF, because we laid out the real WTF in the first paragraph: deployment is a series of complicated bash scripts doing complicated steps that can fail all the time. I've worked in places like that, and it's always a nightmare. There are better tools! Our very own Alex has his product, of course, but there are a million ways to get your builds repeatable and reliable that don't involve BuildMaster but also don't involve fragile scripts. Please, please use one of those.

    "description": "\"Toledo is on Earth, Adrian must be on Venus,\" remarks Russell M. , explaining \"This one's from weather.gov. Note that Adrian is 28 million miles away from Toledo. Being raised in Toledo, Michigan did feel like another world sometimes, but this is something else.\" Even Toledo itself is a good bit distant from Toledo. Definitely a long walk.   \"TDSTF\", reports regular Michael R. from London, well distant from Toledo OH and Toledo ES.   Also on the bus, astounded Ivan muses \"It's been a long while since I've seen a computer embedded in a piece of public infrastructure (here: a bus payment terminal) literally snow crash. They are usually better at listening to Reason...\"   From Warsaw, Jaroslaw time travels twice. First with this entry \"Busses at the bus terminus often display time left till departure, on the front display and on the screens inside. So one day I entered the bus - front display stating \"Departure in 5 minutes\". Inside I saw this (upper image)... After two minutes the numbers changed to the ones on the lower image. I'm pretty sure I was not sitting there for six hours...\"   And again with an entry we dug out of the way back bin while I was looking for more bus-related items. Was it a total concidence this bus bit also came from Jaroslaw? who just wanted to know \"Is bus sharing virtualised that much?\" I won't apologize, any kind of bus will do when we're searching hard to match a theme.   [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds.
