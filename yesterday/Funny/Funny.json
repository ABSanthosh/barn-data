    "description": "It's a tricky thing to make someone feel something that they don't feel. And when you're a teen there's so much changing emotionally that it's sometimes hard to make sense of the things you're actually feeling without trying to force it—or having someone gaslighting you and saying that you said something that you never said. When that person is your parent, it makes things a whole lot more complicated; this is the person who is supposed to be showing you the way, and while they probably think they are, they're actually obfuscating the path forward.You can't force love towards a new family member; sure, one day, you might get there, but it is something that needs to develop naturally, pretty much by definition. This teen made it pretty clear that she wouldn't regard her stepfather as her \"dad,\" but that didn't stop her mom from claiming that she'd said otherwise, forcing her into family therapy sessions to try and change the way she felt about her stepfather.",

    "description": "Some workers just never properly learn Zoom call etiquette. A lot of folks got really proficient at using the video call service when we all had to work at our homes for a while a few years back. But others are still new to the app, and aren't quite sure how to run a meeting. For example, it's common etiquette to mute your microphone if you aren't speaking. It's not enough just to stay quiet, because there's bound to be background noise, like kids running around, dogs barking, or cars revving. If you're muted, no one can hear you take a sip of your drink or tap your feet. Even little noises can be distracting to the current speaker, and unmuting yourself can happen with a single click of a button. This student had a similar experience before ever joining the workforce as they met up with a school club through a video call. But the club already had some \"weird rules,\" as the student explained, leading to the club organizers demanding that everyone turn on their cameras and microphones at all times. That seems like a recipe for disaster! Up next, read about these people who tried to be funny, only to have their jokes backfire in their faces, leaving them completely embarrassed.",

There was \"a media\" and it was rigorously policed. There's simply too much information to be contiguous at this point; it must divide, partition, like a cell. People live in radically different worlds now, and the same information has a different valence in each of them. Engagement, devoid of context or meaning, is the coin of the realm where data has proliferated beyond our ability to meaningfully process it. This is how it came to be that two objectively abhorrent demons and a greasy, grinning mannequin have entered the business of feeding children.",

    "description": "As a general rule, if you're using an RDBMS and can solve your problem using SQL, you should solve your problem using SQL. It's how we avoid doing joins or sorts in our application code, which is always a good thing. But this is a general rule. And Jasmine sends us one where solving the problem as a query was a bad idea. ALTER FUNCTION [dbo].[GetName](@EntityID int) RETURNS varchar(200) AS BEGIN declare @Name varchar(200) select @Name = case E.EntityType when 'Application' then A.ApplicationName when 'Automation' then 'Automated Process' when 'Group' then G.GroupName when 'Organization' then O.OrgName when 'Person' then P.FirstName + ' ' + P.LastName when 'Resource' then R.ResourceName when 'Batch' then B.BatchComment end from Entities E left join AP_Applications A on E.EntityID = A.EntityID left join CN_Groups G on E.EntityID = G.EntityID left join CN_Organizations O on E.EntityID = O.EntityID left join CN_People P on E.EntityID = P.EntityID left join Resources R on E.EntityID = R.EntityID left join AR_PaymentBatches B on E.EntityID = B.EntityID where E.EntityID = @EntityID return @Name END The purpose of this function is to look up the name of an entity. Depending on the kind of entity we're talking about, we have to pull that name from a different table. This is a very common pattern in database normalization- a database equivalent of inheritance. All the common fields to all entities get stored in an Entities table, while specific classes of entity (like \"Applications\") get their own table which joins back to the Entities table. On the surface, this code doesn't even really look like a WTF. By the book, this is really how you'd write this kind of function- if we were going by the book. But the problem was that these tables were frequently very large, and even with indexes on the EntityID fields, it simply performed horribly. And since \"showing the name of the thing you're looking at\" was a common query, that performance hit added up. The fix was easy- write out seven unique functions- one for each entity type- and then re-write this function to use an IF statement to decide which one to execute. The code was simpler to understand and read, and performed much faster. In the end, perhaps not really a WTF, or perhaps the root WTF is some of the architectural decisions which allow this to exist (why a function for getting the name, and the name alone, which means we execute this query independently and not part of a more meaningful join?). But I think it's an interesting example of how \"this is the right way to do it\" can lead to some unusual outcomes.
