You want your kid to go to the best school, have educational toys, and be surrounded by a great community of people. Having children can inspire parents to make the world a better place: the things they tolerated for themselves, like a lazy HOA, become intolerable once their precious children are in the mix. And in this Mom's case, once she learned the local HOA was taking her money without actually delivering results, her path forward was clear: it was time to join the HOA and get it fixed up herself. After that, read about the freshly fired employee who sabotaged a critically important project: \"It needs to be 'basically ready' in 2 weeks.\"",

We're not talking about disliking olives, pepperoni, or other kinds of toppings. We're talking about someone who can't eat tomatoes or cheese. To make matters worse, this entitled customer had the audacity to type up an overly dramatic letter to give to the server and kitchen staff of said pizza establishment detailing everything that might happen if he were given cheese, tomatoes, or other ingredients that he cannot eat. Let's just say that the letter was not sparse in the details of this customer's dietary restrictions and the consequences of not following them. Still, the only way to make this simpler for all involved would be if this person sought out a cuisine or restaurant that had items on the menu that he could actually eat. These were not simple modifications, and if anyone should be making any adjustments here, it should be the customer!",

The cats and their well-being should be everyone's first priority. Maybe we've been hanging out around a weird crowd, because that's how it's always been for us. People have usually been kind, so we couldn't understand it. And we've been looking for a story that would give us hope again. And today, we found it. There was so much potential for drama here, but none of it happened. Two weeks ago, when we came across this story for the first time, when this mailwoman was contemplating if it was ethical to take someone else's cat to the vet, we were worried. But today, when we finally got the update, and things went as beautifully and amazingly as we could have… Yeah, we needed this.",

Some people buy themselves a fancy cup of coffee, others a chocolate bar, but us? We treat ourselves with a pawsitively generous serving of funny feline memes.If we can't snuggle our cute cats at home, we might as well absorb some fluffy feline energy through these hissterical memes that are pawsitively purrfect to take your Tuesday from trash to terrific. They're silly, they're wholesome, and they're purrfectly feline. That means that they love you one second, and the next, you're getting bitten for one pet too many. Right now, they love you, so get to scrolling before they change their minds. Have a great week!",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/what-the-ffffffff",
    "description": "Combining Java with lower-level bit manipulations is asking for trouble- not because the language is inadequate to the task, but because so many of the developers who work in Java are so used to working at a high level they might not quite \"get\" what they need to do. Victor inherited one such project, which used bitmasks and bitwise operations a great deal, based on the network protocol it implemented. Here's how the developers responsible created their bitmasks: private static long FFFFFFFF = Long.parseLong(\"FFFFFFFF\", 16); So, the first thing that's important to note, is that Java does support hex literals, so 0xFFFFFFFF is a perfectly valid literal. So we don't need to create a string and parse it. But we also don't need to make a constant simply named FFFFFFFF, which is just the old twenty = 20 constant pattern: technically you've made a constant but you haven't actually made the magic number go away. Of course, this also isn't actually a constant, so it's entirely possible that FFFFFFFF could hold a value which isn't 0xFFFFFFFF. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.

    "description": "Kate inherited a system where Java code generates JavaScript (by good old fashioned string concatenation) and embeds it into an output template. The Java code was written by someone who didn't fully understand Java, but JavaScript was also a language they didn't understand, and the resulting unholy mess was buggy and difficult to maintain. Why trying to debug the JavaScript, Kate had to dig through the generated code, which led to this little representative line: dojo.byId('html;------sites------fileadmin------en------fileadmin------index.html;;12').setAttribute('isLocked','true'); The byId function is an alias to the browser's document.getElementById function. The ID on display here is clearly generated by the Java code, resulting in an absolutely cursed ID for an element in the page. The semicolons are field separators, which means you can parse the ID to get other information about it. I have no idea what the 12 means, but it clearly means something. Then there's that long kebab-looking string. It seems like maybe some sort of hierarchy information? But maybe not, because fileadmin appears twice? Why are there so many dashes? If I got an answer to that question, would I survive it? Would I be able to navigate the world if I understood the dark secret of those dashes? Or would I have to give myself over to our Dark Lords and dedicate my life to bringing about the end of all things? Like all good representative lines, this one hints at darker, deeper evils in the codebase- the code that generates (or parses) this ID must be especially cursed. The only element which needs to have its isLocked attribute set to true is the developer responsible for this: they must be locked away before they harm the rest of us.
