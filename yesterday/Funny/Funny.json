    "description": "Heya, gamers and cat pawrents who are one and the same! We're here to give you a small break, you can actually camp here for a while and no one will get mad at you. It's a spot so purrfect for any cat pawrent who likes to game, it's a spot for you to kek and for some cat shenanigans in meme form. Get out of your high DPS mindset and unwind with us here, in the home-base of online cat comedy. We gathered a very special collection of cat memes - it is tailored for all you late-night gamers, who game when your cat is sprawled on your lap.This isn't a DLC, you can incorporate this cat-gaming hybrid meme break, just like any game genre hybridization. Your cat-gaming meme break can be a little puzzle-adventure, but it can also be casual-RPG. Sometimes, with cats being cats, it can be a little action-FPS - but that's okay, because cats will be cats, and this is exactly why we love them.",

    "description": "What goes around comes around. Sibling rivalries can be difficult for families to navigate. When siblings are children and they're facing off with one another, their parents can intervene and try to mediate things between the kiddos before feelings get too hurt. But when those kids grow up, it's a whole different story. And especially when the parents have a favorite child, it can make a rivalry even more tricky to work out a peaceful compromise. This person, writing in under the name u/No_Kiwi_2, opens their story with a startling line: \"My brother said he was going to propose at my wedding.\" Yes, you read that right: their brother told this person that he was going to propose on his sibling's special day!",

Back in the 90s, Beanie Babies were all the rage and rubes everywhere lined up to buy these collectible children's toys under the guise that they'd one day be valuable enough to pay for their kid's college education. Welp, I'm a millennial and grew up with a box full of Beanies and while I played with a select few toys, my parents kept the 'valuable' ones up in a plastic box on the highest shelf in my room. As the Princess Diana bear looked down at me from the highest throne in my bedroom, I imagined the glorious things I'd do with my paid-for college education–because one day, this Beanie would be sold to pay for it all!Here we are, two decades later, and that purple bear is nearly worthless, I'm up to my ears in student loans, and I'm starting to wonder what sort of Ty-brand hypnosis fooled an entire generation of boomers… It must be the same Kool-aid all of the crypto bros are drinking.",

    "description": "Happy 2025 to all our readers. I can already tell this year's columns are going to be filled with my (least) favorite form of WTF, the impossible endless gauntlet of flaming password hurdles to jump over or crawl under. Please comment if you know why this week's column has this title and why it doesn't have the title Swordfish. Peter G. starts off our new year of password maladies with a complaint that is almost poetic. \"Between desire and reality. Between fact and breakfast. Between 8 and -6:00. Madness lies, lies, lies...\"   Rick P. keeps it going. \"Must begin with a capital letter!!!\" he exclaims with three (3!) exclamation points. I think it deserved four.   Mark Whybird justifiably grumbled \"If I knew what the policy was, maybe then I could come up with a password to satisfy it!\"   R3D3-1 who swears he is NOT a bot, found a kind of interestingly complicated error challenge, opining \"Password requirements can be annoying. Especially when they don't tell you what the requirements are, only that you failed. But here they send me a confirmation Email, and only when clicking the confirmation Email did they even tell me! That's kind of a new low there... \"   And finally ending this beginning, faithful Pascal remarks only: \"WTF\". Well said.   [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.

We're in the world of InternalFrameInternalFrameTitlePaneInternalFrameTitlePaneMaximizeButtonWindowNotFocusedState in terms of names, but this one has the added bonus of being misleading. This type represents a key/value pair. They're both integers. That's it. It's a pair of ints.
