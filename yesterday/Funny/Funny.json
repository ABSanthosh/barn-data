    "description": "Being young and joining the workforce is an eye-opening experience. It's not long before the idealism and optimism you might have had about the meaningful career you were going to have quickly evaporate, both because of the people you're in close proximity with, along with the frustrating hierarchies, unwritten political rules, and power dynamics.You'll find that you encounter quite a lot of people, both managers and coworkers, who are quite happy to take advantage of their newfound feeling of superiority they have over you, not because of any real aptitude or authority either, simply because of your age.Of course, there are things you have to learn as you cut your teeth on the ins and outs of working life and the industry in general. But it's surprising the number of barriers you'll face simply because of your fresh-faced appearance.This 18-year-old working in a café encountered a new shift lead who was clearly eager to exert her dominance over the young woman. While chatting with her coworkers while also handling tasks during downtime, the shift lead suddenly took offense, telling her, \"You're not paid to socialize. You're paid to work. Less talking, more doing.\" This led to her malicious compliance with the order, which ultimately caused her boss to back down from the ultimatum.",

    "description": "Some people say home is where the heart is, but for one group of renters, home was wherever their entitled landlady could invade their privacy and ration out basic freedoms like they were living in a benevolent dictatorship. Imagine seven adults paying real money to share bathrooms, having zero kitchen rights, and watching their own food get stolen and served at someone else's table. The landlady in this saga treated \"my house, my rules\" less like a phrase and more like a constitutional amendment. Bringing your own appliances was banned, the fridge was her private domain, and anyone with a food allergy might as well call urgent care on move-in day. Boundaries were a suggestion at best. Locked doors or personal belongings were fair game for spontaneous \"cleaning sessions,\" and tenants learned the hard way that mentioning privacy was an invitation for gossip storms and passive-aggressive lectures. If someone tried to set up a logical laundry schedule, it became her cue to run the washing machine around the clock and then blame every repair bill on the roommates.  Long-term tenants were treated like squatters compared to the royal welcome extended to nightly Airbnb guests, who always got first dibs on the \"good bathroom.\"",

A major company you have definitely heard of and depending upon the size of the area you live in, they may even have a bank branch near you. I've reloaded the page and clicked the sort button multiple times to order the rows by date in both ascending and descending order. It always ends up the same. May 17th and 18th happened twice, but not in the expected order.\" I must say that it is more fun when we know who they are.   A job hunter with the unlikely appelation full_name suggested titling this \"[submission_title]\" which seems appropriate.   \"The browser wars continue to fall out in HTML email,\" reports Ben S. \"Looking at the source code of this email, it was evidently written by \u0026 for Microsoft products (including tags!), and the author likely never saw the non-Microsoft version I'm seeing where only a haphazard assortment of the links are styled. But that doesn't explain why it's AN ELEVEN POINT SCALE arranged in a GRID.\"   \"The owl knows who you are,\" sagely stated Jan. \"This happens when you follow someone back. I love how I didn't have to anonymize anything in the screenshot.\"   \"Location, location, location!\" crows Tim K. who is definitely not a Time Lord. \"Snarky snippet: Found while cleaning up miscellaneous accounts held by a former employee. By now we all know to expect how these lists are sorted, but what kind of sadist *created* it? Longer explanation: I wasn't sure what screenshot to send with this one, it just makes less and less sense the more I look at it, and no single segment of the list contains all of the treasures it hides. \"America\" seems to refer to the entire western hemisphere, but from there we either drill down directly to a city, or sometimes to a US state, then a city, or sometimes just to a country. The only context that indicates we're talking about Jamaica the island rather than Jamaica, NY is the timezone listed, assuming we can even trust those. Also, that differentiator only works during DST. There are eight entries for Indiana. There are TEN entries for the Antarctic.\" Well. In this case, there is a perfectly good explanation. TRWTF is time zones, that's all there is to it. These are the official IANA names as recorded in the public TZDB. In other words, this list wasn't concocted by a mere sadist, oh no. This list was cooked up by an entire committee!

    "description": "Dan's co-workers like passing around TDWTF stories, mostly because seeing code worse than what they're writing makes them feel less bad about how often they end up hacking things together. One day, a co-worker told Dan: \"Hey, I think I found something for that website with the bad code stories!\" Dan's heart sank. He didn't really want to shame any of his co-workers. Fortunately, the source-control history put the blame squarely on someone who didn't work there any more, so he felt better about submitting it. This is another ASP .Net page, and this one made heavy use of GridView elements. GridView controls applied the logic of UI controls to generating a table. They had a page which contained six of these controls, defined like this: \u003casp:GridView ID=\"gvTaskMonth1\" runat=\"server\" CssClass=\"leadsGridView\" AutoGenerateColumns=\"False\" OnRowDataBound=\"gvTaskMonth1_RowDataBound\"\u003e ... asp:GridView\u003e \u003casp:GridView ID=\"gvTaskMonth2\" runat=\"server\" CssClass=\"leadsGridView\" AutoGenerateColumns=\"False\" OnRowDataBound=\"gvTaskMonth1_RowDataBound\"\u003e ... asp:GridView\u003e \u003casp:GridView ID=\"gvTaskMonth3\" runat=\"server\" CssClass=\"leadsGridView\" AutoGenerateColumns=\"False\" OnRowDataBound=\"gvTaskMonth1_RowDataBound\"\u003e ... asp:GridView\u003e The purpose of this screen was to display a roadmap of coming tasks, broken up by how many months in the future they were. The first thing that leaps out to me is that they all use the same event handler for binding data to the table, which isn't in-and-of-itself a problem, but the naming of it is certainly a recipe for confusion. Now, to bind these controls to the data, there needed to be some code in the code-behind of this view which handled that. That's where the WTF lurks: /// /// Create a roadmap for the selected client /// private void CreateRoadmap() { for (int i = 1; i \u003c 7; i++) { switch (i) { case 1: if (gvTaskMonth1.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth1, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod1.Text), \"1\"); } break; case 2: if (gvTaskMonth2.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth2, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod2.Text), \"2\"); } break; case 3: if (gvTaskMonth3.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth3, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod3.Text), \"3\"); } break; case 4: if (gvTaskMonth4.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth4, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod4.Text), \"4\"); } break; case 5: if (gvTaskMonth5.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth5, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod5.Text), \"5\"); } break; case 6: if (gvTaskMonth6.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth6, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod6.Text), \"6\"); } break; } } } Ah, the good old fashioned loop-switch sequence anti-pattern. I understand the motivation: \"I want to do the same thing for six different controls, so I should use a loop to not repeat myself,\" but then couldn't quite figure out how to do that, so they just repeated themselves, but inside of a loop. The \"fix\" was to replace all of this with something more compact: private void CreateRoadmap() { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth1, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod1.Text), \"1\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth2, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod2.Text), \"2\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth3, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod3.Text), \"3\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth4, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod4.Text), \"4\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth5, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod5.Text), \"5\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth6, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod6.Text), \"6\"); } That said, I'd recommend not trying to parse date times inside of a text box inside of this method, but that's just me. Bubbling up the inevitable FormatException that this will generate is going to be a giant nuisance. It's likely that they've got a validator somewhere, so it's probably fine- I just don't like it. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod.
