    "description": "If you've ever owned a cat, read at least one article on our page, or have ever spent more than 5 minutes with a cat, you know one thing: cats are love. We love them, you love them, people love them, even other animals love cats. Our cats make us better versions of ourselves, so why not spread all those purrfectly wholesome feelings around? Everyone deserves love and the opportunity to be a better person, so one correctional facility in Indiana took a chance, and it pawsitively paid off!They implemented a feline foster program that allowed inmates with good behavior to foster homeless shelter cats. Not only did the cats get a hooman to love them, but it actually increased behavior in the prison and reduced the amount of fights! Of course, we could have told you this would happen, but it's nice to see it happen in real life. Be the hooman your floofy, fabulous feline thinks you are. See more pictures below, and we hope your day is filled with lots of kitty love!",

    "description": "CATS ARE THE SILLIEST CREATURES. They blep and mlem constantly, while their face is stuck in a silly expression, staring out to the vastness of space and time. Cats get scared of thin air, jumping in a panic from seemingly nothing. And finally, cats get the zoomies, which is arguably the silliest instinct a domesticated princess can have.CATS ARE THE SMARTEST CREATURES. They always know what time it is right now, and their strict schedule actually helps us, humble hoomans, to keep track of our lives. Cats are fiercely independent and can take care of themselves. It's not that they don't love us, but they are definitely sharp and capable. And finally, they know their family - other hoomans and animals of the house - and they're very smart to know that they are part of something.CAT MEMES ARE THE SILLIEST SMARTEST MEMES. And this is why we love to celebrate cats' silliness and smartness with a big bunch of silly and smart cat memes. We love cats. We love how silly they are. We love how smart they are. We love cat memes.",

    "description": "Let's face it: Some of us are blessed with really sweet, endearing in-laws, and the rest are faced with parents-in-law who seem to possess a likeness of an underworld ruler. There is simply no in-between. Whether you said something they disagreed with and have written you off as a lost cause or they are simply entitled individuals who care more about their happiness rather than their child's, in-law qualms are more common than not.To ring in the holiday season, we thought what better way to get festive than to prepare folks for the hectic and chaotic scenes they enter every year during November and December. Though you can't change who your in-laws are, there's no shame in poking fun at your sticky situation. You can love your partner to the ends of the earth and it still wouldn't be enough to combat some families. Know that you've done your best, and your best bet is to take a sip of a yummy drink and watch the fire from the couch this Thanksgiving. Sit this one out, folks! Scroll below.",

    "description": "This person is lending out way too much money to their friends! There's only so much you can do for your friends before you're officially the one being taken advantage of. After all, friendship is supposed to be a give-and-take. You laugh together and cry together. You listen to their troubles and they listen to yours. If it's not reciprocal, it can leave one or both of you with conflicting feelings. You might start to wonder why you're always the one who has to pay the bill at the end of a meal because your friend keeps insisting they've fallen on hard times. Or in this person's case, you might accidentally loan your friends thousands of dollars over time, leaving you with an entire friend group who owes you big.This person, u/mastagoose, has learned the hard way that they need to be cautious when mixing money with friendship. There's that common rule that states that if you're going to loan someone money, just give it as a gift, and don't expect to get it back. That way, there won't be any hard feelings when you notice your friend wearing a new outfit or buying an expensive meal, knowing that they haven't paid you back. This guy not only hasn't forgotten about their numerous loans to friends, but they made a list about it, and the people of the internet were not exactly kind to them. Instead, they were repeatedly told that they should stop lending people money ASAP. Maybe they'll take the internet's advice! Up next, read about one 22-year-old employee who \"decided to start including the Chairman/CEO…on all emails\" in order to get their coworkers to reply to their emails.",

Like Jerry said in his post it would be hard to explain what these books are about if you are not already neck deep in 40K lore. Just know that Magnus was a good boy who was just trying to warn his Dad about something very bad that was going to happen but instead he ended up making his Dad super mad. Like…SUPER mad. There is a saying in the community that “Magnus did nothing wrong” and while I am not sure that’s entirely true (he did after all destroy the magical wards that protected holy Terra from the Warp), I do think he had good intentions.",

You're catching air on your jetbike in view of a passel of weird-ass moons, and even though you are an immortal space warrior you have a machine gun and a bunch of feathers poking out. In 40k, people fly around in huge churches that are so big there are people in the belly of them that think the outside world is a myth. They have Space Vikings and Space Vampires. Acquisitions Incorporated can hit some real drama precisely because it's incredbly goof troop for the majority of the runtime. Somehow, being silly in some ways - unabashed - allows Games Workshop's cadre of writers to pull out some gruesome gut punches. Magnus the Red falls in that category.",

    "description": "Amateur physicist B.J. is going on vacation, but he likes to plan things right down to the zeptosecond. \"Assume the flight accelerates at a constant speed for the first half of the flight, and decelerates at the same rate for the second half. 1) What speed does the plane need to reach to have that level of time dilation? 2) What is the distance between the airports?\"   Contrarily, Eddie R. was tired of vacation so got a new job, but right away he's having second thoughts. \"Doing my onboarding, but they seem to have trouble with the idea of optional.\"   \"Forget UTF-8! Have you heard about the new, hot encoding standard for 2024?!\" exclaimed Daniel , kvetching \"Well, if you haven't then Gravity Forms co. is going to change your mind: URLEncode everything now! Specially if you need to display some diacritics on your website. Throw away the old, forgotten UTF-8. Be a cool guy, just use that urlencode!\"   Immediately afterward, Daniel also sent us another good example, this time from Hetzner. He complains \"Hetzner says the value is invalid.

    "description": "Matt needed to add a new field to a form. This simple task was made complicated by the method used to save changes back to the database. Let's see if you can spot what the challenge was: public int saveQualif(String docClass, String transcomId, String cptyCod, String tradeId, String originalDealId, String codeEvent, String multiDeal, String foNumber, String codeInstrfamily, String terminationDate, String premiumAmount, String premiumCurrency, String notionalAmount, String codeCurrency, String notionalAmount2, String codeCurrency2, String fixedRate, String payout, String maType, String maDate, String isdaZoneCode, String tradeDate, String externalReference, String entityCode, String investigationFileReference, String investigationFileStartDate, String productType, String effectiveDate, String expiryDate, String paymentDate, String settInstrucTyp, String opDirection, String pdfPassword, String extlSysCod, String extlDeaId, String agrDt) throws TechnicalException, DfException That's 36 parameters right there. This function, internally, creates a data access object which takes just as many parameters in its constructor, and then does a check: if a field is non-null, it updates that field in the database, otherwise it doesn't. Of course, every single one of those parameters is stringly typed, which makes it super fun. Tracking premiumAmount and terminationDate as strings is certainly never going to lead to problems. I especially like the pdfPassword being stored, which is clearly just the low-security password meant to be used for encrypting a transaction statement or similar: \"the last 4 digits of your SSN\" or whatever. So I guess it's okay that it's being stored in the clear in the database, but also I still hate it. Do better! In any case, this function was called twice. Once from the form that Matt was editing, where every parameter was filled in. The second time, it was called like this: int nbUpdates = incoming.saveQualif(docClass, null, null, null, null, null, multiDeal, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null); As tempted as Matt was to fix this method and break it up into multiple calls or change the parameters to a set of classes or anything better, he was too concerned about breaking something and spending a lot of time on something which was meant to be a small, fast task. So like everyone who'd come before him, he just slapped in another parameter, tested it, and called it a day. Refactoring is a problem for tomorrow's developer.
