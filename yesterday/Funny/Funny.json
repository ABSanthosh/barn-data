    "description": "You can only push an employee so far before they just completely break down. Some workplaces know this, and handle their employee's emotions gently. Others are less gentle, but they still defend their employees from their worst clients or customers. And then there are workplaces who are simply do not care about how their workers feel. And if that worker crashes out and storms out of the building, well, that's totally fine, because there's another worker who can take their place in a minute. At retail stores and restaurants, an employee meltdown is just par for the course. Customers can be so impolite, and they do not care about making that staffer feel bad. If a diner's meal came out cold, they'll have no trouble berating the waitstaff until they're brought to tears! At least some of the workers who told their stories below quit their jobs on the spot, which is a feel-good moment for us all. Next, read the polarizing story of the dude who bought a $50k guitar for $4k, but the circumstances led to everyone in his social circle getting mad at him: \"[I'm] refusing to sell it back.\"",

Here's the deal: the movie is not exactly being embraced by critics or audiences, but some folks are at least enjoying the film as an unintentional piece of camp. This lady, however, did not exactly have a humorous bone in her body and was therefore unable to crack a smile, especially because she had been forced to go to the movie theater by her own kids.This is what happens when your unkind behavior is projected onto others because, believe it or not, the reason this woman found herself stuck in a movie theater watching a highly miscast Gal Gadot belt her heart out was due to an act of petty revenge.",

There are lots of Pupils, and none of them agree on what the lesson they're supposed to learn even is, but that's the least of their problems. This is what she looks like!  Eyrewood energy. Chaotic Great, the team behind the game, has been incredibly fun to work with and speak to which happens sometimes on projects but rarely to this extent. I should have known they would be cool as soon as I figured out the game's logo was an Ambigram. The Kickstarter is kicking ass and they keep adding cool shit to it, including early access to a dangerous digital version of the game at a certain threshold. I hope we get to play around in this world again at some point. (CW)TB",

They would. You just know that they would. They support taking revenge in every way. Cats may look innocent, but they are not. Seriously, no matter how small the offense, cats will do something about it. We have seen cats take revenge on vacuums that give them the jeebie jeebies. Heck, we have even seen cats yell at water with all of their might because it accidentally touched them. So, although these cats probably would not have preferred one of their humans to go… \"number 2\" in one of their litterboxes, based on their reactions afterward, we can only conclude that they respect her even more for doing it. They must have known that her boyfriend was toxic and that he deserved it. If they could talk, we are sure that they would have told this woman that they really respect her game.",

    "description": "Today's anonymous submitter has managed to find a way to do date formatting wrong that I don't think I've seen yet. That's always remarkable. Like most such bad code, it checks string lengths and then adds a leading zero, if needed. It's not surprising, but again, it's all in the details: // convert date string to yyyy/MM/DD return dtmValue.Year + \"-\" + ((dtmValue.Month.ToString().Length == 1)? (\"0\" + dtmValue.Month.ToString()): dtmValue.Month.ToString()) + \"-\" + ((dtmValue.Day.ToString().Length == 1)? (\"0\" + dtmValue.Day.ToString()): dtmValue.Day.ToString()); This is only one line, but it has it all, doesn't it. First, we've got good ol' Hungarian notation, which conveys no useful information here. We've got a comment which tells us the code outputs /es, but the code actually outputs -. We've got ternaries that are definitely not helping readability here, plus repeated calls to ToString() instead of maybe just storing the result in a variable. And, for the record, dtmValue.ToString(\"yyyy-MM-dd\") would have done the correct thing. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.
