There are the eager workers, the ones whose productivity is as loud and overbearing as their motivational mug collection. And, of course, you can't forget (you probably can actually) the office ghost, the one no one has actually seen working, but everyone hopes will haunt someone else's shift soon.But then, towering above all workplace stereotypes like a monument sculpted entirely from apathy, is a legendary specimen who manages to exist at the intersection of invisibility and visible dust. This is the coworker who specializes in underachieving with such consistency, it's almost an achievement. Some coworkers quietly do something, this one does nothing loudly.",

Of course, some folks have no problem letting that number increase exponentially.

For the anxious managers out there, watch out because your employees may already know that the secret to making your stress levels skyrocket is via email sabotage.

    "description": "One of the things that we love most about cats, feline fam, is that they can really bring people together. We all live so much in our own worlds nowadays that it can be difficult to connect with others. However, cats are the great barrier-breakers - and this video proves it. One unsuspecting guest at a hotel was shocked to find an unaccompanied cat carrier just sitting in their hotel lobby. No pawrents around or anyone to claim the poor cat, so they started asking around. Unfortunately, they didn't have much luck and found out that the cat was abandoned there.Other guests helped them in their search, and one even offered to let it stay with them for the night while its future was being decided. Long story short, the kitty is now off to its furrever home, thanks to these wholesome hotel guests who rallied together to save this poor, scared cat.

When we think about this we get anxious, so we simply prefer to not think about this possibility ever and go to cuddle our cute cat immediately. Because how's that even possible to comprehend a life without a cat in it? We want to always have cats in our lives, in every moment. We're sure that every cat pawrent feels the same way about their fluffy feline friends.We don't want you either to think of this depressing state of not having cats in your life. On the contrary - we want you to have as many cats as you want in your life! Now, we cannot, unfortunately, bring you a cat right to your doorstep - but we can definitely increase the amount of wholesome cat memes you look at.

My wife Kara likes these sim style games but until now I have managed to avoid the genre. Now I’m spending all day operating my own collectible toy car store though. That by itself would probably be enough to get me but not only does your store stock blind boxes of various levels full of random toy cars (along with track and other accessories), but these cars all have stats and can be raced against customers on slot car style tracks! Here's the kicker, you can open these boxes yourself and collect the cars! After a day of playing I now have two employees who manage the cash registers all day while I sit in the corner and open blind boxes to fill out my supercar collection.  -Gabe Out",

    "description": "Today's Anonymous submitter was reviewing some C++ code, and saw this perfectly reasonable looking pattern. class SomeClass { public: void setField(int val); int getField(); } Now, we can talk about how overuse of getters and setters is itself an antipattern (especially if they're trivial- you've just made a public variable with extra steps), but it's not wrong and there are certainly good reasons to be cautious with encapsulation. That said, because this is C++, that getField should really be declared int getField() const- appropriate for any method which doesn't cause a mutation to a class instance. Or should it? Let's look at the implementation. void SomeClass::setField(int val) { setGetField(true, val); } void SomeClass::getField() { return setGetField(false); } Wait, what? Why are we passing a boolean to a method called setGet. Why is there a method called setGet? They didn't go and make a method that both sets and gets, and decide which they're doing based on a boolean flag, did they? int SomeClass::setGetField(bool set, int val) { static int s_val = 0; if (set) { s_val = val; } return s_val; } Oh, good, they didn't just make a function that maybe sets or gets based on a boolean flag. They also made the state within that function a static field. And yes, function level statics are not scoped to an instance, so this is shared across all instances of the class. So it's not encapsulated at all, and we've blundered back into Singletons again, somehow. Our anonymous submitter had two reactions. Upon seeing this the first time, they wondered: \"WTF? This must be some kind of joke. I'm being pranked.\" But then they saw the pattern again. And again. After seeing it fifty times, they wondered: \"WTF? Who hired these developers? And can that hiring manager be fired? Out of a cannon? Into the sun?\" [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time.

    "description": "Now, I would argue that the event-driven lifecycle of ASP .Net WebForms is a bad way to design web applications. And it's telling that the model is basically dead; it seems my take is at best lukewarm, if not downright cold. Pete inherited code from Bob, and Bob wrote an ASP .Net WebForm many many ages ago, and it's still the company's main application. Bob may not be with the company, but his presence lingers, both in the code he wrote and the fact that he commented frequently with // bob was here Bob liked to reinvent wheels. Maybe that's why most methods he wrote were at least 500 lines long. He wrote his own localization engine, which doesn't work terribly well. What code he did write, he copy/pasted multiple times. He was fond of this pattern: if (SomeMethodReturningBoolean()) { return true; } else { return false; } Now, in a Web Form, you usually attach your events to parts of the page lifecycle by convention. Name a method Page_Load? It gets called when the load event fires. Page_PreRender? Yep- when the pre-render event fires. SomeField_MouseClick? You get it. Bob didn't, or Bob didn't like coding by naming convention. Which, I'll be frank, I also don't like coding by naming convention, but it was the paradigm Web Forms favored, it's what the documentation assumed, it's what every other developer was going to expect to see. Still, Bob had his own Bob way of doing it. In every page he'd write code like this: this.PreRender += this.RequestPagePreRender That line manually registers an event handler, which invokes the method RequestPagePreRender. And while I might object to wiring up events by convention- this is still just a convention. It's not done with any thought at all- every page has this line, even if the RequestPagePreRender method is empty. [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod.
