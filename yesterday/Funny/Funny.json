    "description": "In this job market, or any job market, really, optimistic job-seekers choose to believe the gig they landed will work out. This willful ignorance allows us to get by and curb our warranted suspicions about the job role. Is it a good idea to curb our judgment? Probably not. Do we do it anyway and wait until the first day to make a judgment call? Yep. Sometimes, employees don't need to wait out the entire eight-hour shift to realize they should throw on their walking boots and hit the road, and fast. Entitled supervisors and cardboard box desks will do that to anyone.This r/AskReddit thread is riddled with stories from employees sharing their reasons for hitting the road during their first day on the job. You know it's a pretty bad gig when folks can't even stick out a whole day, and they shouldn't have to. If you're quitting, you're quitting. Save yourself and the company some precious time and be blunt. However, the reasons these employees decided to leave their jobs, well… are astounding.",

However, some people try to hide stains or rips to make the clothing look nicer. I mean sure, it does look a little nicer in the promotional photos, but the buyer is going to be very upset when they get that shirt and realize it has a big oil spot on it.These people shared their experiences trying to buy clothes online, and it's way harder than it should be! You can check it all out below, from sellers who can't seem to get to the post office, to people who are trying to sell utter garbage. Next, read about the person who kicked out their pregnant 19-year-old step-daughter because she banished their elderly cat to the outdoors: \"Step-daughter... got what she deserved.\"",

Don't get us wrong, having nineteen cats sounds like a dream - a giant, fluffy dream filled with cuddle puddles and cat hair. Unfortunately, we don't have room in our house for nineteen cats, but if we had a farm, well, that's a whole other story. Luckily, we don't have nineteen cats to adopt, but the guy in this post does!While working on his farm, this man found not one, not two, but nineteen cute kitties in his barn after discovering that it is a popular place for people to dump their unwanted pets (don't even get us started on these people). Well, there's always plenty of work to do around a farm, so at the very least, mice and gophers won't be a problem anymore. Scroll down to see all of these kitties snuggled into one giant feline family photo and read more of the story below!",

Kiko has never played one, but he's got a storehouse of skill he developed playing Bloodborne and a lot of that is gonna map. I'm comfortable saying that Monster Hunter is, itself, a genre.",

Mostly this is a \"black box\" situation, where Markus doesn't look at the code, and instead goes by the interface and the requirements. Sometimes, though, he does look at the code, and wishes he hadn't. Today's snippet comes from a program which is meant to generate PDF files and then, optionally, email them. There are a few methods we're going to look at, because they invested a surprising amount of code into doing this the wrong way. protected override void Execute() { int sendMail = this.VerifyParameterValue(ParamSendMail); if (sendMail == -1) return; if (sendMail == 1) mail = true; this.TraceOutput(Properties.Resources.textGetCustomerForAccountStatement); IList customers = AccountStatement.GetCustomersForAccountStatement(); if (customers.Count == 0) return; StreamWriter streamWriter = null; if (mail) streamWriter = AccountStatement.CreateAccountStatementLogFile(); CreateAccountStatementDocumentEngine engine = new CreateAccountStatementDocumentEngine(); foreach (CustomerModel customer in customers) { this.TraceOutput(Properties.Resources.textCustomerAccountStatementBegin + customer.DisplayName.ToString()); // Generate the PDF, optionally send an email with the document attached engine.Execute(customer, mail); if (mail) { AccountStatement.WriteToLogFile(customer, streamWriter); this.TraceOutput(Properties.Resources.textLogWriting); } } engine.Dispose(); if (streamWriter != null) streamWriter.Close(); } Now, this might sound unfair, but right off the bat I'm going to complain about separation of concerns. This function both generates output and emails it (optionally), while handling all of the stream management. Honestly, I think if the developer were simply forced to go back and make this a set of small, cohesive methods, most of the WTFs would vanish. But there's more to say here. Specifically, let's look at the first few lines, where we VerifyParameterValue. Note that this function clearly returns -1 when it fails, which is a very C-programmer-forced-to-do-OO idiom. But let's look at that method. private int VerifyParameterValue(string name) { string stringValue = this.GetParam(name, string.Empty); bool isValid = this.VerifyByParameterFormat(name, stringValue); if (!isValid) return -1; int value = -1; try { value = Convert.ToInt32(stringValue); } catch (Exception e) { this.TraceOutput(string.Concat(\"\\n\\n\\n\", e.Message, \"\\n\\n\\n\")); return -1; } return value; } We'll come back to the VerifyByParameterFormat but otherwise, this is basically a wrapper around Convert.ToInt32, and could easily be replaced with Int32.TryParse. Bonus points for spamming the log output with loads of newlines. Okay, but what is the VerifyByParameterFormat doing? private bool VerifyByParameterFormat(string name, string value) { string parameter = string.Empty; string message = string.Empty; if (value.Length != 1) { parameter = Properties.Resources.textSendMail; message = string.Format(Properties.Resources.textSendMailNotValid, value); this.TraceOutput(string.Concat(\"\\n\\n\\n\", message, \"\\n\\n\\n\")); return false; } string numbers = \"0123456789\"; char[] characters = value.ToCharArray(); for (byte i = 0; i \u003c characters.Length; i++) { if (numbers.IndexOf(characters[i]) \u003c 0) { parameter = Properties.Resources.textSendMail; message = Properties.Resources.textSendMailNotValid; this.TraceOutput(string.Concat(\"\\n\\n\\n\", message, \"\\n\\n\\n\")); return false; } } return true; } Oh, it just goes character by character to verify whether or not this is made up of only digits. Which, by the way, means the CLI argument needs to be an integer, and only when that integer is 1 do we send emails. It's a boolean, but worse. Let's assume, however, that passing numbers is required by the specification. Still, Markus has thoughts: Handling this command line argument might seem obvious enough. I'd probably do something along the lines of \"if (arg == \"1\") { sendMail = true } else if (arg != \"0\") { tell the user they're an idiot }. Of course, I'm not a professional programmer, so my solution is way too simple as the attached piece of code will show you. There are better ways to do it, Markus, but as you've shown us, there are definitely worse ways. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.

    "description": "Today, we look at a simple bit of bad code. The badness is not that they're using Oracle, though that's always bad. But it's how they're writing this PL/SQL stored function: FUNCTION CONVERT_STRING_TO_DATE --Public (p_date_string IN Varchar2, p_date_format IN Varchar2 DEFAULT c_date_format) Return Date AS BEGIN If p_date_string Is Null Then Return Null; Else Return To_Date(p_date_string, p_date_format); End If; END; -- FUNCTION CONVERT_STRING_DATE This code is a wrapper around the to_date function. The to_date function takes a string and a format and returns that format as a date. This wrapper adds two things, and the first is a null check. If the input string is null, just return null. Except that's exactly how to_date behaves anyway. The second is that it sets the default format to c_date_format. This, actually, isn't a terrible thing. If you check the docs on the function, you'll see that if you don't supply a format, it defaults to whatever is set in your internationalization settings, and Oracle recommends that you don't rely on that. On the flip side, this code is used as part of queries, not on processing input, which means that they're storing dates as strings, and relying on the application layer to send them properly formatted strings. So while their to_date wrapper isn't a terrible thing, storing dates as strings definitely is a terrible thing.
