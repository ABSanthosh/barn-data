    "description": "When invited to a wedding, you usually have at least an idea of what to expect, and the things you are unsure about are usually stated on the invite or simple questions for the bride or groom. Now, imagine you have a rich uncle who has spared no expense for all of his sons weddings. He has three kids, and the first two weddings were extravagant ceremonies with lots of food, fun, and memories to be made. And now the third son is getting married! You must be excited for the wedding—since the last two were so exciting.  And yet… You walk into a sterile-looking office building with unclothed tables, no decorations, and no meals. Just a cookie or ice cream. Like, wait, what? What happened?! You'd think if the kid was trying to make a point, it would be more clear. Right now it just appears like the uncle hates his youngest, even though nobody would ever think that of the kind man. So what's happening?  Well, ask this guy, because that's exactly what went down in their family.",

    "description": "You know that feeling when you do your boss a solid, even though you don't have to, and then you're somehow the one who is in the wrong? If you're familiar with this, that's because you broke the number one rule in the workplace: Never do more than what you're told to do. Others might disagree, but you're getting paid to do concrete tasks. You are replaceable to every company, no matter how much you believe you're an asset, so act your wage!Yes, that includes coming into the office on days you have remote privileges. Some employees think going above and beyond will land them a ticket straight to six-figure territory, but that's only the case sometimes, and even that word is pushing it.In this next story, an employee switches up their remote work days because of construction that's being done on their residence. Their boss has an issue with this, but fails to remember all of the times this same employee went out of their way to be in the office when it was not necessary. So, as payback, the employee vows to never work from home on non-designated days ever again—but forget about coming in on remote days. Scroll to read.",

More than money, more than a raise, more than winning the lottery, we want a cat to literally need to be next to us at all times. Because right now, we're going and stealing our cats while they're sleeping and forcing them to cuddle with us until they get up and walk away. So we can't imagine ever returning a cat for being \"too needy\", we're ready to return our cats for not being needy enough! We're joking, of course, we would never give up one of our cats… but they could show us a little more love from time to time.Meet Toblerone (formerly named Joel), who was adopted with a sibling kitten from a shelter, and then returned to said shelter for being too affectionate. All seemed lost for Joel, until one family saw his heart and accepted his love. Now he's Toblerone, and he's purrfectly purring with his new hoomans.

    "description": "Raising a cat? Oh, you mean signing up for the daily chaos of a four-legged toddler who naps 16 hours a day and still has the audacity to act like they run the place? Yeah, that sounds about right.Being a cat pawrent means accepting that your fancy shelf decor is now a series of launching pads. Your bed? Shared. Your food? Stared at (at the very least). Your privacy? Nonexistent. Especially when you're in the bathroom. And if you've ever been personally victimized by a 3 AM zoomie attack or found a mysterious hairball in your shoe, congratulations! You're truly living that cat child experience.But despite the drama, the sass, the random bouts of destruction, we wouldn't trade it for anything. Because when that little damage goblin curls up in your lap like you were the one who knocked over the water glass and bit the laptop charger, it's all worth it. So here's to the wild ride of feline parenthood!

The players did not even need to bring their character sheets to the session.

A major company you have definitely heard of and depending upon the size of the area you live in, they may even have a bank branch near you. I've reloaded the page and clicked the sort button multiple times to order the rows by date in both ascending and descending order. It always ends up the same. May 17th and 18th happened twice, but not in the expected order.\" I must say that it is more fun when we know who they are.   A job hunter with the unlikely appelation full_name suggested titling this \"[submission_title]\" which seems appropriate.   \"The browser wars continue to fall out in HTML email,\" reports Ben S. \"Looking at the source code of this email, it was evidently written by \u0026 for Microsoft products (including tags!), and the author likely never saw the non-Microsoft version I'm seeing where only a haphazard assortment of the links are styled. But that doesn't explain why it's AN ELEVEN POINT SCALE arranged in a GRID.\"   \"The owl knows who you are,\" sagely stated Jan. \"This happens when you follow someone back. I love how I didn't have to anonymize anything in the screenshot.\"   \"Location, location, location!\" crows Tim K. who is definitely not a Time Lord. \"Snarky snippet: Found while cleaning up miscellaneous accounts held by a former employee. By now we all know to expect how these lists are sorted, but what kind of sadist *created* it? Longer explanation: I wasn't sure what screenshot to send with this one, it just makes less and less sense the more I look at it, and no single segment of the list contains all of the treasures it hides. \"America\" seems to refer to the entire western hemisphere, but from there we either drill down directly to a city, or sometimes to a US state, then a city, or sometimes just to a country. The only context that indicates we're talking about Jamaica the island rather than Jamaica, NY is the timezone listed, assuming we can even trust those. Also, that differentiator only works during DST. There are eight entries for Indiana. There are TEN entries for the Antarctic.\" Well. In this case, there is a perfectly good explanation. TRWTF is time zones, that's all there is to it. These are the official IANA names as recorded in the public TZDB. In other words, this list wasn't concocted by a mere sadist, oh no. This list was cooked up by an entire committee! If you have the courage, you can learn more than you ever wanted to know about time at the IANA time zones website   [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod.

    "description": "Dan's co-workers like passing around TDWTF stories, mostly because seeing code worse than what they're writing makes them feel less bad about how often they end up hacking things together. One day, a co-worker told Dan: \"Hey, I think I found something for that website with the bad code stories!\" Dan's heart sank. He didn't really want to shame any of his co-workers. Fortunately, the source-control history put the blame squarely on someone who didn't work there any more, so he felt better about submitting it. This is another ASP .Net page, and this one made heavy use of GridView elements. GridView controls applied the logic of UI controls to generating a table. They had a page which contained six of these controls, defined like this: \u003casp:GridView ID=\"gvTaskMonth1\" runat=\"server\" CssClass=\"leadsGridView\" AutoGenerateColumns=\"False\" OnRowDataBound=\"gvTaskMonth1_RowDataBound\"\u003e ... asp:GridView\u003e \u003casp:GridView ID=\"gvTaskMonth2\" runat=\"server\" CssClass=\"leadsGridView\" AutoGenerateColumns=\"False\" OnRowDataBound=\"gvTaskMonth1_RowDataBound\"\u003e ... asp:GridView\u003e \u003casp:GridView ID=\"gvTaskMonth3\" runat=\"server\" CssClass=\"leadsGridView\" AutoGenerateColumns=\"False\" OnRowDataBound=\"gvTaskMonth1_RowDataBound\"\u003e ... asp:GridView\u003e The purpose of this screen was to display a roadmap of coming tasks, broken up by how many months in the future they were. The first thing that leaps out to me is that they all use the same event handler for binding data to the table, which isn't in-and-of-itself a problem, but the naming of it is certainly a recipe for confusion. Now, to bind these controls to the data, there needed to be some code in the code-behind of this view which handled that. That's where the WTF lurks: /// /// Create a roadmap for the selected client /// private void CreateRoadmap() { for (int i = 1; i \u003c 7; i++) { switch (i) { case 1: if (gvTaskMonth1.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth1, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod1.Text), \"1\"); } break; case 2: if (gvTaskMonth2.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth2, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod2.Text), \"2\"); } break; case 3: if (gvTaskMonth3.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth3, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod3.Text), \"3\"); } break; case 4: if (gvTaskMonth4.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth4, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod4.Text), \"4\"); } break; case 5: if (gvTaskMonth5.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth5, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod5.Text), \"5\"); } break; case 6: if (gvTaskMonth6.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth6, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod6.Text), \"6\"); } break; } } } Ah, the good old fashioned loop-switch sequence anti-pattern. I understand the motivation: \"I want to do the same thing for six different controls, so I should use a loop to not repeat myself,\" but then couldn't quite figure out how to do that, so they just repeated themselves, but inside of a loop. The \"fix\" was to replace all of this with something more compact: private void CreateRoadmap() { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth1, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod1.Text), \"1\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth2, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod2.Text), \"2\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth3, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod3.Text), \"3\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth4, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod4.Text), \"4\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth5, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod5.Text), \"5\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth6, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod6.Text), \"6\"); } That said, I'd recommend not trying to parse date times inside of a text box inside of this method, but that's just me. Bubbling up the inevitable FormatException that this will generate is going to be a giant nuisance. It's likely that they've got a validator somewhere, so it's probably fine- I just don't like it. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod.
