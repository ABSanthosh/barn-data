    "description": "The famous opening line of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina is, \"All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" You see a lot of different kinds of family stories if you're scouring the internet like we are here. Parents who stepped up, parents who stepped out. Children with allegiances to parents other people wouldn't understand. There's only so much you can say in a Reddit post to create a full image of your family situation. And yet, people do it every day, trying to glean any understanding of their predicament from the anonymous advice of fellow Redditors. A shout to the void, a call to the abyss. \"Can anyone hear me?\" \"Does anyone relate?\" More often than not, people do, and they have a lot to say about it.Take this story, for example, where OP's uniquely strained family situation comes to a head when his half-siblings try to connect with him after their mother's passing. Estranged from his half-siblings at a young age, OP spent his upbringing with his father. When his half-siblings reach out to him with the intent of pulling him away from his father, he has to grapple with their life story as well as his own. Do you agree with his decision?",

    "description": "As a recent adult, going home for the holidays is always a special treat. You never have to worry about where you'll find your next meal, you can sleep in until noon snuggled up in your childhood bed, and maybe even the family dog will nestle in with you to keep you warm. Sure, some annoying family dynamics are bound to arise, but it's all worth it for some much-needed rest and relaxation. Going away from home makes these luxuries even more delicious. You don't realize how much you miss your family until you are living on your own, experiencing the freedom of adulthood you've always longed for.It's easy to feel afraid of leaving home. The world outside is big and scary, and learning how to take care of yourself is one of the hardest things a person can achieve. However, if you never leave home, you run the risk of never reaching your full personhood. In this story, a father is facing that moment with his son, who is refusing to grow up. Will OP's firm hand drive his son away, or will it be a much-needed wake-up call for a person in need of a kick in the pants?",

We normally like to keep things light and fluffy over here at I Can Has Cheezburger, but sometimes, we have to get real. Bad things happen in the world sometimes, especially to good people. All we can do is try to pick up the pieces afterward.Our cats have helped us get through more trying times than we can count. Technically we saved them from life in a shelter, but they saved us many more times over. They are there for us in our most trying times, and for that, we are purrfectly grateful. When this feline-loving girlfriend falls ill, her boyfriend makes the bittersweet promise to cherish, love, and protect her cats after she passes. She left, and now he has them to remember her by. Scroll down to read the whole story below, and we're serious - get some tissues.",

It's a sassy Sunday, and who better to lead the charge against the Monday mellows than our furbulous feline overlords? Cats are the undisputed champions of side-eye, masters of judgmental looks, and pawfessional throwers of shade. Honestly, their sass levels are off the charts, and we're just lucky they let us witness their meowgnificence.As Monday lurks around the corner, our cats are already rolling their eyes at the audacity of Monday to even exist. We gathered these sassy cat memes here to remind you to embrace your inner cattitude. Strut into the week as if you own it (just like a cat entering any room), toss a little sass over your shoulder, and let the world know you're not here to be messed with. With just half the amount of sass a cat possesses - Meownday doesn't stand a chance. Look at your sassy cat, look at these sassy cat memes, and you might learn a thing or two.",

    "description": "Antonio's team hired some very expensive contractors and consultants to help them build a Java based application. These contractors were very demure, very mindful, about how using ORMs could kill performance. So they implemented a tool that would let them know any time the Hibernate query generator attempted to perform a cross join. public class DB2390Dialect extends org.hibernate.dialect.DB2390Dialect { private Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(DB2390Dialect.class); @Override public String getCrossJoinSeparator() { try { Exception e = new Exception(); throw e; } catch (Exception xe) { logger.warn(\"cross join \", xe.getMessage()); } return \", \"; } } I'm going to call this one a near miss. I understand what they were trying to do. Hibernate uses a set of \"dialect\"s to convert logical operations in a query to literal syntax- as you can see here, this function turns a cross join operation into a \", \". What they wanted to do was detect where in the code this happened and log a message. They wanted the message to contain a stack trace, and that's why they threw an exception. Unfortunately, they logged, not the stack trace, but the message- a message which they're not actually setting. Thus, the logger would only ever log \"cross join \", but with no information to track down when or why it happened. That said, the standard way in Java of getting the stack trace skips the exception throwing: StackTraceElement[] st = new Throwable().getStackTrace(). Of course, that would have made them do some actual logging logic, and not just \"I dunno, drop the message in the output?\" The only remaining question is how much did this feature cost? Since these were \"expert consultants\", we can ballpark it as somewhere between \"a few thousand dollars\" to \"many thousands of dollars\"..
