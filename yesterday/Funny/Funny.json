    "description": "These days, it feels like there are more red flags than green ones when you're on a first date. Perhaps you have a mental checklist in your mind. Are they human? Are they single? Do they have a 401k? Each singleton has their own personalized criteria. However, one thing that feels pretty universally unacceptable in this day and age is a non-stop texter. After all, you have both presumably gone through the trouble of incessant swiping on dating apps, putting up with surface-level initial messages, and clearing both of your schedules to set up a time to actually meet face-to-face. The last thing anyone should want in this situation is to have a one-sided conversation with someone who won't listen or take notice of you.That's what happened to this Redditor, who tried numerous times to suggest to his date across the table that she was behaving poorly, to no avail. Eventually, he decided to go to the bathroom and he told himself that if he saw that she was still texting when he got out, he would walk out of the side door of the restaurant and leave her to pay the bill. Not exactly the most chivalrous move, but we're inclined to believe that this was earned.For more stories like this, take a look at this post about embarrassing moments people had in public.",

    "description": "Living in a co-op certainly has its advantages, but it also means that you may or may not be at the mercy of a building Karen.Here, we have a new tenant who just moved into her co-op in noisy midtown Manhattan two weeks prior. She threw a small housewarming get-together with ten people on a Friday night. These are all folks in their late twenties or early thirties who knew that this was a quiet, low-key event rather than some kind of rager. Unfortunately for the Redditor who hosted the event, she would have to deal with the building Karen who insisted that they were being too loud despite no complaints from other residents and repeated attempts to maintain a respectful level of noise. Plus, as we mentioned, they live in a noisy part of the city that is naturally way busier and louder, so you would think the Karen would be accustomed to a little activity.Keep scrolling below for the full saga and to see what happened the following morning when the resident caught the building Karen loitering outside her apartment.

    "link": "https://cheezburger.com/110465793/nobody-wanted-this-cat-woman-adopts-the-aggressive-kitty-that-has-been-stuck-in-the-shelter-and",
    "description": "So many time throughout our years of writing for ICHC, we have come across stories similar to this one. And while it is true that cats are truly aggressive and really do not want to hang with us humans, it seems that most aggressive cats just need some love. Some love and time and respect of their boundaries. Even the most aloof cat will show affection eventually. Even the most aggressive cat will make a turnaround if only given the chance. Oftentimes, the aggression is just a defense mechanism. It's a reaction based in fear. Cats need to feel comfortable with their people and in their environments, and for cats like the one in this video, who has been possibly abandoned and stuck in a shelter for so long, aggression is not something unexpected. But just like that - with a little bit of genuine love and care from the right people, this cat showed her true, sweet purrsonality.",

We're an indoor cat born in a hooman body, and alas, we must venture into the great outdoors (AKA, outside our houses) in order to survive. There are lots of awful things that happen outdoors, like people yelling at us to get off the counter, hoomans not sharing their food with us, and not having your own litter box when you really need to go….but there are also some good things in the world - like cat memes!Whenever we're feeling down, we just have a nice, pleasant scroll through some silly kitties in the form of digital delights, and we're smiling in no time. You know what we're talking about, right? Who has time to be sad when there are so many funny cats all over the internet? We spend hours every day searching for the funniest memes of fluffy felines for you and we still never get tired of them. Don't be sad, just scroll through some feline funnies! They're the cure for every ailment. What are you waiting for? A smile is just one scroll away!",

    "description": "When SC got hired, the manager said \"unit testing is very important to us, and we have 100% test coverage.\" Well, that didn't sound terrible, and SC was excited to see what kind of practices they used to keep them at that high coverage. [Test] public void a_definition() { Assert.True(new TypeExpectations() .DerivesFrom\u003cobject\u003e() .IsConcreteClass() .IsSealed() .HasDefaultConstructor() .IsNotDecorated() .Implements() .Result); } This is an example of what all of their tests look like. There are almost no tests of functionality, and instead just long piles of these kinds of type assertions. Which, having type assertions isn't a bad idea, most of these would be caught by the compiler: DerviesFrom is a tautology (perhaps this test framework is ensuring it doesn't derive from other classes? but object is the parent of all classes) IsConcreteClass would be caught at compile time anywhere someone created an instance HasDefaultConstructor would again, be caught if it were used Implement would also be caught anywhere you actually tried to use polymorphism. IsSealed and IsNotDecorated will actually do something, I suppose, though I wonder how much I actually care about that something. It's not wrong to check, but in the absence of actual real unit tests, why do I care? Because every class had a test like this, and because of the way the test framework worked, when they ran code coverage metrics, they got a 100% score. It wasn't testing any of the code, mind you, but hey, the tests touched all of it. [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.

    "description": "The most common type of submission Error'd receives are simple, stupid, data problems on Amazon. The text doesn't match the image, the pricing is goofy, or some other mixup that are just bound to happen with a database of zillions of products uploaded by a plethora of barely-literate mountain village drop-shippers. So I don't usually feature them, preferring to find something with at least a chance of being a creative new bug. But I uncovered a story by Mark Johansen about his favorite author, and decided that since so many of you obviously DO think online retail flubs are noteworthy, what the heck. Here is Mark's plain-text story, and a handful of bungled products. They're not exactly bugs, but at least some of them are about bugs. \"I guess I missed your item about failings of AI, but here's one of my favorites: Amazon regularly sends me emails of books that their AI thinks I might want to read, presumably based on books that I've bought from them in the past. So recently I got an email saying, \"The newest book by an author you've read before!\" And this new book was by ... Ernest Hemingway. Considering that he died almost 60 years ago, it seemed unlikely that he was still writing. Or where he was sending manuscripts from. Lest you wonder, it turned out it was a collection of letters he wrote when he was, like, actually alive. The book was listed as authored by Ernest Hemingway rather than under the name of whomever compiled the letters.\" What do we all think? Truly an Error'd, or just some publisher taking marketing advice from real estate agents? Let me know. A while back, Christian E. \"Wanted to order some groceries from nemlig.com. So I saw the free (labelled GRATIS) product and pressed the info button and this popped up. Says that I can get the product delivered from the 1st of January (today is the 2nd of march). Have to wait for a while then...\" Not too much longer, Christian.   Reliable Michael R. muttered \"msofas either have their special math where 5% always is GBP10 or they know already what I want to buy.\"   \"Do not feed to vegetarians.\" warns Jeffrey B.   \"Not sure how this blue liquid works for others, but there has been no sucking here yet,\" reports Matthias.   \"Nice feature but I am not sure if it can fit in my notebook,\" writes Tiger Fok.   Lady-killer Bart-Jan is preparing for Friday night on the town, apparently. Knock 'em dead, Bart! \"It says 'Fragrance for Men'. Which is fine, as long as it also does a good job deterring the female mosquitoes.\"   [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.
