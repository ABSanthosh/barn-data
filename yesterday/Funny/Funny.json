    "description": "We want to make one thing clear before we start here. We love all cats. All of them - big and small, wild and domesticated. We love fluffy lynxes and their huge mitten paws. We love the perpetually annoyed and confused jaguarundis. And we love - goodness - do we love housecats. For our little fluffy children, we would do anything. With all that said… we do have a special spot in our hearts, just an itty bitty corner, for a particular kind of cat who simply steals our hearts all over again every time we see it. Pallas' cats. We don't know what it is about them. Maybe it's how fluffy they are, maybe it's how large they are, maybe it's the fact that Pallas' cats place their paws on their tails when they're cold, or maybe the fact that they are literally always grumpy. Whatever it is, we love them a whole lot. And this Pallas' cat momma just had six of them - six smol kittens who are even clumsier, grumpier and derpier than her, and we're beyond in love. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.

    "description": "The struggle of living in an HOA neighborhood only reveals itself once you are there and cannot leave. It's like a Twilight Zone where your driveway cannot have a single spot on it, and having trash feels like a dirty little secret. Someone is always watching you, and every little mistake might get you written up, or worse, fined.Those who never had to deal with the HOA might not realize how much of a burden it might be, but believe us, and thousands of frustrated residents, when we say–if you can avoid it, don't do it to yourselves. It just is not worth it.If you need further proof, all you need is to scroll down and read the story below. It is the tale of a homeowner who got fined for putting their trash can out at the end of their driveway the night before trash pickup. They didn't think it was a big deal, but the HOA eyes were watching, and they did not like what they saw.Keep scrolling to read the full story.

Before you fire someone, make sure they're not the only person who knows how to complete a certain project. Otherwise, things may very well fall apart, as they did when this hot-headed boss gave his only capable worker an ultimatum he would come to regret.After an on-site trip that was far more work than this author was promised, he put his foot down and told his boss that he would not be traveling for similar-sized projects again and would be handling future jobs remotely. He also had his pre-scheduled two-week vacation coming up when his boss put him on a project that looked like an absolute mess. Not only was the author's request regarding on-site projects completely ignored, but he was also pressured to get an obscene job completed right as he was starting his vacation. The employee stood his ground, which caused his ill-tempered boss to request that he resign. Since the worker was already seeing this coming, he was happy to oblige…",

I think it's okay to be a weird little freak and fuck your aging necromancers or your sex vampires or even, in rare and select cases for the real sickos, human beings. People get super mad when you talk shit about their porn, and that's sorta how you know it's porn. I wish there were a way to, in a robust and ongoing way, simply admit that people have kinks without making them into purity spirals and empowering endless grifts.",

    "title": "Classic WTF: Take the Bus",
    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/classic-wtf-take-the-bus",
    "description": "It's summer break time, here at TDWTF, and based on this classic, we shouldn't be traveling by bus. Original --Remy Rachel started working as a web developer for the local bus company. The job made her feel young, since the buses, the IT infrastructure, and most of their back-office code was older than she was. The bus fare-boxes were cash only, and while you could buy a monthly pass, it was just a little cardboard slip that you showed the driver. Their accounting system ran on a mainframe, their garage management software was a 16-bit DOS application. Email ran on an Exchange 5.5 server. In charge of all of the computing systems, from the web to DOS, was Virgil, the IT director. Virgil had been hired back when the accounting mainframe was installed, and had nestled into his IT director position like a tick. The bus company, like many such companies in the US, was ostensibly a private company, but chartered and subsidized by the city. This created a system which had all the worst parts of private-sector and public-sector employment merged together, and Virgil was the master of that system. Rachel getting hired on was one of his rare “losses”, and he wasn’t shy about telling her so. “I’ve been doing the web page for years,” Virgil said. “It has a hit counter, so you can see how many hits it actually gets- maybe 1 or 2 a week. But management says we need to have someone dedicated to the website.” He grumbled. “Your salary is coming out of my budget, you know.” That website was a FrontPage 2000 site, and the hit-counter was broken in any browser that didn’t have ActiveX enabled. Rachel easily proved that there was far more traffic than claimed, not that there was a lot. And why should there be? You couldn’t buy a monthly pass online, so the only feature was the ability to download PDFs of the hand-schedules. With no support, Rachel did her best to push things forward. She redesigned the site to be responsive. She convinced the guy who maintained their bus routes (in a pile of Excel spreadsheets) to give her regular exports of the data, so she could put the schedules online in a usable fashion. Virgil constantly grumbled about wasting money on a website nobody used, but as she made improvements, more people started using it. Then it was election season. The incumbent mayor had been complaining about the poor service the bus company was offering, the lack of routes, the costs, the schedules. His answer was, “cut their funding”. Management started talking about belt-tightening, Virgil started dropping hints that Rachel was on the chopping block, and she took the hint and started getting resumes out. A miracle occurred. The incumbent mayor’s campaign went off the rails. He got caught siphoning money from the city to pay for private trips. A few local cops mentioned that they’d been called in to cover-up the mayor’s frequent DUIs. His re-election campaign’s finances show strange discrepancies, and money had come in that couldn’t be tied back to a legitimate contribution. He tried to get a newly built stadium named after himself, which wasn’t illegal, but was in poor taste and was the final straw. He dropped out of the election, paving the way for “Mayor Fred” to take over. Mayor Fred was a cool Mayor. He wanted to put in bike lanes. He wanted to be called “Mayor Fred”. He wanted to make it easier for food trucks to operate in the city. And while he shared his predecessor’s complaints about the poor service from the bus company, he had a different solution, which he revealed while taking a tour of the bus company’s offices. “I’m working right now to secure federal grants, private sector funding, to fund a modernization project,” Mayor Fred said, grinning from behind a lectern. “Did you know we’re paying more to keep our old buses on the road for five years than it would cost to buy new buses?” And thus, Mayor Fred made promises. Promises about new buses, promises about top-flight consultants helping them plan better routes, promises about online functionality. Promises that made Virgil grumble and whine. Promises that the mayor… actually kept. New buses started to hit the streets. They had GPS and a radio communication system that gave them up-to-the-second location reporting. Rachel got put in charge of putting that data on the web, with a public API, and tying it to their schedules. A group of consultants swung through to help, and when the dust settled, Rachel’s title was suddenly “senior web developer” and she was in charge of a team of 6 people, integrating new functionality to the website. Virgil made his opinion on this subject clear to her: “You are eating into my budget!” “Isn’t your budget way larger?” Rachel asked. “Yes, but there’s so much more to spend it on! We’re a bus company, we should be focused on getting people moving, not giving them pretty websites with maps that tell them where the buses are! And now there’s that new FlashCard project!” FlashCard was a big project that didn’t involve Rachel very much. Instead of cash fares and cardboard passes, they were going to get an RFID system. You could fill your card at one of the many kiosks around the city, or even online. “Online” of course, put it in Rachel’s domain, but it was mostly a packaged product. Virgil, of all people, had taken over the install and configuration, Rachel just customized the stylesheet so that it looked vaguely like their main site. Rachel wasn’t only an employee of the bus company, she was also a customer. She was one of the first in line to get a FlashCard. For a few weeks, it was the height of convenience. The stop she usually needed had a kiosk, she just waved her card at the farebox and paid. And then, one day, when her card was mostly empty and she wasn’t anywhere near a kiosk, she decided to try filling her card online. Thank you for your purchase. Your transaction will be processed within 72 hours. That was a puzzle. The kiosks completed the transaction instantly. Why on Earth would a website take 3 days to do the same thing? Rachel became more annoyed when she realized she didn’t have enough on her card to catch the bus, and she needed to trudge a few blocks out of her way to refill the card. That’s when it started raining. And then she missed her bus, and had to wait 30 minutes for the next one. Which is when the rain escalated to a downpour. Which made the next bus 20 minutes late. Wet, cold, and angry, Rachel resolved to figure out what the heck was going on. When she confronted Virgil about it, he said, “That’s just how it works. I’ve got somebody working full time on keeping that system running, and that’s the best they can do.” Somebody working full time? “Who? What? Do you need help? I’ve done ecommerce before, I can-” “Oh no, you’ve already got your little website thing,” Virgil said. “I’m not going to let you try and stage a coup over this.” With an invitation like that, Rachel decided to figure out what was going on. It wasn’t hard to get into the administration features of the FlashCard website. From there, it was easy to see the status of the ecommerce plugin for processing transactions: “Not installed”. In fact, there was no sign at all that the system could even process transactions at all. The only hint that Rachel caught was the configuration of the log files. They were getting dumped to /dev/lp1. A printer. Next came a game of hide-and-seek- the server running the FlashCard software wasn’t in their tiny data-center, which meant she had to infer its location based on which routers were between her and it. It took a few days of poking around their offices, but she eventually found it in the basement, in an office. In that office was one man with coke-bottle glasses, an antique continuous feed printer, a red document shredder, and a FlashCard kiosk running in diagnostic mode. “Um… can I help you?” the man asked. “Maybe? I’m trying to track down how we’re processing credit card transactions for the FlashCard system?” The printer coughed to life, spilling out a new line. “Well, you’re just in time then. Here’s the process.” He adjusted his glasses and peered at the output from the printer: TRANSACTION CONFIRMED: f6ba779d22d5;4012888888881881;$25.00 The man then kicked his rolly-chair over to the kiosk. The first number was the FlashCard the transaction was for, the second was the credit card number, and the third was the amount. He punched those into the kiosk’s keypad, and then hit enter. “When it gets busy, I get real backed up,” he confessed. “But it’s quiet right now.” Rachel tracked down Virgil, and demanded to know what he thought he was doing. “What? It’s not like anybody wants to use a website to buy things,” Virgil said. “And if we bought the ecommerce module, the vendor would have charged us $2,000/mo, on top of an additional transaction fee. This is cheaper, and I barely have enough room in my budget as it is!” [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.
