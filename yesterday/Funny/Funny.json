Ever since, we have vowed to never ignore her when she demands our attention so badly, even if it is for something as mundane as filling up her food bowl.The hooman in this Reddit story also learned this lesson, and they learned it the hard way. Early in the morning, they were woken up by their cats screaming at them but assumed that the feisty feline just wanted food. Two hours later, the meowing continued, so the hooman decided to follow their cat and see why she demanded so much attention. That is when they discovered that there was gas leaking in the apartment, and their cat was actually saving their life…Keep scrolling to read the full inspiring story.

    "description": "Cats are weird little creatures, goblins even. They goblin around with their strange behavior and we seem to accept it fully, embracing it like it's the best thing that could have happened to humanity. Because it is the best thing that happened to humanity. Cats are the goblinoids that humans didn't necessarily want, but definitely those we needed. We needed a fluffy floof friend with a weird but wholesome aura to hang out with us, so we could truly understand that weird and adorable are not contradicting concepts. Cats are both goofy goblins and cuddly babies, and it doesn't contradict - it's just a fact of life.Some wonderfully weird cat memes embody this sassy and strange cat aura, so it's no wonder we all love them so much. We gathered some of them right here, for all the cat pawrents who know what wonderfully weird cat behaviors we talk about, so we can all enjoy them.",

Once you're out of the office in a casual setting, having some laid-back drinks—even if it's with other members of the office—are you obligated to go out of your way for that coworker that you just don't get along with?That was the issue at hand in this thread, where this woman was upset that her coworker had \"excluded\" by refusing to drive her to their workgroups after dinner drinks. Her coworker turned to this online community to see whether or not he was wrong for his refusal. See the original thread and some key responses, below.",

Without warning, she expected him to pay for everybody just because he made a lot more money than they did. Sounds pretty presumptuous, doesn't it?Every friendly gathering at a restaurant starts off with the best intentions before falling into disrepair. Nobody can agree on a time to meet, someone's going to be 30 minutes late, and by the time the meal is over and the bill comes, each friend is far too stressed out about the proper check etiquette to think straight. Why can't old friends meet up without the drama of a restaurant?Well, the dinner in this next story turned out to be a major disaster after a man took his girlfriend out for her birthday dinner. Since the birthday girl wanted some friends to come along, he obliged. They all had fun until the check came and everyone packed up their things without a word and made a mad dash for the door, leaving the guy strapped with a $550 bill for the whole table. Keep scrolling to read all of the details of this frustratingly presumptuous dinner situation that'll make you cringe with disbelief at the audacity of some people.",

    "description": "This is just a quick post to mention that the Darksiders II Deathinitive edition just dropped yesterday and so far I’m really impressed.  I love all the games in the Darksiders series but I think the second one is probably my favorite. It’s always been a beautiful game with excellent combat, fun traversal and awesome Zelda style puzzles. This new Deathinitive edition makes the game run in 4k at 60FPS, adds Raytracing, DuelSense controller integration and quicker load times. I’ve spent a few hours with the game so far and the upgrades are great! If you never played it I highly recommend grabbing this new version if you’re looking for a slick hack and slash action RPG. If you already played it like me these upgrades make going back totally worth it. These days it feels like a lot of games are trying to be an HBO series instead of a game and Darksiders II is simply a kick ass fucking videogame.   -Gabe Out",

    "description": "Damiano's company had more work than staff, and opted to hire a subcontractor. When hiring on a subcontractor, you could look for all sorts of things. Does their portfolio contain work similar to what you're asking them to do? What's the average experience of their team? What are the agreed upon code quality standards for the contract? You could do that, or you could hire the cheapest company. Guess which one Damiano's company did? If you're not sure, look at this code: if(jQuery('table').hasClass('views-view-grid')){ var EPid= \".views-view-grid\"; jQuery(EPid +' td').each(function(){ if(!jQuery(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().hasClass('view-article-in-right-sidebar') \u0026\u0026 !jQuery(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().hasClass('view-offers-in-right-sidebar')){ var title = jQuery(this).find(\"h2 a\").html(); var body = jQuery(this).find(\".field-name-body\").html(); var datetime = jQuery(this).find(\".field-name-field-event-date-time\").html(); var flyer = jQuery(this).find(\".field-name-field-flyer a\").attr(\"href\"); var imageThumb = jQuery(this).find(\".field-name-field-image-thumb\").html(); var readMore = 'jQuery(this).find(\"h2 a\").attr(\"href\")+'\" class=\"read-more\"\u003eREAD MORE'; var str = ''; if(title != null \u0026\u0026 title != \"\"){ if(imageThumb \u0026\u0026 imageThumb != \"\" \u0026\u0026 imageThumb != null) str = str + imageThumb; if(datetime \u0026\u0026 datetime != \"\" \u0026\u0026 datetime != null) str = str + ''+datetime+''; str = str + ''+title+''; str = str + body + ''; str = str + readMore; } if(flyer) str = str + ''\"\u003etype == \"events\"){ echo 'download the flyer'; }else {echo 'download the article';} ?\u003e'; str = str + ''; jQuery(this).children('.node').remove(); jQuery(this).append(str); } }); This was in a Drupal project. The developer appointed by the contractor didn't know Drupal at all, and opted to build all the new functionality by dropping big blobs of JavaScript code on top of it. There's so much to hate about this. We can start with the parent().parent() chains. Who doesn't love to make sure that your JavaScript code is extremely fragile against changes in the DOM, while at the same time making it hard to read or understand. I like that we create the EPid variable to avoid having a magic string inside our DOM query, only to still need to append a magic string to it. It hints at some programming by copy/paste. Then there's the pile of HTML-by-string-concatenation, which is always fun. But this couldn't be complete without this moment: type == \"events\"){ echo 'download the flyer'; }else {echo 'download the article';} ?\u003e Oh yeah, buried in this unreadable blob of JavaScript there's a little bonus PHP, just to make it a little spicier. The entire project came back from the contractor in an unusable state. The amount of re-work just to get it vaguely functional quickly outweighed any potential cost savings. And even after that work went it, it remained a buggy, unmaintainable mess. Did management learn their lesson? Absolutely not- they bragged about how cheaply they got the work done at every opportunity, and entered into a partnership agreement with the subcontractor. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.

Notably, PHP pins the Unix timestamp to UTC+00:00, aka GMT. So this function takes a time, formats it, parses the format to get what should be the same time back.
