    "description": "Pawrenting is not easy, feline fam. You know this as well as we do. Some days, your cute cat children are purrfect little angels, and others, well, it seems like they have been sent from the very depths of your nightmares to wreak havoc and chaos on your daily routine. We love our furry kids more than life itself, but that doesn't mean that we can't joke about the ups and downs of being a multi-cat pawrent - and there is no better way to giggle through our sorrows than by enjoying some silly cat memes for cat owners. One second, your cat is running around with the zoomies, meowing at you incessantly for a second breakfast, and the next, they're fast asleep in the weirdest pawsition. You have to be ready for anything as a pawrent (especially if your fur baby is a kitten), so these hissterical feline funnies should help you wind down from playtime into a calm, giggly vibe. Enjoy your peace and quiet while your cat child is napping because when they're up, you're back on duty again!",

    "description": "We know that a lot of people don't understand just how attached to our cats we are. They think that our cats only like us because we bring them food and water, not that our cats love us with their whole entire beings, and we love them the same way. They laugh when we say that our cats are our babies, but it's kind of true in some ways. When our cats are sick, or when our cats are sad, we feel it deeply, and when something happens to our cats that we think is… irreversible, it's gut-wrenching. And so we can totally understand the joy, the elation, that this person felt when they were told that their cat has beat cancer. Getting the news of the disease at first must have broken their hearts. It would have broken ours for sure. And we definitely would have been prepared for the worst. But no, the best has happened, and we could not be happier.",

    "description": "Not everyone is great at public speaking. Most people have messed up at least once during a speech, presentation, or interview. Common mistakes include getting facts wrong, mispronouncing someone's name, or losing one's train of thought. However, you do not necessarily see a college student accidentally referring to their much older professor as \"daddy\" as a common mistake.This college student was mortified when she realized that she had just addressed her professor as her father when she was answering a question from him during an important project presentation. Let's just say that this is not something that her classmates let slide. Group chats exploded, one student renamed his profile \"Daddy\" in the class, and even the professor couldn't hold it together. The whole thing is about as cringeworthy as it sounds, but as many people in the comments section suggested, the only way to get through is to own one's mistake. Keep scrolling below for the Redditor's full account of the classroom debacle.

Scammers, landlords, real estate agents, salesmen—even your employer—being some of the few who are more than willing to engage in such behavior…And you know you're in trouble when your landlord is a real estate agency… When the real estate company that owned and managed the apartment that this tenant and their roommates lived in tried to strong-arm the renters into a new contract with higher rents, they were not prepared for the detailed orientation of the people they were dealing with. A year into their time in the tenancy agreement, the landlord-ing company sent a notice ordering the tenants to either \"sign a new contract (with higher rent) or move out within 30 days.\"Worried about finding a new apartment, they sought advice from a local advocacy group, which was able to get them a meeting with a lawyer they worked with, who revealed the iron-clad terminology in the contract that declared that \"No changes may be made to this contract unless both parties consent to the proposed changes.\"",

    "description": "Today, we're going to start with the comment before the method. /** * The topology type of primitives to render. (optional) * Default: 4 * Valid values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] * * @param mode The mode to set * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the given value does not meet * the given constraints * */ This comes from Krzysztof. As much as I dislike these JavaDoc style comments (they mostly repeat information I can get from the signature!), this one is promising. It tells me the range of values, and what happens when I exceed that range, what the default is, and it tells me that the value is optional. In short, from the comment alone I have a good picture of what the implementation looks like. With some caveats, mind you- because that's a set of magic numbers in there. No constants, no enum, just magic numbers. That's worrying. Let's look at the implementation. public void setMode(Integer mode) { if (mode == null) { this.mode = mode; return ; } if (((((((mode!= 0)\u0026\u0026(mode!= 1))\u0026\u0026(mode!= 2))\u0026\u0026(mode!= 3))\u0026\u0026(mode!= 4))\u0026\u0026(mode!= 5))\u0026\u0026(mode!= 6)) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(((\"Invalid value for mode: \"+ mode)+ \", valid: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\")); } this.mode = mode; } This code isn't terrible. But there are all sorts of small details which flummox me. Now, again, I want to stress, had they used enums this method would be much simpler. But fine, maybe they had a good reason for not doing that. Let's set that aside. The obvious ugly moment here is that if condition. Did they not understand that and is a commutative operation? Or did they come to Java from LISP and miss their parentheses? Then, of course, there's the first if statement- the null check. Honestly, we could have just put that into the chain of the if condition below, and the behavior would have been the same, or they could have just used an Optional type, which is arguably the \"right\" option here. But now we're drifting into the same space as enums- if only they'd used the core language features, this would be simpler. Let's focus, instead, on one last odd choice: how they use whitespace. mode!= 0. This, more than anything, makes me think they are coming to Java from some other language. Something that uses glyphs in unusual ways, because why else would the operator only get one space on one side of it? Which also makes me think the null check was written by someone else- because they're inconsistent with it there. So no, this code isn't terrible, but it does make me wonder a little bit about how it came to be.

    "description": "Robert was diagnosing a problem in a reporting module. The application code ran a fairly simple query- SELECT field1, field2, field3 FROM report_table- so he foolishly assumed that it would be easy to understand the problem. Of course, the \"table\" driving the report wasn't actually a table, it was a view in the database. Most of our readers are familiar with how views work, but for those who have had been corrupted by NoSQL databases: database views are great- take a query you run often, and create it as an object in the database: CREATE VIEW my_report AS SELECT t1.someField as someField, t2.someOtherField as someOtherField FROM table1 t1 INNER JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.id Now you can query SELECT * FROM my_report WHERE someField \u003e 5. Like I said: great! Well, usually great. Well, sometimes great. Well, like anything else, with great power comes great responsibility. Robert dug into the definition of the view, only to find that the tables it queried were themselves views. And those were in turn, also views. All in all, there were nineteen layers of nested views. The top level query he was trying to debug had no real relation to the underlying data, because 19 layers of abstraction had been injected between the report and the actual data. Even better- many of these nested views queried the same tables, so data was being split up and rejoined together in non-obvious and complex ways. The view that caused Robert to reach out to us was this: ALTER VIEW [LSFDR].[v_ControlDate] AS SELECT GETDATE() AS controlDate --GETDATE() - 7 AS controlDate This query is simply invoking a built-in function which returns today's date. Why not just call the function? We can see that once upon a time, it did offset the date by seven days, making the control date a week earlier. So I suppose there's some readability in mytable m INNER JOIN v_ControlDate cd ON m.transactionDate \u003e cd.controlDate, but that readability also hides the meaning of control date. That's the fundamental problem of abstraction. We lose details and meaning, and end up with 19 layers of stuff to puzzle through. A more proper solution may have been to actually implement this as a function, not a view- FROM mytable m WHERE m.transactionDate \u003e getControlDate(). At least here, it's clear that I'm invoking a function, instead of hiding it deep inside of a view called from a view called from a view. In any case, I'd argue that the actual code we're looking at isn't the true WTF. I don't like this view, and I wouldn't implement it this way, but it doesn't make me go \"WTF?\" The context the view exists in, on the other hand, absolutely does. 19 layers! Is this a database or a Russian Honey Cake? The report, of course, didn't have any requirements defining its data. Instead, the users had worked with the software team to gradually tweak the output over time until it gave them what they believed they wanted. This meant actually changing the views to be something comprehensible and maintainable wasn't a viable option- changes could break the report in surprising and non-obvious ways. So Robert was compelled to suffer through and make the minimally invasive changes required to fix the view and get the output looking like what the users wanted. The real WTF? The easiest fix was to create another view, and join it in. Problems compound themselves over time. [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod. Restrict NuGet feed privileges with ProGet.
