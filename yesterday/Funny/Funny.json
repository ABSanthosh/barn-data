That deserves a gold star, a nap, and probably a cat or two curled on your lap for emeowtional support.Adulting is weird. One moment you're buying a rug and feeling proud, the next you're crying because someone finished your oat milk. But through it all, one thing has stayed constant: cats. Their little bleps. Their dramatic stares. Their chaotic 3 AM zoomies. Their refusal to respect personal space (but only when you're busy).These wholesome cat memes are like a fuzzy little blanket for your soul. They're here to remind you that even if your back hurts for no reason, even if your inbox has 87 unread emails, and even if your dinner is just vibes and cereal... you're doing okay. So take a break, breathe deep, and scroll through these almost-30-approved feline funnies.

    "description": "Purrsonally, we understand the desire to help every cat you meet. It's something instinctual in us. We see a cat on the street and we are swept up by the urge to take them home, feed them some tuna, and teach them to snuggle. However, not every cat needs saving, despite how they may look on the outside. Some cats have a pawsitively enjoyable neighborhood life, with one main family and several side-families that feed them, love them, and house them. You might be surprised how common it is for a cat to have multiple families.So, when the cat lover in this post wrote about how she wanted to save this cat from a life outside, we get it. However, she goes on to say that the cat is clean and well-cared for, so at what point does she need to convince herself that she's not actually saving the cat, but stealing it? We'll leave it to you to find out what happens in the end, but let's just say that everyone gets a purrfectly happy ending!Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly.

While it may seem like a fresh frontier of opportunity, where you can be a cubicle outlaw, riding a steed of Excel sheets, and dueling with your saloon rival on your lunch break, several rules must be abided by, or else the sanctity of order falls apart. For starters, replying to an email 30 seconds after receiving it is a big 'no-no' unless it's a specifically urgent matter. That person just checked this task off their To-Do list; there's no need to pile it right back onto the top. Other rules of the office are more nuanced. For example, you can't microwave fish in the communal space, you have to admire pictures of your fellow coworkers' children (when prompted), and you certainly can't finish the break room coffee without making a new pot. These are the laws of the office outlaws, and they must be abided... Or else.",

This employee, who rarely ever takes time off work, put in a PTO request months ago that was fully approved. It wasn't even a long vacation, but rather a three-day weekend to decompress as he was experiencing burnout. His supervisor approved it, and everything was set for a nice day off for the employee.Unfortunately, however, when the day finally came, the employee's temporary vacation was interrupted by frustration from his supervisor for not showing up to work. Clearly, she had forgotten that this was the day she approved months ago. One would think that after explaining this to her, she would have backed down and apologized… but nope! He was still written up. Keep scrolling below for the full story along with reactions from several members of the online community and a subsequent update from the employee!",

    "description": "Maybe we'll just try and read a book. That's a good way to spend your vacation. This can't possibly go badly! Original --Remy \"Have you had a chance to look at that JIRA ticket yet?\" Marge debated pretending she hadn't seen the Slack message yet—but, if she did, she knew Gary would just walk over to her desk and badger her further. In truth, she didn't want to look at the ticket: it was a low priority ticket, and worse, it only affected a small fraction of one client's customers, meaning it was likely to be some weird edge case bug nobody would ever run into again. Maybe if I ignore it long enough, it'll go away on its own, she thought. The client was a bookseller with a small but signifigant-to-them online presence; the software they used to sell books, including your standard e-commerce account functionality, was made by Marge's company. The bug was somewhere in the password reset feature: some customers, seemingly at random, were unable to use the password reset link the software emailed out. Marge pulled up the ticket, looking over the half-hearted triage work that had been done before it landed on her desk to solve. The previous guy had pulled logs and figured out that all the customers who were complaining were using the same ISP based out of Germany. He'd recommended reaching out to them, but had been transferred to another division before he'd gotten around to it. When Marge realized that the contact information was all in German, she almost gave up then and there. But with the magic of Google Translate, she managed to get in touch with a representative via email. After a bit of back and forth, she noticed this gem in one of his (translated) replies: We want to display mails in our webmail client as close to the original as possible. Since most mails are HTML formatted, the client supports the full HTTP protocol and can display (almost) all HTML tags. Unfortunately, this means that \"evil\" JS-Content in such mails can do all kinds of stuff in the browser and therefore on the customer's PC. To avert this, all mails are processed by a \"SafeBrowsing\"-module before they are displayed, to recognize and circumvent such manipulations. One of those security measures is the recognition of js-modules that begin with \"on...\", since that are mostly js functions that are triggered by some event in the browser. Our \"countermeasure\" is to just replace \"on...\" with \"no...\" before the HTML content is sent to the rendering process. Marge frowned at the answer for a bit, something nagging at her mind. \"There's no way,\" she murmured as she pulled up the access logs. Sure enough, the url for the reset link was something like https://bookseller.com?oneTimeToken=deadbeef ... and the customers in question had accessed https://bookseller.com?noeTimeToken=deadbeef instead. A few lines of code and it was resolved: a conditional would check for the incorrect query string parameter and copy the token to the correct query string parameter instead. Marge rolled her eyes, merged her change into the release branch, and finally, at long last, closed that annoying low-priority ticket once and for all. hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); code { font-family: Consolas, monospace; } [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod.
