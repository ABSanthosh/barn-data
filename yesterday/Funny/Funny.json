    "description": "This contractor proved the value of his time by invoicing a company for wasting it. Higher-ups in the company always seem to think that meetings are more important than they are, but have you ever considered why? While the workers—the ones in the field actually doing the job of the company—are the ones with their boots on the ground, familiarizing themselves with every nuance of the job site. The suits in hardhats have no clue what's going on on a daily basis, so they need those meetings to catch themselves up to speed. Alas, once again I'll say it—most meetings can be summarized in a quick email. But for the big bosses, that's just too much effort. So when an advising contractor was told he had to be onsite for every team meeting every day, he decided to see if the company he was working for truly believed their meetings had value… Monetary value. Keep scrolling to see how this guy spent weeks billing his foreman for overtime hours, expensing his malicious compliance and ultimately earning his freedom to work at his own discretion.",

    "description": "We all make silly mistakes now and again—especially when we're under pressure. Have you ever spent 10 embarrassing seconds trying to \"push\" your way into a building with a \"pull\" door? Or maybe as you're scoping out a store and searching for the changing room, you just can't find it, so you ask an employee and, lo and behold, there's a giant sign above your head pointing you to it. And if you're a modern person using this new-fangled technology called an iPhone, you might pay for a lot of your stuff via tap-to-pay. I'm obsessed with the feature, which never fails to make me feel like I'm in a futuristic sci-fi movie. Of course, not everywhere takes tap-to-pay, and you have to pull out your wallet and use your good old-fashioned credit card. Do you swipe? Probably not, this is current year, after all. Do you tap? Maybe. Do you insert the chip? Also maybe. There may be signs to guide you, but we've all felt the pressure of trying to get the card to work while the bored cashier glares at us. It can get so awkward… please, just let us tap that phone and avoid our old ways. Next, read about the bride-to-be who kicked out a bachelorette party guest who spent $2,000+ on the trip: 'I snapped, and the room went silent.'",

    "description": "The beautiful thing about the CDS (also know as the iconic and impeccable Cat Distribution System) is that it can hit you at any time. You never see it coming. A cat can adopt you when you go on a walk, just walking up to you, choosing you and making you theirs. A cat might jump into your car and leave you with absolutely no choice but to take them with you, no matter where it is that you are going. A momma cat might show up at your door with kittens, and then, you will simply have to adopt them all. That's how it works. Even on a simple, short, pizza run, you are not safe from the CDS. Not that you would want to be safe from it. Getting chosen by the CDS is an honor, and having an adorable stray cat jump into your loving arms and agree to go with your wherever you are going while you are on a pizza run is just about the best thing that could happen to anyone.",

However, there is the occasional mix-up. We're not mad about it, in fact, the mix-up usually ends up being better than what we ordered in the first place. It's the darndest thing, really. We open our package, turn around for one second, and poof! All of a sudden, a cat is in our package instead of what we ordered!We're not sure what kind of sorcery this is, but it's purrfectly silly and we love it. These packages may not have what we ordered, but they do contain four cat paws and a whole lot of love, so that's better than anything we could have ordered in the first place. Whatever you're doing Amazon, keep doing it. It's pawsitively meowgical. Scroll down to see all of these boxes below that meowgically made some kitties appear. It's almost too silly to believe!",

To start off our WTFreitag, Reinier B. complains \"I did not specify my gender since it's completely irrelevant when ordering a skateboard for my daughter. That does not mean it is correct to address me as Dear Not specified.\" I wonder (sincerely) if there is a common German-language personal letter greeting for \"Dear somebody of unknown gender\". I don't think there is one for English. \"To Whom It May Concern\" is probably the best we can do.   \"A coworker shared this phishing email he got,\" reported Adam R. \"Even the scammers have trouble with their email templating variable names too.\" (It's there at the end).   Mathematically-minded Marcel V. thinks these numbers don't figure. \"The update process of my Overwatch game left me wondering. I am quite certain my computer does not have 18 Exabytes of harddisk space to reclaim. However, if bytes were meant, then how is it trying to reclaim the last .65 bytes??\"   Big Spender Jeff W. humblebrags \"If you have to ask, you can't afford it.\"   Finishing up for the week, Bruce R. signs off with \"This dialog from CNN seems a little overdone.\"   [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.

It being my last day however, here's a classic We'll take this one in parts. First, every element of the UI the user can navigate to is marked with an enum, defined thus: enum UiItem { SectionA, SectionB, SectionC,...SectionG } These names are not anonymized, so already I hate it. But it's the next enum that starts my skin crawling: enum SecurityUiItem { SectionA = UiItem.SectionA, SectionB = UiItem.SectionB, ... SectionG = UiItem.SectionG } A SecurityUiItem is a different type, but the values are identical to UiItem. These enums are used when trying to evaluate role-based permissions for access, and that code looks like this: if ((currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionA) \u0026\u0026 currentAccess[SecurityUiItem.SectionA] != AccessLevel.NoAccess)) return UiItem.SectionA; else if (!currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionB) || (currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionB) \u0026\u0026 currentAccess[SecurityUiItem.SectionB] != AccessLevel.NoAccess)) return UiItem.SectionB; else if (!currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionC) || (currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionC) \u0026\u0026 currentAccess[SecurityUiItem.SectionC] != AccessLevel.NoAccess)) return UiItem.SectionC; ..... else if (!currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionG) || (currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionG) \u0026\u0026 currentAccess[SecurityUiItem.SectionG] != AccessLevel.NoAccess)) return UiItem.SectionG; else return UiItem.Unknown; Honestly, I don't hate the idea of having one data type representing the actual UI objects and a separate data type which represents permissions, and having a function which can map between these two things. But this is a perfect example of a good idea executed poorly. I also have to wonder about the fall-through pattern. If I have access to SectionA, I only seem to get SectionA out of this function. Are these permissions hierarchical? I have no idea, but I suspect there's a WTF underpinning this whole thing. Congratulations on Kirill's last day. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.
