    "description": "Neighbors often ask one another for favors. There does not necessarily have to be any reciprocation, but there is a general understanding that residents who can help one another out should. However, when one of those neighbors assumes that you will go out of your way to help them as if you work for them, that's a different story. In these instances, doing something out of the goodness of your heart feels far too generous. After all, generosity is a two-way street. Sure, not every act of neighborly kindness needs to be reciprocated, but if you feel like your neighbor would never return the favor if the roles were reversed, you're probably right. Most folks who find themselves in these situations, as this author did, are easily taken advantage of because of their good deeds, but that cycle needs to be broken eventually.

    "description": "If you've never woken up in the middle of the night to something crashing and breaking in the middle of the night, have you ever really owned a cat? One of the first things you learns as an owner of a fluffy feline is that they are equally as chaotic as they are cute. They will snuggle with you one second, then zoomie off into another room at the speed of light and start climbing your curtains like their own purrsonal jungle gym. And yet, we still love them.Cats are not like dogs. Dogs are trainable - you can train a dog to be a better pet. Cats, not so much. Sure, they can be taught a few things, but they're going to remain a cat their whole lives, meaning they will be both your angel and your devil. It's part of the package, you have to take the feisty with the fluffy. If you don't believe us, we have plenty of cute and chaotic cat memes as evidence for our point. But for now, enjoy these hissterical pictures of cats being absolute agents of adorable anarchy. Or, for short, cats just being cats.",

    "description": "Mark sends us a very simple Java function which has the job of parsing an integer from a string. Now, you might say, \"But Java has a built in for that, Integer.parseInt,\" and have I got good news for you: they actually used it. It's just everything else they did wrong. private int makeInteger(String s) { int i=0; try { Integer.parseInt(s); } catch (NumberFormatException e) { i=0; return i; } i=Integer.parseInt(s); return i; } This function is really the story of variable i, the most useless variable ever. It's doing its best, but there's just nothing for it to do here. We start by setting i to zero. Then we attempt to parse the integer, and do nothing with the result. If it fails, we set i to zero again, just for fun, and then return i. Why not just return 0? Because then what would poor i get to do? Assuming we didn't throw an exception, we parse the input again, storing its result in i, and then return i. Again, we treat i like a child who wants to help paint the living room: we give it a dry brush and a section of wall we're not planning to paint and let it go to town. Nothing it does matters, but it feels like a participant. Now, Mark went ahead and refactored this function basically right away, into a more terse and clear version: private int makeInteger(String s) { try { return Integer.parseInt(s); } catch (NumberFormatException e) { return 0; } } He went about his development work, and then a few days later came across makeInteger reverted back to its original version. For a moment, he wanted to be mad at someone for reverting his change, but no- this was in an entirely different class. With that information, Mark went and did a search for makeInteger in the code, only to find 39 copies of this function, with minor variations. There are an unknown number of copies of the function where the name is slightly different than makeInteger, but a search for Integer.parseInt implies that there may be many more.

    "description": "Frank inherited some code that reads URLs from a file, and puts them into a collection. This is a delightfully simple task. What could go wrong? static String[] readFile(String filename) { String record = null; Vector vURLs = new Vector(); int recCnt = 0; try { FileReader fr = new FileReader(filename); BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr); record = new String(); while ((record = br.readLine()) != null) { vURLs.add(new String(record)); //System.out.println(recCnt + \": \" + vURLs.get(recCnt)); recCnt++; } } catch (IOException e) { // catch possible io errors from readLine() System.out.println(\"IOException error reading \" + filename + \" in readURLs()!\\n\"); e.printStackTrace(); } System.out.println(\"Reading URLs ...\\n\"); int arrCnt = 0; String[] sURLs = new String[vURLs.size()]; Enumeration eURLs = vURLs.elements(); for (Enumeration e = vURLs.elements() ; e.hasMoreElements() ;) { sURLs[arrCnt] = (String)e.nextElement(); System.out.println(arrCnt + \": \" + sURLs[arrCnt]); arrCnt++; } if (recCnt != arrCnt++) { System.out.println(\"WARNING: The number of URLs in the input file does not match the number of URLs in the array!\\n\\n\"); } return sURLs; } // end of readFile() So, we start by using a FileReader and a BufferedReader, which is the basic pattern any Java tutorial on file handling will tell you to do. What I see here is that the developer responsible didn't fully understand how strings work in Java. They initialize record to a new String() only to immediately discard that reference in their while loop. They also copy the record by doing a new String which is utterly unnecessary. As they load the Vector of strings, they also increment a recCount variable, which is superfluous since the collection can tell you how many elements are in it. Once the Vector is populated, they need to copy all this data into a String[]. Instead of using the toArray function, which is built in and does that, they iterate across the Vector and put each element into the array. As they build the array, they increment an arrCnt variable. Then, they do a check: if (recCnt != arrCnt++). Look at that line. Look at the post-increment on arrCnt, despite never using arrCnt again. Why is that there? Just for fun, apparently. Why is this check even there? The only way it's possible for the counts to not match is if somehow an exception was thrown after vURLs.add(new String(record)); but before recCount++, which doesn't seem likely. Certainly, if it happens, there's something worse going on. Now, I'm going to be generous and assume that this code predates Java 8- it just looks old. But it's worth noting that in Java 8, the BufferedReader class got a lines() function which returns a Stream that can be converted directly toArray, making all of this code superfluous, but also, so much of this code is just superfluous anyway. Anyway, for a fun game, start making the last use of every variable be a post-increment before it goes out of scope.
