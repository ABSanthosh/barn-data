That is a known fact that, somehow, not everyone seems to know. You may be going through a completely ordinary day when, our of nowhere, a kitten will jump into your lap (and your life) and suddenly, you will find yourself adopting a tiny feline. That's how it happens, and that is how it happened here. Out of nowhere, as this man was walking outside, this kitten found him and adopted him. Yes, in that order. And you can see how much love this man has for this itty bitty kitten. Everything he does, he does for her. And she clearly loves him too, riding on his shoulder, enjoying his music, napping on him. This is a match made in kitty heaven, and we cannot wait to see this fluffy cutie star in this man's next music video.",

    "description": "This week of daylight saving was rough, right? It's amazing to think about how a little bit of hour-shifting during the night can cause this domino effect of fatigue. We cannot get used to it even by now. You know how we'd wish we could solve this? By turning into cats. If we were cats, we could sleep for at least 16 hours during the night when the time changed, so we wouldn't feel the clock moving and the repercussions of it. And even after we sleep like cats throughout the night (because we're cats, obviously) - we won't experience this weird jetlag afterward, because cats can sleep whenever and wherever they want.To get over this elongated jetlag we gathered these daylight saving defying cat memes - because dealing with life's hardship with cat memes is the best way to deal with anything. You might start with some sleepy cat memes, but you'll see very soon that every silly little cat meme can help you laugh and get through this weird jetlag.",

It's also the recipe for a breakup in the making.Here's the thing: it's important in any relationship to have independent activities. One should not have one's entire social life tied to partnership. For this couple, \"bro nights\" are probably necessary for the 26-year-old boyfriend, and it's a good thing that these two have designated socializing that they do independently of one another. That being said, the fact that he cannot seem to afford these gatherings without the help of his 24-year-old girlfriend speaks to a larger problem in the relationship. Furthermore, the fact that he had the audacity to ask her to pay for him and all his friends when she herself would not be invited to said \"bro night\" is even worse!",

    "description": "Many years ago, JP joined a Ruby project. This was in the heyday of Ruby, when every startup on Earth was using it, and if you weren't building your app on Rails, were you even building an app? Now, Ruby offers a lot of flexibility. One might argue that it offers too much flexibility, especially insofar as it permits \"monkey patching\": you can always add new methods to an existing class, if you want. Regardless of the technical details, JP and the team saw that massive flexibility and said, \"Yes, we should use that. All of it!\" As these stories usually go, that was fine- for awhile. Then one day, a test started failing because a class name wasn't defined. That was already odd, but what was even odder is that when they searched through the code, that class name wasn't actually used anywhere. So yes, there was definitely no class with that name, but also, there was no line of code that was trying to instantiate that class. So where was the problem? def controller_class(name) \"#{settings.app_name.camelize}::Controllers\".constantize.const_get(\"#{name.to_s.camelize}\") end def model_class(name) \"#{settings.app_name.camelize}\".constantize.const_get(\"#{name.to_s.camelize}\") end def resource_class(name) \"#{settings.app_name.camelize}Client\".constantize.const_get(\"#{name.to_s.camelize}\") end It happened because they were dynamically constructing the class names from a settings field. And not just in this handful of lines- this pattern occurred all over the codebase. There were other places where it referenced a different settings field, and they just hadn't encountered the bug yet, but knew that it was only a matter of time before changing a settings file was going to break more functionality in the application. They wisely rewrote these sections to not reference the settings, and dubbed the pattern the \"Caramelize Pattern\". They added that to their coding standards as a thing to avoid, and learned a valuable lesson about how languages provide footguns. Since today's April Fool's Day, consider the prank the fact that everyone learned their lesson and corrected their mistakes. I suppose that has to happen at least sometimes.

    "description": "Legacy systems are hard to change, and even harder to eliminate. You can't simply do nothing though; as technology and user expectations change, you need to find ways to modernize and adapt the legacy system. That's what happened to Alicia's team. They had a gigantic, spaghetti-coded, monolithic application that was well past drinking age and had a front-end to match. Someone decided that they couldn't touch the complex business logic, but what they could do was replace the frontend code by creating an adapter service; the front end would call into this adapter, and the adapter would execute the appropriate methods in the backend. Some clever coder named this \"Backend for Frontend\" or \"BFF\". It was not anyone's BFF. For starters, this system didn't actually allow you to just connect a UI to the backend. No, that'd be too easy. This system was actually a UI generator. The way this works is that you feed it a schema file, written in JSON. This file specifies what input elements you want, some hints for layout, what validation you want the UI to perform, and even what CSS classes you want. Then you compile this as part of a gigantic .NET application, and deploy it, and then you can see your new UI. No one likes using it. No one is happy that it exists. Everyone wishes that they could just write frontends like normal people, and not use this awkward schema language. All that is to say, when Alicia's co-worker stood up shortly before lunch, said, \"I'm taking off the rest of the day, BFF has broken me,\" it wasn't particularly shocking to hear- or even the first time that'd happened. Alicia, not heeding the warning inherent in that statement, immediately tracked down that dev's last work, and tried to understand what had been so painful. \"minValue\": 1900, \"maxValue\": 99, This, of course, had to be a bug. Didn't it? How could the maxValue be lower than the minValue? Let's look at the surrounding context. { \"type\": \"eventValueBetweenValuesValidator\", \"eventType\": \"CalendarYear\", \"minValue\": 1900, \"maxValue\": 99, \"isCalendarBasedMaxValue\": true, \"message\": \"CalendarYear must be between {% raw %}{{minValue}}{% endraw %} and {% raw %}{{maxValue}}{% endraw %}.\" } I think this should make it perfectly clear what's happening. Oh, it doesn't? Look at the isCalendarBasedMaxValue field. It's true. There, that should explain everything. No, it doesn't? You're just more confused? The isCalendarBasedMaxValue says that the maxValue field should not be treated as a literal value, but instead, is the number of years in the future relative to the current year which are considered valid. This schema definition says \"accept all years between 1900 and 2124 (at the time of this writing).\" Next year, that top value goes up to 2125. Then 2126. And so on. As features go, it's not a terrible feature. But the implementation of the feature is incredibly counter-intuitive. At the end of the day, this is just bad naming: (ab)using min/max to do something that isn't really a min/max validation is the big issue here. Alicia writes: I couldn't come up with something more counterintuitive if I tried. Oh, don't sell yourself short, Alicia. I'm sure you could write something far, far worse if you tried. The key thing here is that clearly, nobody tried- they just sorta let things happen and definitely didn't think too hard about it. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.
