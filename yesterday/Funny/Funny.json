    "description": "Having a good or bad landlord is totally up to chance. It doesn't matter how expensive your home is, some landlords are cool, and others are just total menaces. Think about how a landlord might handle a common tenant issue. Let's say that there's a crack in the ceiling, and every time it rains, you get rainwater on your forehead as you lay in bed. A tenant might text or call their landlord to mention this to them, and then they just have to wait with baited breath for that landlord to answer before the next rainstorm. There are a few ways this can go. A lot of landlords will say something like, \"I'll send my son up to take a look at it,\" and then sometime within 3-10 days, a random guy will show up at your door and try to fix the ceiling. That's a pretty good landlord, though. A worse landlord will tell you to fix it on your own, or avoid messaging you back, or they'll promise to take a look at it, then never get around to it. Just like the quality of your neighbors can impact your happiness with your living situation, having a frustrating landlord can also really irk you, no matter how nice your home is otherwise. Up next, have a look at the hotel guests who are demanding refunds, like one person who had to sleep on \"a sofa bed in a conference room.\"",

For those of you who are eagerly anticipating the upcoming third season of \"The White Lotus,\" there is no need to wait because there are countless clueless rich people online and all around us if you look carefully enough.These are the kinds of people who stress about not being able to take their personal cleaning crew on vacation with them.

The people who have never known a universe in which they have had to take part in doing their own taxes.

    "description": "Greetings, pals! Let's chat about being a cat parent. Being a pet parent brings countless joys and cherished moments, but it also comes with its share of heartaches and worries. Among these challenges, few are as devastating as when a beloved pet goes missing - a situation that one family experienced for an incredible 13 years. In a remarkable turn of events, their story transformed from tragedy to triumph when they received an unexpected call from a veterinary clinic 20 kilometers away.The clinic discovered a ginger cat whose microchip revealed a long-lost connection—it was Milo, who had vanished without a trace when his owner was just 12 years old. Despite the passage of over a decade, during which he survived on his own and was eventually found near an abandoned house, Milo proved to be surprisingly resilient. Though facing some health challenges, this determined 15-year-old warrior has finally made his way back to his family. We can't help but melt when reading about Milo, he is a true feline hero.",

In fact, we think that maybe we should be in a worst mood, considering some stuff that is happening, but we are not. We are chill, it is Sunday, and we have decided to take fate into our own hands and make sure that next week is going to be a friggin' fabulous one for us, no matter what else may be happening. And the first step to make that happen is enjoying a bunch of hissterical cat memes first thing in the morning. Every single week, we bring you a bunch of silly new cat memes to laugh at directly from the depths of X, or Twitter, or however you want to call this platform. We bring it to you because the content there is and furrever will be iconic. So, sit back, enjoy the extra time that you can spend resting in bed or drinking your coffee, and have a purrfect day!",

For example, if you are A Russo Brother - either one - I would absolutely love it if they came back and made a cool Marvel movie. Disney certainly doesn't know how. Disney has been wandering in the fucking woods since Endgame, and the movie that called them out for doing exactly that made 1.3 billion dollars. I want these Russo gentlemen back because they made Captain America: Winter Soldier. That's why I wanted them to do the other stuff; because they make good things. I don't need some kind of substrate underneath it. It's a craft. They're the masters of it. That's plenty for me.",

    "description": "Roger took on a contract to fix up a PHP website. During the negotiations, he asked some questions about the design, like, \"Is it object-oriented or more procedural?\" \"No, it's PHP,\" said the developer. Which about sums it up, I suppose. Have some date handling code: function MnameToMnumber($mname) //takes month name 'January' and returns month number '01' { if($mname == 'January'){$mnum = '01';} elseif($mname == 'February'){$mnum = '02';} elseif($mname == 'March'){$mnum = '03';} elseif($mname == 'April'){$mnum = '04';} elseif($mname == 'May'){$mnum = '05';} elseif($mname == 'June'){$mnum = '06';} elseif($mname == 'July'){$mnum = '07';} elseif($mname == 'August'){$mnum = '08';} elseif($mname == 'September'){$mnum = '09';} elseif($mname == 'October'){$mnum = '10';} elseif($mname == 'November'){$mnum = '11';} elseif($mname == 'December'){$mnum = '12';} return $mnum; } function MnumberToMname($mname) //takes month number '01' and returns month name '01' { if($mnum= '01'){$mname = 'January';} elseif($mnum= '02'){$mname = 'February';} elseif($mnum= '03'){$mname = 'March';} elseif($mname == 'April'){$mnum = '04';} elseif($mnum= '05'){$mname = 'May';} elseif($mnum= '06'){$mname = 'June';} elseif($mnum= '07'){$mname = 'July';} elseif($mnum= '08'){$mname = 'August';} elseif($mnum= '09'){$mname = 'September';} elseif($mnum= '10'){$mname = 'October';} elseif($mnum= '11'){$mname = 'November';} elseif($mnum= '12'){$mname = 'December';} return $mname; } So, for starters, I \"love\" the use of Whitesmiths indenting. I don't think I've seen this in the wild. (I predict the comments section will be links to articles where I have seen this in the wild). Beyond that, there's nothing terribly surprising here, in terms of bad date handling code, with a few small exceptions. First is their insistence on the conversion itself being stringly typed: January isn't month 1, but \"01\". But more notable: MnumberToMname just doesn't work. They're using the assignment operator instead of the equality operator. At least, for all the cases where they're doing the correct comparison direction. A stray \"name to number\" conversion is lurking in April. Not that it matters- this will always return January. [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod.
