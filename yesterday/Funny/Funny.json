    "description": "We're taught from a young age that our sweat and tears will amount to something so long as we keep at the grind. This is partly true, but not in the way that you're thinking. Relying on others for praise, especially companies that lack loyalty, is the wrong way to roll nowadays. Nobody wants to believe they can keep at the grind for nearly three years and still get inconvenienced and taken advantage of by their employer, but that's the reality of things. We're all cogs in the machine, unwilling to let go because that means we can no longer eat and afford rent. Gotta love life.The employee who posted this next story explains that a coworker she helped hire and train received a larger bonus than the one she received, and she suspects this might be due to her maternity leave. Though she took a leave of absence, she explains that she did the work of two people leading up to her departure and upon arriving back at the office. Moving forward, she doesn't know if she has the right to confront her boss… but we say, \"Why not?\"Scroll below to read the full story.",

    "description": "If you are on good terms with your parents, the last thing you want to talk to them about is inquiries about their will and inheritance. No one wants to come across as money-obsessed, especially not in front of those you care for the most, like your mom and dad. You want to believe that when the time comes, your parents will make the right choices and will not leave anyone behind, no matter what happens up until they get to the metaphorical finish line.When parents reach a certain age, they might start bringing up their will themselves. What they plan on leaving to whom, how they intend to divide their belongings, and even ask each of their children if there is something they wish they could get. However, all of these conversations are usually worth nothing if they are not backed up by writing, by a legal document that ensures everyone gets what they are owed. Without it, the only thing one can expect is pure family chaos.",

Cuddling with your cat, chilling with your cat, sleeping next to your cat and waking up with them beside you… there is something so wholesome about it, so sweet. We love it. But we can't help but wonder, on those mornings that we wake up, and our cat, who we fell asleep next to, is no longer next to us… what were our cats doing in the middle of the night? Now, this urge never quite won over us. We did not, in fact, set up a camera to see what our cats to at night, but if we were this couple, we totally would have. Because not only do they have two clingy cats living with them, they also have three huskies - all of whom are allowed on the bed. So, one day, this couple finally decided to set up that camera and found out exactly what all of their pets do when they're sleeping.",

    "description": "Oh, Monday. What a meowing day. It's inevitable, but we wish Monday was a choise day. Like, are you ready for Monday? If you're not ready, skip it. Just like that. But unfortunately this isn't how Mondays work.When we think of skipping days, Mondays or otherwise, we think of the ultimate day skippers - cats. Cats are so chill, and cats can sleep for most of the day, so they can simply skip a day if they don't want to take part in it. Cats are so unbothered sometimes that makes us jealous. We also want to be completely unbothered by Monday, for instance. Doesn't it make you want to be a cat?If some magic would turn us into cats the first thing we'd do is skip the nexy Monday. What a great power. But with great power comes great responsibility… and that's completely irrelevant here. Cast the Monday mellows away, you funky little floofy feline. Enjoy this not-Monday for as long as you want. Well, at least until Tuesday.Until Tuesday actually comes to replace this Monday, you can enjoy these cheesy cat memes to pass the time. It's the human way of skipping Mondays.",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/a-double-date",
    "description": "Alice picked up a ticket about a broken date calculation in a React application, and dropped into the code to take a look. There, she found this: export function calcYears(date) { return date \u0026\u0026 Math.floor((new Date() - new Date(date).getTime()) / 3.15576e10) } She stared at it for awhile, trying to understand what the hell this was doing, and why it was dividing by three billion. Also, why there was a \u0026\u0026 in there. But after staring at it for a few minutes, the sick logic of the code makes sense. getTime returns a timestamp in milliseconds. 3.15576e10 is the number of milliseconds in a year. So the Math.floor() expression just gets the difference between two dates as a number of years. The \u0026\u0026 is just a coalescing operator- the last truthy value gets returned, so if for some reason we can't calculate the number of years (because of bad input, perhaps?), we just return the original input date, because that's a brillant way to handle errors. As bizarre as this code is, this isn't the code that was causing problems. It works just fine. So why did Alice get a ticket? She spent some more time puzzling over that, while reading through the code, only to discover that this calcYears function was used almost everywhere in the code- but in one spot, someone decided to write their own. if (birthday) { let year = birthday?.split('-', 1) if (year[0] != '') { let years = new Date().getFullYear() - year[0] return years } } So, this function also works, and is maybe a bit more clear about what it's doing than the calcYears. But note the use of split- this assumes a lot about the input format of the date, and that assumption isn't always reliable. While calcYears still does unexpected things if you fail to give it good input, its accepted range of inputs is broader. Here, if we're not in a date format which starts with \"YYYY-\", this blows up. After spending hours puzzling over this, Alice writes: I HATE HOW NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO CODE [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod. Restrict NuGet feed privileges with ProGet. Learn more.",
