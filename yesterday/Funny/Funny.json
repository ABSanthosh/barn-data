    "description": "Last time Gabriel and his inheritors went wild on wargaming, part of the reason it fell apart was that they dug too greedily and too deep. Any one of the wargames that Games Workshop makes could be your entire life - they could certainly be your entire paycheck. They were playing Kill Team and Warhammer 40k 9th edition at the same time, and it didn't help that each of these games shares some language that doesn't actually mean the same thing in the different contexts. Plus, the 9th Edition of 40k just isn't as fun as the new one - they got a taste of 10 and they're sticking with it, despite my most fervent attempts.",

    "description": "The most common type of submission Error'd receives are simple, stupid, data problems on Amazon. The text doesn't match the image, the pricing is goofy, or some other mixup that are just bound to happen with a database of zillions of products uploaded by a plethora of barely-literate mountain village drop-shippers. So I don't usually feature them, preferring to find something with at least a chance of being a creative new bug. But I uncovered a story by Mark Johansen about his favorite author, and decided that since so many of you obviously DO think online retail flubs are noteworthy, what the heck. Here is Mark's plain-text story, and a handful of bungled products. They're not exactly bugs, but at least some of them are about bugs. \"I guess I missed your item about failings of AI, but here's one of my favorites: Amazon regularly sends me emails of books that their AI thinks I might want to read, presumably based on books that I've bought from them in the past. So recently I got an email saying, \"The newest book by an author you've read before!\" And this new book was by ... Ernest Hemingway. Considering that he died almost 60 years ago, it seemed unlikely that he was still writing. Or where he was sending manuscripts from. Lest you wonder, it turned out it was a collection of letters he wrote when he was, like, actually alive. The book was listed as authored by Ernest Hemingway rather than under the name of whomever compiled the letters.\" What do we all think? Truly an Error'd, or just some publisher taking marketing advice from real estate agents? Let me know. A while back, Christian E. \"Wanted to order some groceries from nemlig.com. So I saw the free (labelled GRATIS) product and pressed the info button and this popped up. Says that I can get the product delivered from the 1st of January (today is the 2nd of march). Have to wait for a while then...\" Not too much longer, Christian.   Reliable Michael R. muttered \"msofas either have their special math where 5% always is GBP10 or they know already what I want to buy.\"   \"Do not feed to vegetarians.\" warns Jeffrey B.   \"Not sure how this blue liquid works for others, but there has been no sucking here yet,\" reports Matthias.   \"Nice feature but I am not sure if it can fit in my notebook,\" writes Tiger Fok.   Lady-killer Bart-Jan is preparing for Friday night on the town, apparently. Knock 'em dead, Bart! \"It says 'Fragrance for Men'. Which is fine, as long as it also does a good job deterring the female mosquitoes.\"   [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.

    "description": "Damiano's company had more work than staff, and opted to hire a subcontractor. When hiring on a subcontractor, you could look for all sorts of things. Does their portfolio contain work similar to what you're asking them to do? What's the average experience of their team? What are the agreed upon code quality standards for the contract? You could do that, or you could hire the cheapest company. Guess which one Damiano's company did? If you're not sure, look at this code: if(jQuery('table').hasClass('views-view-grid')){ var EPid= \".views-view-grid\"; jQuery(EPid +' td').each(function(){ if(!jQuery(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().hasClass('view-article-in-right-sidebar') \u0026\u0026 !jQuery(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().hasClass('view-offers-in-right-sidebar')){ var title = jQuery(this).find(\"h2 a\").html(); var body = jQuery(this).find(\".field-name-body\").html(); var datetime = jQuery(this).find(\".field-name-field-event-date-time\").html(); var flyer = jQuery(this).find(\".field-name-field-flyer a\").attr(\"href\"); var imageThumb = jQuery(this).find(\".field-name-field-image-thumb\").html(); var readMore = 'jQuery(this).find(\"h2 a\").attr(\"href\")+'\" class=\"read-more\"\u003eREAD MORE'; var str = ''; if(title != null \u0026\u0026 title != \"\"){ if(imageThumb \u0026\u0026 imageThumb != \"\" \u0026\u0026 imageThumb != null) str = str + imageThumb; if(datetime \u0026\u0026 datetime != \"\" \u0026\u0026 datetime != null) str = str + ''+datetime+''; str = str + ''+title+''; str = str + body + ''; str = str + readMore; } if(flyer) str = str + ''\"\u003etype == \"events\"){ echo 'download the flyer'; }else {echo 'download the article';} ?\u003e'; str = str + ''; jQuery(this).children('.node').remove(); jQuery(this).append(str); } }); This was in a Drupal project. The developer appointed by the contractor didn't know Drupal at all, and opted to build all the new functionality by dropping big blobs of JavaScript code on top of it. There's so much to hate about this. We can start with the parent().parent() chains. Who doesn't love to make sure that your JavaScript code is extremely fragile against changes in the DOM, while at the same time making it hard to read or understand. I like that we create the EPid variable to avoid having a magic string inside our DOM query, only to still need to append a magic string to it. It hints at some programming by copy/paste. Then there's the pile of HTML-by-string-concatenation, which is always fun. But this couldn't be complete without this moment: type == \"events\"){ echo 'download the flyer'; }else {echo 'download the article';} ?\u003e Oh yeah, buried in this unreadable blob of JavaScript there's a little bonus PHP, just to make it a little spicier. The entire project came back from the contractor in an unusable state. The amount of re-work just to get it vaguely functional quickly outweighed any potential cost savings. And even after that work went it, it remained a buggy, unmaintainable mess. Did management learn their lesson? Absolutely not- they bragged about how cheaply they got the work done at every opportunity, and entered into a partnership agreement with the subcontractor. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.

    "description": "Siblings… Really, what is there that isn't to be said? They can be your best friends, your fiercest competitors, or just the most awful people you've ever had the displeasure of being acquainted with. This 25-year-old woman moved in with her 23-year-old sister, giving up her perfectly good apartment just to move in with her sister when her sister relocated to the city for work. Difficulties began to rise, and trouble brewed when her sister began performing \"harmless\" pranks. They started small with simple gaslighting and reorganization of belongings but escalated quickly to dangerous pranks, lighting items on fire, and even getting the woman arrested by telling neighbors that she was the sister's \"stalker.\"Not only is this sister being a terrible sister, by nature of their arrangement, but she's also being a terrible roommate, causing distress and actual danger to the person she's living with. The generation that was raised watching infuriatingly immature YouTube vloggers doing \"pranks\" for clicks on unsuspecting bystanders really needs to realize that you can't go around doing this in everyday life without serious consequences. And if pranks aren't fun and funny for everyone, they're really not funny at all—just annoying disturbances.",

    "description": "This homeowner got fired up after lamenting about his HOA fee-paying app online, only to find out that his exorbitant fees were amounting to nothing, instigating an all-out rebellion against his HOA board. Some HOAs can be helpful–managing landscaping maintenance, communal pools, and barbecue areas–but more often than not, they're a power vacuum and a money dump for homeowners who don't actually get a say in how their money is spent. I live in a complex with an HOA fee and until recently, we only paid a couple hundred dollars a month, which seemed entirely fair as they paid for all of the plant care, the pool, and other facilities (like the gym and BBQs). So I understand the rage this guy felt when the homeowner in our next story, who was strapped to a $600/month payment to his HOA, discovered that his fees went to absolutely nothing. Naturally, he snapped and went full-anarchist. Keep scrolling for the rage-inducing tale that'll leave you questioning your own HOAs ethics.",

    "description": "Cats are weird little creatures, goblins even. They goblin around with their strange behavior and we seem to accept it fully, embracing it like it's the best thing that could have happened to humanity. Because it is the best thing that happened to humanity. Cats are the goblinoids that humans didn't necessarily want, but definitely those we needed. We needed a fluffy floof friend with a weird but wholesome aura to hang out with us, so we could truly understand that weird and adorable are not contradicting concepts. Cats are both goofy goblins and cuddly babies, and it doesn't contradict - it's just a fact of life.Some wonderfully weird cat memes embody this sassy and strange cat aura, so it's no wonder we all love them so much. We gathered some of them right here, for all the cat pawrents who know what wonderfully weird cat behaviors we talk about, so we can all enjoy them.",
