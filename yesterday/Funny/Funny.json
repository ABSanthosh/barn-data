    "description": "Newborns are tiny, fragile, helpless things. Even leaving them lying in the wrong position, unable to reposition themselves, can be disastrous. Watching one, especially when you're inexperienced and not even an adult yourself, is understandably nerve-wracking.The brother's demand that his younger sister watch his newborn just because she offered to babysit at some point in the future is reminiscent of any other time you make an offer to do a favor for someone and they take the bounds of that favor way too far. Like offering to look after your friend's plants when they're away, and suddenly you're pet sitting and deep cleaning their house too. That moment of generosity was sorely regretted the entire time because the person just took it way too far. Surely she meant that she would watch her nephew at some point in the future, you know, when he was a toddler or something.Further, the obligation of parenting is just something you sign up for when you become a parent. The inconvenience of having to watch your child and miss things because of that is just a part of the deal, and you can't just take that out on your teenage sister because she's uncomfortable with your unreasonable request.",

We get our cats cool and expensive cat trees (only for the cats to sit in the boxes instead). We talk to our cats, we hug our cats, we sleep next to them… we love them, and we show that in our own nurturing ways. Of course, people remind us every once in a while, after seeing us interact with our cats, that our cats are, in fact, not our babies.

    "description": "We've talked about ASP .Net WebForms in the past. In this style of development, everything was event driven: click a button, and the browser sends an HTTP request to the server which triggers a series of events, including a \"Button Click\" event, and renders a new page. When ASP .Net launched, one of the \"features\" was a lazy repaint in browsers which supported it (aka, Internet Explorer), where you'd click the button, the page would render on the server, download, and then the browser would repaint only the changed areas, making it feel more like a desktop application, albeit a laggy one. This model didn't translate super naturally to AJAX style calls, where JavaScript updated only portions of the page. The .Net team added some hooks for it- special \"AJAX enabled\" controls, as well as helper functions, like __doPostBack, in the UI to generate URLs for \"postbacks\" to trigger server side execution. A postback is just a POST request with .NET specific state data in the body. All this said, Chris maintains a booking system for a boat rental company. Specifically, he's a developer at a company which the boat rental company hires to maintain their site. The original developer left behind a barnacle covered mess of tangled lines and rotting hull. Let's start with the view ASPX definition: \u003cscript\u003e function btnSave_Click() { if (someCondition) { //Trimmed for your own sanity //PostBack to Save Data into the Database. javascript:\u003c%#getPostBack()%\u003e; } else { return false; } } script\u003e \u003chtml\u003e \u003cbody\u003e \u003cinput type=\"button\" value=\" Save Booking \" id=\"btnSave\" class=\"button\" title=\"Save [Alt]\" onclick=\"btnSave_Click()\" /\u003e body\u003e html\u003e __doPostBack is the .NET method for generating URLs for performing postbacks, and specifically, it populates two request fields: __EVENTTARGET (the ID of the UI element triggering the event) and __EVENTARGUMENT, an arbitrary field for your use. I assume getPostBack() is a helper method which calls that. The code in btnSave_Click is as submitted, and I think our submitter may have mangled it a bit in \"trimming\", but I can see the goal is to ensure than when the onclick event fires, we perform a \"postback\" operation with some hard-coded values for __EVENTTARGET and __EVENTELEMENT. Or maybe it isn't mangled, and this code just doesn't work? I enjoy that the tool-tip \"title\" field specifies that it's \"[Alt]\" text, and that the name of the button includes extra whitespace to ensure that it's padded out to a good rendering size, instead of using CSS. But we can skip past this into the real meat. How this gets handled on the server side: Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Load '// Trimmed more garbage If Page.IsPostBack Then 'Check if save button has been Clicked. Dim eventArg As String = Request(\"__EVENTARGUMENT\") Dim offset As Integer = eventArg.IndexOf(\"@@@@@\") If (offset \u003e -1) Then 'this is an event that we raised. so do whatever you need to here. Save() End If End If End Sub From this, I conclude that getPostBack populates the __EVENTARGUMENT field with a pile of \"@\", and we use that to recognize that the save button was clicked. Except, and this is the important thing, if they populated the ID property with btnSave, then ASP .Net would automatically call btnSave_Click. The entire point of the __doPostBack functionality is that it hooks into the event handling pattern and acts just like any other postback, but lets you have JavaScript execute as part of sending the request. The entire application is a boat with multiple holes in it; it's taking on water and going down, and like a good captain, Chris is absolutely not going down with it and looking for a lifeboat. Chris writes: The thing in its entirety is probably one of the biggest WTFs I've ever had to work with. I've held off submitting because nothing was ever straight forward enough to be understood without posting the entire website. Honestly, I'm still not sure I understand it, but I do hate it.

    "description": "Eddie's company hired a Highly Paid Consultant to help them retool their systems for a major upgrade. Of course, the HPC needed more and more time, and the project ran later and later and ended up wildly over budget, so the HPC had to be released, and Eddie inherited the code. What followed was a massive crunch to try and hit absolutely hard delivery dates. Management didn't want their team \"rewriting\" the expensive code they'd already paid for, they just wanted \"quick fixes\" to get it live. Obviously, the HPC's code must be better than theirs, right? After release, a problem appeared in one of their sales related reports. The point-of-sale report was meant to deliver a report about which items were available at any given retail outlet, in addition to sales figures. Because their business dealt in a high volume of seasonal items, every quarter the list of items was expected to change regularly. The users weren't seeing the new items appear in the report. This didn't make very much sense- it was a report. The data was in the database. The report was driven by a view, also in the database, which clearly was returning the correct values? So the bug must be in the code which generated the report… If POSItemDesc = \"Large Sign\" Then grdResults.Columns.FromKey(\"FColumn12\").Header.Caption = \"Large Sign\" End If If POSItemDesc = \"Small Sign\" Then grdResults.Columns.FromKey(\"FColumn12\").Header.Caption = \"Small Sign\" End If If POSItemDesc = \"2x2 Hanging Sign\" Then grdResults.Columns.FromKey(\"FColumn12\").Header.Caption = \"2x2 Hanging Sign\" End If If POSItemDesc = \"1x1 Sign\" Then grdResults.Columns.FromKey(\"FColumn12\").Header.Caption = \"1x1 Sign\" End If '.........Snipping more of these........ If POSItemDesc = \"Light Thief\" Then grdResults.Columns.FromKey(\"FColumn12\").Header.Caption = \"Light Thief\" End If If POSItemDesc = \"Door Strike\" Then grdResults.Columns.FromKey(\"FColumn12\").Header.Caption = \"Door Strike\" End If First, it's worth noting that inside of the results grid display item, the HPC named the field FColumn12, which is such a wonderfully self documenting name, I'm surprised we aren't all using that everywhere. But the more obvious problem is that the list of possible items is hard-coded into the report; items which don't fit one of these if statements don't get displayed. At no point, did the person writing this see the pattern of \"I check if a field equals a string, and then set another field equal to that string,\" and say, \"maybe there's a better way?\" At no point, in the testing process, did anyone try this report with a new item? It was easy enough for Eddie to change the name of the column in the results grid, and replace all this code with a simpler: grdResults.Columns.FromKey(\"POSItem\").Header.Caption = POSItemDesc, which also had the benefit of actually working, but we're all left puzzling over why this happened in the first place. It's not like the HPC was getting paid per line of code. Right? Right? Of course not- no HPC would willingly be paid based on any metric that has an objective standard, even if the metric is dumb.
