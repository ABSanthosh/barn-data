    "description": "Dealing with parents as a teen is difficult, but navigating those relationships in the midst of divorce and infidelity presents even more of a challenge. While the ex-husband's new wife has been in this teen's life for 6 years or so, things are undoubly complex due to the nature of how they got together, and that length of time doesn't automatically mean that there's any closeness between them. It doesn't seem out of the question here that the ex-husband's new wife simply wants to seize her moment to solidify her \"place\" in her stepdaughter's life.At the end of the day, it's the daughter's event and a celebration of her and her parents' achievements. If she doesn't want someone involved in those celebrations, well, that's sort of up to her. Of course, there will be situations where the parents need to steer their kids onto the right course, but this isn't necessarily one of those times. Especially since the mother seems to be the primary caretaker here, it definitely falls to her to protect her daughter's wishes.",

    "description": "Kids will be kids, right? Growing up in the neighborhood, there was always that sense of adventure, whether it be running through backyards, playing hide-and-seek, or pretending to be superheroes. For a lot of us, those games were part of what made childhood so fun. We were constantly crafting made-up worlds in our imaginations, but one thing we weren't doing was actively digging up our neighbors' yards. At least not on purpose. Sure, there may have been the occasional tire track from taking a turn a little too hard on a bike, but we were never really out to destroy the grass or cause any lasting damage.It seems like this kid, however, has a different approach to \"imagination.\" In a suburban neighborhood, where everyone is just minding their own business, one 10-year-old has decided to take his pirate fantasy a bit too far. His treasure hunts are becoming a real headache for one neighbor, as wholesome as his pirate act may be. When he politely tried to confront his mom about the multiple holes on his property, he wasn't met with the response he was expecting.",

    "description": "We like to think that we were a pretty savvy teen, feline fam. It may have been over 20 years ago, but we were quite productive during our high school years. We studied hard to get into a good college, were the captain of our sports team, and pawticipated in many extra-curricular activities. But none of that, and we really mean none, could compare to what Robin Lee Graham did when he was a teenager. At the young age of 16 years old, he decided to set sail across the world, traveling over 33,000 nautical miles with no help except for the companionship of his cute sailor cats he brought with him.He faced many hardships along the way, including losing his mast shortly after departing, and even having to change boats midway due to extensive damage to his ship. He said, however, that the cats helped him deal with loneliness and feel comforted. So this proves it once and for all that cats are the best companions to have, right?

To begin with they have no boundaries or social awareness, making them poor team players and even worse when they receive negative feedback. Then you have the whole lack of impulse control, which as any factory worker will tell you is a one way ticket to living a short life. And then you add on top of all of this their terribly lacking persistence with regard to their jobs, and you get probably the worst workers on the planet.Especially when you consider that they can be petulantly persistent when it comes to food. So it should come as little surprise that working in a Pâwtisserie would be a poor hiring decision on the part of the owner.",

Crystal Reports is another one of those tools that lets non-developer, non-database savvy folks craft reports. Which, like so often happens, means that the users dig themselves incredible holes and need professional help to get back out, because at the end of the day, when the root problem is actually complicated, all the helpful GUI tools in the world can't solve it for you. Michael was in a similar position as I was, but for Michael, there was a five alarm fire. It was the end of the month, and a bunch of monthly sales reports needed to be calculated. One of the big things management expected to see was a year-over-year delta on sales, and they got real cranky if the line didn't go up. If they couldn't even see the line, they went into a full on panic and assumed the sales team was floundering and the company was on the verge of collapse. Unfortunately, the report was spitting out an error: \"A day number must be between 1 and the number of days in the month.\" Michael dug in, and found this \"delight\" inside of a function called one_year_ago: Local StringVar yearStr := Left({?ReportToDate}, 4); Local StringVar monthStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 5, 2); Local StringVar dayStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 7, 2); Local StringVar hourStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 9, 2); Local StringVar minStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 11, 2); Local StringVar secStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 13, 2); Local NumberVar LastYear; LastYear := ToNumber(YearStr) - 1; YearStr := Replace (toText(LastYear),'.00' , '' ); YearStr := Replace (YearStr,',' , '' ); //DateTime(year, month, day, hour, min, sec); //Year + Month + Day + Hour + min + sec; // string value DateTime(ToNumber(YearStr), ToNumber(MonthStr), ToNumber(dayStr), ToNumber(HourStr), ToNumber(MinStr),ToNumber(SecStr) ); We've all seen string munging in date handling before. That's not surprising. But what's notable about this one is the day on which it started failing. As stated, it was at the end of the month. But which month? February. Specifically, February 2024, a leap year. Since they do nothing to adjust the dayStr when constructing the date, they were attempting to construct a date for 29-FEB-2023, which is not a valid date. Michael writes: Yes, it's Crystal Reports, but surprisingly not having date manipulation functions isn't amongst it's many, many flaws. It's something I did in a past life isn't it?? The fix was easy enough- rewrite the function to actually use date handling. This made a simpler, basically one-line function, using Crystal's built in functions. That fixed this particular date handling bug, but there were plenty more places where this kind of hand-grown string munging happened, and plenty more opportunities for the report to fail.
