    "description": "This, feline fam, is a purrfect example of why we prefer cats over hoomans. We love our feline family more than life itself. Our hooman one… meh. We love them, but that doesn't mean we have to like them. But, to be fair, we never have to lend our cats money - we just have to pay for them for their entire lives. We knew that going into it. The sister in this post probably didn't know that she was going to have to lend her older, selfish sister over $2k when she was going through a tough time, only to be ghosted without a cent in return.The worst part is? The money isn't even for her - it's for their childhood cat. She needs an emergency surgery, and while the cat mom struggles to collect all the cash, her sister is partying on TikTok and actively ignoring her.

A week that's full of all the feline funnies you can wish for, until your heart is filled with all the feline fluff it can handle. What can we say? Cats are just so cute they can do that to a person.

If they'd be even a little more adorable than they are, the world won't handle it.That's why all this cat cuteness have to be  balanced with some hissterical humor. That's where cat memes come in - the dank memes energy mixed with the abundant cat wholesomeness creates the purrfect balance for internet cat comedy. Cat memes are great, funny in the exact amount for a good laugh and some warm feelings in your heart. That's why we have all these cat memes all around, so everyone who want some humor with cuteness can enjoy a good dose of funny cat memes.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver.

    "description": "Parking wars occur way more often than you think—and you're probably already assuming that they happen a lot. Both parties on either side of the argument usually think they're in the right for whatever reason, but of course, that can't really be true. Some understand that they're acting out of turn in an entitled manner, but that doesn't matter to them; they only want to get what they want, and if being a bad person is what will bring them to it, you bet they're going to take that route!Some entitled individuals, like the one in this next story, gaslight themselves so hard that they'll start to believe the lies they're telling themselves and others. The parking debacle that takes place is not only annoying to read about, but it is also surreal. In what world would a landlord tell a tenant to steal another tenant's parking spot? Not only is that insane to think about, but it's also unbelievable. The parking spot stealer believes they are the ones being harassed so hard that they try to ostracize the person who posted this story. Not going to happen.

    "description": "Grief is a hard nut to crack; there's just no two ways about it. There's no way of speeding through it or predicting what course it will take, either; when it will show up day to day or month to month, and how it will present itself. Scars don't fade quickly, and having people place demands or expectations on you during this time is sure to cause you to crumble under the pressure or lead to long-term and lasting effects.This 16-year-old girl was struggling to cope with the loss of her mother when her world was turned on its head again with the arrival of a woman who claimed to be carrying her father's baby, only 9 months after the loss of her mother. Everything was moving far too quickly, and the girl felt that this was hypocritical of her father since he had always criticized others in similar situations. The mutual bad feelings and the difficult situation presented, combined with the changing family dynamics and extremely complex emotions caused everything to boil over, prompting the girl to move out of her father's home and move in with her grandparents, something her father's new girlfriend took further offense too, especially when the father continued to try and make things work with his daughter.Who knows what prompted this and what the father's true feelings are? Maybe he made a mistake after the loss of his wife and is trying to do right by them, but this is certainly one situation with no clear-cut right answer. What is clear though is that the girl needs time to grieve and support, support that she is lucky to be able to receive from other family.",

    "description": "Nina's team has a new developer on the team. They're not a junior developer, though Nina wishes they could replace this developer with a junior. Inexperience is better than whatever this Java code is. Object[] test = (Object[]) options; List schedulePlatformList = (List)((Object[])options)[0]; List visibleTableCols = (List)((Object[])options)[1]; We start by casting options into an array of Objects. That's already a code stench, but we actually don't even use the test variable and instead just redo the cast multiple times. But worse than that, we cast to an array of object, access an element, and then cast that element to a collection type. I do not know what is in the options variable, but based on how it gets used, I don't like it. What it seems to be is a class (holding different options as fields) rendered as an array (holding different options as elements). The new developer (ab)uses this pattern everywhere.
