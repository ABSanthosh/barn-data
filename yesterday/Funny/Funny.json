Creating 100+ versions of your resume and signing up for 12 million Workday accounts, all the while knowing you won't hear back from most of your prospects. If they do reply, half of them will be an automated message where they probably misspelled your last name. How do I know? Less than a year ago, that's where I was. Gathering references from folks who can attest to your abilities is easy, but sometimes, you realize you can never truly trust them—even if they're a relative.The job seeker who posted this next story explains that he was looking for a job at a specific company and put his sister-in-law down as a reference. Little did he know, she would give him the worst non-recommendation known to man, and he'd have 100% access to it and read it. He has no idea what's going on, and to be honest, neither do I.

They maintained the pool, took care of the grills, and kept the landscaping nice, so I was happy to fork over some cash every month to keep that going. However, time went on and they grew old, ready to pass the torch to the next HOA leaders who, unfortunately, were a giant corpo property management company. Within a few months, everything had fallen into disrepair, they raised HOA dues by $300/month, and they became completely out of touch with the property. Now I know what it's like to live under the thumb of an idiocracy. The HOA Karen, in this next story started taking pictures of her neighbor doing yoga on her balcony, hoping to ban her 'Eastern religious' practices and save the family neighborhood from her standard workout garb….",

It is simply the nature of these things. And unfortunately in such situations we almost always turn to destructive behavior, and more often than not, it harms us rather than those around. Which is why we decided that you might manage to take a moment away from that maelstrom to indulge in some similarly destructive cattos to give the effect of looking in a mirror and watching your alternate self get into destructive situations, without you having to handle the consequences.So if you are ready to wash your hands of clawminal responsibility and pass it on to the felines who cannot be held accountable for their actions, then settle in and enjoy.",

You know, when you're moving in somewhere or when you're getting a new roommate, whether they have a cat or not. If you don't want it in your house, don't take the roommate. If you don't want roommate that will cause drama around your feline, ask about it, find out if and what they might have issues with. Seriously, we have seen so much drama that could have been avoided if only a few questions were asked. We have seen roommates lock cats in their rooms without permission. We have seen roommates get mad because they're allergic to cats even though they agreed to getting a roommate with a cat in the first place. We've seen roommates unexpectedly bring cats home even though the other roommates didn't know and didn't agree to it. Today's story… we don't know if this one could have been avoided. It seems like the roommates in question were either dumb or liars. Thankfully, the cat is okay. But really, ask some questions. Don't risk your cat.",

For those few (everyone) who didn't catch the off-by-one from last week's batch, there's the clue. \"Gotta CAPTCHA 'Em All,\" puns Alex G. \"So do I select them all?\" he wondered. I think the correct answer is null.   \"What does a null eat?\" wondered B.J.H , \"and is one null invited or five?\". The first question is easily answered. NaaN, of course. Probably garlic. I would expect B.J. to already know the eating habits of a long-standing companion, so I am guessing that the whole family is not meant to tag along. Stick with just the one.   Planespotter Rick R. caught this one at the airport. \"Watching my daughter's flight from New York and got surprised by Boeing's new supersonic 737 having already arrived in DFW,\" he observed. I'm not quite sure what went wrong. It's not the most obvious time zone mistake I can imagine, but I'm pretty sure the cure is the same: all times displayed in any context that is not purely restricted to a single location (and short time frame) should explicitly include the relevant timezone.   Rob H. figures \"From my day job's MECM Software Center. It appears that autocorrect has miscalculated, because the internet cannot be calculated.\" The internet is -1.   Ending this week on a note of hope, global warrior Stewart may have just saved the planet. \"Climate change is solved. We just need to replicate the 19 March performance of my new solar panels.\" Or perhaps I miscalculated.   [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.

    "description": "Barry rolled into work at 8:30AM to see the project manager waiting at the door, wringing her hands and sweating. She paced a bit while Barry badged in, and then immediately explained the issue: Today was a major release of their new features. This wasn't just a mere software change; the new release was tied to major changes to a new product line- actual widgets rolling off an assembly line right now. And those changes didn't work. \"I thought we tested this,\" Barry said. \"We did! And Stu called in sick today!\" Stu was the senior developer on the project, who had written most of the new code. \"I talked to him for a few minutes, and he's convinced it's a data issue. Something in the metadata or something?\" \"I'll take a look,\" Barry said. He skipped grabbing a coffee from the carafe and dove straight in. Prior to the recent project, the code had looked something like this: if (IsProduct1(_productId)) _programId = 1; elseif (IsProduct2(_productId)) _programId = 2; elseif (IsProduct3(_productId)) _programId = 3; Part of the project, however, was about changing the workflow for \"Product 3\". So Stu had written this code: if (IsProduct1(_productId)) _programId = 1; else if (IsProduct2(_productId)) _programId = 2; else if (IsProduct3(_productId)) _programId = 3; DoSomethingProductId3Specific1(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific2(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific3(); Since this is C# and not Python, it took Barry all of 5 seconds to spot this and figure out what the problem was and fix it: if (IsProduct1(_productId)) { _programId = 1; } else if (IsProduct2(_productId)) { _programId = 2; } else if (IsProduct3(_productId)) { _programId = 3; DoSomethingProductId3Specific1(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific2(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific3(); } This brings us to about 8:32. Now, given the problems, Barry wasn't about to just push this change- in addition to running pipeline tests (and writing tests that Stu clearly hadn't), he pinged the head of QA to get a tester on this fix ASAP. Everyone worked quickly, and that meant by 9:30 the fix was considered good and ready to be merged in and pushed to production. Sometime in there, while waiting for a pipeline to complete, Barry managed to grab a cup of coffee to wake himself up. While Barry was busy with that, Stu had decided that he wasn't feeling that sick after all, and had rolled into the office around 9:00. Which meant that just as Barry was about to push the button to run the release pipeline, an \"URGENT\" email came in from Stu. \"Hey, everybody, I fixed that bug. Can we get this released ASAP?\" Barry went ahead and released the version that he'd already tested, but out of morbid curiosity, went and checked Stu's fix. if (IsProduct1(_productId)) _programId = 1; else if (IsProduct2(_productId)) _programId = 2; else if (IsProduct3(_productId)) { _programId = 3; } if (IsProduct3(_productId)) { DoSomethingProductId3Specific1(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific2(); DoSomethingProductId3Specific3(); } At least this version would have worked, though I'm not sure Stu fully understands what \"{}\"s mean in C#. Or in most programming languages, if we're being honest. With Barry's work, the launch went off just a few minutes later than the scheduled time. Since the launch was successful, at the next company \"all hands\", the leadership team made sure to congratulate the people instrumental in making it happen: that is to say, the lead developer of the project, Stu.
