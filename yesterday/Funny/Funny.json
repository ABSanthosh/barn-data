    "description": "Bad service at a restaurant or bar is one of life's minor yet soul-crushing annoyances. You know, the kind of service where the orders take forever, drinks are left unfilled, or that awkward moment when the server doesn't even pretend to care that you've been side eyeing them for the past 20 minutes. Most of us try to cut servers some slack—after all, they're probably overworked, underpaid, and likely juggling a table full of Karens who are making their lives miserable. Even if the service is terrible, the guilt often keeps us still tipping 20% out of sheer sympathy.But not everyone can brush off bad service so easily. One guy found a hilariously petty way to get back at an inattentive server... by serving auditory chaos in the form of the worst song ever on the bar's jukebox. We're talking about a 26-minute sonic nightmare that messes with your head, infuriates the staff, and leaves everyone in the place disturbed. The best part is that he gets his revenge without ever having to say a word. Keep reading for this hilariously clever act of vengeance.",

    "link": "https://cheezburger.com/38237189/it-boss-insists-that-salaried-employee-has-to-work-during-vacation-employee-discovers-a-clever-way",
    "description": "What's the point of a vacation if you have to keep an eye on your phone the whole time? If you're anxiously awaiting a call from your boss at any minute, you're not exactly getting much time to relax and unwind. Disconnecting from work is so important, but a lot of managers view vacation time as some optional luxury. They seem to take it personally when their employees request time off, as if that employee is taking money from their pockets. Even though it's just their job to manage people, they get upset when someone needs a break because they'll have to work a bit extra. This person just wanted to take a brief vacation with their wife, and they even booked a nice trip to get away from it all. However, their boss had other plans for them. At least this employee pushed back when their boss told them that he'd need to contact them during the trip. It's infuriating when your boss calls or texts you when you're off the clock… and some managers, like this dude, think that being a salaried employee means you're available 24/7. You can't buy all of an employee's time! Next, read about the mildly infuriating things that toddlers are doing, like one parent who lamented that they \"Made bagels… my toddler took a single bite out of each one.\"",

Are our cats calmly napping by our feet the entire night? Or are our cats causing chaos all night the way that they know they are not allowed to during the day? Either option is pawssible, but really, curious as we have been, we have not had any serious reason to put up cameras and film our cats in the middle of the night. This couple definitely had a reason. When you are spending your nights having a hard time sleeping, and you think that maybe - just maybe - there is a chance that your cat is somehow at fault, then yeah, it's time to set up a camera and see what's up. And what was up here, in this couple's case, was both hilarious and adorable at the same time.",

    "description": "Phil's company hired a contractor. It was the typical overseas arrangement: bundle up a pile of work, send it off to another timezone, receive back terrible code, push back during code review, then the whole thing blows up when the contracting company pushes back about how while the code review is in the contract if you're going to be such sticklers about it, they'll never deliver, and then management steps in and says, \"Just keep the code review to style comments,\" and then it ends up not mattering anyway because the contractor assigned to the contract leaves for another contracting company, and management opts to use the remaining billable hours for a new feature instead of finishing the inflight work, so you inherit a half-finished pile of trash and somehow have to make it work. Like I said, pretty standard stuff. Phil found this construct scattered all over the codebase: if cond1 and cond2: pass elif cond1 or cond2: # do actual work I hesitate to post this, because what we're looking at is just an attempt at doing a xor operation. And it's not wrong- it's an if statement way of writing (not a and b) or (a and not b). And if we're being nit-picky, while Python has a xor operator, it's technically a bitwise xor, so I could see someone not connecting that they could use it in this case- cond1 ^ cond2 would work just fine, so long as both conditions are actual booleans. But Python often uses non-boolean comparisons, like: text = \"\" if text: print(\"This won't print.\") This is playing with truthiness, and the problem here is that you can't use a xor to chain these conditions together. if text ^ otherText: # do stuff That's a runtime error, as the ^ is only defined for integral types. You'd have to write: if bool(text) ^ bool(otherText): # do stuff So, would it have been better to use one of the logical equivalences for xor? Certainly. Would it have been even better to turn that equivalence into a function so you could actually call a xor function? Absolutely. But I also can't complain too much about this one. I hate it, don't get me wrong, but it's not a trainwreck. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.
