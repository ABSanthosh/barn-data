    "description": "Bosses will be like, \"If you don't like it, quit,\" and then act surprised when their workers throw in the towel. Like buddy, what did you expect when you put your employees under tough circumstances for low pay? They're going to walk out that door and never look back. Some workers start jobs and then realize that the conditions are unbearable. In this selection of stories, there are workers dealing with both extremes: some chefs got caught in 115-degree heat, while other workers got placed in freezers with temperatures below freezing. Human beings just don't tolerate these extreme temperatures very well, and it's not surprising that they'd flee from such a job as soon as possible. Other people realized they'd never get along with management, and instead of putting up with their manager's condescension even one more minute, they quit mid-shift. If you've ever wanted to get back at a bad boss while you're in the service industry, this is the way to do it. They'll be forced to cover your work, like helping crabby customers or working a grill in high temperatures. If only they'd been a little nicer… Next, check out some employees who made really big mistakes and lived to tell the tale, like the woman who somehow \"printed 500 copies of her gas bill on the company printer.\" Whoops!",

    "description": "Outdated workplace dynamics are unfortunately still alive and well today. We would all like to think that we have evolved from the days of bosses firing employees without justified cause, but the truth of the matter is that while some progress has been made, we haven't evolved that much yet.Here, we have a female employee in her twenties who began to notice that the other female coworkers on her team were leaving the company one by one as soon as there were big life events going on in their personal lives, such as engagements, weddings, and pregnancies. Their boss, who is a woman, seemed to be behind this trend of firing or pushing out her female employees. Once this kind of behavior becomes a pattern backed up by facts, it's pretty hard to ignore. Keep scrolling below to see what the author of this story did when she called out her boss for this upsetting trend!",

If someone hears a kitten crying for help or helps a kitten who approached them, we see that as one of the kindest things that you can pawssibly do. And that is exactly what the couple in this story did. When they saw a kitten climbing up their window, trying to find shelter during a storm, they did the only thing that they thought was right - they brought the kitten in, even started making plans to adopt the kitten. It's not their fault that the kitten turned out to be a bobcat. We suppose that in the darkness, when you're saving a kitten, you might not notice that it's a tiny bit bigger than it should be and that's its shape and its fur pattern are a little unusual. We still believe that they did the right thing when bringing the kitten in, because we're not sure how well it would have done out there in the storm if its momma was not nearby at the time, but the best thing that they did, of course, was to help the kitten reunite with its momma in the morning. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.

    "description": "Where did you GOTO on your vacation? Nowhere. GOTO is considered harmful. Original --Remy Everybody knows that you should never use \"goto\" statements. Well, except in one or two rare circumstances that you won't come across anyway. But even when you do come across those situations, they're usually \"mirage cases\" where there's no need to \"goto\" anyway. Kinda like today's example, written by Jonathan Rockway's colleague. Of course, the irony here is that the author likely tried to use \"continue\" as his label, but was forced to abbreviate it to \"cont\" in order to skirt compiler \"reserved words\" errors. while( sysmgr-\u003egetProcessCount() != 0 ) { // Yes, I realize \"goto\" statements are considered harmful, // but this is a case where it is OK to use them cont: //inactivation is not guaranteed and may take up to 3 calls sysmgr-\u003eCurrentProcess()-\u003eTryInactivate(); if( sysmgr-\u003eCurrentProcess()-\u003eIsActive() ) { Sleep(DEFAULT_TIMEOUT); goto cont; } /* ED: Snip */ //disconnect child processes if( sysmgr-\u003eCurrentProcess()-\u003eHasChildProcesses() ) { /* ED: Snip */ } /* ED: Snip */ if( sysmgr-\u003eCurrentProcess()-\u003eIsReusable() ) { sysmgr-\u003eReuseCurrentProcess(); goto cont; } sysmgr-\u003eCloseCurrentProcess(); } [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds.

    "title": "Classic WTF: The Core Launcher",
    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/classic-wtf-the-core-launcher",
    "description": "As our vacation continues, we might want to maybe play some video games. What could possibly go wrong? Original --Remy “You R haccking files on my computer~!!!” Charles Carmichael read in a newly-submitted support ticket, “this is illigle and I will sue your whoal compiny. But first I will tell every1 nevar to buy youre stupid game agin.” The bizarre spelling and vague threats were par for the course. After all, when you market and sell a game to the general public, you can expect a certain percentage of bizarre and vague customer communications. When that game is a popular MMPORG (no, not that one), that percentage tends to hover around the majority. It took a few days to see the pattern, but the string of emails started to make sense. “Uh, when did your game become spyware?” said one email. “Are you doing this just to force us to play more often?” another customer asked. “I know you have a lot of AI and whatnot, so I think it leaked out. Because now my whole computer wants me to play all the time… like my dog bringing me his chew toy.” As it turned out, the problem started happening a few days after an update to the core launcher was published. The core launcher was one of those terrifically handy executables that could download all of the assets for any single game that was published, scan them for completeness, replace bad or missing files, and then launch the game itself after the user signed in. It’s a must-have for any modern multiplayer online game. This core launcher could also patch itself. Updates to this executable were fairly rare, but had to be made whenever a new title launched, as was recently the case. Obviously, a large battery of automated and manual testing is done to ensure that there are no problems after publishing, yet something seemed to have slipped through the cracks… at least for some customers. After a whole lot of back and forth with customers, Chris was able to compile dozens of detailed process lists, startup program launches, newly installed applications, and firewall usage rules. As he pored over the collected information, one program was always there. It was Interfersoft’s fairly popular anti-virus suite. It took a solid two days of research, but Chris was finally able to uncover the new “feature” in Interfersoft’s Advanced Firewall Protector that was causing the problems. Like many similar anti-virus suites, when a program wanted to use network services, Interfersoft would pop-up a dialog confirming that the program’s operation was authorized. Behind the scenes, if the user allowed the program, Interfersoft would make a hash of that executable file, and would allow its communications to pass through the firewall every time thereafter. Users who had this antivirus solution installed had, at one time, allowed the launcher through their firewall. The first time they connected to the game server after the launcher patch was released, their executable would download its patch, apply it to itself, and restart itself. But then of course, the executable hash didn’t match any more, and the program was no longer able to go through the firewall. Rather than asking users if they wanted to allow the program to connect to the internet, in the new version of Interfersoft’s suite, the anti-virus system would rename the executable and move it. The logic being that, if it was changed after connecting to the internet, it was probably malware. But what did they name the file? Program.exe. Unless that was already taken, then they would name it Progra~1.exe or Progra~2.exe and so forth. And where did they place this file? Well, in the root directory of C of course! This naming convention, as it turned out, was a bad idea. Back in the very old, Windows 3 days, Windows did not support long file names. It wasn’t until Windows NT 3.5.1 (and then Windows 95 later) that long file names were supported. Prior to this, there were a lot of limitations on what characters could be part of a filename or directory, one of those being a space. In fact, any space in a shell command execution was seen to be an argument. This made sense at the time so you could issue a command like this: C:\\DOOM\\doom.exe -episode 3 That, of course, would start Doom at episode 3. However, when Microsoft switched to Long File Names, it still had to support this type of invocation. So, the way the windows cmd.exe shell works is simple. You pass it a string like this: C:\\Program Files\\id Software\\Doom\\Doom.exe -nomusic And it will try to execute “C:\\Program” as a file, passing it “Files\\id Software\\Doom\\Doom.exe -nomusic” as argument to that executable. Of course, this program doesn’t exist, so it will then try to execute “C:\\Program Files\\id”, passing it “Software\\Doom\\Doom.exe -nomusic” as argument. If this doesn’t exist, it will try to execute “C:\\Program Files\\id Software\\Doom\\Doom.exe” passing in “-nomusic” as an argument. It would continue this way until a program existed and started, or until the path was depleted and no program was to be found. And on top of all this, desktop shortcuts on Windows are mostly just invocations of the shell, with the actual location of the executable you want to start (the path) stored in text inside the shortcut. When you click it, it reads this path, and passes it to the shell to start up the program. And this is why Intersoft’s process of moving files to the root directory was the worst decision they could have made. Most of the programs installed in Windows at this time were installed to the “Program Files” directory by default. This was a folder in the root (C:\\) directory. So when you wanted to launch, for instance, Microsoft Word, the shortcut on your Desktop pointed to “C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Office\\Word.exe” or Firefox, which was in “C:\\Program Files\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\”. But thanks to Program.exe in the root directory, you ended up doing this: C:\\Program.exe “Files\\Microsoft\\Office\\Word.exe” and C:\\Program.exe “Files\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\” So, when users were trying to launch their application – applications which resided in the Program Files directory on their C drive – they were getting the launcher instead. Chris explained all of this in great detail to Interfersoft, all the while explaining to customers how to fix the problem with the firewall. It helped some, but several hundred customers ended up closing their accounts a direct result of the “hacking”. A few weeks later, Interfersoft started responding to the issues with their customers. Fortunately (for them), they decided to not use their own auto-update process to deliver a new version of the firewall.
