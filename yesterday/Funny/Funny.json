Either in a relationship context when you see your ex after a few months and you can simply tell they regret breaking up with you, or it can be in the workplace context–when you prove to a past employer how wrong they were when they decided to fire you or push you away.Getting fired or broken up with is someone no one wants to experience, but if you do, you have to make the best out of it and make them truly regret that decision. The story down below is the perfect example of that.The employee who wrote this story was unexpectedly let go from their job, with little to no explanation from their employer. As they were leaving, they were told they were 'easily replaceable', which gave way to the perfect and satisfying opportunity to show the employer what they will lose by letting them go, even if it was unintentional.",

    "description": "There are some rules in workplaces that are okay to bend. For instance, so you accidentally take home a pack of pens that were meant for the office. Whatever. It happens. You take a longer a little bit of a longer lunch than you're supposed. That's okay, sometimes you just need that. However, some rules are there for a reason and should not be broken. These rules usually have to do with health and safety. For example, when you are working at a plant that deals with very toxic and deadly chemicals, you are very much not going to want to break the rules that are put in place to keep you healthy and safe there.  So why is it that many companies will try and take the cheapest route they can when it comes to keeping things up to code? They want to hire a top-notch health and safety manager, but then once they get called out for all the unsafe and unhealthy things happening in the company that needs to be changed, they all of a sudden regret getting such a professional health and safety manager. That is exactly what happened to this Redditor. And after he took the necessary break he was entitled to after suffering a heart attack, he came back to a bleak surprise.",

    "description": "The new year has settled in, 2025 is already comfortable and cozy, but it means that last month Christmas was over and done. Christmas brings a time of happiness and joy, dotted with gifts, and these gifts sometimes happen to be animals. Now, we're not particularly against gifting a precious little pet to someone on a happy time such as Christmas, but we definitely do not endorse getting rid of such a gift as if it were any other toy or piece of clothing that doesn't fit. That is just plain cruelty, no matter how tough it suddenly became for a person to become a pawrent.Last month a humble hooman witnessed with his own eyes a kindle of kittens being thrown to the side of the road from a passing car. Maybe they were a \"discarded Christmas gift\"? It won't surprise us if this is the case, but our hooman hero of the story didn't have an opportunity to find out, since the car the kittens were thrown out of drove away fast. But this hearty hooman couldn't stay indifferent and took this litter in, found furever homes to all of them but one - who he now shares his home with.When his sassy kitten, Banks, grew up a little, his hooman turned to the online feline family to inquire about his potential breed - but we all know the online feline family, they did not stay indifferent to this touching rescue story. The reactions expressed everything from sadness about the initially intended fate of the cute kittens, through anger about the person who decided to throw them at the side of the road, to the wholesome gratitude for this hearty hooman who saved Banks and his kitten siblings. Oh, and also some funny reactions about the sassy pictures of the kitten… Scroll down to melt your feline-infatuated heart!",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/crossly-joined",
    "description": "Antonio's team hired some very expensive contractors and consultants to help them build a Java based application. These contractors were very demure, very mindful, about how using ORMs could kill performance. So they implemented a tool that would let them know any time the Hibernate query generator attempted to perform a cross join. public class DB2390Dialect extends org.hibernate.dialect.DB2390Dialect { private Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(DB2390Dialect.class); @Override public String getCrossJoinSeparator() { try { Exception e = new Exception(); throw e; } catch (Exception xe) { logger.warn(\"cross join \", xe.getMessage()); } return \", \"; } } I'm going to call this one a near miss. I understand what they were trying to do. Hibernate uses a set of \"dialect\"s to convert logical operations in a query to literal syntax- as you can see here, this function turns a cross join operation into a \", \". What they wanted to do was detect where in the code this happened and log a message. They wanted the message to contain a stack trace, and that's why they threw an exception. Unfortunately, they logged, not the stack trace, but the message- a message which they're not actually setting. Thus, the logger would only ever log \"cross join \", but with no information to track down when or why it happened. That said, the standard way in Java of getting the stack trace skips the exception throwing: StackTraceElement[] st = new Throwable().getStackTrace(). Of course, that would have made them do some actual logging logic, and not just \"I dunno, drop the message in the output?\" The only remaining question is how much did this feature cost? Since these were \"expert consultants\", we can ballpark it as somewhere between \"a few thousand dollars\" to \"many thousands of dollars\"..

    "description": "Bejamin's team needed to generate a unique session ID value that can't easily be guessed. The traditional way of doing this would be to generate cryptographically secure random bytes. Most languages, including PHP, have a solution for doing that. But you could also do this: protected function _createId() { $id = 0; while (strlen($id) \u003c 32) { $id .= mt_rand(0, mt_getrandmax()); } $id = md5(uniqid($id, true)); return $id; } Now, mt_rand is not cryptographically secure. They generate a random number (of arbitrary size) and concatenate it to a string. When the string is 32 characters long (including a leading zero), we call that enough. This is not generating random bytes. To the contrary, the bytes it's generating are very not random, seeing as they're constrained to a character between 0 and 9. We then pass that through the uniqid function. Now, uniqid also generates a non-cryptographically secure unique identifier. Here, we're specifying our large number is the prefix to that unique ID, and asking for more randomness to be added (the true parameter). This is better than what they did with the while loop above, though still not the \"correct\" way to do it. Finally, we pass it through the md5 algorithm to reduce it to a hash, because we just love hash collisions. It's impressive that, given a chance to make a choice about security-related features, they were able to make every single wrong choice. This is also why you don't implement this stuff yourself. There are far more ways to get it wrong than there are ways to get it right.
