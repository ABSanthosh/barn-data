    "description": "If bug cats are not our friends, then why are they friend shaped? It's a question we wish we could answer, but we don't know how. Like many of you, cat lovers and feline fanatic fans, we consider big cats just cats, despite their size. We want to cuddle them like cats, play with them like cats, pet them like cats, and tell them they're the cutest angel we've ever seen like cats. Is this really too much to ask? We feel like nature is being unfair here. We honestly want to give love to all cats, and that includes big cats. We don't care about their teeth and claw size, they are still tiny little babies who need a scratch under their chins.And if you doubt that premise for one second, let us assure you we come with receipts. And you already know what kind of receipts we provide here around Cheezburger, in any topic - memes, and loads of them. So here we bring you the proof with big cat memes that have the same cat energy all cats have.",

    "description": "People who have never had cats in their lives have all kinds of misconceptions about them. People think that cats are aloof or that cats are mean, but that's not true. The vast majority of cats are neither of these things, and of the cats that do seem aloof or mean… there is usually a reason. If you treat a cat well, if you give them the love and respect and time that they need, usually, even the \"meanest\" cat will open up to you and show you affection. Today's story just reinforces this notion. A demon cat - that's what this poor little thing was called throughout his life. He was mean to everyone except for his owner and her husband. But once the owner passed and the cat was adopted by her sister, his real colors started to show. In that house, he was neglected sad, so he was \"mean\" to people. In his new house, he got the things that he truly needed, and just like that, he became the sweetest cuddle-bug .",

    "description": "Everyone knows that when a new resident moves into the neighborhood, you should expect a few weeks of noise and a lot of disturbance. Not because those new neighbors are necessarily noisy people, but because new neighbors love to make repairs on their new house. They want to repaint the roof, break down some doors, rebuild the back yard, and perform a variety of other construction jobs that usually bring noise along with them. And as you watch them to move in and bring all their belonging with them, while construction workers get settled in their new site for the next few weeks, you start to consider booking a hotel room until they are done.If you think this is starting off on a bad note, if those neighbors are already acting entitled and are being mean to you, the situation can only get worse from there. They can get much more annoying if they wish to, so you should be careful with how you interact with them, or you might seriously regret it.",

    "description": "For testing networking systems, load simulators are useful: send a bunch of realistic looking traffic and see what happens as you increase the amount of sent traffic. These sorts of simulators often rely on being heavily multithreaded, since one computer can, if pushed, generate a lot of network traffic. Thus, when Jonas inherited a heavily multithreaded system for simulating load, that wasn't a surprise. The surprise was that the developer responsible for it didn't really understand threading in Java. Probably in other languages too, but in this case, Java was what they were using. public void startTraffic() { Configuration.instance.inititiateStatistics(); Statistics.instance.addStatisticListener(gui); if (t != null) { if (t.isAlive()) { t.destroy(); } } t = new Thread(this); t.start(); } Look, this is not a good way to manage threads in Java. I don't know if I'd call it a WTF, but it's very much a \"baby's first threading\" approach. There are better abstractions around threads that would avoid the need to manage thread instances directly. I certainly don't love situations where a Runnable also manages its own thread instance. This is almost certainly a race condition, but I don't know if this function is called from multiple threads (but I suspect it might be). But what's more interesting is where this code gets called. You see, starting a thread could trigger an exception, so you need to handle that: public void run() { while (true) { try { loaderMain.startTraffic(); break; } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(\"Exception in main loader thread!\"); e.printStackTrace(); } } } Inside of an infinite loop, we try to start traffic. If we succeed, we break out of the loop. If we fail, well, we try and try again and again and again and again and again and again… Jonas writes: Since I'm the only one that dares to wade through the opaque mess of code that somehow, against all odds, manages to work most of the time, I get to fix it whenever it presents strange behavior. I suspect it's going to present much more strange behavior in the future. [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds. Learn more.",
