    "description": "You know what they say: \"The early bird gets the worm.\" But in this case, being early to work backfired on this lawyer. It's a tough job market out there, and you can lose a job for a number of reasons – layoffs, poor performance, absences and tardiness, and apparently, being early? In this instance, we have a lawyer who'd start work in the wee hours of the morning in order to finish at a decent hour and spend time with his wife and kid. He'd come in around 6:00 a.m. and finish his day at 5:00 p.m. The other lawyers would put in the same amount of hours but just at a later timeframe, starting around 8:00 a.m., going to the pub together at 5:00 p.m., and then working until 9:00 p.m. Despite consistently being the first one in the firm each day, the early bird was let go because, to his bosses, it looked like he was slacking. Among many red flags in the workplace, not valuing an employee's time and hard work is one of them. Is time even real, anyway? We live on a floating rock floating through space. How dare a man want to get out of work a little early to spend time with his wife and kid…",

    "description": "There is always a big transition when a smaller company gets bought by a larger one, and that transition takes time and patience. However, sometimes, the way in which the workplace used to be run was better for everyone involved, so when some fancy guy in a suit comes in and starts implementing annoying changes, it's inevitable that those changes will be met with some resistance.In this instance, we have an employee who now has to clock out every time he takes a break. However, according to the new system, he discovered that efvery break is clocked at 30 minutes no matter how long the break actually is. This meant that the employee was able to take breaks lasting one or two hours while complying with the new policy. Talk about a perfect situation! The best part is that if he were confronted with probing questions, he can say that he literally was just following HR's orders like any other loyal and compliant employee!",

Recently, it was Father's Day, and we sent a sarcastic, yet silly, note in our family group chat accusing everyone of not wishing us a happy Father's Day. Our parents responded with, \"But you're not a father!\", to which we said, \"How dare you! Mr. Whiskers is our child!\" We weren't really upset that nobody wished us a happy Father's Day (even Mr. Whiskers), but the sentiment remains true: he is our literal cat child.And he's way more purrfect than any of your hooman children, anyway. He's clean, only cries when he's hungry or we haven't paid enough attention to him, and we haven't once had to change his diaper (he doesn't even have a diaper). So, if you're like us and you treat your cats like your fur babies, welcome. This is a safe space for you. And better yet, we've got a bunch of cat memes that just make sense for us pawrents.

    "description": "Anybody out there who thinks that being a momma cat is easy because cats are \"independent\" is wrong. Being a cat momma is hard work. Because before your kittens get all independent… well, they need to be taught how to be independent. Kittens need to learn how to drink water from a bowl without getting it all up in their noses. Kittens need to learn how to communicate properly - so that they know exactly how to demand everything that they need from their human servants. Being a cat mom to one kitten is enough work. Hard work. But most momma cats don't give birth to just one kitten. It's usually around four kittens per litter, maybe six, depending on the breed of the cat. Eight is the most that we have heard of before. And yet, this momma cat has broken the record. The human who had rescued her thought that, after hours and hours of delivery, seven was going to be the end of it, but the next morning… they got a couple more surprises. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.

Without debating the merits of loads of getters and setters versus bare properties, ideally, getters and setters are the easiest code to write. Many IDEs will just generate them for you! How can you screw up getters and setters? Well, Dave found someone who could. private ReportDatesDao reportDatesDao; @Resource(name = CensusDao.BEAN_NAME) public void setAuditDao(CensusDao censusDao) { this.reportDatesDao = reportDatesDao; } The function is called setAuditDao, takes a CensusDao input, but manipulates reportDatesDao, because clearly someone copy/pasted and didn't think about what they were doing. The result, however, is that this just sets this.reportDatesDao equal to itself. I'm always impressed by code which given the chance to make multiple decisions makes every wrong choice, even if it is just lazy copy/paste.
