There's a certain appreciation and care one should have entering a place where the items were handcrafted and made with love. But unfortunately, we live in a world where some people don't understand this in the slightest and will go to strange lengths to get what they want.If you've ever worked in retail or the service, you've definitely had the pleasure of handling unhappy customers who throw the most ridiculous requests at you. It's as if they see you wearing a uniform and suddenly their respect and social cues go out the window. This brave shopkeeper in particular had to handle the worst of the worst – an Instagram micro-influencer. Apparently, having more than a thousand followers on Instagram can inflate a person's ego like a balloon, as this boutique employee saw.",

When you get along with the person who lives closest to you, it is like all of the planets have aligned and you can live in peace now. It's just nice knowing you have someone near by who will have your back and be able to get to you the quickest during an emergency. That's what a community is for!  The only problem, it would seem, is that finding a good neighbor isn't the easiest task in the world. There are countless posts of people ranting about the nightmare that lives next to them. Entitled neighbors who think the world revolves around them and you only moved in next door to do their bidding. It's atrocious. Luckily, some of these Karen neighbors get put in their place—like this male Karen who loved to pretend a shared lot between him and his neighbors was his dumping ground.",

Recently, it was Father's Day, and we sent a sarcastic, yet silly, note in our family group chat accusing everyone of not wishing us a happy Father's Day. Our parents responded with, \"But you're not a father!\", to which we said, \"How dare you! Mr. Whiskers is our child!\" We weren't really upset that nobody wished us a happy Father's Day (even Mr. Whiskers), but the sentiment remains true: he is our literal cat child.And he's way more purrfect than any of your hooman children, anyway. He's clean, only cries when he's hungry or we haven't paid enough attention to him, and we haven't once had to change his diaper (he doesn't even have a diaper). So, if you're like us and you treat your cats like your fur babies, welcome. This is a safe space for you. And better yet, we've got a bunch of cat memes that just make sense for us pawrents.

    "description": "Anybody out there who thinks that being a momma cat is easy because cats are \"independent\" is wrong. Being a cat momma is hard work. Because before your kittens get all independent… well, they need to be taught how to be independent. Kittens need to learn how to drink water from a bowl without getting it all up in their noses. Kittens need to learn how to communicate properly - so that they know exactly how to demand everything that they need from their human servants. Being a cat mom to one kitten is enough work. Hard work. But most momma cats don't give birth to just one kitten. It's usually around four kittens per litter, maybe six, depending on the breed of the cat. Eight is the most that we have heard of before. And yet, this momma cat has broken the record. The human who had rescued her thought that, after hours and hours of delivery, seven was going to be the end of it, but the next morning… they got a couple more surprises. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.

    "description": "If you write a lot of Java, you're going to end up writing a lot of getters and setters. Without debating the merits of loads of getters and setters versus bare properties, ideally, getters and setters are the easiest code to write. Many IDEs will just generate them for you! How can you screw up getters and setters? Well, Dave found someone who could. private ReportDatesDao reportDatesDao; @Resource(name = CensusDao.BEAN_NAME) public void setAuditDao(CensusDao censusDao) { this.reportDatesDao = reportDatesDao; } The function is called setAuditDao, takes a CensusDao input, but manipulates reportDatesDao, because clearly someone copy/pasted and didn't think about what they were doing. The result, however, is that this just sets this.reportDatesDao equal to itself. I'm always impressed by code which given the chance to make multiple decisions makes every wrong choice, even if it is just lazy copy/paste.

Yes, it's hard coded, but these values won't ever change anyway. Stop being so #### about it. $Subnets = @(\"0.0.0.0\",\"128.0.0.0\",\"192.0.0.0\",\"224.0.0.0\",\"240.0.0.0\",\"248.0.0.0\",\"252.0.0.0\",\"254.0.0.0\",\"255.0.0.0\",\"255.128.0.0\",\"255.192.0.0\",\"255.224.0.0\",\"255.240.0.0\",\"255.248.0.0\",\"255.252.0.0\",\"255.254.0.0\",\"255.255.0.0\",\"255.255.128.0\",\"255.255.192.0\",\"255.255.224.0\",\"255.255.240.0\",\"255.255.248.0\",\"255.255.252.0\",\"255.255.254.0\",\"255.255.255.0\",\"255.255.255.128\",\"255.255.255.192\",\"255.255.255.224\",\"255.255.255.240\",\"255.255.255.248\",\"255.255.255.252\",\"255.255.255.254\",\"255.255.255.255\") I believe them when they say that the lookup array is faster, but it leaves me wondering: what are they doing where performance matters that much? I don't actually think this ascends to the level of a WTF, but I do think the defensive comment is funny. Clearly, the original developer was having a time with people complaining about it. Frank notes that while Perl has a reputation as a \"write only language,\" this particular set of scripts was actually quite easy to read and maintain.
