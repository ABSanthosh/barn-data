At the restaurant, the customer is king, and oftentimes, they let the weight of that crown get to them, becoming the most insufferable version of themselves just in time for dinner. This server in our next story reports a tale so classic and so relatable that waiters and waitresses everywhere cringe with second-hand embarrassment, while revelling in the tiny victories from behind the counter. Deals make Karens turn feral. Catching up on their coupons, disparaging a minimum wage worker for a managerial special, or bothering a service industry employee until they get something for free is a Karen's favorite hobby, giving them feelings of power in a soul-sucking way. The woman in this next story thought she was being clever when she cornered her server into analyzing the menu, pointing out tedious details for add-ons in an attempt to cheat the pricing, but despite her lack of mathematical skills, she never once realized she was even saving $2—but not before wasting everyone's time at the table.",

But if you're clever and a bit salty, you can pull away the veil of their little plans, foiling their clout-farming attempts in an instant. This restaurant owner's kid in this next story had seen their fair share of 'fine dining' enthusiasts attempting to impress their friends, but they'd had enough of the BS by the time the entitled customers in this next story rolled into the shop. Perhaps it was the smell of truffle oil turning sour in her nose or the sound of another over-priced champagne bottle being popped, but this dinner turned into an expensive ordeal when these customers realized they wouldn't be getting the 'friends and family' discount.",

    "description": "If bug cats are not our friends, then why are they friend shaped? It's a question we wish we could answer, but we don't know how. Like many of you, cat lovers and feline fanatic fans, we consider big cats just cats, despite their size. We want to cuddle them like cats, play with them like cats, pet them like cats, and tell them they're the cutest angel we've ever seen like cats. Is this really too much to ask? We feel like nature is being unfair here. We honestly want to give love to all cats, and that includes big cats. We don't care about their teeth and claw size, they are still tiny little babies who need a scratch under their chins.And if you doubt that premise for one second, let us assure you we come with receipts. And you already know what kind of receipts we provide here around Cheezburger, in any topic - memes, and loads of them. So here we bring you the proof with big cat memes that have the same cat energy all cats have.",

    "description": "People who have never had cats in their lives have all kinds of misconceptions about them. People think that cats are aloof or that cats are mean, but that's not true. The vast majority of cats are neither of these things, and of the cats that do seem aloof or mean… there is usually a reason. If you treat a cat well, if you give them the love and respect and time that they need, usually, even the \"meanest\" cat will open up to you and show you affection. Today's story just reinforces this notion. A demon cat - that's what this poor little thing was called throughout his life. He was mean to everyone except for his owner and her husband. But once the owner passed and the cat was adopted by her sister, his real colors started to show. In that house, he was neglected sad, so he was \"mean\" to people. In his new house, he got the things that he truly needed, and just like that, he became the sweetest cuddle-bug .",

    "description": "Sebastian is now maintaining a huge framework which, in his words, \"could easily be reduced in size by 50%\", especially because many of the methods in it are reinvented wheels that are already provided by .NET and specifically LINQ. For example, if you want the first item in a collection, LINQ lets you call First() or FirstOrDefault() on any collection. The latter option makes handling empty collections easier. But someone decided to reinvent that wheel, and like so many reinvented wheels, it's worse. public static LoggingRule FindFirst (this IEnumerable rules, Funcbool\u003e predicate) { foreach (LoggingRule rule in rules) { return rule; } return null; } This function takes a list of logging rules and a function to filter the logging rules, starts a for loop to iterate over the list, and then simply returns the first element in the list, thus exiting the for loop. If the loop doesn't contain any elements, we return null. From the signature, I'd expect this function to do filtering, but it clearly doesn't. It just returns the first element, period. And again, there's already a built-in function for that. I don't know why this is exists, but I especially dislike that it's so misleading. There's only one positive to say about this: if you did want to reduce the size of the framework by 50%, it's easy to see where I'd start.

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/the-wrong-kind-of-character",
    "description": "Today's code, at first, just looks like using literals instead of constants. Austin sends us this C#, from an older Windows Forms application: if (e.KeyChar == (char)4) { // is it a ^D? e.Handled = true; DoStuff(); } else if (e.KeyChar == (char)7) { // is it a ^g? e.Handled = true; DoOtherStuff(); } else if (e.KeyChar == (char)Keys.Home) { e.Handled = true; SpecialGoToStart(); } else if (e.KeyChar == (char)Keys.End) { e.Handled = true; SpecialGoToEnd(); } Austin discovered this code when looking for a bug where some keyboard shortcuts didn't work. He made some incorrect assumptions about the code- first, that they were checking for a KeyDown or KeyUp event, a pretty normal way to check for keyboard shortcuts. Under that assumption, a developer would compare the KeyEventArgs.KeyCode property against an enum- something like e.KeyCode == Keys.D \u0026\u0026 Keys.Control, for a CTRL+D. That's clearly not what's happening here. No, here, they used the KeyPressEvent, which is meant to represent the act of typing. That gives you a KeyPressEventArgs with a KeyChar property- because again, it's meant to represent typing text not keyboard shortcuts. They used the wrong event type, as it won't tell them about modifier keys in use, or gracefully handle the home or end keys. KeyChar is the ASCII character code of the key press: which, in this case, CTRL+D is the \"end of transmit\" character in ASCII (4), and CTRL+G is the goddamn bell character (7). So those two branches work. But home and end don't have ASCII code points. They're not characters that show up in text. They get key codes, which represent the physical key pressed, not the character of text. So (char)Keys.Home isn't really a meaningful operation. But the enum is still a numeric value, so you can still turn it into a character- it just turns into a character that emphatically isn't the home key. It's the \"$\". And Keys.End turns into a \"#\". It wasn't very much work for Austin to move the event handler to the correct event type, and switch to using KeyCodes, which were both more correct and more readable.
