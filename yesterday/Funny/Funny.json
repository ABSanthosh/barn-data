    "description": "Most of us would be thrilled to relinquish the burden of hosting, but after 10 years of making family parties her entire personality, this older sister wouldn't let go. Competitive sisterly relationships are hard to avoid. Constantly at odds and growing up pitted against one another, it's tough not to get stuck in the endless loop of the comparison game. Oftentimes, sisters will find that one thing that becomes 'their thing' in an attempt to set themselves apart from their sibling, but this 45-year-old woman, and the eldest of 2 daughters, would realize that she'd taken things too far for over a decade. Family holidays always get a little bit dicey for one reason or another. As adults, we've all gone our separate ways and lived our own lives according to our prerogative, but when we're back with family, it feels like we're 8 years old again. Perhaps that's why the grown woman in this next tale started acting like a childish baby when her sister suggested the unthinkable: Sharing holiday hosting responsibility.",

    "description": "When you're staying with friends or family it's not like you're staying at a hotel, sure there's a certain amount of hospitality that you might receive, especially if you're visiting as a one off thing, but that doesn't mean your friends have a dedicated housekeeping service and any mess you leave around the place they're going to end up cleaning themselves. Even in hotels, which have housekeeping services, you still need to be considerate and not leave a mess just because you're too inconsiderate and lazy to clean up after yourself.Further, while it's great to \"live cheap\" and \"be frugal,\" it doesn't count if you're just taking advantage of other people's goodwill and leeching off of them in order to keep your own costs down. We've all had that friend or roommate who insists that they have no spending money ever and let you pay for them for things or help themself to your food and drinks. Then one day you come to find that they actually have a sizable amount of savings and have just somehow rationalized that putting all their money in their Savings account and none of it in their Checking account somehow entitles them to leech off of others.",

    "description": "Every cat deserves a chance. That is something that we stand by here at ICHC. And that very much includes cats and big cats whose lives have gone… a little differently than others. Not everyone gets lucky in life. Some big cats face some difficulties right away, but that doesn't mean that they don't deserve to live as good a life as they can live. And that is where we step in - to try to give them that life. Thankfully, there really are some incredibly good people out there. We have seen so many instances of people helping big cats in need. Like this injured bobcat who became the best foster momma to a whole bunch of other kittens thanks to the humans who adopted it. Or this this rescued black panther who became best friends with a Rottweiler that his humans paired him up with. Or this injured bobcat who couldn't be released into the wild who found out that fennel is the best toy ever and got an endless amount of it from the humans taking care of him. They all deserved a chance, and they all got it. The same way that today bobcat, Benji, did. It's always fun to see an oldie but goodie story get some renewed traction online, and we can see why this one hit again. It's incredibly wholesome.",

We would, but we're already maxed out at six. One of the most crucial parts of staying healthy is a balanced diet with lots of fiber. And what, dear readers, is one of the best sources of fiber there is? Beans! Yes, the magical fruit (that isn't actually a fruit at all, but does, in fact, make you toot). Now, it wouldn't be I Can Has Cheezburger if we didn't add a feline twist to this recommendation, so we've got an extra serving of beans from some purrfect paws of polydactyl cats.As if cats' paws couldn't get any cuter, here you go. Not only are they fluffy, soft, and adorable, but now they come with extra beans and more floof to boot? We're sold. If this is all it takes to stay healthy, consider us the next Jane Fonda. We hope you enjoy these kitty cuties, and stay fibrous!",

    "description": "When Steve's employer went hunting for a new customer relationship management system (CRM), they had some requirements. A lot of them were around the kind of vendor support they'd get. Their sales team weren't the most technical people, and the company wanted to push as much routine support off to the vendor as possible. But they also needed a system that was extensible. Steve's company had many custom workflows they wanted to be able to execute, and automated marketing messages they wanted to construct, and so wanted a CRM that had an easy to use API. \"No worries,\" the vendor sales rep said, \"we've had a RESTful API in our system for years. It's well tested and reliable. It's JSON based.\" The purchasing department ground their way through the purchase order and eventually they started migrating to the new CRM system. And it fell to Steve to start learning the JSON-based, RESTful API. \"JSON\"-based was a more accurate description. For example, an API endpoint might have a schema like: DeliveryId: int // the ID of the created delivery Errors: xml // Collection of errors encountered This example schema is representative. Many \"JSON\" documents contained strings of XML inside of them. Often, this is done when an existing XML-based API is \"modernized\", but in this case, the root cause is a little dumber than that. The system uses SQL Server as its back end, and XML is one of the native types. They just have a stored procedure build an XML object and then return it as an output parameter. You'll be surprised to learn that the vendor's support team had a similar level of care: they officially did what you asked, but sometimes it felt like malicious compliance.

    "description": "A common class of bad code is the code which mixes server side code with client side code. This kind of thing: \u003cspan class=\"hljs-meta\"\u003e\u003c?php\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"hljs-keyword\"\u003eif\u003c/span\u003e (someVal) { \u003cspan class=\"hljs-meta\"\u003e?\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"hljs-keyword\"\u003evar\u003c/span\u003e foo = \u003cspan class=\"hljs-meta\"\u003e\u003c?\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"hljs-keyword\"\u003eecho\u003c/span\u003e someOtherVal \u003cspan class=\"hljs-meta\"\u003e?\u003e\u003c/span\u003e; \u003cspan class=\"hljs-meta\"\u003e\u003c?php\u003c/span\u003e } \u003cspan class=\"hljs-keyword\"\u003eelse\u003c/span\u003e { \u003cspan class=\"hljs-meta\"\u003e?\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"hljs-keyword\"\u003evar\u003c/span\u003e foo = \u003cspan class=\"hljs-number\"\u003e5\u003c/span\u003e; \u003cspan class=\"hljs-meta\"\u003e\u003c?php\u003c/span\u003e } \u003cspan class=\"hljs-meta\"\u003e?\u003e\u003c/span\u003e We've seen it, we hate it, and is there really anything new to say about it? Well, today's anonymous submitter found an \"interesting\" take on the pattern. \u003cspan class=\"hljs-keyword\"\u003eif\u003c/span\u003e(linkfromwhere_srfid==\u003cspan class=\"hljs-string\"\u003e'vff'\u003c/span\u003e) { \u003cspan class=\"hljs-meta\"\u003e\u003c?php\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class=\"hljs-variable\"\u003e$vff\u003c/span\u003e = \u003cspan class=\"hljs-number\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e; \u003cspan class=\"hljs-meta\"\u003e?\u003e\u003c/span\u003e } Here, they have a client-side conditional, and based on that conditional, they attempt to set a variable on the server side. This does not work. This cannot work: the PHP code executes on the server, the client code executes on the client, and you need to be a lot more thoughtful about how they interact than this. And yet, the developer responsible has done this all over the code base, pushed the non-working code out to production, and when it doesn't work, just adds bug tickets to the backlog to eventually figure out why- tickets that never get picked up, because there's always something with a higher priority out there.
