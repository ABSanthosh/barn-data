  "description": "When you're a cat pawrent, you always want to have the best for your fluffy feline friend. Sometimes, the best for your feline friend mean the best apparel you can get them. And when you're a cat parent to a distinguished gentlecat, wearing a black and white tuxedo fur for all times, you might want to have an expurrt opinion about a splendid splash of color you'd want to add to them. Matching a color to your tuxie might be a more challenging mission than you would've thought.A tuxie pawrent turned to the wisdom of the meowsses and asked - what collar color fits your black and white kitty the best? Other tuxedo cat pawrents shared their expurrt opinions to help a fellow feline pawrent in need. Some of them said bright colors should do the trick and complement their monochrome fur, but some suggested a black bow tie to complete the tuxedo look. Some even went above and beyond and recommended not just a collar - but a handkerchief, a bandana, and even a princess dress!",
