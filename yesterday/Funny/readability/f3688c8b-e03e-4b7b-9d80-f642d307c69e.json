  "description": "This dude's chaotic brother and girlfriend are pure trouble. After getting evicted from their apartment, the older brother was generous enough to allow them to crash at his place while they were taking the time they needed to rebound and get back on their feet. The catch was that the older brother had house rules. Nothing over-the-top, but he needed the place to remain orderly and stable for the sake of his 6-year-old son. Unfortunately, this backfired quickly as the younger brother and his girlfriend were simply unable to follow said house rules after about a month. At that point, the older brother was likely already wondering when they were planning on moving out, so when they started to bend his rules, he had plenty of cause to kick them out. However, the straw that really broke the camel's back had to do with the 6-year-old's mother when she came one weekend to drop her son off at the apartment. The drama that ensued led to even more family conflict!",
