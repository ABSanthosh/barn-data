  "description": "What's cooking, good looking? As the kids say these days, we're cooking over here, and have we brewed up a silly serving of cat comedy in the most purrfectly delectable of fashions. And by that, we of course mean memes. We sat down today and pawsitively pondered on this one thought: How can we make you all laugh your tails off today? It's Wednesday, meaning that you're in the middle of your mid-week slump and need some funny feline energy to get you back on your toe beans and finish off the week with a smile on your face.So, we sat, and we cooked, and cooked, and cooked, until we came up with this hissterical list of feline funnies that we just couldn't resist sharing. What's the point of spending so much time cooking if you're not going to eat and share it with others? So get ready to dig in because this feline feast of memes isn't going to consume itself. Have a great rest of your week!",

  "text": "Our cats do much worse than stare at us if we're late for dinner. They will come up and start attacking our feet (playfully, of course), and if that doesn't work, the screaming starts. You don't want to get to the screaming. It doesn't end until you put food in their bowls. No joke, we once had a rat problem in our apartment when we were younger. We called the landlord, and what was his solution? To lend us his cat for a week. But, the cat was so fat that it didn't do anything about the rats and we just got to have a chonky cat. We moved out after that.",
