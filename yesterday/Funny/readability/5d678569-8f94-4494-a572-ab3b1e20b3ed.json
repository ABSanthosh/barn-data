  "text": "Published: February 6, 2025 WASHINGTON—Rebuking President Trump’s decision to pardon Jan. 6 rioters, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) staunchly vowed this week to continue falling down stairs in the face of an apparent fascist takeover. “I can no longer physically stand upright for a party that excuses a violent insurrection that targeted our Capitol,” the 82-year-old lawmaker said as he slid down a row of steps outside the Senate chamber. “There are certain principles I refuse to compromise on, and I will make that known by tumbling down flight after flight of these hallowed steps.
