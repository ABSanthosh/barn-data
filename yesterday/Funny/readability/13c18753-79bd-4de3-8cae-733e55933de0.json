  "description": "It only cost one tree for this man to destroy his entire online presence—personal and professionally. What happened you ask? It started with some damages caused by Hurricane Milton. As it tends to happen, many homes incurred damages after this hurricane—especially homes in the line of its destruction. Some worse than others. But, hey, that's what insurance is for, right? So, when a tree fell on a man's swimming pool enclosure, he immediately turned to his insurance—and the insurance of his neighbor's since the tree was from their yard. To work they went! When it comes to property destroyed by a tree, you call an arborist, of course! These professionals specialize in anything to do with trees. So, for the removal of this tree on his and his neighbor's property, his neighbor called an arborist in. They were assured this man was a professional and took insurance, but it turns out they needed to do a little more research…",

However, after the hurricane, the wifi went out and it had not returned yet. So the people hiring this man weren't really able to do a thorough background check on him. The neighbor is familiar was chainsaws and trees and told him he had to start in his yard, however, he wanted to check with his insurance company that he was covered. The arborist was impatient and decided to start in the other neighbor's yard first instead. What happened? Yep! The tree fell into his yard destroying his property. In fact, it caused over $300k in damages! The neighbor who was rightfully upset demanded this “arborist's” insurance information and everything else. Instead, he got ghosted. So what did this man do? Well, 21st century problems call for 21st century solutions! So he not only purchased this man's professional site name, but also his personal name, his parents' names, and anything else that had to do with him. If anyone Googled this man or his business, it would go to this site and explain who this man is a fraud. It worked so well, it's the #1 site on Search. If you're gonna mess with the tree, you're gonna get the bark—or whatever that saying is…",
