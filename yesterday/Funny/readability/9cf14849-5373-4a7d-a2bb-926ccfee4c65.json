  "description": "Look, I get it, and I know if you're here reading this, you do too. Cats are the best. Whether it's the majestic fluffball living with you (or, let's be honest, the one you pay rent to) or a sassy stray you spotted crossing the street, cats are universal emotional support creatures. Yes, all of them. All the time. Even when a stray ignores me like I'm invisible, the snub feels oddly validating and injects a little serotonin into my day.  That being said, my cat, whom I physically gave birth to and have definitely shared more meaningful moments with than most humans, is mine. That's not negotiable. Now, imagine someone walking up to your door, skipping the small talk, and asking for your cat on the grounds that their kid needs it more than you do. That's exactly what this neighbor did.",

And when refused, he took offense at being denied, accusing the cat's owner of entitlement. It's a special kind of ridiculous to not only make such a request but then to act offended when it’s met with laughter and a firm no. Cats aren’t items to be borrowed or traded for the greater good. They’re family, and you don’t give up family to someone who seems to think Meow means Mine.",
