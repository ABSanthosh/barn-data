  "description": "Lateness is something that should be tolerated within reason. Sometimes, public transit is to blame. Other times, there are family emergencies. Your coworkers and employees deserve a little bit of grace under these circumstances. Even if they saunter in ten minutes late with an iced coffee in their hands, that does not give you the right to make assumptions about their priorities or shame them for wanting some caffeine to be properly alert during the work day.However, there are instances in which some coworkers and employees take that grace period a little too far. Keep scrolling below for this tale of a terrible coworker who frequently came into work 3 hours late every Friday because she was getting her nails done.",

  "text": "The thing about long acrylic nails, regardless of how you feel about them aesthetically, is that there are certain tasks that become difficult to complete depending on the job. In this case, this closing store manager was able to get some much-deserved petty revenge on their consistently tardy coworker by having her struggle to open rolls of coins throughout her shift. One has to wonder if the coworker was intelligent enough to connect the dots and realize that she was being asked to open an obscenely large amount of coins for one employee during one work shift, but who knows? It also sounds like she might not be the brightest bulb.",
