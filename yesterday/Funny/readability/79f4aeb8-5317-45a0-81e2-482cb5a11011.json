  "description": "We want to make one thing clear before we start here. We love all cats. All of them - big and small, wild and domesticated. We love fluffy lynxes and their huge mitten paws. We love the perpetually annoyed and confused jaguarundis. And we love - goodness - do we love housecats. For our little fluffy children, we would do anything. With all that said… we do have a special spot in our hearts, just an itty bitty corner, for a particular kind of cat who simply steals our hearts all over again every time we see it. Pallas' cats. We don't know what it is about them. Maybe it's how fluffy they are, maybe it's how large they are, maybe it's the fact that Pallas' cats place their paws on their tails when they're cold, or maybe the fact that they are literally always grumpy. Whatever it is, we love them a whole lot. And this Pallas' cat momma just had six of them - six smol kittens who are even clumsier, grumpier and derpier than her, and we're beyond in love. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.
