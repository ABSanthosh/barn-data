  "description": "For some reason, it seems like companies and employers love to give employees hope and reasons for motivation, and then take it all away at the last moment. We all know that they love dangling promotions and raises over employees' heads even if they have no intention of giving them to anyone. And apparently, these are not the only motivations some companies use to squeeze more work out of their already hardworking (and overworking) employees.When a company wants to get their workers to do more work, without giving them anything in return, they can use what employers love to call 'an annual bonus'. It is a vague extra sum of money that companies add to workers' paychecks at the end of the year, that is supposed to reflect the appreciation of all the extra work employees have put in.If a company is truly evil, like most of us know they usually are, they can decide to simply not give that annual bonus at the end of the year, and ignore all the hard work they have put their workers through. How will the workers react to this move? Keep scrolling to read this story and find out.",

They wanted more labor and they didn't want to pay for it, so they came up with this false annual bonus to get their way.No one should work for companies that take advantage of their employees in this form, and we truly hope neither will the workers in this story. Hopefully, this company will learn that giving its employees what they deserve is much better than losing them all at once.",
