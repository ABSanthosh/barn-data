  "description": "Hey there, pawrents of the internet. We know you know how lucky you are, but it never hurts to be reminded. We get to experience the meowgical beings that are cats literally every day - we get to cuddle with them, see them as they make adorable airplane ears, and simply bask in their cat-like glory. Not only that, but having deemed ourselves worthy of their love, we get to be loved by them. And that, dear friends, is the greatest gift of all.There is no love like a cat's love. Dogs love everyone and they aren't afraid to show it. Cats are picky about the hoomans they love, and once you're chosen, you're chosen for life. Sure, they might get a little grumpy if you feed them late too many times, but they will be yours furever despite it all. We found a heartwarming helping of lovestruck felines that we just had to share with you, to remind you how lucky we are to be so loved by our cat companions. Enjoy!",
