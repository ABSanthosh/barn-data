  "description": "When it comes to working at a place with long periods of down time and free wifi, it's difficult to stay off the socials. It's pretty standard knowledge to not do anything personal on the company's wifi, especially not on a company laptop or computer, because they can use that against you. If you have a manager or boss who is already out to get you, then you should really avoid being online when you are not supposed to be. Listen, we know it's hard. When you have a job where you find yourself just sitting there twiddling your thumbs until a customer shows up—of course you want to do something like check your IG feed or scroll throw funny videos on the Tok. But try your best to resist.  In the case of this Redditor, it was Reddit itself that was one of his downfalls. That and using the company wifi to look for a new job… LOL Amateur hour, my guy. However, it was a Reddit post that he created that his boss cited when he was telling him why he was being let go \"effective immediately.\" The thing is, he definitely wasn't the only employee going online on the company's dime…",
