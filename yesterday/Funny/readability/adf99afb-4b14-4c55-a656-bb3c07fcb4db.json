  "description": "Howdy, feline fam! We missed you. We know it's only been a few days, but it always feels good to come back to family. We took a few days off to travel, and we have to say that we've come back purrfectly… sleepy! It may have been a vacation, but now we feel like we need a vacation from our vacation. We may be back at work, but we're not the same purrson that left. We've successfully adopted the \"if I fits, I sits\" meowntality to our work days, and let us tell you, it feels great.That's right - we left and came back pawsitively ungovernable. There isn't anybody in the world that can tell us to do something if we don't want to (except our cats… we listen to them no matter how tired we are), and the power is flowing purrfectly through us. We do enjoy sharing these hissterical cat memes with you, so don't worry, there's plenty more where these came from. We will, however, be promptly leaving after eight hours, without so much as a word goodbye. And that, dear friends, is the \"if I fits, I sits\" mentality at its finest.",
