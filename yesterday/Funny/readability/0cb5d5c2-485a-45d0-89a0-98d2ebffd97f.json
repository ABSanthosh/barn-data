  "description": "Weddings can make everyone's sanity fray at the edges a little bit, but when this woman found herself floundering beneath the pressure of her materialistic alter-ego, everyone involved with the wedding got crushed–including guests, friends, family, and everyone she ever knew on Facebook. It's understandable to feel like you're going a little cuckoo during the wedding planning process. With a million decisions to make, a strict budget to follow, and your 10-year-old Pinterest board judging your every move, it always feels like you're making the wrong call. However, the delicate line between a stressed-out bride and a bridezilla gets crossed when a prospective bride starts lashing out with entitled demands. The woman in this next tale takes the cake on insane requests, insisting that each guest attending her wedding contribute $1500 to fund an exorbitant, out-of-budget, Kardashian-style wedding.",

But once the lady in our next story was convinced to ‘go big’ on her wedding's budget by a local psychic, she was convicted of her lavish tastes on a pauper's budget. I certainly wouldn't be RSVPing ‘Yes’ to a wedding that required a cash-only gift that cost me more than a one-week vacation to Bermuda. Keep scrolling to read the insane details and ridiculous fallout to a fairytale love story that fell apart before it ever began, just because a woman was too obsessed with ‘being a Kardashian’ for a day to realize how out-of-touch she'd become with reality.",
