  "description": "Good meowrning, friends and felines. If you know anything about kittens, you know that they should be with their mothers until they're about 12 weeks old. Any sooner than that, and you have to do the mothering for them. It's also crucial for their mental and social development. But, life isn't purrfect, and oftentimes kittens are separated from their meowthers too early. Sometimes it happens naturally, and other times, hoomans are the cause.After hearing the meows of a poor kitten outside, one teen went to check out the situation. He found a 6-week-old kitten crying for help, all alone on their neighbor's property. He did as any of us would, and took the cat in to start caring for it. A few days later, he found another one around the same age - it seemed that their neighbors were leaving these kittens outside to fend for themselves. The kitten formed an emeowtional bond with him, and the neighbors never said a thing. Scroll down to read more about these adopted (stolen?) babies below.",
