  "description": "We don't know why, but we have been seeing so many stories lately about neighbors and cat trouble. We have seen everything from people stealing their neighbor's cats to people holding their neighbor's lost cats \"for ransom\"… we don't get it. Cats are so great. People should love cats. The cats and their well-being should be everyone's first priority. Maybe we've been hanging out around a weird crowd, because that's how it's always been for us. People have usually been kind, so we couldn't understand it. And we've been looking for a story that would give us hope again. And today, we found it. There was so much potential for drama here, but none of it happened. Two weeks ago, when we came across this story for the first time, when this mailwoman was contemplating if it was ethical to take someone else's cat to the vet, we were worried. But today, when we finally got the update, and things went as beautifully and amazingly as we could have… Yeah, we needed this.",
