  "description": "Try to name a more iconic pair than cats and sleep. Go ahead, we'll wait. Actually, we might just curl up and nap while we do. And snooze. And stretch. And snooze some more. Why? Because deep down, we might actually be cats. And cats? They practically invented the art of sleeping. Their love affair with sleep is the most enduring romance we've ever seen.Cats sleep so much that the internet is basically full to the brim with memes and jokes about their eternal naptime. Honestly, there's plenty of time to make them while cats are snoozing their days away. They don't know, of course. They're completely oblivious. Why? Because they are- can you guess it?- asleep. Very surprising, they're asleep. Shhh… don't disturb them - they look far too precious when they're curled up and sleep like this.Celebrate the nap masters themselves with these adorable sleepy cat memes. Just don't let them make you too drowsy… unlike us… yawn… zZzZzZzZ…",
