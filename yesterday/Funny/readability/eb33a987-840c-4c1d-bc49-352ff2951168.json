  "description": "Who among us wouldn't quit their job for double the salary? It'd be a hard question to say no to, that's for sure. No matter how much you love your job, you could vastly improve your life with double the amount of money. Usually, when you find a job that could double your salary, you have to inform your company that they either need to match that amount, or you'll be leaving. It's not personal, it's just finances. But still, some bosses think that your loyalty to their company should be stronger than your loyalty to the almighty dollar. An extra $50k, $100k, or even $120k like this person was offered, could all provide you with an amazing life. It would mean more vacations to luxurious destinations, or giving gifts to all your friends and family, or maybe buying a badly needed new car or home. Most bosses understand that loyalty just can't compete with all that… but not every boss gets it. This person had an odd interaction with a boss who did take that salary boost personally. This person, u/raredontstare, also posted an update a few weeks later sharing what happened in the aftermath of the whole situation. Check it out below!Then, read about these irritating bosses, like one who asked an employee, \"Can't you just be late to your other job? You have responsibilities here.\"",
