  "description": "Happy Meownday, feline fam. It's an unavoidable thing that as cats get older, they eventually start having more and more health problems. Such is life! We can try to avoid it as much as we can, but it's just a part of getting older. Well, this sweet senior cat started having some breathing problems, and it worried her owners. She is 15 years old, after all (although to us, she doesn't look a day over 10). Well, they did the responsible thing and took her to the vet. The answer they got though, was not what they expected!Spoiler alert: she's purrfectly healthy, but she's thicc with a capital T, fluffier than a stack of pancakes, a plus-sized powerhouse….she's chonky (and yet funky!). The only thing she needs to get healthier is a few less treats, a diet, and a bit of exercise. It's as relieving as it is funny, and we think that you'll get a kick out of this hissterical cat story below. It's certainly a pocket of sunshine on this cloudy, winter day. Enjoy!",
