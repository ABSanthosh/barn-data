  "description": "As a society, we are much more accommodating these days to dietary restrictions than we used to be. We've found ways to turn just about anything into protein, discovered what feels like a million types of plant milk, and know how to make bread with no bread in it. Science has been able to adapt to allergies, diets, and fads in ways that were unthinkable just years ago. Along with the physical progress we've made, there's much social progress as well. Vegans and vegetarians aren't painted as the hippie-dippie types anymore, and oat milk is the most popular coffee addition in cafes today. It's become so easy to accommodate these issues that it's almost second nature. Yes, it would almost be silly to deny someone their right to a meal just because they \"eat funny.\" We should all strive to make everyone feel comfortable, and it's now just practical to do so. This is why one woman came to the internet to ask for advice when her extended family cut her out of their big family trip altogether because of her genuinely serious dietary allergies. Is she right to be upset? Or should she just sit this one out? Read on to decide.",
