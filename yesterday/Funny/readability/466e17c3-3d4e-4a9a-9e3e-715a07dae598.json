  "text": "You can now kick it with Darth Vader in Fortnite, which filled the weekend with bizarre audiovisual snacks, but nothing like what we saw at the beginning; the creature has no doubt been lobotomized several times since then. I guess the Dark Lord of the Sith said a no-no word, but it was only part of an attempt to make sure that players understood that this king of language was unbecoming of a Jedi. Literal father shit! I suspect that is a form of nuance that Disney might have a hard time appreciating, but still. And of course we can't have nice things - this robot would be too interesting to fuck with. I don't know what force on Earth could keep the zoomer from cracking such a salient pop cultural geode. The problem I have with AI shit is when it is based on unauthorized usage. I don't think computers are bad, or whatever; when we advocate for the human voice in art and commerce it's only to suggest that you pay for what you are feeding your digital animal. If a person trains an LLM on their own stuff and then does whatever with it, I don't think you should go automatically go to jail for anything that we might consider AI or AI adjacent. Stealing a person's voice is weird and bad, like it would be if you stole their art or writing or, you know, sandwich. But I think if somebody says, \"Hey, maybe would be cool if I could collaborate and make science fiction from beyond the grave, and maybe continue to wake care of my progeny in perpetuity or as long as being give a shit about Star Wars,\" the dad in me responds to that.  And that's what James Earl Jones did!  If AI were treated more like part of the world, as opposed to some cosmic spider or interdimensional weapon, these conversations would be a lot more productive.   (CW)TB out.",
