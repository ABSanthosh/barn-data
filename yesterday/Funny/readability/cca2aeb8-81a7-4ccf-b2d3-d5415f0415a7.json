  "description": "Happy Tuesday, friends and felines. We love being cat pawrents. We really do. We love being greeted by our fluffy felines the second we walk in the door, having them loaf on our chests or in between our legs while we're curled up on the couch, and most of all - we love kissing their tiny, purrfect little heads. However. We do not love when they break a lamp at 3 AM in the middle of their midnight zoomies, or when they decide to wage an epic battle against our toilet paper while we're at work.These are some of the many meowments we pawrents face in our daily lives with our cute cats. But, we did know what we were signing up for, so all we can do is just laugh about it. Below you will find some snapshots of cats just being cats - their pawsitively ameowzing, purrfectly cute, and curiously chaotic selves. It may be annoying, but we wouldn't change a single thing about them.",
