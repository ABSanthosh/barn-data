  "description": "Oh, Monday. What a meowing day. It's inevitable, but we wish Monday was a choise day. Like, are you ready for Monday? If you're not ready, skip it. Just like that. But unfortunately this isn't how Mondays work.When we think of skipping days, Mondays or otherwise, we think of the ultimate day skippers - cats. Cats are so chill, and cats can sleep for most of the day, so they can simply skip a day if they don't want to take part in it. Cats are so unbothered sometimes that makes us jealous. We also want to be completely unbothered by Monday, for instance. Doesn't it make you want to be a cat?If some magic would turn us into cats the first thing we'd do is skip the nexy Monday. What a great power. But with great power comes great responsibility… and that's completely irrelevant here. Cast the Monday mellows away, you funky little floofy feline. Enjoy this not-Monday for as long as you want. Well, at least until Tuesday.Until Tuesday actually comes to replace this Monday, you can enjoy these cheesy cat memes to pass the time. It's the human way of skipping Mondays.",
