He keeps sending me Yasuke videos that are essentially physical comedy; potent Spartan kicks that lift enemies and launch them from Japan to, I assume, the deep cisterns of Sparta itself. Enemies get caught up in a gentle zephyr and dance and sway in a foul wind. It's orthogonal to the typical experience, but in these map fucking games where you gotta fuck the whole map, sometimes a change of pace might be welcome…? He does stay skipping. Just because I need to be special and different I guess, I started out skipping Monster Hunter cutscenes because I was trying to get to the endgame with my friends and also because that's the meme. Then I ended up watching one and being blown away by the incredibly sophisticated animations on these beasts. I didn't really understand that it was kind of a Kaiju thing, which is pretty stupid in retrospect, maybe as dumb as possible, but after I finished the game I essentially went back through the looking glass and watched all the cutscenes on YouTube. So, not a huge time saver over all. The one game he didn't skip story on was The Witcher, which… I mean, yeah. They make it worth your while. That's a CD Projekt RED thing in general - you can't skip, not ever, because you never know when it's gonna be awesome and they're always hiding the best stuff off the beaten path. Hey! It's a powerful #Frigabe stream today - Mork is gonna fire up the stream today at 10:30 so we can check out the new season of Marvel Rivals. It'll be him, Kara, Dirty Dwab, myself, and we may have some carry potential from young Noah since he is home for spring break. Come through! (CW)TB out.",
