  "description": "Some employees are lucky enough to work for companies that offer generous reimbursement policies, including lunch stipends, mileage reimbursements, and even perks like work-from-home equipment or home office spending allowances. Honestly, that sounds like a dream. Meanwhile, plenty of people are stuck fronting the bill for things that should be covered, like driving across town for a meeting or buying basic office supplies when the company printer runs dry.But then there's the other extreme: employees who take advantage of every loophole, expensing things like artisanal water or a $15 \"client meeting\" that's suspiciously just brunch with their roommate. Reimbursement policies can be a blessing or a curse, depending on how petty people are willing to get, which brings us to today's story.",
