  "description": "What a Meownday it is, feline fam. We awoke this meowrning, like we do almost every meowrning, to our cat stepping on our face to wake us up and demand we feed them breakfast (at 6 o'clock in the morning). We've grown to accept this, although we must say that in the beginning it was quite the back-and-forth between us. Like all good hooman servants, we caved, and now we get up at six to feed our cat breakfast, then go back to bed.This is our cat's toxic trait, and we're sure your cats have some hilarious traits as well that you wish were non-existent. The cat pawrents of the internet confessed, and let's just say that we're happy ours just wakes us up in the early hours of the meowrning. This thread is not only silly, but purrfectly relatable. Just know that you're not alone, and all of our cats also drive us a little coo-coo for cocoa puffs sometimes. Scroll down and enjoy all these hissterical kitties below!",

Luckily, our cat doesn't do that. She just makes biscuits on our faces  until we wake up to give her food. It kind of feels good, until one of her paws gets into your mouth. You wake up real fast when that happens! This is the worst!! They trick you with affection and desire for cuddles, only to sneeze directly into your open mouth, or even worse, your eyes. It's the worst kind of deception. They may not do it on purrpose, but we think they might. Let's be honest, they're cats. Everything they do is on purrpose.",
