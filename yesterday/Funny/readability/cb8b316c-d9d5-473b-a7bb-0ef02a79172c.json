  "description": "Happy Holidays, everyone! Another year has come and gone. The work is winding down for the year, and families are starting to gather to celebrate Christmas, Hanukkah, and other winter festivities.Many families celebrate by decorating for the holidays. Around Thanksgiving, someone in the family will insist that everyone in the house goes to the attic or basement and bring out all of the decorations. Someone is tasked with untangling the lights, while someone else can start hanging up stockings on the mantle. Picking the perfect Christmas tree is fun for the whole family, too! But as you can see below with this sleigh-full of holiday fails, it's all too easy to mess up your decorations. The cat-owners of the world have a hard time keeping their Christmas tree standing up and decorated. Cats view Christmas trees as their own personal playgrounds! There are branches to climb, shiny baubles to bat at, and even water at the bottom of the tree for them to drink out of (how thoughtful of their owners!). One person shared how their cat demolished all their trees' lights because their cat \"got hungry.\" Oh boy. There's always next year! Happy Holidays from all of us at Fail Blog! May the next year send only the funniest of fails your way. Up next, read about the dollar store boss who's making his employees pay out of pocket for store supplies, leading one befuddled employee to share, \"It's just very weird and customers aren't happy.\"",
