  "description": "Not everyone was born to be a baker. The truth is that when it comes to cakes, cookies, and all forms of dessert, there are two types of people: bakers and eaters. A chosen few may fall into both categories, but we should all be honest with ourselves and our relationships to dessert. Personally speaking, I am an eater. In fact, my sweet tooth has been the source of many an unfortunate evening involving late-night calls to fast-food restaurants and bakeries that I'd like to pretend never happened. Still, as much as I love all forms of cookies, I am keenly aware of what my limitations are. As someone who spent the better part of 2024 trying to cook healthier dinners for myself beyond a bowl of pasta with store-bought pesto, I cannot fathom taking on baking as a new hobby. Firstly, because as much as I appreciate a freshly baked cookie, I simply do not have the patience and attention to detail to be a good baker. Second of all, and more importantly, if I suddenly became a good baker, my physical health would plummet even more than it already has. At least now, my bank account can stop me from making another late-night delivery order. One has to maintain some boundaries in this world.Keep scrolling below for these Redditors' biggest baking mishaps from the past year. When you're done, feel free to take a look at this compilation of ridiculous holiday bonuses that employees received.",
