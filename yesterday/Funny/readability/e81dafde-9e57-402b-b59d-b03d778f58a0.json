When I started playing D\u0026D in our very first live play podcast (maybe THE first live play podcast?) I fell in love with the game right away. I quickly started running my own campaign and what I came to realize is that I liked using the books as a sort of starting point for my own rules and systems. Eventually I got rid of the D\u0026D books entirely and made my own game Thornwatch which took a lot of the modifications I had made to 4th edition D\u0026D and expanded on them.  When it came time to take another crack at Wizard Kart I decided to once again ditch the D\u0026D books entirely and make Super Wizard Kart its own game. Players showed up without their character sheets and learned how to play right there at the table. You can check out the final game right here: If you’re curious about how I built and designed the game you can check out my post from earlier this week or hit me up on Bluesky. If you’d like to run the game yourself, you can download a PDF of my rules right here.  -Gabe out",
