  "description": "Do you have that one coworker who you watch do nothing during the workday, mess up when they actually decide to do their job (which isn't often), and the boss still loves them somehow? You've likely dealt with a colleague like this at least once in your life, and that's because underqualified employees exist everywhere in the workforce. If you have one on your team, it'll turn into a sour reflection of your work ethic, even though you know you're a top performer in your company. When you have a \"useless\" slacker on your team, all it takes is one big mess-up for you to open your eyes to just how much your coworker has impacted your work life.In this next story, an employee is left frustrated after their clearly underqualified coworker deletes over 15 hours of completed work from a project their team was working on. The employee proceeds to explain how \"useless\" their coworker is in every capacity and is now going to their boss to light a fire under her. Scroll to read.",

Of course, you'd probably be in disbelief, possibly in the bargaining phase for a few minutes. Then, when it sets in, you'll try with everything in you not to jump across your desk and give your inept coworker a piece of your mind. But you expected them to mess up at some point, didn't you? They never were able to to anything on their own, and your instructions constantly fell upon deaf ears. It's time to go to the big boss, me thinks.",
