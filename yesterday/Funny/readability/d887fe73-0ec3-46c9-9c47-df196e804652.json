It's also possible he's just a huge fan of Critical Role or something but also wanted a little carcinization, as a treat. I'm so excited that Clank! Legacy 2, our next Acquisitions Incorporated collaboration with Dire Wolf, is finally in people's hands. It's been such a pleasure to lurk around on the various boards where it's being discussed and see what people think. We're also in this very nice, very gentle window where the game has a 9.3 out of Ten on BGG which is just not a thing that happens there. I know that it can't possibly retain it, because of how math works, but man! I'm glad the first people through the gate are really enjoying it. Making games with us is only a very, very small part of what they do - I knew the OG people from there from back when they were making digital trading card games for Everquest and, like, Stargate? For some reason? They were part of that huge SOE umbrella back in the day, and I was so pleased to learn that they'd found a cool way to move on. Aside from making their own boardgames, they also make digital versions of their games and other people's games. That's also why they have a fairly sophisticated companion app for their games that does way, way more than you would expect - even adding new ways to play with custom rules. If you're gonna get down into Clank! Legacy 2, you'll want to grab their Dire Wolf Game Room app because not only does it have a campaign tracker, it also has a fully voice acted version of the Book of Secrets with way more audio production than I thought was gonna go into it. I hoped it was gonna be cool, but it ended up being awesome, which is at least two or three rungs up. (CW)TB out.",
