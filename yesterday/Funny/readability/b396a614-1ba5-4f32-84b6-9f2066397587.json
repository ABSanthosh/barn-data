  "description": "The tipping debate continues on: some servers love working for tips, while others wish they had a much higher hourly wage instead. There's a certain type of customer who loves to complain about tipping culture to the waiters themselves (and anyone else who will listen!). They are usually grumpy already, so nothing to the waiter says to them will permeate their brains. This customer shows up grumpy, not just because they're hangry, but because they're bitter that they have to tip. Many non-tippers are seemingly ashamed of their habit. It is a faux pas to just not tip your server at all, and if you do it in front of people, they'll probably give you a side-eye. Perhaps the worst thing you could do is inform your server that you're not tipping before you even get your food. Why would you want to insult the person responsible for your impending dinner? It's a terrible idea, but for that customer who's eager to complain, it's just a common-sense thing to do. They just don't have any empathy for their waiters, and they look down on them, which gives them a reason to avoid shelling out extra cash for a tip. Up next, read about the entitled mother of 12-14 year old tweens who demanded that an airline passenger move to a middle seat: 'This is about needing to sit next to my kids.'",
