  "description": "Imagine learning mere months before your wedding that you're in serious financial trouble because of your fiancé's gambling problem. Of course, this was a problem you thought had been resolved, only to learn that you're in more debt than you ever had been before. How would you proceed in this situation? You can't possibly open a bank account together while you're in this much debt. Then, you would have to assume his problem. You can't possibly pay for the expensive wedding you had planned when there are more imminent financial concerns. You have to put any other expensive future plans on hold as well, such as having children or purchasing a home.This is not just a hypothetical scenario. This actually happened to a bride-to-be. Here's what she had to say about her relationship drama!",
