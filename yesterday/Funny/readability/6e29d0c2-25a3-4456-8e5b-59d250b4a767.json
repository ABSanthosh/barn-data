  "description": "This entitled neighbor 'forgot' to pay his Internet bill, then proceeded to corner the guy next door about using his Wi-Fi from afar, but he stood his ground. What's mine is mine. If you're a reasonable adult paying your bills on time and enjoying the pleasures of a regular paycheck and a comfortable life, you're entitled to bask in the spoils of your work. Internet, power, water, and gas are all a few 'luxuries' that get dealt with on autopay, deemed essentials to enjoying your living space to its full potential. So when your neighbor comes to try and reach into your home and your safe haven, they're risking the integrity of your hard-earned livelihood. With that in mind, when the stranger next door approached the guy in our next story about using his Wi-Fi password, he rightfully refused. Adamant about protecting his home's security and Internet integrity, he shut down the advancing neighbor. But that wasn't enough to stop him from bad-mouthing him all over the neighborhood… Keep scrolling for the full story.",

Perhaps next time, this guy will decide to pay his bills on time or even go to a coffee shop for some free Wi-Fi. There are plenty of other options that don't include accosting your neighbor for what's rightfully theirs. Besides, if he spent half the time on fixing his life as he did on trashing his neighbor, he'd probably have his problem solved by now.",
