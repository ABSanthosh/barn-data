  "description": "Howdy, feline fam. We like to think that there is good in everyone here at I Can Has Cheezburger, but we also know that some people can't be reasoned with. We can be okay with some people not liking cats, we can be okay with people thinking it's okay to put pineapple on pizza, but we can never be okay with people who treat their pets like toys. Toys that you can just get rid of whenever they're no longer fun, without a second thought.When you adopt a cat, it is a 10-to 20-year commitment. You don't just get rid of them when they're no longer convenient. You made a pawmise to them to love and care for them their entire lives, and to break that promise is unforgivable. So, we understand this purrson's dilemma with the thread below. Their sister-in-law gave up her 3-year-old cat for adoption because it was too much with the cat and her two kids, and then two months later, adopted a new kitten.
