  "description": "Getting food or a drink when you're in a rush can be a high-stress activity. Sometimes you're running late to work or an interview, and you know if you arrive hungry or uncaffeinated, your performance will suffer. So you make the choice to stop and grab a coffee, and of course, that's the one time they take forever to make your order. It'll be the one time that the barista decides to clean the espresso machine surface before making your beverage, or they'll be out of that sandwich you ordered, and they'll have to grab it from the back room. The whole time, they'll be moving as slowly as possible, as so often happens when we're rushing. This person had a maddening experience while trying to grab a coffee. The baristas took so long to make the drink that they made this person late! And that's not all to the story, as you can read about below. After that, read about some dates that went wrong, like one person who sadly \"Made cake for a girl and got stood up and ghosted.\"",
