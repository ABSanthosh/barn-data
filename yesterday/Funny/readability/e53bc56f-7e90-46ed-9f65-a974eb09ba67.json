  "description": "David was integrating a new extension into their ecommerce solution, and found this un-representative line: $this-\u003emodel_sale_manageorder-\u003eexportOrder(substr($selectid,0,strlen($selectid)-1)); Note the use of substr- we take the substr of $selectid from 0 to strlen($selectid)- aka, we take the entire string. Perhaps this is leftover code, where once upon a time there was a prefix or suffix on the string which needed to be ignored. But the result is code that is rather dumb. I call this an \"un-representative line\" because, according to David, the rest of the code in the extension was actually rather good. Even otherwise good code is not immune to having a little fart hiding under the covers, I suppose.
