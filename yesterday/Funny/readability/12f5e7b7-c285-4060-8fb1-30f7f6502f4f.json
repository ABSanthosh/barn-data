  "description": "Are all boss actually physically allergic to giving their employees a moment to rest, or is it just something that is in their nature? Where does the need to boss people around come from? (Pun not intended, surprisingly.)We understand that managers want your employees to do as much work as possible while they are on the clock, because they are quite literally being paid to be there. But sometimes, especially in fields like retail, there truly is nothing to do. Why is it so wrong for employees to just… rest? Why must they busy themselves with meaningless tasks just in case the boss comes in and sees them looking hardworking and busy?If we could have a focus group with a bunch of managers and ask them these questions, we would, just so we can listen to them attempt to logic their way out of their toxic leadership. But since we can't really do that, we might as well get a laugh out of bosses who realise their mistakes, like the one in the story below.",
