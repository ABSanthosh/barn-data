I’m gonna get real weird with it’ — these guys, probably Though Charlie, Dee, Mac, Dennis and Frank are some of the most conniving, scheming and selfish people in their fictitious version of Philadelphia, there’s one superlative the Paddy’s Pub crew probably can’t claim: Being the weirdest folks in the greater It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia universe. The debate on the series’ strangest character began last week when Additional_Tax_475 took to Reddit with a question for their fellow Sunny fanatics: “Who is the weirdest character” on the long-running sitcom? Don't Miss Much like any other contest, fans were largely split on which role deserved the not-so-coveted title. While several cited Gail the Snail, Frank’s fake son Franquito, Artemis and the famously incestuous McPoyle clan as prime contenders, others named the cat-identifying Maureen Ponderosa as the one to beat. “Every iteration of Maureen Ponderosa was better than the last,” wrote Bulky-Key6735, before commending actress Catherine Reitman on her portrayal of the cat/woman incarnate.  “Maureen, I’d have said the McPoyles usually, but she was willing to marry one and also turned herself into a god damned cat,” added JacedFaced, while Dustmopper simply opted to quote her brother, Bill Ponderosa from Season 12’s “Making Dennis Reynolds a Murderer.”“Ever seen a grown woman take a dump in a sandbox?” they wrote, recalling his iconic line. But to Merijeek2, these side characters’ respective strangeness fails to hold a candle to the series’ actual resident weirdo: none other than the gang’s own Frank Reynolds.“He doesn’t need to be surrounded by any of this, but he’s there because he WANTS to be,” they observed of the ultra-wealthy Sunny patriarch, who famously subjected himself to squalor, an unheated apartment and, of course, a poop-filled bed. He did basically say it himself: “I don’t know how many years on this Earth I got left. I’m gonna get real weird with it.” Tags: News Scroll down for the next article SIGN UP FORA WEEKLYNEWSLETTER OF JOKES + TRIVIA",
