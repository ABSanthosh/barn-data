  "text": "Published: November 30, 2024 EL SEGUNDO, CA—Revealing that split ends have grown 50% stronger in just the past decade, a new study published Friday by researchers at the L’Oréal Academy warned that overuse of hair detangler was giving rise to new product-resistant supertangles. “When hair detangler was first developed, we arrogantly assumed we would be living in a world without snagging, but now we face an even bigger threat to smooth, silky hair,” said study author Vicki Zhou, explaining that decades of reliance on hair-detangling technology has led to the evolution of supertangles, which can survive the standard chemicals used to improve follicle manageability. “We could be entering a time when even the most powerful oils and silicones are powerless to contain frizz. These supertangles were localized problems at first, but salon overprescription has led to a vicious cycle in which people are dependent on using stronger and stronger hair detanglers to prevent complete knotting, and scientists can no longer keep up. Right now, top L’Oréal researchers are working around the clock to develop new conditioners that can hydrate, strengthen, and detangle all in one, but if that doesn’t work, we could be looking at a world where all hair is matted and clumped.” Zhou also warned against the development of lab-engineered ultra-snags to test out stronger detangling products, citing the dangers of these supertangles escaping their containment facilities.
