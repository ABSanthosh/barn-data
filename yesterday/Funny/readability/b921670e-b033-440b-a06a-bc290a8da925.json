  "text": "There was always a lot of \"boy stuff\" I was never particularly good at, or interested in - and there's an important nexus between those two concepts. Also, like… my dad woke up at three in the morning to go fishing, according to some Naiad Lore whose provenance was never fully explained to me. Also, you had to be quiet in a boat for about a thousand years. Reader, let me tell you: it was a task at which I did not excel. Gabriel was a disappointment also but time heals all wounds. Writing this strip reminded me that my own father essentially did what Gabe did in the strip. Eventually you come to the conclusion that hating a dead person isn't merely a useless investment, it's also just kind of weird arguing with a corpse. So, every now and then I remember something about him unfettered by an eleven year old's perspective and some of it is kind of cool. My sister was his actual son. I don't say that out of some kind of pique, or anything - I was never jealous of this. She was way better at it than me and it took the pressure off; I could spend way more time gently caressing the Amiga 500. But he did reach out to me! He bought games of sports and we played those. When I remember Leaderboard Golf it looks like you're watching golf on television - apparently, that's not so. Football, also. 10th Frame was photorealistic! It also needed a Dongle to play, which taught me the word \"Dongle\" which has brought me pleasure for decades. If there is one that actually gets down to it, really down, it was Cribbage. We had a Cribbage board, and cards, but he bought a Cribbage game. It was only single player, but we played it together. He tried to meet me where I was. I'm not sure I understood that until about five minutes ago. (CW)TB out.",
