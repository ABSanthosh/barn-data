  "description": "Oh boy, feline fam, better go grab your nearest box of tissues because this one is a tear-jerker, a heartbreaker, a soul-shattering story from which only the power of our love for cats can heal us. We normally like to keep things light and fluffy over here at I Can Has Cheezburger, but sometimes, we have to get real. Bad things happen in the world sometimes, especially to good people. All we can do is try to pick up the pieces afterward.Our cats have helped us get through more trying times than we can count. Technically we saved them from life in a shelter, but they saved us many more times over. They are there for us in our most trying times, and for that, we are purrfectly grateful. When this feline-loving girlfriend falls ill, her boyfriend makes the bittersweet promise to cherish, love, and protect her cats after she passes. She left, and now he has them to remember her by. Scroll down to read the whole story below, and we're serious - get some tissues.",

  "text": "In our relationship, we were the one who loved animals. We begged our partner to let us get a cat, but we just weren't in a place where we could adopt one. Finally, when we moved into a bigger place all on our one, we went out and got one. He went with us because he loved us, but we were the excited ones. We adopted a kitten and instantly bonded.You know what happened next? They fell in love with her too. He went into full “dad mode,\" caring for her every whim and whimsy, cleaning up after she made a mess eating, even bringing her on him to snuggle at night. They always cave in the end, don't they? This is heartbreaking. We can't imagine how the cats are taking this. They don't understand any of it other than the fact that mom isn't home anymore. They might think she left them (in a sense, she did). But at least they still have a dad that loves them and will protect them at all costs. Members of the cat community joined in to comment on this story - scroll down to read all of their heartwarming commentary below. We wish for everyone to experience the healing and love emanating from these people.",
