  "description": "Having annoying neighbors is one of those universal frustrations that instantly unites strangers. Personally, I live in an old, creaky house on the bottom floor, and every time my upstairs neighbor so much as shifts in their chair, it sounds like they're rearranging furniture during an earthquake. Most of the time, I just deal with it. I pop in my headphones, crank up some music, and pretend I'm living in a trendy, intentionally noisy loft.But sometimes, no amount of noise-canceling tech can drown out the noise. If you're like me, you probably start by politely asking your neighbor to keep it down... emphasis on politely. Nobody wants to start a full-blown feud over footsteps. But when they flat-out refuse to change their ways, at that point, they're basically begging for some sweet, petty revenge.And that brings us to today's story. One guy had been dealing with his nightmare neighbor for far too long. He tried to be reasonable, but the neighbor just wouldn't listen.",
