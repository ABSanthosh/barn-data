  "description": "As long as the work gets done, employees should be allowed the courtesy of needing to dip out early if they need to... When micromanagers are strict about this sort of thing, it's usually because they have an insecurity or superiority complex. They need to feel like they are being strong managers, so they focus their energy on the silliest of details, such as clocking in and out a minute behind or ahead of schedule. Of course, any confident and intelligent person would know that unless an early or late departure seriously jeopardizes the work day—and it usually does not—then it really should not be a problem at all.",

Now, employees had to request PTO under these circumstances. Of course, that's not going to stop employees from needing to go to the doctor, so when this author took a personal day for their next appointment, his boss finally was able to see how unnecessary and silly this new policy was for everyone involved. Several members of the online community chimed in with their reactions. We've included their thoughts below as well!",
