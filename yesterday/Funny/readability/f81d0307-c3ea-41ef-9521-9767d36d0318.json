  "description": "Let this list serve as an unfortunate reminder that far too many people in this world do not think before they text, post, or send. Whether it's a message to a friend, a social media announcement, or an email to an employer, one would think that every semi-intelligent adult would consider checking their spelling before making their point. However, it seems that we're not dealing with semi-intelligent people here.This compilation of misspellings ranges from someone who posted their \"alphet\" from the night before in what was supposed to be a flex to someone who literally thought filet mignon was spelled \"flaming young\" (truly spoken like someone who has never had filet mignon). People make mistakes all the time, and sometimes we write messages before we've had our morning coffee, but spellcheck and Grammarly exist for a reason!Keep scrolling below for the full list. When you're done, check out this list of folks who are probably having a worse day than you are right now.",
