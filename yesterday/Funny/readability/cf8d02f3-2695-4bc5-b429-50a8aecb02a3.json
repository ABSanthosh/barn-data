  "description": "Servers put up with a lot of nonsense. At the restaurant, the customer is king, and oftentimes, they let the weight of that crown get to them, becoming the most insufferable version of themselves just in time for dinner. This server in our next story reports a tale so classic and so relatable that waiters and waitresses everywhere cringe with second-hand embarrassment, while revelling in the tiny victories from behind the counter. Deals make Karens turn feral. Catching up on their coupons, disparaging a minimum wage worker for a managerial special, or bothering a service industry employee until they get something for free is a Karen's favorite hobby, giving them feelings of power in a soul-sucking way. The woman in this next story thought she was being clever when she cornered her server into analyzing the menu, pointing out tedious details for add-ons in an attempt to cheat the pricing, but despite her lack of mathematical skills, she never once realized she was even saving $2—but not before wasting everyone's time at the table.",
