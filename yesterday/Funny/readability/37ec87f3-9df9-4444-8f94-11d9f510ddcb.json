A regular joe-shmo lady has a home that needs basically the entire interior repainted. A guy who does occasional house painting as a side gig happened to share this information on a neighborhood Facebook page. This Karen really jumped at this opportunity to see if she could exploit and get her conniving way. It was so absurd that this person responded with a laughing emoji because he did not think she could possibly be serious. She actually told this guy she's pay only $50 and he'd get \"great\" exposure… She's is not an influencer in any capacity and also, what??? Exposure to keep having to paint entire homes for $50?? That sounds horrible, Karen.",
