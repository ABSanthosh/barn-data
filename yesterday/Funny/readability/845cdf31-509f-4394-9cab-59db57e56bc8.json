Good luck trying to replace a hobgoblin like the Mork with a single foe.

Maybe it's fixed by now, but Gabriel didn't have an opportunity to be mad about a truncated soundtrack because he game no worky. My grant to study it is in limbo thanks to the new, so-called \"administration,\" but I can top-line the thesis for you: Tony Hawk is bioaccumulative, meaning that it builds up in the organism at a higher rate than it does in the environment. I tend not to buy remakes or remasters or remaindered stock anyway, but I have tonied so many hawks at this point that I don't think I could possibly tony any more hawks. I did, like, the thing on the baggage carousel so many times that when I see a real baggage carousel I hear punk. I think it's fine if somebody else wants to, but my skate cortex is just a wisp of trapped smoke in the cavity it chewed out of my brain. I ain't doin' it. It would be like going to the doctor to have the cancer put back in. (CW)TB out.",
