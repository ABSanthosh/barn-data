  "description": "Shakespeare had a way with words—but for many of us who enjoy a good YA novel over a literary mouthful, we'd argue that Shakespeare had TOO MANY words. And for the sketchy car dealership salesman who was profiting from ill-fated swindles, he certainly contested that Shakespearean literature was far too wordy for him… Especially after receiving 10,000 texts containing transcripts of his plays after ripping off a disgruntled customer. Perhaps it was fate that brings us here today or the pursuit of a nobler revenge story. Simply put, this customer had accidentally purchased a lemon vehicle, condemned yet cleverly disguised as a good buy. But when his mechanic noticed a tiny detail he missed at the dealership, all was lost. Or was it? Keep scrolling to read how this guy used Shakespeare's works to get petty revenge (and a refund) at the hands of a villainous and deceitful car salesman.",
