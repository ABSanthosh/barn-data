  "description": "Have you ever been fired? It doesn't even matter if it's from a job you were expecting it from or even hoping it from—it still does not feel good. The anxiety you instantly feel inside is like an elephant on your chest. Even when it's a toxic job that you wanted to leave, it isn't until a few days later do you feel any sense of relief. That being said, sometimes you are able to mentally prepare prior to the actual firing and in that moment you can decided whether to bow out quietly and keep your peace or go out with a bang and get some petty revenge.  Obviously, we encourage leaving with your peace… but we LOVE when people leave with a bang! The internet is filled with stories about fired employees getting their last hoorah before exiting that toxic workplace for good and we can't get enough of 'em! Here you see an employee who was bull!ed from day one getting her revenge and we applaud her.",
