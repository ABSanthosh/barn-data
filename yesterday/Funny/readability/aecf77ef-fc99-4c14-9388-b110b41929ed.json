  "description": "Cat… I am your father. Every Star Wars-loving cat pawrent has tried to convince their feline that they come from a long bloodline of Jedi knights, but for some reason, our lazy kitties just want to lull about in the sunshine of the windowsill instead of fulfilling their destiny to defy the Empire. Alas, despite my cat's obvious Jedi reflexes and keen ability to control my thoughts ('these are the cat treats you're looking for'), he still won't pick up a lightsaber. Purrhaps, the only option is to inundate this cat with the lore of the galaxy once again, watching and rewatching our favorite Star Wars flicks in honor of May 4th. Sing the songs of an infamous intergalactic jazz band, and may the Force guide your feline through their late-night zoomies, skittering like young Skywalker in his first pod race on Tatooine. For the Force is mysterious and powerful, binding all life and bringing joy to everyone—just like the cuddles of a floofy, soft cat.",
