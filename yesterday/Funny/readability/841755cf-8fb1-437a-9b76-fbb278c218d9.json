  "description": "Contractors seem to always get burned when it comes to payday. My dad is a general contractor and despite working for luxury clients whose remodel budgets almost always exceed $10 million, they somehow always think of new excuses to avoid paying for $1,000 invoices and petty cash deals. When it comes to closing out a payment that's a drop in the bucket, why do customers get so stingy? The job is done, now you have to pay. That's why a lot of contractors refuse to start work until payment has been received, but in some cases that's unavoidable. This cyber security expert in our next story had a client that he believed was good for their cash, until he realized on payday that they were just as cheap and unreliable as Scrooge McDuck.",
