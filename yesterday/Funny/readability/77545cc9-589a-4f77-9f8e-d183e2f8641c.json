  "description": "Unfortunately, we know that we cannot adopt every cat that we see. We want to, but there is a limit. That doesn't mean that we can't help as many cats as possible. TNR - trap–neuter–return - oftentimes, this is the best solution. If you see a stray cat that is struggling, and you want to help, one of the best things that you can do for them is take them to a vet and help them get better. And although we know that not everyone can do this either, we certainly encourage as many people as possible to do it if they can. That is what this person thought they were going to do - they just wanted to give this cat a quick TNR, and that is it. But the cat was too sick to be left outside again. It would not have survived on its own out there. So, this rescuer took it as a sign… that this cat was meant to be theirs. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",
