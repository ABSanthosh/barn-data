  "description": "Nobody is above the law, not even people who work in law enforcement, especially not people who work for law enforcement. Not only are they not above it, but if they try to use their status to their favor, they should definitely not be getting away with those kinds of actions.The main problem is, that not many people would be willing to stand up to people like that. It is not easy to stand in front of an officer and tell them that they are wrong, or that they are using their power for \"bad\". People who are brave enough to stand up and call out law enforcement people like that, definitely deserve some kind of award.The resident in this story did just that when they encountered an entitled driver who kept parking in their private parking spot. At one point, the resident decided they had enough of that behavior, and blocked the entitled driver's car with his own, essentially preventing him from leaving. That led to quite a dispute when the driver returned to their car, realized he couldn't leave, and pulled out a badge to intimidate the resident into letting him drive off. Keep scrolling to see how that worked out for him…",
