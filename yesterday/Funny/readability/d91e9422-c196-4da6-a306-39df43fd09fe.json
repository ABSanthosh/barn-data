  "description": "Growing up with siblings gives you a unique perspective on fairness. If you and your sibling are very different people, you're going to bear witness to some very different parenting styles. Often, older siblings are subjected to rules and regulations, while younger siblings get much more leniency. Older siblings can have more pressure to perform, to carry out the family's legacy, and to live up to the family name. Sometimes, it can be frustrating to watch your sibling receive gifts and privileges that you were never awarded as a kid. Especially if you are far apart in age, you may have had a completely different upbringing entirely than your sibling. This can sometimes lead to resentment and hurt, but, for the most part, it's just the way the cookie crumbles.One woman experienced this divide in parenting with her sister, who is ten years younger than her. This woman grew up with a lot fewer privileges than her sister and was expected to move out when she was 18 and put her way through school. When her sister asked her why she moved out so soon, this woman told her the truth, which caused her mother to accuse her of guilting her sister. Read on to see how it all plays out.",
