  "description": "I would be overjoyed to say that all these lures and snips of prose and epitomized human forms all constitute pornography, but I won't unilaterally disarm. I think it's okay to be a weird little freak and fuck your aging necromancers or your sex vampires or even, in rare and select cases for the real sickos, human beings. People get super mad when you talk shit about their porn, and that's sorta how you know it's porn. I wish there were a way to, in a robust and ongoing way, simply admit that people have kinks without making them into purity spirals and empowering endless grifts.",

I know I said it last time, but I really did think we'd crossed this bridge! All this preening, Jesus Christ. I keep trying to figure out why it's happening, because it will never be resolved and can never be resolved, but I think I'm just going about it the wrong way. It's just a kind of moral play that we all get subjected to because none of them can shut up ever, for any reason. It's just a game you can play forever; a supertoy that will last all summer long.
