  "description": "The post-Christmas stretch between Christmas Eve and New Year's is the time of year when many employees cash in all of their unused PTO. It makes sense. The week feels like a liminal space filled with strange leftover sandwiches and playing with the gadgets you unwrapped on the 25th. The last thing any employee on PTO wants to think about is their boss, but some bosses will always be thinking about their subordinates.The original poster (OP) of this story made the mistake of responding to their boss's text message while they were taking time off from work. This invited their boss to continuously leave more messages for the OP to answer, and the OP soon realized what one text message meant for their work/life dynamic. The OP decides to calmly tell their boss that they'll answer any other questions when they're back from their holiday, but the boss seems like he wasn't fond of that answer. Either way, that's his problem, not OP's. PTO is PTO is PTO.",
