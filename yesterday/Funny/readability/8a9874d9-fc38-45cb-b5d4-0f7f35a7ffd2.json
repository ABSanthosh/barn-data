  "description": "Hello, cat pawrents! Or should we say \"Good meowrning\"? We're sure we need to tell that to your cat, at least, because while you were waking up this morning, they were still sleeping; while you were drinking your morning coffee, your cat was still sleeping; while you were leaving the house to go to work, your cat was still sleeping; while you started to do your job, taking care of all your responsibilities, being a good employee, guess what? Your cat was still sleeping.Wouldn't you like to sleep like your cat? We know we would. Like, we wouldn't object to sleeping 16 hours a day and then nap for at least 4 hours more. Sounds like a purrfect sleeping schedule to us. But that's why we look at all these sleepy cat memes all the time - because we'd like to be deep in sleep like them, because they're cats.So here we are, looking at these memes, and thinking they need to be shared. There you go, these sleepy cat memes are here for you to use. Send them to your boss - they might send you for some mandatory sleeping time. You have nothing to lose.",
