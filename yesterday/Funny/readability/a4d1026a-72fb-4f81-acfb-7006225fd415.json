  "description": "Well, here we are again, feline fam. Another cat rescue story, but this time, there is more than a happily ever after….there is sweet, sweet revenge. Imagine getting a cat and then wanting to give it away - actually, we literally cannot imagine it. We cannot imagine ever wanting to part with any of our cats, but then again, not everybody loves cats as much as we do. One feline lover rescued this awwdorable grumpy cat from their owner, who wanted to sell him for the ripe price $5. Not only did he get a completely unique cat, whose naturally grumpy face is priceless, but now the cat is actually internet famous (obviously), and the wholesome feline savior is going to make some extra tuna money for her social media following. Some say revenge is a dish best-served cold, but we say that it's best when served with a big, fat check. Scroll down to see more pictures of this cute, cantankerous kitty below!",
