  "description": "We don't know what it is about neighbors being so awful when it comes to cats, but that seems to be a thing. We have heard of neighbors abandoning their cats and leaving them to fend for themselves, which is bad enough, but apparently, it's not even the tip of the iceberg. We have heard of neighbors stealing people's cats knowing that the cats belong to someone else. We have heard of entitled neighbors demanding people give their cats to them because they need the cat more. And today, we come across one of the most entitled neighbors yet. It's been a year since their cat has gone \"missing\", a year since their neighbor found the cat, rescued it, attempted to find its owners and been told by the vet that the cat is in such poor condition, there is no way it belonged to someone else. A year, and suddenly, these neighbors remember that they had a cat, start asking around about it, and once they find it, demand to get it back. The audacity is baffling.",

A year passed, and they just now remembered to check with their neighbor about their lost cat? Yeah, no, you do not owe them anything. We wholeheartedly believe that this cat is in much better hands with you and that this is exactly where he should stay, no matter how much they fuss about it.  17 18 By any measure, this is your cat now, and you have no reason to give him up. If you want, maybe you could offer letting them visit him, but not anything beyond that.
