  "description": "Good meowrning, I Can Has-ers. We think all cats are beautiful, from the meowjestic maine coons to the standard-issue tabby cats that are a dime a dozen. Each cat has their own unique traits that make them beautiful and we don't need a fancy or rare fur pattern to convince us that each cat is the most beautiful cat in the world. That's because as long as the cat wants love, trusts us, and considers us its family (or servants, as the case may be), we think that that is where the beauty comes from.Now, don't get us wrong, our jaws still drop when we see a beautiful bengalâ€¦we have even been known to stop in our tracks for a sultry serval cat every so often. But those physical things don't matter to us, and they also didn't to the wholesome people in this post! They found a stray street cat in need, fell in love with him and adopted him, only to realize later that he is a \"designer breed\" that is not only uncommon, but expensive.

Each and every one. Even the mean ones (they have their reasons). We had a dog-like cat when we were growing up. She was a tortie and full of toritittude. She played fetch better than our dogs. She would meow at us until we pet her, and then even more if we dared stop. It was the best. We miss you, Meow!
