  "description": "The struggle is real returning to work after a long weekend. Thanksgiving weekend gave us a glorious break filled with family, food, and an unreasonable number of leftovers we promised ourselves we'd \"get creative with.\" But now here we are, back at our desks, daydreaming about turkey sandwiches and that last slice of pumpkin pie waiting for us at home. The chaos of holiday gatherings has seamlessly transitioned into the chaos of work, and it seems impossible to get back into the swing of things. Maybe we should just take off until the new year.The Sunday scaries were at an all-time high this weekend, and now they're vying a little too close to a Monday meltdown as you stare at a calendar full of meetings you barely remember scheduling. Your inbox is overflowing, your coffee is lukewarm, and you can't even begin to think about the spreadsheet you completely \"forgot\" to finish before the long weekend. If you're struggling to stay awake after a carb-heavy holiday binge and the long break, you're not alone. These 25 work memes are here to help you laugh through the pain. Let's survive the workday together.",
