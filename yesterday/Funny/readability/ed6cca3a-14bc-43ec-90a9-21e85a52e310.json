  "description": "We all have idyllic visions of our family, especially our grandparents, at least for those of us who were fortunate to grow up with grandparents who showed us nothing but love and kindness.It's weird, though, when you grow up and realize that your own in-laws are also going to be your kid's grandparents and extended family—which puts everything into a new perspective. And no matter how you feel about your in-laws, there are always going to be some strained moments. What's somehow even stranger, though, is coming to find that for your sibling's kids, you're either \"dad's side\" or \"mom's side\" of the family.Anyways, given how we feel about our grandparents, if your kid is telling you in earnest that they don't feel comfortable going to grandma's house, that alone is saying something. These parents didn't feel comfortable letting the kids go around to their grandmother's house with her relatively unknown boyfriends around, their repeated refusal to let the kids come over prompted her to take matters into her own hands, resulting in this confrontation. Frustrated, the mother shared her story with this online community to see if she was wrong for her part in the escalation. See a selection of the story below, along with some of the community's responses.",
