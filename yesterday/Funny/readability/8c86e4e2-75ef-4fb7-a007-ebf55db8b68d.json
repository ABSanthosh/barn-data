  "description": "This contractor proved the value of his time by invoicing a company for wasting it. Higher-ups in the company always seem to think that meetings are more important than they are, but have you ever considered why? While the workers—the ones in the field actually doing the job of the company—are the ones with their boots on the ground, familiarizing themselves with every nuance of the job site. The suits in hardhats have no clue what's going on on a daily basis, so they need those meetings to catch themselves up to speed. Alas, once again I'll say it—most meetings can be summarized in a quick email. But for the big bosses, that's just too much effort. So when an advising contractor was told he had to be onsite for every team meeting every day, he decided to see if the company he was working for truly believed their meetings had value… Monetary value. Keep scrolling to see how this guy spent weeks billing his foreman for overtime hours, expensing his malicious compliance and ultimately earning his freedom to work at his own discretion.",
