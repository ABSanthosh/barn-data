  "description": "Ahhh, the Fourth of July!What a weekend full of fun, food, and festive celebrations! There are countless reasons why the Fourth of July is every American's favorite weekend of the year… and here are four big reasons:1.) The mouth-watering feasts!Hotdogs, hamburgers, potato salad… the list goes on. It's the one weekend a year (alongside Thanksgiving, of course) where all dietary restrictions seem to fly out the window…and we're not mad about it!2.) Quality time with family and friendsIt's a time when our nearest and dearest come from near and far to celebrate our nation's independence together. There are few things beat sharing this time together and making memories with our loved ones.3.) Flag displays and the 'perfect' American decorWe wear our pride on our sleeves, and hang it on our walls! Red, white, and blue become the ultimate color combination, and suddenly every corner is filled with American flags…making us wonder if this could be a look for all year round. 4.) And last but not least: the fireworks!Vibrant, colorful displays that light up the sky and remind us how lucky we are to call America home.But… as much as this weekend is all about fun and celebration, it's easy to forget about our neighbors. So where do we draw the line between a wild, joy-filled weekend of noise, fireworks, and partying and showing respect for the people around us?",

They know that the 4th of July weekend only comes around once a year. However, it is important to respect those around you, and when your neighbors are partying until 3 a.m., going haywire with their fireworks (putting your house at risk) and leaving their trash on your front lawn, that is when your boundaries become a bit stretched thin.",
