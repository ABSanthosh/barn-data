  "description": "We love big cats. We love big cats so much it's not even funny. We want to pet one. We want to hug one. We want to be friends with… all of them. But we understand that it's not possible. We understand that wanting something does not mean that you should have it. And we can live with that knowledge, because we understand that this kind of friendship is forbidden to all humans, that this is a pain we have to share. Except not. Except that some humans are luckier than others. Some humans become friends with lions, even though that's not supposed to be allowed. And some humans get to cuddle with cheetahs and be fine, completely fine. And some humans have caracals nagging them while they are working from home. And this person got to become friends with a random wild bobcat that showed up in their house, and you know what? We're done. When is it going to be our turn to become a Disney princess? Please…",
