  "description": "The fallout that comes after the holidays is always challenging, especially after spending time with difficult family members. Not only do you need to get yourself back into a routine before returning to work, but you also often need some space to recharge and recenter yourself after having virtually no time to yourself during the week of Christmas.Don't get me wrong, it's lovely to spend the holidays with your parents as a fully grown adult. Sometimes, you get to revert back to being a kid for a few days, but that comes with its disadvantages as well. Now that you are a fully grown adult yourself, it's nearly impossible to ignore all the ways in which your parents' way of life is unhealthy, ridiculous, or just straight-up aggravating. Here, we have a 38-year-old woman who just hosted her mother for the week of Christmas at her place, since she lived closer to where the whole family gathered for the holiday. However, after the mother's basement flooded, the 68-year-old woman wanted to extend her stay for the following week. In theory, this is justified and understandable, but we trust the Redditor that her needy mother was using potentially minor damage as an excuse to stick around.Keep scrolling below for the full story and for some commentary from yours truly. For more stories like this, take a look at this post about an employee's revenge on her lunch-thieving coworker.",
