  "description": "When we tell you that 2024 has been crazy, oh, we mean it. Because while it's true that cats rule the internet and that there are a million viral cat stories every single year, somehow, this year, it felt like there was more, like people were looking for something to distract them. And one of the most interesting new kinds of viral cat posts that we have seen was about cats with unique and rare fur patterns. Every cat is purrfect, that is known, but there is something meowgical about cats that are a little different than most. Whether it's cats with vitiligo whose fur looks like the night sky or cats with strange eye colors that you swear can see right into your soul. This year, we have spent our time celebrating not only the common but also the things that make us - and cats - unique. So in honor of that, we have decided to put together the most viral, most interesting cats that we have seen this year.",
