  "description": "The only time I ever use photomode is when I push whatever that button is on accident. The boss I'm fighting will freeze in place, no doubt as surprised as I am, and a ton of UI elements unrelated to boss killing will bloom all around him. Maybe he's surprised to learn that he is a character in a game at all; a mechanical speedbump on my ascent to martial excellence. It's rude in that context to go back as though nothing happened but once I figure out what button I pushed, you know, that's how it's gotta be.",

It's rude in that context to go back as though nothing happened but once I figure out what button I pushed, you know, that's how it's gotta be. I think that if you can draw, maybe photomode isn't a big hook for you either. You can just imagine things, and then if you move your hand in a certain way you can deposit these fantasies in the real world. It's a really cool trick. But, I dunno. He just got one of them Pros, and maybe Shadows is fancier on there somehow, but he's texting me pictures he takes in-game. He's got me looking at a looooootta cherry blossoms, bro. Sakura type shit. For my part, I have been trying to figure out why just one week ago I was a Marvel Rivals God of Death - I guess that would be Hela, in this instance - and now abject defeat is my only lot. It's rare that I even attempt to git gud, but when I have demonstrably gotten good I haven't seen a reversal of fortune like this in a whole minute. The match starts and it's like some pack hunting dinosaur has broken containment and now I can't get out of the spawn. I spend a lot of time on my ass, lifeless eyes looking up at the sky, and I think some of the people I'm fighting now are actual superheroes IRL. (CW)TB out.",
