  "description": "We joke all the time about being a millennial cat dad because if you can't make fun of yourself, you're taking life too seriously. Recently, it was Father's Day, and we sent a sarcastic, yet silly, note in our family group chat accusing everyone of not wishing us a happy Father's Day. Our parents responded with, \"But you're not a father!\", to which we said, \"How dare you! Mr. Whiskers is our child!\" We weren't really upset that nobody wished us a happy Father's Day (even Mr. Whiskers), but the sentiment remains true: he is our literal cat child.And he's way more purrfect than any of your hooman children, anyway. He's clean, only cries when he's hungry or we haven't paid enough attention to him, and we haven't once had to change his diaper (he doesn't even have a diaper). So, if you're like us and you treat your cats like your fur babies, welcome. This is a safe space for you. And better yet, we've got a bunch of cat memes that just make sense for us pawrents. Enjoy!Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",
