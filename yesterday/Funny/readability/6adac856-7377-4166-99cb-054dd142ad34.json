  "description": "Bobcats. We don't know if talk about them enough, but we're about to correct that. Because while we love every single cat out there, the more we learn about bobcats, the more we seem to fall for them. Bobcats are playful, and they will break into a golf course if they see a ball there that they want to play with. Bobcats are affectionate, and they will take in kittens from other families and other species and raise them as their own. Bobcats are silly and get attached to the silliest of toys, even if that toy is just… fennel. And bobcats seems to be learning… little by little, that some humans are not so bad. Now, that might not always be a good thing. Wild things are wild for a reason, and most of these cats still stay away. But some make the same calculation that house cats do… maybe sticking around humans, especially when you are in need of help or are vulnerable, like this momma bobcat who just had her kittens, is better than being in the wild.  Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.
