  "description": "Happy Fursday, feline fam. We've heard of adopting one cat before, even two or three, but nineteen?! That must be a new record. Don't get us wrong, having nineteen cats sounds like a dream - a giant, fluffy dream filled with cuddle puddles and cat hair. Unfortunately, we don't have room in our house for nineteen cats, but if we had a farm, well, that's a whole other story. Luckily, we don't have nineteen cats to adopt, but the guy in this post does!While working on his farm, this man found not one, not two, but nineteen cute kitties in his barn after discovering that it is a popular place for people to dump their unwanted pets (don't even get us started on these people). Well, there's always plenty of work to do around a farm, so at the very least, mice and gophers won't be a problem anymore. Scroll down to see all of these kitties snuggled into one giant feline family photo and read more of the story below!",
