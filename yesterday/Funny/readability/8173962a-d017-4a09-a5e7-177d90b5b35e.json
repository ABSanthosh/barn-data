  "description": "Whether you live in the country, suburbs, or city, having a good neighbor is elite. When you get along with the person who lives closest to you, it is like all of the planets have aligned and you can live in peace now. It's just nice knowing you have someone near by who will have your back and be able to get to you the quickest during an emergency. That's what a community is for!  The only problem, it would seem, is that finding a good neighbor isn't the easiest task in the world. There are countless posts of people ranting about the nightmare that lives next to them. Entitled neighbors who think the world revolves around them and you only moved in next door to do their bidding. It's atrocious. Luckily, some of these Karen neighbors get put in their place—like this male Karen who loved to pretend a shared lot between him and his neighbors was his dumping ground.",
