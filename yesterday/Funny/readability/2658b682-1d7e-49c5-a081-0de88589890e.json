  "description": "If we had a nickel for every single outlandish thing any of our toxic bosses have ever said to us, we'd probably be able to buy a million-dollar mansion. It's kind of a right of passage for employees, new and old, to get berated by their entitled superiors. Maybe there's something in the water that many bosses drink, but more often than not, you'll be faced with a manager or supervisor who thinks they're a god.So what do you do with all of the sour memories? Well, you can report them to HR. If that fails, you can either escalate the situation to court or even better, rant about them on Reddit for everyone to see and comment on. If the situation can't be remedied, it makes for some solid, yet twisted, entertainment. The employees who wrote about their experiences in this Reddit thread have a lot to say about their bosses' questionable mentorship tactics, but we'll let you be the judge of that.",
