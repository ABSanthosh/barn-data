  "text": "A few weeks ago I was in California and I still have to write about it but I haven’t yet because I came back and fell into a depression followed by the flu (GO GET YOUR FLU SHOT). But when I was in California my friend Jenny sent me a dm to see if I wanted her to give me an insider hookup since she’d worked in Monterey for a decade. And I didn’t see that message at all because I suck at checking messages and then a week later I saw it and responded, “I am literally just seeing this now. Jesus. wtf, me?” and I expected to her to say, “Well, my friend, you suck, obviously.” But she didn’t because turns out she’d just gone into hospice for the cancer she’s been fighting. But Jenny is a bad-ass who has been fighting cancer for 8 years. She almost died three times last year and always came back like a fucking champ so I sent her another message telling her how much I love her. Sent. Not read. And today she is gone. I took this picture of her 16 years ago at a Blogher Convention. That was the night we discovered Chambord and we poured it into every drink we had. We called it “Unicorn Period” because it seemed magical and also because the name made others queasy and so no one asked us to share it. Jenny was the kind of person who would give you the shirt off her back, but mostly to show you the enormous Wear the Wild Things Are tattoo across her entire back. She sent me a Christmas card with her beautiful family on it every year (including this one) even though she knew that I never sent cards or even had the energy to put up a tree some years. Some people would really hate a memorium like this, filled with tattoos and hoarded unicorn menstruation, but not Jenny. And that’s why I loved her and why I will miss her and why I will forever wish that I’d told her all this earlier…even though I know that she knew it. But maybe you are reading here and you don’t know it, so I will tell you now. I love you. If I have met you in real life, I love you. If we were close but then drifted a little because I’m afraid to leave the house or use the phone, I love you. If we’ve never met but you are here, I love you. If I blocked you on facebook because you wrote some crazy-ass shit, I love you. If you’re reading this, I love you. I’m sorry. I should have said it sooner. ********* If you want to support Jenny’s family this is the best place to do it. Post navigation",
