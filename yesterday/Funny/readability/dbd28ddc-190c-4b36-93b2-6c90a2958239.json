  "description": "There are so many rules and social constructs one has to follow during a hiring process, it often becomes impossible to remember it all. What your resume must look like, what words you should use or avoid, how to answer certain questions during an interview, and what questions you should always ask the other side. You are constantly being carefully examined under a magnifying glass, and it is downright exhausting. You'd think that once you get a job offer, you can take a breath, but no. Even then there are do's and don'ts you should remember if you want to secure that job once and for all. For example, negotiating the salary. If you're not careful, you can make one grave mistake that might take away the offer completely, and leave you with nothing at all. This is exactly what happened to the job candidate in the story down below.We must say, we were surprised by what happened to this candidate, and rules or no rules, they may have seriously dodged a bullet when their job offer was revoked.",
