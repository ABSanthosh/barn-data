  "description": "Take a deep breath, cat people, because today is the day… finally, you can do nothing all day long. The workweek has passed, the madness of Caturday is behind us. Now, all that we have left to do is spend the day chilling. We have had enough of the crazy. All that we want now is peace. If we could spend this whole entire day laughing at cat memes and doing nothing else, then we would be happy. And although we don't know if we'll be doing it all day, we do think that starting our day with a bunch of funny cat memes will mean starting our day on the right paw. And that is exactly why were here - to bring you all of the silly cat memes that you need to make sure that you start this day with a smile and a giggle. No matter where you are right now, take a break and take a breath and remind yourself to enjoy this Funday while it lasts.",
