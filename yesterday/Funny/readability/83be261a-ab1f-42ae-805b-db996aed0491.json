  "description": "Valentine's Day is the day of love… so you better make sure you don't have a shift to work before making plans. Nobody wants to work on a day dedicated to love if they can help it, but work doesn't stop for anyone. Some folks might decide to not show up for their shifts at all or try to burden others with their special plans that they \"can't miss,\" but this is your PSA: Your coworker's job is not your problem. If they try to guilt-trip you into taking their shift, remember that they probably wouldn't do the same for you, unfortunately.In this story, a nurse explains that their coworker is very unreliable and calls out frequently. This coworker needed someone to pick up her shift last minute, so the nurse told her that they'd pick up her shift if she could cover theirs on Valentine's Day. This coworker refused to do so, claiming that she had really important plans with her husband on V-Day… If that's the case, then find other coverage. Scroll below to see what comes of this coworker's fate.",
