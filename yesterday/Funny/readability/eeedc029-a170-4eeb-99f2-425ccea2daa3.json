  "description": "Purrsonally, we believe that everyone is a cat person. Most of them just don't know it yet. They have ideas of what being a cat purrson looks like, or how cats are cold and distant, where that couldn't be furrther from the truth. Sure, some cats like their purrsonal space, but you would never know that if you stepped even one paw into our house. Our partner was a \"dog person\" before they met us. Now they say they can't sleep unless one of our cats is curled up next to them.It's always the boyfriends, husbands, or dads who say they don't want a cat. And in the end, they all fall prey to the kitten's or cat's love. We know it's going to happen, we've seen it countless times, and yet it never fails to pull on our little heartstrings. The tough-guy husband in this video found a tiny kitten in the woods near their house, and as much as he tried to resist the kitten's love, he and the cute kitty became purrfect companions.
