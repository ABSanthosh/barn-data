  "description": "Having cats… is a unique experience. You may think that cats are low-energy, low-maintenance pets, but they are not. At least not all the time. Cats sleep for about 14 hours a day, sure, but during the time that is left… they eat plastic. Or attack your curtains. Or scream for no apparent reason. Or run into walls and then look confused about the wall being as hard as it was. Cats are beautiful and ameowzing. They have cattitude. And that catittude can only be captured with hissterical cat memes. And that is exactly what we have for you all today - a whole bunch of pawsome cat memes to enjoy. You kitty is napping at the moment. Take the chance, enjoy these silly cat memes, remind yourself that not only is the madness worth it but that others go through the same things every single day as well. You are not alone friend. The catittude and meowgic affects us all, and while it is a lot sometimes… at least the memes are worth it.",

Complaining is half the fun in life.  It really is beautiful how much purrsonality cats have. When we say that they are our babies, we mean it. Because they are like little humans, running around our houses, causing chaos everywhere that they go. And we love them - no matter what they do. Babies. They are our babies.",
