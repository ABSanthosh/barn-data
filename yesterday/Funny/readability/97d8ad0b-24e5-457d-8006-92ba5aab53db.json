  "description": "If you've never had the dream of becoming a musician, you've probably still had the dream of being in a relationship with one. Going on the road and getting to be a part of the glitz and glamour. Getting songs dedicated to you. Being in the audience and thinking to yourself, 'That one up there? They're mine all mine.' It's a romantic idea, and yet, it's hard not to imagine the drawbacks. Their long nights at the studio doing 'just one more song.' Their long weeks away on tour when you can't go to follow them. The sobering reality of loving a rockstar is enough to make you throw away the whole idea. Or at least, to keep it in your daydreams.Still, whoever our partner may be, we want to support them in their hobbies or interests. And if that means letting them play in the basement with their unsuccessful band, then so be it. One woman has been doing that for years for her husband. But lately, she's been getting stuck babysitting his bandmates' kids. Should she just grin and bear it? Or does she have the right to put her foot down in this situation? Scroll through to decide.",
