Bless your heart. waltzed into that office, armed with a \"positive attitude\" and a LinkedIn-inspired belief that \"teamwork makes the dream work.\" Adorable. So absolutely adorable.Let's cut to the chase here, offices are glorified daycare centers for adults. The close-knit team bonding over lukewarm pizza and forced happy hours, although looks very appealing, is less camaraderie and more Stockholm syndrome.But sure, your coworkers are different. You've got nicknames! You've decorated your cubicle with funny memes! Oh, honey. Then came the wake-up call: overhearing your \"work fam\" filet a colleague's life choices with the precision of a master fish butcher.
