  "description": "The library is specifically built as a place for quiet. It's so people can read, study, or even just relax. It's rows and rows of books filled with knowledge and adventure are only accessible if you are in the right headspace to soak it all in. If you are there and someone is screaming into their phone about the woes of reality right next to you as you're trying to hallucinate through scribbles on some processed lumber, it's going to be very difficult. It's not easy to be transported to the wide open sea on a pirate ship or retain the facts about the human anatomy in the middle of a library if someone is next to you being noisy. That's why librarians and library attendees are constantly shushing everyone around them.  So what do you do when some tough guy entitled dude waltzing into your quiet space yelling and refusing to quiet down? This guy trying to study came up with a plan!",
