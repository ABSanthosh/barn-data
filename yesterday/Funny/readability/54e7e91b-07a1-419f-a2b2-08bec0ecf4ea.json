That seems weird to me. Am I dumb? Am I the stupid one, here? I sorta thought that would be straightforward, but then I'm a layman. There are all kinds of arguments out there. On the Paleontology subreddit, somebody was mad at the people who were mad at the Wolf-Makers, saying that as bonespeople all they have is bones and shapes so it's gotta be okay to do it this way. Sounds just like a bone worshipper, imo. For my part, I don't know if editing twenty genes in total - fifteen of which were just to make it white - means that their Satanic chimaera is whatever they say it is. This seems like conceptual inflation designed to pump an IPO, but I have been accused of cynicism from time to time. I mean, I didn't just freestyle a wolf out here on these streets. I'm not wolfing 24/7. If you can just make wolfoids, a feat previously thought to require The Witchalok Blades, maybe you and your tech-priests constitute a new life-giving pantheon. I'm not sure. As long as they promise to give these creatures to an auspicious band of young people who have recently lost their father, Eddard Stark who was Warden of the North, I guess I can tolerate a lot.
