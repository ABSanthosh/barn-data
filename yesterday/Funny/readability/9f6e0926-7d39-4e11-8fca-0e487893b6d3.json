  "description": "Cats are the ultimate mood boosters. It's like humans' mood is an astronaut, and cats are a spaceship that flies it up, up and away, so high it's in space now. That's how high of a mood a cat can help you get. Cats boost the moods of anyone, even if they don't know it. Some people don't think much of cats (preposterous, we know) - but cats can help them as well. See, cats do not discriminate between any random people to devout crazy cat ladies. Cats love everyone, and they have a lot of love to give.Now, we're also aware that not everyone has a cat next to them. It must mostly be these people who do not think much of cats (how can they? we're not sure how it's legal), but they still have access to cat mood boosting if they have an internet connection. If you want to help them be helped by cats, just send them these hissterically hilarious cat memes. Once they see the cats in the memes, they'll know.",
