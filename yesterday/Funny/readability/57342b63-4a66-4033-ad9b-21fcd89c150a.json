  "description": "These people are having some second thoughts about the people they're dating, and they're sharing the exact moments they realized they got the ick. What does it take for you to get \"the ick\" from someone while you're dating? It's often just a little thing, but a relationship is comprised of a million little pieces, so even a few things that seem off can be enough to make you cancel that second date. For example, some people highlighted an interesting tidbit: they've had dates who just didn't like any music. Not that they disliked a specific artist or genre… they just did not like music, point blank period. Many people enjoy going to concerts or dancing to music at a club, so it's just a nonstarter to disagree on something so fundamental. That's a pretty general ick, but @jadeeatskids wanted to know people's most niche red flags. One person's super specific dislike is the guys wear basketball shorts under their pants. Another person loses interest if someone has really bad handwriting. And people are also highly specific about the types of tattoos and piercings they like! You can check out these funny and very specific dating icks down below.Up next, read about the college kids who baffled their teachers and peers, like one person who was upset that the professor \"didn't send him an email reminding him homework was due.\" Welcome to the real world, dude!",
