  "description": "When you grow comfortable in your role at work, you understandably start taking more workplace initiative. You know the ropes, you know your boss, and you hope all of your efforts to do more without being asked to will count toward a generous raise. Many bosses appreciate employee independence and initiative, while others see their subordinates as a threat to their position. Sometimes, subordinates are after their boss's job, but others are simply trying to get a bigger paycheck for doing menial tasks… and there's nothing wrong with that!In this story, an employee and their coworker take on some interviews at an MD's private medical practice. They were asked to do so by their boss, and these interviews were scheduled in a way that aligned with their schedules.Their boss was having a bad day and blamed both of them for things that were not in their control, then proceeded to scold them for changing interview times (despite them doing so because of lateness on the boss's part). As a result, they were asked to stop doing interviews. Well, that's her problem now!",
