  "description": "Merry Christmas Eve, feline fam! In our house, not a creature is stirring, especially not a mouse (thanks to our apex predator kitties). We're purring with excitement over Christmas Day tomorrow, but we have one thing left to do: make some milk and cookies for Santa Claws. We have two problems with this, though:We're out of milk, butter, and sugar (and energy, tbh)Santa Claws wrote us purrsonally and told us he was on a diet this yearSo, instead of leaving out sweet snacks for our calorie-counting Saint Nick, we're going to leave him the next best thing - meowrvelously merry cat memes! Think about it - they're something you can take with you in the sleigh on your way to the next house, they keep you giggling throughout the very, very long night shift, and they're a healthy treat that won't weigh down your sleigh ride all the way back to the North Pole. He's got a pawsitively arduous journey ahead of him, so let's add some jolly to his jingle with the help of our hissterical feline friends. Have a very meowy Christmas!",
