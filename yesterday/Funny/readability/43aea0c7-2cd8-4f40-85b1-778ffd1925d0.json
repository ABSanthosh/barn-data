  "text": "In fairness, he is at butt height As the creators, writers, producers and stars of the iconic animated series South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone have made a habit of taking a dump on beloved celebrities. And so, Danny DeVito should consider himself lucky.The running theme throughout Parker and Stone’s long career at the top of the comedy business has been how, the more famous the creative duo gets, the less they care for the pomp and circumstance of America’s celebrity culture. For instance, when Parker and Stone received an Academy Award nomination for the song “Blame Canada\" from their 1999 film South Park: Bigger, Longer \u0026 Uncut, they arrived at Hollywood’s biggest night wearing some starlets’ dresses and tripping on acid just to mock the entertainment industry’s power players and make the evening enjoyable for themselves. Don't Miss Considering their iconoclastic approach to comedy, it comes as no surprise that, shortly before Parker and Stone first hit the big time, their preferred pastime was to scour Hollywood’s favorite hang-outs for celebrities, pick a target and then take a picture of themselves farting on the star. Sadly for film and TV legend DeVito, he got the worst of their antics, seeing as his face is unfortunately fart-height. I imagine that DeVito must have been surprised to learn that the South Park guys are Canadian. Back in 1998, with South Park fresh into its second season, Parker and Stone appeared on Dennis Miller Live where they fielded a serious question from their host. “Does it scare you that you might become the people that you made fun of at the beginning?” Miller asked his guests of their newfound success. Parker answered with a story, starting, “When we came to L.A., we were such losers, like, our favorite thing to do was to go to bars and try to find someone famous, and fart on them, and get a picture of it.” Among their esteemed flatulence fatalities was Jaws star Richard Dreyfuss, whom Stone crop-dusted at a party.“The best was Danny DeVito,” Parker revealed, then commenting on the distinguished actor’s diminutive stature. “Because he’s just right there at my ass level! Like, he got fucked!”However, to answer Miller’s question, Parker admits that the tables have somewhat turned since their celebrity fart-bombing days. “What sucks about it is that, now, we have so little time when it’s like, ‘Oh, let’s go hang out at a bar,’” Parker explained. “I see people now coming up, like, ‘Let’s go fart on those guys!' They want to fart on us now!”Well, so long as it never escalated to a queef, Parker and Stone should be fine.
