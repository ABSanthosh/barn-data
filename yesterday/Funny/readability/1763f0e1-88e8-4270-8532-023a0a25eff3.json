  "description": "Being a mom is complex. You love your child fiercely and would do anything to protect them, especially from mean people, other moms, and their snobby friends, but there's a line that mustn't be crossed. Vindictive behavior against your child's aggressors hardly ever works out in your favor, but for this mom in our next story, Fate would toss an opportunity that was too good to pass up right in her lap… Or more specifically, in her driveway.Never give a mama scorned a chance at revenge, because she might just take it.",
