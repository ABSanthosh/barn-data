  "description": "One thing that will always continue to baffle us, no matter how many times we write about it, is people abandoning their cats. We cannot fathom doing that. Doing something like that is simply beyond our comprehension. But some people do it. Some people give away one of the best things about their lives without a single care in the world. But you know what that means? That means that more people have a chance of adopting these ameowzing cats. Which is exactly the attitude that the person in this story has. Their neighbors abandoned this cat, and unfathomable as it was, when the abandoned cat ran into this person's house, they saw it as the blessing that it was. And just like that, the abandoned kitty had a new home. A better home. We know for a fact that it is a better one. Because no good home could throw our a feline so lovely the way that they did. The cat made its choice, and it did it quickly.",

Our cats are our family. We lose them for two seconds and are on the verge of a heart attack. We could never understand this.  Unfortunate as this whole situation must have been for the kitty, what matters now is that he is is good hands - in better hands, in deserving hands, in hands that would never let him go again. We wish you both many, many happy and healthy years together.",
