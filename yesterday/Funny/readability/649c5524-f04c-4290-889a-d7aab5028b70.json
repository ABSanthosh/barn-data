  "description": "If you are anything like us, then you have this one habit that you absolutely cannot quit. And don't want to quit. Petting stray cats. We can't help ourselves. We do it all the time. We see a stray cat, and we simply have to try. They may not want us to pet them, they may walk away, but we have to. Would we even be true to ourselves if we didn't. And while it is true that most stray cats are not interested in us or our pettings whatsoever, some of them like us. And that makes it worth it. Befriending a stray cat is a great honor. It is an achievement like no other. These cats don't need you, they don't have to give you their time of day, but they do. Because they like you. And that means that you are pawsome. And to see that little cat get so excited when you walk by them, to see them running up to you with their cute little meows… it makes our day every single time.",
