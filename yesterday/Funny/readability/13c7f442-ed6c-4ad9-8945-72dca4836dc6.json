  "description": "Remember those days… in the past, when things weren't quite this crazy? When you could look at social media without feeling like you were being attacked from all directions? When you could just spend a chill day, without worrying, doing nothing but laughing at silly little cat memes all day long? Well, we do. And we miss it. We miss it so much. And although we don't know if recreating that same feeling is pawssible in today's world, with the pace of everything today, but we can certainly try. The one exceptionally good thing about everything remaining on the internet forever is that we actually do have access to those some hilarious cat memes that we saw back in the day. All of them are still here. And we can still, even amidst the madness, sit down and snort at some silly cat memes every once in a while. So, today, we're bringing you a taste. Some classic memes featuring the funniest felines that might just give you that nostalgic feeling that you are looking for.",
