  "description": "Heya, gamers and cat pawrents who are one and the same! We're here to give you a small break, you can actually camp here for a while and no one will get mad at you. It's a spot so purrfect for any cat pawrent who likes to game, it's a spot for you to kek and for some cat shenanigans in meme form. Get out of your high DPS mindset and unwind with us here, in the home-base of online cat comedy. We gathered a very special collection of cat memes - it is tailored for all you late-night gamers, who game when your cat is sprawled on your lap.This isn't a DLC, you can incorporate this cat-gaming hybrid meme break, just like any game genre hybridization. Your cat-gaming meme break can be a little puzzle-adventure, but it can also be casual-RPG. Sometimes, with cats being cats, it can be a little action-FPS - but that's okay, because cats will be cats, and this is exactly why we love them.",
