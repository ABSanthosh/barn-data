Because wargames exist at the nexus of tiny plastic freaks and walls of text - with affection for either marking one as somewhat outside the bounds of society - adding a little bit more text can change everything about how these poles interact. Well, they're adding all kinds of text over there - Thousand Sons got some love today, my evil bugs got some love the day before, and a couple days ago Noah - who doesn't need any fucking help at all - got some new toys as well. He doesn't know, because he can't be allowed to know. It's for the best.",

These extra rules - called \"detachments\" - are essentially incentives for building different kinds of armies out of the models you have. Or, don't have. It might make you look at models you hadn't considered up until now. These holiday detachments that have come out so far feel a little niche, maybe not top tier out the gate, but they don't cost nothin' and a lot of this game takes place in your head, between games. I'll allow it. I gotta start putting my finest clothings in a bag for my trip to PAX Unplugged out Philly way tomorrow, probably finish up Friday's post if I'm being fully strategic, but there are a few noteworthy items which are worthy of note: - One, do not hesitate to examine the Pin Quest for PAX Unplugged. As one of the most dense rosters of all time, stuffed with an amazing range from our partners as well as our own designers, there's a lot of stuff I'm gonna need from this set. This is the first time our Friend Folio will be available out in the wild, but you're welcome to slake that thirst from our own holiday shop if you want. - Two, this paragraph was originally about how if you wanted to go to the show at all, we only had Sunday tickets left.  Whelp! Last I checked there were still some Kid tickets left for that day, if you still have a few unmolted larvae. - Three, we have our second Black Remnant Main Stage game on Saturday, December 7th at 4pm EST. A combination of live roleplay and wargaming in Battletech's Inner Sphere, the underlying RPG ties into the wargame itself - and it's seamless. It's also informed by modern, story forward systems on the RP side, where players can take over the game, invent new characters, and add lore with a currency they give the gamemaster - who can then spend it against them. Black Remnant returns to #PAXUnplugged Saturday, December 7th at 4pm ET, at the Main Theatre and on Twitch! Join @ejbenson, @thekiko, @TychoBrahe and @ThatBronzeGirl for a blend of Wargaming and Roleplaying, set in the Battletech universe! pic.twitter.com/zBPvz7PFpy — Penny Arcade (@PA_Megacorp) December 2, 2024 There's really nothing like it - come check it out if you can! Eric Benson, Kiko Villasenor, and our good friend Jasmine \"ThatBronzeGirl\" Bhullar and possibly even more guests will be there.
