  "text": "Smurfs are constantly using the S-word The Smurfs have inspired comic books, T-shirts, TV shows and, unofficially, James Cameron’s entire Avatar franchise. Now the tiny blue alleged communist propagandists are back with a brand new movie that’s simply called Smurfs. This latest parental endurance test features the voice of Rihanna as the Smurf community’s lone female member, and also James Corden as the village’s lone insufferable British member. Also, Nick Offerman plays a Smurf who just looks like Nick Offerman. The reviews for 2025’s Smurfs haven’t exactly been great. Critics have claimed that the movie “Smurfing Smurfs,” calling it “a colossal pile of Smurf” and proclaiming, “I Smurf-ing hated it!”  Don't Miss Holy Smurf, that’s bad.Okay, obviously they’re using “Smurf” as a substitute for “Fuck” and/or “Shit.” This is something that the Smurfs themselves do, which is weird because they’re literally named the “Smurfs.” That would be like if we used “Human” as a swear word. Or, looking at it another way, it would be like if our species was known as “The Fucks,” which actually would be quite fitting, to be honestWhile the Smurfs routinely dropped the word “Smurf” into everyday conversation — substituting it with any, less-Smurfy word — according to the franchise’s Wiki, it wasn’t until the 2011 CGI/live-action hybrid monstrosity known as The Smurfs that the term “Smurf” started being used as a form of Smurfy profanity.That movie found the Smurfs journeying to the real world, befriending Neil Patrick Harris and acting way too horny than one would expect from the Smurfs. And, presumably to better fit this new, edgier tone, suddenly “Smurf” was used by the Smurfs in the place of curse words. “You smurfed with the wrong girl,” Smurfette declares at one point. Another character complains that they’re “up the smurfing creek without a paddle.”  In the original comic series, the Smurfs mouthed off pretty frequently, but their obscene dialogue was represented as grawlixes, implying that the adorable little Smurfs were actually dropping F-bombs (or worse).  In one comic, Papa Smurf objected to the “naughty language.”Even though he himself seemingly made an R-rated pronouncement once, too.The new movie, it would seem, tries to have it both ways. There are instances in which apparent swear words are “bleeped” by the “Sound Effect Smurf.” But at other times, the Smurfs seem to use the word Smurf as if doing so were an act of profanity, such as when one Smurf remarks, “I think I just Smurfed my pants.” Or when Smurfette suggests that they go “Smurf that wizard up” when taking on the evil Gargamel. Okay, it does kind of sound like a pile of Smurf.
