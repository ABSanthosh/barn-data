  "description": "There are laws in place that protect an employee when they're in recovery. This can look like FMLA or taking company-approved sick leave while the employee can get back on their feet. If the employee comes back before they're ready (either physically or mentally), the workplace can be liable for anything that happens to them on the job. Companies might not be happy about extended sick leave, but they'd definitely be better off without their employee for a few weeks than to get obliterated in a lawsuit.The employee in this Reddit story dealt with an entitled boss who they never really liked. Everything about their personality screamed toxicity, thus making the workplace a not-so-fun place to be. This specific employee was recovering from surgery and the story starts on one of their first days back on the job. During an overwhelming shift, the employee collapses and faints. Right when they come to, their boss tells them they need to get back on the floor. Instead of letting this slide, the employee dishes out their two-week notice.",
