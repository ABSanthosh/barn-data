  "description": "Office life can be like riding a seesaw: one minute you're on top, the next you're face-planting into a pile of uncertainty. Sales, in particular, is a thrill ride where every deal is a rollercoaster loop and every slump a panic-inducing experience. The corporate mantra goes something like this: \"You're all stars! Unless the numbers dip, in which case, sound the alarms.\" And oh do the alarms blare.Now, imagine a bright sales star whose numbers took a holiday dip, only to find himself on a PIP under new management. A third of his office is suddenly trying to \"improve\" their way back to job security. Our salesman is a stark optimist though, he wants to believe the new boss just wants him to shine brighter.Should I tell him or is one of you guys willing to break his sweet little naive heart?",

  "text": "Maybe the company is just clearing the deck, corporate-style. Something like a game of musical chairs, only instead of one person left without a seat, it's one-third. In the work game, you're as secure as a clown on a unicycle. So, having a Plan B is just being a responsible adult, or, as I like to call myself–a cautious clown. Updating that resume and networking isn't paranoia, and even if it is, it doesn’t mean their not after your job. So think of it as just good insurance against the next corporate curveball. And trust me, it’s always better to be a cautious clown than a frowning fool.",
