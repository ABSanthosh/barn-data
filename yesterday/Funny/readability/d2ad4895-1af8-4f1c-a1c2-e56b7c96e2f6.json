  "description": "Fences exist for multiple reasons, but the biggest one is privacy. Most humans live in fairly close quarters with one another, so measures are put in place to provide each homeowner with some semblance of privacy, especially in their backyards. Nobody wants a peeping Tom peeking over their wooden fence in the early morning or late night hours of the day, and nobody should have to deal with that type of nosiness.You can take all the measures humanly possible, and still have to deal with the nosiness of a very persistent neighbor with loads of time on their hands. They'll try their best to give you a million excuses for why they're looking into your yard, wandering on your lawn, and the like. Don't give in and let it slide. If you have animals, you have the right to let them loose on your own property. If the neighbor happens to be trespassing, they have no grounds to report you for loose animals. This is what's going on in the next story you're about to read, and the homeowner is seeking police intervention as a result. Scroll to read the full story.",
