  "description": "A baby's scream is biologically designed to be the most irritating sound in the world, but we're all supposed to give a little slack to new mothers because having a baby is brutal. However, this childfree neighbor, an established Karen on the block, was fresh out of patience. As it turns out, she was not willing to cut her new neighbor—a mother of 3-under-3—any slack for her screaming kids. Interestingly enough, the reception of this story was polarized, claiming both sides were in the wrong, but I'll leave you to be the judge of that.",

  "text": "Baby cries can make a person feel one of two ways. If someone is flooded with maternal (or paternal) instinct, a baby's cry will have them ooo-ing and aww-ing over the little guy, cradling their bobble heads and offering them whatever comforts their heart desires, along with a big hug and a kiss. For others, a baby's cry is like nails on a chalkboard, sending them running for the hills the second they hear it. I'm part of the latter crowd, so I understand feeling an immediate worry about a new neighbor moving in with 3 babies under 3 years old. However, this entire scenario was handled with about as much tact as a tabloid scandal, so both parties got out of hand… Quickly.",
