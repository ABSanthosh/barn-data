  "description": "When you are a pet parent that needs to go out of town without your pet, what do you do? You can ask your friends to help you out and see if they can take care of your fur baby while you're away. But sometimes you don't have friend who are willing to do that or are even trustworthy with an animal's life. So what do you do instead? You hire a professional, of course! If you're going to do that, however, you have to be ready to dish out some cash. We're talking at least minimum wage! Don't be a Karen…  Oh, but look at that, even pet parents can be entitled cheapskate Karens. Here we see a couple trying to negotiate an insanely low rate for a sitter to watch their dog for four days straight. They claim that they pay \"generously\" by allowing him to eat their food and use their washer and dryer… LOL",
