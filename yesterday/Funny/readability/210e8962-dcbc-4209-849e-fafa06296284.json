  "description": "We could never understand people who abandon their cats. It's just such a strange concept to us. How could you just get up one day and decide to get rid of your family member, someone who depends on you, who has depended on you their whole lives, who has been with you and seen you and loved you? Baffling. And yet, people do it. We come across stories of people who abandon their cats all the time, leaving them to fend for themselves or, hopefully, get adopted by someone else. So, we have seen this happen. Truly, we have. And we have seen people debate whether to get rid of their cats or not because their new boyfriend or girlfriend \"hate cats\". It has happened before. But to have the audacity to then expect the shelter that found your cat to console you and make you feel better for doing this to your cat? That's a new low. Maybe they didn't deserve to have this beautiful cat in their lives in the first place.",
