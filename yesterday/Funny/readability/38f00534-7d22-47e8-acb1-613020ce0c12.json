  "description": "One of our favorite things about cats is that each and every one of them is unique. Black cats are meowgical. They are agents of darkness. They cause mischief like no one else. Ginger cats have one braincell to share between all of them, and although most days, they will just be silly little dudes and dudettes, sometimes, they will blind you with their brilliance. Sphynx cats look like angry old men, and they act like it as well. Don't ask us to explain how. They just do. So, what happens if you take these colors and mix them up? What happens if you throw some brown onto a black cat? What happens if a cat is born a chimera - half black and half ginger? We don't know exactly what happens, but we do know that these unique and rare cats are incredibly beautiful and intriguing. So, we have put together a list of some of the coolest, rarest cats that we have ever seen, and really, it's anyone's guess how much chaos they cause on a daily basis, but we would bet that it's a whole lot.",

We'd tell him to get on the bed so that we could wash the floor, he would say no, and we would be doomed to dirty floors for eternity because we would be unable to refuse him.",
