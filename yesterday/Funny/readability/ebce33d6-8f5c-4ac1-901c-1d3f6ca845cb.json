  "description": "Let us tell you a little story about our childhood, feline fam. Our mom was the \"animal person,\" and our dad had never had a pet before in his life. Upon getting married, our mom promptly went out and adopted doggo after doggo. Our dad tolerated it, but he always stood firm and said, \"No cats, I don't like cats.\" What did our mom do? She went out and adopted a shelter cat (she absolutely could not turn a blind eye to any animal in need). Needless to say, our father was not pleased.The cat and our dad had a staring contest that lasted about two days, and then they were inseparable. The cat followed our dad around like a shadow and basically forced him to love his new kitty companion. When he would cook, the cat would meow insufferably until our dad would pick him up and hold him so he could be a part of the activity (and hopefully convince our dad to give him a little taste). He never stood a chance. Below are some purrfectly excellent examples of cat dads who never stood a chance - they're wholesomely sweet and purrfectly awwdorable!",

  "text": "Cats have this meowgical power over dads. We don't know what it is, but we think it is the source of this recurring story that happens 99% of the time. They almost always say they don't want the cat, and then they fall head-over-paws for them. Maybe it's that they both love to nap in every place in the house except for the bed. Dads and dogs go together well, too, but that's expected. For some reason, dogs have been labeled as “guy pets” and cats have been labeled as “girl pets.” We know that's not true, though. More and more guys are coming out as cat-lovers, and we have to say…that's a green flag right there.",
