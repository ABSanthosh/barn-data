  "description": "Retail workers of the world are in for a crazy day each and every Black Friday. Just in case they wanted to try and escape that day, many employers refuse to let their employees take that day off. It's so important to the sales of the stores that they need all hands on deck. They know that as soon as they open their doors to the customers, there will be a wave of people rushing to get their hands on the newest tech, the hottest clothes, or whichever toy is THE holiday toy for kids (in previous years, it was Tickle-Me-Elmo or Elsa toys). Each year there's at least one toy that people will try their hardest to get before the other customers grab them all up. All employees can do is try to control the crowds and get everyone into the checkout line safely and quickly. However, as the people below can tell you, working Black Friday can quickly become a harrowing experience that they'll never want to repeat. At least one employee had a positive Black Friday experience, though. One grocery store worker wrote that they loved working the day after Thanksgiving because, after all, who buys food when they have a full fridge of delicious leftovers? Up next, this person is refusing to buy their wife a plane ticket, just because she's working hard to pull herself out of debt!",
