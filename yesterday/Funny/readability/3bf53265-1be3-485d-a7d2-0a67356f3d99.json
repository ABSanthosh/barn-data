  "description": "Let's gobble up some delicious Thanksgiving fails! Every family has that one legendary story of the funniest way someone ruined Thanksgiving. For some, it's the time an aunt forgot to turn the stove on, and let a turkey \"cook\" in a cold oven for ten hours. For others, the most memorable moments were the time the dog ate an entire tray of stuffing, or when an uncle burnt cookies so badly that the whole house smoked up. There are plenty of ways to mess up a big meal for tons of people, and the pressure's on to make it as good as possible. Mistakes certainly do happen, as the people below can tell you. It isn't just food that can mess up someone's turkey day. As one person shared, the lines at the grocery store can be super long, and it takes ages just to pay for your food. Another person managed to get their food, but then discovered they'd bought moldy food. Too bad they discovered this on Thanksgiving day… Oh well, there's always next year! Up next, this audacious 20-year-old office worker called out a colleague, saying they \"told a nepo baby that he only has his job because of his uncle,\" and adding that he was only pretending to be humble.",
