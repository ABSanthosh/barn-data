  "description": "This worker has taken a hilariously petty tactic to get employees to reply to them. Rest assured, their boss completely hates this tactic, and the internet has informed them how dumb it is, too. Some people refer to \"email jobs\" as fake work. It's the type of job where you get paid a nice salary and benefits to work 40ish hours per week. Your boss probably doesn't care if you come in a few minutes late or decide to take a long lunch with your colleagues. That's in contrast with retail work or food service, where being even a minute late is a punishable offense, you'll have to be on your feet all day long, and you're probably not making much money at all. Email jobs aren't usually fake work necessarily, they're just much more relaxed environments where smart employees work just as much as they need to, and not a second more. This person is about to learn a hard lesson about email jobs, and it's common when you're early in your career. You might think that meeting every deadline and completing every task is key. It's not. What's really important is being a pleasant person to work with. Instead of impressing their bosses with how diligent they are about following up on projects, this person is showing their immaturity and poor communication skills. As commenters pointed out, they might be shown the door fairly quickly if they don't nip this behavior in the bud. Next up, check out some bakery mistakes and messed-up cakes, like one person who experienced a \"slight misunderstanding at the bakery.\"",
