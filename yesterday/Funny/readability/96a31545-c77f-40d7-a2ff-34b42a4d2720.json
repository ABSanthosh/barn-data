  "description": "There's something about Fridays that makes everyone collectively decide that work can wait. Maybe it's the promise of a 48-hour break (which feels way too short when you put it that way), or maybe it's just the primal urge to mentally clock out early. By 3 p.m. on Friday, Slack is silent, email chains mysteriously stop, and half the team is \"wrapping up\" for the weekend. Translation: watching dog videos and scrolling through memes until it's socially acceptable to leave.The problem is that Monday doesn't care about your Friday vibes. All those tasks you ignored in favor of weekend daydreams are still there, sitting on your desk, staring you down first thing Monday morning. But do we ever learn? Of course not. By Thursday afternoon, we're already in the same cycle, casually pretending that \"future us\" will handle it. Spoiler alert: future us is tired. But what's life without a little chaos? Here's to the Friday checkouts and the Monday regrets—we wouldn't have it any other way.",
