  "description": "If there's one thing any employee should study in their job contract, it's their company PTO policy! Make sure you know if you can save up some days that will roll over into the next year or if you gotta cash them all in before the fiscal year ends. Some folks make the mistake of thinking that they'll be rewarded for not taking any PTO, but just isn't the reality of most companies.You earned those PTO days! Getting paid for having a good time on a much-needed Christmas vacay is a part of being a corporate automaton! At least you're getting some benefits out of a 9-5…We know you're all ready for some chillaxing. It's that time of year when you can hop on a plane to warmer pastures and ditch the hats and gloves. If you've got any remaining PTO that won't roll over into the next year, you might be too late—there's always next year. For the folks who booked their vacays six months in advance, you know what's goin' on. While you're counting down the days to 2025, scroll through these well-earned PTO memes to get your head in the vacation mindset!",
