  "description": "Hello, fellow employees, it's time for another day of corporate purgatory. It's the same every single day, like we're living in a never-ending Black Mirror episode. We wake up, contemplate whether or not to call in sick, decide not to, stumble in late to work anyway, and end up sitting at our desks getting paid to send emails and watch the grueling minutes tick by until 5 p.m. Then we commute home, spend the rest of the evening dreading another day of work, and repeat. If this sounds a little too relatable, you're in desperate need of some meme therapy. Make your morning a little less dreadful by checking out this compilation of memes made for those of us running on fumes. This week has been tough, to say the least, and we're still trying to adjust to the time change that snuck up on us (like it doesn't happen at the same time every year). So, let's take a collective mental reset and grab some much-needed laughs from these memes below.",
