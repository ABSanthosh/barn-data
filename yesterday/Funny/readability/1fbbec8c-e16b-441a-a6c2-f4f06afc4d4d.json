  "description": "Happy sassy Sunday, cat pawrents! If there's one thing we know about our furbulous feline friends, it's that they bring a level of confidence and sass that the rest of us can only dream of. Cats don't just walk into a room - they strut with sass, their tail is perked up there, and the look? A look of sheer cat confidence. They don't ask for attention - they demand it with meows and purrs, snuggling up to your legs until you stop and pet them. And to be honest - we stan cat sass so much.This Sunday we're embracing that splendid, self-assured cat vibe with a comedic collection of sassy Sunday cat memes. We already know these memes are the best sassy memes - do you? Grab your coffee, tea, or catnip (we don't judge), and let these sassy kitties strut their way into your heart and speak for themselves in the matter.",
