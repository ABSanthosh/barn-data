  "description": "Growing up, it felt like parents were always making you do things you didn't want to do. Violin lessons, even though the sound of the bow on the strings made your skin crawl. Dinner at the family friend's house where the kid you had to hang out with was a glue eater. Contact sports when you have chronic shin splints. Sometimes, it felt like they were torturing you on purpose, all behind the guise of 'building character.' And in the times when you tried to speak up and tell them that you gave it your best shot but this activity wasn't for you, it always fell on deaf ears. It felt unfair, unethical, and unreasonable. Reaching adulthood makes you realize that some of the things your parents made you do actually did help 'build some character.' Maybe the violin is your favorite instrument to listen to now, or that sport you used to hate is fun to play with a group of buddies. Other times, you realize that they really weren't listening to you, and you vow never to do the same thing to your kid. One man is face to face with that issue when his wife keeps forcing their son to play squash when he clearly hates it. Read on to see how he deals with it.",
