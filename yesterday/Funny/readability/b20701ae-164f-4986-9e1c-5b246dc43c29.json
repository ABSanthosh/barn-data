  "description": "We know that a lot of people don't understand just how attached to our cats we are. They think that our cats only like us because we bring them food and water, not that our cats love us with their whole entire beings, and we love them the same way. They laugh when we say that our cats are our babies, but it's kind of true in some ways. When our cats are sick, or when our cats are sad, we feel it deeply, and when something happens to our cats that we think is… irreversible, it's gut-wrenching. And so we can totally understand the joy, the elation, that this person felt when they were told that their cat has beat cancer. Getting the news of the disease at first must have broken their hearts. It would have broken ours for sure. And we definitely would have been prepared for the worst. But no, the best has happened, and we could not be happier.",
