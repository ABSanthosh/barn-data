  "description": "The corporate world has a time-honored tradition that mirrors the old prison yard rule: new managers, like fresh inmates, must establish dominance on day one. While prisoners might pick fights in the yard, new bosses hunt for imaginary problems to solve, targeting successful employees like seasoned inmates target the unaffiliated.It's about marking territory, showing strength, and making sure everyone knows there's a new sheriff in town.Both scenarios follow the same playbook: identify your target, isolate them from allies, create problems where none existed, and make an example that keeps others in line. While prison requires physical intimidation, corporate warfare relies on Performance Improvement Plans and vague accusations of inadequacy.Our latest victim enjoyed three peaceful years at their dream job until the new sheriff rode into town, guns blazing with promises of revolutionary leadership.",

  "text": "Within minutes of their first meeting, years of success transformed into grounds for a Performance Improvement Plan. When the confused employee dared to investigate these mysterious performance issues, they received a stern warning about asking questions. Nothing says confident leadership like threatening people who seek clarity. The playbook is clear: create problems, isolate the target, prevent fact-checking, and hope they quit before anyone notices the pattern. Its not about performance - its about power. When documentation contradicts the narrative, block access to documentation. When old managers might provide context, ban communication.The moral here is that sometimes your dream job becomes a nightmare not because you failed, but because someone else needs you to.",
