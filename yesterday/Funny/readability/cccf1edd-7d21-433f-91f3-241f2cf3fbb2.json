  "description": "One of the coolest things about being a cat owner is that we love all cats, no matter their breeds, no matter where they came from. A trashcan kitty is worthy just as much as a cat who cost thousands of dollars. Because cats are just… cats. And they always behave like cats - they will have the same moments of shenanigans and love, no matter who they are. We mean that. And still, we know that some people still have a special kind of appreciation for special breed cats, like Maine Coon cats or Norwegian forest cats. Those cats are stunning and meowgestic and amazing, and we understand why someone would want that. We are also really happy to see that when things don't quite work out, and the special breed cat that you paid for turned out to not be what you wanted it to be, that people still remember that cats are cats, and cats deserve love and homes whether they are worth thousands of dollars or not. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.
