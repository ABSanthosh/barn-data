  "description": "So, it's been a long week, it's hard to deny that, but thankfully, we have one more day to rectify the mistakes of the whole week. And we think it's pawssible. We do. With enough determination and procrastination, we can get you - and ourselves - ready for the week ahead. Oh, and with a whole bunch of funny cat memes to enjoy first thing in the morning. Because let's be honest, hissterical cat memes like the ones we have for you today have the ability to fix all of our problems, take away all of our sadness, and get rid of all our mistakes. Or… at the very least, laughing at a bunch of cat memes throughout the day can help us ignore all of these things until we have no choice but to face them again tomorrow. So, that is what we are going to do. And because we think that all of you guys could enjoy some of that as well, we are going to share them with all of you guys as well.",

Because being a menace does not mean that they are also good and purrfect and beautiful, and we will make sure that they know that they are loved unconditionally, no matter how many couches they scratch up and how many thousands of dollars we have to spend because of them.  And the trash will continue to be there until the cat says otherwise. You may think that you are allowed to throw it out if it hasn't been used by your cat in a while, but you are wrong. The day you'll go to throw it out will be the day that they use it again, we promise. Ask permission first. Or better yet, never throw it away. Easiest solution.",
