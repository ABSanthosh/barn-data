  "description": "There are so many stereotypes about cats, and more specifically, about senior cats. Did you know that people adopt senior cats so rarely, even a one-year-old cat is considered \"too old to adopt\" in some shelters? People don't understand that senior cats make amazing pets. Oftentimes, cats get more affectionate with age. They understand better how to appreciate the things that they have, especially if they get adopted older. But people just want itty bitty kittens. Which is cool and understandable, and we don't judge people for loving kittens. We just wish that more people gave senior cats a chance, and beyond that - that more people didn't stop giving their senior cats less attention than they gave them when they were younger. Because it's important to pay attention. It's important because it means that you will be able to spot things like this - when you cat suddenly starts behaving completely differently, and instead of being the affectionate little fluffball that it used to be when it was younger, it becomes \"grumpy\" at everyone and everything.",

Knowing that this cat was affectionate when it was younger is important, and although we're upset that this wasn't noticed earlier by its owners, we are happy that someone did pay enough attention to figure out what was going on.  It's not just that you noticed that this kitty needs help and is scared, you are also now able to give it the affection that is was so obviously craving and missing. Being starved for love is awful for everyone, but especially for affectionate cats like this one is.",
