  "text": "If you could watch a pringle instead of eat one, just look at it and absorb it, that's essentially Love is Blind. The show is Certifiable, definition 2. It's a dating show in its molecular form, it's clearly been designed by certified (definition 1) psychiatric experts to perforate human beings, to peel them like an onion. Its structure is something like a rocket - there's a Booster Phase where the participants can't see each other, and the participants wade through waist-high gossip to and from the little chambers they make them sit in. Then, once that phase balls into the atmosphere, they get fucking engaged with these people they've never seen before and this goes all the ways you think. You gotta meet a woman's dad who hates you and hates the show and thinks it's a mockery of the society they grew up in. Then you see if any of those people actually go through with it. Then they do an episode where they get all those people later and put them in the same room! Heavy sheets of plastic are laid down and stapled to the walls because three to four people get murdered in this episode, on average. So there's a game aspect and a social experiment and weird people and it's almost impossible to look away once it gets going. I like to think of myself as beyond this form of emotional gladiator combat, but you can't be, in the same way that it would be hard to simply let a fresh pan of lasagne just exist on the counter without interfering with it. There's a bunch of stuff in there that my body needs and the reaction is visceral. Likewise, shows such as this simply make Mr. Bennet's Axiom bloom in its truth. It is an ancient human sport and we are clearly designed to excel at it. Of course, it's not real in the classic sense. It's a morality play, made from snips and chunks of reality; a variety meat. This means that occasionally human beings can be transformed into wicked enemies in the cutting room, any ameliorating virtues discarded on the floor to rustle as you walk past. Not Madison, though. Huh uh. Madison is that way eye are ell. (CW)TB out.",
