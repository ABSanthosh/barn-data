  "description": "Some offices make their interns get coffee for everyone, but this person was juggling 15 milkshakes for some reason. Maybe that's what the office was in the mood for that day, and there was just one person assigned to pick it all up. The milkshakes were contained in about 4 carriers, and this person sadly dropped them all over the ground. Tragic! Whether they were a delivery person, a random office intern, or perhaps just a milkshake enthusiast, a passerby witnessed as this dude dropped them all on the pavement. Not only did he get covered in the drinks, but another person did as well! Ugh, that sounds like a bad day for that dude, and he's not alone. Check out some other people who had bad days, like one ill-fated music-lover whose meet-and-greet didn't go quite as planned. There are also a few people who will have a bone to pick with their local bakeries for making some rather silly cake mistakes. Scroll down to see them all and decide for yourself who is having the worst day of them all. Up next, read about some employees who can't stand their coworkers' quirky behaviors, like one dude who created a petition to have a sales manager fired… but nobody signed it. Awkward!",
