  "description": "It's a good thing winter has come to an end because people are not the kindest to one another when they are facing the frigid elements. There is something about human behavior during a freezing winter that brings out our primal instincts. Suddenly, it's survival of the fittest. If you trip and fall on the ice, someone might not be there to pick you up because they are on a mission to get inside as soon as possible. To that end, neighbors become, well, less neighborly during these times. They are less inclined to help one another out and more inclined to act selfishly or just stay away from human interaction as much as possible. I myself am guilty of this, but I would never go so far as to steal my neighbor's parking spot to get inside faster. This person's neighbor had it coming!",
