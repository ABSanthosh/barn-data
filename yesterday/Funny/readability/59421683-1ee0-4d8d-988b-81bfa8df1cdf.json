  "description": "'I feel chosen' - that is what the man who found this tiny kitten says in this video, and he is completely right. That is the correct feeling to have. Cats choose their humans. That is a known fact that, somehow, not everyone seems to know. You may be going through a completely ordinary day when, our of nowhere, a kitten will jump into your lap (and your life) and suddenly, you will find yourself adopting a tiny feline. That's how it happens, and that is how it happened here. Out of nowhere, as this man was walking outside, this kitten found him and adopted him. Yes, in that order. And you can see how much love this man has for this itty bitty kitten. Everything he does, he does for her. And she clearly loves him too, riding on his shoulder, enjoying his music, napping on him. This is a match made in kitty heaven, and we cannot wait to see this fluffy cutie star in this man's next music video.",
