  "description": "Hanlon's razor is one of my favorite adages for maintaining sanity in this crazy world, and if you've read a few of these posts, you've probably seen it mentioned almost as many times. The philosophical razor states that one should \"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\" This is all well and good and helps one to let go of the atrocious and selfish behaviors they witness from others while out and about in the world: they don't mean to be that way they're just—well, dumb… I'd postulate, though, that there is a point where the two qualities of \"stupidity\" and \"malicious intent\" intersect—where qualities of significant incompetence become a point of cruelty and malevolence.This idea fits nicely in the case of this coworker who didn't excel in the areas of motivation or personal accountability, instead making her problems those of others with a complete lack of self-awareness.",
