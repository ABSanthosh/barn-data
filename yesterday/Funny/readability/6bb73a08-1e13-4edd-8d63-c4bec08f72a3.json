  "description": "Look, we think that we, as cat owners, have all wondered exactly what it is that our cats do in the middle of the night when we sleep. Are our cats calmly napping by our feet the entire night? Or are our cats causing chaos all night the way that they know they are not allowed to during the day? Either option is pawssible, but really, curious as we have been, we have not had any serious reason to put up cameras and film our cats in the middle of the night. This couple definitely had a reason. When you are spending your nights having a hard time sleeping, and you think that maybe - just maybe - there is a chance that your cat is somehow at fault, then yeah, it's time to set up a camera and see what's up. And what was up here, in this couple's case, was both hilarious and adorable at the same time.",
