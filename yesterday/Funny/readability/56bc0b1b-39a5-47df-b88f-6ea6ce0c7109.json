  "description": "Have you ever sat down in the chair at a barbershop only to realize that you may have made a big mistake? Perhaps the instructions you gave were vague. Perhaps you should never have taken your strange friend's recommendation to get your haircut at this place? Perhaps you should never have let this person cut your hair.Unfortunately, once the damage is done, it can be pretty hard to undo. After all, the way in which you get your haircut is not exactly a reversible decision. Sure, the folks in your friendship circles will tell you that hair grows back, but that's not necessarily the case either. Besides, they're just trying to calm you down and make you feel better while exchanging knowing looks at one another when you're not paying attention. Even if your hair grows back to normal eventually, what about right now?! You can only wear a baseball cap for so long! Keep scrolling below for this collection of bad hair days from incompetent barbers who, let's face it, likely have no idea what they're doing. I guess if the entire purpose was actually sabotage, then maybe these masterminds accomplished their goals.",
