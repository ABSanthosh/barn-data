  "description": "Hey Jerry! Yo. I just wanted to say thank you for talking up Sunderfolk. My girlfriend is not into video games AT ALL, but she likes boardgames. She was willing to give Sunderfolk a shot and has fallen completely in love with it, to the point that she asks me if we can play when I get home. I love that I can share something I have always enjoyed with her now. I hope we get more games like this in the future. Thanks again.  -Erik I love Secret Door, I love Dreamhaven, and I love Sunderfolk.  I did a sponsored panel for Sunderfolk at PAX with a bunch of other cool people and I charged zero dollars.  That's how cool I think it is.  There are quite a few gamers on PC that don't really understand \"Jackbox Gloomhaven,\" the phone as a controller for a co-op tactics feast is either alien or distasteful, like trying to play the game with a dead rat.  I wonder sometimes if it could have a different life with a PC specific UI, but that's neither here nor there - I'm glad you two are having fun with it.  If you need naming suggestions for any of the things you discover obviously we're here to help.
