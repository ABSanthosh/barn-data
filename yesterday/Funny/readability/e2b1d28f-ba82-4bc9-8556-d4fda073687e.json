Sure, if your kid is on the small side— say, 7-feet, 300-pounds—they might want to drink Prime in a bit more moderation. But for the rest of the hulking child behemoths, there’s nothing to worry about.” At press time, several 9-foot-tall, 400-pound children had complained of extreme heart palpitations after drinking Prime.
