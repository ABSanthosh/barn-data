  "description": "There is a new workplace culture going around these days that encourages you to find a balance between work and life. Whatever that means for you, it's the \"healthiest\" way to lead your life in this capitalistic society. Because of this, many employees are opting out of any optional social events planned by their workplace. They already have friends and they'd like to use their off hours with them—it's really not that crazy. Separation of work life and social life can be way healthier than the other way around, because usually, even if you are in a \"social\" setting, when you're with your co-workers, you are still within a hierarchy of power.  Unfortunately, there are many stories online of employees getting in trouble to opting out of social events planned by their work. It's like, they make it optional, but not really… Like when this employee opted out due to personal reasons, her manager started making her work-life a nightmare.",
