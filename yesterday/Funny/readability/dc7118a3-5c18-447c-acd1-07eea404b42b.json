  "description": "Does your inbox currently have zero unopened emails? Probably not, because an empty inbox in the 21st century is practically just a myth. These days, our email inboxes are flooded with just about everything. Work messages, spam, newsletters we swear we never signed up for, and promotional emails from companies whose websites we visited once—by accident—five years ago. And don't even get me started on the relentless wave of \"Final sale!\" reminders or the \"Are you still thinking about this item?\" guilt trips. Yes, I'm still thinking about it, but no, my bank account won't allow me to buy it. And no matter how many times you hit unsubscribe or move those messages to spam, they somehow always crawl back in. It's like fighting digital cockroaches. Renters, if you know, you know.But every once in a while, a revenge story like this comes along and you can't help but mentally fist pump for the underdog who put an end to his endless spam emails.",
