  "description": "Job interviews have the potential to make or break your job search. Sure, not getting to the next round of coffee chats and skill checks is a bummer. However, some particularly horrible interviews can break your spirit—and that, a job seeker cannot afford. You never realize how many strange, entitled individuals exist in the world until you venture out into the job market, bright-eyed and ready to prove yourself. Although, like the dirt on my favorite pair of ivory trainers, the grime of the job search can be wiped away once you realize what to look out for. Red flags are easy to recognize after you've had your hat in the ring for long enough. The employees in the thread below discuss the worst job interviews they've ever experienced—ones so bad they \"[ran] for the hills\". If you've had your fair share of strange, entitled interviewers, sound off in the comments. We'd love to read what other nonsensical behavior exists out there.",
