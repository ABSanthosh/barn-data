This trip, I mostly \"packed\" a bunch of PDFs. I used to pack so much shit for this trip. Once I packed an entire Kill Team setup (Oh!

The only problem is that they got these trees by the river, and I'm not allergic to any material on Earth except whatever these trees are putting out. People say it's pollen, but I'm not so sure. It's some kind of bioweapon. It invades the sinuses and roosts, sets up shop; my head audibly creaks as it expands. I have to hold on to shrubs and poles so I don't float into fucking space. I once packed a bluetooth keyboard, a monitor, a mouse, and a Steam Deck to work one year, but the problem is that the new site backend is so fucking good and works so well on mobile that it barely makes sense to. The thought/word ratio in this context is perfectly fine for thumbs to interpret, purely as a matter of psi. Alright!
