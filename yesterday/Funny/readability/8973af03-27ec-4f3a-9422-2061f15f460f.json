  "text": "Published: November 14, 2024 MINNEAPOLIS—Grabbing their pom-poms before heading out to pump up the crowd, several WNBA players confirmed Thursday that they have been forced to supplement their incomes during the offseason by cheerleading for NBA teams. “With the season over, everyone in the league is scrambling to make ends meet by getting a second job dancing for the NBA,” said Minnesota Lynx power forward Napheesa Collier, who earns $200 per game as a cheerleader for the Timberwolves. “We spend all day at regular practice, and then in the evenings we head straight to the arena in order to change into our crop tops and skirts and run through our dance routines before tipoff. I’m supposed to be using this time to rest my foot injury, but instead I’m shimmying around the court during the halftime show and shooting the T-shirt cannon into the crowd.
