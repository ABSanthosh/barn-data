  "text": "December 2, 2024 This week I’ll be leaving for Philadelphia and PAX Unplugged. This is one of my favorite shows and I’m super excited to be bringing my youngest son Noah with me this year. He’s obsessed with Warhammer 40k right now so I think a tabletop gaming expo will be a lot of fun.  I’ll be doing a couple different panels at the show. I’ll be playing in the Acquisitions Inc. Live game and I will also be doing the Make a Strip/PAX Birthday panel. If you would like to find me for a pin trade or an autograph, I’ll be using my Bluesky account to post my whereabouts during the show. In general though if you see me out and about please feel free to come up and say hi. I’ll have pins on me and I’m always happy to sign stuff.  I deleted my Twitter account months ago after it was clear that it had become a wretched hive of scum and villainy. As far as I can tell “Free Speech” for a lot of these people just means “I want to use slurs without repercussions”. As you can tell from today’s strip I have no desire to work for Ebon Tusk and that’s all I’d be doing on Twitter. They actively suppress any tweets with links so trying to use it to promote my stuff is a waste of time. My posts on Bluesky get more engagement with only a tiny fraction of the followers so that’s where you can find me now. You can also follow the official Penny Arcade account over there as well as the PAX account. I was looking around for some good Steam Deck games  to keep me busy on the flight and I discovered Windblown from the folks who made Dead Cells. It’s another killer Roguelike but this time they have added co-op play into the mix. I’m having a hard time putting it down and I haven’t even tried it in multiplayer yet. The action gameplay is rock solid and the music is fucking amazing. Don’t skip this one especially if you liked Dead Cells.  I’m also playing Wayfinder which recently got its 1.0 update. This is a wild story that I talked about a bit before. It was originally going to be a massive F2P online game with all the things that go along with that. After issues with their publisher though they had to rework the entire game and it is now a single player or co-op action RPG that you can play offline if you want. Personally I’m happy with the change. Now it plays much more like a Darksiders game and it runs decently on the Steam Deck. It’s worth checking out if you are in the mood for a hack and slash action RPG.  See you in Philly! -Gabe Out",
