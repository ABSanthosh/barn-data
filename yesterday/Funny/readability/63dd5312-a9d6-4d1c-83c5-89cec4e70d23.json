And we can provide: at 2pm PST, we will unleash a horde of our famous Double Secret boxes for the true pin enthusiast. Hunger for these boxes has historically been ravenous, so plan accordingly. I packed a ton of these myself, and there are some true delights to be had in this heady mix. Maintaining the pin theme, we have what might be my favorite project this year, and I wrote and released a novella. No: I speak, good folk, of the Friend Folio. Dabe's photograph that he made of the set (using cool Dwarven Forge stuff!) looks like a game which is not real but one I would like very much to play. Available as individual blind boxes or as a full case with extra jokes and art, you can get it however you want to get it right here and check out the rest of the shots. Our Dungeon Mistress line has recently received a potent addition that people have loved at the shows - and now, you may posess it. Behold the sacred raiment: The Dungeon Mistress Zip up Hoodie. There are two things to note. One, a harrowing full back design to inspire fear or reverence in your players - provided they are seated directly behind you: And two, our exclusive and eldritch Sleeve Crystals provide much-needed protection against Gaunts and Howlerinos: In this, its twentieth year, there are many who are taking the time to meditate upon PAX - even as they prepare for PAX Unplugged, which grows nigh! But there can be no more potent ritual focus than the 20 Years of PAX photobook, a true record of the show. As one of only two people who has been to every PAX, it's a little hard to get my head around. You may find yourself moved, also. If your urge to gamble has not been sated by our Blind Box options, fear not: We have Mystery Outerwear and Mystery Tee offerings that will allow you to roll the dice while also being styled by our design team. Consider them! Of course, there is a whole store there in addition, and I do have favorites. Our Nintendo Pinny Arcade collabs have something for everybody, focused on Animal Crossing, Mario, Zelda, and Splatoon. Dabe's \"Creature Feature\" tees and hoodies are, of course, immaculate and constitute an entire range just by themselves. You might enjoy my debut novella, \"Acquisitions Incorporated: Initiation\" in digital form, its companion Dranmagic version for the shippers, or perhaps both for a small savings.  Our Lexcalibur series of poetry books are better than they have any right to be, and I have no idea how we came to be affiliated with them.  They feel like something I found in the woods, and passed off as my own, which I guess isn't entirely untrue. Thanks for stopping by, and for those who are in the race for Double Secret boxes, we salute you. That said, the designers only know how to kick ass, I'm afraid. You cannot fill a cart from this store that isn't full of winners. (CW)TB",
