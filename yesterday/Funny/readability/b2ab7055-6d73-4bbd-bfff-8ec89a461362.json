  "description": "This person has been flaunting his new technological toy in all the wrong ways. Have you ever flown a drone before? Until a few years ago, these things weren't super common. However, they really took off in recent years (get it?!), and they became a household item for some technology lovers and video creators alike. Using the flying camera apparatus, you can take breathtaking footage from high in the air. Your device can soar across the sky, skim a lake, or check out a mountainous area with ease. All the while, the footage looks impressively smooth, like you're a director creating a movie of your own. Before you put a down payment on that drone, though, you may want to just search the phrase \"drone fails.\" You'll discover that there are many ways that a drone can be demolished, since they're both fragile and not waterproof. Some people fly too close to the surface of a lake to get pretty footage, only to watch as their drone splashes into the water, never to be seen again. Others fly too high and get their drones stuck in trees or on mountaintops. Then there are people like this dude, who let their drones interact with a dog.",
