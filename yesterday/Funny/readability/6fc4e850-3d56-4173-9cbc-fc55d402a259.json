  "description": "How many times have you heard a kitten crying outside and did nothing about it? It happens to all of us. Even the ones of us who go out of their way to help cats in need sometimes just… can't. People walk past cats in need all the time, but every once in a while, someone stops. Every once in a while, someone, perhaps like you or like us, rescues the cat and gives it a new chance at life. And the person who stops, the person who adopts the cat, that is the person who was meant to stop. That is the cat distribution system at work. And the system was working overtime on the day that this cat was rescued. Because no one was biting. No one was stopping. Countless people walked past this sickly-looking kitten that was just out there, in the middle of the street, waiting for someone to take notice. Finally, someone did, and we know, after seeing the video in full, that this home was the purrfect home for this kitten to end up in.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly.
