  "description": "You know what they say: \"The early bird gets the worm.\" But in this case, being early to work backfired on this lawyer. It's a tough job market out there, and you can lose a job for a number of reasons – layoffs, poor performance, absences and tardiness, and apparently, being early? In this instance, we have a lawyer who'd start work in the wee hours of the morning in order to finish at a decent hour and spend time with his wife and kid. He'd come in around 6:00 a.m. and finish his day at 5:00 p.m. The other lawyers would put in the same amount of hours but just at a later timeframe, starting around 8:00 a.m., going to the pub together at 5:00 p.m., and then working until 9:00 p.m. Despite consistently being the first one in the firm each day, the early bird was let go because, to his bosses, it looked like he was slacking. Among many red flags in the workplace, not valuing an employee's time and hard work is one of them. Is time even real, anyway? We live on a floating rock floating through space. How dare a man want to get out of work a little early to spend time with his wife and kid…",
