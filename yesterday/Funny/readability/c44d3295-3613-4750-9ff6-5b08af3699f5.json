  "description": "There is no worse human being than one who treats service industry staff like they are less than humans. Seriously, what is your problem? Where did all of that entitlement even come from?! Are you that stupid that you think you are so \"respected\" that the staff won't ruin your food or \"not be able to find\" your forgotten item you left at the table? Like, you don't even have the funds to be acting with that much entitlement. If you're going to treat the wait staff like you're better than them, then you have to at least tip 50%. Leaving a $2 tip on a tab that was over $100 is just absurd.  And yet, that is exactly what happened to this service industry employee. They were serving an absolutely swamped restaurant during a holiday weekend and, of course, they were understaffed. This one table waltzed in like they owned the place and quickly dug themselves into a grave after being disrespectful to the entire staff…",
