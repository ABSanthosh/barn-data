  "description": "When maintaining million-dollar machines is the singular focus of your work, you'd hope that your manager would leave well enough alone and trust you to know how to do your thing. Alas, when it comes to new management, leaving well enough alone is something that is never in the playbook, a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach taking precedence over logical reason.This machine operator worked at an aerospace manufacturing company, executing an efficient routine by starting work early to ensure that machines were calibrated and ready to begin production before the machinist's shift began. This, of course, made logical sense as having to run these procedures while everyone else was present would do nothing but hold up production. Management insisted that they follow a new schedule and stick to their scheduled hours,  causing the production line to grind to a halt while they completed calibration. The disruption and resulting losses eventually forced management's hand and allowed the operator to return to their old routine.",
