  "description": "Newborns are tiny, fragile, helpless things. Even leaving them lying in the wrong position, unable to reposition themselves, can be disastrous. Watching one, especially when you're inexperienced and not even an adult yourself, is understandably nerve-wracking.The brother's demand that his younger sister watch his newborn just because she offered to babysit at some point in the future is reminiscent of any other time you make an offer to do a favor for someone and they take the bounds of that favor way too far. Like offering to look after your friend's plants when they're away, and suddenly you're pet sitting and deep cleaning their house too. That moment of generosity was sorely regretted the entire time because the person just took it way too far. Surely she meant that she would watch her nephew at some point in the future, you know, when he was a toddler or something.Further, the obligation of parenting is just something you sign up for when you become a parent. The inconvenience of having to watch your child and miss things because of that is just a part of the deal, and you can't just take that out on your teenage sister because she's uncomfortable with your unreasonable request.",
