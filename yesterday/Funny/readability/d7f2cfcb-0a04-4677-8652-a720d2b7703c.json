  "description": "It's great to go out of your way to do things for others. I'd argue it's even an often-overlooked societal obligation to look out for other people. But when going out of your way becomes a base-level expectation, even a demand, rather than something that's appreciated and willingly given. This begs the question of how far and for how long you should be willing to go for other people and—well… how long is a piece of string?When this 20-year-old college student found out that her 19-year-old cousin drives to her university classes rather than taking public transport or other means, she probably started thinking about how unfair it was that she didn't have her own way of driving to classes. So, of course, she probably told her mother (the other girl's aunt), who began demanding that the younger girl drive her to her classes.Outside of the fact that they don't even go to the same school, there are a myriad of reasons why this wouldn't work out. Colleges don't really tend to have a start and end time, and it's really just what your schedule is for that given quarter that determines when you go to class and when you leave. But that didn't stop the extended family from getting involved when the younger girl refused to drive her cousin, throwing around accusations of selfishness and spoiledness.",
