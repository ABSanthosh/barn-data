  "description": "Cats have unique ways of showing affection to their humans. Not every cat will cuddle with their human or sleep next to them in bed, but they all show their love and appreciation. You just have to understand their love language. One of the ways that cats show love is by bringing things to us. Usually, it's something small, maybe a bug that they caught or a hair tie they found. But sometimes, they things they bring are special and sweet, like the cat who brings leaves to his human. Other times, the things they bring are hilarious. Like the cat who steals undies from his neighbors then brings them to their human, or the cat who brings his owner just about anything, from fireworks, darts and pieces of wood and a cat toy that it stole from some other cat. It's an expression of love. Accept it. The cat in this video chose to bring its human just about the cutest thing that she pawssibly could have. Flowers - Camellias specifically. And she brought them consistently, covering the bed and the floors with them. She kept bringing them until her chosen human adopted her. And then… she gave that human another gift.",
