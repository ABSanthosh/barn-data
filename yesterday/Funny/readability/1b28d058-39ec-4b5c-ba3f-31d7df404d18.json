  "description": "Oh, cat pawrents. It was a difficult mission to catch your attention. But we understand, obviously, as cat pawrents ourselves. All we want to see, hear, smell, and give attention to - is our cat. We want to pet our cat all day, we want to hear the cat's soft purrs, we want to cuddle this floofy creature. So, yeah, it was difficult to get you all the way here, and away from your cat for a second. But your cat's asleep, so you can be for a second a general feline fanatic fan and not just of your cat.It's not like you're leaving your cat - your cat is probably still on your lap, or literally by your side. You can enjoy some cat comedy while you wait for your cat to wake up from their 16-hour nap. It's okay. We got you covered. There are plenty of comical cat memes to fill this feline time with. All you need to do is to scroll down for them.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",
