  "description": "There comes a point in every relationship when you start to form your own language that anyone outside of the relationship would find, frankly, insane. Maybe it's the voice you speak to each other with. Maybe it's the pet names you call each other. Maybe it's the inside jokes you share that you wouldn't be able to explain to anyone if you tried. This stage, however strange, strengthens the relationship and forms a remarkable bond between you and your partner that you won't be able to replicate with anyone else.intelligence Some couples' language is to tease each other relentlessly, and from an outside perspective, it can seem mean-spirited. For some couples, this works. To each their own, you know. But there comes a time when you know that this stage has ended when the jokes you make about each other start to get old. One man came to the internet to talk about the jokes his girlfriend makes about him and how it escalated to the point where his coworkers started to call her out on it. So, do you think it was in their right to say something? Or is this another thing that only the couple would understand?",
