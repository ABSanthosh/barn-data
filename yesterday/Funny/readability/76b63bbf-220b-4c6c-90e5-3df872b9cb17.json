These boys had made a video about how important D\u0026D was to their family during their brother's illness and how they are now raising money for The Leukemia \u0026 Lymphoma Society. It was a pleasure to get to meet Dash, Axel and their parents. Jerry and I were both very impressed with these boys and I told Dash I would share a link to their fundraising page here on Penny Arcade.  I’ll leave their video here for you to watch and the link to their fundraising page.  I wish the best for Dash, Axel and their family and I hope D\u0026D continues to bring them all together. -Gabe Out",
