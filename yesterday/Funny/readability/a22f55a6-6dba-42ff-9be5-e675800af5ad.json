  "text": "The button marked ‘sure thing’ can just be so much more inviting than the ‘originality’ one As the people who pull the purse strings become increasingly intolerant of any level of risk, sequels have become a fact of life. It might not be what you imagine when you sit down to write the next great American novel, but the button marked “sure thing” can just be so much more inviting than the “originality” one.That must be how we ended up getting further installments of… 5 The Devil Wears Prada Don't Miss Ten years after releasing the book that turned Meryl Streep into one of cinema’s greatest villains, Lauren Weisberger published Revenge Wears Prada, which follows protagonist Andy Sachs as she struggles with “the trials of ‘having it all,’” meaning her own bridal magazine that she runs with Emily, the real hero of the franchise, and a rich fiance with a snobby mother. Note that the upcoming movie sequel follows a very different and much more Streep-focused plot, because they know what audiences actually want. If nothing else, rejoice: Andy broke up with Nate. 4 Watership Down The 1978 film adaptation of Richard Adams’ novel is mostly remembered for being thoroughly traumatizing, a reaction he apparently took to mean “please give us a Tolkien-esque deep dive into the mythology of these murder bunnies.” The resulting Tales from Watership Down, published in 1996, consists of 19 short stories, five of which detail the life of the historical rabbit prince El-ahrairah, another four recount his visit to the Black Rabbit of Inlé, aaaaand you’ve already switched tabs. 3 The Jungle Book The funniest thing about The Second Jungle Book is its name, though in fairness to Rudyard Kipling, he didn’t know that’s how they would name the Sharknado sequels. It’s an accurate title, too, though only five of its stories are related to Mowgli. Fun fact: The 1994 live-action Jungle Book adaptation was mostly based on this book, which is probably why you found it so confusing. 2 Paradise Lost Okay, so Paradise Lost and subsequently Regained are technically poems, and again, the title is definitely the funniest part about Paradise Regained. Like, leaving paradise was kind of a huge deal in the first one. And then they just immediately got it back? Okay, maybe not “they,” exactly, as Paradise Regained moves on from Adam and Eve to the temptation of Jesus. Still. Don’t act like you didn’t laugh. 1 The Hundred and One Dalmatians If you picked up The Starlight Barking, the 1967 sequel to 1956’s The Hundred and One Dalmatians, expecting more lighthearted adventures of foiling an avant garde dog murderer, you’d have been in for a real surprise. The world of the Darlings has become a sci-fi dreamland, somewhat literally, as every creature who isn’t a dog has fallen into an eternal slumber. The dogs get superpowers. Cadpig is prime minister. No part of that is a joke. Honestly, this one sounds sick as hell. Disney, you know what to do. Scroll down for the next article Must Read SIGN UP FORA WEEKLYNEWSLETTER OF JOKES + TRIVIA",
