  "description": "Let's check in with the DIYers of the world and see how that's going. Oh it's… it's going off the rails? Cool, great! We'll be the judge of thees home remodeling disasterpieces. A lot of people do DIY projects to save money, but they end up making mistakes that cost them even more money to fix. For example, some people will try to tile their own floors or counters. During the early 2020s when we all spent a lot of time at home, this was quite common: people were spending lots of time in the home, bored to tears, so they figured they may as well try their hand at a DIY project. One dad here tried to build a couch out of what appear to be car seats. Another person decided to put recycled crushed cans on the outside of their home! That's not going to insulate your house better than siding would, and it's quite the eyesore at the same time. Some projects are better left to the professionals, as you'll see from the DIY disasters down below. After that, read about the boss who was infuriated that his employee \"quit without thinking twice\" after being offered a huge raise.",
