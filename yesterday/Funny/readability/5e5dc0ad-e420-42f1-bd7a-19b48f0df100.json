  "text": "I never crossed paths with the Stop Killing Games petition until somebody tried to make the case that it was bad. That strike me as quite bold, but as this person is currently in the process of being dismantled by the Internet equivalent of wild dogs I won't pile on anymore than is absolutely required. I get very sweaty and shaky whenever these weapons are deployed, I abhor their use, but man. Way to literally die on a hill, I guess. I mentioned it before, about one of the Tiger Woods golf games, but we had gotten a copy of it for Gabe's dad because we thought it might be an opportunity to do something we all liked at the same time. In that era, and maybe now too but I wouldn't know because I stopped buying their shit, it was simply the case that the games didn't work online at first. You would buy it, and put it on, and choose items from menus and then it didn't do them. Mork and I were like, aw, man. His dad was like, what do you mean the thing you bought didn't work? You bought it. They got your money. This game eventually worked, and you still had it! What our modern Digitality enables in terms of retroactive property destruction is even more bizarre. This kind of stuff is inconceivable to normal people, and what SKG is talking about won't be conceivable to the judges who would preside over such a case. What we've been conditioned to believe is normal simply isn't. The purpose of the campaign is to give you what you already own. It's a bizarre state of affairs. (CW)TB out.",
