  "description": "Hey there, cat pawrents. If you've ever adopted a kitten, you know that they are both fluffy, sweet little angels, and also purrfessional life-destroyers at the same time. One second, they're snuggled up on your chest, snoozing away, and then a few hours later (specifically at night), they're running around your house breaking literally everything pawssible. It's a lot. And the energy is never ending. This is why we always tell people to do their research before adopting a kitten, and even then it can't fully prepaw you for the chaos that will come.The only way out is through, so you just have to live through it and know that it will get better. Now, some kittens are easier than others. The really hard ones make you question your reality, and even force you to consider rehoming your tiny baby. After being sleep deprived for the last couple of months, one such feline pawrent was at their limit. They asked the internet for advice, and what they received was not quite what they expected. Scroll down to see how they solved it below!",
