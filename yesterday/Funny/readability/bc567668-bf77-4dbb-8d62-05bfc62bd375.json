  "description": "Cats live pretty secretive lives on the whole. Whether it is the inner world of an indoor cat, or the wide world that outdoor cats roam, patrol and pawrty in, they have large parts of their lives that we rarely get to see, let alone be a part of.And seeing as feline pawrents and fanatics alike cannot get enough of the sweet and simple things our feline friends do everyday, we figured you would probably leap at the opportunity to delve deeper like a cat who found out their food bowl had a false bottom and that they could actually fit their whole body in the full bowl. So find yourself a cozy space to curl up in like an indoor cat would when entering their rich inner world and prepaw yourself for your fabulous feline funnies.",

But imagine what it would be like to look out upon all that splendor without understanding, it would be beyond comprehension. This image depicts the moment that Scrungus the great emerged from his cave. It had been rumored for years that this great leader of cats had been taken by canine kind, or that he was on holiday in Japan on an island just for cats. But now we know, he has been waiting for the right moment to emerge and renter the world.",
