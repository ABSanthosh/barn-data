Now it’s becoming increasingly clear that without military intervention, our kegs will run dry before the night even begins. The last thing this nation needs is to be left with nothing but tequila. That shit gives me such a fucking hangover.” According to sources, Hegseth also ordered the military to buy several thousand bottles of Smirnoff for some chicks he had been texting.
