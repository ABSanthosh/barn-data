  "text": "Maher gave the finger to critics of age-gap relationships while flaunting his confirmed bachelorhood New rule: No one is allowed to tweet that a smarmy 68-year-old centrist bragging about bedding a twenty-something comes off as gross and embarrassing to anyone who isn’t also a smarmy 68-year-old centrist.It’s not exactly a new phenomenon that older men who have enjoyed decades of sustained success in the entertainment industry naturally attract much younger, much better-looking women with their shining personalities and encyclopedic knowledge of the 1969 New York Mets. For whatever reason, attractive young women with their own aspirations in show business find cranky, gray-haired moguls who once entertained their fathers to be sexually irresistible. However, in recent years, the complicated gender politics of “age gap” relationships have increased social media scrutiny on such romances. But the arcane laws of attraction that Cupid uses to bring old rich men and young hot women together are nobody’s business besides that of the two consenting adults within the relationship and the hundreds of thousands of HBO viewers to whom the silver fox brags about his sexual conquests.In a recent conversation with Michael and Lauryn Bosstick of The Skinny Confidential Podcast, Real Time host Bill Maher fiercely defended his many flings with women who are many decades younger than himself, saying, “The people who are pissed off at that, fuck you.” Don't Miss I guess that’s one way to introduce yourself to your girlfriend’s parents. During the talk, Maher told the Bossticks that he believes that the many young women with whom he’s often seen in the tabloids are attracted to his “unavailability” — his estimated $140 million net worth must be an added bonus. The currently single and notorious bachelor also claimed that these young women seek him out, not the other way around. “I’m not looking. I’m good,” he said of his current relationship status.“Nothing that I could have predicted when I was your age came to pass,” Maher told 38-year-old Lauryn. “Like I would never have imagined that at this age, anyone — and again, like I’ll say this just generally — my dating is not age-appropriate.”Michael then asked the HBO star if Maher would say that his choice in female companionship can be \"perceived in an unorthodox context, younger than what you should be dating.”“Not just perceived, they literally are,” Maher plainly replied. “You do you, I do me. You do what works for you,” Maher said of his philosophy on love.When the topic of marriage arose, Maher told his matrimonially linked friends, “I don’t believe in it. It’s not Hinduism, there’s no belief in it. It would ruin everything. I mean, I’m not going to. I love to talk about this subject, but it’s tough because I also don’t really ever want to divulge the details of my own personal life.” However, Maher later backtracked, “It’s not that I don’t believe in marriage or acknowledge that some people do have good marriages. I know people who would be lost without this.”After all, if men and women stopped getting married and having babies, Maher would run out of new girlfriends.
