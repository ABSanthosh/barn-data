  "description": "I'm curious to know: is it okay to buy flowers for your ex (and mother of your child) on Valentine's Day? This poor person did exactly that, but their new GF is upset about it, and they're receiving mixed advice about the situation. Parents who remain friendly after a divorce are doing their best for the kids. It's in the children's best interest to see their parents getting along amicably instead of squabbling all the time. But it can also be tricky for parents to navigate the new family dynamics. There are bound to be awkward moments as the parents move forward with their lives and start fresh relationships. This parent found that out first hand on Valentine's Day, after a gesture of goodwill threw his new girlfriend for a loop.Although this dude seems to have had good intentions, he just didn't really think through the consequences of what he was doing. As commenters lightly scolded them, it was a good reminder to prioritize the new GF, instead of focusing on the past. The parent has a big heart, and next Valentine's Day, I bet they'll get everything right for all three women in their life: daughter, girlfriend, and ex/child's mother. Next, check out some of these unbelievable baking mistakes fresh from the oven, like one person who admitted, \"We call this the 'cookie soup' incident.\"",
