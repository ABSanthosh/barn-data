They're giving this shit away! They're giving this shit away. I basically think that \"soulslikes\" ours \"souls-likes\" or whatever the fuck are constructed from a very simple set of materials - it's King's Field plus Monster Hunter. It's at its most naked form in Bloodborne, the switch weapons kinda give it away. But the undiluted hooch form of Monster Hunter is an experience where every weapon is like a completely other game. I've mentioned it before: any weapon you might choose would have been an entire game worth of content in the two-thousands. That would be the whole hook, unfolding each one's weird idiosyncrasies. There's also a game where you make equipment of various kinds out of a monster's most precious bones. Here, they just put all this stuff in the same box. Because hitting things feels so good in this game, hitting a Goddamn dragon right on the head with a giant fucking cello, like they get hit so hard they go to sleep, I've avoided ranged weapons in the game altogether. I don't think I could name another game that understands and realizes weight like this. This year I've been actively trying to divest from how I would usually play, though: taking on Tank and DPS roles in Rivals is a completely new thing. Monster Hunter gave me a weapon called a Hunting Horn that lets you beat the shit out of a huge frog while also playing rousing tunes for your allies. But I think this time around I'm gonna go with son of a bitch: It's essentially a gun that is a melee weapon. That seems Monster Hunter as shit. (CW)TB",
