  "description": "Doing human resources work isn't always serious. Sometimes, it can be very funny, as the people of the internet will tell you!  Though they're sometimes known as the company boogeyman, the human resources department is sometimes needed to step in and sort out employee relations. They have a broad range of job duties, from managing an office to hiring and firing to mediating employee disputes. This can result in some awkwardness at times. As these HR professionals can tell you, it can be very awkward to try and figure out which employee is the one stinking up the office with their BO or talking to an employee about wearing appropriate office attire. Still, these HR professionals managed to make the best out of their situations. U/sgy0003 asked people to share the \"most ridiculous/hilarious complaints you ever received,\" and more than 2,700 people replied with their funniest tales. One person had to deal with an executive assistant who claimed her high heels prevented her from walking to the copier. Another got in trouble for their drawing of a stingray! You can check out all of these very silly tales down below. Up next, read about what happened when this 15-year-old called out her Grandmother for constantly missing her school concerts, leaving the whole family reeling.",
