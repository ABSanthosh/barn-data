  "description": "We have one question and one question only, feline fam: do you want to go in or out? You can't do both, so you must decide. And no, meowing at the door is not an answer. But, if you choose to become an outdoor cat, we must warn you that A) it is cold outside and B) it is not as nice as inside. But, the choice is still yours to make. Do you want to be an indoor cat or an outdoor one today? We always prefurr to be an indoor cat, the less hoomans we see on the daily the better. But, we know that it's good to get out and breathe some fresh air, so today, we will venture into the great outdoors. But we will immediately claw at the door to come back in, because one breath seems good enough for today. Just like these hissterical cat memes that are meowing to come back in after being outside for exactly 0.3 seconds. They also appreciate the comfort of being at home, just like us. Happy scrolling!",
