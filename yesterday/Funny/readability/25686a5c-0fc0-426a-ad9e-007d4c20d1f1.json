The aisles are full, check-out lines are long, and have of the things on your list are sold out. It's frustrating and overwhelming. So you try to stay focused, bring a shopping list, and go on your own or with one other partner to help out—any more and it becomes extra stressful.  No imagine you go during shopping rush hour and you decide to bring you partner, kids, in-laws, cousins, and kids' friends. What?… Why?? Why would you do that? What is the point?? All that is going to do is cause extra stress for you, because now you are a host/babysitter, and you are just adding even more to the shopping rush hour that makes shoppers so overwhelmed.
