  "description": "If the boss wants to be wrong, let him! He pays you to come to your job and try your best. As long as you're doing that, plus covering yourself with a paper trail, you should be fine to watch as his mistakes ruin his day. Managers will talk about hiring employees they can count on, then turn around and micromanage them. It's pretty self-defeating, but that doesn't stop bosses from breathing down their employees' necks for no reason at all. This person, u/Stumpy6464, had to watch as their boss made a mistake, and no matter how much this employee tried to warn them, the boss just kept referencing policy. At least this employee now has a great story of malicious compliance to share. Commenters loved their story, and added that the boss was really to blame here at the end of the day. One person noted that they especially needed a better system to ensure events like this wouldn't happen in the future, since it is wasteful to let so much product get ruined for no reason other than maliciously complying. Up next, have a laugh at some really funny costume mistakes, like one person who was exasperated to find that their \"Halloween costume came and the gloves only have 4 fingers.\"",
