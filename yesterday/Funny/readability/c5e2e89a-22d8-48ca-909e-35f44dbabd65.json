  "description": "You won't find many people who would argue with you for wanting a child-free wedding—except, of course, those parents who think their little darlings are the exception to any and every rule. It can get a little harder to sell this idea, however, when you try and pass the \"child-free\" rule for one specific individual: your \"bad apple\" 9-year-old cousin. Let's consider here that in most cases, for a kid that young, the problem is actually the parents themselves… regardless of what \"attempts\" they might be making to fix the behavior.However, this bride is considering doing exactly this, wanting to exclude her problematic 9-year-old cousin from her wedding due to his exceptionally bad behavior and flair for inappropriate language. Distressed by the decision facing her and wanting all of her better-behaved younger cousins to attend, she turned to this online community to seek advice as to whether or not she should proceed with the targeted exclusion. Commenters on the thread shared lots of helpful advice and largely sided with her and her decision to exclude the single problematic child.",
