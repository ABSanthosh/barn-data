  "description": "Cats make everything better. Every cat owner knows that. They make every moment of life more exciting and amazing. Some people would think that cats stealing food off our plates right under our noses, or cats yelling at closed doors every time we go to the bathroom, or cats sitting directly on our puzzles without any care or concern for the pieces they're obscuring… is inconvenient. But we, cat owners, see it for what it is. Entertainment. We know that life would be so much more boring without them. And so, since cats make everything so much better, it only makes sense that if you're trying to sell a second-hand item, you would… sneak your cat into the photo. Hey, you may think it's silly, but after looking at there ads, we've come to the conclusion that we're pretty sure that this would work on us. The cats are pretty much guaranteed to distract us from anything that might be wrong with whatever is being sold in there.",
