  "description": "This group of employees wasn't sure how to handle the workplace weirdo… because he doesn't technically work with them. This person wrote in for advice using a throwaway account called u/throwRA-nonSeq. They shared that they work in an office complex with a bunch of different businesses, and there's one dude who's being an utter creep. He's being just annoying enough to really weird out the other employees, especially the women, who he seems to target in particular. But, as is often the case with workplace issues, these workers didn't know if it was \"bad enough\" to report to HR. And the other issue is that they didn't even know where this dude worked, so they didn't know if HR could even take up their case. However, sometimes HR works exactly as it's supposed to. As you can read about in the original story and the following two updates, HR worked fast to get rid of this dude. It's never acceptable to intimidate those you work with, and the quicker you call out the bad behavior, the safer and happier everyone else in the office will be. Up next, read the stories of employees who left their bad bosses behind to find better jobs, like one person who resigned with their entire team!",
