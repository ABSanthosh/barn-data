  "description": "These clueless customers just couldn't understand how they were calling the wrong number. Taking phone calls can really eat up your work day. It depends on your profession, but in some workplaces, a single call can take an hour or two per day. Whether you're assisting clients, talking to customers with urgent issues, or relaying an update to your boss, all that yapping is going to eat up your free time. Instead of doing your actual work, you find yourself dreaming about the moment you can press that \"end call\" button.No one knows that better than this person, who suddenly found themself doing nothing else but phone calls. Instead of making a couple calls, scribbling out a few emails, and then spending time on actual work, this person quite literally was stuck on the phone all day. Thanks to a mistake, they couldn't do anything else on their phone, due to getting constant calls. At least they got back at this company! These customers aren't going to renting chalets from that place any time soon. After that, read about these managers who got stuck with some awful employees and shared their stories, like one boss who shared that an employee \"thought it was perfectly okay to just take a nap.\"",
