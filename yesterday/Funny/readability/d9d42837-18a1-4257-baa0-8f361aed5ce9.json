  "description": "One of the beautiful things about the cat distribution system - which is totally real and is working hard each and every day - is that it can catch you anywhere. You could be going on a hike when a kitten jumps out at you out of nowhere and forces you to adopt it. You could be having a regular day, chilling at home, when a cat randomly walks into your house. You could be having a midnight picnic and get adopted by a cat out of absolutely nowhere. That's the thing - once you get chosen, there is no going back from it. Once a cat chooses to adopt a human, the world will provide it with a good human to adopt. \"The world\". We mean the cat distribution system. It's the only thing that can explain stories like this - a man simply going to work, a kitten coming out of nowhere, essentially demanding to be adopted and… that's right, getting adopted right then and there. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.
