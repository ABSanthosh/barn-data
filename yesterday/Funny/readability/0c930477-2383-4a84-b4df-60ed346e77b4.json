  "text": "Published: February 17, 2025 SEATTLE—Voicing concern about the adult’s aberrant behavior, sources confirmed Monday that it was almost weirder that Richard Shea, a grown man on Roblox, wasn’t using the online gaming platform to groom children. “If he was on here trying to find underage players and lure them into some sort of sexual relationship, that would be super fucked-up, but at least it would explain his reasons for spending hours each day playing virtual experiences designed by children. This guy isn’t a predator, though,” said Roblox player Mason Briggs, 11, telling reporters that the fact that there was no sinister sexual motivation behind Shea’s dogged pursuit of high scores on games such as Blox Fruits and BedWars and that he seemed to play only for fun was bizarre and inexplicable. “I remember he invited me and a few friends to an in-game party where we could all play and communicate together. He never pressured us to reveal contact information or made any sort of inappropriate or explicit remark. He mostly just wanted tips on how to make it through the Ancient Ruins map on Adopt Me! It kind of gave me the creeps.” At press time, Briggs was reportedly all the more disturbed after receiving a private message from Shea informing her that he’d have even more time to play now that he had received tenure.
