  "description": "Ahhhh, Sundays. The third best day of the week, but certainly the most relaxing. Caturdays are the best day of the week (obviously), followed by Furidays, and Sundays come safely in third. Sundays are the only day of the week when we can expurrience what it's like to be a cat for a little bit and nap without consequence. Sure, we can't take 17 naps on Sundays, but one or two won't hurt us because we have nothing else to do.One of the things we love the most is when our cats purrfect full shrimp-mode when they sleep. We love seeing their little feetsies stick out and their content, sleepy faces as they dream about catching mice or rolling in catnip. It's so cute, in fact, that we could scroll through a whole listicle of cats in shrimp-mode… hey, that's a great idea! Good thing we're so smart because we've already gathered all these cats into a seafood special for you to enjoy below. Happy Sunday - we hope it's purrfectly restful and full of feline shrimp.",
