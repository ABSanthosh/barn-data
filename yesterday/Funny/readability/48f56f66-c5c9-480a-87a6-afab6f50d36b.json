Definitely a long walk.   \"TDSTF\", reports regular Michael R. from London, well distant from Toledo OH and Toledo ES.   Also on the bus, astounded Ivan muses \"It's been a long while since I've seen a computer embedded in a piece of public infrastructure (here: a bus payment terminal) literally snow crash. They are usually better at listening to Reason...\"   From Warsaw, Jaroslaw time travels twice. First with this entry \"Busses at the bus terminus often display time left till departure, on the front display and on the screens inside. So one day I entered the bus - front display stating \"Departure in 5 minutes\". Inside I saw this (upper image)... After two minutes the numbers changed to the ones on the lower image. I'm pretty sure I was not sitting there for six hours...\"   And again with an entry we dug out of the way back bin while I was looking for more bus-related items. Was it a total concidence this bus bit also came from Jaroslaw? who just wanted to know \"Is bus sharing virtualised that much?\" I won't apologize, any kind of bus will do when we're searching hard to match a theme.   [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds.
