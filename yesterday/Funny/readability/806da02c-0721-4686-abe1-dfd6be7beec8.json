  "description": "Who doesn't love coming up with creative ways to avoid doing any real work? You walk around the office and try to come up with meaningless tasks that would keep you busy and allow you to forget about your real responsibility. You help a coworker fix to copy machine, ask HR if they need help setting up the office Happy Hour, and reorganize your desk drawer for the 100th time. Everything to look busy but not do any real work.For every 5 employees who pull stunts like this, there might be one who would actually go out of their way to help with those little tasks. They don't do it because they don't want to work; they do it because they really do want to help, and to make the office a better place to work in. To prove that their goal is not to waste working hours, they might even do it while they are off the clock, just like the employee in the story below.",
