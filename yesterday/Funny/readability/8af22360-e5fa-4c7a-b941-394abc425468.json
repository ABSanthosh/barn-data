  "description": "Dealing with parents as a teen is difficult, but navigating those relationships in the midst of divorce and infidelity presents even more of a challenge. While the ex-husband's new wife has been in this teen's life for 6 years or so, things are undoubly complex due to the nature of how they got together, and that length of time doesn't automatically mean that there's any closeness between them. It doesn't seem out of the question here that the ex-husband's new wife simply wants to seize her moment to solidify her \"place\" in her stepdaughter's life.At the end of the day, it's the daughter's event and a celebration of her and her parents' achievements. If she doesn't want someone involved in those celebrations, well, that's sort of up to her. Of course, there will be situations where the parents need to steer their kids onto the right course, but this isn't necessarily one of those times. Especially since the mother seems to be the primary caretaker here, it definitely falls to her to protect her daughter's wishes.",
