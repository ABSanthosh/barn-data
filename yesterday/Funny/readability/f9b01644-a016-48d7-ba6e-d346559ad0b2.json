  "description": "One of the beautiful things about being adopted by a cat is that you never know when or where it is going to happen to you. You might get adopted by a kitten on a hike, when you go out for that mental health walk that everyone talks about. Or you might get adopted by a kitten who just… shows up one day and sits on driveway, ready to rule your entire home before you even know it's coming. Or… maybe you're like this couple, and the most important day of your life also turns out to be the most impurrtant day of your future kitten's life.Not only did this kitten crash this couple's wedding, but she did it straight in the middle of the ceremony, forcing them to stop it and pay attention to her. Because the Cat Distribution System doesn't ask when to give you a cat, it just does it, and you… are just blessed by it.",
