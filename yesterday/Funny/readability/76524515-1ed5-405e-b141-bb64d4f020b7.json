  "description": "These hotel receptionists were giving guests the side-eye. Not everyone can act normal out in public, and these people are proof of that! Front desk workers do much more than just check-in guests. Many of them work long hours and supervise other workers and guests as well. If a guest needs a towel or a toothbrush, they're the one to provide it. Some guests will show up without a reservation and make it the receptionist's problem to solve. They're flipping out because they have a reservation in someone else's name or they just plain forgot, and the front desk worker will have to try and solve the problem for them. Other guests go through the check-in process just fine, but once they're comfy in their room, they start acting out. You can't just smoke out a hotel room just because you feel like it, or damage the room and expect workers to turn a blind eye to it. Read about the day-to-day life of a hotel receptionist down below and discover all the crazy shenanigans these guests have gotten into. After that, if you're having a bad day, you'll feel much better after reading about some folks who are having a worse one, like one person who discovered that someone snapped a side mirror off their car and just left it there.",
