  "description": "Howdy there, feline fam. One of the things we love doing most as a cat pawrent is taking silly pictures of our cats. We love taking pictures of them when they are in full airplane mode, when they fall asleep in purrfectly silly pawsitions, those ameowzing up-close-and-purrsonal angles, and especially the outrageously silly 0.5x zoom pics. They're already so cute and funny-looking that any pawpportunity we have to make them look even sillier, we take it without hesitation.One genius cat owner took this topic to the next level - by adding a secret camera to their cat's food bowl and to catch their nomming up close. Let us just sayâ€¦we're really mad we didn't think about this first. These pictures are the literal definition of purrfection. Ladies, gentlemen, and friends of the feline-variety, you are witnessing the birth of a new meme. Take a second to soak it in (and laugh at how hissterical these cat pictures are). Scroll down to enjoy more of this hilarious POV and some of the comedic comments below. Enjoy!",
