  "description": "A homegrown business venture can be a great way for one to separate true friends from freeloaders with sticky fingers and grand designs on charity. Our snack mogul starts off with the simple dream of slinging homemade ice cream and drinks to a grateful populace, only to discover that friendship and capitalism mix about as well as pickles and vanilla. The first week brings riches and camaraderie; the second week, a coup led by a ragtag band of opportunists with big appetites and even bigger ideas about profit-sharing, none of which include the person actually supplying the inventory.",

Friends turn into rivals with the nutritional habits of raccoons and the ethics to match, treating the original entrepreneur like a guest at their own party. When polite confrontation gets ignored and the bottom line drops into the red, our business owner takes decisive action: pack up the operation, wave goodbye to the leeches, and reclaim every last frozen treat. The soundtrack to this move is a chorus of pleas from suddenly desperate ex-friends who prefer their good deeds funded by someone else’s debt.",
