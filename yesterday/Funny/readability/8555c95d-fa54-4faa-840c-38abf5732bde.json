  "description": "Coming back to Seattle from Philadelphia, you have a couple options when travelling by sky-bullet. One of them has you leaving at 6:20 in the evening, and the other - the one less travelled by - leaves in the crisp light of a new star, at the very moment the world was born. That is to say, 7:14am, which necessitates waking up at a ghastly juncture prior to causality itself. I was originally configured for the more humane option, but descended into madness and swapped. Then the machine in the security line detected some kind of pantal anomaly and we all laughed our asses off for a while.",

One of them has you leaving at 6:20 in the evening, and the other - the one less travelled by - leaves in the crisp light of a new star, at the very moment the world was born.

Then the machine in the security line detected some kind of pantal anomaly and we all laughed our asses off for a while. Gabriel has drawn it in the strip exactly as we saw it, and even complete strangers had an opportunity to wonder and be mystified at this festive inversion of the Rudolph tale. To my mind, it was something like the weak point one might use to dominate a giant enemy crab. This is only reinforced by the fact that - were we to target that area repeatedly, with a barrage of full force strikes - I doubt he could long endure. It was an index of the quality on the drawstrings on our PAX Joggers, perhaps - density you can feel, density you can rely upon. It's a stern drawstring and the machine was stymied by it, broken. Oh, by the way. I didn't know this: so, that machine with the big vertical wand that swings by you isn't a metal detector. It's something else, I don't know exactly what it is. All I know is that it essentially creates a picture of you for them to look at that I think I'm comfortable describing as horrifying. It's a picture of you as a cadaver, or a naked ghost. Do not recommend looking! They must have to change these people out like light bulbs. The PAX Unplugged Show Store is still available, but only for a short time - these items ship when the truck gets back from PAX, so probably not a holiday item exactly, but I know that the purple colorway is prized among the faithful and I want you to get your mitts on it if you can.
