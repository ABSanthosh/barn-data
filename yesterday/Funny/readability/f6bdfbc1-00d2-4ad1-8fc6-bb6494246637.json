  "description": "Let this story serve as yet another friendly reminder to never trust your landlord. This does not merely apply to private residents, as this time, we're dealing with the property of a leisure business. During a difficult economic period for the business, the landlord proved ruthless and issued a 7-day eviction notice with the expectation that the employees would be unable to clear out all their equipment on such short notice. It gets worse. After a little probing, the business owners discovered that their landlord was advertising their soon-to-be former property with all of their technological equipment included in the hopes of making a profit. The assumption here was that the business owners would be unable to get all of their company property cleared from the building in time. Well, as we all know, there is nothing like doubt and suspicion from others to motivate folks to prove the haters wrong. In this case, that hater would be the landlord, who would come to regret issuing the eviction notice in the first place.
