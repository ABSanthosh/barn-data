  "description": "Always leave 'em wanting more! This applies in many areas of life, and for this person, watching their boss scramble as they walked out the door was just the icing on the cake. Having an ungrateful boss can make your day job utterly miserable. Instead of thanking you for working hard (and probably working outside of work hours, too!), some bosses just want more and more out of their employees. You'll never get a thank you from them. Instead of thanking you for working late last Friday, they'll say something like \"The client wasn't happy with that latest email,\" or \"You missed a phone call from this person, you need to do better.\" All of this can really wear someone down over time! You start daydreaming about how quickly the workplace would collapse without you. You imagine your boss taking on all of your projects, fumbling through your files, and hastily searching through your emails trying to do all of the work you usually do for them. This person was tired of that kind of environment, so they planned the perfect exit, as you can check out below.",
