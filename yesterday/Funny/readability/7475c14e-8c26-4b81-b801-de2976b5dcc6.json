  "description": "Hey there, fellow feline enthusiasts. One thing all cat lovers understand is that cats are the ones who choose us. Not the other way around. And when they do, it feels like a little piece of everyday magic. That is exactly what happened to the original poster, a kindhearted couple who had been quietly watching a cautious calico drift in and out of their yard for months. She was beautiful, independent, and never let anyone get too close. They named her Cleo and assumed she would always be just a passing visitor.But one quiet morning, everything changed. Cleo was curled up fast asleep on their back porch. Tired and clearly hungry, she let OP approach her with food and gentle care. She ate like she had not had a proper meal in days. And then she came back. Again and again. What started as cautious visits turned into naps on their patio furniture, mealtime meetups, and eventually, full cuddles and trust. Bringing a stray into your home is not always easy. It takes patience, respect, and an understanding that trust is earned slowly. OP gave Cleo all the time and space she needed. They never pushed. They simply waited. And in doing so, they let her decide what she needed most.",

  "text": "MORE INFO FROM OP:This cat, who we have named Cleo, has been roaming our yard and the woods behind us for at least two months now. I could never get close to her, and she was really standoffish, but this morning I found her asleep on our back porch. I didn't even see her until she bolted off the couch and ran into our garden. I got her to come out with some treats and food, and the poor baby must have been starving. She ate two cans of tuna, two cans of our current orange’s wet food, and was still hungry.When we left today for dinner, she was gone, but when we came home, she was back on our porch again, lounging and sleeping like a baby. I'm going to set up a vet visit for tomorrow if I can and see if her family is missing her, because she is so sweet and cuddly. Absolutely no aggression at all, and she even let me pick her up and examine her for injuries. I really hope someone didn’t just abandon this sweet baby, but if she doesn’t have a family to go home to, she has us—because we love her already. Now Cleo naps like she has always belonged, because she has. She just needed the right people to remind her. And OP was ready. The world needs more people like them, gentle, loving, and willing to wait for a cat to come home.",
