  "text": "Published: January 7, 2025 DURHAM, NC—Shrugging as he issued a half-hearted apology for his absence, Duke freshman basketball player Cooper Flagg confirmed Tuesday he would be out for two weeks due to a family trip to Hilton Head Island. “I really want to be there for all my Duke teammates, but this is something we’ve had planned for months,” said the 18-year-old NBA prospect, who stood on the curb outside his dorm wearing a backpack and holding a pillow as he waited for his parents to pick him up. “We take a beach trip every year. It’s kind of a big deal, so I can’t miss it. The hotel’s already booked. Plus, it will be good to see Grandma. I’d like to get back to the court as quickly as possible, but it might be kind of tricky considering my Mom scheduled a sunset dolphin cruise for the last day.” At press time, Flagg added that he might return an extra day late if he was sunburned and feeling tired.
