  "description": "Some people use words to solve disputes, and others use eggs. Depending on where you grew up, you might have been an egg-thrower yourself around Halloween time for \"mischief night,\" or you just had an affinity for vandalism and egged someone's house as retaliation, like the kids in this Reddit story. When these kids saw the neighbor's car parked in the way of their play area, they hatched a plan (egg pun intended) and declared an egg war lasting several days. Their wiffle ball games were clearly important to them.In this story, the neighbor, a teacher, decides to beat the neighborhood kids at their own game, decorating their parents' windshields sunny side up style. You'd have to be pretty annoyed to spend your cash on some eggs, only to toss them on someone's car. After all, eggs are a hot commodity in today's economy. But that's exactly how this teacher fights back and teaches the kids a lesson.",
