  "text": "New Zealand singer-songwriter Lorde has released Virgin, her fourth studio album. The Onion sat down with the artist to discuss identity, inspiration, and what’s next. The Onion: How has your music evolved as you’ve gotten older? Lorde: When I was younger I was really intimidated by the black keys on the piano, but now I can’t get enough of them. The Onion: What inspired the X-ray album cover? Lorde: It’s an homage to the TV show Bones. The Onion: Are you touring soon? Lorde: I hope not. I just signed up for a pizza-making class. The Onion: What’s your writing process like? Lorde: My secretary types up my thoughts and faxes them to Jack Antonoff. The Onion: Who are some artists you’d like to collaborate with in the future? Lorde: I’ve always wanted to work with one of those guys who paints themselves silver and pretends to be a statue. The Onion: You’ve described yourself as “in the middle gender-wise.” What does this mean to you? Lorde: Sitting on a horse in oversized Wranglers, no top. Alternatively, standing barefoot in the rain in a wedding dress. And in both of these scenarios it’s heavily implied that I’m a ghost. The Onion: What are some things to consider when tying a bowline knot? Lorde: The bowline is an extremely secure knot, but can be hard to adjust. It all comes down to context. The Onion: What’s next for you? Lorde: Disappearing into some tall grass.",
