  "description": "Asking your significant other to pay for social events they're not invited to is next-level entitlement. It's also the recipe for a breakup in the making.Here's the thing: it's important in any relationship to have independent activities. One should not have one's entire social life tied to partnership. For this couple, \"bro nights\" are probably necessary for the 26-year-old boyfriend, and it's a good thing that these two have designated socializing that they do independently of one another. That being said, the fact that he cannot seem to afford these gatherings without the help of his 24-year-old girlfriend speaks to a larger problem in the relationship. Furthermore, the fact that he had the audacity to ask her to pay for him and all his friends when she herself would not be invited to said \"bro night\" is even worse!",

In this instance, this 26-year-old guy should certainly be able to pay for “bro night\" with his friends without the participation of his younger girlfriend. The fact that he was upset that his girlfriend refused to foot the bill because it made him look less like the boss of the relationship is also incredibly strange. If he were the boss, wouldn't he be able to pay for his own social life? Some dudes really have no idea how to hold down a significant other these days, do they?",
