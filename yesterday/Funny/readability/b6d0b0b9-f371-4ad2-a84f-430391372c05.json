  "description": "Imagine having a coworker who takes a little bit of everyone else's lunch, but then is also the loudest to complain about it! One person did just that: he would steal a little bit from each coworker's lunch, then loudly whine about how terrible it was that they were \"all\" getting stolen from. At least when that person got caught, they were swiftly shunned by the entire workplace! No matter how hungry you are, stealing from your coworkers is just bad form. I think some people like the thrill of the theft, though. There must be a certain thrill in pilfering the clementines of the dude who sits next to you plus the pasta salad that the accountant brought in and making yourself a de facto lunch. It's also just very cringe and sad. Even if they can't afford food, there are food pantries where they could get free meals! You can't just have sticky fingers whenever you decide you're ready for a treat. Check out the stories of workplace food thefts below, especially the \"monkey thieves\" story! Next, check out these oddly designed items made for people with questionable taste, leading one person to muse, \"Can't decide if I love them or hate them.\"",
