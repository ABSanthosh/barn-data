  "description": "This birthday party went downhill so quickly! It's a shame that this person volunteered to plan a double birthday party for their 64-year-old FIL and their 60-year-old MIL. It was supposed to be a lovely time, as u/Diylion explains. They invited 10 people to a local venue…but things just went wrong from the start. Sometimes, despite your best efforts, things will go wrong in life. And as they say, the show (or party!) must go on! It's not like you can just tell your entire party of 10 people that there's not going to be an event, actually, and that they should just pack it up and head home. This person did arrive early with a big group, which can't be accommodated by all restaurants. But even after they patiently waited outside the otherwise empty venue, they were still turned down. It might be one of those times that the person writing a 1-star review isn't overreacting. They got very petty with their revenge, and hopefully, it's a good learning experience for the manager of the place. Although he begged this person to take down their numerous reviews, he was denied. The truth is now out there, and maybe the manager will think twice about being unaccommodating towards guests. Up next, this person explains why they're \"reporting my TikTok famous sister\" who can't stop spilling family secrets online.",
