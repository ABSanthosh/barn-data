  "description": "There's not a single person in the world who does not have at least one bad experience with customer service. Even though customer service's single job is to provide service to the customer, countless problems always prevent them from doing that job. We're not necessarily pointing fingers at those who work there, but, c'mon, someone must take the blame.If you ask us, the worst kind of customer service, is when something breaks in our apartment, and we need someone to come and fix it. It starts with spending hours on the phone trying to reach the company in charge of the repair. Then you must schedule a time for someone to come and fix it, which is never a comfortable time for you, but you make it work anyway. Except, when the day finally comes, and you cleared up your entire schedule for this one thing, they are either extremely late, or never even show up in the first place. And then the cycle begins again…However, for the customer in the story below, things went a little differently…",
