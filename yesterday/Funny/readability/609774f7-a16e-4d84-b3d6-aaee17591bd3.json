  "text": "Long ago, what YouTube tells me is Seven Years Ago, Gabe ran an episode of my old Acquisitions Incorporated: The \"C\" Team show. Called simply Jimterlude, because it was a Mike Krahulik DM Experience Tee Em, of course it involved an incredibly elaborate, fully functional board game called Wizard Kart. I want to emphasize that Wizard Kart is our wholly owned, original IP and any resemblance or even direct references to other games are either just some thing you made up or direct attacks on our sovereignty. In either case, they're deeply unwelcome!!! In the original, Jim Darkmagic's young apprentice slash personal assistant - Diz Iberron - summons the party with a magic bell, and tells them that in the process of perfecting a stunning new trick Mr. Darkmagic has transformed himself into three baby chicks. Only by winning at Wizard Kart and receiving a wish from its mysterious administrator the wizard Abnis can the adventurers return Jim to his original form. It's probably not the best use of a wish ever, but that's the sitch. Well, Seven Years Hence, Super Wizard Kart is here. Only freshly filmed over the weekend, the hotly anticipated sequel has a bunch of shit that you won't believe. We didn't believe it, not fully, and it was physically in front of us. Gabe didn't even like cars when he did the first one, and now he really, really liked cars, which are essentially big Karts. I strongly suspect you will feel the flavor, and he's gonna release all the rules and graphics so you can fuck around with it yourself. As they say in the Nintendo Direct, \"Please look forward to it.\" (CW)TB out.",
