  "description": "It's Tuesday, feline fam, and all we want to do today is curl up in our beds and snuggle with our cats all day. To be fair, that's what we want to do every day, but especially on this cold, wintery Tuesday. If we could pick our purrfect cuddle puddle, it would be with a family of cheetahs. It would be like cuddling with a great dane, but better, because it would be a giant cat that meows and purrs. Just imagine how soft it would be. Just imagine purrs from a 120 lb. cat…it must be meowgical. Now, multiply that by three, and you've successfully managed to expurrience what the hooman guard in this video gets to enjoy every night. He guards a family of cheetahs at a wildlife reserve, and while sleeping under the stars, the large feline family snuck in for a cuddle puddle overnight, showcasing the heartwarming connections pawssible between hoomans and animals. We're not just awwwww-ing over this, we're also pawsitively jealous. Scroll down to watch the wholesome video below!",

If we had known that was pawssible, we would have signed up to go rough it in nature way earlier. Who needs a bed when you have three giant fluffy pillows that come with infinite purring power?  We seriously got into the wrong line of work. Don't get us wrong, we love sharing these wholesome and heartwarming stories with you. But when is it time for us to be the bride and no longer the bridesmaid? When will we get to snuggle with cheetahs instead of watching videos about it? Anyone know where we can sign up to do this? We're expurrt snugglers. And we love cats. What else do we need to know?",
