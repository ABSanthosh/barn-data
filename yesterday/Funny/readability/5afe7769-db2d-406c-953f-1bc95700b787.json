  "description": "Never mess with the person who makes your food. Any adult should be grateful when another person cooks for them, so insulting their culinary skills on top of that is just playing with fire–or, in this place, hot chili oil. This spicy Gen X mom was tired of dealing with her son's complaints about her 'bland' cooking, so without hesitation, she taught him a lesson, making him eat his own words... on the Scoville Scale. Spicy food is special in my heart, but my mouth can't handle it. I can have 1-3 bites of something really spicy–like Thai food rated 9 or 10–and I've got to take a few breaks. Considering a glass of milk from the fridge, I often dream of ways to get around my tender-mouthed tendencies with no success. Turns out, my palate craves the blandness as much as my soul craves the spice. This was the case for the entitled 27-year-old in this next tale who couldn't put his money where his mouth was and paid the price–and with a gallon of dairy and some memorable chemical burns in his mouth, he learned his lesson.",
