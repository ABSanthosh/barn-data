  "description": "We know that some people still don't believe this, but cats have feelings. Yes, shocking, we know. Cats are not aloof and uncaring and unfeeling like some haters still say that they are. Cats feel deeply - everything from love to pain. And hard as it may be for those haters to understand, cats love their owners a lot. More than we know. And for a cat to get abandoned by its owner is one of the worst things that you could do to it.Now, the cat in this story wasn't exactly abandoned. Her owner passed away, sadly, and even more sadly, the cat was found - with her owner - a week after their passing. We don't know how much the cat understood - we don't know if it was abandonment that she was feeling or just plain loss. What we do know is that she was angry, she was anxious, the rest of her family gave up on her, and the shelter she ended up in deemed her \"unadoptable\". It was the end of the road for Barbara… until, thankfully, someone took a chance on her.",
