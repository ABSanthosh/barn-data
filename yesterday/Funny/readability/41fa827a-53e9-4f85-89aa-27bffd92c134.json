  "description": "Is it just a thing that hospitals must have the most inaccessible parking around?I'll never forget the irony of having to walk (hobble) 10 minutes down the road and across the adjacent park and across the adjacent park on my freshly broken ankle away from the local hospital where there was the closest parking available. And, of course, this was in the early hours of the morning after waiting 8 hours in the emergency department and in the not-so-nice part of town.To make matters even worse, you'd have to imagine that the staff of the hospital were doing the same thing I had to do daily, meaning that nursing and support staff getting off early shifts were walking through the dark, unlit park and side streets alone in the early hours to get to their vehicles.So, in a way, you can understand the need for this hospital's staff to find closer parking, but doing so at the expense of a local family-run business is not the way to do it… making this story just another example of the extreme lengths people will go to in order to secure parking for their vehicles.",
