  "description": "Hello cat-loving humans. Those of us who have cats at home know that there is never a dull moment with your faithful feline companions. One moment you could gaze at them sleeping on the dog's bed, snoring softly but adorably, the next moment they're knocking over all of your good china. Oh yeah, things get real interesting real fast. One thing however remains consistent, and that is the way that our cats simultaneously bring both joy and chaos to our every day human lives. Cats make life so much more interesting. On that note, I'm thinking back to a time when I flew across the country with my cat to visit family, and he was being such a good boy just sleeping in his carrier throughout the flight. I had managed to doze off on this flight, which was about 6 hours of flight time total, only to feel a tap at my shoulder a few moments later. The person next to me alerted me that my cat had escaped from his carrier and was making his rounds around the plane. And that just about sums up the joy and chaos of being a cat parent. Enjoy all the silliness!",
