  "description": "If you get fired for standing up for yourself, at least you know that you lived up to your own moral standards. While many companies care about their employees, there are tons of places who could care less. There are others that seem to go out of their way to make their employees miserable! For example, some retail places schedule their employees, including their best and most hardworking people, to do \"clopening\" shifts. These dreaded shifts are often something like 4 PM to midnight to close the store. Then, the very next day, just a few hours later, the employee is scheduled for a shift of 5 AM to 1 PM. It's a brutal shift to be assigned to. You basically close the store, sleep for a couple of hours, then drag yourself out of bed to reopen the store all over again. This is very bad for employees, obviously, but many places simply do not care. In office environments, some bosses just lack any tact or grace. Below there are a few stories of workers who needed to call out of work for good reasons, and yet were still scolded for it. If a worker needs to attend to something urgent and their boss still thinks that it's more important that the employee show up and sweep the floors, well, it might just be time to walk out the door and never return. Next, check out some businesses whose LED signs went out, leaving them with signs saying less appealing things like \"Red Loser\" and \"Rat Beef Sandwich.\"",
