  "description": "Whether you're a workplace rookie or a veteran employee, sometimes it's difficult to discern the glaring red flags toxic managers spell out for you as if they're waiting to get reported. In every line of work, every industry, and every floor of an office building, several employees have bizarre personality traits that directly (and negatively) affect colleagues and employees. These employees, however, don't care. Why? They have a higher title to protect them from any real retribution. Coming to terms with the fact that you're reporting to a narcissistic manager might be a bit difficult at first, but as you'll read in the discussion below, it gets easier with time. The current job market doesn't allow us to be picky most of the time, but knowing how to combat (or drown out) a toxic manager's gameplay is the first step in leaving for greener pastures. Below, you'll read about the moments employees realized their boss was majorly toxic. Scroll below.",
