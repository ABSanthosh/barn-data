  "description": "Not every cat is born the same, the same way as people. And being different doesn't make you - or the cat - any less purrfect. Some cats are born blind, and that does not stop them for one second from living their lives to the fullest. Some cats are born deaf, and despite the fact that they can't hear themselves screaming, they will put their whole hearts into it so that you hear them. Some cats are born with four ears, and they will use all four of them to ignore you. And some cats, like the one in this video, are born as little medical mysteries, and they are still purrfect. Now, this kitten really is a puzzle. Because the lump on her head is apparently what ended up keeping her alive for so long, but there is no guarantee that it will continue to do so, and so her owners are faced with an unexpected conundrum, but they love her so much that we trust them, no matter what decision they make.",
