  "description": "Oh, the meowing morning is here. And to make things even worse, it's a Meownday morning. Oh, meowing Monday, why does this day come every week? Can't it skip a week every once in a while? It means we need to get out of bed and do all these hooman things, like going to work and doing our job. Blah. Well, at least we've had a great weekend with our cat. We snuggled and cuddled all throughout Saturday, and played with the red laser dot all throughout Sunday. But now? Now it's meowing Monday. And no, we're not ready. We want another weekend day with our cat, please.Well, you know? At least we have cat memes. If nothing else, any feline fan can enjoy a bit of cat comedy during that day until we can get back home to our cats. It's like a secret weapon to deal with meowing Mondays. And only us, fellow feline fanatic fans all around the globe, are aware of it. So let's enjoy some Monday cat memes, shall we?",
