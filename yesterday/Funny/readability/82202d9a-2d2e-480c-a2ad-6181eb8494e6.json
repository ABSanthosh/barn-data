  "description": "Cats are criminals. We mean that when we say it. We mean that in the literal sense. Cats commit crimes. Sometimes, they do it right in front of our faces, with no shame at all. Cats steal food right off our plates. Heck, they may be looking straight into our eyes when they do it, and they feel no remorse. Sometimes, it's small things like that. Other times, cats lock us out of our own bathrooms. And even beyond that, sometimes, cats rob grocery stores and steal… you guessed it, sausages. This has all happened, but somehow, they have managed to get away. Every single time. Probably because of how cute they are. But not today. Today, a criminal was apprehended. The cats crime? Running away from home and then swiping at the officers who were trying to be nice and rescue it. And so, here we are, a cat is written up in the system. There are even paw prints and a mugshot to prove that the crime happened. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

  "text": "According to SCMP, on May 9, a Bangkok police shared the story of this unusual criminal - a lost American Shorthair cat that was brought in by a citizen. He was brought into the station and taken care of. “This cat has been charged with assaulting police officers and is about to be detained. Please share this post so her owner can come and bail her out,” Pakeesuk wrote in a post online, already having prepared food, litter and toys for the kitty.  This officer, who loves animals, took the cat to his own home for the night, and has, apparently, saved over 20 stray cats and dogs over time. A day after making the post, the owner of the cat reached out to the officer, and the two were reunited safely. Of course, a police report had to be issued about the incident, and in it, the officer wrote: “I was just hungry. I did not mean to bite anyone.” And Nub Tang signed the report with two paw prints, and a very necessary mugshot was taken. “This case must be handled properly. We cannot have other cats thinking that biting people is acceptable,” Pakeesuk added.",
