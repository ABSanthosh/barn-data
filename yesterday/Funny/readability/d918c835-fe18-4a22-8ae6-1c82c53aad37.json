  "description": "Have you ever been so befuddled by a sign that you just walked away? There are quite a few signs here that might make a person do just that! I often encounter door signs that will instruct a person to use the other door. So then I walk around the corner searching for said entrance, only to be pointed towards another sign. Sometimes they're written unclearly, or the arrows don't face the right way, and I waste a lot of time trying to figure out where to go into this place! It's honestly pretty funny when this happens organically, and quite a few people here have snapped funny photos of the times this happened to them. From yard sale signs that are more confusing than helpful, to inspirational signs that inspire the opposite message, to signs that just got plain messed up, you can have a laugh at a bunch of them down below.Next, read about what happened when this 29-year-old employee confronted her 42-year-old boss who took a team-building experience way too seriously: 'My boss is giving me the cold shoulder.'",
