  "description": "Where would the world be without our wholesome cat community, feline fam? Cats would just be wandering the streets, causing chaos, and probably, the whole world would fall apart. Thankfully, we don't have to face that scenario (yet) because of all of the ameowzing people that put cats before themselves and go out of their way to help floofy felines survive in this hooman world. There always seems to be someone to pick up the pieces where one purrson drops them, and for that, we are purrfectly grateful.One of the things we least understand is people who don't take their pets with them when they move. We know it's hard to move with pets, our cats did not like when we moved to a new apartment, but eventually, they got over it. But leaving them behind was never an option. And yet, some people do it! After one family moved out and left their sassy black cat behind, a kind neighbor stepped up and rescued the wholesome house panther. See more below!",
