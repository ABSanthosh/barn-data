  "description": "For those of you not in the know, a streamer named Dr. Lupo - we played Amogus with him for charity! - admitted to cheating in a chess tournament. I don't think I would enter a tournament for a game I didn't know how to play except as comic relief or something. I would gladly get dumpstered live, but then, my work mostly involves making jokes at my own expense.",

Something happens in my head when I start to see a little curl of data reach out toward another and join hands. Did he not have a coach that told him when you cheat, you cheat yourself?! So now, motherfuckers on Reddit are going over old footage of him looking for more bad shit and they're gonna find it. No life can endure the kind of scrutiny the Internet can bring to bear. There's another parallel causality where he didn't do that, and instead of feeling like shit and having his life pried open by ravenous crows he's eating a Blastin' Berry Hot Colors Fruit Roll-Up and fucking around with his kid. Anyway. Don't forget! The best merch line we've ever offered for PAX is available now, yea, even from home. (CW)TB out.",
