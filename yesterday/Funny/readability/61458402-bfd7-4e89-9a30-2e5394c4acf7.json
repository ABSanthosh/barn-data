  "description": "We’re just about one month away for this year’s Child’s Play Charity auction and dinner, on November 22nd! I’ll be there and I’d love it if you joined me. You can find more details and read up on what Child’s Play has been doing in my post right here or just go directly to the site and buy your tickets right here. It’s a super fun event so come help us raise money for a great cause! -Gabe Out",
