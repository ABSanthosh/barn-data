  "description": "We've all heard of the evil step-mothers from Disney movies growing up, but an evil step-father is an entirely different ball game. This usually includes way more physical altercations and sometimes even a prison sentence. If you have seen any toxic man with anger issues raised with misogyny, then you get the picture. And they used to totally get away with it! But it isn't the 1950s anymore, and more and more people are standing up to these \"evil step-feathers.\"  Take for instance this young man who made his sister beam with pride! When they were young, their parents got divorced and their mother started dating a man who turned out to be horrible. Lucky, their mom eventually left him and even got a restraining order. So, even though the trauma was done, they were given a chance to heal, and heal they did. Healing is never linear, however, and there is no limit to healing. So, when this guy came across his ex-evil-step dad 25 years later, he still was able to enact something he needed for his healing process: Shame. That's right! Sometimes you just have to shame the person who caused you trauma in front of your society to get some final satisfaction.",
