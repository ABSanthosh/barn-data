Kate Bishop Devil Dinosaur I gotta say, I am so glad the folks at Second Dinner and Marvel let me do this pose. When you do these sorts of projects you have to deliver a few different sketch options and l gave them two pretty standard designs and then this one assuming they would never go for it. I can’t wait to see it in the game with the 3D effect! In addition to all my new cards hitting the game, PAX East attendees can play the PAX XP game to get a special bundle that includes my Miles Morales Variant along with Dabe’s incredible new card back and some other goodies! Here’s a look at all my current Snap Variants which you’ll be able to collect in an Album soon! -Gabe Out",
