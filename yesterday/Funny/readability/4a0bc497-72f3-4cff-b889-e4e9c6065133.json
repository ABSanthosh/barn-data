  "text": "Published: December 30, 2024 CHICAGO—Insisting that he thought what he had seen was great despite his complete lack of experience with the visual art form, local man Nick Tyler reportedly lied Monday about having seen any movies at all in order to impress his friends. “Oh yeah, it’s so fantastic how the images moved and there was audio and stuff—that was actually my favorite part,” said Tyler, who went on to falsely describe to his work acquaintances how he had actually watched several movies and particularly appreciated the way they made use of directing and acting. “It was a cool decision to work from scripts—and, uh, computers, maybe?—to tell a story. Very innovative. I saw movies last week, but I might even see other movies soon. That’s how much I enjoyed them.” Tyler went on to state that he perhaps liked movies even more than music and television, two other mediums with which he was also entirely unfamiliar.
