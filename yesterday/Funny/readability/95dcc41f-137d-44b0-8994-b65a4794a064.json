  "description": "Some employers love to preach loyalty, but as soon as they think that they might be better off without you—or that you haven't made them as much money as you could have—they won't hesitate to send you packing, no matter how long you've worked together and what your contributions have been previously. This isn't true of all employers and all situations, but the bad experiences, stories, and accounts are enough to make anyone wary.What's certain here is that you should never give notice to an employer whilst traveling, that's just begging for disaster and to be stranded wherever you are with the burden and expense of getting yourself home placed squarely on your shoulders. Sure, depending on the circumstances involved, you might be able to pursue legal action, but it's better not to be placed in a compromising and possibly unsafe situation in the first place. This is tricky, of course, if you're always traveling for work, leaving little opportunity to safely give notice.This supervisor aimed to leave his current employer on good terms due to unexplained circumstances. Not wanting to burn any bridges and looking to leave the door open to working together in the future, he gave his two-week notice while away on assignment. He was surprised to find that his employer's response was to immediately cancel his return flight home, stranding him where he was stationed for work.Frustrated, he turned to this online community to share his experience, garnering ample advice and reactions from readers.",
