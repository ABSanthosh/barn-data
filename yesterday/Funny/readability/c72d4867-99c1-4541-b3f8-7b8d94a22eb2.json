  "description": "Hey, feline family and friends. One of the scariest things that could pawssibly happen to us as cat owners is for our cats to accidentally run away. Lost cats are much harder to find than lost dogs. Thankfully it hasn't ever happened to us, but it's a story that's all too common amongst us pawrents. The fear you will never find them again can be overwhelming. Luckily, the internet is full of happy stories of people finding their cats again! This one, however, is not quite what we expected. After losing their cat in October, this feline father was going through it. But, a few weeks ago, one of their neighbors messaged them saying that they had found their cat! Cue the happy dance! However, upon further inspection, the cat dad started to question some things. The cat responded to his name…but had different colored toe beans than his original cat. The pictures below show the differences, and we have to say, this is quite the kitty conundrum! Scroll down to see if they are different cats or not…we're honestly not sure.",

We're surprised this pawrent didn't go into more detail about the personality characteristics of his cat and this new cat. Are their purrsonalities also similar?
