  "description": "Grief is a hard nut to crack; there's just no two ways about it. There's no way of speeding through it or predicting what course it will take, either; when it will show up day to day or month to month, and how it will present itself. Scars don't fade quickly, and having people place demands or expectations on you during this time is sure to cause you to crumble under the pressure or lead to long-term and lasting effects.This 16-year-old girl was struggling to cope with the loss of her mother when her world was turned on its head again with the arrival of a woman who claimed to be carrying her father's baby, only 9 months after the loss of her mother. Everything was moving far too quickly, and the girl felt that this was hypocritical of her father since he had always criticized others in similar situations. The mutual bad feelings and the difficult situation presented, combined with the changing family dynamics and extremely complex emotions caused everything to boil over, prompting the girl to move out of her father's home and move in with her grandparents, something her father's new girlfriend took further offense too, especially when the father continued to try and make things work with his daughter.Who knows what prompted this and what the father's true feelings are? Maybe he made a mistake after the loss of his wife and is trying to do right by them, but this is certainly one situation with no clear-cut right answer. What is clear though is that the girl needs time to grieve and support, support that she is lucky to be able to receive from other family.",
