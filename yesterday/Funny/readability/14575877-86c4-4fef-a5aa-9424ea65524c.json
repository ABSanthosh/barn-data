  "description": "As a parent, there's nothing more valuable than time with your kids. Especially when they're little, time flies by so quickly, and their childhood goes by in a flash. Suddenly, your sweet baby is turning into a teenager before your eyes, and it's as if only a few short moments have passed. This dutiful dad in our next story found a way to capitalize on every moment with his growing son by taking advantage of his own work ethic. With the advantageous 'project manager' title at his back, he carved out 2-hour lunches every single day, blocking out his calendar and marking himself as 'busy' so that he could hang out with his growing young son at home. Some may call this remote worker's tactics 'cheating the system,' but as a worker familiar with how the system cheats us, I'd say he's just found the perfect loophole to be the best dad possible. I say, if you can get the job done, exceed expectations, and remain a valuable asset to the team, so what if you only work a 30-hour work week for 40 hours of pay?",
