  "description": "Nothing in this world can make us happy about going back to work tomorrow. Literally nothing….except for cats. Cats make everything better! From their smooshy little faces to their purrfect paws, we're only mildly obsessed with them and their serotonin-producing nature. However, there is one type of cat that we especially love, and those cats are pallas' cats. Known as the world's most expressive cat, pallas' cats are truly one-of-a-kind, and also one of the floofiest! So, to soften (literally) our arrival to the work week, we brought some pictures of purrfect pallas' cats and an adorable abundance of floofy fluffballs.If you thought normal cats were floofy, just wait until you feast your eyes on these fluffy felines. Move over Maine coons and Norweigan forest cats, pallas' cats are here to get their hairs all over your house, your clothes, even your food, and they've got the floofy tails to prove it. Embrace these fluffballs like the warm, pawsitive creatures they are and we hope you have a very soft beginning of your work week. Bye!",
