  "description": "A good parent will do just about anything to protect their family. And when it came down to the wire for the man in this next story, he would stop at nothing to give his kiddos a better life—even when prospects seemed bleak. Perseverance is an admirable quality. While it's always simpler to give up and throw in the towel, hanging in there and working hard (the honest way), can feel impossible. In my last year of college, I had no money. My parents had no money, I worked two jobs to pay for school, and my housing plan had just fallen through. Things weren't looking good for my senior year of university, and I thought for sure I'd have to drop out and move somewhere cheaper. Instead, I stayed plugged in on campus, slept on couches, at work, and in my professor's office for a month until I found a random stranger who listed their garage for rent as a 'studio.' It wasn't much, but I was beyond thrilled! Securing that cramped, dank studio was such a colosal win, and put the wind back in my sails when I'd contemplated giving up. Sometimes all you need is a win and a landlord who trusts you'll pay rent on time and be a good tenant, which is exactly what the single dad in this next story experienced first-hand.",
