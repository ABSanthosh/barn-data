  "description": "No one is going to agree on everything, and when it comes to a game where almost everything is in part determined by imagination, what you imagine might not be in line with everyone else at the table. As with anything in life, inevitably, personalities, ideas, and preferences will clash, and it's all down to tolerance and an ability and willingness to go with the flow. Not being set in your own ways and ideas just makes everything easier, even if everything isn't exactly the way you want it. That, after all, is what collaboration is all about.Of course, that's all good and well to say until the annoying rogue in your party insists on murder-hoboing every NPC before the story can properly unfold while ticking every box of edge lord cliches possible. At that point, you're probably going to have a court of group opinion put an end to their ideas. The same can be said for any player who takes an overly simplistic and predictable approach to interactions in the game. At a certain point, they're just taking over and steering the course of the campaign in a predictable manner, which can become grating to the other people at the table. These players disagreed over the \"flirtatious\" nature of the 19-year-old player's character. One player took issue with her character's flirtatious approach to every interaction and demanded that she stop. The player then took to this online community to see whether she was in the wrong for refusing to do so.",
