  "description": "Inheritance is certainly one way to tear a family apart. No one wants to admit that they care about material possessions when the concept comes up near the end of a family member's life, but guess what? When push comes to shove, it's always surprising to see whose claws come out.Sometimes, the people who claim to not care are the ones who become the most entitled and possessive throughout the difficult process of going through a family member's belongings. Sometimes, the people you would think would be insanely difficult end up being the decent ones with a stronger understanding of fairness than anyone anticipated. Unfortunately, it only takes one person's ego to make the process more difficult than it needs to be. Here's a multi-part saga about an entitled father who insisted that he deserved the majority of the grandfather's inheritance. When the grandfather himself caught wind of this tension, he decided to change the will without the father's knowledge.",
