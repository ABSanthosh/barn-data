  "description": "Safety rules are there for a reason, but some workers refuse to believe something until they see proof of it. If you're doing a physical task and it seems like there are all these irritating rules in place, I know it can be frustrating. It's easy to think you know better, and to just start doing things your own way. But with safety regulations, there's almost always a dark back story to go along with it. Someone was harmed by doing the exact same thing as you, and a rule was made to keep it from happening again. You'd think an older worker would know this just from lived experience alone… but not everyone is that bright. At least his coworkers didn't have to deal with him for long before the boss caught on. No one should ever have to work in an unsafe environment, and rules are there to try and keep everyone safe, not just the people who feel like abiding by them. Up next, read about the mother of 2 tween girls who demanded an airline passenger move to a middle seat: \"This is about needing to sit next to my kids.\"",
