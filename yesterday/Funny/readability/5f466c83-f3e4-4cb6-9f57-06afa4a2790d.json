  "description": "You open your gift on Christmas morning, and you discover that within the wrap is a cat meme. Well, that's ok, you have other gifts to open, so you open a second gift… and it's a cat meme. Okay, what are the chances? You open a third gift, expecting to have something useful, or fun, but you see another cat meme. Now, that's weird… You ask your siblings to open their gifts as well, and as they open one gift, and another, and another, all of them turn out to be cat memes. Just cat memes! All you got for Christmas is a bunch of cat memes, but they are Christmas cat memes - they're ready to celebrate like there's no tomorrow.We gathered all the Christmas cat memes you received this year right down here, so you can view them with comfort, and celebrate your holiday with them. And with your cat. And with all the rest of the cat memes you still haven't seen this Christmas.",
