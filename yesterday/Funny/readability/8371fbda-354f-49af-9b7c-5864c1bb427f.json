  "description": "Sometimes the burnout is simply larger than us. There is nothing we can do, nothing someone can say, that will keep the fiery flames of this burnout at bay. It is simply the nature of these things. And unfortunately in such situations we almost always turn to destructive behavior, and more often than not, it harms us rather than those around. Which is why we decided that you might manage to take a moment away from that maelstrom to indulge in some similarly destructive cattos to give the effect of looking in a mirror and watching your alternate self get into destructive situations, without you having to handle the consequences.So if you are ready to wash your hands of clawminal responsibility and pass it on to the felines who cannot be held accountable for their actions, then settle in and enjoy.",

  "text": "There is no denying it is tough to keep it together when you are on a path of self-destruction devoid of decorum. But if you are able to cloak your feisty remarks with some calculated compliments, you will go much further in life than if you let your burnout get the better of you. Hooweee, this is one heck of a line to bust out when you are being berated by someone who you simply cannot tolerate. And at that it is also a good motto to live by, because really who are we to judge others on their actions, especially when judging people is probably something we shouldn't be doing in the first place.",
