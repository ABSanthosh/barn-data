  "description": "It's a pretty rough winter out there in some places. Sometimes, we don't notice, what with being inside - in the office or at home, cuddles up under blankets with our cats, keeping warm as the world gets covered in a blanket of white out there. But it's true. And it's important to pay attention. This winter, we have come across so many stories of cats freezing alone outside in these harsh winter conditions, and we want everyone to make sure that their cats are not going to join this list. It happens though. Cats are curious creatures, and they do manage to escape out sights every once in a while. Even this senior blind cat somehow slipped past its owner and ended up running out into the cold. This cat would have frozen has he not been rescued in time, that's a certainty. The woman who spotted him \"floating\" in the middle of the lake saw him drowning. It's a miracle that the kitty was saved, and we are thankful to everyone involved in the rescue. Now, we just have to hope that no more stories like these are going to come across our feeds any time in the future.",

So many people had to come together - everyone from the woman who spotted the cat and called for help all the way to the two men who put everything aside to get into a boat, break the ice, and get the cat. And we are thankful to each and every one of them.  All's well that ends well, that's true, but we do hope that the owner takes it as a lesson. From the sound of it, this kitty was an outside kitty - or at least, he was allowed to go into the wild world on his own. And although we know that changes are difficult for cats at this age, it might be worth it to keep him at home from now own, considering the circumstances.",
