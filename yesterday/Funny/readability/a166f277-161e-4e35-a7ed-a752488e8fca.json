  "description": "\"The law is the law,\" this person bragged as they made their neighbor replace his whole entire fence. Sometimes the impulse toward pettiness can pay off! U/Sospuff has an awful neighbor who is making a big fuss over the fence the two of them share. It's not an ideal situation: this person has three kids, and the neighbor has a dog that the original poster believes poses a danger. It's understandable that this person would want to protect their kids. However, as they shared in a post to r/pettyrevenge, even though the missing height of the fence is just a few centimeters, they aren't willing to let it go. The neighbor needs a fence that's two meters tall, and his is just under that amount. But since he's been such a pain for this person, including taking him to court before, this person is absolutely not willing to let it go. They posted an update, as well as defending themself from people who criticized their plan. You can read all about it down below! Up next, take a peek into the life of this free-spirited couple who showed up at a family member's house and decided to live there, leading the family member to realize they \"didn't sign up to be a hotel.\"",
