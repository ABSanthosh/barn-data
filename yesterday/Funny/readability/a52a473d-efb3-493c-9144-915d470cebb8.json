  "description": "If you identify as a 'people pleaser', you know how challenging it is to walk the earth without feeling like a constant disappointment. Dark, I know, but those who know what I am talking about, understand the struggle.Everywhere you look, everywhere you go, there are always people who you want, and need, to please. You want them to like you, so you would do anything to make it happen, even if it hurts you in the process. You absolutely know it makes no sense, that you cannot expect everyone who meets you to like you, and you shouldn't put everyone else's needs above your own. But you do it anyway, and you cannot stop, which is how we end up with stories like the one down below.Wanting to be liked by your neighbors is one of the biggest challenges of a people pleaser, especially because neighbors are the worst. You can be as accommodating and considerate as possible, and your neighbor will still find something to complain about.If you don't believe me, maybe you will after reading this story.",
