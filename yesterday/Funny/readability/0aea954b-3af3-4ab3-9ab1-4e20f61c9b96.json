  "description": "We honestly wish we could tweet about our cat so he could respond. We low-key want to be able to talk to our cat without being met with endless meows that make us think we need to pet him- wait, no, he wants us to pick him up- no, no, no, put him back down immediately- is it a treat that you want?- not this one, okay, okay, we get it- why do you block us from walking?- what do you want?!It'll be so much easier if we could just talk directly to our cat, even through text, and he'll answer. But since this is not the case, with every cat - all cat pawrents turn to share their cats' shenanigans online. We gathered some hilariously accurate cat tweets made by cat pawrents, who we're sure would like to have a real word with their cats as we do, but can't. As we can't. Believe us, if you're a cat pawrent - this bunch of cat tweets is the most relatable it gets out there.",
