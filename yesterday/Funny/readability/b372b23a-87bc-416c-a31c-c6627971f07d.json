  "description": "Who here hasn't had an encounter with another person, where the only thing you wanted to do was shake that person up, and make them open their eyes to see they are not the only person in the world? If you could just teach them this one lesson, if they could just see that their actions affect other people, maybe the world could be a slightly better one.Do we actually shake that person up? Can we get anything through their thick heads? Well, it depends on how creative you get with your lesson. Because just telling them what they are doing wrong will probably not stick the landing. It needs to be something they will remember, something that forces them to open their eyes, and hopefully, to keep them open for quite some time…The neighbor in the story below wanted to teach an entitled driver that he can't just park his car wherever he pleases, so they truly got creative with the lesson plan.",
