  "text": "Published: December 2, 2024 FLORHAM PARK, NJ—Apologizing to fans and pledging to do better in the future, New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers demonstrated impressive character this week by taking the blame for the parts of the game where the Jets were winning. “The buck stops with me—I take full responsibility for calling successful plays, creating scoring opportunities, and ultimately doing whatever was necessary to get the football into the end zone,” said Rodgers, who acknowledged that everyone in the organization played a role in the Jets’ loss, but that he was holding himself accountable for every completed pass and touchdown. “When we were leading 14-0, that was absolutely my fault. When the Jets were put in a position to win, that was on me and me alone. At the end of the day, I accept responsibility for every positive play in the game.” Rodgers added that the pass that he threw directly to Seahawks defensive end Leonard Williams, who returned the interception 92-yards for a touchdown, was completely the fault of the receiver.
