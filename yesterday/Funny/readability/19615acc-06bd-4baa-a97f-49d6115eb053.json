  "description": "Cats are meowjestic creatures - and we're not just saying that because we love cats. They really are meowjestic. They can be large and floofy, small and skinny, tiny and regal, and liquid or solid. Yes, you read that correctly. Cats come in both liquid and solid form (although not at the same time). Have you ever tried to pick up your cat and it feels like picking up a sack of potatoes? That's because they were in their liquid form, where they turned their bones into noodles. It's both hissterical and ameowzing, as we don't know any other creature on the planet that can do such a thing. To prove our point, we've collected a whole dinner table full of hilarious pictures of literally liquid cats that are meltier than the butter on your Thanksgiving rolls. If you would pick them up, they would slide right out of your hands. If you would put them in a bowl, they would become the bowl. It's a purrrely feline phenomenon, and one of the many reasons why cats are superior to other pets. But just like the butter on your Thanksgiving rolls, they won't stay liquid for long, so scroll down to soak up all of these feline goodness before it's too late!",
