  "description": "We all know what being a cat pawrent is like - you love your cat children and will do anything for them. When you adopt a cat, you start living for them. And that's not a bad thing! Not at all. Living for a cat is a true blessing. You provide for the most adorable creature on Earth, and get to feel their feline love in return. And as a cat pawrent, you should already know that receiving a cat's love is the most wholesome thing in the world. Your cats look up to you, and you always want to make sure you give them what they need.But when you can't provide your beloved cat children what they need, it's a whole other story. One such cat mama got into a situation where she couldn't afford next month's cat food bag for her two adorable cat children. And let us tell you, from cat pawrents to other cat pawrents, if we were ever in a situation where we could not be certain we'd provide for our cute cat babies, we'd be very stressed. In an attempt to seek advice on what she can feed her cats until she can buy cat food, this cat mama turned to the online feline family for advice.What this cat mama didn't expect was the amount of love and care the online feline family would give her. Not only did she get what she asked for - practical advice on foods that can turn into feline food from things in her kitchen - but she got the wholesome support of other cat pawrents helping her with donations, advice, and warm words that felt like an online hug. Her cats will be okay and well fed - she has nothing to worry about anymore.",

This was one mission, one question, asked to receive advice from cat pawrents who know. But this cat mama really did not expect the sheer amount of love and support she got just by asking for advice. After all the advice she got from many people regarding all the ways to help her cats, she posted a “Thank you” message to everyone. We openly admit it melted our hearts. It's so wholesome to see how the online feline family comes together to help a cat mama in need. We love the online feline family, and every single one of all your cats.",
