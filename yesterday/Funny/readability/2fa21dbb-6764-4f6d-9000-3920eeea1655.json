  "description": "The bond between a hooman and their favorite cat will never break, even if that kitty is not actually yours. Finding a stray on the street is always a heartbreaking experience for a cat lover. Desperately skinny, meowing for help, and likely covered in indignant clouds of dirt, outdoor cats cling to the nearest hooman servant, hoping for a cuddle, a pet, or even a tin of tuna to aid their kitty quest. But not every cat out there is on some kind of quest; in fact, many cats simply get lost, hoping to find their way home somehow. But when you're sharing a brain cell with your other kitty brethren, finding home all by your lonesome isn't so easy. So when this kind hooman found a lost cat out in the wild, she gleefully brought it under her wing. However, less than 24 hours later, and after sleeping on the bathroom floor with her new favorite cat, the original owner was found. What's a cat lover to do? Well, the \"right thing,\" of course.",
