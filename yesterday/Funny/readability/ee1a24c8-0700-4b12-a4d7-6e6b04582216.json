I could barely squeeze through it and got stuck coming back out, which would have been an embarrassing way to die. Still no clue what it was. Grow room? Murder Pantry? Unfinished cabinet to A cut-rate Narnia? Panic room for cats? Discotheque for toddlers? In other mysteries, I have been flooded with the weirdest sort of spam comments lately. They’re specific to the post but then absolutely insane at the end and they are cracking me up. A few new favorites: ”I’m so sorry to hear about your cancer diagnosis AND ENJOY THE HOT SLUTTS IN ATLANTIC CITY TONIGHT!” ”Your book roundup lists always make me smile. FOR RECURRING TESTICULAR PAIN NEAR MUMBAI PLEASE VISIT.” Is it some kind of AI? No clue. This one is less of a mystery and more of a question…I’m refreshing my taxidermy outfits and can’t decide if Claude works as a showgirl or if he should stay with his old stand- by. Please sound off.
