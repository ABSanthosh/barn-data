  "description": "It amazes us how still, despite of all of the information that is out there, despite of all the stories that we hear, some people are still surprised when they get adopted by a cat. It's as if we have not been telling you for years that yes, it's cats who adopt the humans and not the other way around. When you walk into a shelter, you may think that you will adopt a certain cat or kitten, but it is not actually your choice. You are walking in there to be vetted, and it is you who will be the lucky one if you walk out of there with a cat. That's not all people though. Some people have been paying attention. Some people know that when they get adopted by a fluffy feline, there is no point in arguing with it. They understand that one way or another, that feline will make their way into their home. So, really, it's better to just cave. It's either you take your new cat or your new cat will fine a way into your home on their own.",
