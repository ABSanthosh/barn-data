  "description": "One would hope that most managers who work with student workers would be sympathetic to how challenging it can be to balance education with employment. Let's face the facts: if it weren't necessary, most folks wouldn't take on all that responsibility. And yet, there are still far too many employers in this day and age who become far too concerned with their own insular experience that they are then unable to step outside of themselves and understand how hard things may be for their student workers. This Human Resources department is no exception to this fact. Not only did they demand that this student worker put in significantly more hours than what was initially written in his contract, but then they tried to reduce his pay… twice within a span of four months. As many folks in the comments section suggested, it's time for this guy to get out while he can and if he can.Keep scrolling below for the full story.
