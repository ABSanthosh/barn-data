  "description": "Imagine being such a fiscal visionary that you'd rather torch 30% of your profits than let an employee miss one day of work. The logic is airtight: \"If we can't squeeze labor out of you today, we'll just set fire to all future labor forever!\" Why fix a flat tire when you can total the car and blame the road?We've all met bosses who think paid time off is code for personal betrayal, but fusing vacation and sick days? That's just genius! Because what's even the difference between those? You're not at the office, you're not working, and the boss doesn't make any profit off of you, absolutely identical if you ask me.  The common thread? You're a leech on their spreadsheet, regardless of context.To these managerial masterminds, time spent not working is a moral failing—whether you're sipping margaritas or projectile vomiting into a trash can.Firing an employee for catching a virus a coworker gifted the office. probably because of your amazing policies.",
