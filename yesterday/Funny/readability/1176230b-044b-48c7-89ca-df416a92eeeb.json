  "description": "You just know that this girlfriend took one look at this younger brother's situation and thought that it was a goal that she could claim being kept and cared for by her boyfriend for herself. Except that the younger brother is a child for whom her boyfriend is the legal guardian, whereas she is a grown-grass adult who needs to fend for herself, so it's really not the same thing at all. It takes a special kind of someone to look at the care that an adult guardian is offering a child and think to themself, \"I want in on that.\"There's really nothing stopping her from moving in with her boyfriend and his brother together either, but thinking that she can do so without contributing to expenses and then further overstepping by trying to get the little brother out of the way simply so that she can have more space to herself is simply out the gate.There's definitely a lesson to learn here about knowing and understanding the people whom you let into your life, but fortunately, the boyfriend is learning it before it's too late.",
