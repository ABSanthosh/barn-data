  "text": "The squad is essentially splitting time between Rainbow Six and Marvel Rivals now, and because they do something almost completely different you can \"hold space\" for them, as they say. If Marvels was a bit more constrained, or if R6 were a little less… whatever it is, maybe they would start bleeding into each other. In a round of Rainbow, for example, we probably won't be erased from reality by Scarlet Witch's \"Reality Erasure\" ult. You know? It helps you compartmentalize. If you're at the store, and you hear the bark for this ultimate? Don't shop at that store anymore. It is no longer safe. I installed Deadlock because apparently it's really good; when I first installed it, it was frozen in the middle and too hot around the edge. Apparently now it's beef, but after a couple sessions in their Training Hole what I've learned is that I'm not going in there without backup. It's even trying to be nice to me, with crowdsourced itemizations and upgrade paths, but to be entirely one hundred with you I'm surprised that we're still doing that type of shit. I understand What It Enables, in terms of the high skill ceiling, Forever Game potential of builds and counter builds. The character itself, with its entire kit, intersects with the shop and allows for creativity and customization. That all tracks. It's just that when I open that screen up, I go cross eyed. I keep going in there and looking at it every now and then, just to inoculate myself against the next exposure. I was sorta stuck in LoL until a reader showed me the ropes and gave me the basics; maybe that's something else these systems do, is build community.The only trigger that would enable this for me is because I like playing supports, and if I can support better by interacting with these eldritch artifacts or combining them or something that's the only way through. I literally would have to do it for someone else I liked, as an act of service. Earlier versions of Warhammer 40k had giant decks of individual cards for the more than thirty armies you can play, and you had to interact with these cards using a special player currency, and that's how you did stuff because that's just how you were doing stuff. They put all those card abilities on the individual units now and the game is more fun. Read above: I understand what they can do and they can offer. But I do think they are baroque - somewhere between tradition and kink. (CW)TB out.",
