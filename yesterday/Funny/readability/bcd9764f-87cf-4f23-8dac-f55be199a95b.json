  "description": "No matter how great the workplace environment is, a single irritating employee can ruin it for everyone. Just think about it. Have you ever come into the office and plopped down in your desk, only to be followed by a colleague who has a question for you first thing in the morning. They're wondering why they can't get into their email. Well. Okay. Instead of doing your actual job, you now have to help this guy figure out his email situation. So you start looking at his laptop and see that he's logged out of his email for some bizarre reason. You ask him his password, and he pulls out one of those little notebooks where you write in your passwords by hand. Then he flips through it for ages while you stand there, bored out of your mind. These people also have coworkers who are just so inept, so technologically illiterate, or so frightfully dim that everyone around them is pulling out their hair. If there's someone in your office who prints out their emails, they belong on this list. One person mentioned that they know someone who only writes in Excel, instead of Word, because that's the program they're most familiar with. Whatever works, I suppose, but in the end, they're just wasting company time and burning through the patience of everyone around them. Next, read about this woman who threw a party with one rule: no children allowed, please. Guess which friend showed up with a 3-year-old in tow anyway and \"used her child to get her way?\"",
