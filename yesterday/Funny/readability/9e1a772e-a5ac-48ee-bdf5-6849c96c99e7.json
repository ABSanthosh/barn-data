  "description": "Gaining a feral cat's trust is a difficult thing to do. Not every street cat is as cute as those ones who run up to you and thank you for every bit of attention. Some of them are tougher cookies. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't try. It's a good thing we're crazy cat people though. We don't have to explain to our ICHC audience that they should try to pet every street cat that they see, because y'all already do it. So you know that some cats take longer to trust humans, and you know why it's worth it to gain their trust anyway. It's because moments like these can happen. Two years it took for this cat to let this human pet it. Two whole years. And it was worth every moment of it. Because when this cat needed help - when he needed someone to save it, he knew exactly who to go to. He knew who was kind to him and who was not. And because of that - because of all the hard work that was put in to gain this cat's trust, now, he has a loving, warm home to live in.",
