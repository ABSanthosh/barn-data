  "description": "Hey friends, gather 'round for a beautiful and unexpected tale from the always-mysterious cat distribution system. Last year, the original poster adopted a sweet mama cat from a local family who claimed she was on \"cat birth control pills.\" But just three days later, during a vet visit for what was supposed to be a routine spay appointment, came the surprise, she was pregnant.Less than a month after settling in, she gave birth to two kittens. While only one little orange fluff made it, his presence has filled the home with joy ever since. He's lovingly referred to as \"my orange guy\" and has fully settled into his forever home, even being accepted by his feline sister. Mama cat was spayed soon after, and her orange kitten was neutered when the time came.And here's the magical part. The first kitten, who sadly did not survive, was gently buried beneath a cherry tree in the garden. Not long after, a huge sunflower bloomed right above the spot, a quiet, beautiful reminder of love and life. What began as a simple adoption turned into a story of surprise, healing, and a tiny orange kitten who changed everything.",

Quite the surprise. She gave birth to only two kittens less than a month after I adopted her. Sadly, the first one was stillborn. He or she was orange as well, completely orange, actually. We named the stillborn kitten “Sylvester” and buried him next to a cherry tree in our garden. Later on, a huge sunflower appeared right above his grave. I still have pictures.By the way, Mama was spayed not long after giving birth, and her living son, my orange guy, is now neutered.\" He looks like he's always up to something. How does OP manage to sleep at night?",
