  "description": "Any employee preparing for a bump-up on the corporate hierarchy knows that a promotion isn't a promotion unless you have the supplemental compensation to prove it. Sure, a new title to slap on the ol' resume and more responsibilities to fill your time during the workday is nice, but you don't want to be doing any extra work if you're not seeing an appropriate payout along with that. Your labor is not free… Any boss that tries to convince you otherwise is just trying to save that money for their own pockets and actively engaging in toxic workplace practices.In this next story, an employee is left humiliated after their boss \"promotes\" them to a new title with more responsibilities but fails to give them a compensation raise or new benefits. Hey, that new job title is going to come in handy when they're back on the job hunt for a boss who won't take their time and effort for granted. Scroll to read.",
