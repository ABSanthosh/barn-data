  "description": "If you're working in a place that's understaffed, there's a good chance that management will make excuses about how they're hiring for the position, but though those positions stay indefinitely open and people apply to them, you can't help but notice: no one ever gets hired to the role.Meanwhile, more staff are experiencing burnout from the increased workload or just leaving for greener pastures, turnover is escalating, and now what was once a five-person team is down to two—and that's just in your department.Now you're doing the work of three or four other people and struggling to keep up despite working overtime (likely unpaid) and breaking your back to please your employer. Ask for a raise for the extra and exceptional work you've been doing, you're going to get denied. They're not going to recognize your additional efforts, contributions, or abilities. The point here, after all, is to save money by reducing staffing.",
