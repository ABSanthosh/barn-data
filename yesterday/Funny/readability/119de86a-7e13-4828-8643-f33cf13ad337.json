  "description": "Workplaces have a remarkable talent for blurring the line between professional and personal life until it barely exists at all. In the modern employment circus, management's solution to every problem is to treat employees' time, privacy, and sleep schedules as communal property, ripe for the taking whenever a scheduling crisis hits. The idea of a day off becomes a quaint relic, and the expectation that workers should be reachable at all hours is baked into the culture, as if everyone secretly lives in the break room and dreams in company slogans.",

  "text": "In the age of the boundary-free job, missed calls are interpreted as a personal challenge, and unreturned texts are grounds for escalation. The concept of rest is treated as an obstacle to be overcome, not a basic human need. Managers, emboldened by a shortage of staff and an excess of entitlement, see no issue in dispatching coworkers on door-to-door missions, turning the neighborhood into an extension of the workplace. The message is clear: living nearby is not a convenience for you, but a golden ticket for them to interrupt your sleep, your downtime, or whatever shred of personal life you have left. The only thing more persistent than workplace emergencies is the belief that every employee should be on standby, ready to spring into action at the faintest whiff of a scheduling hiccup.",
