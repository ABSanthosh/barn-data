I mean, everyone loves Kathy. Plus, I really think she still has a lot more to say about how her sense of self has changed with age.” According to reports, Love later decided to hedge the publication’s bets by putting Jon Bon Jovi on the cover of the issue after this one and then returning to Bates for the next six issues after that.
