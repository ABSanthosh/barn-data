  "description": "We cannot stress this enough–employment is a two-way street. Both job candidates and hiring managers should go about the job-hunting process with that in mind. Both of them should be considered the interviewers, especially since the position should fit both sides, not just one. This directly means that if hiring managers cannot treat their candidates with the respect they deserve, they should not be hiring anyone in the first place.Unfortunately, just as interviewers find themselves meeting with many candidates who do not fit the company, job seekers also end up meeting with a lot of companies that do not fit them. You can go through hundreds of job interviews before you find the right one for you, including some interviews that are less than respectful, to say the least.The job candidate in the story down below experienced this recently, when they got to their job interview only to find out the interviewer was not there. The company thought it was no big deal that the candidate came all this way only to be told they will reschedule the interview.",
