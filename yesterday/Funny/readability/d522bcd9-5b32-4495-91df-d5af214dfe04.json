I’m still trapped in moving hell and my computer was lost in the gazillion unopened moving boxes but this afternoon it turned up and so I am writing this in the middle on the night to tell you that I am still here and I’m just fine aside from the light concussion I gave myself a few days ago when I was sleeping on the couch (since my bed frame had been taken to the new house) and at 3am I woke up to the sound of Hunter S. Thomcat loudly drinking out of a giant glass of ice water I’d left beside me, so I went to dump it in the kitchen sink but I kept the lights off so I wouldn’t wake up all the way and that’s why I didn’t see the dangerously low-hanging chandelier that normally hangs over the now-missing kitchen table and that’s how I ended up completely drenched in a gallon of icey water and cat backwash as I was unexpectedly punched in the head by my own home, which is exactly the opposite of how to stay asleep. I’m not sure any of this makes sense but in my defense, it’s very late and I have been concussed by a light fixture that I didn’t even like. Although, now that I’m thinking about it…I could use your opinion. When we first moved in to our old house I didn’t like this chandelier and was going to change it out but then I got distracted for 12 years. Now that I have to get the house ready to sell I was thinking I should replace it with something less…I don’t know…jestery? Medieval? But the real estate agent said I should leave it because it’s lovely and now I can’t tell if I’m insane. What’s your vote on this? Hideous or lovely? Post navigation",
