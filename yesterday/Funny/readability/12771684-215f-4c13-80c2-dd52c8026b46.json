  "description": "We know that people say that cats are independent creatures who like their space and their alone time. We know that cats are not always known for being the friendliest. We know that cats don't always have the easiest time connecting with others. We know it. We just haven't seen it many times. Seriously. In our experience, cats bond with humans or other animals incredibly hard and fast. Maybe they are not the most social creatures, but cats sure do love their cuddles. And when cats lose someone that they love, someone that they are close to, one of those creatures that they have bonded with… they certainly feel that loss very strongly. All that love that they have to give - and there is a lot of it - needs a place to go. And that's certainly true for the kittens in this story - both of them. Both orphaned, one losing its brother too… they found one another and connected because they were meant to. And although they are not biologically related, these kittens will be siblings for life.",
