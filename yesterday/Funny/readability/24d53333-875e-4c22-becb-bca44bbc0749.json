  "description": "We have a confession to make, feline fam…we finally went and adopted a Maine Coon cat. We have wanted one all of our lives, and we finally did it. There is just something so meowgical about these majestic fluffy felines. They are more like living room lions than they are cats, but snuggly ones. We have definitely seen some noticeable differences between this awwdorable Maine Coon kitten and our previous kittens, like fur example, this kitten is very active. Like, hyperactive. He always wants to play…all the time.Since we've got Maine Coons on our mind, we thought it would be nice to collect a stunning series of marvelously meowjestic and regal Maine Coon cats, but in their giant kitten form. Yes, they are even large as kittens. He barely fits in two hands…and he's only a few months old! Scroll down to see these purrfect pictures of pawdorable cats, you know you can't resist floofy kittens. At least, we can't!",

All he wants to do is claw at our toes while we're trying to sleep and then randomly sleep on our faces in the middle of the night. Yes, we wake up a mouth full of cat hair, but it's totally worth it. This isn't our kitty, but he did look a lot like this when we first got him. He was so small! That changed quickly. Now he's purractically the size of our forearm and he just keeps growing. You look away for once second and he grows at least a whole inch!",
