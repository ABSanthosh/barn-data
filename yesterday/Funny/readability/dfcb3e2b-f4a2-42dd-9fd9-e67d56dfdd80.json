  "description": "Job applications get old real fast. The worst are the ones that require you to upload your resume, then, when you click to the next page, they ask you to reenter everything. You need to type in when and where you went to school, the dates of all your jobs, your job titles and job descriptions, and more. You have to retype every little thing, and there's no way around it if you want to apply to jobs!Another more recent thing that's been getting on people's nerves is having to do recorded video interviews. Instead of talking to a person face to face, people are now asked to talk into a camera, alone in a room. They have to answer questions, often in 1-3 minutes, and sometimes, the company won't even allow you to rerecord your answer! Other people have the opposite problem, and they keep rerecording their answers until they feel it's perfect enough to submit, which can take hours. Check out a bunch of these unfortunate job applications below! Next, read about the gift givers who are just awful at giving presents, like one person who gave someone a regifted half-empty bottle of perfume and called it \"vintage.\"",
