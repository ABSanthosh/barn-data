  "description": "No one enjoys getting assigned a new task at work right before the end of the day. The reality of the matter is that most tasks can wait until tomorrow at that point, and if it cannot, then that's on management for holding off on assigning said task for so long.This story serves as yet another example of how communication within a strict corporate hierarchy can lead to bad business. Here, we have an employee who was asked to complete a task at 4:50 pm that was evidently urgent. This would be frustrating on any given day, but the fact that this happened on the precipice of a long holiday weekend only makes it so much worse. Thankfully, this dude had enough self-confidence to stand his ground and inform his boss that he would not be staying late under any circumstances. That's what you get, management!For more stories like this, check out this post about how management accused an employee of trying to sabotage the company.",
