  "description": "As a gamer myself, and having lived with other gamers, once that mechanical keyboard gets clacking and the team call-outs start rolling in intense moments, it's going to be noisy for everyone else around you. With absolute certainty, when you're intently focused on something, you underestimate the amount of noise you're making. In the early hours of the morning, these sounds are amplified by the relative quiet of the world around us.And when you add paper-thin walls to the equation, you're going to end up with some pretty irate and sleep-deprived neighbors and roommates. Most people will wait until they're at the absolute shreds of sanity before saying anything, too.I once had a roommate who was otherwise great but would noisily play a team based game in the early hours of the morning on his gaming PC that he had cleverly situated in the room directly above mine. Needless to say, the noise-canceling headphones he wore didn't. He would always be apologetic before doing the same thing again the following night.The bottom line is that late-night noises are probably a lot louder than you think, and regardless of what your personal schedule is when you live with or adjacent to other people, there's definitely a moral responsibility not to upset their more socially accepted schedule.",
