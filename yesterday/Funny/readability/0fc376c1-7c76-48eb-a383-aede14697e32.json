  "description": "Don't worry, the season of work holiday parties is almost over. But with them have come some seriously juicy coworker drama that we get to unpack. Work parties typically boast about free food, questionable dance moves from upper management, and—if you're lucky—a holiday gift worth bragging about. But every now and then, someone shows up with an agenda. Like this entitled coworker who treats the holiday party like a personal shopping spree.In most workplaces, gift exchanges are a lighthearted affair. You cross your fingers, hope for a decent gift card or maybe some yummy Christmas cookies, and call it a day. Well, this office decided to do a raffle instead of the traditional gift exchange. And for one newlywed coworker, this party wasn't about holiday cheer. It was about recouping wedding costs. After spending months talking about her extravagant destination wedding (complete with a cash donation option instead of a registry), she arrived at the party ready to stake her claim on the biggest prizes.",

She had already prepped all of her coworkers with some sob story about how the gifts they received from their wedding was barely enough to furnish their apartment. PSA: your wedding guests are not supposed to furnish your entire place, especially if you have two apartments, like this bride. But heaven forbid when another employee won one of the items she had her eye on. What followed was a serious case of entitlement, strategic trades, and sheer determination to leave with as many top-tier prizes as possible. And she did not leave empty-handed.
