  "text": "He’s watched ScarJo kiss Jonathan Bailey multiple times during ‘Jurassic World: Rebirth’ premieres Scarlett Johansson has had to suffer through numerous jokes about her marriage to Colin Jost while Jost has been the host of Saturday Night Live’s Weekend Update. Any time Jost and Michael Che do a joke swap, Johansson catches a stray. So, it feels just that for the last few red carpets for the global premiere of her new film Jurassic World: Rebirth, she’s been smooching her costar Jonathan Bailey. The kisses are totally innocent — friendship kisses between friends, really. Bailey is an out gay man who told Entertainment Tonight that kissing a friend hello is one of life’s simple pleasures. “I believe in being able to show love in all different ways,” Bailey explained. “And if you can’t kiss your friends … life’s too short not to.”  Don't Miss Still, it’s kind of fun that Jost is having to answer questions from reporters about another man kissing his wife in front of the world, and him. I mean, Johansson had to sit and give a reaction to Jost’s meatloaf vagina joke on live television. Jost told Entertainment Tonight that Bailey “didn’t seem like the biggest threat” but made an on-theme joke. “I guess in Jurassic Park terms, the attack always comes from the raptor you never thought was there. Of all the threats out there, I wasn’t thinking it was Jonathan.” He added that he’s not too worried about it all. “I think it’s going to be ok,” he continued. “People really blow it out of proportion when people kiss their friends hello.” “Jonathan and I were at a red carpet and were like, ‘I guess we have to kiss now? Close the loop?’” Jost told the ET reporter. The interviewer then suggested that the situation might make its way into SNL’s 51st season. “I sense that perhaps with Michael Che it could happen,” Jost said. “But I don’t need to get back into it.” I personally support an embargo on any sketches involving Jost’s personal life ever gracing Studio 8H again, but if we’re gonna do a friends-kissing sketch, at least let us bring in Bailey for it.  At the end of the day, the kisses are a non-starter. But it’s nice to see a Hollywood couple having a bit of fun with their fame. The marriage is made up of two people who are pretty supportive about the other’s work. Johansson laughs at Weekend Update jokes. Jost is the second person to lock lips with his wife on red carpets. It’s symbiotic, even if Johansson is pulling a little bit more weight by laughing at all of those Weekend Update jokes.  Tags: News Scroll down for the next article Must Read SIGN UP FORA WEEKLYNEWSLETTER OF JOKES + TRIVIA",
