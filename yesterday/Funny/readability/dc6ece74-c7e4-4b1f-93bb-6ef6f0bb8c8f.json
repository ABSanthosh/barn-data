  "description": "Good meowrning, feline fam. There are a few things that can get us out of bed in the morning without fail: the smell of a pot coffee warming up, the sound our cats make right before they share last night's dinner with the living room rug, and the smell of freshly cooked cat memes. True, the first two have more of a visceral reaction, but a new batch of cat memes just fills our hooman souls with joy because we know, without a doubt, that we will be smiling and giggling all meowrning long.That's why we like to start our day by kissing our cats (yes, it's necessary) and enjoying at least 20 feline funnies before 9 AM. 19 is too little, we don't have that much time in the morning to scroll through more than 30 - so 20 is the sweet spot for meme consumption. Grab a cup of coffee to enjoy while purrusing these memes because your meowrning both fine and feline!",
