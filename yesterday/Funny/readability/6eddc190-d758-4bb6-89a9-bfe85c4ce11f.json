  "description": "As children, we waited for the day we could live in a place of our own without our parents breathing down our necks and dictating what we could and couldn't do. Being a child means abiding by your parents' rules. Fine, I'll take it. Once we move out, however, it's free reign. We can throw parties, have potential romantic partners over for a candlelit dinner, and walk around in any kind of clothes we want. Living alone is beautiful for a multitude of reasons. That's why sacrificing our bachelor(ette) pads is so difficult when family needs to stay with us for a while. When said family starts acting like they own your house, especially when they're not paying anything to live under your roof. In this next story, a 27-year-old woman decides to start charging her stepdad rent after he tries to start dictating what she wears and when her boyfriend can come over \"their\" house. The daughter makes it known that she's had enough of his tyranny.",
