I'm not certain we've achieved true enshittification but there is a lot of shit on there now and it's wigglin' 25/8. This stuff is so weird. The model for all of this software as a service shit is predicated on vast injections of alien resources so they don't even have to make sense on their own. Like a lot of people, we used to have a Ventrilo or a Snapsound or a… Ear… Man. You know what I mean. This is the kind of thing a friend sets up and people say they're going to help pay for it and don't, leading to rancor. Ask me how I know. This and other challenges are the domain of Discord. It didn't one hundred percent make sense that you could have all of that shit for free, because at least in your own experience Kiko is paying it - whoever your longsuffering version of Kiko is. So everybody switches to it. Then, and only then, do they actually have to be a company in any way we might fathom. So now there's shit all over the place, twinklin', people I've never seen before are doing whippets in the hall, but now they are trying to place some kind of geas on me to undertake mythic quests in exchange for a currency they just made up slash a border for your PFP that… only lasts two months? Do they rot or something? Like, the images? If so, I'm gonna have to reconsider some of my fundamental assumptions. (CW)TB out.",
