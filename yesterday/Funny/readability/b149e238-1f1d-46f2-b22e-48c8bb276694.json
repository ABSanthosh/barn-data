And try not to be disgusted overmuch by the greasy and wicked levitator floating in Panel 2. This vile beast, the Cheesesteak Fairy, earned more than ten gees for Child's Play if you can believe it. The ritual involves holding the mascot hostage until the audience ponies up, and thus far this mercenary tendency has served the teens very well.",

And try not to be disgusted overmuch by the greasy and wicked levitator floating in Panel 2. This vile beast, the Cheesesteak Fairy, earned more than ten gees for Child's Play if you can believe it. The ritual involves holding the mascot hostage until the audience ponies up, and thus far this mercenary tendency has served the teens very well. The show was pretty wild in a way that is hard to contextualize. We had some hard hitting fucking collabs: an official Lance Pack with Catalyst for our Black Remnant series, essentially a curated box of stompy robots, sold out almost before I could tell people to go grab it. I will admit that I may have played a mean trick with my selections for this box - I scoured every online community focused on Battletech months and months ago, looking for beloved hardware that people wanted in new sculpts. Their fantasy picks, as much as I could. And then, I advocated fiercely for their inclusion. Hopefully people feel well served by the Cyclops - my personal warhorse in the new campaign - along with the Dragon Fire, the Flashman, and the Blood Asp. No Black Knight this time, though I tried! If you got one, nice. If not, and you're excited for one or more of these steel gentlemen, there are a ton of them on a boat bound for the U.S. and they'll enter the retail channel next month. Dire Wolf also dropped the sequel to our last project we worked on with them at the show - Clank! Legacy 2: Acquisitions Incorporated - Darkest Magic.  The box was very heavy, and I commend the brave souls who bought this monolith and tried to bring it home from Unplugged. It floods my sensorium with Christmas Feelings whenever I think about a squad cracking into it over the holidays. Don't forget to grab their Game Shelf app on a phone or for your laptop - it has a fully voice acted experience for the Book of Secrets along with a digital campaign tracker, and I think it'll make things even more fun. PAX Unplugged sold completely out of tickets this year, which is certainly what you hope for. But it also felt really, really good. Is there some connection?! (CW)TB out.",
