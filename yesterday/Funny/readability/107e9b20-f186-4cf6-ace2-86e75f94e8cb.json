  "text": "Hello and welcome to the FIFTEENTH ANNUAL James Garfield Miracle! (HOW??) “What is the James Garfield Miracle?” you may be asking. You must be new here. HELLO AND WELCOME. 15 years ago I walked into an estate sale and fell in love with an ancient taxidermied boars head that seemed so damn happy to see me. I did not buy him and spent a week in light mourning. Then the next week A MIRACLE HAPPENED and James Garfield came into my life forever. (He’s looking at me right now, in fact and he is still magnificent.) But Victor wasn’t completely thrilled that we’d spent $90 on a literal Christmas miracle of mangey fur and missing teeth so I decided that I’d make holiday cards of James Garfield to make up for it and if I sold a couple dozen it’d be like James Garfield was making us money. But then everyone went crazy and James Garfield made more that week than I did in my actual job and so I decided that I’d take all the money James Garfield made and use it to give presents to the kids of people who were struggling that year because I have been there in the past myself. And I bought gifts for the first 30 something people and then I ran out of money but then suddenly everyone in the comments were like, “I WANT TO HELP A STRANGER IN NEED! LET ME BUY A GIFT FOR SOMEONE” and that’s how this suddenly became 15 years of a strange community project of strangers helping strangers anonymously and it’s pretty damn amazing. Over the years we’ve had many different iterations of the James Garfield Miracle and the only real downside is that occassionally a scammer would slip in and ask for stuff for themselves, so a few years ago we decided to just give out teddy bears. Why? Because everyone loves teddy bears (hell, I love teddy bears) and if someone is going to go to the trouble to make an entire wishlist account for a teddy bear they definitely need one. So this year I am sending out 100+ teddy bears to kids right here.  That’s it. Just sweet, snuggly teddy bears. Well, not just teddy bears because the teddy bears have eyes that babies can swallow (stop swallowing eyes, weird babies) so I’m also adding a few other stuffed animals you can choose from if you have an eye-devouring baby or your child hates bears or Amazon sells out of teddy bears.  But that’s it. Simple. Easy. Not perfect because in a perfect world everyone would get everything they need, but I’d like to imagine that even people who may be disappointed that we’re just doing stuffed animals will at least be happy imagining all the kids finding unexpected fluffy new stuffed animals in their arms this holiday. It makes me smile, at least.  So, if you are struggling this year and you need help getting your child a present for Christmas/Hanukkah/winter solstice/whateveryoucelebrate then I am ready to Santa Claus it up and drop one lovely plushie at your doorstep. And I will walk you through how to get one anonymously.  Here are the links for the plushes you can pick from. Hailey picked them out because they are still kid-adjacent and knows what kids like. Choose the one that best works for your kid: Gund Pink Bunny Stuffed Penguin Bluey and Bingo set Gund pandacorn (or llamacorn, caticorn, corgicorn) Stuffed lobster  Goose/Duck Otter 15.7 inch Puffer Fish  Heated bubble-tea plush Light-up teddy Currently these are all around $10-$20 each but Amazon can be wonky about changing up the prices when things start to run low so if I see that happening I’ll come back here to add other choices to choose from to replace any that sell out or suddenly skyrocket in price from $20 to $180. (Wtf, Amazon?) If I haven’t bought you a stuffy it’s probably because they sold out, jacked up the price, or you forgot to add your address so just come back and try again.  (Also, I use a lot of the profits I make on ads and stuff to buy toys for kids, and all of the royalties from the 2025 Bloggess Calendar go to this as well, so that means that if you’ve even clicked on a link this year or bought an ad or a book, then you are the reason why I’m going to be able to buy toys for at least 100 kids this year.  I’m so grateful.  Thank you!) The wishlists should be posted in the comments so (as always) if you want to buy a present for a stranger you totally can.  Or you can donate to Project Night Night, an amazing organization that provides a tote bag, book, stuffed animal and security blanket to displaced kids throughout the year.  They are FANTASTIC and they have more requests than they can fill so I cannot recommend them enough. In fact, this afternoon I donated $1000 to them in your name. WHOOP! SO…if you want in on this you have to read all the directions and stick to the rules or otherwise you will be set on fire and pushed out a moving plane.  Or maybe I’ll just delete your comment and look at you with that disappointed look your mom gives you when she knows you’re trying but are still fucking up.  One of those.  Here are the rules: IF YOU WANT TO GIVE: Okay, how do I do this? You are my special angel.  Just look in the comments and find someone who has an unfilled Wishlist. I’m going to fill least 150 stuffed animal wishes but there are always more than I can handle.  (If there’s nothing on their list when you click it it means their toy was already bought- yay!)  Buy their present and make sure when you check out that you select their shipping address instead of defaulting to yours.  (It won’t give you their full address but it’ll tell you the town you’re shipping it to so you can compare it to their comment to make sure you have the right person.)  If you try to fill a wishlist but it doesn’t give you a shipping address to choose that means the person didn’t assign a shipping address to their list so just delete their present out of your cart and go on to the next wishlist.  If it says “these are duplicates.  Someone else may have already bought this” when you try to check out then someone else has already bought that stuff so delete it and try another one. I’ll update the comments as I can to note which ones have been filled but it can get a bit backlogged when I’m in the car or sleeping. 🙂 Please do not fill any wishlists that don’t say the city the person lives in the comments, or any wishlists where the person doesn’t stick to the rules, please. (This is one way we make sure that people are who they say they are while still giving them anonymity.)  But what if I don’t live in America? Check the comments because we often have Canadians and others outside the US who need help and I can’t fill those lists because shipping kills me, so if you want to adopt a family this is a great way to do it. IF YOU NEED HELP: You are my special angel.  Here are the things you have to know and if you do them wrong you’ll get deleted so read carefully, okay?:   You have to make a BRAND NEW wishlist today, you can only choose one stuffed animal per child to put on your wishlist, and it has to be one of the ones above. I’ll walk you through it below. Then just come to this post and leave a comment telling us the city and State you’re in (this location has to match what you have on your wishlist), how many kids you have, and a link to your wishlist.  Do not make multiple wish lists.  Just make one.  One of the most important things (people do this wrong every year so PLEASE do this part right) is that you have to assign a shipping address for this specific brand new wishlist.  It doesn’t matter if you’ve done it before or think it’s on your profile. You have to do it for this new wishlist specifically today or it won’t work. I’ll give you the details on setting up the wishlist below. What if I want to make wish lists to surprise other people who I think need help? Nope.  Because then we end up sending multiple things to the same people. But you can totally encourage them to go online and make their own. This is for anyone struggling to get a toy for their child this holiday (and yes, that totally includes teens and adult children with special needs). I’ve never done this before.  How do I make a wishlist? It’s pretty quick and easy if you follow the formula.  I’ll walk you through step by step: On Amazon, click on “Accounts \u0026 Lists” (on the top right), choose “lists” and then on “Create a list”. Name it “James Garfield 2024” then click “create”. This will give you a blank private wishlist with nothing on it.  On the right you’ll see something that says “…More“.  Click on that and choose “Manage list.”  Change “private” to “PUBLIC” so we can see it. In the “description” part just put how many kids your list is for.  YOU MUST ADD YOUR ADDRESS FOR THIS SPECIFIC LIST so click on the drop-down for the shipping address and change it from “none” to your address. PLEASE DON’T SKIP THIS PART.  Please make sure that the checkboxes “keep purchased items on your list” and “don’t spoil my surprises” are NOT checked.  Now go back and double-check every single thing in this paragraph. Is it all good? Awesome! Click “Save changes”.  Now just go pick one of the above stuffed lovies for your kiddo.  When you have the one you want click on the “Add to list” drop down arrow on the right (it’s under where the price is) and then select your “James Garfield 2024” list.  Click “view your list” to make sure it’s added. If everything is right you should have your stuffed animal(s) on the wishlist page and when you click on the “…more” button it should say that your wishlist is public and your address should show up in the “…more” box and double check that “don’t spoil my surprises” and “keep purchased items on your list” ARE NOT checked. (People will see the city and state you are in, but your last name and the rest of your address is hidden.) If you have another kid just go back to the list and pick a present for them and add it to the same list. Copy the link to your wishlist. Now you go to the comments below and leave a comment saying how many kids you have, what city and state you are in, and a paste in the link to your wishlist.  That’s it! So for example, I would say, “Hi.  I live in San Antonio Texas, and I have one kid who would love a kitty. Here’s my list:  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/VH9X1VPXAPA8/ref=nav_wishlist_lists_2 Thanks!” Now…to go shopping.  Happy James Garfield Day! PS.  Please please please double check before you hit the submit button that you have assigned a shipping address to your wishlist, that it’s “public” and that your comment has a link to your wishlist, the city and state you live it and the number of kids you have. Love! PPS. This is one of my favorite things to do each year but it isn’t perfect. Every year some boxes go missing. Some get delivered after Christmas. Miscommunications happen. But I’d rather try to do something small and wonderful even if it isn’t perfect. Thank you to every single person who asks for help, to every single person to who helps and especially to those who have done both. Every year we have people who’ve been helped before who are so happy to help this year, or people who’ve helped before but now need help themselves. I know what it feels like to be in both of those places and I’m wishing love and light to every single person who reads this. PPPS. When you choose something for your wishlist make sure it still says “delivers before xmas” because some of the things may sell out and not restock in time. 🙂 As of the time I’m writing this all the stuffed animals arrive before xmas but if they start to sell out and have to restock it might cause your stuff to come in later. Happy holidays, y’all!",
