  "description": "It's safe to say that a small number of people actually want to work for a living. If it was feasible, many folks would take to a life of leisure rather than get ready for the ol' 9-5 routine every weekday. Not to rain on anyone's parade, but this isn't how life works. Money (most of the time) does not appear out of thin air, and everyone works for a living to achieve some level of comfort or stability in their lives. Working is not \"embarrassing\", it's just the way life works. If someone in your family doesn't want a job because they deem themselves above that lifestyle, they should also be fine with having little to no income. If they expect you to front the bill for their beliefs, you have to nip that entitled behavior in the bud. For example, if your mother refuses to work (after having worked for years), you, as their child, have no obligation to help her with something that can be easily remedied. The daughter in this story is fed up with giving her mom money because of the lifestyle she chose to live with.",
