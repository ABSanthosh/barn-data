  "description": "There's always something when it comes to an in-office Christmas party. Whether your coworkers are cavalier about their likes and dislikes or they prefer to keep their dirty laundry to themselves, something is bound to happen when you put tired, overworked employees in a room and expect them to exchange thoughtful gifts.Even though the slightly villainous coworker in this story blew her top, what was going on in the office behind closed doors was even more insane. The original poster (OP) of the story accidentally spilled the beans on what the coworker, Karen, was to receive as her gift, a sassy mug that made a slight dig at her entitled character. Karen lost it and proceeded to tell the entire office about a hierarchal love affair that had been happening for months. needless to say, HR forgot about the Mug Gate, but Karen was in for a real talking-to after the fact. Scroll below to see the aftermath unfold.",

  "text": "A sassy mug was the workplace demise of this self-righteous “Karen”.Her obsession with gifts that hold high monetary value paired with the essence of her character did her no favors in this situation, shown in the way she reacted and aired out everyone's dirty laundry. Granted, what was said should have been out in the open, yes—but that should not have been her decision to make. But, when you're the “Queen of Everything,\" the executive decision to speak your mind might happen before you think twice about what your behavior might mean for everyone involved.",
