  "description": "This entitled teen's ego deflated faster than his popped tire when he disregarded his neighbor's demands. Turns out, trespassing on someone's land and in their flower garden gives them a tactical advantage for boobytrapped life lessons… Which is exactly what this rural gardener gave to the neighborhood bike terror. After months of tending a garden, it's encouraging to watch the buds flourish, sprouting new life in your yard and building a hobbyist's dream garden. However, that joy can be squashed in an instant by a rogue bike tire, destroying months—even years!—of hard work in the yard in a matter of seconds. Perhaps the next time this kid gets scolded by an avid gardener to steer clear of their flower box, they'll heed the warning and save themselves the trouble of losing an entire wheel at the hands of an errant, deliberate rusty nail.",
