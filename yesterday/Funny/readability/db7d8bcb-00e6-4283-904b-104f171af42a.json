  "description": "If you ask us, feline fam, there are too many cats out there that need saving. We wish to live in a world where each fluffy feline has a safe home to sleep in every night and where animal shelters would be a thing of the past. We're not quite there yet, but thanks to people like the one in this post, we're getting closer and closer every day. If you're looking for a new cat, please consider going to a shelter and adopting one. Get a kitten, get an adult, or even better yet, get a sweet senior cat that just wants to love you. While you're at it, take a chance and adopt one with special needs. It will be more work on your end, but the rewards you get are 100% worth it. That animal will be more grateful to you than you can ever imagine.That's exactly what happened to the caring hooman below - they adopted a two-year-old cat with health issues that no one wanted, and now they cuddle 24/7.
