  "description": "People who have never had cats in their lives have all kinds of misconceptions about them. People think that cats are aloof or that cats are mean, but that's not true. The vast majority of cats are neither of these things, and of the cats that do seem aloof or mean… there is usually a reason. If you treat a cat well, if you give them the love and respect and time that they need, usually, even the \"meanest\" cat will open up to you and show you affection. Today's story just reinforces this notion. A demon cat - that's what this poor little thing was called throughout his life. He was mean to everyone except for his owner and her husband. But once the owner passed and the cat was adopted by her sister, his real colors started to show. In that house, he was neglected sad, so he was \"mean\" to people. In his new house, he got the things that he truly needed, and just like that, he became the sweetest cuddle-bug .",
