  "description": "Everyone knows that when a new resident moves into the neighborhood, you should expect a few weeks of noise and a lot of disturbance. Not because those new neighbors are necessarily noisy people, but because new neighbors love to make repairs on their new house. They want to repaint the roof, break down some doors, rebuild the back yard, and perform a variety of other construction jobs that usually bring noise along with them. And as you watch them to move in and bring all their belonging with them, while construction workers get settled in their new site for the next few weeks, you start to consider booking a hotel room until they are done.If you think this is starting off on a bad note, if those neighbors are already acting entitled and are being mean to you, the situation can only get worse from there. They can get much more annoying if they wish to, so you should be careful with how you interact with them, or you might seriously regret it.",
