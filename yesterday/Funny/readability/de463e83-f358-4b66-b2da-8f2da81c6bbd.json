Gloomhaven is, as I said before, a kind of gamified advent calendar. I hope nobody takes that as an insult; I'm saying that because it's true and it's the coolest thing I can imagine. People sometimes talk about the amount of setup for an individual scenario and complain about that, but the initial setup for *haven games is something like an act of parental love you undertake for your friends. They will never know what you did for them and they don't need to. They don't need to know how dark it got, about three quarters of the way in. Sunderfolk puts all that in a windtunnel and it comes out smooth and you control it from your phone. Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles was excoriated for some of the same reasons as Sunderfolk is now, just with a zesty modern twist. First, I simply won't tolerate any F2:C2 hate on my timeline - I like this game so much I invented a custom truncation. First, this is the main theme so we're already several thousand points out of a maximum of ten. A manufacturing error could have corrupted the rest of the data on the disc and we're still in striking range of Goaty. But back then, it required that you use a Gameboy Advance or an SP as your controller. If you didn't have a GBA at the time, I gotta say: I'm gonna look askance. The cables were hard to find, but the experience of playing with your friends in this unique way was magical. If the negative case for Sunderfolk is that it happens to require a phone, I feel strongly that there's probably one very near to you. Hey! Gonna get down until noon or so for #Fridabe on some Murval Rurvals, there's a couple new skins and I understand that players' heads may now become quite large? Harrumph! I shall have to see this for myself. Join the expedition around 10:30 or so at the traditional venue. (CW)TB out.",
