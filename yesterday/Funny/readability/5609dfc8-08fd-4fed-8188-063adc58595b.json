  "description": "When you're in your teens and early 20s, your partner's little siblings are either the most annoying or coolest kids you know. Some of us probably even ended up like them more than our boyfriend or girlfriend, after the inevitable breakup. But no matter how much you like them or get along with them, there is going to come a point where they've been a tag-along one too many times, and you find yourself wishing that they could find something else to do so that you could spend some time with your spouse without them around.Still, it's kind of hard to tell your boyfriend's younger 15-year-old sister to get lost when she part-owns the house that you're trying to move into with your boyfriend. At that point, there are other considerations in play that you need to be mindful of. Sure, your boyfriend might be her guardian, but as such, you wouldn't be trying to kick any other minor who your spouse was responsible for out of their own home and should probably be approaching things with a more mentoring and caring mindset.That's the situation that this 15-year-old girl, who lives with her 25-year-old brother in the house that their late father left them, found herself in when she came into conflict with her brother's girlfriend, who seemed to be looking for ways to get her out of the house and out of the way. And we're not talking for the evening so that the pair could have a night together without the little sibling around, we're talking for good.It started with vague insinuations about how the 15-year-old should begin attending a boarding school before moving on to a university in a different city, clearly trying to clear the way so that she could move in. Frustrated, the teen shared her story with this online community wondering what she should be doing.",
