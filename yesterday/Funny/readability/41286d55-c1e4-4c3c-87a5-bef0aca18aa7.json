  "description": "The divvying up of the household duties will be an ongoing issue with the people you live with for your entire life. First with your siblings and parents, then roommates, then with your spouse or cats. Who does what, and how much and when will be a matter of constant ongoing debate, while it's important to keep in mind that everyone overestimates their own percentage of overall contribution and underestimates the contributions of others, it becomes readily apparent that some people just have a knack for not pulling their own weight.When you're a young adult living at home with your family, things can get a bit more complicated, there's this shifting dynamic both psychologically and realistically of you now being an adult yourself and finding your own way while still being under your parents' roof and wing. It's different from simply moving out when you're 18 or 19, in which case the dynamic of the relationship changes in a moment, since you're not seeing each other every day.",

And, well, when one party isn't understanding there is going to be conflict.When this young woman found herself on the hook for the brunt of the household chores, while her 18-year-old sister got away with basically nothing, putting everything onto the woman and their mother. After putting up with this behavior for a good while, enough was enough and the woman resolved not to pull her sister's weight or do anything for her any longer.This story strikes a balance of illuminating this difficult relationship dynamic, and of being taken for granted and standing up for herself to her family.",
