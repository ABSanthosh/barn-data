That being said… Ai is kind of scary. We're not experts on the topic, so we won't dwell on it. Just know we are team Human Creativity! And hi, hello, I'm an actual person writing this with my goopy 'ole brain. Seriously! Send me all the pictures of stoplights and I'll find them every time! Or a word with a different weird font for each letter, I can definitely still read it! (Probably… Sometimes those words are crazy looking!) Anyways, we found a story of a likeminded employee who got rewarded for having this same mentality! So, of course, we had to share it.  Go team Human Creativity!",
