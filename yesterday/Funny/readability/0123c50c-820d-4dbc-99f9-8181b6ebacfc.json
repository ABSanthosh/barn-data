  "description": "Workplaces managed to find a way to let their employees work remotely in the beginning of this decade. Now, that was necessary to ensure the safety of every employee that worked in close quarters with others. The explosion of remote work proved that a lot (if not all) of an employee's tasks could be completely remotely and be just as fruitful for the company they worked for.Many offices initiated an RTO (return to office) mandate to boost company morale. I won't act like I know if that truly makes a difference, but it's obvious that remote work is sought after by many folks in the workforce. There are pros and cons to remote work for sure, but the biggest pro is employee safety. When bad weather breaks out and you really don't want to use a PTO day, you can open your laptop and go about your daily tasks without difficulty.The southern US-based user who posted this next story doesn't particularly enjoy working from home, but they were hoping to get the green light from their manager when a freak snowstorm hit the area. Instead of getting the go-ahead, their boss told them if they don't want to come to the office, they are required to take a PTO day and the same goes for the rest of their department.The funny thing, though, is that other departments at the same company are allowed to work from home. Baffled, the user can't believe the company is willing to have their entire department go MIA instead of simply allowing them to work remotely and keep themselves safe off the road. I guess the company would rather sabotage employee output instead…",
