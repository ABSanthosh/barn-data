  "description": "Anybody out there who thinks that being a momma cat is easy because cats are \"independent\" is wrong. Being a cat momma is hard work. Because before your kittens get all independent… well, they need to be taught how to be independent. Kittens need to learn how to drink water from a bowl without getting it all up in their noses. Kittens need to learn how to communicate properly - so that they know exactly how to demand everything that they need from their human servants. Being a cat mom to one kitten is enough work. Hard work. But most momma cats don't give birth to just one kitten. It's usually around four kittens per litter, maybe six, depending on the breed of the cat. Eight is the most that we have heard of before. And yet, this momma cat has broken the record. The human who had rescued her thought that, after hours and hours of delivery, seven was going to be the end of it, but the next morning… they got a couple more surprises. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.
