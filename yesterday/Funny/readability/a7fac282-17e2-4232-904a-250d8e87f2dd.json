All of your loved ones come together for an event you have spent months creating and planning for to watch you vow your love to the one person who knows you better than you know yourself. Maybe you have a religious ceremony, or maybe your best friend officiates the wedding in a barn. Whatever the case, it's about what's best for you and your spouse-to-beThey also say the birth of your first child should be the most magical day in a person's life. A person you have spent months creating and planning for, someone who is quite literally an extension of yourself. Maybe you have a midwife, maybe you have ten doctors. Whatever the case, it's about what's best for you and your spouse and your newborn.",
