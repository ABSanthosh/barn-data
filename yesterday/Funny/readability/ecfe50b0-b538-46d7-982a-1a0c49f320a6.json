  "description": "No one enjoys being cut off, whether that's being cut off in the middle of a phone conversation or having your electricity cut off. Obviously, one of these scenarios is worse than the other, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do to make a point.Here, we have a 28-year-old daughter who helped support her father financially and recently had to call him about an upcoming electricity payment. However, her attempts to discuss this with her father were thwarted six times because he had this awful habit of ending phone conversations when he was done talking no matter what. He also was not the kind of guy who bothered responding to text messages or other forms of communication, so he was impossible to get a hold of as the deadline for this payment was approaching. So, after trying everything, the daughter decided to let the payment due date pass, thereby effectively cutting off her father's electricity all of a sudden. You can just imagine how he reacted to that.Keep scrolling below for the full story. For more stories like this, check out this post about som mildly infuriating movie theater encounters.",
