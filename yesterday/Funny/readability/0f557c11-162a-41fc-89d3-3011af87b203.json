  "description": "Siblings… Really, what is there that isn't to be said? They can be your best friends, your fiercest competitors, or just the most awful people you've ever had the displeasure of being acquainted with. This 25-year-old woman moved in with her 23-year-old sister, giving up her perfectly good apartment just to move in with her sister when her sister relocated to the city for work. Difficulties began to rise, and trouble brewed when her sister began performing \"harmless\" pranks. They started small with simple gaslighting and reorganization of belongings but escalated quickly to dangerous pranks, lighting items on fire, and even getting the woman arrested by telling neighbors that she was the sister's \"stalker.\"Not only is this sister being a terrible sister, by nature of their arrangement, but she's also being a terrible roommate, causing distress and actual danger to the person she's living with. The generation that was raised watching infuriatingly immature YouTube vloggers doing \"pranks\" for clicks on unsuspecting bystanders really needs to realize that you can't go around doing this in everyday life without serious consequences. And if pranks aren't fun and funny for everyone, they're really not funny at all—just annoying disturbances.",
