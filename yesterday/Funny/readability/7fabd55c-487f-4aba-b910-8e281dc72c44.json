  "description": "Have you ever wondered what your conversations would sound like if you were completely honest with the person standing in front of you? Or even how the world would look like if people truly spoke up and said what is on their minds?There are several funny skits online, and even an iconic movie about a world in which people cannot lie, and always tell the truth to each other. All to show just how easy, and slightly chaotic, the world could look like if we were all just a little bit more honest and open.However realistically, we do not live in a world where people simply say whatever they want. There are etiquettes and social rules in place, that are here to ensure we do not embarrass ourselves and others when we engage in conversation. Whether we're talking to colleagues, friends, family, or even hiring managers, there are some things you should keep to yourselves, even if it sounds extremely freeing to let it all go and speak your mind.",
