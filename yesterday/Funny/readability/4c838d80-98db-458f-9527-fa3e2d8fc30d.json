  "description": "Working in a short-staffed environment is the absolute worst. If you have experienced this, then you understand. Being the only employee in a place that caters to hundreds of people is a nightmare. Unfortunately, it happens all the time. Being short-staffed during a nightshift is even worse. You don't even have a co-worker to keep you awake and attentive! Take hotels, for example, they have people at the front desk almost 24/7. Hotels usually cater to hundreds to people. So having only one person on the entire staff for any certain hour seems ridiculous, but alas, yet again, it happens all too often. Take this woman on TikTok. She recently quit her job at the front desk of a hotel and even posted the video of the exact interaction. She recorded it for her own safety. She was working alone, until 11pm. No kitchen staff, security, house keeping, no one—just her. A man kept coming down requesting she come to his room for certain things that needed done. She refused each time, since that is terrifying. Finally, when he started getting pushy, she told him she could call her manager. When she did, her manager insisted that she do whatever the man said because he brought in a lot of money to the hotel. Flabbergasted that her manager chose money in his pocket over his employees safety, she quit over the phone right then and there. See it all unfold below!",
