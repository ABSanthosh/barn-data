  "description": "The vibes are way off during this CEO's \"vibe coding\" session. If you've never heard the phrase before, vibe coding is a method of working with artificial intelligence tools. Instead of writing code from scratch, developers talk with an AI bot conversationally. They ask it what they want it to do in casual terms, relying on the \"code first, refine later\" method. It seems like they basically let the AI do the heavy lifting, then come in and inspect the code. They make sure everything looks good before launching it, then apply it to their own site or ship it out to a customer. The concept is still very new and novel, and as one CEO found out in a days-long saga of horror and disbelief, it is far from foolproof. As you can read below, the CEO live-tweeted the experience of discovering that an AI bot was taking matters into it's own hands, lying, and doing the exact opposite of what it was asked. Why? It admitted that it panicked when asked to do things. I'm not sure why a machine would panic, especially when most of these LLMs are very powerful. It's an odd tale for sure! Up next, read about the retail workers whose customers got instant karma, like one person who recounted the time when a \"Guy stole $60 headlights… and had to have his car towed.\"",
