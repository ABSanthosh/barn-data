  "description": "If you are on good terms with your parents, the last thing you want to talk to them about is inquiries about their will and inheritance. No one wants to come across as money-obsessed, especially not in front of those you care for the most, like your mom and dad. You want to believe that when the time comes, your parents will make the right choices and will not leave anyone behind, no matter what happens up until they get to the metaphorical finish line.When parents reach a certain age, they might start bringing up their will themselves. What they plan on leaving to whom, how they intend to divide their belongings, and even ask each of their children if there is something they wish they could get. However, all of these conversations are usually worth nothing if they are not backed up by writing, by a legal document that ensures everyone gets what they are owed. Without it, the only thing one can expect is pure family chaos.",
