  "description": "If you are forced to rehome your cat, that is your time to say goodbye. There are no \"take-backsies\" after giving your fluffy feline up to another purrson that loves them.Rehoming a cat, and introducing them to a new household, is a daunting task. Cats, despite all of their stereotypes, are sensitive creatures and take a lot of time to adjust to new surroundings. It took one of our rescues three full months before she felt comfortable sleeping on the couch, or in her bed. The first couple of weeks, she hid under the bed. You have to give them their space to come to you.So imagine adopting a friend's rehomed cat, taking the time to introduce it to your own cat, and then falling in love with your new fuzzy feline. Then, five months later, the original owner comes back and demands their cat back! No thanks, this cat is ours now. Don't let the door hit you on the way out!
