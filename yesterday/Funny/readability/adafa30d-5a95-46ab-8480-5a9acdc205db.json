  "description": "Hey, shhhhhh! Did you hear that? That… \"Bing\" sound? Do you know what it was? It's a transfer of an orange brain cell completed. The single brain cell has successfully landed in the head of another orange cat. \"Bing\"! Now this orange cat will be exactly one brain cell smarter than he was before. Not that it's that much more, because all the orange cats share a single brain cell, being transferred to each of them on their turn.

Hooray!Because all orange cats share this one brain cell, they exhibit a specific orange cat behavior. Try as they might, they all behave in a very orange way. And what better way is there to explain the orange cats' behavior than the best orange cat memes of 2024? Orange cats might have tried to get smarter in 2024, but they only got oranger. Maybe 2025 will be their year?",
