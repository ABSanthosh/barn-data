  "description": "One of the most absurd things that we hear people say about cats is that they do not care about anyone or anything other than themselves. Silly. Ridiculous. We know. But somehow, people still believe it. So, we are here, once again, to attempt to show these people reason. It can't be that cats \"don't care\" if they do things like this - if they are so quick to take care of others as if they are their own kin. And this is not the first time that we have seen this happen. We have seen cats adopt kittens from other litters and treat them as if they are their own. We have seen cats adopt lynxes and raise them alongside their own babies. Even with humans, this is not the first time that we have seen a cat go out of its way to help them. Everyone knows, or should know, the story of Masha, the cat who saved a freezing human baby by wrapping around it in the snow all night, and in the morning, getting help and saving it. Cats care. It's fact.",
