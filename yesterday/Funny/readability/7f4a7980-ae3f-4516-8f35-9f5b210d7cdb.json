Here is the trailer for it; I don't watch a lot of broadcast television but this is a show that looks and feels like a pharmaceutical ad, which I suppose is at least somewhat on-brand. Unfortunately, I can't say anything else about the show because that will fuck up the comic. But! You can read the comic and then you'll know what I would have said. We were a little worried that the show might make the same joke, but once we saw the trailer we were like \"No, this is a serious time show for sads.\" #Fridabe returns, with the booster rocket of Marvel Rivals that lasts until noon, and then falls away to reveal the payload: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. We've played the game a few times already, and we have no idea what a Great Circle even is. But we don't actually care, because we knocked a nazi out cold with a viola. Come hang! (CW)TB out.",
