  "description": "Oh, cats. We love you. We love you so much. But why, why must you make it your life's mission to ruin any sense of Christmas spirit? You won't wear the cute sweaters that Grandma gave you. You won't let the Christmas tree stand for more than five minutes, you knock down all of our ornaments and wreaths, and yet….we still think you're just the cutest thing in the world. In fact, we should put you on top of the tree as the star because you're just daddy's purrfect little angel, aren't you?You know what? Cats and Christmas go together like us and chocolate cake - we just love it so much that we can't control ourselves around it. We don't knock over whole chocolate cakes whenever we see them, though, so that is one main difference. Anyway, we knew what we were signing up for when we got a cat, so at the very least, we have learned to laugh at it. Here is a catastrophic christmas compilation of humorous cats simultaneously ruining our holly-days and also being the stars atop our Xmas trees. If you can't beat them, join them!",
