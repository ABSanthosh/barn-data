Sure, let’s go with that. In fact, if my name sounds familiar at all, it’s probably just because the liberal media has slandered me. Now let’s get back to making America great again!” Chapman announced that he was excited to work with other recently released Proud Boys and recommended all of its members start by reading J.D. Salinger’s The Catcher In The Rye. Related Coverage",
