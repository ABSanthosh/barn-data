  "text": "Poehler left the show in 2008, but she also left one hell of an impression It’s been 16 years since Amy Poehler was a cast member on Saturday Night Live, but that also might be the exact same amount of time that’s passed since the average SNL “fan” actually watched it. From 2001 to 2008, Poehler carved a place for herself among the comedy greats with her powerful, high-energy performances on SNL, hosting the venerated “Weekend Update” segment and playing celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Michael Jackson. A veteran of the Chicago improvisational comedy scene who co-founded the comedy group The Upright Citizens Brigade that turned into one of the most influential training and performance institutions in entertainment, Poehler had an immense impact on her collaborators at SNL, namely her recurring current partner Tina Fey. During her tenure, Poehler also left an equally strong impression on the SNL fandom, who considers her not only one of the show’s all-time best cast members, but one of its current cast members as well.Variety recently spoke to Poehler shortly before they honored her with the Legends and Groundbreakers Award at the Newport Beach Film Festival this past weekend. During the conversation, Poehler revealed that, when fans approach her on the street, “Strangely, there are a lot of people who still think I’m on SNL. Which is great, honestly!” Don't Miss Yeah, I’m sure Lorne Michaels thinks it’s fantastic that those same people who are supposed to be SNL fans have at some point asked one of their nieces or nephews, “Who is Mikey Day?” Poehler clarified that, while the classic SNL admirers are certainly the most unusual fans who approach her on the street, it’s not the only reason she gets recognized. “I’ve heard from a lot of people, especially as Parks and Rec remains a big comfort show, about Leslie Knope,” Poehler explained. “But I think a lot of people resonated with Inside Out 2 this year. I’ve never had a project where more people texted me and said, ‘Oh my God, I just got out of that movie; it’s incredible.’”So, while Poehler is still one of SNL's biggest stars, SNL isn’t even one of her biggest projects. That seems like a bad sign. Although nostalgia has played a large part in SNL’s success since the 1980s, it’s not like anyone was going up to Chevy Chase during the Eddie Murphy years and telling him, “Can’t wait to see you Saturday!” Maybe the show could improve its contemporary cultural footprint if J.D. Vance could go out an give a disastrous and historically laughable interview for them to recreate — I’m sure Katie Couric would take that call.
