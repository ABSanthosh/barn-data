  "description": "Where to begin… The employers of healthcare facilities aren't always looking out for their employees' and patients' best interests. The same can be said for any other employer in every other field, but messing with the health of real humans' lives seems like a pretty messed-up thing to do, especially when you're treating an elderly population who are especially vulnerable.Messing with the essential workers who ensure that patients are receiving the best care they possibly can is another level of arrogance and malpractice. Where do we draw the line between casual understaffing and malpractice? There's no line to be drawn—they are the same thing in a setting like a nursing home.That's where this next story takes place, and an employee is running about how their nursing home is understaffed. Their employers insist they \"take\" their break without actually taking a break, so it looks like they gave them one, which is highly illegal. Even when the employee fights back, they tell her to take it easy and deal with it. Scroll below to read the story and what commenters have to say.",
