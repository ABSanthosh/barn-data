  "description": "When a couple who loves cooking starts living with a guy who can't cook anything, hilarity ensues! It sounds like the start of a goofy movie, but for this couple, it's their reality. Cooking seems awfully easy when you're just watching someone do it. How hard could it be to turn on the heat, throw some food in a pan, and make magic happen? Well, it's certainly more difficult than that, but this house guest didn't know. He's under the impression that he can cook, but it's becoming increasingly clear that he cannot even make eggs correctly. You can immediately tell if someone can cook or not just by observing them. Do they preheat their pan or oven? Can they tell if water is boiling just by the sound of it? Do they actually understand how to know if their food is cooking correctly, or if their meat is fully cooked? It's not hard to tell someone's experience level… but this house guest still felt fine with lying about it. At least the couple he's staying with will have some hilarious stories to tell for years to come! Up next, read some of the funniest things people have written to get themselves into college, like one person who revealed that \"I wrote a 750-word admissions essay describing the smell of baked potatoes... I got in.\"",
