  "text": "A combination of a very strong army choice, great rules, and a warrior's spirit has continued to see Gabriel's youngest terrorize the game table at home - sowing discord in the family unit. Not really! Gabriel is certainly more competitive than me, but being defeated by your child at something still feels like winning to a somewhat integrated person. That said, I would never undertake the actions seen here in a million years. For one, it would be like gettin' the whippin' switch. For two, that ain't my kid. That would be like getting beat by a literal fucking baby. I don't need his ass zipping all over the field, he's got enough horseshit already. Remember: these guys are sworn to the Lord of Decay. This isn't just like coughs and sniffles, this deity represents the very concept of illness - the cosmic aspect of withering and death. Hence, some of these diseases can be caught by things that ordinarily can't get diseases, like jeeps and shit. This is one of their artillery pieces. It's called a Mephitic Blight Hauler: You might be asking yourself:  wait.  Does that artillery piece have bones?  And...  scars?  And sores?  And a mouth, for some reason?!  The answers are Yes, Yes, Yes, and Yes.  And you are not the first to ask them! For a very long time, Dabe was working hard with a trusted ally to create next year's theme for PAX - one attendees of PAX Unplugged got a preview of at the end of the show. But now, he has returned, his vigor renewed, and he wants to leverage his skills in Marvel Rivals as a malevolent raccoon. Gabriel's Cloak \u0026 Dagger is on point, but he's been building a vicious Trickster God. I will also be there - in our traditional haunt, http://www.twitch.tv/pennyarcade, starting at 10am or so!
