Who counts, really? When it comes to cats math loses its meaning, 1 cat + 1 cat can sometimes be equal to 6 cats in total. It is known that cats constantly break the laws of physics, with them being liquid and all, but the laws of math also don't really apply to them.

Cat math is complicated.So we bring you here a bunch of cat memes that hold the power to spread joy.
