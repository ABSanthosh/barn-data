  "description": "I bet you thought Timothée was a shoe-in for \"Best Actor\"—well, the Academy said, \"no way!\" Nominated for his role as Bob Dylan in the beloved biopic A Complete Unknown, fans of the star and film critics alike are wondering why Chalamet didn't pull a win and take home Oscar gold for \"Best Actor.\" There are a lot of factors at play here, but we're thinking that he might be following in previous heartthrobs' footsteps—hear me out.Timothée Chalamet started young and was thrust into the limelight on an Oscar campaign trail for Call Me By Your Name when he was just 22 years old. His overall presence in the public eye, in addition to his multiple romantic partners of the past and present—Lily-Rose and Kylie Jenner—paired with fan reception/obsession, are eerily comparable to other cinema stars who have also seemingly never gotten it right in the eyes of the Academy awards.Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio, for two. Both were deeply loved by many in their heydays, yet always got the short end of the stick as Oscar nominees. Leo DiCaprio only won one Oscar after seven nominations, Johnny Depp has won none after three nominations, and Timothée has won none after two Oscar noms and four Golden Globe noms. Is he on the same trajectory, or is it too soon to tell? Getting the lead roles in the best movies might not be what it's cut out to be… Could his public image take part in the campaign against an Oscar win? Evidently, yes.",

  "text": "Some Skin in the Game, But Not EnoughA handsome face and a chiseled jawline can take you pretty far, but Timothée Chalamet also has undeniable acting talent under his belt. Having attended Fiorello H. Laguardia High School of Music \u0026 Art and Performing Arts in New York City, he’s no stranger to a script, some bright lights, and an audience of people who adore him. Chalamet had been in a handful of movies like Men, Women, and Children and Interstellar early on in his film career, but his breakout role was in Luca Guadagnino’s Call Me By Your Name, where he played a teen boy named Elio who falls in love with an older exchange student played by Armie Hammer. Since the film’s immense success both in the box office and in the hearts of new Chalamet fans, Timothée was set up to be one of the greats. Soon, you would see that jawline in every major film from Lady Bird, to Beautiful Boy, to Dune and more. Though Timmy dove head first into what would become a whirlwind of success and fame, he’s just not there yet for an Oscar. Vulture predicts Chalamet will win in 2027 because he’ll be 32 years old and “Oscar history suggests [that age] is when voters stop thinking of you as a ‘young actor.’” Having two Academy Award nominations before 30 years old is a feat in itself, and given the amount of movies he’s starred in within a nine-year span, he’s bound to win at least one Academy Award. Just like one of the biggest Oscar-snubbed actors in the last three decades, Leonardo DiCaprio.DiCaprio Started Young \u0026 was Just as GoodYes, Leo DiCaprio won “Best Actor” for his role in The Revenant in 2016, but what about his roles in The Aviator, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, or The Wolf of Wall Street? Though hardly an “Oscar-worthy” film, DiCaprio made his film debut in 1991 for Critters 3. It wasn’t until Leo picked up one of the lead roles in What’s Eating Gilbert Grape that he began picking up serious roles that boasted credibility and a level of sophistication the Academy loves to reward. Once Leo took on the roles of Jack in Titanic and Romeo in the contemporary interpretation of Romeo + Juliet, he became one of the top actors in the world solely based on fan reception and box office success. To this day, there are fan accounts dedicated to the actor that post fancam footage of him in the 90s. Long live the 90s king…What’s the deal with DiCaprio’s multiple losses then? Well, the Academy won’t ever explain it, so we’ll have to speculate. It comes down to having an actor who is so serious about their craft, but the media decides to sensationalize them rather than take them just as seriously. The Academy is known for its questionable choices, but giving an already beloved movie star their flowers over and over again is not in their wheelhouse—this isn’t Taylor Swift at the Grammys! DiCaprio has long gotten heat in the media for his choice in dating exceptionally young women relative to his age, and touchy drama like this can follow you into the doors of the Dolby Theater. Chalamet isn’t dating freshly-18-year-old women, but he recently developed ties with the Kardashian family by going public with his relationship to Kylie Jenner. More on that later… The infamous Oscar “Snub Club” is a group of actors and actresses who have yet to win an Academy Award for their stellar performances in their respective films. Though DiCaprio is not a part of the “Snub Club” any longer, his heartthrob image might have had something to do with his lack of Oscar gold during his heyday.1990s Johnny Depp was for 15-Year-Olds’ Bedroom Walls, Horror Fans, and That’s Kind of It…Johnny Depp’s film debut in A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) checked all the boxes for any teen’s favorite classic horror flick. The icing on the cake was a handsome, sweet Johnny Depp with a swoonable head of hair, hot crop top, and a smile that was literally to d!e for. Aside from the Oscars being known for showing a lack of respect for the horror genre, the film wasn’t really profound in any way. Wes Craven is a directorial genius, but one doesn’t think of Freddy Krueger and friends when they’re asked to name a film that has changed their life. Depp went on to pair up with Tim Burton and Jerry Bruckheimer for films like Edward Scissorhands, Sweeney Todd, and the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. A few box office successes and three Oscar nominations for “Best Actor” later, Depp has yet to take home Oscar gold. This is likely because he was tied to the same heartthrob narrative that DiCaprio was adhering to in the same decade.Before Depp knew it, teens were kissing their Crybaby poster good night and greeting it in the morning with a girlish smile. Depp romantically paired up with notable stars like Winona Ryder and Kate Moss, and it’s unclear whether the superstar pairings helped or hurt his career. Similarly to Timothée Chalamet, Depp took on the role of Wonka in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and offered a stunning, unrecognizable performance. Depp’s film repertoire/acting arsenal is impressive, having worked with big-name directors—but he’s only received his flowers from fans, critics, and the media. This is just another example of celebrity sensationalization, suggesting that the Academy might not want anything to do with that. DiCaprio realized this after five Oscar losses. Depp definitely knows it after the sensationalized court case between him and his ex-wife, Amber Heard. Now, Timothée might start catching onto the Academy’s game, too. After all, Chalamet dated Depp’s daughter, Lily-Rose.Timotheé’s Online ReceptionTimothée Chalamet is loved by just about everybody online. It’s difficult not to adore the guy when half of the best movies in the last five years have featured the actor, especially when you realize he’s only 29 years old seeking these reputable accolades. He’s even got his own one-woman fan club (if that’s what you can call it), Club Chalamet. Club Chalamet is an internet-famous fan account for Timothée, and the superfan keeps up with all the happenings in the star's life and acts as a Chalamet news outlet for other fans. His existence in the world is not quiet nor insubstantial—it is familiar, yet, at the same time, not at all. DiCaprio and Depp’s rise to stardom occurred in a different era of the film industry and in a time where social media was nearly nonexistent. Will this work in Chalamet’s heartthrob favor, or will it do even more harm than in decades’ past? As a heartthrob, the public's reception of him, though mostly stellar, is also dependent on who he’s seeing. @abefr0man_ on XThe “Kardashian Curse”You can always find the Kardashian/Jenner clan in the limelight at “prestigious” events such as the Met Gala and other high-caliber award shows. There’s talks of a “Kardashian Curse” floating around in the mainstream media. The reality show stars/business women have built an empire larger than life itself, but are not taken seriously due to the low-brow perception of them and of reality television as an artform. It seems since Kylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet paired up, fans’ reception of Chalamet has gotten a bit more lukewarm. Kylie Jenner has not been so lucky on his arm at these awards shows. Golden Globes drama ensued when Demi Moore allegedly ignored Kylie Jenner as she said hello to everyone seated at their table except her. Though the rumor mill runs rampant during awards season, it isn’t unbelievable that Kylie wouldn’t receive the warmest welcome by fans who adore Chalamet and celebrities who might not respect her work and rise to the top. Though the opinion that Kardashian/Jenners are classless is tired and catty, the Academy still seems to take it seriously and exhausts them. As we’re only nine years into what is hopefully a life-long career for Timothée Chalamet, folks are already wondering if he is the next DiCaprio. Unfortunately, my bet is on “yes,” but we’ll just have to wait and see what comes for Chalamet in the years ahead.",
