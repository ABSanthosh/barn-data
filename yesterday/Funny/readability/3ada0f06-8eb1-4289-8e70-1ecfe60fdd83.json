  "description": "There's a certain value in knowledge and experience and novelty that's why things like patents and copyright and NDAs and noncompete agreements exist. Companies use these types of things all the time to protect their \"knowledge\" and \"retain\" it. I even know a barista who was asked to sign an NDA by a boutique cafe over their process for preparing (barista-ing?) coffees… even though they prepared coffee exactly the same as any other cafe in existence. Don't get me wrong, it's really easy to make a bad cup of joe but and NDA… really?This incessant drive to retain the knowledge and uniqueness of a company is why it's all the more confusing that this same effort and vigor isn't put into staff retention, you know, to keep the people around whose brains and muscle memory hold the keys to that same company's success and processes—whose ideas developed that same success and process.In fact, they'll go as far as to have mass layoffs of the most experienced staff to keep the cost of labor at a minimum… even though the company is still profitable? Wait… What?",
