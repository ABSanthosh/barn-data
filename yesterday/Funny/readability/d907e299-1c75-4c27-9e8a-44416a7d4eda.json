  "description": "This, feline fam, is a purrfect example of why we prefer cats over hoomans. We love our feline family more than life itself. Our hooman one… meh. We love them, but that doesn't mean we have to like them. But, to be fair, we never have to lend our cats money - we just have to pay for them for their entire lives. We knew that going into it. The sister in this post probably didn't know that she was going to have to lend her older, selfish sister over $2k when she was going through a tough time, only to be ghosted without a cent in return.The worst part is? The money isn't even for her - it's for their childhood cat. She needs an emergency surgery, and while the cat mom struggles to collect all the cash, her sister is partying on TikTok and actively ignoring her.
