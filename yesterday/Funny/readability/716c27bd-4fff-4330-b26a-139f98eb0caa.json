  "description": "Let's face it: paying rent stinks. It's like setting a pile of money on fire every week just for the privilege of surviving and oddly reminiscent of paying mob dues. You have virtually no rights to the home, along with virtually no guarantees, and in a lot of places, you can basically be asked to leave or pay more arbitrarily at virtually any point. Still, if you're fortunate enough to have a place of your own, you'll come to find that you're basically still just renting from the bank anyway, paying more in interest at the start of your mortgage than you have ever paid in rent, but at least you're not going to be asked to move without defaulting on your payments.Anyways, while paying your landlord's mortgage hurts, and as bad of a rap as landlords might have, it would be insane to just suddenly go around acting like you own the place and attempt to wrench control of the property from them. The reality is that whatever side of privilege they're on and from whatever walk of life, entitled people will be entitled and try to take advantage of any situation presented to them.",

  "text": "Squatter's rights and the legality surrounding them can get pretty strange in a lot of situations, and there are stories every now and then about someone getting access or rights to a property through legalities surrounding their continued residence on the property. This tenant had probably heard some of those stories when she decided that she was indeed entitled to the property she was renting, owing to her long-standing residence there. But, of course, you're not a squatter if you're paying rent, which is where the whole argument sort of falls apart.This original post was shared five years ago with this online community; the original poster returned this week to share an update on what had happened since with their family's Karen tenant. It sounds like everything ended surprisingly amiably, given the situation and how these stories normally go. And the poster's parents, the owners of the property, now have their property back after a minor amount of drama surrounding moving dates.See the original post from five years ago immediately below, followed by the update shared this week starting from item #22. 1 Image does not depict the actual subjects of the story.
