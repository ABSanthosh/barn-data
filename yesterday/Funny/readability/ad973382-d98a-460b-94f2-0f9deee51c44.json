  "description": "One of the things that we love most about cats, feline fam, is that they can really bring people together. We all live so much in our own worlds nowadays that it can be difficult to connect with others. However, cats are the great barrier-breakers - and this video proves it. One unsuspecting guest at a hotel was shocked to find an unaccompanied cat carrier just sitting in their hotel lobby. No pawrents around or anyone to claim the poor cat, so they started asking around. Unfortunately, they didn't have much luck and found out that the cat was abandoned there.Other guests helped them in their search, and one even offered to let it stay with them for the night while its future was being decided. Long story short, the kitty is now off to its furrever home, thanks to these wholesome hotel guests who rallied together to save this poor, scared cat.
