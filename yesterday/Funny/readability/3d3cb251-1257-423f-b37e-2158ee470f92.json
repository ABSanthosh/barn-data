  "description": "Some people fail to understand that just because you love your job, it doesn't mean you would do it for free. You could feel extremely fulfilled, living your dream life, working your dream job, yet you would never agree to do the same thing without getting paid. As much as we sometimes hate to admit it, money matters, and without being fairly compensated for your work, you can't really call it a 'dream job', can you?I like to think that I love what I do for work. I enjoy writing, I love reading stories and scrolling through hilarious memes, and I can genuinely say I like the office and the people I work with. But if at any point a coworker would approach me and ask me to use my day off to come in and write even more, I would laugh in their face. It doesn't matter if I like it or how good I am at it, there is simply no chance I would do it for free.",
