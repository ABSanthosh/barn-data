  "description": "It's never fun when you have a guest who acts like she's the host. It takes a particular kind of human being to have that mentality during a family gathering, but if there's any event that attracts this type of personality, it's most certainly Thanksgiving.Here, we have an entitled sister-in-law who insisted on making a number of Thanksgiving dishes despite the fact that the Redditor expressed a desire to take the lead, as she was the host after all. On top of this tension going into the day, the sister-in-law was difficult once she arrived as well.
