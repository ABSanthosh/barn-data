  "text": "America’s Finest News Source WASHINGTON—Promising a glorious future marked by limitless prosperity for the East Asian nation, President Donald Trump outlined a bold vision Tuesday night for a golden age of China. “Under my leadership, a prosperous new era of Chinese dominance will begin, the likes of which have never been seen before,” Trump said in an address to a joint session of Congress, insisting that China, finally unbridled from the foreign policy of former President Joe Biden, would reach its full potential and claim its rightful place as an unmatched global powerhouse. “Mark my words, the People’s Republic will be the envy of the world. That I can assure you. As long as I’m in charge, nothing will stand in China’s way. My newly implemented tariffs will spur China to be more self-sufficient, stable, and affluent going forward. Believe me when I say we’re going to make China a lot of money.” Trump went on to state that people he had talked to were already calling it the second Ming dynasty.
