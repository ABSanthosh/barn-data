  "description": "Being a social media manager might seem like a lofty, pie-in-the-sky kind of job, but it's a lot harder than people give it credit for. It seems cutesy, right? You picture a young person sitting around on their phone, smiling as they post a photo. That's part of the job, sure, but there's like 90% more to it than that! You've got to plan out the timing of the post, what it will say, who you'll tag, what hashtags you'll use, what other social media sites you'll post it on… the list goes on and on. Then, you do that a dozen more times throughout the day. And for one person, working with a client on a social media campaign just made the whole thing way harder. This dude just would not listen to the social media worker: instead, he kept insisting that they were wrong. He swiftly regretted that, as you can check out in the full story below, as well as in the comments, where the social media manager revealed more information about the story. Up next, have a slice of these bad days in the bakery, like one person who revealed \"the cake that got my coworker fired.\"",
