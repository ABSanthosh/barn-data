The Roman Empire Got It Right by Steven Marr is your passport to the past that built the future—from engineering marvels like aqueducts, concrete, and sewer systems to groundbreaking advances in health care, law, language, and even your favorite guilty pleasures (street food and wine bars may be its highest achievements). Discover with The History Reader 10 genius ideas from the Roman Empire that still matter today. Innocent until proven guilty. One of Rome’s lasting contributions to justice is the idea of “innocent until proven guilty.” While we sometimes take this for granted in courtrooms today, the concept was revolutionary in the ancient world. In Roman courts, the burden of proof was placed on the accuser, meaning it was up to the prosecution to prove someone’s guilt, not up to the accused to prove their innocence. Baby’s first paper trail When Augustus took charge of the Roman Empire, he had a bit of a people problem—specifically, about 45 million of them scattered across the Mediterranean. To bring some order to the chaos (which the Romans loved doing), Augustus introduced a system that would be familiar to anyone today: birth certificates. These official documents recorded the name and birthdate of Roman citizens and were critical for proving one’s right to citizenship and all the perks that came with it.Every Man a Soldier In Rome’s early days, wars were fought by citizen militias, with regular Romans suiting up to defend the republic. It wasn’t just about patriotism; it was expected. This tradition of a citizen army influenced thinkers centuries later. Thomas Jefferson, for instance, admired Rome’s model, suggesting that in a “free state,” every citizen should be a soldier. But, much like Rome, America drifted away from this idea. While early Rome leaned on citizens in times of war, the Roman Empire, like the United States today, eventually maintained a professional army for handling conflicts. Jefferson’s vision of a militia of citizens was great in theory, but when you’re running an empire (or a superpower), sometimes you need the pros.Archimedes before his death with the Roman soldier. Believed to be 18th century copy. Public domain courtesy of Wikimedia. Thank you for your service Rome knew how to keep its military ranks full—by offering perks. Soldiers got regular pay and food, which wasn’t something to scoff at in the ancient world. But the real draw? The retirement package. After twenty-five years of service, assuming a legionnaire survived brutal battles and harsh climates, he could retire with a pension.Meet the medics Believe it or not, before the Romans, soldiers were pretty much left to handle their own medical needs. Got an arrow in your leg? Well, you were on your own—or, if you were lucky, a kind civilian might patch you up. Needless to say, this wasn’t exactly a recipe for long life or high morale on the battlefield. Recognizing the chaos this caused, Emperor Augustus introduced what may have been the world’s first organized military medical system. Each unit of the Roman army was assigned field medics who treated injuries right there on the battlefield. To make things even more efficient, they established a triage system, prioritizing the most serious cases to help first. Augustus didn’t just change the game—he invented the modern playbook for military medical care.Caesar’s secret weapon Julius Caesar wasn’t just a brilliant military strategist—he was also a bit of a tech geek by ancient standards. While conquering Gaul, he grew concerned that his private letters to Rome might be intercepted and read by enemies. His solution: a cipher. Caesar developed what’s now known as the “Caesar cipher,” a simple substitution code in which he shifted letters by three places in the alphabet. So if he wanted to write “A,” he would write “D” instead. By today’s standards, it’s not exactly NSA-level encryption, but for someone without the key, it was frustratingly difficult to decode. Caesar’s innovation shows that even in ancient times, leaders were trying to stay one step ahead of snooping eyes.Goddess Maia. Detail of the side B of an Attic red-figure belly-amphora, ca. 500 BC. Public Domain. Courtesy of Wikimedia. Thanks for the months Ever wonder why January is named as it is? It’s all thanks to the two-faced god Janus, the deity of doors and transitions. February comes from Februa, a purification festival, while March is named after Mars, the god of war (no surprise the Romans kicked off spring with a little war energy!). April derives from aperire, meaning “to open,” a nod to flowers blooming. May is for Maia, a nurturing goddess, and June for Juno, protector of marriage. Then it gets a bit more personal, with July for Julius Caesar and August for Augustus. As for September through December? The Romans must have run out of ideas, because they’re simply named after the numbers seven through ten— despite being the modern months nine through twelve.Charity begins with a public hospital While Roman soldiers had access to military hospitals, civilians weren’t so lucky. Apart from some healers, who operated out of temples (as in Greece), there were no dedicated public health facilities. That changed in 394 CE when Fabiola, a Roman noblewoman and Christian convert, decided to revolutionize healthcare. She established in Rome the first public hospital in western Europe, where anyone, regardless of wealth, could receive medical care. But Fabiola didn’t stop there—she also set up a hospice for travelers and personally walked the streets of Rome looking for sick people to bring back to her hospital. Her compassion and innovation paved the way for future public healthcare systems.Eye-opening surgery Today, cataract surgery involves high-tech gadgets and precise lasers, but back in Roman times, the process was much more hands-on. Roman surgeons used a method that involved inserting a sharp needle directly into the eye to break up the cloudiness in the lens. They would then heat the blunter end of the needle and use it to cauterize the wound. Infection was a serious risk, so antiseptics, such as vinegar lotions, may have been used to prevent complications like conjunctivitis. While it sounds terrifying by today’s standards, this procedure was remarkably effective for the time. It’s a reminder that ancient medical practices, though rough around the edges (and eyes), were still impressive feats of ingenuity and skill.Ancient fat-fighting Weight loss has been a challenge throughout history, and it turns out that the Romans may have pioneered their own version of liposuction. Pliny the Elder tells the story of the son of one of Emperor Caligula’s consuls who had such a severe weight problem that he could barely move. According to Pliny, Roman doctors performed an early fat-removal procedure: “fat was withdrawn . . . and his body was relieved of the weight that made it impossible for him to move.” While Pliny doesn’t provide many details, it seems like the treatment was successful— though we can only imagine what ancient liposuction might have involved. Still, for a culture that valued fitness in its soldiers and citizens, it’s no surprise the Romans were trying innovative methods to fight fat.",
