    "description": "On March 25, 2021, the Modern Greek State celebrated the 200th anniversary of the War of Independence, which ultimately led to its establishment. It is thus an excellent opportunity to reconsider some of the main events of Greek history over these 200 years and how they shaped the character of modern Greece.This series of articles on the history of modern Greece started when the country was celebrating the 200th anniversary of the War of Independence. This article starts by looking at what happened after the end of dictatorship, and takes us through the changing 1980s and 1990s. Thomas P. Papageorgiou explains.You can read part 1 on ‘a bad start’ 1827-1862 here, part 2 on ‘bankruptcy and defeat’ 1863-1897 here, part 3 on ‘glory days’ 1898-1913 here, part 4 on ‘Greeks divided’ 1914-22 here, part 5 on the issues of clientelism here, part 6 on World War2 and a new divide here, and part 7 on the road to dictatorship and retreat here. Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou with United States President Bill Clinton in April 1994. The fall of the dictatorship in Greece in 1974 (Papageorgiou, 2024) coincided with the restoration of democracy in the whole of the European south. Salazar’s dictatorship in Portugal, established in 1932-1933, and Franko’s dictatorship in Spain, established in 1939, came to an end with a counter coup in 1974 that led to free elections in 1976, in the first case, and Franco’s death in 1975 in the second. In all three countries the armed forces would now submit to the political establishment, ending a long tradition of involvement in politics. The Church would also lose much of its prestige because of its identification with the military regimes. Their people were influenced from the success of the European west and north that combined financial prosperity with parliamentarism, which was also consolidated in Greece, Portugal and Spain with their entry in the European Economic Community in the 1980s. (Close, 2006, pp. 219-221)     I Part of the European Economic CommunityThe first free elections after the coup d’etat of 1967 took place in November 1974. Konstantinos Karamanlis, leader of the national unity government formed after the fall of the junta a few months earlier, had meanwhile transformed the former National Radical Union into a new party under the name New Democracy (ND) (Close, 2006, p. 236) representing the biggest part of the conservatives to this day. He won the elections and a few days later he called for a referendum on whether the junta’s decision to abolish constitutional monarchy would be retained or the king would be allowed to return to Greece. 69.2% of the voters decided for a Presidential Republic that also remains to this day. (Wikipedia, 2023)Apart from parting with the king, Karamanlis found himself in a rather peculiar position also in the economy. The private interests establishment that for many years benefited from state subsidies and protectionism proved inadequate to cope with the consequences of the oils crises of 1973 and 1978. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 29) Thus, in spite of its conservative nature, Karamanlis’ government had to step in and started nationalizing private companies. It also had to renegotiate or even cancel deals signed by junta officials with terms highly unfavourable for the state. (Eleftheratos, 2015, pp. 313-314) (Rizas, 2008, pp. 493-494) (Close, 2006, pp. 248-249) In fact, the demand for more freedom and representation, after the fall of the junta, indicated that renegotiation and, where needed, cancelation of established norms in the public life was also needed at that time, much to the dislike of a conservative government. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 30)A possible way out of all these seemed to be the assumption of full membership in the European Economic Community (EEC). Karamanlis was pursuing it already from the 1960s (Papageorgiou, 2024) and in 1979 he made it happen. Thus, soon after the fall of the junta, of the four power pillars that defined the post-civil war period, (Papageorgiou, 2024) the army and the palace were completely removed from the political scenery of the country, the role of the Americans had to be redefined after accession to the EEC and only that of parliamentarism remained untouched and in fact reinforced. (Close, 2006, p. 226)In the following, we will see how the political parties managed the sweeping demand for change from the beginning of 1980s. At that time, Karamanlis assumed the rather ceremonial role of the President of the Republic, (Close, 2006, p. 225) but real power was now in the hands of Andreas Papandreou. His Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PAnelinio SOsialistiko Kinima – PASOK) won the national elections in autumn 1981.   II ChangeThe beginningSo, the political change came. And it brought with it an increase of 35% to salaries, that were further to be automatically adjusted according to the price index. Pension increases and tax exemptions were also established. Karamanlis had already made the Communist Party legal again, (Close, 2006, p. 223) but in the PASOK era political refugees were allowed to return and pensions were handed out to members of the (also Left) resistance during WWII. (Close, 2006, p. 224) A national healthcare system was set up. (Close, 2006, pp. 250, 251-252) Nationalization of private companies continued and more than a 100 once dominant enterprises active, among others, in mining metallurgy, shipbuilding and petrochemicals came under the Business Restructuring Organization. These and the public sector were utilized so that thousands of people could find a job. Indeed, large sections of the population literally switched their status in those early years of PASOK, rapidly climbing the ladder of social stratification and gaining income, power, and authority. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 32 - 35)Too much, too quickly and with no real plan. The spirit of clientelism, ever present in the political and social life of modern Greece, made sure that hiring was based on personal or political relations without evaluation. (Close, 2006, p. 242) This immobilized the Administration, destroyed any concept of hierarchy, eroded values such as those of duty and productivity, made the state apparatus synonymous to that of the political party and  favoured to the maximum degree tendencies of graft and corruption. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 35) (Close, 2006, p. 250)Furthermore, all the above policies were based on borrowed money and EEC resources. (Close, 2006, pp. 260, 269)They contributed to the deindustrialization of the country (Close, 2006, pp. 264, 265, 273-275) and as the agricultural subsidies also, instead of being used for the modernization of agriculture, were turned into apartments in the urban centres and luxury vehicles, (Close, 2006, p. 266) Brussels had already started to feel uncomfortable and characterize Greece as a bad example of a new member state. The Americans were also prejudiced against Papandreou because of his opening to the Arab world, his participation in the Non-Aligned Movement and his anti-American rhetoric with references to the removal of the American bases from Greece, which he never implemented, but with which he constantly exercised pressure to the superpower. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 44)For the Americans another issue was terrorism. During the early years after the fall of the junta, the discussions of armed struggle were revived mainly among members of left-wing organizations and groups. The infamous terrorist organization ‘17th of November’ (17N) was formed during this time and intensified its activity in the mid-1980s hitting American and western targets, businessmen, right-wing politicians, judges, policemen and publishers of traditional conservative newspapers that were now intensifying the criticism against PASOK. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 44) (Close, 2006, pp. 234-235)The Security Services and the Americans were thus prone to investigate conspiracy theories that linked terrorism with PASOK as well as the official and extra-parliamentary Left. For those who spent time at the University those years, however, there was the certainty that the faces of terrorism, those who carried out the bloody acts, could only have come out of the student movement. There was the certainty that these were common, ordinary people. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 24) This partly explains also the longevity of groups like 17N. Another reason was that after the fall of the junta governments relied less to the police and the security forces and more to material benefits for their longevity. (Close, 2006, p. 229) The Greek police after 1974 were paralyzed by a lack of resources, an absence of professionalism and a low level of competence. In the prevailing anti-authoritarian atmosphere, it did not even have the public support that it needed. (Close, 2006, p. 235)The turn  For the common people though, what mattered most were the benefits they enjoyed under Papandreou’s government. Thus, the latter won triumphally the elections of June 1985. Nevertheless, during that summer the country’s foreign exchange reserves had already fallen unbelievably low, deficits and public debt had ballooned, inflation was high and persistent, the loss of competitiveness great and the inadequacy of productive investments evident. EEC officials were also expressing their displeasure for the course of the Greek economy.  The time for major revisions had come. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 52-53)The turn was to be carried out by Costas Simitis (Wikipedia, 2024), who assumed the position of Minister of National Economy. Along with a group of technocratic advisors, Simitis presented a three-year stabilization program, which included a devaluation of the drachma, a wage freeze in the public and private sectors, hiring, borrowing, spending and price controls, restructuring of public enterprises, and, most importantly, initiatives and measures to free the economy and markets from government intervention, combined with the liberalization of the financial sector and the capital market. The implementation of the program was bound by a European emergency loan, which designated the European Commission as an auditor of the Greek economic course. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 55-57) (Close, 2006, p. 244)The program shocked PASOK supporters and brought great turmoil within it, as it meant a complete revision of the until then physiognomy of the populist movement. (Close, 2006, p. 245) It run with difficulties for a couple of years starting the opening to the market economy, (Karakousis, 2006, p. 63) laying the foundations for the rebirth of the stock market and promoting plans to restructure the whole public sector (Karakousis, 2006, p. 65), but Andreas Papandreou eventually denounced it from the parliament floor on 25 November 1987. Simitis resigned the next day. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 74)   Lifestyle, shadow economy and scandalsIndeed, the formerly unprivileged who in the early years of PASOK gained space and incomes were not willing to return to their previous situation. They were getting used to a new way of life, influenced also by lifestyle magazines, (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 59-60)    based on a pattern, which required owning a house, a country house, cars, travel, vacations and a lot of expenses for the children. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 104) As money in the public sector, where as described above the clientelist state accommodated many of its supporters, were not enough, they turned to multiple employment to support it. The bank clerk and the tax official were employed in the afternoon as accountants in the private sector, the schoolteacher gave private lessons and so on. This did not only have implications on the integrity of the public servants regarding the balance of interests between their dual occupations. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 106) The extra salaries were not declared anywhere.   Thus, the new way of life was not supported by borrowed state money only. The private sector followed suit and calculations during the implementation of the Value Added Tax (VAT) in 1987 recorded that the shadow (black) economy amounted to 40% of GDP. A rate extremely large and able to distort any economic policy effort, as a large part of economic activities remained out of control, operated by their own rules and formed their own levels of profitability and incomes, which, to a certain extent, explain the inexhaustible endurance of the citizens of the country, despite the continuous pressure with economic measures and regulations to this day. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 70) (Close, 2006, p. 259)PASOK also sought to continue the tradition of intertwining business interests with state power. (Papageorgiou, 2024)Micro-entrepreneurs, like the Kouris brothers, offered services and support already from the early years of PASOK in power through publications such as the populist newspaper Avriani, (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 36-37) but the most famous case was that of George Koskotas. With many university degrees, later proven to be fake, he started his carrier as accountant at the Bank of Crete. He will progress, become a chief accountant, and one morning he will appear to the owner of the bank with a takeover proposal. The trick was that he used the bank’s own money for the takeover, without anyone noticing. Koskotas moved energetically after that and wanted to play the role of PASOK’s banker. As phenomena of arrogance and corruption had already made their appearance from the first years of the government (see above), Koskotas found fertile ground for his activities. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 60-61)  Nevertheless, Koskotas’ aggressive policies, including attempts to expand in the banking and media sectors as well as in football, where he bought the country’s probably most popular team, Olympiakos Piraeus, (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 79-80)eventually attracted the attention of The Bank of Greece’s legal counsel regarding the origin of the money and the overall management of the Bank of Crete. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 83) It was finally revealed in February 1989 that the government’s vice president Menios Koutsogiorgas attempted to hinder the investigation by law, after a bribe of 2 million dollars. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 100) (Close, 2006, p. 245)       The situation for PASOK continued to worsen as during this period the press published evidence for additional scandals in the procurement of military equipment as well as for the surveillance of the telephones of Leftist officials as well as that of Konstantinos Karamanlis, (Karakousis, 2006, p. 81) (Close, 2006, pp. 245-246) who in the meantime Papandreou had ensured that he was replaced in the Presidency of the Republic by judge Christos Sargetakis. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 52)The newspaper reports caused the intervention of the judiciary while the opposition also hardened its stance. Significant strongholds of the opposition action at that time were the three largest municipalities of the country, Athens, Piraeus, and Thessaloniki, that New Democracy had won in the municipal elections of October 1986. A basic instrument was the free radio that the three conservative mayors, M. Evert, A. Andrianopoulos and S.Kouvelas launched in May 1987 against the state monopoly until then. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 71-72)The fallPapandreou was at a very tough spot. Physically, he was ill and was rushed to London in August 1988 where he remained for almost two months and underwent heart surgery. Personally, he found himself in a turmoil as his affair with a former stewardess of Olympic Airways, Dimitra Liani, became publicly known. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 84) Politically, the scandals led many PASOK officials to resign or distance themselves from the party and triggered scenarios of succession in its leadership. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 92-96) (Close, 2006, p. 246) Furthermore, during the judicial investigations into the scandals, 17N escalated its action against judges, which rekindled the rumours about PASOK’s ties to terrorism. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 98-99)Despite all this, Papandreou fought hard to turn the tide against him. Before the elections of June 1989 he used the standard trick, we have often seen in this series, of changing the electoral law to make it difficult for the Right to come to power. Moreover, in an outburst of populism during a pre-election rally in Athens, he will openly urge Finance Minister D. Tsovolas to ‘give everything’, meaning benefits to the electorate to vote for PASOK. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 107) (Close, 2006, p. 246) And he succeeded. New Democracy won, but its 44,25% of the votes was not enough to give its leader Konstantinos Mitsotakis the absolute majority in the parliament, but only 145 of the 300 seats. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 113) III Co-government of Right and LeftIt was obvious that Mitsotakis had to deal harder blows against PASOK to seize power. At the same time the leadership of the Left saw in PASOK’s destruction the opportunity to expand its electorate audience. Thus, the memories of the civil war and the junta were put aside and the unthinkable happened: a co-government supported by the Right and the Left. (Close, 2006, p. 247) Mitsotakis’ son-in-law, Pavlos Bakoyiannis, played a catalytic role as mediator, using the connections he developed with many Leftist officials during the junta years in Germany, where all had taken refuge. At the head of the government, formed in July 1989, was Tzanis Tzanetakis, o former officer of the Navy, and its goal was ‘Katharsis’. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 115-116)Indeed, by September, Andreas Papandreou and other PASOK officials, including the former ministers Koutsogiorgas and Tsovolas, were refereed by the Parliament to the Special Court for the Koskotas scandal and the wiretapping (see above). Another former minister, Nikos Athanasopoulos, was send to court for the ‘Corn Scandal’, accused of misleading EEC officials by presenting Yugoslavian corn as Greek to collect higher subsidies. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 120-121, 130)(Close, 2006, p. 246)Nevertheless, the ordinary voters of the Left were once again not reconciled to the games of their leadership (Karakousis, 2006, p. 116) In fact, the youth of the Communist Party openly expressed its disagreement with the Tzanetakis’ government. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 128) To make things worse, Papandreou’s new admission to the hospital with respiratory problems at the beginning of the summer had created a wave of sympathy that reinforced the dilemmas of the Left. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 114) Thus, New Democracy’s proposal for yet another commission of inquiry to look into possible scandals in the procurement of weapons systems was not accepted by the coalition of Left parties. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 131) At the same time though, 17N reappeared and murdered Pavlos Bakoyiannis on the way to his office the day before the Parliament decided to send Papandreou to the Special Court for the Koskotas scandal. This reignited the conspiracy theories regarding PASOK’s connection to terrorism. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 128, 130)Coexistence of Right and Left in the Tzanetakis’ government was thus becoming uncomfortable. Nevertheless, the latter seemed to have achieved its main political objective, ‘Katharsis’, by sending PASOK officials to court. It did not do much else, except for allowing the establishment of private television stations breaking another state monopoly, after that of radio broadcast (see above). The new development brought with it kitsch, subculture, the keyhole screen, a spectacle of second-rate, intellectual poverty and degradation of everything. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 122-127) Furthermore, the different perspectives of Right and Left combined with benefits generously handed out by the Finance Minister Antonis Samaras (Right) and the Minister of the Interior Nikos Konstantopoulos (Left), to the delight of the electorate, worsened public finances and brought the country to the brink of yet another fiscal crisis. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 118-119) It was time for another round of elections. IV The Right Comes to PowerThe elections took place on the 5th of November 1989 and New Democracy increased its percentage of the votes to 46.2%. Nevertheless, this was again not enough to bring Mitsotakis to power. New Democracy elected only 148 out of 300 parliament members. PASOK was once again proved very resilient increasing its power to 40,7% of the votes, while the Left coalition lost 2% receiving 11% of the votes. Obviously, its plan to substitute PASOK through the participation to Tzanetakis’ government did not work well. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 136) (Close, 2006, pp. 247-248)In view of the critical condition of the economy the solution of an ecumenical government finally prevailed under the leadership of the then 90 years old former Governor of the Bank of Greece Xenophon Zolotas. The period of indifference was over, and the political establishment, at that juncture, understood that it could not play with the economy. It was convinced that the crisis conditions had to be controlled at any cost. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 140) It was also centrally agreed that the only way forward for Greece was Europe: Greece should claim its inclusion in the new system of the single currency, which was then being planned, but it was clear that it would be the European answer to the new form that the world would take after the collapse of the Soviet Union. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 144) (Close, 2006, pp. 287-288)Nevertheless, Mitsotakis was becoming impatient. After all, his party found itself in an ecumenical government together with PASOK, whose leaders were prosecuted from Right and Left just a few days before. Indeed, Papandreou was recovering quickly politically, also with interventions like that of France’s president François Mitterrand, who invited him to Paris already before the November elections and thus took him out of the Greek isolation showing that he maintained an international base and was not finished as many would like him to be. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 133) As Zolotas’ freedom for action was limited by the need to reconcile the Right, Center and Left elements of the ecumenical government and he had to resort to desperate measures, like borrowing with an interest rate greater than 27%, in order to meet the cash needs of the state, (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 139-140) Mitsotakis stressed the need for absolute majority in the Parliament and a one party government to meet the country’s needs. Another international intervention helped him to this end. It was a letter from the President of the European Commission Jacques Delors that was publicized by Mitsotakis and conveyed to the Greek society the need to obtain a decisive government, capable of handling the economic affairs in a clear manner. Thus, another round of elections was scheduled for the 9th of April 1990. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 157-158)(Close, 2006, p. 361)New Democracy’s 46.88% of the votes gave 150 seats in the parliament, again one less of the minimum needed for it to rule. The missing vote came with the defection to New Democracy of the only representative elected with Democratic Renewal (Dimokratiki Ananeosi – DIANA). The latter was a party founded by Konstantinos Stefanopoulos, a former New Democracy member and then internal party rival of Mitsotakis. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 161)New Democracy’s accent to power at the beginning of the 1990s coincided with the long retreat of the interventionist state from the commanding heights of the economy accelerated in the previous decade with a conservative counterattack spearheaded by Ronald Reagan in the US and Margaret Thatcher in the UK. (Allawi, 2024, p. 131) The collapse of the Soviet Union was considered the most striking verification of this process. Thus, privatizations were at the core of the Right’s liberal agenda. Nevertheless, the clientelist state was ever present (Karakousis, 2006, p. 173) and privatizations were not viewed by the government as a development tool for the economy, but as a mechanism of wealth and state assets distribution to friends and acquaintances. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 182-183)Furthermore, privatizations were faced with strong opposition from the employees of the enterprises involved. The same was true for the pension, (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 167-168) tax (Karakousis, 2006, p. 166) and education reforms (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 175-177) that the government tried to introduce. By 1992 the treaty of Maastricht with the Euro convergence criteria (Wikipedia, 2024), following Greece’s decision to be part of the European Union and the common currency zone (see above), hardened the position of the government (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 212-215). This brought it into conflict with the society (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 219-221) that was not going to easily give up the privileges obtained during the PASOK years described previously. In fact, the overall climate was very tense and involved extreme incidents like the murder of the high school teacher Nikos Temponeras during clashes at a school in Patras (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 176-177) and the death of former minister Koutsogiorgas that suffered a stroke during the trial for the Koskotas scandal. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 185-187) 17N also reappeared attempting unsuccessfully to kill the businessman Vardis Vardinogiannis (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 177-178) and the finance minister Giannis Palaiokrassas. In the second case though, a civilian, the young Thanos Axarlian, who happened to be passing by the area of the attack was killed. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 221-222) (Close, 2006, pp. 362-363)As if these were not enough, ‘Katharsis’ was also turning into a fiasco for Mitsotakis. Although some former PASOK ministers, like the above-mentioned Athanasopoulos, served prison sentences, (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 183-185) its leader Andreas Papandreou was declared not guilty (with 6 votes against 5). (Karakousis, 2006, p. 197) The old Konstantinos Karamanlis, who was again elected President of the Republic, after Mitsotakis’ ascend to power, (Karakousis, 2006, p. 163) had warned that one ‘does not send a prime minister to court, but simply home’. Mitsotakis ignored him and the court verdict came to reinforce Papandreou’s (and PASOK’s) feeling that he could dominate again. (Close, 2006, p. 350)New Democracy’s fall came from the field of foreign affairs though. Although, after the fall of the Soviet Union the major international incident of the time was the first Iraq war – in the coverage of which the dominance of television over all other media became obvious for the first time- (Karakousis, 2006, p. 172) Germany’s recognition of the independence of  Croatia and Slovenia in late 1991 triggered the process of Yugoslavia’s disintegration. One of the emerging states in former Yugoslavia’s south, bordering to Greece, then claimed for itself the name ‘Macedonia’ touching upon the national feelings of the Greek people, who were not willing to give up the heritage of Alexander the Great, ruler of ancient Macedonia, to the Slavs without a fight. Mitsotakis’ government was literally caught sleeping. It had made no preparation to deal with the possibility of recognition of a Macedonian state on Greece’s northern borders and the disturbance that such a thing would cause inside the country. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 190 - 191) (Close, 2006, pp. 405-406)     Indeed, demonstrations, mostly in Thessaloniki with more than one million participants, hampered efforts to find a compromise solution by using a composite name prepared by the European Union (Karakousis, 2006, p. 196) (Close, 2006, p. 406) while there were internal party reactions as well that led to the dismissal of the at that time Minister of Foreign Affairs Antonis Samaras from the government. The reason was his differentiation from the views of Mitsotakis and Karamanlis at a meeting of the political parties’ leaders under the President, in April 1992, to discuss national policy on the name issue. By autumn 1993 Samaras had formed his own party (Political Spring – Politiki Anixi) and several of new Democracy’s members of Parliament followed him bringing down Mitsotakis’ government. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 237) (Close, 2006, p. 408) V Andreas Papandreou Returns to PowerParliamentary elections were held on 10th of October 1993 and PASOK took 46% of the votes corresponding to 170 seats in the parliament. But Papandreou now knew that he could not continue the policy of benefits to the people he exercised in the past. The economy had to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria, if Greece was to remain part of the European Union including the adoption of the common currency (Euro). (Close, 2006, p. 363) This was not easy at all with inflation at 15%, double digit interest rates, public deficits reaching 15% of the GDP, the widespread shadow economy and the corresponding tax evasion. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 263)   Thus, brave policies were necessary and, in view of the intense pressure from the society for financial aid of any type, conflicts with numerous groups of citizens. Nevertheless, the latter were at the same time convinced that PASOK would do the job at the lowest possible cost, without the atrocities of Mitsotakis and the heavy feeling of social analgesia the accompanied him. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 248) (Close, 2006, p. 364) Furthermore, the element of external imposition made things easier politically as it allowed the government officials to invoke Brussels and through this invocation to legitimize measures and policies that were in conflict with society. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 263) (Close, 2006, p. 364) At the same time though, Andreas Papandreou knew that the acceptance of the convergence process with Europe would be accompanied by a significant package of European Union funds. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 247) The idea was simple. The European funds would be directed to large scale public works and through them any development and income deficit caused be the fiscal adjustment would be covered. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 249) (Close, 2006, p. 283)Thus, as prescribed in the treaty of Maastricht, at the beginning of 1994 already, the Greek state had to give up the so called ‘monetary financing’ and come out competitively to the market to raise financial resources. Indeed, before 1994, several mechanisms constituted this so called ‘monetary financing’ that allowed the state to raise funds with small or at least controllable cost. For example, at the beginning of each year, the Bank of Greece provided an advance payment of 10% on the increase of the state budget expenditure with a symbolic interest rate of 1.5%. Furthermore, it obliged banks to place 40% of their deposits on interest-bearing Treasury bills, whereas in times of crisis the central bank bought government securities, often to a large extent. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 254-255)If this was not enough, the government could always turn to the so-called bondholder class offering two to three-year government bonds with high interest rates exceeding 20% per year (see also the previous section). This way, a mood of laziness and idleness was transmitted to society, as an available savings capital was sufficient to offer high profits and large incomes. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 245)   In the three years 1994-96 all this will change. The state will acquire a reliable Treasury service and gradually be freed from its dependence on the bondholder class. Interest rates will fall, and the banking system will find itself with freed up resources and new opportunities to grow and develop new financial tools. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 256)In 1994, a new law also attempted to limit the political parties’ power for appointments in the public sector. It introduced the rule of one recruitment for every five departures and mandated both the establishment of the Supreme Personnel Selection Board as an independent body responsible for recruitment and the establishment of rules and procedures so that these are invariable. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 269)In 1995, a new tax law tried to address the issue of tax evasion. The so called ‘objective criteria’ for the taxation of small and medium enterprises and freelancers were established. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 267) (Close, 2006, p. 354) Parameters like the kind of activity, area of operation, operational costs and others were used to define a minimum level of tax for the legal or physical entity in question. When the entity declared an income corresponding to a tax level lower than this minimum, then either the minimum had to be paid, or the entity would be subject to extensive tax scrutiny. In fact, measures to enhance tax revenues were put in place from the very first days of this new term of PASOK increasing indirect taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, taking measures to crack down on smuggling and putting pressure on traders to return the value added tax, incorporated by PASOK already back in 1987 following directives of the EEC. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 70, 246)Nevertheless, these attempts do not mean that clientelism was suddenly over and that the political parties were over their fear of the political cost. For example, construction and the public works mentioned earlier as expression of hope, as a mechanism of development and progress will become hotbeds of corruption, scandals and money waste, dragging politics with them. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 254)In fact, Papandreou’s government acrobated between the old habits and the need for modernization. Things got worse as the latter’s health deteriorated once more in the summer of 1995 leaving plenty of space for a group of people close to his former mistress and by this time wife and secretary, Dimitra Liani, to run the game. A typical example of this period is the former Olympic Airways stewardess’ resistance to the consolidation of the company, which had accumulated debts of 600 billion drachmas, because of the political cost. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 265) Other of Liani’s doings included the purchase of a villa in Ekali, the most prestigious neighbourhood of Athens, under economically uncertain conditions and an entourage of astrologists and priests, who brought miraculous talismans with them in the hope that the patient Papandreou would regain his health. This was a third world government structure that infuriated PASOK’s executives that were now discussing openly Papandreou’s succession. (Karakousis, 2006, pp. 259, 261)This eventually came in January 1996, when Papandreou resigned from office. The inter party elections named Costas Simitis as the new president of PASOK and prime minister, who will make Modernization his flag. (Karakousis, 2006, p. 277) Papandreou died in June. VI ConclusionsIn this series of articles on the history of modern Greece reference has been made to the work of Acemoglu and Robinson (Acemoglu \u0026 Robinson, 2013) and it has been pointed out that the country is suffering from non-inclusive political and economic institutions. Within this framework, some additional characteristics, obvious in the present part of the series, should not go unnoticed: 1) An over-sized public sector and bureaucracy, as seen in the clientelism approach of serving the political parties’ clients/voters with jobs. 2) Economic statism, as seen in the handling of nationalized/state owned companies and attempts to boost the economy through public works. 3) Corruption, as seen in the political/economic scandals described above. Special reference should also be made to: 4) tax evasion, as seen in the size of the shadow economy, resulting in 5) over taxation, as seen in the establishment of the ‘objective criteria’.  And finally, 6) populism, as seen in Papandreou’s ‘give everything’ cry, before the elections of June 1989.     Dimitrios Lakasas proposes that the Greek economy today in undermined by three elephants (bureaucracy, statism and corruption), five tigers (tax evasion, over taxation, high insurance contributions for employees and businesses, high cost of money and unserviced loans) and a lioness (populism) . (Lakasas, 2021, p. 289) The three elephants, two of the tigers and the lioness are clearly seen already in the period studied in this article.  Did you find that piece interesting?

    "description": "The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World are often cloaked in the haze of legend and antiquity, but a strong argument can be made that these structures were indeed real and not mere myths.Terry Bailey explains. A 16th-century depiction of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. By Dutch artist Maarten van Heemskerck.First, several of the wonders, such as the Great Pyramid of Giza, still exist and can be seen today, offering undeniable, physical proof of their historical reality. The Great Pyramid, constructed around 2560 BCE, is a marvel of engineering that continues to impress modern architects and archaeologists. Its continued existence proves that at least part of the list is firmly grounded in historical fact rather than myth or exaggeration.In addition, ancient historical sources from a variety of cultures describe the other wonders in surprisingly consistent detail. For instance, the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus and the Statue of Zeus at Olympia were both described by ancient writers such as Philo of Byzantium, Strabo, and Pliny the Elder. Their writings, based on first-hand accounts or reports from credible travelers, suggest these were real places seen and admired by ancient audiences. Archaeological evidence supports their accounts: for example, the ruins of the Temple of Artemis were unearthed in the 19th century, revealing the temple's grand scale and artistic richness, aligning with historical descriptions.Furthermore, the construction of such wonders was entirely within the technological capabilities of the civilizations that built them. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon, often the most disputed of the seven, have been the subject of scholarly debate, but even here there is plausible evidence, such as references in cuneiform texts and possible confusion with gardens built in Nineveh by the Assyrian king Sennacherib. Historians suggest that rather than being mythical, the Gardens may have been misattributed in location or form, rather than fabricated altogether.Needless to say, the Seven Wonders were likely real, tangible structures that inspired awe in ancient times. While embellishments and inaccuracies may have crept into their stories over centuries, the core reality of their existence is supported by physical evidence, credible ancient testimony, and the engineering capabilities of the societies that built them. Rather than myths, they should be regarded as historical milestones in humanity's architectural and artistic achievements.  The Great Pyramid of Giza (Egypt)Location: Giza Plateau, near Cairo, Egypt. Constructed: c. 2560 BCE. Builder: Pharaoh Khufu (Cheops). Status: The only surviving wonder.The Great Pyramid of Giza, located on the Giza Plateau near Cairo, Egypt, is the oldest and only surviving intact structure of the original Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom around 2580–2560 BCE, it served as the tomb of Pharaoh Khufu (also known by the Greek name Cheops). Originally rising to a height of approximately 146.6 meters (481 feet), it remained the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years. Today, due to the loss of the outer casing stones and erosion, the pyramid stands at about 138.8 meters (455 feet) tall.The Great Pyramid was constructed using an estimated 2.3 million limestone and granite blocks, some weighing up to 80 tons. Despite extensive studies, the exact techniques used to build the pyramid remain a subject of debate and fascination. Ancient records suggest that tens of thousands of skilled workers, rather than slaves as once believed, toiled for decades to complete the colossal monument. Its alignment with the cardinal points and precise proportions demonstrate a high level of mathematical and architectural sophistication for its time.Inside the pyramid, the most famous internal structures include the King's Chamber, the Queen's Chamber, and the Grand Gallery, all part of a complex network of tunnels and passageways. The pyramid was originally covered in polished white Tura limestone, which would have made it shine brilliantly under the Sun. Although many of these casing stones have since been removed or eroded, the Great Pyramid still evokes awe and wonder. It remains a symbol of ancient Egyptian ingenuity, and religious devotion, and a lasting testament to humanity's ability to achieve monumental feats. Historical referencesHerodotus (5th century BCE) described the pyramid in Histories, attributing a 20-year construction period and noting slave labor, though as indicated modern scholars now believe skilled workers were used.Ancient graffiti found within the pyramid's chambers mentions the \"Friends of Khufu\" work crew, lending credence to organized labor groups. Archaeological evidenceExcavations at Giza have revealed worker villages, bakeries, and tools, confirming a highly organized and well-fed workforce, likely composed of seasonal laborers rather than slaves. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon (Iraq)Location: Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Iraq. Constructed: c. 6th century BCE (disputed)Builder: Traditionally attributed to King Nebuchadnezzar II. Status: Destroyed; location and existence debated. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon, often regarded as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, evoke images of a lush, terraced paradise rising amidst the arid landscape of Mesopotamia. Said to have been located in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah in Iraq, the gardens were described by ancient Greek writers as a marvel of engineering and beauty.Towering terraces were allegedly filled with exotic trees, flowering plants, and cascading waterfalls, creating the illusion of a verdant mountain built in the heart of the desert. The most popular legend attributes the gardens' construction to King Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 605–562 BCE), who supposedly built them to please his Median wife, Amytis, who longed for the green hills of her homeland.Despite the gardens' fame, there is significant debate among historians and archaeologists about whether they existed. There are no definitive Babylonian records describing the gardens, and they are conspicuously absent from the extensive inscriptions left behind by Nebuchadnezzar himself, who otherwise documented many of his building projects in Babylon.The most detailed descriptions of the Hanging Gardens come from later Greek and Roman writers, such as Strabo and Philo of Byzantium, who never saw them firsthand and would have relied on secondhand accounts that may have confused them with other sites. Some scholars have proposed an alternative theory that the gardens may have existed, but not in Babylon. The Assyrian capital of Nineveh, under King Sennacherib (r. 705–681 BCE), is now considered a possible candidate for the true location of the Hanging Gardens. Archaeological excavations in Nineveh have uncovered evidence of elaborate palace gardens and an advanced irrigation system, including aqueducts and a water-raising screw, which could match the technological feats described in ancient texts.Whether myth or reality, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon continue to capture the imagination as a symbol of opulence, innovation, and the timeless human desire to bring nature into the heart of civilization. Historical referencesStrabo and Philo of Byzantium provided detailed descriptions of the gardens.As indicated Babylonian texts, including Nebuchadnezzar's inscriptions, never mention the gardens. Archaeological evidenceExcavations by Robert Koldewey in the early 20th century uncovered a large vaulted structure in Babylon, possibly used for irrigation. However, evidence suggests alternative theories that place the gardens in Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, as described by Sennacherib's inscriptions, which boast of similar engineering marvels which may be more accurate. The Statue of Zeus at Olympia (Greece) Location: Olympia, Greece. Constructed: c. 435 BCE. Builder: Sculptor Phidias. Status: Destroyed (possibly by fire in the 5th century CE).The Statue of Zeus at Olympia, ( (Ζεύς ἐν Ὀλυμπίᾳ), a monumental sculpture that stood as a testament to the grandeur and artistic achievement of ancient Greece. Created around 435 BCE by the renowned sculptor Phidias, the statue was housed in the Temple of Zeus in Olympia, the site of the ancient Olympic Games. This majestic statue depicted Zeus, the king of the Greek gods, seated on a magnificent throne, radiating both authority and benevolence.Made primarily of ivory and gold over a wooden framework (a technique known as chryselephantine), the statue reached an estimated height of 12 meters (approximately 40 feet), making it so large that its head nearly brushed the temple's ceiling. Zeus held a figure of Nike, the goddess of victory, in his right hand and a scepter topped with an eagle in his left. The intricate detailing on his robes, the throne's decorations with mythical creatures, and the overall scale of the piece left ancient visitors in awe, with some ancient writers claiming that it gave the impression Zeus himself had descended from Olympus.The statue stood for over 800 years, but its fate remains somewhat mysterious. It was likely moved to Constantinople in the 4th century CE, where it was eventually destroyed, possibly in a fire. Although the statue no longer survives, descriptions from ancient texts and depictions on coins give us a glimpse of its grandeur. The Statue of Zeus was not only a religious icon but also a symbol of Greek artistic excellence and devotion to their deities. Its legacy continues to capture the imagination of historians, artists, and enthusiasts of classical antiquity. Historical referencesPausanias, the Greek traveler, offers a detailed 2nd-century CE account of the statue's grandeur, in addition to, the description by Philo of Byzantium.Coins and ancient illustrations depict Zeus holding a scepter and a statue of Nike (Victory) in his outstretched hands. Archaeological evidenceExcavations at Olympia have revealed the workshop of Phidias, complete with tools, terracotta molds, and a cup inscribed with \"I belong to Phidias\", confirming the statue's place and construction. The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus (Turkey)Location: Ephesus, near modern Selçuk, Turkey. Constructed: Multiple phases, most notably c. 550 BCE. Builder: Croesus of Lydia (funded the grandest version). Status: Destroyed (arson, plunder, and natural disaster)The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, (Ἀρτεμίσιον ἐν Ἐφέσῳ), located near the modern town of Selçuk in Turkey, stood as a masterpiece of architecture and religious devotion. Dedicated to Artemis, the Greek goddess of the hunt, wilderness, and fertility, the temple was originally constructed around 550 BCE by the Cretan architect Chersiphron and his son Metagenes, under the patronage of the wealthy Lydian king Croesus.Built entirely of marble and adorned with sculptural decorations by some of the most skilled artists of the time, the temple was considered the largest of its kind in the ancient Greek world, far surpassing the size of the Parthenon in Athens. The grandeur of the temple was not merely in its scale but also in its cultural and religious significance. It served as a major center for worship, pilgrimage, and commerce, attracting visitors from across the Mediterranean.Artemis of Ephesus was worshipped in a form distinct from the classical Greek goddess, often depicted with multiple breast-shaped orbs considered symbols of fertility, reflecting a blend of Anatolian and Hellenic traditions.The temple complex also functioned as a bank and refuge during times of conflict, further underscoring its importance in the ancient world. Tragically, the original temple was destroyed by arson in 356 BCE, reportedly by a man named Herostratus who sought fame through infamy. A new temple, even more magnificent, was later rebuilt on the same site, but it too fell into ruin after successive invasions and centuries of neglect.Today, only a few remnants of the great structure remain, including scattered columns and foundations, yet the legacy of the Temple of Artemis endures as a symbol of ancient architectural brilliance and the rich cultural history of Ephesus. Historical referencesPliny the Elder described its dimensions and details in Natural History.Antipater of Sidon called it more marvelous than any other wonder. Archaeological evidenceExcavations by British archaeologist John Turtle Wood in the 1860s uncovered foundations and column fragments. Some sculpted column drums and decorative elements are now housed in the British Museum. The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (Turkey)Location: Bodrum, Turkey (ancient Halicarnassus). Constructed: c. 350 BCE. Builder: Queen Artemisia II of Caria for her husband Mausolus. Status: Destroyed (earthquakes, 12th-15th centuries CE). The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, located in present-day Bodrum, Turkey, was built around 350 BCE as a monumental tomb for Mausolus, a satrap (governor) of the Persian Empire, and his sister-wife Artemisia II. The structure not only served as a tomb but also as a lasting tribute to Mausolus' legacy. So grand and unique was this structure that his name, Mausolus, became the root of the modern word \"mausoleum.\"The Mausoleum stood approximately 45 meters (148 feet) high and was an extraordinary blend of Greek, Egyptian, and Lycian architectural elements. It featured a large rectangular base, a colonnaded midsection with Ionic columns, and a stepped pyramid roof topped by a grand statue of a chariot pulled by four horses. The sculptural decorations, created by some of the most celebrated sculptors of the time, Scopas, Leochares, Bryaxis, and Timotheus, depicted scenes from myth and history, showcasing the artistic richness of the era.Though the Mausoleum survived for many centuries, it was eventually brought down by a series of earthquakes during the medieval period. By the 15th century, the remaining ruins were dismantled by the Knights of St. John, who used the stones to build the nearby Bodrum Castle.Despite its destruction, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus remains a symbol of architectural innovation and cultural fusion. Its artistic and structural legacy continues to influence funerary architecture even today. Historical referencesPliny the Elder and Vitruvius gave accounts of its structure and significance.Antipater of Sidon praised its symmetry and ornamentation. Archaeological evidenceExcavations in the 19th century revealed foundation stones, frieze reliefs, and statues, some of which are displayed at the British Museum, including fragments of the quadriga (four-horse chariot). The Colossus of Rhodes (Greece)Location: Rhodes, Greece. Constructed: c. 292–280 BCE. Builder: Sculptor Chares of Lindos. Status: Destroyed by an earthquake (226 BCE).The Colossus of Rhodes, (Κολοσσὸς Ῥόδου), was a massive bronze statue that once stood proudly at the entrance to the harbor of the island city of Rhodes, Greece. Built around 292–280 BCE, the statue was erected to honor the Sun god Helios, the patron deity of the Rhodians, following their successful defense against a siege by Demetrius I of Macedon. It was intended not just as a symbol of divine protection, but also as a celebration of the city's resilience and unity. The statue stood approximately 33 meters, (108 feet) high, making it one of the tallest statues of the ancient world.Constructed by the sculptor Chares of Lindos, a native of Rhodes and a student of the great sculptor Lysippos, the Colossus was created using bronze plates over an iron framework, a technique similar to that used centuries later for the Statue of Liberty. It is believed that the statue stood on a pedestal near the harbor entrance, although the popular image of it straddling the harbor with ships passing beneath its legs is considered a later myth. The project reportedly took 12 years to complete and was funded by selling the abandoned equipment left behind by the defeated Macedonian army.Tragically, the Colossus stood for only about 54 years before it was toppled by a massive earthquake in 226 BCE. Though it lay in ruins, its remains still inspired awe for centuries. The broken statue lay on the ground for over 800 years before Arab conquerors sold the scrap metal during their invasion of Rhodes in 654 CE.Despite its relatively short existence, the Colossus of Rhodes remains one of the most iconic symbols of ancient Greek engineering and artistic ambition, a testament to the ingenuity and pride of a city that once stood at the crossroads of ancient maritime power. Historical referencesPliny the Elder provides measurements and notes the broken statue's remains were visible for centuries.The Suda, a Byzantine encyclopedia, mentions the statue's grandeur and eventual destruction. Archaeological evidenceNo physical remains have been definitively identified. However, ancient foundations consistent with monumental statuary have been found near the harbor, and Rhodes minted coins featuring Helios with a radiant crown, indicating the cultural significance of the statue. The Pharos (Lighthouse) of Alexandria (Egypt)Location: Pharos Island, Alexandria, Egypt. Constructed: c. 280 BCE. Builder: Commissioned by Ptolemy I, completed under Ptolemy II. Status: Destroyed by earthquakes (between 956–1323 CE).The Pharos of Alexandria, also known as the Lighthouse of Alexandria, stood as a marvel of engineering and architecture for centuries. Built on the small island of Pharos just off the coast of Alexandria, Egypt, it was commissioned by Ptolemy I Soter and completed during the reign of his son, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, around 280 BCE. Designed by the Greek architect Sostratus of Cnidus, the lighthouse was constructed to guide sailors safely into the busy harbor of Alexandria, one of the most important trading centers of the ancient world.Estimates of the lighthouse's height vary, but ancient sources suggest it stood between 100 and 130 meters, (roughly 330 to 430 feet) tall, making it one of the tallest man-made structures of antiquity. Its design was tiered, comprising a square base, a cylindrical middle section, and a smaller circular beacon at the top, possibly topped with a statue, some accounts say of Zeus or Poseidon. During the day, the Sun reflected off polished bronze mirrors that helped guide ships, while at night, a fire was maintained, magnified by reflective surfaces to create a beam visible for miles. The Pharos was both a functional aid to navigation and a symbol of Alexandria's grandeur and Hellenistic sophistication.The lighthouse endured for many centuries, but it was severely damaged by a series of earthquakes between the 10th and 14th centuries CE. Eventually, it collapsed and was no longer functional, though its legacy endured. In the 15th century, the Sultan of Egypt used some of its fallen stones to build the Citadel of Qaitbay on the same site.Today, underwater archaeological explorations have uncovered remnants of the lighthouse in the harbor, providing insight into its structure and significance.Side note:- Pharos (Latin: Pharus) was the name of the island where the lighthouse was built. The Lighthouse of Pharos became so iconic that the name Pharos became synonymous with any lighthouse. The original root of the word is derived from the Greek word for the island: Φάρος (Pháros). Historical referencesStrabo and Pliny the Elder praised its design and function.The Arab traveler Ibn Battuta witnessed its ruined form in the 14th century. Archaeological evidenceIn 1994, underwater archaeologists discovered large stone blocks, statues, and sphinxes submerged near Alexandria's Eastern Harbor, likely remnants of the lighthouse. Some artefacts are now visible in underwater tours and museum exhibits ConclusionIn conclusion, the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World represent far more than a nostalgic list of lost marvels, they are enduring testaments to humanity's early pursuit of architectural mastery, artistic brilliance, and cultural identity. While only the Great Pyramid of Giza still stands today, the other wonders, though destroyed or lost to time, are far from mythical.Through a combination of ancient historical writings, surviving ruins, and archaeological discoveries, a compelling case emerges that these wonders were real, physical structures that once inspired awe in those who beheld them.Each wonder reflects the values and capabilities of the civilization that created it: the Pyramid demonstrates the precision and ambition of ancient Egypt; the Hanging Gardens, whether in Babylon or Nineveh, embody the ingenuity of Mesopotamian irrigation and design; the Statue of Zeus reveals the grandeur of Greek artistry and religious devotion; and the Temple of Artemis shows the cultural richness and architectural sophistication of ancient Anatolia.Together, these wonders speak not only to the glory of the ancient world but also to our enduring desire to commemorate the extraordinary. Rather than being dismissed as legend, the Seven Wonders should be embraced as real expressions of ancient human achievement.Their stories blend fact, tradition, and some inevitable exaggeration, offering a valuable understanding into the civilizations that shaped the foundation of our modern world. They continue to inspire curiosity, scholarship, and admiration, reminding us that even across millennia, humanity's drive to build, create, and remember is a wonder in itself. The site has been offering a wide variety of high-quality, free history content since 2012.

He was born in Byzantium but spent a significant part of his life in Alexandria, one of the great centers of learning in the Hellenistic world. Philo is best known for his contributions to mechanics and engineering, particularly in pneumatics, siegecraft, and automation. His work reflects the blending of practical engineering with theoretical science, a hallmark of Hellenistic intellectual achievement.One of Philo's most notable achievements is his treatise Mechanike Syntaxis (\"Compendium of Mechanics\"), a large work that originally consisted of nine books. Only parts of it survive today, including sections on pneumatics and military engineering. In his Pneumatica, Philo described various devices that operated using air, steam, or water pressure, some of which may be considered early forms of automation. These included water fountains, force pumps, and even a primitive form of the steam engine.Philo is also one of the earliest known writers to mention the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. In a lost work titled Peri tōn hepta theamatōn (Greek: Περὶ τῶν ἑπτὰ θεαμάτων, \"On the Seven Wonders\"), he compiled a list of what were considered the most magnificent man-made structures of his time.Although the original text is lost, later sources preserve parts of it and refer to his descriptions, which helped shape the canonical list known today. Philo's writings emphasized not only the grandeur and aesthetics of the wonders but also their architectural and engineering ingenuity, aligning with his interests in mechanical and structural excellence.Through his surviving works and his lost but influential writings on the wonders of the world, Philo of Byzantium remains a key figure in understanding both ancient engineering and how classical civilizations valued technological and artistic marvels. Linking the goddess Nike to the modern OlympicsThe statue of Zeus at Olympia, (Ζεύς ἐν Ὀλυμπίᾳ), held in his outstretched right hand a smaller figure of the goddess Nike, (Νίκη), the personification of victory. This symbolic gesture captured the heart of the Olympic spirit: the pursuit of excellence, triumph, and divine favor. The ancient Olympic Games were held in Zeus's honor and were as much about pleasing the gods as they were about celebrating human achievement. Nike, literally \"Victory,\" embodied the glory bestowed upon those who emerged triumphant in athletic competition, linking sport with the divine.That association between athletic excellence and military prowess became even more poignant after the Battle of Marathon in 490 BCE. In that iconic clash, the vastly outnumbered Athenians defeated the invading Persian forces, a moment seen not just as a military victory, but as a triumph of democratic courage and physical endurance. According to legend, a runner named Pheidippides, (Φειδιππίδης), ran from the battlefield to Athens, over 26 miles, in armor across rough mountain trails after the battle to announce \"Νενικήκαμεν!\" (Nenikēkamen) — meaning \"We have won!\" or \"We are victorious!\" before collapsing and dying.This legendary feat of endurance is the mythic origin of the modern marathon event. In the aftermath, Nike was more than just the goddess of victory, she became a national symbol of survival, resilience, and the favor of the gods.When the modern Olympic Games were revived in 1896, the legacy of Nike and the ideals represented by the statue of Zeus lived on. The inclusion of the marathon race honored the Athenian spirit at Marathon, tying the Games directly to that moment of historical heroism.Nike remains a potent symbol today: her winged figure graces medals and trophies, embodying the timeless quest for greatness. Through Zeus's hand and the battlefield of Marathon, the thread of victory stretches across millennia, binding the ancient and modern Olympics in a celebration of strength, perseverance, and the enduring power of human ambition. The Breasts of ArtemisArtemis, the ancient Greek goddess of the hunt, wild animals, wilderness, childbirth, and the Moon, was one of the most widely venerated deities in the Greek world. As a virgin goddess and the twin sister of Apollo, Artemis represents an archetype of fierce independence, often depicted with a bow and accompanied by a deer or hunting dogs. While many temples were dedicated to her across the Greek world, the most iconic and enigmatic representation of Artemis comes from the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, (Main text), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.The Ephesian Artemis, however, departs dramatically from the typical youthful huntress image. Her statues display a rigid, frontal pose and an unusual adornment on her chest that has sparked scholarly debate for centuries: the presence of multiple rounded protuberances, often interpreted as multiple breasts.The traditional interpretation of these rounded shapes suggests that they represent multiple breasts, symbolizing Artemis as a universal mother and fertility goddess. This view aligns more closely with Anatolian mother goddess figures like Cybele and reflects the syncretism between Greek and earlier local deities in Asia Minor.The Ephesian Artemis may therefore represent a convergence of identities, combining the Greek Artemis with pre-Greek fertility goddesses. Her cult at Ephesus was deeply rooted in the notion of life-giving power, suggesting that the many breasts symbolized abundant nourishment and fertility.However, more recent hypotheses challenge the breast interpretation. Some scholars propose that the objects are not anatomical at all but represent offerings or ritual items, such as gourds, often used in ancient fertility rites. Others suggest they could be amber or acorn-like pendants, possibly meant to invoke protective powers or symbolize abundance and bounty.One compelling theory, supported by archaeological analysis of earlier statues, is that the \"breasts\" might be rows of bull scrotums, commemorating animal sacrifices made in her honor. This theory finds some grounding in ancient practices, where votive offerings included preserved animal parts.Another hypothesis posits that the shapes were symbolic, meant to indicate celestial or astrological concepts rather than biological fertility. Artemis, as a lunar goddess, may have been associated with the heavens and the cyclical nature of the moon. In this reading, the strange protuberances could symbolize stars, moons, or other astral forms rather than reproductive organs, shifting Artemis from a mother goddess to a cosmic force of nature.A more recent hypothesis suggests that the rounded protuberances on the Ephesian Artemis may be stylized representations of beehives. This theory draws on the deep symbolic relationship between bees, feminine power, and divine wisdom in the ancient Mediterranean world.In several cultures, bees were associated with goddesses and priestesses, most notably the Melissae, or \"bee priestesses,\" who served various deities including Artemis, Demeter, and even the Delphic Oracle of Apollo. Artemis herself was occasionally linked to bees through inscriptions and myths that emphasized her role as a guardian of nature and a nurturer of hidden wisdom.The beehive theory adds a fascinating new layer to the understanding of Artemis's cult at Ephesus. Bees, and by extension hives, symbolize fertility, community, regeneration, and sacred knowledge, concepts that align well with Artemis's multifaceted nature as both a protector of virginity and a goddess of childbirth. The idea that her chest might display stylized hives rather than anatomical features or votive offerings challenges earlier fertility-only interpretations, suggesting instead that Artemis presided over a sacred ecology, where every element of nature was connected through divine order and maternal stewardship.This symbolic interpretation also repositions the Ephesian Artemis as a cosmic queen bee, overseeing the structured, mystical order of nature and life itself. Such a reading would explain her unearthly, rigid posture and the heavily adorned, almost architectural, stylization of her statues, not as depictions of the natural human form, but as sacred icons encoded with layers of meaning for the initiated. The beehive theory thus resonates with broader ancient themes of sacred geometry, female divinity, and the microcosmic order of nature within the divine feminine.The true meaning remains elusive, largely because the cult of the Ephesian Artemis was highly localized and her rituals closely guarded. What is clear, however, is that Artemis of Ephesus embodies a richly layered fusion of religious symbolism, blending themes of fertility, sacrifice, protection, and cosmic order into one of antiquity's most mysterious and enduring images.",
