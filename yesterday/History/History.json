    "description": "Being the wife of a wanted criminal in the 1920s was equal parts alluring and terrifying. You were constantly in danger, or at least your spouse was in danger of being shot on the street or “taken for a ride.” If you chose this life you were probably one of three kinds of woman. Someone who really had no clue what the man they loved did, chose to see what the man they loved did and pretended not to know about it or knew what they did and embraced it. For the most part women who married the bootleggers of prohibition turned a blind eye to their husband’s escapades for one reason or another. It took a special kind of personality, one that, it might be argued wasn’t that different from those that they were partners in life.Erin Finlen explains.Images to click on before you start:George Moran and Lucille: https://images.app.goo.gl/nTCYpeTnHW1Qt6bHACecelia Drucci: https://images.app.goo.gl/agLdrHV5DAwHnTpX6Hymie Weiss and Josephine Simard: https://images.app.goo.gl/XD61BpZUuxECbdXq7Dean O'Banion and Viola: https://images.app.goo.gl/WKR137gBQypWFiRD9Viola O’BanionViola O’Banion was born Viola Kaniff in Chicago, Illinois on March 27,1901. When she was school age she went to boarding or finishing school in Iowa. She was home on her Christmas break in December of 1920 and she and some girlfriends went to cafe on the North Side, where she caught the eye of Dean O’Banion. Viola could be described as the female of version of her husband. She had dark blond hair and blue eyes and an infectious attitude and penchant for trouble. She radiated a joy for life. Dean was instantly in love and the two were married in February of 1921.There is a real possibility that Viola had no idea her husband was in the bootlegging business. She even told a reporter who came to visit O’Banion when he was under house arrest pending the trial for the murder of John Duffy that there was no way he could have done it, the police just didn’t like him.The two vacationed together on the infamous trip where Dean is credited with finding the Tommy Gun and ordering some to be brought to Chicago, but there is no reason to suggest that she was involved with his criminal activities in anyway. When Dean was murdered she claimed that the only reason he ever carried a gun was for protection in the dangerous city, something Dean could have told her and she probably believed, it was a plausible reason in the city where money controlled the cops and the money was controlled by the gangsters. For better or worse the pair were a good match and both loved each other dearly. Viola would never be quite the same after his death.That’s not to say that she was lost her mischievous streak by any means. In 1926, she married a man on a dare only to discover he was already married and promptly divorce him. In 1929, she was arrested for driving over 66 mph through a residential neighborhood and using the sidewalks as well, an activity that her late husband had also engaged in. Then, in 1934 she watched as her sister jumped off a bridge. When her sister was rescued she accompanied her to the county hospital. They refused to say why her sister was in the water and Mrs. O’Banion Carter, as the papers called her, answered with, “I don’t like the police and we were just celebrating a wedding.” A dislike and distrust of policeman and a joyful outlook on life made her the perfect and possibly blind eyed wife to Dean O’Banion and his gangland kingdom. Josephine SimardFor the purposes of this article I am going to call Josephine the fiancé of Hymie Weiss, splitting her version of events and what can be proven cleanly down the middle. Marie Josephine Simard was, like Dean and Viola, a bubbly outgoing young woman who was born on October 23, 1902 in Massachusetts. She joined the Ziegfeld Follies in New York City, a comedy troupe of chorus girls, who were considered risqué at the time, and in the fall of 1925, the tour was visiting Chicago where she met Earl “Hymie” Weiss. It’s probable that the vivacious personality of Simard was what drew him to her, she brought out the good side of the otherwise angry, violent, and serious man, a much needed light after the death of his best friend the year before.There is a lot of speculation about the relationship that the pair actually had. Josephine said that she spent the happiest days of her life to that point with Weiss, that even though he was a bootlegger he enjoyed quiet nights at home with her and that if you didn’t know who he was you would never guess. At no point did she hide that she knew what he did or who he was, instead she said it didn’t matter because she loved him. Their friends all said that they were very happy together and a picture of the two in Miami, Florida taken between the winter of 1925 and fall 1926 shows an extremely happy couple. They were reported to have heated arguments but only because, as Rose Keefe says in her book, The Man Who Got Away, they were such different personalities. The famous scene in the 1931 film, The Public Enemy, where James Cagney shoves a grape fruit in Mae West’s face supposedly came from an incident where Weiss shoved an omelet in Josephine’s face because she was talking too much early in the morning. According to Josephine, the pair were so in love that they eloped in Florida in the winter of 1925, but she was never able to provide a marriage certificate, saying that Weiss had a priest brought to their room. Stating that she was his widow, she insisted that she had a right to his estate when he died. His mother and the executor of his will, Mary Weiss was not having it, going so far as to have her son in law, James Philip Monahan go get the car that Weiss had bought for her. The pair faced off in probate court, no small feat for the Follies Girl, since all signs point to Mary Weiss being a fierce woman who didn’t back down from a fight. The case was eventually dismissed. It is worth noting that Weiss was meticulous about his will. It makes sense seeing as he had terminal cancer. If the marriage was legally binding it’s doubtful that he would have neglected to add her to it.She never hid who she had married. Her second husband, Samuel Marx, remembered her as crying a lot when they met due to losing Weiss. For Simard it was either love or money that kept her with Weiss, not a notion that he wasn’t the bootlegging kingpin that he was. Most people at the time said it was the money, but from her heartfelt statement after his death, it’s clear she loved him dearly.  Cecilia DrucciThe wife of Vincent Drucci is actually harder to track than her husband. In fact, she is downright impossible to find any factual information on. There is no record of their marriage until she says at his funeral that they gave him a swell send off and yet, if you were to think of the kind of woman Drucci were to marry, it would be Cecilia. There isn’t much know about her, besides that she was blond and feisty. There is an anecdote that sees her threatening a dinner guest with a butchers knife. When a dressmaker was telling people that Drucci had robbed her store, he showed up with an unknown blond woman and told her to teach the woman a lesson. The woman turned the shop over and Drucci herded the customers to the backroom before the pair fled in a taxi. There is a chance that this woman was Cecilia. Although, blond doesn’t tell us much. While his friends were faithful to their partners once they found them, Drucci was not and was reputed to have a different blond on his arm every night.When Drucci was buried his wife said “We sure gave him a swell send off,” and then disappeared without a trace. There isn’t much to tell about her but Cecelia Drucci exemplifies the woman who worked alongside her husband in the Chicago Underworld. Lucille MoranGeorge Moran’s wife is not Cecilia Drucci nor is she Viola O’Banion. However, neither does she quite fit the same mold as Josephine Simard. She wasn’t a high strung, quick tempered moll, a naive young lady who had no idea what her husband did and she also wasn’t as willing to pretend that Moran didn’t have a criminal record that he was actively adding to during their marriage. She loved and supported her husband and knew what he was to the Chicago Underworld, it was less important to her though than the fact that he was a good husband and a great father to her child.Born in 1899, Lucille was a recently divorced mother of one when she met George, in 1923. He was instantly smitten with her according to their love story and, while she was at first worried that he wouldn’t accept her son, Moran was just as infatuated with him. The boy spoke French, which Moran had grown up speaking and helped him learn English.Though he seems to have been an ideal partner there was no hiding what he did for a living, especially when he was arrested on suspicion of attempting to assassinate Johnny Torrio. After that he moved to a hotel and when Weiss was assassinated in 1926, he was arrested there after he left the funeral without telling anyone and rumors abounded as to his future plans. Lucille was supportive, loving and there for every step of her husband’s life, even picking him up when he was released on bail or watching in court. Then, in 1929, the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre happened. She had to wait for news that he was alive and then he fled to Canada, leaving her and her son at the hotel, to be watched over by his underlings. When he returned, she tried to remain just as strong as she had been but after another trial in 1930, Moran was advised to leave Illinois all together and she had had enough. She decided that she couldn’t live like that anymore and served him divorce papers. And they all lived…Well, not happily ever after. The life of the women who called a gangster her husband was high stress and fraught with danger, whether they accepted it or not. Of the four women discussed only one didn’t see her marriage end in tragedy and it was the scare of doing so that made her finally pull the trigger on her divorce (so to speak). Viola, Josephine, Cecilia and Lucille were also, strangely, all perfect fits for the men they married, at least from a historical perspective. Viola and Dean, fun loving partners in life with hot tempers and a disrespect for the law. Josephine and Earl, volatile, quick tempered people who balanced each other out and brought out the best in each other. Cecilia and Vincent, who were so alike as to be almost uncanny. George and Lucille, each there for each other when they were needed, level headed and perseverant. Four different couples and four different but intriguing female figures of the 1920s. The site has been offering a wide variety of high-quality, free history content since 2012.

    "description": "The world of the Late Bronze Age was a dazzling network of powerful civilizations, bound together by trade, diplomacy, and shared technologies. As discussed in Part 1, the Hittites, Egyptians, Mycenaeans, and other major powers created an interconnected web of prosperity. Yet, by the end of the 12th century BCE, this world had crumbled. Entire cities lay in ruins, societies disintegrated, and long-established empires vanished from history. But what caused this collapse?To understand the causes it is important to explore the intricate and interwoven factors of environmental shifts, economic turmoil, military upheaval, and technological transitions, that created a perfect storm of crises, leading to one of the most dramatic periods of decline in human history.Terry Bailey explains. The Sea Peoples in ships during battle with the Egyptians. A depiction of a relief from the mortuary temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu. Environmental and climatic factorsArchaeological and palaeo-climatic evidence suggests that a series of severe droughts struck the Eastern Mediterranean during the late 13th and early 12th centuries BCE. Tree-ring analysis from Anatolia and pollen records from the Levant indicate a sharp decline in precipitation, leading to failed harvests and widespread famine.Lake sediments from Cyprus and the Dead Sea further corroborate this period of prolonged aridity. The Hittite and Egyptian records refer to grain shortages, hinting at growing food insecurity. The effects were catastrophic. Urban centers, which relied on stable agricultural output, suffered devastating food shortages, leading to depopulation, internal strife, and mass migrations. Trade routes became unstable as hunger forced people to move in search of sustenance, disrupting long-established economic patterns. In some cases, entire regions were abandoned, as evidenced by the decline of once-thriving settlements such as Emar in Syria. Economic decline and trade disruptionsThe Late Bronze Age economy depended on complex international trade networks that supplied essential raw materials. Bronze, the defining metal of the age, required a steady supply of copper and tin, elements that were often sourced from distant locations. When trade routes collapsed, so too did bronze production, crippling military and economic stability.Archaeological evidence from Ugarit, a major trading hub, shows that it was suddenly cut off from its usual trading partners before its destruction. Communications discovered in the ruins of Ugarit describe desperate appeals for aid and warnings of impending disaster. With trade in disarray, central authorities struggled to maintain control.Inflation and food shortages led to social unrest, as documented in letters from the Egyptian pharaohs lamenting the high cost of grain. The economic strain may have contributed to weakened state institutions, making them more vulnerable to internal and external threats. Warfare and invasionsPerhaps the most dramatic element of the Bronze Age Collapse was the wave of invasions and destruction that swept through the region. Chief among the aggressors was the enigmatic Sea Peoples, a confederation of warriors who attacked numerous cities across the Eastern Mediterranean. Egyptian inscriptions, such as those at Medinet Habu from the reign of Ramesses III, describe these seaborne raiders in battle, detailing their destruction of cities and their attempt to invade Egypt itself.Other major powers suffered even worse fates. The Hittite capital, Hattusa, was destroyed and abandoned, with no later reoccupation, signaling the total collapse of the Hittite Empire. The Mycenaean palaces in Greece were burned and abandoned, leading to a centuries-long decline in Greek civilization. The fall of Ugarit, documented in a final letter from its last ruler, shows the sudden and brutal nature of these attacks.The military infrastructure of these states was not prepared for such upheaval. Internal revolts, possibly by oppressed lower classes or mercenaries, further destabilized the already-weakened polities. The sheer scale and synchronization of these invasions suggest a combination of external aggression and internal fracturing. Technological and military shiftsThe changing nature of warfare may have also contributed to the collapse. The Late Bronze Age was dominated by chariot-based armies, which required large logistical support, training, and infrastructure. However, as societies became weaker and trade disruptions limited access to high-quality materials, the effectiveness of chariot warfare declined.At the same time, iron weaponry began to spread. While the transition from bronze to iron took time, some groups may have gained an advantage through the use of iron tools and weapons. The Philistines, a possible subset of the Sea Peoples, appear to have been early adopters of ironworking technology.Archaeological sites such as Ashkelon have revealed early iron artefacts, suggesting a gradual but significant shift in military capabilities. Additionally, shifts in military recruitment weakened traditional armies. Many rulers relied on foreign mercenaries, whose loyalty could be fickle. The breakdown of centralized authority may have meant that these warriors turned against their employers, contributing to the cycle of instability. The domino effect - Civilization in freefallOnce the collapse began, it rapidly spread across the Eastern Mediterranean. The destruction of key trade centers led to further economic and political breakdowns, creating a cascading effect. Archaeological evidence shows that entire regions were depopulated. In Greece, the Mycenaean palace complexes, including Pylos and Tiryns, were burned and abandoned. The Hittite heartland became a wasteland, and Ugarit ceased to exist.Egypt, while surviving, emerged from the crisis in a weakened state. Ramesses III's inscriptions claim victory over the Sea Peoples, but Egypt's empire shrank dramatically. The loss of territories in Canaan and the Levant marked the beginning of a long decline for the New Kingdom.The knowledge and administrative skills that had supported these civilizations were also lost. The collapse of writing systems, such as Linear B in Greece, marks a regression in literacy and bureaucratic administration. The world of vast interconnected states gave way to small, isolated communities struggling to rebuild. The end of an era and birth of the New WorldThe collapse of the Late Bronze Age was not the result of a single catastrophic event but rather a convergence of multiple, interwoven crises that overwhelmed even the most powerful civilizations of the era. Environmental stress, economic disintegration, military upheaval, and technological transitions combined to create an unprecedented period of societal collapse.Severe droughts led to widespread famine, weakening the agricultural and trade-based economies that had sustained the great empires. The disruption of trade routes not only crippled industries dependent on essential resources like tin and copper but also destabilized political structures, as rulers struggled to maintain control over increasingly desperate populations.At the same time, waves of invasions and internal revolts further shattered these fragile societies. The arrival of the Sea Peoples marked the final blow for many city-states, while the fall of the Mycenaean palaces, the destruction of Hattusa, and the obliteration of Ugarit signaled the disintegration of long-standing power centers. The changing nature of warfare marked by the decline of chariot-based armies and the slow but inevitable rise of iron weaponry ushered in a new era, leaving behind the remnants of a world once dominated by bronze.The aftermath of the collapse reshaped the geopolitical landscape of the Eastern Mediterranean. Egypt, though it survived, never regained its former dominance. The once-mighty Hittites disappeared entirely, while the Greek world plunged into centuries of economic and cultural regression. The loss of centralized administration, literacy, and trade networks meant that knowledge, technology, and governance had to be rebuilt almost from scratch.However, from this period of darkness, new societies eventually emerged. The Phoenicians, the Israelites, and the early Greek city-states would rise from the ruins, laying the groundwork for the Iron Age civilizations that followed.Ultimately, the great upheaval of the Late Bronze Age is a solid indication of the fragility of complex societies. It serves as a powerful reminder that even the most interconnected and prosperous civilizations are vulnerable to the cascading effects of environmental stress, economic turmoil, and military conflict. While the Bronze Age world may have vanished, its legacy endures in the lessons it offers about resilience, adaptation, and the ever-changing nature of human history.In Part 3, we will explore the aftermath of the collapse: how survivors rebuilt, what new civilizations rose from the ashes, and how the lessons of the Bronze Age Collapse continue to resonate in history today. The site has been offering a wide variety of high-quality, free history content since 2012.

As indicated in the main text, these groups attacked and contributed to the downfall of powerful states such as the Hittite Empire, Mycenaean Greece, and the Egyptian New Kingdom. The origins and identity of the Sea Peoples remain a topic of intense scholarly debate, as they left no written records of their own, and much of what is known comes from Egyptian and other contemporary sources, particularly inscriptions by Pharaoh Ramesses III, which potentially could be tainted with bias.One prevailing theory suggests that the Sea Peoples were not a single unified culture but rather a coalition of various displaced or migratory groups. The upheavals of the late Bronze Age, including climate change, famine, internal strife, and the collapse of trade networks, may have forced numerous populations to seek new lands and resources, leading to waves of seaborne invasions. Among the names recorded in Egyptian sources, such as the Medjay, Sherden, Lukka, and Peleset (often identified with the Philistines), it is possible that the Sea Peoples included displaced Mycenaeans, Anatolian groups fleeing the collapse of the Hittite Empire, and even people from the central Mediterranean, such as Sardinia or Sicily.Archaeological and textual evidence suggests that the Sea Peoples were both warriors and settlers, with some groups integrating into the societies they attacked. For example, the Peleset are thought to have settled in Canaan, eventually forming the Philistine culture. Other groups may have contributed to the cultural and demographic shifts that marked the transition from the Bronze Age to the early Iron Age.While their exact origins remain elusive, the Sea Peoples are best understood as a diverse and fluid collection of migrants, adventurers, and raiders whose actions reshaped the ancient Mediterranean world.",
