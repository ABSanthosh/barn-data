With an introductory episode to her new season, \"The Old Man is Still Alive,\"  which covers the late careers of Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford, Howard Hawks, Vincente Minnelli and ten other directors who began their careers in the silent or early sound eras, and were still making movies in the 1960s, ‘70s and ‘80s, in spite of the challenges posed by massive cultural changes and their advanced age. In this mini-episode we’ll discuss the parallels between this history and today, from the tech industry takeover of Hollywood to the late work of Coppola and Scorsese; the interview with George Cukor that inspired the title of this season; the Orson Welles-Peter Bogdanovich-Quentin Tarantino connection that informs the way we think about “old man” movies, and much more.

    "description": "Charlemagne, or Charles the Great (748–814), looms large in history as a warrior king, a unifier of Europe, and a patron of culture and education. Ruling as King of the Franks, and later crowned as the first Holy Roman Emperor, his reign marked a pivotal chapter in European history. Known as the \"Father of Europe,\" his influence transcended his lifetime, laying the foundations for modern Western civilization.Terry Bailey explains. A depiction of Pope Leo III crowning Charlemagne.Major campaigns and victoriesCharlemagne's military conquests were central to his legacy. Over his reign, he expanded the Frankish Empire significantly, uniting much of Western and Central Europe. The Saxon Wars (772–804)One of Charlemagne's longest and most grueling campaigns was the subjugation of the pagan Saxons. This series of conflicts, lasting over three decades, was marked by fierce resistance and brutal retaliations. His conquest of Saxony was not just military but also religious, as he sought to Christianize the region. The Massacre of Verden, in October 782, where Charlemagne reportedly executed 4,500 Saxons, underscores the ferocity of these wars. Despite the bloodshed, he succeeded in integrating Saxony into his empire. The Lombard campaign (773–774)Charlemagne's Italian ambitions were realized through his victory over the Lombards, a Germanic kingdom threatening the papacy. Responding to a plea from Pope Adrian I, Charlemagne crossed the Alps and besieged Pavia, the Lombard capital. He crowned himself King of the Lombards, becoming the first ruler to hold both Frankish and Lombard titles. Campaigns in Spain (778–801)Charlemagne's attempts to expand into the Iberian Peninsula met mixed results. His expedition in 778 ended with the infamous defeat at Roncevaux Pass, immortalized in the epic poem The Song of Roland. However, he eventually established the Spanish March, a buffer zone against Islamic expansion, solidifying his influence south of the Pyrenees. The Avar campaigns (788–803)In Central Europe, Charlemagne waged successful campaigns against the Avars, a nomadic people based in the Danube basin. Their defeat allowed him to seize immense wealth and consolidate control over modern-day Austria and Hungary. Political ambitions and governanceCharlemagne's political vision was as expansive as his military ambitions. He sought to create a unified Christian empire, which he achieved through conquest, diplomacy, and administrative reform. The coronations as the Holy Roman EmperorOn Christmas Day, 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as Emperor of the Romans. This act symbolized the fusion of Roman, Christian, and Germanic traditions and marked the revival of the Western Roman Empire. It solidified Charlemagne's authority and established a precedent for the relationship between the church and the state. Administrative reforms and cultural revivalCharlemagne restructured his empire to ensure efficient governance. He divided it into regions called counties, overseen by counts, and employed royal agents known as missi dominici to maintain oversight. These reforms improved communication and justice across his vast territory. Additionally, Charlemagne's reign sparked the Carolingian Renaissance, a revival of learning and culture. He established schools, preserved classical texts, and promoted literacy among clergy and nobility. His court at Aachen became a center of intellectual and artistic activity. Strengths and WeaknessesCharlemagne was a visionary leader with remarkable strengths, but his reign was not without flaws. Charlemagne strengthsAs one of history's most influential leaders, Charlemagne showcased an extraordinary blend of military genius, visionary leadership, and cultural patronage. His campaigns across Europe revealed an unparalleled strategic acumen and adaptability, enabling him to expand his empire and establish dominance over diverse territories. Whether facing formidable foes or navigating complex geopolitical landscapes, Charlemagne's military prowess secured his place as one of the great tacticians of his era.Beyond the battlefield, Charlemagne's unifying vision set him apart. He skillfully integrated disparate peoples and cultures into a cohesive empire, fostering a sense of unity that transcended linguistic and regional divides. By promoting a centralized administration and encouraging loyalty through just governance, he laid the groundwork for the Carolingian Empire's enduring stability.Charlemagne's patronage of learning and culture further cemented his legacy. Recognizing the transformative power of education, he spearheaded initiatives that revived intellectual pursuits in the medieval world. His support for the arts and establishment of schools contributed to the Carolingian Renaissance, a cultural revival that preserved and advanced knowledge for future generations. In blending martial prowess, visionary governance, and a passion for enlightenment, Charlemagne left an indelible mark on European history. Charlemagne's weaknessesAlthough Charlemagne is often hailed as the father of medieval Europe and built an empire that spanned much of Western Europe, his reign was not without its flaws. One of his most criticized actions was his brutality in war. A prime example is the Massacre of Verden, as indicated he ordered the execution of 4,500 Saxons, a decision that alienated many of the conquered peoples. His military campaigns, while successful in expanding his empire, were marked by harsh methods that sowed resentment in some regions.Another weakness of Charlemagne's reign was the challenge of succession. Upon his death, his empire was divided among his sons, a move that ultimately led to fragmentation. This division weakened the long-term stability of the empire and made it more susceptible to external threats. The lack of a clear, unified succession plan contributed to the decline of his empire, limiting the lasting impact of his centralized rule.Charlemagne's religious policies also left a complicated legacy. His efforts to Christianize the pagan peoples under his control, although pivotal in spreading Christianity, created lasting tensions. His forceful approach to conversion often led to religious intolerance, alienating those who resisted or adhered to other beliefs. These policies, while shaping the religious landscape of Europe, also fueled conflict and division. Global influenceCharlemagne's influence extended far beyond his lifetime, despite these weaknesses, with the influence remaining profound. His reign laid the foundation for the modern concept of Europe, both culturally and politically. His emphasis on education and governance set a precedent for future European rulers. The Holy Roman Empire, although fragmented, would become a cornerstone of medieval European politics for centuries. Today, Charlemagne is celebrated as a symbol of unity and cultural revival. The Charlemagne Prize, awarded annually for contributions to European unity, reflects his enduring legacy and the lasting impact of his vision for Europe.In conclusion, Charlemagne's life and reign epitomize the transformative power of vision and leadership in shaping the course of history. As a warrior, he reshaped the geopolitical landscape of Europe, creating a vast empire that unified diverse peoples and cultures under a single banner. His relentless campaigns, whether in Saxony, Lombardy, or the Avar territories, demonstrated not only his military brilliance but also his unwavering commitment to expanding and securing his realm. These victories, however, were not without their costs, as the methods employed sometimes left scars of brutality and resentment that echoed through history.As a ruler, Charlemagne's administrative reforms and promotion of education and culture forged the foundations of a more cohesive and enlightened Europe. His efforts during the Carolingian Renaissance revitalized intellectual pursuits and preserved classical knowledge, bridging the ancient and medieval worlds. His court at Aachen became a beacon of learning and innovation, symbolizing his dedication to fostering progress and unity. Despite his flaws, such as the divisive succession plan and the harshness of his religious policies, his achievements in governance and cultural revival remain unparalleled.The coronation of Charlemagne as the first Holy Roman Emperor marked a defining moment in European history, intertwining the destinies of church and state and establishing a legacy of cooperation and conflict between these two powers. This act not only affirmed his authority but also set the stage for centuries of European politics, influencing the structure and governance of future empires.However, Charlemagne's weaknesses, which were often ruthless in method, the challenges of succession, and the tensions caused by his forceful Christianization efforts, should not overshadow his monumental contributions. Instead, they highlight the complexity of his rule and the intricacies of forging a lasting empire in a turbulent era. While his empire eventually fragmented, the cultural and political seeds he planted endured, influencing the development of modern Europe.Today, Charlemagne is remembered as a symbol of unity, resilience, and cultural flourishing. His legacy lives on not only in the institutions and traditions that trace their origins to his reign but also in the broader idea of Europe as a shared cultural and political entity, including the Charlemagne Prize which underscores his enduring influence and the relevance of his vision in contemporary times.Ultimately, Charlemagne's life and reign serve as a testament to the profound impact one leader can have on the world. By merging military prowess, visionary governance, and cultural patronage, Charlemagne earned his place in history as the \"Father of Europe\", a title that reflects his pivotal role in shaping the continent's destiny and identity. His legacy continues to inspire, reminding us of the enduring power of unity, leadership, and cultural advancement. The site has been offering a wide variety of high-quality, free history content for over 12 years.

    "link": "http://www.historyisnowmagazine.com/blog/2025/2/1/a-society-without-women-sex-amp-gender-in-the-wild-west",
    "description": "What would a society without women look like? Any conjecture is fanciful and contrived, but there has been a period in American history where an analogous situation prevailed for a sufficient period to provide thoughtful grist – the settlement of the American West. Fewer than one in twenty pioneers to California during the early Gold Rush is female. Even in 1853, only some 8,000 of San Francisco’s 50,000 residents were women. Well into the 1880s, men made up almost two-thirds of California’s pioneer population.Terry Hamburg explains. Emigrants Crossing the Plains. Drawn by F.O.C. Darley, engraved by Henry Bryan Hall.“You have no idea how few women we have here, a San Francisco lawyer writes to his sister back home in 1849,” and if one makes her appearance in the street, all stop, stand, and look. The latest fashion is to carry them in their arms (the streets are incredibly muddy). This we see every day.”The gender imbalance is a subject of marvel to every observer then and since. The world’s oldest profession thrives in this hormonal tsunami. In the course of 1849, the hamlet of San Francisco’s bolts to 20,000, of which it is estimated 1000 are women - and two-thirds of those work in or manage brothels. Most men pouring into the city are in their raging testosterone twenties and have been deprived of traditional sex for at least six months.Some of the most successful and powerful women in mid-nineteenth century America live in the frontier where they are vastly outnumbered by men and subject to a more primitive, unfiltered form of masculinity. Madams, in particular, parlay their business into fortune and influence. “The only aristocracy we had here at the time,” remarks Caleb T. Fay, a leading San Francisco politician during the Gold Rush, “were the gamblers and prostitutes.” A brothel proprietress made her money off patriarchy, but that success is a challenge to it as much as an accommodation.  Exporting VirtueIt was a simple proposition. Plenty of California men - most believed rich or soon to be so - without women. Ladies possessing the adventure and pluck to travel to that far-off land might find an ideal situation. “Every man thought every woman in that day a beauty,” a Sacramento woman confesses to her diary. “Even I have had men come forty miles over the mountains, just to look at me, and I was never called a handsome woman, in the best day, even by most ardent admirers.”The men needed both the carnal and the cultural. Females would deliver a healthy dose of virtue to tame the savage beast. “We do not wish to say, or even imply, that San Francisco is the wickedest and most immoral city in the world,” historian Benjamin E. Lloyd mused in 1876, “but it has not yet overcome the immoral habits contracted in the days when the inhabitants were nearly all males, and had nothing to restrain them from engaging in the most vicious practices; when there were no mothers to chide their waywardness and say in winning tones: “My son go not in the way of evil” and fewer virtuous sisters to welcome brothers home, and by their loving kindness and noble lives, to teach them to cease from sinning.” Readers applauded the sentiment of James Wyld in his 1849 Guide to the Gold Country of California: “Society without woman is like an edifice built on sand. Woman, to society, is like the cement to the stone. The society has no such cement; its elements float to and fro on the excited, turbulent, hurried life of California immigrants.”There are formal schemes to fill this moral vacuum. The most celebrated is hatched in 1849 by Eliza Farnham, author and former matron of the female section of Sing Sing Prison. She has skin in the California game. Her late husband leaves a large tract of land near Santa Cruz that she is keen to develop. Farnham concocts an ambitious plan: organize a group of well-recommended marriageable women that would “bring their refinement and kindly cares and powers” to the rough-hewn society of male fortune seekers. Ideologically, Farnham goes farther than most feminists of the age, advocating the natural superiority of women. She is prominent, and so are her public supporters, the likes of Horace Greeley and William Cullen Bryant, editors of The New-York Tribune and The New York Evening Post, and Henry Ward Beecher, the renowned clergyman and abolitionist.Farnham shuttles between cities on the Atlantic coast, addressing meetings, examining applicants, and giving press interviews. Soon, she could announce that more than 130 women had “signified” a desire to join up. The New York Tribune praises her and the “precious cargo . . . on an errand of mercy to the golden land.” Editors on both coasts are captivated by the notion. In California, there is joy. One local mining newspaper reports that “smiles of anticipation wreathed the countenance of every bachelor in town.” However, Farnham is having difficulty finding suitable clients and then closing a deal that yanks young ladies from the comforts of family and friends to trek halfway around the world on a wild speculation, and for a big fee - payable in advance, thank you. No refunds. The ballyhooed April launch is postponed. By June, she is ready to give up the plan and sail with a scant three prospects. Disappointed supporters complain that her personal standards for recruits may have been too high, along with the price tag. TheAlta California accepts the news graciously: “The will is always taken for the deed, and bachelors will unquestionably cherish the liveliest of feelings of regard for the lady who so warmly exerted herself to bring a few spareribs to the market.” Farnham expresses no regrets. After experiencing “the moral and social poverty” of California for six years, she is “grateful that my endeavors failed.” More womenThere are other grand plans to civilize the Wild West by estrogen. A few years later, Sarah Pellet, a noted advocate of temperance, abolition, and woman’s rights pursues a scheme for “amelioration of the condition of Californians.” Again, the plan looks solid on paper: export 5,000 “respectable, marriageable New England girls” to be recommended by the Sons of Temperance as “worthy girls.” The Sons of Temperance in California agrees to serve as guardians upon their arrival. If this initiative works, there are plans to up the contingent to 10,000. Unfortunately, too few worthy girls are willing to be shipped and the plan is abandoned, again breaking miners’ hearts.The gradual but relentless march of progress will eventually balance the genders in California. 50-50 is the order of nature. Terry Hamburg is director emeritus of the Cypress Lawn Cemetery Heritage Foundation. His recently published book Land of the Dead: How The West Changed Death In America explores how the demands of survival and adaptation in the Gold Rush western migration changed a multitude of American customs, including the way we bury and grieve for our ancestors. California and San Francisco serve as case studies. Visit his author page: https://www.terryhamburgbooks.com.",
