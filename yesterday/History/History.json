With an introductory episode to her new season, \"The Old Man is Still Alive,\"  which covers the late careers of Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford, Howard Hawks, Vincente Minnelli and ten other directors who began their careers in the silent or early sound eras, and were still making movies in the 1960s, ‘70s and ‘80s, in spite of the challenges posed by massive cultural changes and their advanced age. In this mini-episode we’ll discuss the parallels between this history and today, from the tech industry takeover of Hollywood to the late work of Coppola and Scorsese; the interview with George Cukor that inspired the title of this season; the Orson Welles-Peter Bogdanovich-Quentin Tarantino connection that informs the way we think about “old man” movies, and much more.

    "link": "http://www.historyisnowmagazine.com/blog/2025/1/30/from-red-to-clear-the-story-of-how-coca-cola-was-secretly-delivered-to-the-ussr",
    "description": "Coca-Cola is undoubtedly the most famous soft-drink beverage in the world, and we are all intimately familiar with the iconic red, white, and black color combination. But did you know that Coca-Cola at one point shed its iconic color scheme to sneak its way into the Soviet Union?It is honestly difficult to imagine Coca-Cola being any other color; it's hardly recognizable, and yet that was precisely the point. All the effort that went into creating what we know today as “Coca-Cola Clear” was done to quench the thirst of a prominent Red Russian.Here is the story of how the iconic beverage became a small sweet spot in the deteriorating East-West relationship of the Cold War. Chaveendra Dunuwille explains. Georgy Zhukov, around 1960. Source: Mil.ru, available here. Coca-Cola and World War II Allied Forces Before we get into the actual story, it is important that we comprehend how important Coca-Cola was during the war and its profound impact on both sides of the conflict.According to Coca-Cola, the company began building its global network in the 1920s, and it significantly expanded during World War II thanks to the visionary thinking of then Coca-Cola president Robert Woodruff. The Woodruff instructed the company to ensure that every American serviceman and woman should be able to get their hands on a bottle of Coke for 5 cents, wherever they were and no matter how much it cost the company. This declaration ended up costing the company $83.2 million in today’s dollars. But Coca-Cola would agree that it was money well spent.Coca-Cola was seen as an integral part of maintaining morale among US forces in all theaters of the conflict. During the war, Coca-Cola partnered with the United Services Organization (USO) in 1941 and played an important role in the American war effort as a much-needed morale booster for the young GIs. In 1943, General Eisenhowerordered over 3 million bottles of Coca-Cola to North Africa and requested supplies to keep refilling over 6 million bottles every month. In the Pacific theater, when Richard Bong set the American air-to-air victories record, General Henry ‘Hap’ Arnold gifted the aviator with 2 cases of Coca-Cola as a reward. In another instance, the very mention of the name Coca-Cola saved Lt Col. Robert \"Rosie\" Rosenthal’s life. After being shot down in one of his mission, Roshental was intercepted by advancing Soviet forces. To avoid being mistaken for a German pilot, he began to yell \"Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, Lucky Strike, Coca Cola, bombing Berlin.\" This allowed the Soviets to recognize him as an American and helped him return to friendly lines. The show Masters of the Air also features Lt. Rosenthal’s interactions with the Soviets. Whether it be Europe, the Pacific, or North Africa, the young GIs could always count on a cool, refreshing bottle of Coca-Cola to remind them of the “taste of home.” In one of their letters home, a US soldier remarked, “If anyone were to ask us what we are fighting for, we think half of us would answer, the right to buy Coca-Cola again.” - Mark Pendergrast, For God, Country and Coca-Cola (New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1993)Coca-Cola’s ad campaigns of the time heavily leaned on this rhetoric and featured almost exclusively military personnel. Today, these decisions can be credited for fostering the long-standing good relationship between Coca-Cola and the US military.  In order to keep up with the never-ending demand, the company built over 64 bottling plants across the world and sent over 200 employees to maintain the facilities. The employees that got the crates to the front lines were named the “Coca-Cola Colonels.” While they were civilians, they were issued military uniforms when operating on the front lines and given the rank of technical observer. The Coca-Cola Colonels often endured the same dangers the soldiers faced, and unfortunately, three of them were killed in action.By the end of the war, Allied service personnel had consumed over 5 billion bottles of Coca-Cola; the company had become a quintessential part of the American identity, and the stage was set for its global expansion. Nazi Germany Much like in the US, Coca-Cola was incredibly popular in Germany as well. By 1929 Coca-Cola was being bottled and drunk in Germany, and by 1940, Coca-Cola was the undisputed soft-drink king in Germany, enjoyed by all levels of German society. According to some legends, Hitler himself was rumored to indulge in Coca-Cola while relaxing to watch Hollywood movies.It would seem that the Atalanta-based company was unfazed and turned a blind eye to the events that were unfolding in the name of business. The company continued to supply its German subsidiary with syrup and other supplies during the early days of the war, and the head of the German subsidiary, Max Keith, is reported to have toured the facilities in occupied Holland and France to take over their businesses. However, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the US officially entered World War II, and American companies were ordered to immediately halt all business with the enemy. As a result, Coca-Cola HQ cut off its supply of syrup to Germany, leaving Keith stranded and Coca-Cola’s GmBH on the verge of collapse. But ever resourceful, Keith worked with his chemists to develop a recipe that cleverly worked its way around wartime rationing by using leftovers like fruit shavings and apple fibers. While it may sound unappetizing by modern standards, the new product sold over three million cases and saved Coca-Cola GmBH. After the war, Coca-Cola refined the recipe and reintroduced this drink in April 1955, making its way to the US in 1958. This drink is none other than Fanta. Breaching the Iron CurtainIt's 1945; World War II has ended, and a new war is on the horizon, a Cold War. The old world order had collapsed, replaced by the clash of ideologies between the two new superpowers, the US and the USSR. With its actions in World War II, Coca-Cola identified itself around the world as an icon of American culture, and this did not go on well with the Soviet Union. Despite the colors aligning, Coca-Cola’s sweetness could not breach the Iron Curtain as the Soviets viewed it as a tool of western imperialism and wanted to stave off a ‘Cocacolanization’ of the Soviet people.However, it was during the war that a prominent Russian general, one Georgy Konstantionvich Zhukov, developed a taste for Coke that he just couldn’t seem to shake. General Zhukov is no ordinary general; he was a marshal of the Soviet Union who oversaw some of the Red Army’s fiercest battles, including the legendary Battle of Kursk. He would go on to become the 1st Commander of the Soviet occupation zone in Germany and later the Minister of Defense. Despite all the accolades and the high position in the USSR, not even he could enjoy a bottle of the famed American drink without great personal cost. Thus, he devised a clever plan that would allow him to enjoy his guilty pleasure without getting into hot water with the Communist Party.Zhukov communicated to his US counterparts that if the iconic caramel coloring could be removed, he could pass the drink off as vodka, arguably Russia’s most famous beverage. As an added layer of security, he also mentioned that the Coke should not be filled in its usual bottles, lest some curious eyes recognize the distinct shape.General Mark W. Clark communicated Zhukov’s request to President Truman, who then passed on the message to James Forley, the Chairman of the Coca-Cola Export Corporation. After some tinkering, the chemists at Coca-Cola managed to produce a clear variant of the iconic drink and filled it in unmarked straight bottles complete with a white lid that included a red star. Zhukov took the delivery of 50 of these Clear Coke crates, and the rest remains a mystery. What happened to the Bottles?We honestly don’t know what happened to those 50 crates. The fate of the Clear Coke seems to be one of those moments in history that have seeped through the cracks. Perhaps Zhukov indulged in guilty pleasure? Or was it confiscated by the Soviets? We may never know. Did the efforts pay-off for Coca-Cola and the US?In retrospect, you could say that the effort to make the Clear Coke and deliver it to Zhukov didn’t really pay off in the long or short term for Coca-Cola or the United States. While Zhukov would have no doubt been personally thankful to his old American colleagues for delivering him the Coca-Cola, the interaction is relegated to history as an interesting footnote, and it did not help mend the deteriorating US-Soviet relations of the period. At the same time, despite trade restrictions being lowered over time, Coca-Cola was effectively locked out of the Russian market due to clever marketing by their rival PepsiCo, involving the then Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev (a story for another time). Pepsi effectively maintained a monopoly in the Russian market up until 1980 when Coke came into Russia through the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Can you get Clear Coke today?   Yes, you can. But Coca-Cola Clear is a Japan exclusive product. Its available in many major Japanese retail stores such as Lawson and Seven-Eleven. But thanks to online shopping and worldwide delivery services, you can enjoy this beverage from almost anywhere in the world.   Find that piece of interest?

    "description": "Few figures in history have reshaped the world map as profoundly as Genghis Khan, (Chinggis Khan), the legendary founder of the Mongol Empire. Born as Temüjin in 1162 near the Onon River in modern-day Mongolia, Genghis Khan forged a legacy through unyielding ambition, military genius, and unparalleled leadership. His rise from obscurity to becoming the \"Universal Ruler\" of a vast empire spanning from the Pacific Ocean to Eastern Europe remains one of history's most remarkable stories.Terry Bailey explains. A depiction of Temüjin being proclaimed as Genghis Khan.Early life and rise to powerTemüjin's early years were fraught with adversity. Following the death of his father, he and his family were cast out by their tribe, leaving them to survive in harsh conditions. Despite these struggles, Temüjin demonstrated an early aptitude for leadership by forging alliances and consolidating power among the fragmented Mongol tribes. In 1206, after years of tribal warfare, Temüjin united the Mongol clans under his leadership and was declared Genghis Khan, meaning \"Universal Ruler.\" This unification marked the birth of the Mongol Empire and the beginning of an era of unparalleled conquest. Genghis Khan: The mastermind of conquestGenghis Khan's military campaigns reshaped the course of history, marked by strategic brilliance, adaptability, and psychological warfare that left lasting imprints across continents. His ability to combine superior tactics, highly mobile cavalry, and an acute understanding of his enemies' weaknesses made him a formidable conqueror whose empire spanned vast regions.In 1211, Genghis Khan turned his sights on the wealthy Jin dynasty of northern China. The campaign, which lasted until 1215, showcased his mastery of warfare. Utilizing his highly mobile cavalry, Genghis overwhelmed the Jin armies with swift and unpredictable attacks. In 1215, the Mongols captured Zhongdu, modern-day Beijing, in a decisive victory that demonstrated the Khan's capacity to adapt his strategies to suit the terrain and enemy defenses. This conquest was not just a military success but a significant economic windfall, solidifying Mongol control over one of the wealthiest regions of Asia.The Khwarazmian campaign of 1219–1221 is another testament to Genghis Khan's strategic acumen. Provoked by a diplomatic insult from the Khwarazmian ruler, he launched a devastating assault on the Central Asian empire. Cities like Samarkand and Bukhara were annihilated, with the Mongols employing siege engines and psychological tactics to spread fear and ensure swift capitulation. This campaign not only punished the Khwarazmian Empire but also opened up the Silk Road for Mongol dominance, enhancing trade and communication across the empire.Genghis Khan's ambitions extended westward into the Caucasus and Eastern Europe during the 1220s, in addition to, returning to campaigning in the regions of China. His forces defeated Georgian and Russian armies, leaving a trail of fear and destruction that reverberated throughout the region. These incursions laid the groundwork for future Mongol expansions into Europe, underscoring the global impact of Genghis Khan's campaigns.Through his conquests, Genghis Khan demonstrated unparalleled military genius, transforming the Mongol tribes into a unified force that conquered some of the world's most formidable civilizations. His campaigns were not only feats of military strategy but also harbingers of cultural and economic transformations that shaped the medieval world. Political ambitions and governanceGenghis Khan's vision for his empire extended far beyond the battlefield. While his conquests reshaped the political map of his time, his true ambition lay in creating a unified and stable empire that could endure. To achieve this, he implemented innovative governance strategies that set the Mongol Empire apart from its contemporaries.One cornerstone of Genghis Khan's rule was his commitment to meritocracy. He valued loyalty and skill above all else, often promoting individuals based on their abilities rather than their lineage or social standing. This approach fostered a sense of opportunity and fairness, encouraging talented individuals from diverse backgrounds to contribute to the empire's success.Legal reform also played a crucial role in his vision. Genghis Khan introduced the Yassa, a comprehensive legal code that emphasized order, discipline, and loyalty. The Yassa served as the backbone of Mongol governance, providing clear guidelines that applied to all subjects of the empire, regardless of their origin.Cultural tolerance was another defining feature of his leadership. Under Genghis Khan, the Mongol Empire became a mosaic of religious and cultural diversity. Conquered peoples were allowed to retain their traditions, fostering a sense of inclusion and stability within the empire's vast and varied population.Finally, Genghis Khan revolutionized trade and communication through the establishment of the Yam system. This early postal and trade network spanned the empire's immense territory, enabling the swift exchange of information and goods. The Yam not only strengthened governance but also facilitated the flourishing of commerce and cultural exchange, laying the groundwork for the interconnected world we know today.Through these strategies, Genghis Khan transformed the Mongol Empire into more than just a military powerhouse—it became a model of governance that blended innovation, inclusivity, and pragmatism. Strengths and WeaknessesStrengths:Genghis Khan, one of history's most formidable conquerors, possessed strengths that set him apart as a military leader, statesman, and visionary. His unparalleled ability to adapt tactics to diverse terrains and opponents demonstrated his military genius. Whether navigating the open steppes or engaging in siege warfare against fortified cities, Genghis Khan's strategies consistently overwhelmed his adversaries. His keen understanding of the battlefield enabled the Mongol army to outmaneuver and out-think foes, ensuring victory even against numerically superior forces.Beyond the battlefield, Genghis Khan's charismatic leadership played a pivotal role in his success. He inspired unwavering loyalty among his followers, forging a sense of unity that endured even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. This loyalty was not just born of fear or brute force but stemmed from his ability to recognise talent, reward merit, and create a shared vision for his people. By integrating conquered peoples into his ranks and promoting based on ability rather than lineage, he built a dynamic and loyal coalition.As a statesman, Genghis Khan was remarkably visionary. He understood that conquest alone was insufficient to sustain an empire. His emphasis on governance, trade, and diplomacy transformed the Mongol Empire into a thriving and interconnected realm. He established legal codes, promoted religious tolerance, and fostered trade across the Silk Road, creating a legacy that reshaped Eurasian commerce and culture for generations. His blend of military brilliance and strategic foresight ensured that the ideas and concepts of his empire endured long after his time, leaving an indelible mark on world history. Weaknesses:While Genghis Khan's name evokes images of unparalleled power and conquest, his legacy is not without its darker facets and inherent vulnerabilities. One of the most prominent criticisms of his reign is the sheer brutality that characterized his campaigns. Genghis Khan's military strategies often prioritized the swift and total subjugation of cities and populations, leaving behind a trail of widespread destruction and staggering loss of life. Entire towns were razed to the ground, with survivors frequently left to spread tales of terror that would preemptively weaken the resolve of other potential adversaries. This reputation as a ruthless conqueror ensured compliance from some, but it also fostered enduring resentment and fear, casting a long shadow over his achievements.Another significant weakness of Genghis Khan's empire lay in its dependence on his successors. The Mongol Empire, despite its extraordinary expansion under his leadership, was inherently fragile. Its stability was deeply tied to the competence and unity of those who inherited the mantle of leadership. Following his death, the vast territory he had unified began to fracture under the weight of internal power struggles and conflicting ambitions among his descendants. This fragmentation diluted the empire's might, preventing it from sustaining the cohesion and dominance that marked Genghis Khan's era.These weaknesses underscore the complex and multifaceted nature of Genghis Khan's legacy. His ability to build one of history's largest empires is undeniable, but the human cost and the challenges of maintaining such a vast dominion reveal the limits of even the most formidable conquests. LegacyWhen Genghis Khan died in 1227, the Mongol Empire stretched across millions of square miles. His descendants continued his expansion, creating the largest contiguous empire in history. Despite the destruction he wrought, Genghis Khan also catalyzed cultural exchange, trade, and innovation. The Mongol Empire's Pax Mongolica era fostered the exchange of ideas and goods along the Silk Road, influencing the development of the modern world.Genghis Khan's life and achievements represent a paradoxical legacy that continues to evoke both awe and controversy. On the one hand, he was a conqueror of unparalleled ambition, a visionary leader who united disparate tribes into a cohesive force that transformed the medieval world. His military strategies reshaped the map of Eurasia, and his governance innovations laid the groundwork for global trade and cultural exchange. As indicated the Pax Mongolica ushered in an era of unprecedented connectivity, enabling the transfer of ideas, technologies, and goods across continents, planting seeds for the modern interconnected world.On the other hand, the human cost of his conquests was staggering. Cities were reduced to rubble, millions lost their lives, and his empire was built on a foundation of fear and subjugation. The brutality that characterized his campaigns cast a long shadow, leaving scars that resonate through history. Furthermore, the empire he painstakingly constructed was ultimately unable to withstand the centrifugal forces of internal division, underscoring the fragility of even the most monumental achievements.Genghis Khan's legacy defies simple categorization. He was simultaneously a destroyer and a builder, a warlord and a statesman. His life demonstrates the heights of human ambition and ingenuity, as well as the depths of destruction that such ambition can entail. Few figures in history have shaped the world so profoundly, and fewer still have left a legacy as complex and enduring. Whether viewed as a hero, a tyrant, or both, Genghis Khan remains an indelible force in the tapestry of human history—an emblem of both the transformative potential and the devastating consequences of unyielding ambition. The site has been offering a wide variety of high-quality, free history content for over 12 years.

By the time of his death in 1227, Genghis Khan's conquests had resulted in the control of an estimated 24 million square kilometers (9.27 million square miles) of territory.This expanse stretched from modern-day China and Korea in the east to Eastern Europe in the west, including parts of Central Asia, the Middle East, and Russia. After his death, the Mongol Empire continued to expand under his successors, eventually reaching approximately 33 million square kilometers (12.74 million square miles) at its peak. Point of interest:Genghis Khan's genetic lineageIt is estimated that approximately 0.5% of the world's male population, or about 16 million men, can trace their lineage back to Genghis Khan through their Y chromosome. This estimation stems from a genetic study published in 2003 by a research team led by geneticist Chris Tyler-Smith. The study identified a specific Y-chromosomal lineage prevalent across regions that were historically part of the Mongol Empire. Key factors supporting the estimateHistorical Polygamy: Genghis Khan and his descendants had numerous offspring, as Mongol rulers often engaged in polygamy and had many concubines.Geographical Spread: The Mongol Empire was the largest contiguous empire in history, spreading across Asia and parts of Europe. This facilitated the wide dissemination of this genetic lineage.Y-Chromosome Inheritance: The study focused on a unique genetic marker in the Y-chromosome, which is passed almost unchanged from father to son. Broader Context:While the 0.5% refers to men directly linked to the Y-chromosomal lineage, the total number of people (including women) who could be connected to Genghis Khan through other ancestral lines is likely much higher. However, this is harder to quantify due to the complexities of non-paternal lineage tracing and the lack of specific markers.The estimation is based on studies of specific genetic markers found predominantly in the regions conquered by Genghis Khan and his descendants, particularly in Central Asia, Mongolia, and parts of Eastern Europe. It highlights the profound demographic impact of his empire and the prolific nature of his lineage.",
