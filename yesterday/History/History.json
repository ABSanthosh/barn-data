    "title": "The History of the Female Power Suit",
    "link": "http://www.historyisnowmagazine.com/blog/2024/12/14/the-history-of-the-female-power-suit",
    "description": "The female power suit is more than just a fashion statement; it is a symbol of women's evolving role in society and the workforce. From its origins in the early 20th century to its status as an iconic representation of female empowerment today, the power suit has undergone significant transformations, reflecting broader social changes and the ongoing struggle for gender equality. Women’s fashion has long been a source of contention and argument, as it reflects the role of women within the larger society. Dr. Shelby Robert explains. Coco Chanel in 1928.Early Beginnings: The 1920s and 1930sThe concept of women wearing tailored suits dates back to the early 20th century, particularly during the 1920s and 1930s. During this time, women began to enter the workforce in greater numbers, driven by economic necessity and the aftermath of World War I. Designers like Coco Chanel revolutionized women's fashion by introducing more practical and comfortable clothing, including tailored suits. Chanel's designs featured simple lines and a more masculine silhouette, which allowed women greater freedom of movement and a break from traditional, restrictive female attire. The 1940s: War and UtilityThe 1940s, marked by World War II, saw women taking on roles traditionally held by men, including in factories and offices. The need for practical and functional clothing led to the popularization of utility suits. These were often characterized by broad shoulders, nipped-in waists, and knee-length skirts, embodying a mix of femininity and practicality. The suit became a uniform of sorts for working women, signifying their contribution to the war effort and their increasing presence in public life. The 1960s and 1970s: Breaking BoundariesThe 1960s and 1970s were decades of significant social upheaval and change, particularly in terms of gender roles. The feminist movement gained momentum, and women began to challenge traditional norms more vocally. During the 1960s, women began to reject traditional, restrictive clothing in favor of more comfortable and practical attire. The introduction of the miniskirt by designer Mary Quant epitomized this shift, symbolizing freedom and rebellion against conservative norms. Women embraced trousers and jeans, which were previously considered male garments, as a statement of equality and practicality.The 1970s saw the continuation of these trends, with the rise of the women's liberation movement further influencing fashion. Feminists adopted androgynous styles, favoring unisex clothing that blurred gender distinctions. The era also saw the popularity of the \"power suit,\" which allowed women to assert their presence in the professional world. These suits, often characterized by tailored jackets and trousers, became a symbol of women's empowerment and their increasing participation in the workforce. This period's fashion was not just about aesthetics; it was a statement of identity and a tool for challenging and changing societal norms.This era saw the emergence of the power suit, a radical departure from the skirted suits of previous decades. Designers like André Courrèges and Yves Saint Laurent pioneered this look, with Saint Laurent's \"Le Smoking\" tuxedo becoming an iconic piece. The pantsuit was not just a fashion statement but a bold assertion of women's right to dress as they pleased and occupy spaces traditionally dominated by men.  The 1980s: The Power Suit EraThe 1980s is often regarded as the golden age of the power suit. This decade was characterized by a culture of excess and ambition, and the fashion of the time reflected these values. Power suits featured bold, exaggerated shoulders, wide lapels, and tailored lines, often paired with blouses that had equally dramatic details like large bows or ruffles. Designers such as Giorgio Armani and Donna Karan became synonymous with the power suit, which became a staple for women climbing the corporate ladder. The suit symbolized confidence, authority, and a break from traditional gender roles in the workplace. The 1990s and Beyond: Evolving StylesIn the 1990s, the style of power suits began to evolve. The exaggerated features of the 1980s were toned down, giving way to more minimalist and streamlined designs. This decade saw the rise of business casual attire, but the power suit remained a key element of professional wardrobes. Designers like Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren offered suits that were both sophisticated and versatile, suitable for a variety of professional settings. The 21st Century: Diversity and EmpowermentIn the 21st century, the power suit continues to be a symbol of empowerment, but its interpretation has become more diverse. Modern power suits come in a wide range of styles, cuts, and colors, reflecting the individuality and personal style of the wearer. The rise of women in leadership positions across various industries has kept the power suit relevant, and designers continue to innovate with bold patterns, luxurious fabrics, and unconventional silhouettes.The modern power suit is not just confined to the corporate world; it has also found its place in politics, entertainment, and beyond. High-profile figures like Hillary Clinton, Angela Merkel, and celebrities like Lady Gaga and Zendaya have all donned power suits, each bringing their own flair to this iconic garment. Most recently, Vice President Kamala Harris has been pictured frequently wearing a power suit with converse. Her campaign for the presidency of the United States of America is a perfect example of the evolving roles that women are seeking in the modern era. Her modern interpretation of the powersuit is a mark of her mission to embrace female power through the clothing that she CHOOSES to wear.  ConclusionThe history of the female power suit is a testament to the ongoing struggle for gender equality and the changing roles of women in society. From the early 20th century to the present day, the power suit has evolved to reflect broader social changes and the empowerment of women. As women continue to break barriers and assert their presence in all spheres of life, the power suit remains a powerful symbol of strength, confidence, and independence. Find that piece of interest?

    "description": "Charles Darwin’s contribution to science stands virtually without peer.  He was a colossus in the field of evolutionary biology.  He was also a gentleman, a husband, and an invalid.   Lyn Squire, author of Fatally Inferior (Level Best Books 2024 – Amazon US | Amazon UK), the second book in the Dunston Burnett Trilogy, fills in the gaps. Charles Darwin with his eldest son William Darwin, circa 1842.THE WELL-KNOWNEveryone knows that Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution stands as one of the greatest breakthroughs in the history of scientific inquiry.  Darwin was a prolific writer completing more than a dozen major books in his seventy-three-year lifetime, but none as famous, revolutionary, impactful and enduring as On the Origin of Species published on November 24, 1859.Darwin had long known how breeders improved their stock of race horses by the careful mating of their fastest animals.  This process of human selection could be seen in livestock, birds, fruits, vegetables, all designed to develop the most desired traits in each species.  Darwin wanted to know if Mother Nature had a similar mechanism.  The writings of economist Thomas Malthus provided a clue.  He argued that the innate tendency of humans to breed led to populations expanding beyond their means, necessitating a fight for survival.  Darwin had found the springboard for his monumental intellectual leap to the idea of natural selection.  Survival of the fittest!  One general law governing the evolution of all organic beings – multiply; vary; let the strongest live; let the weakest die.  When it finally appeared in 1859, his theory of evolution was underpinned by a vast array of evidence.  Darwin had spent five years aboard HMS Beagle collecting specimens throughout the Galapagos archipelago, and then another twenty-three years compiling observations from around the world and conducting his own experiments before he felt his life’s work was ready for public scrutiny.   As Darwin said in his autobiography, “science consists in grouping facts so that general laws or conclusions may be drawn from them.” THE NOT SO WELL-KNOWNMany of those aware of Darwin’s contribution to our understanding of evolution may know little else about the man.  Other aspects of his life, however, shed light on his research and are of interest in their own right.  The three selected here are: the unsparing criticism of his writings; his marriage; and his chronic illness.CriticismPublication of On the Origin of Species caused an uproar throughout England.  Battle lines were quickly drawn between the new breed of fact-based researchers who readily embraced Darwin’s ground-breaking thesis, and the old guard of religious traditionalists with their unshakeable belief in the Bible’s account of God’s creation of man.  This was science pitted against religion in a life and death battle for the minds and souls of mankind.  Darwin was bombarded with scathing reviews in academic journals, blistering editorials in the leading newspapers and crude cartoons in the cheaper broadsheets.  The Great Debate held in Oxford barely six months after the book’s appearance, illustrates the ugly nature of the clash between firm-in-their-belief theologians and Darwin’s band of truth-seeking scientists.  Both factions behaved in a most unbecoming manner with tasteless taunts and simian slurs from one side answered by childish name-calling and anti-church abuse from the other.  The city of dreaming spires was rocked to the core, buzzing with increasingly far-fetched accounts of the opening salvos in what, from then on, was all-out war.Darwin, though, was a gentleman and a scholar from his time at Christ’s College, Cambridge to his later years at Down House, his home in Kent, and often chose dignified silence over open warfare in press or person.  In this he was fortunate in having Thomas Huxley, a brash but brilliant comparative anatomist, lead the charge in Darwin’s defense.  Huxley even described himself as Darwin’s “bulldog”.  After an offensive question addressed to him by Bishop Wilberforce at the Oxford debate, he famously replied with words to the effect that he, Huxley, would rather be an ape than a bishop.  Even mild-mannered Darwin sometimes expressed his displeasure and disappointment with his academic antagonists.  St. George Mivart, a young biologist, was one such.  He thoroughly savaged Darwin’s Descent of Man in the prestigious Quarterly Review.  Worse still, he ruthlessly criticised an innocuous article on divorce by Darwin’s son.  Darwin was furious.  As it happened, Mivart was seeking membership of the famous Athenaeum Club and Darwin and his supporters, all prominent members, scuttled his election.  A petty response, it might seem, but this was an attack on his family. MarriageDarwin had a long and happy marriage.  He and his wife, Emma, were, however, first cousins.  They had a common grandfather in the person of Josiah Wedgewood.  In the nineteenth century, the offspring of marriages between such close relatives were thought to suffer loss of vigour and even infertility, their frailties then passed on to future generations, the yet-to-be-born progeny already burdened by their inheritance.  Darwin was aware from correspondence with stock breeders throughout England that continued inbreeding of domesticated animals affected the general health and fertility of subsequent generations.  But did the same law of nature apply to humans as was commonly thought?  That was what Darwin desperately wanted to know.  It is little wonder, then, that Darwin devoted so much time and effort to studying the effects of crossbreeding and inbreeding in plants and animals, and even canvassed, albeit unsuccessfully, for the inclusion in the 1871 population census of a question on the number of children born to parents who were first cousins.  Far from being just an intriguing line of scientific inquiry, this was, for Charles Darwin, something frighteningly personal.Sadly, the Darwins lost three of their children – Mary, Anne and little Charles – in infancy.  Death had indeed been an all-too-frequent visitor to the Darwin household, but this was not uncommon for large families in the nineteenth century, and their remaining seven children reached maturity.  Of those, three had offspring, providing the Darwins with ten grandchildren.  Their fears had proven unfounded. IllnessIn youth, Darwin was a vigorous, healthy man.  For the forty years of his adult existence, however, he suffered from bouts of a never-fully-diagnosed, gastro-intestinal illness.  His “accursed stomach” as he called it, caused retching, flatulence, fatigue and vomiting to the point where he was obliged to keep a commode, hidden behind a partition, in his study.  (The visitor to Down House, only an hour and a half’s journey from Central London, can view the scientist’s carefully restored study, including the partition.)Darwin consulted several different doctors and tried every conceivable treatment, some prescribed by respected professionals, others by practitioners little better than quacks.  He tried the water therapy offered at the Water Cure Establishment at Malvern which involved him being heated by a spirit lamp and then rubbed down with cold wet towels while his feet were immersed in a cold foot bath.  Then he moved on to Dr E.W. Lane’s Moor Park hydropathic establishment which was much closer to Down House.  And after that to the Wells House hydropathic establishment in Ilkley, West Yorkshire.  At best, these treatments provided temporary relief, but whether that was a direct result of the therapies or simply the passage of time and natural recuperation is difficult to say.  Either way, his suffering continued.His chronic illness weighed on Darwin, as attested by its frequent mention in his autobiography.  It is a measure of the man, however, that towards the end of his personal account of his life, he was able to remark, perhaps wryly, that: “Even ill-health, though it has annihilated several years of my life, has saved me from the distractions of society and amusement.” Other readingThe above not-so-well-known selections barely skim the surface.  If you wish to learn more about Darwin, an excellent source is the two-volume biography by Janet Browne, Voyaging and The Power of Place, published by Princeton University Press in 1995 and 2002 respectively.  You will find a more personal, fascinating and shorter account of his life in The Autobiography of Charles Darwin, first published by Collins (London) in 1958.    Lyn Squire is the author of Fatally Inferior (Level Best Books, December 2024 - Amazon US | Amazon UK), a story of revenge set against the uproar that greeted publication of On the Origin of Species. Mr. Squire’s first novel in the Dunston Burnett Trilogy, Immortalised to Death (2023), was a First Place Category Winner in the 2023 Chanticleer International Book Awards.  His next book, The Séance of Murder, scheduled for publication in 2025 will complete the trilogy.",
