    "description": "The headgear worn by soldiers during the Civil War presents a fascinating topic. Before the adoption of metal helmets for cranial protection, hats played a significant role in denoting rank, indicating branch of service, and serving as a means of personal expression, as exemplified by the distinctive plume worn by JEB Stuart.Lloyd W Klein explains. Stonewall Jackson in a forage cap.Kepi \u0026 Forage CapThe kepi had been the most common headgear in the French Army. Its predecessor originally appeared during the 1830s, in the course of the initial stages of the occupation of Algeria, as a series of various lightweight cane-framed cloth undress caps called casquette d’Afrique. These were intended as alternatives to the heavier, cloth-covered leather French Army shako. As a light and comfortable headdress, it was adopted by the metropolitan (French mainland) infantry regiments for service and daily wear, with the less practical shako being relegated to parade use.Etymologically, the term is a loanword of French: képi, itself a re-spelled version of the Alemannic German: Käppi, a diminutive form of Kappe, meaning “cap”. Modern-day baseball caps are the direct descendant of kepis.In 1852, a new soft cloth cap was introduced for the campaign and off-duty. Called bonnet de police à visière, this was the first proper model of the kepi. The visor was generally squarish in shape and oversized and was referred to as bec de canard (duck bill). This kepi had no chinstrap (jugulaire). Subsequent designs reduced the size of the cap and introduced chinstraps and buttons.The kepi became well known outside France during the Crimean War and was subsequently adopted in various forms by many other armies (including the U.S. and Russia) during the 1860s and 1870s.The kepi emerged as the quintessential hat associated with Union soldiers, largely due to the superior options available to their Southern counterparts. Characterized by its flat circular crown and a prominent visor, the kepi featured a leather or cloth peak and a chinstrap made of either leather or cord.Among Union forces, a style often referred to as the McClellan cap, was prevalent, with officers frequently embellishing their caps in accordance with French fashion influences. This style had a flat top and squared visor.The forage cap, or bummer cap, called the McDowell cap, had a curved top based on the model 1858 forage cap This shapeless design was particularly favored by the eastern Union army, while troops in the West tended to opt for broad-brimmed felt hats. Some southern troops also wore a forage cap, most notably Stonewall Jackson.Regulations established by the U.S. Army mandated that insignia be affixed to the top of the cap, displaying the branch of service—whether infantry, cavalry, or artillery—at the center, with the company letter positioned above and the regimental number below. In 1863, the Army of the Potomac introduced the corps badge as a means to enhance troop morale, which was subsequently incorporated onto the cap. For infantry soldiers, a bugle horn was placed beneath the disk, featuring the regimental number inscribed within the horn, the company letter situated above it, and the corps badge positioned at the top. However, it was common for soldiers to lack this complete set of insignia, and at times, only the branch of service, company letter, or regimental number insignia was displayed. Additionally, some units opted for colored variations of these insignia.In the Confederate army, a color-coding system was employed to differentiate between various branches of service. The infantry was represented by blue, the cavalry by yellow, and the artillery by red.These were later changed to a thin band with the color of the branch wrapped around the base of the cap to identify the area of service. All uniforms regardless of being Union or Confederate had prominent markings on them which identified whether a soldier was an enlisted man or an officer.  Slouch HatThe slouch hat is one of the most enduring icons of the Confederate soldier, ranking alongside his bedroll, shell jacket and pants cuffs tucked into his socks.  Indeed, the slouch hat came to be the quintessential American military campaign headgear by the end of the Civil War. The Confederate slouch hat was adopted for numerous reasons: it was well-liked, practical and available (when caps were not). Despite the regulation prescribing the French kepi-style cap for wear by all soldiers and officers, many were not able to obtain the cap.  They had to use the common citizen slouch hat. Moreover, the slouch hat was found to be more practical: it was comfortable and provided better protection against the elements.The slouch hat is a wide-brimmed felt or cloth hat often, although not always, with a chinstrap. The name \"slouch hat\" refers to the fact that one side droops down as opposed to the other which is pinned against the side of the crown. The style is highly variable and personal, with various types of crowns and crown heights, brim widths and degrees of softness.This style of hat has been worn for many hundreds of years, especially during the English Civil War during the 17th century when it became associated with the forces of King Charles I, the Cavaliers, but it was also fashionable for the aristocracy throughout Europe.The slouch hat was introduced to this country by a spirited Hungarian patriot named Louis Kossuth. In 1852, Mr. Kossuth completed a speaking tour of our country where he sought and received a great deal of support for Hungarian liberties after his country had become dominated by the Czar of Russia. Louis Kossuth was described by William Cullen Bryant as a man who is “fearless, eloquent, large of heart and of mind, whose one thought is the salvation of oppressed Hungary, unfortunate, but undiscouraged, struck down in the battle of liberty, but great in defeat, and gathering strength for triumphs to come.” From a banquet in honor of Louis Kossuth with the Press of New York, December 9, 1851. Hardee HatThe Hardee hat, also known as the Model 1858 Dress Hat and nicknamed the \"Jeff Davis\", was the regulation dress hat for enlisted men in the Union Army. The Hardee hat was also worn by Confederate soldiers. However, most soldiers found the black felt hat to be too hot and heavy and preferred a forage cap or slouch hat.  The Hardee hat was worn most often by western Union troops, but also by the Iron Brigade, which were popularly known as \"The Black Hats\".The hat was named after William J. Hardee, a career officer in the U.S. Army from 1838 until resigning his commission on January 31, 1861. Hardee was Commandant of Cadets at West Point from 1856 to 1860. Find that piece of interest?

    "link": "http://www.historyisnowmagazine.com/blog/2024/12/20/the-normans-their-history-and-conquests",
    "description": "The Normans were one of the most dynamic forces of the Middle Ages. Famous for the conquest of England and throughout the Mediterranean, these Viking descendants of Northern France proved a dynamic force to be reckoned with from the borders of Scotland to the Holy Land. But while the Normans maintained a deserved reputation for their martial ability, they also proved to be apt administrators and patrons of culture, displaying remarkable willingness for adaptation and integration of local populations. These fascinating warriors would seemingly depart from the world stage as quickly as they arrived laying the foundations of a stable and modern society in their wake. Brian Hughes explains. The Norman Invasion of England, as shown on the Bayeux Tapestry.OriginsDeriving their name from the early French word for “North Men” the Normans as they came to be known were comprised of the Christian descendants of Viking raiders who after generations of marauding were granted a large swathe of territory in the North of France by the French King Charles the II as a means of pacification. This area would come to be known as Terra Normanorum, “The Land of the Northmen” later Normandy. The Vikings would rapidly convert to Christianity and intermarry with the locals gradually eschewing the relics of their forefathers including their language as the Old Norse tongue began to fade away in favor of French. One important vestige of their Viking ancestors in which the Normans would retain would be their sheer martial prowess and their innate thirst for war and conquest. This they would have no issue fulfilling as Northern France proved to be a consistently unstable corner of Europe in which powerful and ambitious feudal Dukes and Lords often challenged the rather tenuous authority of the French Kings in Paris whom they were nominal vassals of. The Normans would regularly clash with their neighbors in Brittany, Maine, and Paris, honing their military capabilities and adopting the latest advances in tactics and technology. These serial conflicts with other French powers would likewise contribute to the Normans shaping their already unique cultural and political identity. Conquest of EnglandIt was not only impressive military capabilities that defined Norman success. The Normans proved enthusiastic in their recent conversions to Christianity currying great favor with the Church in Rome in addition to more local Bishoprics. Establishing such successful rapport with the Church would greatly benefit The Normans who demonstrated themselves to be ample opportunists taking advantage of instability and political fragility throughout Europe to further extend their influence and power. The most famous example of this is “William the Bastard’s” swift and brutal conquest of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of England for which he would earn the eternal epithet “William the Conquer.” William took advantage of a succession crisis following the death of the English King Edward the Confessor.A claimant of the throne of England himself, being a distant relative of the English King, William denounced the recently crowned Harold Godwinson as a usurper and immediately mobilized a coalition of forces including men from Brittany and Flanders. While Harold successfully battled Harold Hardrada, a third contestant to the throne at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in the North of England, William bided his time waiting for the most opportune time to strike knowing Harold’s exhausted and rapidly dissipating army would have to march hundreds of miles south to confront this new threat. In short, William’s impressive tactical and strategic grasp of events would enable the Normans to prevail at the Battle of Hastings in which Harold and the bulk of the Anglo-Saxon nobility would fall thus paving the way for a rapid conquest of the remainder of England. Part and parcel to Norman victories would include their lethal application of cavalry in which Norman Knights sporting Hauberks or large chain mail cloaks charged in tight and cohesive formation with long lances and modern saddles thus enabling them to defeat often more numerous oppositional forces. The Normans would immediately consolidate such victories through rapid castle and fortification construction, mainly of the motte and bailey model which were primarily assembled of earth and timber later to be replaced with more solid stone foundations. These ad hoc forts would be quickly garrisoned and often within close distance to one another thus ensuring quick reinforcement capabilities and in addition to making powerful visual statements to the local populace with their intention of staying. William would follow up his victories with the notorious “Harrying of the North” in which the last remnants of opposition were brutally quelled by fire and sword. Mediterranean and Holy LandThe conquest of England often overshadows other Norman conquests in the Mediterranean and Holy Land. Showcasing their typical aggressive energy, Norman Warlords such as the notorious Robert Guiscard descended on Italy then mostly controlled by the Byzantine Empire. Norman soldiers and adventurers would likewise prove invaluable as mercenaries fighting for squabbling local rulers earning deadly reputations in the process. The largest and likely most prosperous island in the Mediterranean Sicily, would soon find itself under Norman occupation. By 1131, a Norman Nobleman Roger II of Sicily would unite all Southern Italy, Sicily, Malta, and parts of North Africa creating the Kingdom of Sicily in which a multi-cultural mix of Normans, Arabs, Byzantines, and others flourished, developing a unique culture architecturally, religiously, and intellectually in which remnants can still be observed today in cities such as Palermo. The Normans would yet again be at the forefront of one of the most successful expeditionary campaigns in the history of warfare, The First Crusade. With the intention of “liberating” the Holy Land from Islamic control, Christian Princes and Warlords from across Europe but mainly France banded together consolidating their forces to march across the continent and reconquer the sacred sites of the Bible under the banner of Christendom. Given decades of conquest, renowned Normans such as Bohemond of Taranto, an Italo-Norman and Robert Curthose, eldest son of William the Conqueror would be in the vanguard. The First Crusade proved successful beyond anyone’s wildest dreams or calculations. The Crusaders not only captured the Holy City of Jerusalem but also carved up Kingdoms and Duchies from Anatolia to Egypt. Norman resourcefulness and aggression proved to be an effective force multiplier for the outnumbered and meagerly supplied Christian coalition. ConclusionIn many ways the Normans embody the spirit and ethos of the Medieval world. On one hand they were brutal conquerors who ruthlessly slaughtered unprovoked local populations as a means of consolidating their power and rule. However, The Normans at times would also display remarkable tolerance and flexibility over their subjects regardless of ethnicity or religion thus enabling for flourishing societies serving as sort of trendsetters for modern multi-ethnic cosmopolitan societies. Overtime the independent spirit and identity of the Normans would give way to the broader nationalistic identity of the two nations in which they were forever linked to England and France. The Normans may have lost their quasi-independent identity, but to this day the world can be reminded of their short-lived but eternal impact from the Tower of London to Jerusalem.   The site has been offering a wide variety of high-quality, free history content since 2012.

    "description": "In the Xinjiang region of western China, the government has rounded up and detained hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic groups. Many haven't been heard from in years, and more still are desperately searching for their families. Western governments have called this crackdown a cultural genocide and a possible crime against humanity.In this episode, the first of a three-part series from Embedded, NPR correspondent Emily Feng tells the story of one of those people. For years, a Uyghur man named Abdullatif Kucar had no idea what has happened to his wife and young children after they were detained by Chinese authorities. Emilly follows Kucar as he desperately searches for his family.But this story is bigger than one family. In this series, Emily also travels across Asia and dives into decades of history to uncover the massive Chinese surveillance of Uyghurs, getting exclusive interviews with the people suffering from that surveillance and the people upholding it – who sometimes are one and the same.This episode was originally published in 2022.
