    "description": "The Roaring Twenties were a time period filled with tales of adventure and glamour. Prohibition fueled a party lifestyle - and made available a dangerous but adrenaline fueled life to some of the more enterprising members of the underworld. In Chicago, Illinois, the Twenties have become a time of legend and usually call to mind one man, Al Capone. But Capone, for all intents and purposes, was only a figure head during the Beer Wars. He ran his gang and racket, but he delegated the dirty work.To the north of him was a group that was, as one newspaper of the time called them, Modern Day Pirates, The North Side Gang. Consider Capone the Prince John to their Robin Hood and his Merry-men, an analogy that Rose Keefe introduced in her book, Guns and Roses: The Untold Story of Dean O’Banion. Robin Hood isn’t quite as steal from the rich to give to the poor and you’ll need to give Little John a temper and thirst for vengeance that was unrivaled. Also, make the merry-men a little crazier and a lot more deadly. You get the picture. Three years, three bosses dead. The North Side track record was less than desirable, George Moran would have been well aware of this when he took over after the death of Vincent Drucci in April of 1927. He had said goodbye to three of his good friends, the flower shop was gone, Mr. Schofield having kicked them out after Hymie Weiss’s assassination, and having run from the past at least once already in his life, George Moran took stock of his life and probably thought about throwing in the towel. But Chicago was home and he couldn’t just forget everything that had happened. A part of him still wanted revenge and leaving the North Side would have felt like letting his friends down. So Moran did what he did best, he carried on.Erin Finlen continues her series.Part one is here, part two is here, and part three is here.Note: An image of Moran is available here. Minnesota YearsGeorge Moran, the prohibition gangster most associated with being the arch enemy of Al Capone and by extension Chicago was actually from St. Paul, Minnesota and named Adelard Cunin. Born on August 21, 1893 to a French immigrant named Jules and his wife Marie, he was, like his friends enrolled in a Catholic School. And also like his friends, turned to crime at a young age, in fact he had served time three times before he reached the age of twenty one.He and his father did not get along and Adelard regularly was hit with a belt by his dad for his behavior at home. At school, they also believed in corporal punishment and by the time he got home his father could be waiting to punish him again. Strong willed and resilient, the beatings did nothing to change his personality or willfulness. He turned to crime as an outlet for his frustration. At the age of eighteen, he escaped from jail and made his way south to Chicago. His father refused to have anything to do with him, but his mother still kept in touch.It was after arriving in Chicago that Adelard started adopting different names, including George Gage, George Morrisey, George Miller and, of course, George Moran.In photos, Moran typically is wearing something that covers his neck. When he was living in Chicago in 1917, he got in the face of someone heckling a public speaker. A fight broke out and Moran was cut several times on the neck with a knife. He was rushed to the hospital where they managed to stop the bleeding and save his life. He was lucky but also self-conscious of the way the scars looked and would do his best to hid them throughout his life. There was good to come of the incident, though. In his recovery he would meet Dean O’Banion. The Beginnings of the North Side and Rise to LeaderIn 1917, Dean O’Banion was working as a waiter at McGovern’s Tavern, charming customers with his beautiful singing voice. This tavern was where Moran began to become a regular during his recovery. He met there a man named Charles Reiser, who introduced him to bigger kinds of burglary. For the most part, George would steer clear of bootlegging, at least at first, he preferred to stick with thieving and safe cracking.One of Reiser’s safe cracking proteges was O’Banion and the two were drawn to each other, both with independent, stubborn spirits. Although, Moran was much quieter and kept his cards close to his chest. They were joined shortly after by Hymie Weiss and the three became a trio of safecrackers. They were joined by Drucci last and though he was also readily accepted, it was not likely that it was for his thieving skills as his charm and reckless bravery.They were well on their way to becoming the North Side Gang of legend, when Moran was sent to jail again and this time, after an escape attempt that was going well until he got caught, Moran would be absent in Chicago until 1921 as he served his sentence at Joliet Penitentiary.When Moran got out his friends were waiting with good news: they were big shots in the bootlegging business and Moran was happy to help. He even went to Canada to see about a shipment for O’Banion. That wasn’t to say that bootlegging was his only occupation. He was arrested at least once with O’Banion and Weiss for burglary. And at one point Weiss and Moran were both involved in a police chase that ended when the police fired on the car and the pair decided it was safer to pull over.Also, in 1921, Moran met a woman with whom he fell instantly in love, Lucielle Logan. Lucielle was worried that George would run when he found out she had a son, but George was just as smitten with him and adopted him, spoiling him and helping him learn English, as Lucielle and her son, who would go by John George Moran for the rest of his life, spoke French. Surprisingly, he loved being a family man and when one reporter asked him what was next after a funeral, he probably wasn’t lying when he said he just wanted to live with his wife and kid in peace.In 1924, when O’Banion was murdered, Moran was fully on board with Hymie Weiss’s plans to get revenge. There was also another item of business that Moran could not wait to handle. He had never been a fan of O’Banion’s bodyguard, Louie Alterie. So, when Alterie was talking to the media about shooting the murderers of O’Banion and, strangely, following Torrio and Capone to New York after the funeral, Moran sent Alterie packing, saying there was no place for him in the North Side Gang. With that taken care of, it was time to get to the real business of getting even, even if the boss was in jail. While Weiss was in jail in the summer of 1925, Drucci and Moran tried several hits on the Gennas. They weren’t exactly subtle about it though.Between the two of them, neither Moran nor Drucci was known for thinking revenge plans through to the full extent. And with Weiss in jail and the grief over losing O’Banion mixed with a disdain for the Gennas they were more gung ho than usual. Amatuna, who had been a shooter of Dean O’Banion had agreed to hand over to Moran and Drucci the other two men believed to be responsible: John Scalise and Albert Anselmi. They believed Amatuna and went to the rendezvous where they were promptly shot at and both had to be treated at a nearby hospital.After Weiss’s death, Moran agreed with Drucci that peace was the best option but he wasn’t happy about it. And when Drucci died, he kept the peace but he could feel his nagging hatred for Capone, the man who had stolen O’Banion and Weiss from him, itching at him. Then, after Capone battled with other men, he eventually started eyeing a Northwest gang whose territory he wanted. He had the leader bumped off. The man, John Touhy, was an old friend of Moran’s. Seeing another of his friends dead by the hand of Capone reopened the wounds that had never closed from O’Banion and Weiss’s deaths. The war was back. And this time it was going to take a massacre to end it.  CheckmateAfter the death of Touhy, Moran and Capone continued to battle. Murdering continued until Capone had had enough. Somehow word got back to him that Moran was having a meeting at the North Side’s garage on Clark Street. Al Capone was never one to do anything quietly, a fact which irritated his friends back in New York, who found his ostentatiousness to be too attention seeking for their comfort. And what Capone had planned was nothing short of attention grabbing. Unfortunately for him and the seven men who would be in the garage, it wouldn’t see the end of his arch enemy.On February 14, 1929, Moran was late to his meeting at the Clark Street garage. If he was like people of today, running late to your first meeting on a very cold, snowy morning, probably makes you think that your day isn’t going to go well. So, when he turned onto Clark Street and saw black police vehicle sitting outside his garage, he changed his course and went into a nearby diner to wait.Men had been waiting across the street for Moran to enter the garage. When they thought they saw him enter, the signal was given and two men dressed as police officers entered. They had the men surrender their weapons and face a wall with their hands raised. Then they pulled out Thompson submachine guns and opened fire. Six of the men were killed instantly but one was still alive when the real cops arrived, although in his short time left he refused to identify the killers. The carnage was unlike anything Chicago had ever seen and the police and medical examiners were sickened by it. The lone survivor was the mechanic, James Mays, dog, Highball. When the police finally arrived they found him howling and shaking. He was later euthanized due to being unable to recover from what he had witnessed.Word of what happened reached Moran and in a rare show of emotion, he checked himself into a hospital for exhaustion and a stomach issue. When police eventually found him, the only thing he would say was “Only Capone kills like that.” The man who was killed in Moran’s place was Al Weinshank. He looked uncannily like Moran in build and facial features. He was not a criminal, he simply associated with them.Moran didn’t stay long in Chicago after that. And the North Side Gang was no more. Capone had won the Beer Wars. Find that piece of interest? If so, join us for free by clicking here.  Sources:Binder, J. J. (2017).

    "description": "The Peloponnesian War (431–404 BCE) stands as a seminal conflict in ancient Greek history, pitting the maritime power of Athens against the land-based might of Sparta. This article would, therefore, be intended to discuss the complex interplay of ever-changing alliances, along with the strategic motivations and overall balance of power characteristic of this long conflict.Rimmo Loyi Lego explains. The destruction of the Athenian army at Syracuse. By John Steeple Davis. Introduction \u0026 Brief BackgroundThe Peloponnesian War, which took place from 431 to 404 BCE, is in many ways exemplary of the very complex play of alliances, power dynamics, and strategic imperatives characterizing ancient Greece. First, it was a struggle expressing in its roots the very principles of structural realism that govern inter-state relations according to which, in an international system characterized by anarchy, only accumulation of power through forming alliances could reach security. To understand why war was almost an inevitable result, one has to look at the anarchic political landscape of the Greek city-state system. Unlike the centralized empires of Persia or Egypt, Greece was a fragmented collection of independent poleis, each with its own government, military, and strategic interests. There was no overriding authority to moderate disputes or impose order on this Greek world, making it an excellent example of what structural realism would identify as an anarchic international system.Power, in this very decentralized system, became the final guarantor of security, whereas alliances were the mechanisms for survival—not instruments of collective peace. After the Persian Wars (499–449 BCE), two great powers with their respective coalitions began to look towards securing their respective interests. Athens, by its supremacy in naval affairs, transformed the voluntary defensive alliance against Persia into something of an Athenian-controlled empire through the Delian League. This centralization of power, allied with the use of tribute from allied states to fund its expansionist policies, caused resentment among the Greek city-states that had initially joined the league for mutual security.On the other hand, Sparta, as the leader of the Peloponnesian League, led a coalition of land-based, conservative, oligarchic states opposed to Athenian imperial ambitions. Unlike the relatively open democratic society of Athens, Sparta was militarized and deeply invested in the maintenance of internal stability, especially given its dependence on an enslaved population of helots. Athenian interference in the affairs of Peloponnesian League members and its economic sanctions against key Spartan allies like Corinth and Megara fanned the flames of ill-will.The structural realist perspective postulates that since Greece had no central authority, its system worked through the logic of self-help where no state could be completely secure about the intentions of another. This change in the balance of power, because of the rise of Athens, began to spur a security dilemma whereby both Athens and Sparta felt threatened by what each was doing for its own defense. The fear of encirclement by Athenian influence, and the anxiety in Athens over possible Spartan intervention in its empire, fed a cycle of hostilities. By the time war broke out in 431 BCE, diplomatic mechanisms had failed, and neither side was willing to give up strategic ground without risking a loss of prestige and power. The Peloponnesian War, then, was not a struggle of two ideologies—democracy versus oligarchy—but rather an structural necessity, given the logic of an anarchic system where competing hegemons cannot co-exist peacefully. Alliances in the Peloponnesian WarBecause of the Persian Wars, Greek city-states understood the need to develop alliances to safeguard themselves from future attacks. This gave birth to the Delian League and the Peloponnesian League.The Delian League was created in 478 BCE, with an Athenian leadership base and was designed to be a coalition of states to continue fighting against Persia and free the Greek cities which, at that time, were under the Persian rule. Every free city-state trained sails or gave money to aid the league's primary aim of freeing the city-states and retrieving the ships. The league was based on the sacred island of Delos, so every city gave tribute. Gradually, the league shifted in aim when Athens assumed control and the resources aided imperial initiatives. Member states were thus used to enhance Athenian power.The Peloponnesian League, headed by Sparta, was an alliance based on collective defense and the preservation of the order. In contrast with the formally established structures of the Delian League, the Peloponnesian League was less rigid, with Sparta taking political supremacy among its allies. Primarily, this coalition included the city-states from the Peloponnese region seeking to inhibit Athenian dominance and retain autonomy.From a structural realist perspective, these alliances can thereby be viewed as strategic responses to the anarchic international system. Athens and Sparta, as principal actors, sought to enhance their security and project power through these coalitions, thereby attempting to mitigate the uncertainties inherent in a decentralized political landscape. Motivations of Athens and SpartaAlthough both city-states were substantially important in Greece, they were directed by motivations quite opposite to one another founded on the various political systems, economic structure, and attitudes of their citizenry.Athens, being a burgeoning maritime power, wished to expand its influence and protect interests on the economic front. This ambition was exemplified firstly by the formation of the Delian League and then by its evolution into an Athenian Empire. A democratic-style government in the city advanced a culture of dynamic thinking and self-assertiveness that propelled the city toward the idea of empire. Control over critical sea routes and a network of trade was paramount in the suppression of dissent among its subordinate states. The Athenian leadership, under Pericles' authority, visualized Athenian supremacy both culturally and politically. Pericles' Funeral Oration, as presented in Thucydides' writings, praised the values of Athenian democracy, its imperial design, and is a reflection of a city-state quite confident in its destiny.  On the contrary, Sparta held itself back by conservatism, assuming immediate preservation of traditional interests and the preservation of an existing balance of power. The expansion of Athenian influence was perceived by Sparta as a shortcut to threaten Spartan hegemony and thus disrupt its pro-Allied alliance. The anxiety of encirclement and the potential weakening of the entire Peloponnesian League compelled the Spartans to contemplate going to war. Additionally, several speeches made in the Spartan Assembly by Thucydides gave light to incipient worries about the Athenians and how they could act if challenged. In brief, both states realized their choices as a deliberate action under the lens of a structural realist approach. Athens wanted to maximize its own power for the security of its state against economic threats.War as a Balance of Power MechanismThe Peloponnesian War may thus be interpreted, in a general sense, with the balance of power theory—a central tenet of structural realism. The balance of power theory posits that states will act to prevent any one actor from achieving hegemony, thereby maintaining an equilibrium that ensures their survival.The rapid rise of Athens disturbed the previous balance and made it a bipolar system with two hegemonic powers. This change brought about a security dilemma where the defensive actions of one state were perceived as offensive threats by the other. In the eyes of Sparta, the fortifications and naval expansions of Athens were preparations for aggression, while for Athens, the mobilizations of Sparta were signals of an imminent invasion.The proximate cause of the war was a dispute between Corinth and Corcyra, the intervention of Athens on behalf of Corcyra bringing about open hostilities between Athens and Corinth. The follow-up Athenian decree against Megara, better known as the Megarian Decree, acted as further aggrandizement. An ultimatum sent by Sparta to Athens, asking for the abrogation of the decree and the removal of economic sanctions on Megara, was brusquely refused. The failure of said diplomatic efforts finally led to the Spartan declaration of war in 431 BCE, and hence the long conflict started. The war that followed could therefore be an attempt on the part of Sparta and its allies to restore the balance of power by reining in the Athenian expansion and reasserting their own influence within the Greek world. Security Dilemmas and the Escalation of ConflictThe Peloponnesian War is thus a stellar example of what would constitute a security dilemma: a state's actions to increase its own security decrease the security of others, which in turn leads to an escalatory dynamic.To Sparta and her allies, such imperial policies by Athens—which included the enforcement of the Megarian Decree—came to be seen as direct threats to their economic and political interests. Equally, Athens viewed the mobilization of Sparta and her support for dissident elements within the Athenian empire as aggressive moves designed to destroy its authority.This mutual suspicion and the lack of mechanisms to dispel the perceived threats led to an intensification of hostilities. The view from structural realism is that, in the absence of the Leviathan that characterizes the anarchic structure of the international system, there are no means for states but to resort to self-help. One of the important factors for the perpetuation of the war was the security dilemma in which both Athens and Sparta were trapped: neither could show weakness nor could either side give the other any strategic advantages. The Role of Persia: Strategic Interventions and RealpolitikPerhaps one of the most significant, yet sometimes underappreciated or simply not appreciated, aspects of the Peloponnesian War would be the role played by Persia. This war is generally remembered as a struggle among Greeks, but the Persian Empire did actively intervene in its course by choosing specific instances of intervention, giving financial aid to Sparta, and maneuvering diplomatically. In terms of the structural realist view, Persia's policy can be accounted for in that great powers play on the rivalries of emerging powers in a manner that allows them to conserve their influence without engaging in a frontal clash.Thus, during the early years of the War, Persia kept mostly out of it, preferring to watch from the sidelines. But as the war dragged on and both Athens and Sparta began to suffer economic and military attrition, Persia saw its chance to reassert its authority over the Greek world, particularly in Ionia, which had been a contested region since the Persian Wars. The turning point came in the later years of the war when Sparta, realizing it could not hope to compete with Athens in terms of financial resources and naval power, turned to Persia for support.In 412 BCE, Sparta negotiated the Treaty of Miletus with the Persian satrap Tissaphernes whereby Persia would provide financial aid to the Spartan fleet in return for Spartan recognition of Persian control over the Ionian cities—a classic realist strategy whereby states put survival and strategic advantage above ideological or historical scores. Sparta, though having fought on the side of Persia during the earlier Greco-Persian Wars, now joined its erstwhile enemy to conveniently help bring pressure on Athens—such intervention made all the difference.This was possible only through the gold of Persia, which enabled Sparta to build a formidable navy and thereby ultimately conquer Athens at the Battle of Aegospotami in 405 BCE, in which the entire Athenian fleet was annihilated. This last blow led to the siege and surrender of Athens in 404 BCE. The ability of an exogenous actor, Persia, to manipulate and influence the war between the Greek city-states lends weight to the structural realist notion that weak states—here, Athens and Sparta relative to Persia—are always at the mercy of a stronger power's strategic calculations. Persia played Athens and Sparta rather perfectly against each other, making sure that none of them ever rose as an unrivaled hegemon in the Greek world. Conclusion: A Structural Realist Interpretation of the Peloponnesian WarThe Peloponnesian War was the inevitable consequence of the rise of Athens to pre-eminence that fundamentally disrupted the existing balance of the Greek world. According to structural realism—especially the variant offered by Kenneth Waltz and John Mearsheimer—the anarchic character of the international system compels states to seek power for survival, which entails conflict when a rising power challenges the dominance of an established hegemon. Sparta, the paramount land power, saw Athenian expansion as an existential threat to its very survival; it found itself in a security dilemma with the other great power, each escalating its military preparedness and making war all but inevitable. The war was not a matter of ideology but a structural necessity to restore equilibrium in the Greek world, proving the realist assertion that power struggles, rather than moral or ideological factors, dictate international relations. Find that piece of interest?
