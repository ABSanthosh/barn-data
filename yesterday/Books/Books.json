    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/marc-fasteau/industrial-policy-for-the-united-states/",
    "description": "Investment banker Fasteau and economist Fletcher, both members of the Coalition for a Prosperous America, present a wide-ranging critique of the economic orthodoxy that holds unfettered free trade as alwaysa blessing. In reality, they argue, America’s pro-free trade policies have led to the offshoring of crucial industries, including the production of military equipment and medical supplies that are critical to national well-being, and the replacement of stable, well-paying manufacturing jobs with low-wage service and retail jobs. They call for a comprehensive, protectionist industrial policy that would nurture “advantageous industries” that underlie an innovative, high-tech, high-wage economy, and for a monetary policy that would end the overvaluation of the dollar that produces trade deficits by making American products artificially more expensive than those of foreign competitors. The authors flesh out these ideas in intricate case studies of industrial policies around the world; they discuss China’s ruthlessly effective program of boosting exports through unfair trade practices as well as the evolution of various American industries, like the decades-long saga of the Big Three automakers’ loss of market share. They conclude with detailed policy proposals, which include leaving the World Trade Organization, raising tariffs on imports, and providing manufacturing companies with a raft of government loans and tax breaks. Fasteau and Fletcher synthesize a wealth of data and economic history into an incisive analysis of the workings and pitfalls of free trade. They convey all of this in lucid, accessible prose that manages to turn complex technical arguments into pithy, down-to-earth aphorisms. (“Growth is about turning Burkina Faso into South Korea, not about being the most efficient possible Burkina Faso forever,” they write in a tour-de-force debunking of the theory of comparative advantage.) The result is a lucid diagnosis of America’s economic decline and an ambitious, hopeful program for reversing it.",

    "description": "Fifteen months after cult leader Patrick Nye ended his group’s hostage-taking at a theatrical gala by detonating bombs that killed 43 people, the case is ready to go to trial—with one hitch. John Horner, a senior advocate to the Crown Prosecution Service, needs someone to comb through the material that’s been excluded from the mountain of evidence to be presented in court to make sure that none of it is relevant, potentially complicating or weakening the case and risking its dismissal. The task falls to Eve Wren, who’s been working for the CPS since getting canned from a Shropshire law firm when the senior colleague she blew the whistle on blamed her for his mistakes. So, this time, Eve has every motive to be extra careful. If only that were equally true of DCS Seth Strutton, the senior investigating officer, and DS Gary Lees, the officer in charge. In the absence of their firm support, Eve soldiers on, sifting through box after box of potential evidence, unaware that a series of flashbacks to the fatal event are providing more and more information that would be incredibly useful to her. At length she discovers a burner phone that can’t be accounted for by any tallies of the phones used by the group or their victims, and the messages on that phone, which originally sound pretty bland, turn out to be damning. It’s right around then that Eve’s troubles begin to intensify to a boiling point.",
