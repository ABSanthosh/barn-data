    "description": "Rising senior Ethan Granger lives a comfortable life in a gated community in Ottawa. He has a fickle girlfriend, Nora, whom he considers worth the heartache. The fact that his father is a self-described “smooth talker”—or, Ethan admits to himself, a liar—is brought home again when he sees his dad with some men in a strip mall parking lot in town at the same time that he’s supposedly just leaving the airport. After attempting to dig into his father’s business dealings on his own, Ethan hires private investigator Imani Abboud. But when she advises him that something illegal is going on and he should avoid danger by ceasing to look further, Ethan decides to continue on his own. Enlisting best friend Owen, old schoolmate Aki, and Nora (between breakups), Ethan stakes out an address he got from the PI. Eventually Jean-Guy, Aki’s boyfriend, helps with surveillance, too. An epilogue shares the impact on Ethan’s family of his completed investigation. His first-person narration will ensnare readers immediately, sustaining their interest as this compact, strongly paced story navigates red herrings and subplots. Aki and PI Abboud are well rounded in their secondary roles. Main characters read white; names cue ethnic diversity in the supporting cast.",

    "description": "Magda Batey, the implant physician at a Pittsburgh fertility clinic, directs the lead embryologist, 36-year-old Emily Daugherty, to meet with and gracefully reject two potential clients; they’re risky prospects that could bring down Batey’s success numbers. Emily is surprised when the couple in question turns out to be her former college boyfriend, Ben Holiday (“The only man I’d ever thought of having a child with, and I just let him go.”), and his wife, Ally. Emily can’t bring herself to disappoint the pair, who’ve suffered four miscarriages, so they advance in the clinic’s IVF process, where, according to Emily, “The real conjuring of life occurs behind closed doors, in a highly regulated laboratory led by me.” Reinard then begins interspersing chapters from Ally’s perspective; she’s a marketing analyst who’s annoyed by Ben’s job switch, which moved them fromShelby, North Carolina, to Pittsburgh, and she’s harboring secrets. The women’s fates become intertwined, as Emily also undergoes IVF at the same time. Overall, Reinard crafts an enjoyable, twisty suspense novel that calls to mind Paula Hawkins’ 2015 bestseller The Girl on the Train. As the story goes on, the author nicely develops her two main female characters with nuanced complexity; readers may not find either to be completely likable, but they always remain compelling. Reinard also effectively depicts Emily’s chilling egotism and questionable ethics, as conveyed in flashbacks and particularly in the clinic, where she sees the embryos as “my babies” before they’re anyone else’s.",
