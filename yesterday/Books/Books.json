    "description": "At one point, the speaker offers readers a quick framework for his musings, saying that this “story is a memoir in the form of a novel pretending to be a memoir.” After a life spent in Manhattan, where he faced the deaths of many friends from complications from AIDS, the gay storyteller and wanderer moves to a smaller college town and begins to work at an architecture firm. Conversationally, he reveals details of his personal relationships, both in the city and in his new space. Some involve the tragedies of friends, while others limn narcissistic lovers and companions. Readers catch glimpses of his past aspirations to be a writer. Set during an era of epidemic, the novel effectively describes how a missed phone call from a friend could be a missed chance to say goodbye. In lighter moments, though, it describes a narrator who can’t help telling stories but also expresses frustration about how he spends little time writing. As readers hear tales of friends gone too soon and failed attempts at love with cheaters or people soon to die, they effectively catch glimpses of how they shape the narrator’s outlook and sense of self. The book is filled with compelling characters and its well-paced storyline gives the impression that the novel is just a start; there could easily be another engaging 200 pages about what happens next. The revelations are hopeful, as when the narrator discovers his role in finding love: “My expectations changed when I realized I was not as honest and truthful and trusting as I wanted another man to be.” Overall, it’s a relatable work that gives a voice to a period of suffering.",

    "description": "From author and comedian Raskin comes a sincere examination of the laws, history, and social norms surrounding Western society’s expectations for a successful relationship and marriage. Drawing on personal experience as well as interviews and first-person stories from American couples, she explores the cultural effects of marriage and how modern-day relationships continually change and evolve. Beginning by questioning what the actual definition of marriage is and why so many unions are often dissolved, she invites readers to explore the complexities of marriage in society today. “I think our changing world is developing a new relationship toward it. People considering marriage are confronting different variables…and it’s left them with a lot of uncertainty and differing opinions than past generations.” Weaving research and statistics with viewpoints shaped by her experiences with OCD and anxiety, Raskin challenges her audience to ask questions and to explore the “why” when deciding what modern-day marriage means to each person. Ten chapters explore the different variables to consider when determining whether marriage is right for someone, including sex, cultural norms, financial issues, couples therapy, religion, and divorce. Ending on a compassionate note, Raskin urges readers to define marriage for themselves and their individual needs. “I think the true value of modern marriage is getting to build your own definition of what it actually means to be married,” she writes. “In Western society at least, marriage has shifted from a requirement to a choice. And not just the choice of whether to get married, but the choice of what kind of marriage to build together.”",
