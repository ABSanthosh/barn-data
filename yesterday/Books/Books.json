    "title": "REIKI IN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/m-lori-torok/reiki-in-integrative-medicine/",
    "description": "The author, an integrative healthcare practitioner, takes readers on a journey through the ins and outs of reiki, framing it as a method of healing and rejuvenation—and not, she clarifies, as a kind of religious belief. Reiki, a Japanese term meaning “universal life energy,” is a “non-invasive relaxation technique,” the author says, intended to help the body, mind, and spirit align in a state of peak health. Although users of reiki often do so on a regular basis, there’s no limit to how frequently it can be practiced, the author says. Much of what Torok discusses are the practicalities of the reiki experience, such as the various options available during a session—during which the subject may either be lying down or seated, for example—and the physical sensations that one may expect, such as temperature changes, tingling, and so on. She also delves into how to find a legitimate practitioner, as reiki is not federally licensed in the United States, and she suggests questions to ask before booking a session. The author’s information comes from various sources, including cited scientific studies, books, anecdotes about clients, and Torok’s personal experiences. Readers who are already familiar with reiki are not likely to find anything new or particularly helpful in this guide, but for beginners, it offers a trove of information. Starting with thorough explanations of what reiki is, it logically segues into the hows and whys of an often misunderstood practice. Its subject matter covers the basics in largely straightforward terms, although some passages feel less well defined, as when the author notes that reiki practitioners work with the “metaphysical experience of vibrational frequency and the healing potential of unconditional love.” Still, Torok’s warm tone and straightforward delivery ultimately make for an engaging read for anyone who’s considered reiki therapy.",

    "title": "A BEAUTIFUL HOMECOMING",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/layinka-sanni/a-beautiful-homecoming/",
    "description": "The author invites readers on a “journey of self-recovery where [they’ll] know with every molecule within [them] that [they] are worthy.” Sánní discusses her training in practices like Neuro-Linguistic Programming and her experience working as a personal coach for women. She also details her firsthand experience with challenges like finding oneself in a “self-imposed prison of negativity.” In this work, the author encourages her audience to discover new conceptions of themselves. Readers are advised to examine what types of thoughts they give their time to and to take a look at their pasts through the perspective of an inner child. The journey is not always easy; to embrace one’s inner child, one must “come face to face with her and really see her.” Chapters end with actionable steps, like journaling from question prompts such as, “What are ten things that you love about yourself?” Sánní writes from a faith-based, Islamic perspective—there are occasional quotations from the Qur’an, such as a verse about repentance that acts to remind readers that “past mistakes don’t define us if we choose for them not to.” The text progresses in a friendly, conversational style (the author often addresses the reader directly as “my lovely”). Sánní emphasizes that “you, and only you, have control of your thoughts and feelings; and only you have control over whether you’ll allow your past to define your future.” Self-help readers will have likely encountered some of the book’s advice before; concepts like journaling and learning to say no (even if “saying ‘no’ is a new realm for you”) are standard fare for the genre. Still, the welcoming tone for specifically Muslim women helps to set the book aside from similar works. Ultimately, the author’s warmth shines through as she wholeheartedly guides her readers to new versions of themselves.",
