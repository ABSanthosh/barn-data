    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/maryann-clarke/secrets-at-the-aviary-inn/",
    "description": "Sophie Groenveld has finished her undergraduate studies in Toronto. She and her boyfriend, Marc-Antoine, are in York, England, a stop on their grand European tour. Sophie is here against her parents’ wishes, but she is on a mission. The only thing she knows about her mother’s background is that she was born and raised in York; she is determined to learn her mother’s full history. After an argument at a local pub, Marc-Antoine deserts Sophie, mistakenly taking her backpack with him instead of his own. Now, she is without money, passport, and rail pass. Desperate for funds, she scores a job as the night-desk clerk at The Aviary Inn, owned and managed by the enigmatic Mrs. Ava Roxtoby, who is at times efficient and alert and at other times appears to wander in a daze. Sophie detects an underlying sadness in the woman and feels an urge to connect. (She explains early on that she is “drawn to people, curious about them, and involved in their stories.”) Gradually, Sophie also begins to suspect that her mother has a connection to this Inn, with its quirky collection of stuffed birds and its assortment of live feathered friends in its unique private aviary. Clarke’s coming-of-age novel tracks Sophie’s summer-long interactions with a cohort of Inn employees; an elderly, mercurial Inn resident; and a growing circle of friends (including a couple of potential romantic partners) as she hunts down clues to her mother’s origins and tackles her own troubles. The story is slow-paced, but the prose, peppered with a variety of local accents, terminology, and customs, is engaging, and there are enough twists and turns to maintain readers’ interest. As secrets unravel, there are only a few surprises, but the plotline is addictive and Sophie is a sturdy, likeable protagonist.",

    "title": "THE SKY WILL OVERTAKE YOU",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/marcia-falk/the-sky-will-overtake-you/",
    "description": "Falk explores themes of transience, memory, and grief in this book of poems rooted in nature. In the opening entry, the speaker’s muse informs her that she is unnecessary because the sky is a “stunning event” whose ever-changing inspiration is more powerful than imagination. In “It,” the poet describes a fleeting but blissful moment of nothingness, “the mind gently sweeping thought away / until the window is blank” before life’s noise rushes in again. As “Morning” dawns, the speaker admires the sunrise, determined to love her life despite regrets. In “Geranium,” she contemplates the flower’s “hot eye, / which glares back at you like fire.” A “Summer Storm” batters a garden, and the speaker wonders why some blooms survived while the peonies succumbed to the downpour. A bird careening into a window serves as an “Awakening.” Memories of childhood difficulties creep into some of the poems: “The Walls of My House” recalls tension between a girl and her mother, juxtaposed with a neighbor in a coma whose daughter waits at her bedside for “a half-spoken word, / any blessing or curse.” “What Kept Me Standing” recounts a father hitting his 13-year-old daughter so hard she bleeds all over her hot-pink sneakers. “Enduring” reassures readers that sorrow “will retreat” and that time “wrestles down grief,” allowing one to “re-emerge, whole and cleansed.” The final poem, “Open Gate,” invites readers “to begin again.” Falk plumbs the depths of emotional and ecological truths with these sparse but insightful verses. The poet captures the holiness of nature, from “falling petal, wind-lifted leaf, / shift of shadow on grass” to the healing, grounding powers of a “lush, chaotic” garden. Her words paint stunning portraits as she describes “The laden arms of the oak, the elm, / and the agitated hunger of the small jays, // the fat globes of white sugarmum / where bees suck love.” However, the poems may be too abstract and removed for readers who prefer a more direct approach.",
