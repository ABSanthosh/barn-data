    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jennifer-j-brown/when-the-baby-is-not-ok-hopes-and-genes/",
    "description": "As is true for any new parent, Brown’s life changed immensely with the birth of her first child, Lily.She initially found it hard to maintain routines that had once been easy, but the adjustment period seemed to be going as expected. Then she received an unexpected call from her doctor, reporting that her baby had tested positive for the genetic disorder phenylketonuria, which prevents the breakdown of a particular amino acid, which, in turn, results in developmental disabilities and seizures. It’s a disorder that usually appears in one in 10,000 births in the United States, and according to the author’s calculations, the likelihood of a geneticist, like her, having a baby with this rare genetic disorder is about one in 100 million. In the wake of this revelation, Brown reflected on her life leading up to that moment, processing her complex feelings on reproductive procedures, as well as grief, acceptance, sadness, and joy. This work balances a compelling mix of personal experience, emotional exploration, and scientific knowledge. Although the book initially follows the thread of Brown’s memories, it’s effectively expanded by her research. For example, her discussions of fertility and pregnancy are initially introduced due to their connection to the author’s personal experience, but the multifaceted sections grow until they’re informative essays, revealing, in great depth, the broader implications of these topics and how they touch the lives of many others. Amid specific, practical discussions of caring for children with PKU, for example, she tells stories of many others, including famous names such as Nobel Prize–winner Pearl S. Buck and entertainer Dale Evans, who were also mothers of children with genetic disorders. Frequently, the book refreshingly reminds readers how all lives are intertwined.",

    "title": "LUSTFUL APPETITES",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/rachel-hope-cleves/lustful-appetites/",
    "description": "“Good food held little importance at the tables of my childhood,” writes historian Cleves, who has since overcome those overlooked meal presentations to produce a rousing study of gastronomy and carnal appetite. The author has spent a decade making impressive use of historical archival information, scientific research experiments, blogs, films, books, ancient Chinese poetry, and modern multimedia to present a lush and fascinating chronicle of cuisine. Her text incorporates key discussions involving the Puritan hypothesis linking alimentary appetites with gluttony and illicit sexual behavior, the emerging restaurant industry in late-18th-century France (locales that were often favored by sex workers and adulterers), and how a preference for food became identity markers for bohemian and queer cultures and sexual outlaws of the late 19th and 20th centuries. She traces the interwoven legacy of the first French restaurant, its “sexual disreputability” upon arriving on U.S. shores, its association with sex work, the advent of the waitress, and the sexual aphrodisiac symbolism of “archetypal seduction food” like oysters, crawfish, partridges, eggs, tomatoes, beets, chocolate, and, naturally, strawberries. Cleves highlights reproving Puritan ministers and leaders, such as Seventh-Day Adventist Church founder and prophet Ellen White, who developed cautionary theories in the late 1800s about the correlation between “bad eating” and “sexual sin.” In that same era and beyond, bohemian culture emerged alongside a landslide of queer communities exhibiting a “passion for the table” and for gourmet cooking. Having spent time immersed in European culture, Cleves cleverly integrates a discussion on international epicureanism into the book’s second half, which celebrates the arrival of the “foodie” in the late 1900s, detaching the term from its former association with sexual immorality, and on how the term “food porn” became synonymous with eating with both the eyes and the mouth. While Cleves sadly attests that some of the stigmas surrounding cuisine and intimacy remain intact, food will always be, for many, an “instrument of seduction.”",
