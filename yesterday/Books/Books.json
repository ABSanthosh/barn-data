    "description": "Two big-eared rodents—Pépin, who wears a blue bow tie, and Cosette, who sports a pink flower—accompany Grand-mère to the museum, where they gaze at Hawkins’ cartoonish interpretations (or MousterWorks) of well-known paintings by Edward Bannister, Johannes Vermeer, Claude Monet, and others. The enthralled Cosette eagerly engages with the art, imagining the scents and sounds the subjects might be experiencing, while Pépin’s more concerned with tracking down cheese. While readers will enjoy picking out the adorable rodents interspersed throughout the MousterWorks—a mouse is tucked into bed alongside the youngster in Rosa Bonheur’s Child and Cat, for instance—they won’t get that much out of the paintings themselves. The brief, plotless text provides no historical context or discussion of the pieces; readers curious about the performance depicted in Miyagawa Choshun’s Ryukyuan Dancers and Musicians, for instance, will need to go elsewhere to learn more. And though the MousterWorks are cute enough, alterations in composition, facial expressions, and color scheme mean that readers won’t get the full emotional effect. An author’s note includes a link to a website comparing the MousterWorks to the originals, while endpapers list the names and birth and death dates of the artists.",

    "description": "“At home, my confidence shows, / at home, my bravery glows.” But when the young narrator is out and about, everything changes. Interacting with other kids at the park is “a big task.” “I try to play, I try to shout, / but my brave voice just won’t come out!” Though the protagonist looks forward to school, upon arrival, “fear replaces my words, and my legs start to shake.” When the teacher asks a question, the child’s “glow” is nearly extinguished. But the narrator is comforted by Mum and Dad’s repeated reassurance: “It’s OK to feel upset, / my brave muscles haven’t grown fully just yet.” As the narrator practices “brave talking” at the park, a restaurant, and more with the help of a special present, those muscles gradually strengthen: “My glow stays bright even though my voice is still small, / each time I am brave, / I feel 10 feet tall!” Reinforcing the emotionally descriptive rhyming text, Baykovska’s expressive cartoon illustrations sympathetically convey the contrast between the talkative exuberance the narrator displays at home and the sadness and anxiety experienced in public. The narrator and the rest of the family have tan skin; background characters are racially diverse. Backmatter includes tips and resources on selective mutism for caregivers.",
