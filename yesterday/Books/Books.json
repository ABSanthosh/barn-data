    "description": "Princess Kiar is already worried about the kingdom of Valenia’s upcoming winter as wildlife eats or tramples the realm’s crops. She’s further unnerved when her grandmother forwards a vague warning (“the past has come back”). This may be a reference to the kingdom’s bog, which is seemingly getting bigger and overtaking the pasture. Kiar feels a presence out in that bog, as if something is watching her and her loved ones, including her foster brother and romantic interest Tuan. Indeed, locals describe raiders resembling walking trees with an eerie “stiff-jointed” style of mobility invading their farmsteads, apparently after the livestock. These monstrous “bog-walkers” are difficult to take down, which Kiar and her family quickly learn during a confrontation that leaves King Tir seriously injured. Valenians aren’t the only ones under threat of the expanding bog; someone from northern enemy territory of Noermark asks for Kiar’s help. The princess desperately searches for background about the bog-walkers—where they’re from and why they seem particularly afraid of her. Nods to the first installment in the series, The Swan Harp (2024), are clearly and concisely woven into Kiar’s first-person narration, though a few relatively minor characters pop up with no reminders of their pre-existing relationships. Kiar and her family are a well-rounded bunch, most of them “swanfolk” with an ability to shift between swan and human forms. They find themselves in exhilarating battle scenes that require combat skills and shrewdness as well as magic. The bog-walkers are exceedingly creepy, even after the story illuminates their mysterious origin. A rousing first half is followed by a somewhat less-exciting second half and a noticeably prolonged final act. Nonetheless, the closing pages offer surprises and plenty of reasons to stick around for the upcoming finale.",

    "description": "Joan Baez Smith, nicknamed “Baezy” (“rhymes with daisy”), is very excited about her upcoming birthday present. Her physicist mother has used her connections to allow her to pass through a Time Insertion Protocol portal to go back to Bethel, New York, in 1969 to see the famed Woodstock Music and Art Fair. Not only will Baezy get to see Joan Baez perform, but she’ll also get to meet her distant relative, Kelly Jean Adams, whose mathematical genius set the world on the path to the future utopia in which Baezy lives. In a flash, Baezy travels from December 13, 2101, to August 15th, 1969, falling right into the path of Jack Warren, the best friend of Baezy’s great-great-great-grandmother. She meets Kelly’s traveling group and introduces herself as Sarah Sandoval, an alias that the Time Insertion Protocol employees found for her. As Sarah, Baezy gets to enjoy the music of Woodstock, the food of the time period, and the kindness of strangers brought together by the one-of-a-kind event. However, she didn’t expect that she wouldn’t get along with her ancestor, and that she’d find herself falling in love with Jack. In this offbeat time-travel novel, readers and music lovers alike will delight in the Woodstock-set scenes, as well as all the references to famous musicians who played there, including Baezy’s namesake: “Sarah jumped to her feet when Joan began belting the chorus, her voice washing over the crowd clear and strong.” Overall, this book is both a nostalgic and occasionally critical ode to the 1969 music scene and an SF novel about a futuristic society altering the flow of the past, and it manages to weave the two elements together in an entertaining way. The specific focus on the Woodstock music festival gives this novel a unique spin that genre aficionados are likely to enjoy.",
