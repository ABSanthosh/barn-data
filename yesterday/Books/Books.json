    "description": "Magda Batey, the implant physician at a Pittsburgh fertility clinic, directs the lead embryologist, 36-year-old Emily Daugherty, to meet with and gracefully reject two potential clients; they’re risky prospects that could bring down Batey’s success numbers. Emily is surprised when the couple in question turns out to be her former college boyfriend, Ben Holiday (“The only man I’d ever thought of having a child with, and I just let him go.”), and his wife, Ally. Emily can’t bring herself to disappoint the pair, who’ve suffered four miscarriages, so they advance in the clinic’s IVF process, where, according to Emily, “The real conjuring of life occurs behind closed doors, in a highly regulated laboratory led by me.” Reinard then begins interspersing chapters from Ally’s perspective; she’s a marketing analyst who’s annoyed by Ben’s job switch, which moved them fromShelby, North Carolina, to Pittsburgh, and she’s harboring secrets. The women’s fates become intertwined, as Emily also undergoes IVF at the same time. Overall, Reinard crafts an enjoyable, twisty suspense novel that calls to mind Paula Hawkins’ 2015 bestseller The Girl on the Train. As the story goes on, the author nicely develops her two main female characters with nuanced complexity; readers may not find either to be completely likable, but they always remain compelling. Reinard also effectively depicts Emily’s chilling egotism and questionable ethics, as conveyed in flashbacks and particularly in the clinic, where she sees the embryos as “my babies” before they’re anyone else’s.",

    "description": "In 1920, Leonarda Bucci gives birth to her first son, Emilio, in Agrigento, Italy. Her husband Salvatore, tormented by his nightmarish World War I experiences fighting in the Piave, struggles to overcome the baby’s resemblance to his abusive uncle Aldo. The Bucci family is sustained by Salvatore’s employment on the estate of wealthy olive oil merchant Giovanni Savoia and his wife Maria. The two families become closely connected by the friendships between Leonarda and Maria Savoia and their respective children, Emilio and Floria, who are born at the same time. Italy’s economic and political turmoil motivates Maria, Floria, and the Bucci family (which now includes a second son, Raffaele) to emigrate to Canada by 1933. Adjusting to Canada proves difficult—the immigrants face anti-Italian prejudice in school and in everyday life, exacerbated by World War II. After Raffaele loses his temper in a local diner, Salvatore, Emilio, and Raffaele are arrested under the War Measures Act and sent to a hellish camp called Petawawa. Salvatore tells Emilio, “When I was a soldier, I let them kill parts of me I wish I hadn’t…But you and only you have the power to let them die. They may lead you to believe that they have that power, but that is wrong. Only you do.” These words sustain Emilio through his time in Petawawa and a number of tragic losses. Scibetta’s compelling work of historical fiction explores themes of family dynamics, prejudice, and love with a narrative that vividly illustrates the hatred and discrimination that Italian immigrants to Canada faced during the 1930s and throughout World War II. In the current climate of demonization of immigrants, this work provides a unique and welcome historical perspective on displacement.",
