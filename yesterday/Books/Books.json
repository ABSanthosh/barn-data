    "title": "THE LIFE OF HEROD THE GREAT",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/zora-neale-hurston/the-life-of-herod-the-great/",
    "description": "Following on Moses, Man of the Mountain (1939), Hurston spent years studying the life of Herod the Great, the famed Jewish leader. Her editor rejected the resulting book, which wound up in a trunk and then, following her death, in flames—the trunk burned by a crew hired to clear out her house—and miraculously rescued by a passing sheriff’s deputy who knew she was a writer. Hurston had two apparent purposes: She wished to chronicle “the 3,000 years struggle of the Jewish people for democracy and the rights of man,” and she saw in Herod’s alliance with Rome a metaphor for the Cold War struggle between Russia and the United States. While many ancient sources portray Herod as a tyrant, anticipating the fiercer denunciation of his son as the scourge of both Jesus Christ and John the Baptist, Hurston builds on other accounts; in particular, she rejects the charge that a monstrous Herod ordered “the massacre of the innocents,” instead insisting that “he was beloved by the nation.” The Herod of her story is a smolderingly handsome man suitable for a romance novel, which earns him the attention of a lustful and decidedly bad Mariamne, who repaid his blandishments by plotting his death, bringing it instead on herself: “Mariamne was dead. Dead. Never to burn away annoyances with her hot, soft body.” Hurston sometimes writes with a kind of high-gothic-romance seriousness (“My own father is at fault for beseeching Caesar to reinstate this treacherous Hyrcanus in the priesthood”), mixing in charming if perhaps not quite appropriate Southernisms (“Cleopatra knew more ways to kill a cat besides choking it to death on butter”). Altogether, the manuscript, while an interesting historical document, lacks the polish of Hurston’s classic books, such as Dust Tracks on a Road and Their Eyes Were Watching God.",

    "title": "THURSDAY FIRE",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/benjamin-t-rogers/thursday-fire/",
    "description": "In these pages, anecdotes from the author’s life, career, and participation in sports exemplify his teachings, which extol the virtues of integrity, timeliness, humility, discipline, a positive attitude, and continual improvement (Rogers focuses on Thursdays because he emailed his first motivational message to coaching clients on that day in 2019). The author cites his father and his high school football coach as his greatest mentors, but he also highlights other people as examples of excellence, like his popular barber—Rogers notes his barber’s success isn’t due to his haircutting savvy but to his personality. The author also praises various businesses, like the Markel Group, a company that emphasizes honesty, fairness, and even humor in their work style. Among Rogers’ original concepts is “Treadmill Accountability,” which takes the idea that treadmills don’t lie and uses it as a metaphor for brutal honesty with oneself in the personal and professional spheres. The aphorism “God gave us two ears and one mouth for a reason” inspires the author’s command to “Respect the Ratio,” meaning leaders should listen more than they talk. Rogers cautions against “The Waiting Place,” a state characterized by hesitation and procrastination in which progress dies. He concludes with a reminder that there’s “no finish line” to self-improvement. (As an extra motivational push, Rogers signs off each message with “Average sits on the bench.”) The book’s short chapters and weekly reading structure will make it easy for leaders to stay inspired. Rogers also infuses his advice with humor: One of his team’s “three simple rules” is “Do not be f****** late.” The author unabashedly encourages black-and-white thinking, and some observations (“We all know the professionals execute the boring while the amateurs lie to themselves”) lack nuance. The sports metaphors may seem excessive and unrelatable to those uninterested in professional athletics.",
