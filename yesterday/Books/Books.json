    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/erik-martin/the-case-of-the-greensboro-gremlins/",
    "description": "Twelve-year-old Dotty Morgan is a seasoned supernatural sleuth in Elderton, North Carolina. In this third installment of her eponymous series, local boy Jimmy Grubbler pleads for her to protect his gremlin friends from a human aggressor. Dotty instead joins her girlfriend Hannah Matson and best friend, Parker Pose, in Greensboro for the former’s wrestling tournament and the latter’s fashion competition. While there, the friends realize that Jimmy may not be the only one with a gremlin problem: Weird accidents keep happening at Greensboro Fashion Week, and it’s up to Dotty to stop them from ruining her friend’s big moment. (“Reality exists independent of belief. If something is going on, I’ll find out.”) With Hannah’s irresponsible mother and her shady boyfriend in the mix, alongside suspects like famous designer Chadwell Pose’s assistant and contest coordinator Bunny Fingerhut, Dotty has her work cut out for her. Could gremlins really be the cause of the incidents at the fashion show? And could some sinister human be pulling the strings behind the scenes? This follow-up to The Case of the Zombie Ninjas (2024) presents a slightly more grown-up Dotty struggling with puberty, Hannah’s mother’s drug addiction, and homophobia alongside her usual paranormal opponents. These issues are neatly woven into the narrative, emerging organically without overwhelming the action. Martin makes a special effort to point out each character’s race, not just those of Dotty (who is Black) or her friends, which illustrates the author’s commitment to inclusion and representation. While the classic whodunit plot only occupies the middle third of the novel, and thus may leave hardcore mystery lovers wanting more, other readers will appreciate this deeper dive in Dotty’s daily life.",

    "title": "THE SIEGE OF TYRE",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-guenther/the-siege-of-tyre/",
    "description": "In an absorbing, meticulously researched study, Guenther hones in on Alexander’s 332 BC siege of what was once a Phoenician island—now attached to the coast of Lebanon. In hot pursuit of the Persian emperor, Darius, Alexander made the strategic move to disband the Macedonian-Greek navy, as it was no match for the powerful Persian navy, and instead concentrate on striking by land the string of Phoenician coastal towns that made, supplied, and repaired the great Persian ships. After enduring a long march into Asia Minor, then clashing with and scattering Persian troops in the battles of Granicus and Issus, Alexander moved down the Phoenician coast to subdue the home ports, from Arados to Sidon—and all except Tyre accommodated him. The Tyrians resisted and killed Alexander’s envoys, ensuring a violent outcome. The author undertakes in detail the elaborate engineering feats that Alexander and his army used to besiege the recalcitrant Tyre, starting with the “mole,” a kind of massive pier to reach the city’s walls. Despite the ingenious resistance of the Tyrians, Alexander now had a reinforced navy arrive to block the harbor, as well as the use of his catapults and rams, and perhaps “ladders” (the author rather humorously debates the various historians on the scholarly interpretation of certain ancient Greek words), to breach the walls at last. Drawing from ancient sources as well as from modern historians, Guenther dwells extensively on the makeup of Alexander’s army and marvelous engineering for a surprisingly readable adventure.",
