    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/susana-rosique/agreement-under-the-stars/",
    "description": "Thanks to farms, homes, and development, the forest is getting smaller and smaller. Animals who used to live in harmony find themselves in a cramped, loud environment. At an emergency meeting, a committee decides that some of the animals will be active during the day, while others will be active at night. The night animals postulate that they were assigned their time slot because they aren’t as beautiful as the others. When a poacher sets traps at night, the nocturnal animals try to warn the others, who ignore their calls and wind up caught in snares, traps, and cages. Despite their treatment, the nocturnal creatures free the others from the traps and are welcomed back during the day. But the night animals decide that they prefer the welcoming peace of the forest after dark and that night is where they want to stay. This story makes an interesting comment on deforestation that is paired with an afterword explaining the topic further. Blank lined pages invite readers to note “Things I Can Do To Take Care of the Forests.” Rosique makes masterful use of color, playing the shadows of the forest and night against the vibrant reds of the diurnal creatures. The animals have realistic features and will be appealing to children. This modern parable makes for an enjoyable story as well as a conversation starter.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/carlos-j-rangel/myths-of-our-humanity-mitos-de-nuestra-humanidad/",
    "description": "Every culture has myths, stories passed down throughout history to make sense of the world. For the author, a Venezuelan businessman, writer, and political analyst, myths are also crucial to how a population conceives and protects democracy. His bilingual (English and Spanish) book arranges, in 13 sections, pieces of visual art (including paintings, comics, and photography) and corresponding text with the goal of shifting “old recognizable stories in contemporary form to illustrate in a familiar manner modern ideas” in an “an exploration of humanity’s longing for liberty.” Some pairings have direct symmetry, such as the myth of Pandora’s box accompanied by a prose piece from Pandora’s perspective about unleashing “hate, pain, sickness, famine, war, division, [and] strife” upon humanity. But Rangel eagerly plays with form: A Zeus vignette takes the form of a news article; another reads as a scene in a screenplay with Sandro Botticelli; a third uses an internal memo within a conservative political party with less-than-subtle descriptions of a candidate resembling Donald Trump. One of the most arresting sections is a gruesome comic, with an epigraph by former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, that uses a zombie apocalypse as metaphor for how citizens pay the price for political apathy and extremism, with text like “He yanks our will. I’M HUNGRY! We are his will, he tells us so” to drive the point home. The ease with which Rangel weaves ideas and struggles from centuries and millennia past into the present political landscape, both in the United States and the world beyond, has a chilling effect. But like hope, left at the bottom of Pandora’s box, there is still the feeling that we can move forward, if only we heed our past.",
