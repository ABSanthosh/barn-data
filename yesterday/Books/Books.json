    "description": "“Again and again, we are told that Adonai is and always has been merciful and compassionate,” writes Rosensaft in the book’s introduction, adding, “yet, we know that no such divine intervention…that no divine lovingkindness manifested itself at Auschwitz.” In this poetic reconfiguring of the Bible’s Book of Psalms, the author reinterprets the ancient writings (“in what may well be the ultimate manifestation of chutzpah”) in the context of the Holocaust (Rosensaft’s brother was killed in a Birkenau gas chamber in 1943). A legal scholar by trade, the author has published multiple works that combine memoir, poetry, and Holocaust remembrances. In these pages, responding to all 150 Psalms individually, the author balances his mastery of Jewish theology with a raw writing style that is unafraid to question, lash out at, and lament God’s seeming passivity in the face of evil. In his response to Psalm 23, a Biblical passage that has comforted Jewish and Christian believers for millennia, the author describes feelings of “emptiness” where there exists “no shepherd / only foes” as the children of God walk “through the valley of death.” Similarly, in his reimagining of Psalm 101, the author declares to God, “I will not sing to You…while slaughters of the innocent / remain unpunished.” As the son of Holocaust survivors who was born in a displaced persons camp in Germany shortly after the war, Rosensaft writes from a place of deep-seated pain and generational trauma. The work’s final section, “The Relentless Continuum of History,” highlights the perpetuation of antisemitic tropes (such as the notion that Jewish “killers…betrayed Christ”). One concluding poem, “Simhat Torah Requiem,” recalls the horrific events of October 7, 2023, stating that, “the ss have returned / to merge into hamas”; another laments the death of both Palestinian and Jewish children as Adonai and Allah watch in “anguish.”",

    "title": "THE MANY LIVES OF ANNE FRANK",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ruth-franklin/the-many-lives-of-anne-frank/",
    "description": "Anne Frank got her first diary as a present for her 13th birthday, just weeks before her family went into hiding in 1942. By the time she died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, not yet 16, she had filled multiple notebooks and was revising them for postwar publication before her arrest. Franklin, who won a National Book Critics Circle Award for her biography Shirley Jackson: A Rather Haunted Life, in Part 1 follows Anne from childhood in Germany to Holland and Bergen-Belsen. She spotlights Anne’s increasing maturity over the course of two years in hiding and takes a close look at her revisions as indications of “the coherent testimonial narrative she now wanted to write.” Part 2, described by Franklin as “a cultural history of the idea of Anne as it has developed since 1947,” contains some familiar material: her father Otto’s recovery and editing of the diary (he removed some of Anne’s more acerbic comments and included material she had cut as too personal); its publication and international success; the stage and movie versions criticized today for downplaying Anne’s Jewishness to make her an all-purpose icon of human endurance—these topics have been covered widely. More unusual, and quite moving, are the “interludes” testifying to the diary’s impact on individual readers across the globe. A final chapter, “Anne in the Political World,” is problematic, especially when Franklin tackles with evident discomfort the fierce debates over Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and its military response to the 2023 Hamas massacre of Israeli civilians. Speculating on how Anne might have viewed these issues if she had survived doesn’t seem particularly relevant to the general thrust of Franklin’s thoughtful book, which succeeds best in its aims of “recognizing and respecting Anne’s intentions as an author” and “reclaiming her as a human being rather than a symbol.”",
