    "description": "The family begins saving eggshells in January, carefully blowing out the yolks and whites through small holes. By the time Easter nears, they’ve collected 100 empty shells, ready to be painted in bright, vibrant colors. Next, the family members fill each egg with confetti and seal the holes with glue and tissue paper. It’s hard to wait for Easter, but when the day arrives, Papá hides the eggs in the park for the youngest family members to find. The narrator’s younger brother, Nicolás, has just learned to walk, so this will be his first egg hunt! After all the eggs are found, Nicolás gets a big surprise when his sibling shows him an especially fun tradition: cracking the filled eggs on each other’s heads, creating a colorful explosion of confetti. The children delight in the messy fun. This sweet, simple story not only carefully describes the process of making cascarones, but also captures the pure joy of cracking the eggs. The vibrant watercolor illustrations highlight the cultural celebration, with expressive faces adding to the charm. Presented in both English and Spanish (with Ventura Medina providing the Spanish translation), this bilingual story allows readers to enjoy the narrative in both languages. Characters are Latine, with brown skin and hair.",

    "description": "Five years ago, in 1984, Viktoria made a horrible mistake—during a moment of distraction, she let her 5-year-old sister disappear in the bog behind their house, a place where such events are common. Now Anna has returned, but she hasn’t aged. She can’t explain where she’s been, and the bog seems to call her back. With the oracle cards she carries as a guide, 16-year-old Vik desperately tries to figure out what to do while navigating turmoil with her closest friend, Liis, and facing the hostile villagers, who turn on her family. Although the Estonians’ language and culture have survived decades of Soviet oppression—which is loosening—some people are more interested in assimilating with Russians. The influence of Vik’s maternal uncle Silver, who supports the Soviet way of thinking and runs the government asylum just outside of town, looms large. In this politically astute story filled with skillfully incorporated background information about a fascinating and complex historical period, Vik’s quest authentically and thoroughly incorporates her struggles with OCD and complex PTSD (which Griffis explains in a mental health note but aren’t diagnosed in-world). Liis has a limb difference, and Vik’s mother has PTSD, too. This gripping, deeply human, and eerie mystery has parallels to current events that will provoke readers to think.",
