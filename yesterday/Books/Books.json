    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/james-r-olsen/make-things-in-america/",
    "description": "Despite being an “economic powerhouse,” the United States “has managed to lose much of its manufacturing prowess,” and most low-tech production has taken flight to other countries like China, observes Olsen. We cannot simply accept an economy that runs singularly on services, he asserts. “We need to make more of our own things.” Much of the problem lies in the tax code, per the author, which seems to punish the average American worker—the linchpin of the nation’s economic competitiveness—and reward risky financial speculation. To remedy the problem, Olsen lucidly proposes a sweeping tax reform plan and suggests adopting a single-payer national health care plan and a “Child Sustenance Assistance Service.” The money to pay for these programs and tax cuts will come from taxing stock market and real estate speculation, the latter of which, according to the author, not only artificially raises housing prices but also destabilizes communities (these are provocative points argued with impressive analytical rigor). Olsen’s approach is free of any partisan rhetoric or ideological axioms; in fact, he roundly criticizes both communism and free-market capitalism as “too mechanistic.” At the heart of the book is a stirring paean to the nobility of work and the central significance of the American worker to the economy as a whole. (“A foundational principle of America is that the economy’s very purpose is to serve the needs and aspirations of the American workforce.”) This is a very brief book—well under 100 pages of main text—and such a quick treatment of so many complex issues can’t be decisively persuasive. The author’s discussion of alleviating poverty is particularly vague, and seems to amount to little more than hiring more case managers. However, the true value of this slim volume is that it stimulates further discussion by offering a perspective often neglected—one that places everyday workers, rather than disruptive entrepreneurs, at the top of the nation’s economic hierarchy.",

    "title": "CHILD OF EARTH AND STARRY HEAVEN",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/l-annette-binder/child-of-earth-and-starry-heaven/",
    "description": "Binder was born in Germany and moved with her family to Colorado when she was 5 years old. Her parents continued to speak German in the house, though, much to her mother’s chagrin, Binder resisted speaking the language, which she felt marked the family as outsiders in America. It was only as an adult, as her mother was sliding into dementia, that Binder finally acquiesced in order to feel closer to her. “Sharing a language is a form of love,” she writes, “I understand this now. And when my mother doesn’t recognize me anymore, I won’t be her Lisalein, but I’ll still be with her. I’ll be the woman with the curly hair who sits beside her and speaks to her in German.” In this memoir, Binder explores her shifting relationship with her mother, Helena, during the latter’s illness, which partially coincided with the Covid-19 pandemic. At the time, Binder was living with her husband and daughter in New Hampshire and Helena had recently relocated nearby. She soon moved into a memory care facility, where Binder visited her regularly, documenting the peculiar culture of the place with its memory boxes and uninhibited residents. Sitting in Helena’s small room, Binder contemplated how memory, language, migration, and the complexities of a mother-daughter relationship had fluctuated over the course of the disease, allowing Binder to better understand Helena even as she drifted further away from her. The author writes with the probing lyricism of a poet as she wrestles to articulate her muddled emotions. “Dementia isn’t a labyrinth anymore and not the sweet lotus either,” she writes. “It’s a fire that burns inside the brain. It burns and burns and gathers strength until there’s nothing left but ashes and glowing embers. It finds its fuel in the things that make us human.” Readers will admire Binder’s refusal of sentimentality, observant eye, and determination to grasp answers that seem always on the verge of evaporation.",
