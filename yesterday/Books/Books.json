    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/axel-honneth/the-working-sovereign/",
    "description": "Most people in a given society are workers, observes Honneth in this accessible work of political philosophy, and it is “one of the major deficiencies of almost all theories of democracy” that this fact is not of central importance. Workers can be made the backbone of civil society by creating dignified conditions that promote cooperative, social behavior; if poorly run, a society will instead produce egocentric, us-against-them citizens. That’s precisely what we have, Honneth argues, because workers lack the freedom, the opportunity, and the incentive to contribute to “societal prosperity.” Whereas the Hegelian ideal of work produces independence and honor, the reality in capitalist societies is very different: workers are oppressed not just by the usual machinations of the bosses but also by such things as the fragile gig economy of the present, the suzerainty of finance and speculative capital, and the outsourcing of labor “to hugely underpaid remote workers all over the globe.” Add to that companies that break unions, that time workers’ bathroom breaks, and that view employees as fungible, and you have no chance of creating a society in which, as Adam Smith wished, “workers can fully understand the laws, accept them on rational grounds and embrace their meaning.” In short, workers are present, but they are not actors in a precarious society that does not value them. There are remedies, Honneth notes: one can reform capitalism, or one can fetter capitalism with laws and labor market reforms. He holds that a middle way between the two is “the moral order of the day,” one that contributes to human dignity and that allows workers a voice in the conditions of their labor.",

    "description": "The processes by which the United States became an economic superpower are still being unraveled, but University of Wisconsin historian Dunlavy provides another piece of the puzzle with this short, pithy book. At first glance, the subject of manufacturing standardization might not seem an interesting one, yet this book turns out to be a fascinating read. Dunlavy looks back to the early years of the 20th century, when manufacturing was largely based on the production of goods—everything from beds to bricks—in a bewildering array of sizes and types. Henry Ford’s methods had shown the value of mass production, but the idea had not yet spread throughout the economy. The dominant business thinking was that consumers preferred wide variety over low prices. This changed with World War I, when the government encouraged manufacturers of war-related material to adopt mass-production techniques for greater efficiency and less waste. It worked, but many companies returned to their old ways after the end of the war. Enter Herbert Hoover, who became secretary of commerce in 1921 (and later president). He created the Division of Simplified Practice, which pumped out reams of data to show the benefits. The methods spread, and by World War II the economy turned into a mass-production powerhouse. Standardization would also show the value of cooperation between government, businesses, and industry associations. Dunlavy recounts the story with an efficiency that matches her subject, making her book relevant for anyone interested in the history of business.",
