    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/darrell-kinsey/natch/",
    "description": "Kinsey’s taut novel tells a straightforward story, but it’s the voice that stands out most. The note of regret its narrator takes when recalling a woman named Asha hints that the story we’re about to hear won’t be a happy one. “I was afraid if I thought about her, her voice would wake up on the inside of my mind,” the narrator declares—but soon enough he begins to tell the story of how he and Asha fell in love. At the time the book opens, the protagonist is 29 and has been working in tree removal for the last 11 years. He’s immediately taken when he meets Asha, who would like to become a therapist one day and has a penchant for belly dancing. Before long, the couple is expecting a child, and much of the book covers how these two fiercely independent people reckon with impending parenthood. There’s an immediacy to Kinsey’s prose that makes scenes like one of the narrator and Asha trying to catch a gar stand out. But there are hints of something bleaker below the surface: The narrator’s temper flares up at times, and he misgenders his opponent after an arm-wrestling match. Asha and the narrator’s child dies in the womb, which leads both of them into deep depression. “I was thinking of it like a miscarriage, but it wasn’t the same as a miscarriage,” the narrator muses. Things get bleaker from there, with the couple facing financial precarity before things reach points of tragedy and redemption. The book is uneven, but its mournful voice is hard to shake.",

    "description": "A relentless bully who posts popular videos of his humiliating attacks, and a bossy new classmate aiming to replace her as leader of the Detective Club, may seem like tough challenges for Minerva Keen, but what really gets her attention is how her once-friendly language arts teacher, Claire Voyant, has abruptly turned harsh and dismissive—almost (could it be possible?) as if she were a different person. Ever alert for mysteries to solve—even if a bit of illegal surveillance or breaking and entering is required—Minerva forges ahead. Her outrageously reckless little brother, Heck, is a willing ally, shy best friend and schoolmate Silent Santos is a reluctant one, and (surprise!) even Zoe Quick, a rival overachiever with serious hacking skills, eventually comes on board. Catering equally to readers who relish their crime capers on the comical or scary sides, the co-authors again dish up a rousing combo platter with awkward mishaps, frequent barfing and belching, and sloppy food fights as well as a juicy round of robbery, kidnapping, and attempted murder. Once just deserts have been dealt out all round, the caper leaves Minerva and Heck with just one tantalizing question: Are their enigmatic, often-absent parents actually secret agents? Stay tuned. Minerva presents white, and Santos and Zoe read Black. Final art not seen.",
