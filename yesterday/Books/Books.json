    "description": "As part of Oxford University Press’ My Reading series, award-winning novelist, poet, memoirist, and playwright Roberts offers intimate reflections about her connection to Colette (1873-1954) by considering four texts that had particular significance for her: My Mother’s House, a prismatic memoir of linked stories; Break of Day, an autobiographical novel; Chéri, Colette’s famous tale of a seductive gigolo and his aging mistress; and The Rainy Moon, a novella that Roberts first read during a particularly dark time when she was in her 30s. Raised in the “grip of Catholic morality” by a strict, undemonstrative mother, sent to a convent school that instilled a sense of “self-hatred as a woman,” the young Roberts discovered in Colette “an enticing landscape distinguished by its straightforwardly amoral celebration of sensuality.” My Mother’s House, in which Colette’s mother, Sido, “appears as a figure of powerful, overarching mythic status,” helped Roberts to rethink her relationship with her own overpowering mother and to find her way back “to that unsentimental, strong, practical French woman.” Colette showed her a new way to think about femininity as well, not as self-abnegation or inferiority to men, but “as a performance or a disguise or a fancy-dress costume.” For Colette, Roberts asserts, writing was aggressive, in keeping with her celebration of her “robust, healthy body” and voracious appetites. Besides highlighting themes of women’s independence and agency, Roberts reveals ways that Colette shaped her as a writer: teaching her, for example, that there was “a wealth of ways to use autobiographical material”; presenting prodigious examples of “supple and muscular” prose, skillfully shaped characters and dialogue, and writing replete with sensuous textures and sharply observed details.",

    "title": "DANTE'S DIVINE COMEDY",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/joseph-luzzi/dantes-divine-comedy-2/",
    "description": "Bard College literature scholar Luzzi posits that Dante was “an intensely experimental writer,” one reason that centuries later James Joyce would take so many cues from him. Dante was experimental, Luzzi continues, first because he did not write his Divine Comedy in Latin—a choice that limited his audience, since all literate Europeans would know Latin but almost certainly not the Tuscan dialect of Italian. Tuscan, in turn, and particularly the Tuscan spoken in Florence, provided Dante with a vigorous language that “could capture the intimate rhythms, cadences, and meanings of everyday speech and, by extension, the resonances and experiences of daily life.” Despite Dante’s enthusiasm for the language and ways of Florence, the city banished him in 1302, which, though infuriating, convinced Dante that he was on a mission from God to write a sacred poem that would explain the workings of heaven, purgatory, and hell. It took time for that word to spread; as Luzzi notes, “by the end of the 1300s, about eight hundred manuscripts of the Commedia were in circulation.” The introduction of movable type and translations into other languages made it a world classic, if long after Dante’s own lifetime. Perhaps ironically, Luzzi notes, one particularly close reader of Dante’s text was a “zealous Spanish cleric” working under the auspices of the Inquisition, who diligently crossed out passages that placed wayward popes and priests in hell and condemned “a Vatican that ‘fornicates’ with kings.” Perhaps it’s a sign of divine approval that the censor’s strikethroughs have faded away and Dante’s original text shines through.",
