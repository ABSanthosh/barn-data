    "description": "Sam is a 30-something poet finally pursuing the college degree she promised herself she would earn, but the experience lacks luster. Her new boyfriend, Steven, a professor from her program, has a research grant to go to Boston; moving there seems like a promising new start and a way to gain clarity about what she wants to do with her life, but Sam keeps getting dragged back into her past. Her alcoholic ex-boyfriend Timothy is still a fixture, as are the memories of a difficult childhood spent living under the eye of her abusive grandmother that keep threatening to surface. In Boston, Sam finds her creative need to write poetry comes second to Steven’s work; she finds solace in new friend Martin Alistair, son of legendary feminist publisher Edith Alistair. Sam reads Edith’s diaries about her publishing house—part of Steven’s research that he seems surprised she is fascinated by—while simultaneously writing poetry. From the novel’s opening line (“Happiness was a shock. So was knowing she belonged”), Parrish writes lyrically, conveying the creativity of her heroine while also displaying her own skill as a published poet. This is particularly evident as Sam works through a recurring motif of her childhood trauma, turning a terrible memory into an affecting poem. Though both Timothy and Steven feature heavily in the story (occasionally, it feels a little unclear as to whether they are meant to present a love triangle for Sam), the most compelling aspect of the narrative is the central character’s journey as she finds her footing and truly addresses her own needs. Readers will find themselves rooting for Sam, a woman in her 30s, as if this is her coming-of-age tale.",

    "description": "The Glory Peak Ski Resort is founded in 1966 by Bill Macklemore, a World War II veteran–turned–ski instructor who developed a site near Fortooth into a premier skiing destination (it is said that “Fortooth was one of those towns where reality was far more potent than myth”). His devotion to his business is so all-encompassing that his wife, Suzanne, leaves him, taking along their son, Bobby. Fast forward a few decades: Bill is expanding the ski resort, and Bobby is married to a woman named Annabelle. Bobby does not approve of the way Bill is expanding the ski runs, and the local Indigenous Le’Echuwanna people aren’t happy, either. Annabelle and Bobby have a daughter named Clover, who is the company’s presumed heir, but things change when her grandmother, Nanny A, a former professor, strident feminist, and shrewd businesswoman, arrives. Family obligations bring Nanny A to town, but business interests keep her there: She bands together with her daughter’s former lover, Gunther (a German skier and videographer), to take his company Wolfehaus into the stratosphere as Clover’s inheritance (if she even wants it) and the family legacy hang in the balance. Abrams’ small but remarkable cast of characters occupy a world in the Pacific Northwest that is a sight to behold. The towering achievements, business acumen, and grand ambition on display make for an engrossing story about family that is as grounded as it is lofty. All is not perfect at the foot of the mountain, and the difficult relationships are characterized with compelling emotional detail. Family legacy is key in this novel, but there are some literal cliffhanger moments that keep the story exciting. The narrative is told out of chronological sequence, but the author’s gift for storytelling keeps everything in sync.",
