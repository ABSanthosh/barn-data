    "description": "Twenty-five years into his prolific career, Lemire (Minor Arcana, 2025, etc.) humbly reflects on his expansive bibliography and guides readers through his progression from producing his own self-published zines to inking production deals with Netflix. Each chapter primarily focuses on one book’s genesis and is packed with character studies, sketches, and archival photos. Lemire worked constantly, committed himself to his craft, and held on to stories and ideas for years before finding the bandwidth to develop them. Starting in the mid-’90s, he recounts self-publishing and distributing his own comics while living in Toronto. (His first zine, Ashtray #1, is reprinted in full in the book’s appendix.) He won a Xeric Grant in 2005 for his book Lost Dogs, which garnered the attention of small publishing houses. While working on his Essex County books in 2007-2008, DC Comics showed interest and opened a door that led to multiyear runs of mainstream comics like Trillium, Animal Man, and Sweet Tooth (now a Netflix series). After leaving DC for a disappointing stint at Marvel, Lemire now prioritizes his creator-owned serials. His memoir is written not as a comic but as a straightforward text, and frequent clichés suggest that, compared to the taut action of his comics, this format might require more words than Lemire is accustomed to working with. His early years were “a roller coaster of exciting things”; writing volume 2 of Essex County was “just…incredible.” While at DC, “learning how to write mainstream comics was only half the battle,” and a pitch meeting was “just throwing stuff against the wall and seeing what stuck.” On his initial breakthrough with DC/Vertigo, he says, “Talk about being at the right place at the right time.” Despite some clunky prose, the book’s lavish trove of behind-the-scenes lore and Lemire’s unbridled energy are capable of inspiring budding cartoonists.",

    "description": "The unnamed, single narrator works in journalism in New York City, covering topics large and small, local and national, in an editor-enforced“Plain-Jane…styleless” style, which makes her feel a hack. She has two roommates: Leon, a friend since childhood, and Susannah, a poet and e-commerce support staffer; another longtime pal, Ruth, shares the up and downs of her marriage and caring for her baby. Lonely and adrift, she doesn’t feel comfortable with her father (who’s remarried), her well-meaning but casually cruel mother, or her crowded rental apartment. She attends parties filled with people she doesn't know, has brief interactions with passing strangers, and tries to find love. Although other characters haphazardly bounce into and out of the narrative, her love interests receive the most attention—particularly Simon, a musician and paralegal with endearing and frustrating traits. The narrative is composed mostly of brief sketches of sensation, emotion, and action with no clear narrative thread, which gives the work an ethereal feel. Lewis skillfully wields sparse language to highlight the daily mundanities of navigating friendships, romantic relationships, and work, and also addresses the complexities of abortion. Occasionally, the sparsity gives way to beautiful imagery: “The river outside the window was motion and light, liquid hues like still-wet paint.” Small sensory details also breathe life into scenes: “Back at the house, my father’s trees bend in the curve of the wine glasses as I set the table.” Scenes of sex and flirtation appear often, as though the narrator wants to be reassured of her desirability; she also regularly highlights the technological changes rushing through society, as when a child thinks that “Don’t forget to subscribe!” means goodbye.",
