    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/emma-bettridge/he-ranch-at-the-end-of-the-world/",
    "description": "New arrivals to Ransh Cyfle Olaf, or Last Chance Ranch, learn that “this isn’t prison; this isn’t holiday camp. This is a place to start at the beginning.” The novel opens with Nell and four other young people on a bus in rural Wales. Nell tells readers, “I’m quick to rage, will flip if pushed, and I like girls.” As she does chores, tends to the horses, and explores the hills, forest, and river surrounding the ranch, Nell makes new friends, including Fran, whose mother runs the farm. Both Nell and Fran have had complicated relationships with girls they fell for who then betrayed their trust. Nell also discovers that she can calm Gully, a horse who’s anxious around people due to previous mistreatment. As Nell begins to heal, the complicated details of her past come to light. The climax unspools with a dramatic event that takes Nell and Fran into the hills. The conclusion is, realistically, not tied up neatly, and readers, especially those who feel different in any way, will be satisfied with the romance, friendship, and sense of mental quiet. Bettridge’s writing is descriptive and lyrical as well as accessible to reluctant readers. Nell’s first-person voice rings true as she details her time away from the modern world. Most characters present white; in Birch’s fluid, impressionistic art, Zed has brown skin and curly black hair.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/renee-d-bondy/nondisclosure-2/",
    "description": "Growing up a Catholic schoolgirl in 1970s Ontario, the nameless protagonist of Bondy’s debut novel does just about everything that's expected of her, from joining the choir to helping out the priest at the rectory with various tasks. The narrator knows she’s no standout, and she likes it that way: “I’d always been quiet…I wore quiet like a woolen shawl, protective and comforting.” But it is perhaps this very lack of remarkableness that makes her a target for the pedophile priest—”Father Feeler”—at her parish. Years later, after she's found her calling by opening up her home as a hospice for gay men dying of AIDS—who were mistreated, or failed to be treated, at traditional hospitals and banned from seeing their partners or friends—other victims of the priest begin to come forward. As the narrator weighs whether or not to join them in telling her story, she learns the insidious power that secrets have to fracture families and communities—as well as how healing might be possible. In the novel’s afterword, Bondy reveals the novel’s inspiration as a real-life case out of Chatham, Ontario, and her desire to explore the lesser-known stories of female victims of church abuse. The necessity for home hospice networks for AIDS patients in the 1980s was also, sadly, very real. Bondy’s decision to juxtapose the two scenarios gives the novel much of its power. But the nameless protagonist—who sometimes shifts into the plural first person—seems designed to be a kind of everywoman for victims and so never develops a vivid personhood of her own, undoing some of Bondy’s intentions to move and outrage the reader through the power of fiction.",
