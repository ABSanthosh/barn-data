    "description": "Nineteen-year-old Estrid and her shadow-wolf familiar Rafe incapacitate a group of soldiers in an effort to protect a local village—Estrid accomplishes this with dark, powerful magic to fulfill an oath she’s taken to make up for the lives of innocents she’s claimed in the past (“a heavy debt she’s not sure will ever be repaid”). She encounters a person called Zain unconscious in the nearby wilderness and takes him in to nurse him back to health. During their time together, they discover that their combined magic has the power to resurrect the dead, which they demonstrate on a bird. They are attracted to one another, but Zain reveals he’s “Fae” and King of the Summer Court; when his companions Del and Alvey come for him, he must go with them to protect his realm from the evildoings of Rodden, the King of Nordia, who threatens his reign. Estrid helps strategize, having previously been under Rodden’s control and therefore familiar with his tactics. However, as they approach his stronghold, Estrid is captured. Zain solicits help from Del and other allies to rescue her from a dungeon. They seek help from the Shadow Court—whose King Cethin is revealed to have an intimate connection with one among the group. Sirota excels in creating dynamic characters like Estrid and Zain, with complex backstories drawn from the similarly elaborate worldbuilding. The author conveys a palpable attraction between them—their erotic scenes are treated with a deft hand and effectively convey the characters’ growing connection to each other, propelling the plot forward. However, the inception of their relationship feels a bit rushed, and some secondary characters could benefit from additional development. While Estrid’s magic is a central element, its limitations are murkily defined, which may prove frustrating for some readers. Nonetheless, this opening installment lays a strong foundation for a sequel. Fans of high fantasy and romance alike will enjoy Sirota’s tale, which successfully highlights aspects of both genres.",

    "title": "DYLAN THOMAS",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/john-goodby/dylan-thomas-critical-lives/",
    "description": "In the latest in the Critical Lives series, Goodby and Wigginton, Thomas scholars at Sheffield Hallam University, offer a brisk but comprehensive look at the life of Dylan Thomas (1914-1953), eschewing the popular image of a “rumpled, Dionysiac…summoner of elemental powers” in favor of a more nuanced portrait of a driven, focused writer who had penned a dozen “masterpieces” by the time he was 19-and-a-half. The book moves confidently through Thomas’ upbringing in a “middling prosperous” suburb of Swansea, his grammar school education, and his complicated relationship with his father, D.J., who named his son after a character in a Welsh medieval tale. From there we progress to the poet’s early adulthood, and the authors make note of both Thomas’ periods of intense productivity and his ambition; after his first collection, 18 Poems, was published in 1934 to not insignificant acclaim, Thomas wanted to build on its success “as quickly as possible,” and Twenty-Five Poems was published less than two years later. In between the two collections, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara, whom he would marry. Next, the authors address World War II and its effect on Thomas, as well as his work making wartime documentaries for Strand Films, concluding with the poet’s four tours of America in the early 1950s before his untimely death at the age of 39. This slim volume ably summarizes the events of the poet’s life, but where it “fill[s] a gap” is in the “critically informed attention” it pays to Thomas’ writing, offering close reads of many of the poems and the “puns, wordplay and rhetorical devices” he employed. “The life is read in the light of [Thomas’] work, rather than the other way around,” the authors write.",
