    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/joelle-babula/infidelity-rules/",
    "description": "When it comes to getting involved with men, independent Quinn, a gorgeous, green-eyed, 6-foot-tall redhead, has one unshakeable rule: They have to be unhappily married, with no kids. (After all, she’s no homewrecker.) Having sworn off marriage after two failures, only hot sex and romance with no expectations on either side does it for Quinn. (The fact that she’ll eventually have to pay for her cavalier disregard for the wives of her short-term lovers hardly comes as a surprise, but the author’s audacious twist on the inevitable comeuppance does, thankfully leaving her hero’s spiky, bright spirit undimmed.) Quinn’s eventual realization that her determined, no-strings approach to relationships has consequences begins when Marcus, “the one whose mere presence zaps my appetite, flushes my cheeks and makes me want to giggle like a schoolgirl mooning over her first crush,” walks into the upscale restaurant where Quinn is the wine- and food-savvy sommelier. “I love the magic that happens when a great glass of wine pairs perfectly with a dish,” she says. “It’s lusty and romantic…. It’s akin to the ideal relationship, fleeting but swoon-worthy.” Perfect though he seems, if Marcus isn’t married, Quinn will have to go with her second choice, a handsome, married, infidelity newbie. The author’s lavish descriptions of clothes, gourmet meals, and wine—some chapters open with a description of enticing menu offerings—and the characters’ nearly exclusive focus on hormone-charged relationships make for an engaging rom-com Sex and the City vibe. When she can no longer ignore the messy realities of her affairs, it takes time for Quinn to get past her defensive reaction and face a difficult decision: “I don’t feel guilty. I didn’t make any vows,” she says. The author doesn’t let her off the hook, but the off-the-wall result satisfies, and humor and a light touch are ever-present (Quinn’s blind date with a picky vegetarian at her Italian mother’s bountiful, nonvegetarian dinner table is a kick).",

    "title": "THE METAMORPHOSIS OF BUNNY BAXTER",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/barbara-carroll-roberts/the-metamorphosis-of-bunny-baxter/",
    "description": "Thanks to her great mop of flaming-red hair and some unfortunate incidents on the first day, Theodosia “Bunny” Baxter’s hopes of invisibly blending in at her new middle school may be dashed. But the ensuing notoriety leaves her alternative scheme—being expelled, so she can go to school with her best friend—all the more doable. Or so she thinks. As it turns out, she’s not very good at bad behavior, among the many endearing qualities that will draw readers to her. Bunny fumbles her way toward successfully coping with many things, including bullying, pressure to sign up for an athletic competition, complex feelings about being adopted, and anxiety attacks that manifest in part as serious rashes. Roberts tucks engaging classroom activities into this already thematically robust tale—like the fizzy social dynamics in an experimental initiative-building class called Discoveries, the ins and outs of creating a garden of native plants, and tagging monarch butterflies—as she artfully tracks a profound transformation in her protagonist’s sense of self. The changes may be Bunny’s doing, but she’s helped along by a generously sized cast of almost uniformly supportive adults and peers (plus one great dog). By the book’s buoyant end, even one prickly girl’s repeated insistence that she’s not Bunny’s friend is sounding hollow. Bunny is cued white, and there’s some racial diversity in the supporting cast.",
