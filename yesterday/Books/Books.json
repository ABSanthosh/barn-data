    "description": "At the age of 19, the author took a job as a dental assistant to the man who would become her romantic partner. Robert, or “Tosh”—the name he would take when he became a disciple of Rajneesh—was 27 and married, with a young daughter. Still, the two soon became lovers, until Rudell realized Tosh had no plans to leave his wife. Deciding to move on, she married another man and had a son, Gavin. But that marriage broke up, and four years after first meeting him, Rudell went back to work with Tosh, who was now separated from his wife. She and Tosh were kindred souls, both seeking a higher spirituality. In 1981, when Tosh was invited to be the dentist for a new commune called Rajneeshpuram, established in the Oregon desert, they joined the leader Bhagwan’s followers. They remained for several years, until Bhagwan was arrested and deported to India. In 1988, now married, the couple left the cult and moved to Kauai, where an old sailing vessel, the Elixir, awaited them (“she was the biggest boat in the yard and in far worse shape than the photos we’d seen”). Their goal was to rebuild the boat over a six-month period; the project took five years. Rudell uses the years in Kauai as the geographical anchor for a complex memoir that shifts back and forth through time. As the author works on the boat, she ruminates on the commune, sharing an uncensored, visceral portrait of life within the cult—the good, the bad, and the very ugly. The narrative is also a detailed account of boat restoration, full of minutia about refurbishing every piece of wood, sail, line, and piece of brass; these segments are both compelling and exhausting. Most riveting are the sections recounting the perilous journey across the Pacific as the crew navigated the Elixir through storms and roiling seas, with Tosh deathly seasick throughout the entire voyage.",

    "description": "Issey is an enthusiastic burglar living in an attic apartment in present-day Boston. He’s part of a collective of crooks who rob and fence delicate valuables, priceless heirlooms, and other items from the ritzy neighborhoods and campuses of Boston and Cambridge. Unfortunately for Issey, the group has had enough of him bringing only knickknacks of minor value to the table, and they’re set to kick him out before their mysterious, large-scale “Faneuil Hall job.” Issey pleads for one more chance, but then he receives a call from his brother, to whom he hasn’t spoken in years; he informs him that their mother has remarried and moved away. Issey agrees to return home to Vermont to clear out her collection of fancy vases—which he’d stolen from others. Once there, he meets Rohel’s sharp-tongued wife, Anissa, and finds out that his brother wants to sell their mom’s house. Issey continues his thieving ways in Vermont, and before long, he’s accused of stealing three horses from a local named Avi; he didsteal many things from Avi, but not his horses. His search for the animals strangely makes him a local hero. However, as in other good books about crooks, an associate from Issey’s past lurks in the shadows. Many novels about thieves promise humor, but Grosvenor’s is a rare one that actually delivers: “Issey was getting beaten up a lot these days. More than usual. Was he just terrible at this now?” Readers will easily relate to Issey and the mismatch of his ambitions and abilities—as well as conviction that looking the part of the erudite thief is almost as important as what he steals. The settings, too, are well-rendered, especially when the narrative shifts to Vermont: “The air has a purity that cuts through scavengers and liars.” Overall, it’s a satisfying read, featuring a reluctant hero who’s sure to keep readers chuckling.",
