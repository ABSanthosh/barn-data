    "description": "The Hellas Station is a trailblazing Mars colony staffed by only a handful of international, highly competent astronauts. One of these exceptional colonists is extra-special: Adam Flynn is the first human born on Mars (sadly, his mother died from cancer in the radiation-rich environment). Seventeen-year-old Adam has matured to be a survival-hardened and resourceful youth who has helped to ready Hellas Station for an influx of nearly 100 new settlers, all of whom are on a long, one-way trip and expect to spend the rest of their lives on the red planet. But Adam is emotionally unprepared for the arrival of the group, which includes 25 more young people, many of them genius-level high-achievers. They all know Adam‚Äôs story (unbeknownst to him, the first ‚ÄúMartian‚Äù boy is a celebrity figure on Earth) and treat him with a blend of curiosity and disdain. The military commander of the newcomers, Col. Griggs, is a glory-seeking, aggressive type (with two not-so-nice teenagers of his own) who usurps the authority of the established colonists and is particularly condescending to Adam, insisting he is just a ‚Äúkid‚Äù and ignoring hisadvice on all matters Martian. Things begin to go badly: Adam notices an especially powerful dust storm bearing down on the complex, and the installation‚Äôs power failures are traced to a frightening infestation by a hitherto-unsuspected Martian life form. At first appearing as dark patches or tiny larvae, the marauders turn out to be countless beetlelike insects. Of course, Col. Griggs and his Earth allies vainly perceive the discovery of life on another planet as an opportunity for naming rights, and as a new potential food source. Adam, on the other hand, figures out quickly that it is the humans who are on the menu.The first-person-narrated story begins on a note recalling Andy Weir‚Äôs popular novel The Martian¬†(2011), sharing an emphasis on the hard science of exoplanet survival skills and making the most of limited resources, with the added YA-friendly perspective of a teen hero with a (very) circumscribed upbringing abruptly coming to terms with having other humans around who are his own age, particularly of the macho-jock and mean-girl sort. (Whatever raging-hormones youthful romance happens here is dialed considerably down.) At around the midway point, with the onslaught of the bug menace, things take a more Hollywood action-movie turn, which is ironic considering how frequently the youthful characters reference celluloid SF (especially 1986‚Äôs Aliens) and deny that their plight resembles hack scriptwriting: ‚ÄúIf this were a movie, I‚Äôd grin triumphantly and say something clever. She‚Äôd laugh and give me a fist-bump. Except my life doesn‚Äôt seem to be shaping into that kind of movie.‚Äù Actually, that really is more or less what transpires, with Adam and select others doing superheroic acts in an oxygen-starved atmosphere and facing off against unimaginable hordes with the most meagre homebrew weaponry while tossing off courageous asides. There is gruesome gore and a shocking body count, underlying the message that haughty grown-ups should give more credence to precocious astro-kids, especially when it comes to monsters.",

    "title": "BUILD A SANDCASTLE",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/eileen-rajala-meyer/build-a-sandcastle/",
    "description": "A young child spends the day on the beach and receives advice on how to build the perfect sandcastle. The child is first encouraged to ask a friend to help. The pair then builds a solid base by forming a crater in a sand hill and packing it down. The book offers different options for building, such as two different methods to form castle towers (‚Äústack soupy pancakes‚Äù or use ‚Äúbuckets and forms‚Äù). Once the castle is complete, the author suggests various tips for landscaping, decorating, and moat-building. The main text is written in verse with an AABB rhyme scheme. (The text occasionally visually reflects its own meaning‚Äîeach word of the phrase ‚Äúhip hip hooray‚Äù is bigger than the last, for example). Each page features a box with (nonrhyming) tips from a starfish, like first testing the sand to determine whether it‚Äôs a suitable spot for building: ‚ÄúScoop up a handful of damp sand, squeeze it tightly, and then open your hand. If the sand ball stays together, you‚Äôve found a good place. If it falls apart, keep hunting.‚Äù A helpful checklist ensures readers will have everything they need for their own beach day. Musil‚Äôs artwork features adorable, brightly colored fabric pieces arranged to depict the two children interacting with both their surroundings and various little sea creatures (including a crab taking a picture of their completed sandcastle). The story itself is fun in its musical rhythm (‚ÄúGrab a pail. A tube works, too. / (Any hollow form will do.)‚Äù) and informative‚Äîin addition to building suggestions, the starfish tips provide further relevant information, like facts about sand and advice about avoiding damaging sea turtles‚Äô nests while creating castles). Meyer has crafted a charming and joyous celebration of friendship, artistry, and nature in a surprisingly small package that is a true delight to read.",
