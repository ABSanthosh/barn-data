    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/bill-burkland/the-misconceived-conception-of-a-baby-named-jesus/",
    "description": "The story begins with biblical figures Isaiah and Micah delivering prophecies. Isaiah is depicted as a drunkard whose prophecies are intentionally ambiguous, while Micah communicates mostly with a group of cats. The latter learns of Isaiah’s prophecy of a virgin birth and tries to one-up him by predicting that the birth will be in Bethlehem. Joseph is a humble carpenter from Nazareth, while Mary is a strong-willed young woman sent to that town by her parents to separate her from her rebellious friend, Vashti. Mary and Joseph develop a romantic relationship, and as they travel to Bethlehem for the Roman census, they anticipate the disapproval of Mary's strict, religious parents. When they arrive, they meet “The Keeper,” a 103-year-old innkeeper who helps Mary bring her child into the world in a stable. Mary’s father, Jerome, and the High Priest join forces and convince drunken shepherds to spread a fabricated story about an angelic visitation and coerce the Wise Men to proclaim the miracle of Jesus’ birth. Soon, Mary, Joseph, and baby Jesus leave Bethlehem to escape the ensuing chaos. As the family settles into their journey, they reflect on the strange events that have shaped their lives; the story concludes in a modern setting. Burkland’s satirical recasting of the New Testament account of Jesus’ origins is most successful in its humorous character descriptions, as when it paints Jerome as “a noodle of a man with…rapidly receding hair that looked as though a handful of thin, lethargic worms had been indiscriminately dumped on top of his tiny head.” The dialogue is similarly clever, as it offers critiques of the era’s conventions, as when Mary’s mother, Elisheba, says to her daughter: “You may be a grown woman of fourteen, but you are in my house.” Devout Christian readers will take issue with some aspects of the tale, but overall, it offers a humorous departure from the original text that many readers will enjoy.",

    "description": "In the mid-14th century, Jeanne de Flandre, a Breton aristocrat, is an independent and insightful woman happily married to John Montfort, who respects her intellect and counsel “because she always used her insights to further his position.” When John is named Duke of Brittany in the will of his half-brother Duke John III, the dying duke’s niece, Jeanne de Penthièvre (daughter of John III’s deceased full brother, Guy) is incensed. Against a backdrop of shifting alliances among the towns and villages of Brittany, rumor-mongering among the French royalty, and court machinations that result in the invalidation of Duke John III’s will, King Philip of France imprisons John. John charges Jeanne to “do nothing to jeopardize the possibility of regaining the title and securing our son’s rightful inheritance…for now, our cause is in your hands.” She moves their young son and daughter, along with a small loyal army and the ducal treasury, to safe havens in Rennes and then Hennebort. Her leadership in routing the army that is laying siege to Hennebort is an inspiration to the fiercely independent Bretons, who dub her “Jeanne de la Flamme.” She forges an alliance with King Edward III of England, who needs Brittany’s help for his own designs on the French throne. Edward convinces her to bring her children to England for their safety…then turns the tables on her. Taylor builds on historical events with believable dialogue and action to bring Jeanne de Flandre to life as a fully realized woman. Political intrigue, ship movements, and battle plans mix with details of everyday life in the mid-1300s to propulsively move the story forward. Weaving Jeanne’s analysis into the narrative adds depth. Much like the fiction of Bernard Cornwell and Philipa Gregory, this book will enchant readers interested in well researched historical fiction.",
