    "description": "After a disastrous debacle with her former best friend and their Dungeons \u0026 Dragons group, 16-year-old Quinn finally has a chance to start over in a new town close to her beloved grandmother. On her first day of school, she meets Kashvi, who invites Quinn to join her D\u0026D group’s latest livestreamed campaign. Quinn falls in easily with Kashvi and her friends, including Dungeon Master Sloane (who uses they/them pronouns), Kashvi’s twin brother, Sanjiv, and classmate Logan, whom Quinn instantly falls for. The only problem? The group has a hard and fast policy against its members dating each other. Making matters more complicated, Quinn’s grandmother has decided that Quinn and Logan are meant to be—and she’ll do whatever it takes to bring them together. As the D\u0026D campaign ramps up, Quinn is faced with a conundrum: Can she suppress her feelings for Logan while battling imaginary dragons and real-life trolls by his side? Throughout, Boyce successfully melds humor with heartfelt moments, especially evidenced in the scenes involving Quinn’s grandmother. The portrayal of the D\u0026D group’s dynamics is nuanced and realistic, peppered with sharp dialogue and snappy quips. Quinn and Logan’s relationship is a torturous slow burn with a payoff that’s worth the wait. Most major characters are coded white; Kashvi and Sanjiv are South Asian.",

    "description": "Finley has big dreams of becoming a podcast host. Her football player boyfriend, Jensen, has been supportive and has helped her prep for the auditions for the school’s podcast, which is hosted only by seniors. Finley is hoping to garner a co-host gig—a coveted spot that opens the door to an internship at the community college. But Jensen surprises her when he tries out, too. To her shock, he’s named a co-host, and she only gets a research position. Making it worse, during a hot mic moment on the school’s PA system, Jensen insults Finley’s podcasting abilities. Finley decides that since he stole her podcast host dream, she’s going to hit him where it hurts: football. Theo, Jensen’s nemesis on the team, is popular, good-looking, wealthy, and well-dressed. At a party at Theo’s house, former soccer player Finley discovers she’s good at kicking a football. Theo agrees to coach her, with the goal of taking away Jensen’s coveted spot as kicker. There’s chemistry between Finley and Theo, and their flirtatious relationship intensifies during their training. Finley’s first-person narration explores the ups and downs of self-esteem, self-doubt, and self-reflection that many high schoolers grapple with. Romance is the driving force of this endearing story’s momentum. Finley and Jensen read white, while Theo is cued Latine.",
