    "description": "Charlie the dog loves to travel (“How does he get around, you ask? He’s got a trick, it’s true! He gives his tail a little wag and ends up someplace new”), and in this picture book he takes in New York City’s traditional sightseeing highlights. He visits the Central Park Zoo and One World Trade Center, and checks out a Broadway show and Times Square. Charlie also views the city from atop the Empire State Building, cruises around the Statue of Liberty, and enjoys New York–style culinary pleasures (pizza and hot dogs). After a long day, Charlie heads home for relaxation and slumber following an enjoyable urban exploration. The text’s simple rhyme scheme focuses attention on rhyme and sounds, which can enhance early literacy skills. Sjöström’s illustrations—which combine the soft color palette and feel of traditional watercolors—portray both the time of day and the story’s happenings (a map at the book’s beginning highlights all of the places Charlie will visit) in a clear and aesthetically pleasing manner. The lovely images are primed to ignite wanderlust in young readers and encourage a desire for pursuing new experiences; this is especially true of Charlie’s picture wall, where he adds his photographic mementos of all the places he visits.",

    "description": "Artificial intelligence, according to its advocates, holds out the promise of an end to mind-numbing, exploitative work. Casilli, a professor of sociology at the Institut Polytechnique de Paris and the author of numerous books on the social impact of technology, vehemently disagrees. He argues that it has merely changed the type of labor and the structure of the exploitation, and he has a mountain of research to support his case. AI systems are far from autonomous, he says. To get them to work at all requires the input of huge amounts of data, and there is a constant need for additions, checks, and revisions. The work is usually done not by employees but by contractors. The pay is poor and the benefits are nonexistent. Casilli provides several case studies to illustrate his points, with Amazon’s Mechanical Turk being the most illustrative. The service uses an army of freelance “clickworkers” around the globe for various types of data input, with the unifying factor being the poor rates of remuneration. Casilli acknowledges that AI is evolving at a startling rate but that probably means that it will require more human input at the lower end of the value scale, not less. He proposes a “universal digital income,” a basic level for digital workers that could be partly financed by a tax on platforms. It is a compelling idea, but implementation would be difficult. In any case, Casilli has identified a host of problems in the brave new world of AI, and perhaps this book can be a good place to start thinking about solutions.",
