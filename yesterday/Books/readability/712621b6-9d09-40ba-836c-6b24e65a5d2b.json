  "description": "In the time she’s not spending wrangling her 6-year-old twins, Taylorsford Library director Amy Muir is busy with an arts festival and the premiere performance of her husband Richard’s new dance company. The Friends of the Library association has invited true-crime author Maureen Dryden to speak at their book sale; her best-known book claims to have solved the still officially unsolved murder of a woman named Beverly Baron. Maureen is accompanied to town by her assistant, Sean Gordon, along with Terrell Temkin and Mindy LaSalle, podcasters collaborating on her new book, an anthology of cold cases including the disappearance of low-level drug dealer Edward Jaffe from the Taylorsford area. She tells her audience that her research has turned up a couple of names—Delbert Frye and Karl Klass—and asks whether anyone knows them. That request will have fatal consequences. Frye is a recluse who still lives in the area, and Klass, a former drug dealer, has transformed himself into wealthy art dealer Kurt Kendrick. Kurt is a friend of the Muirs and Amy’s Aunt Lydia, whose first husband, a famous artist, was Kurt’s close friend in their youth. When Maureen is found dead in her hotel room, the sheriff, suspecting that her death may be connected to the cold case, asks Amy to research Jaffe. Maureen’s book on the Baron murder accused a man named Allen Cardullo, who then died by suicide, opening the possibility of a revenge killing. Amy’s investigation leads to threatening notes and reveals unwelcome connections to her own family.",

  "text": "A CONSPIRACY OF BONES by Kathy Reichs ‧ RELEASE DATE: March 17, 2020 Forget about solving all these crimes; the signal triumph here is (spoiler) the heroine’s survival. Another sweltering month in Charlotte, another boatload of mysteries past and present for overworked, overstressed forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan. A week after the night she chases but fails to catch a mysterious trespasser outside her town house, some unknown party texts Tempe four images of a corpse that looks as if it’s been chewed by wild hogs, because it has been. Showboat Medical Examiner Margot Heavner makes it clear that, breaking with her department’s earlier practice (The Bone Collection, 2016, etc.), she has no intention of calling in Tempe as a consultant and promptly identifies the faceless body herself as that of a young Asian man. Nettled by several errors in Heavner’s analysis, and even more by her willingness to share the gory details at a press conference, Tempe launches her own investigation, which is not so much off the books as against the books. Heavner isn’t exactly mollified when Tempe, aided by retired police detective Skinny Slidell and a host of experts, puts a name to the dead man. But the hints of other crimes Tempe’s identification uncovers, particularly crimes against children, spur her on to redouble her efforts despite the new M.E.’s splenetic outbursts. Before he died, it seems, Felix Vodyanov was linked to a passenger ferry that sank in 1994, an even earlier U.S. government project to research biological agents that could control human behavior, the hinky spiritual retreat Sparkling Waters, the dark web site DeepUnder, and the disappearances of at least four schoolchildren, two of whom have also turned up dead. And why on earth was Vodyanov carrying Tempe’s own contact information? The mounting evidence of ever more and ever worse skulduggery will pull Tempe deeper and deeper down what even she sees as a rabbit hole before she confronts a ringleader implicated in “Drugs. Fraud. Breaking and entering. Arson. Kidnapping. How does attempted murder sound?” Forget about solving all these crimes; the signal triumph here is (spoiler) the heroine’s survival.
