  "description": "In “The Contagion,” the Dreiyer family’s annual road trip includes a stop at a bed-and-breakfast—that’s where 7-year-old Sylvia peeks into a trunk of dolls, one of which, she swears, moves on its own. Decades later, when looking for inspiration for a TV show she’s working on, she returns to the inn and makes a startling discovery. Von Hessen’s 14 stories herein tackle such diverse subgenres as the undead, body horror, and something more Lovecraftian (“Spectral Golem”), but there’s a discernible theme of identity that runs throughout the book. Characters interrogate their pasts; the narrator of “The Patent-Master” travels to an island coastal town, where the discovery of their late mother’s former profession is the first of many surprises. In one of the collection’s highlights, “The Obscurantist,” Brooklyn-based Andrei’s lifelong obsession with a girl who once appeared on an obscure variety show ultimately leads him down a dark path. These tales are bleak, forgoing humor and zeroing in on individuals who find themselves in miserable, appalling, or lethal circumstances. A few of the entries dive deep into visceral and grotesque imagery; one that’s sure to turn stomachs is “Roscoe’s Malefic Delights,” which is about a newly opened eatery with only one item on its menu: These “delights” (“reminiscent of blood-drained white worms or skinned, flattened rats’ tails or stringy strips of tripe”) definitely don’t look appetizing, but their appearance may not be their worst attribute. In every chilling moment and unexpected turn, the author’s prose is nothing short of intoxicating—unforgettable passages equate one man with “the human embodiment of a prolonged sigh”; a “sloshing” akin to a “half-empty jar of preserves” describes something that ideally shouldn’t be making that sound.",

  "text": "THE BEST AMERICAN SHORT STORIES 2024 edited by Lauren Groff with Heidi Pitlor ‧ RELEASE DATE: Oct. 22, 2024 All hits and no skips is a tall order, but this strong, solid compilation is well worth a short story lover’s time. Pitlor ushers in her final installment as series editor of this long-running staple showcasing the year in short fiction. Of all the kids at the literary lunch table, the anthology might have it the hardest. Wearing plaid with stripes, unpacking the random items in its lunch box—it’s hard for a cohesive personality to shine through, unlike those cool-kid single-author collections. But if readers are prepared for eclecticism—and since Best American Short Stories was established in 1915, we must be—these 20 stories have something for everyone. Guest edited by Groff, a seven-time Best American author, the collection includes some nods to short story royalty: Jhumpa Lahiri, Lori Ostlund, the late Laurie Colwin, and Jim Shepard are all represented. But as both Pitlor and Groff discuss in their introductions, Groff sent back Pitlor’s initial batch of stories asking for something “rawer, meaner, spikier”—stories with their own “weird logic.” (Groff’s description of this aesthetic preference lands better than her diatribe against the first-person point of view, which precedes 12 of 20 stories in first-person.) In finding weird, spiky stories, Groff leans hard—and often thrillingly—on early-career writers. There is Katherine Damm’s sparkling and funny “The Happiest Day of Your Life,” featuring a young husband freewheeling into drunkenness at a wedding reception for his wife’s ex-boyfriend. In Suzanne Wang’s inventive “Mall of America,” AI narrates a tale of corporate (and all-too-human) woe when an elderly man spends time after hours in the mall’s arcade. Madeline Ffitch’s “Seeing Through Maps” recounts the tense relationship between two neighbors with a complicated history. In Steven Duong’s “Dorchester,” a young writer has a poem go viral after an anti-Asian hate crime. All hits and no skips is a tall order, but this strong, solid compilation is well worth a short story lover’s time.
