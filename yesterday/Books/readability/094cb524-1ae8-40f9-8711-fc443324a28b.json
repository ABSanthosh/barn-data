  "description": "Thanks to farms, homes, and development, the forest is getting smaller and smaller. Animals who used to live in harmony find themselves in a cramped, loud environment. At an emergency meeting, a committee decides that some of the animals will be active during the day, while others will be active at night. The night animals postulate that they were assigned their time slot because they aren’t as beautiful as the others. When a poacher sets traps at night, the nocturnal animals try to warn the others, who ignore their calls and wind up caught in snares, traps, and cages. Despite their treatment, the nocturnal creatures free the others from the traps and are welcomed back during the day. But the night animals decide that they prefer the welcoming peace of the forest after dark and that night is where they want to stay. This story makes an interesting comment on deforestation that is paired with an afterword explaining the topic further. Blank lined pages invite readers to note “Things I Can Do To Take Care of the Forests.” Rosique makes masterful use of color, playing the shadows of the forest and night against the vibrant reds of the diurnal creatures. The animals have realistic features and will be appealing to children. This modern parable makes for an enjoyable story as well as a conversation starter.",

  "text": "DON'T LET THE PIGEON DRIVE THE SLEIGH! by Mo Willems ; illustrated by Mo Willems ‧ RELEASE DATE: Sept. 5, 2023 A stocking stuffer par excellence, just right for dishing up with milk and cookies. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 10 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller Pigeon finds something better to drive than some old bus. This time it’s Santa delivering the fateful titular words, and with a “Ho. Ho. Whoa!” the badgering begins: “C’mon! Where’s your holiday spirit? It would be a Christmas MIRACLE! Don’t you want to be part of a Christmas miracle…?” Pigeon is determined: “I can do Santa stuff!” Like wrapping gifts (though the accompanying illustration shows a rather untidy present), delivering them (the image of Pigeon attempting to get an oversize sack down a chimney will have little ones giggling), and eating plenty of cookies. Alas, as Willems’ legion of young fans will gleefully predict, not even Pigeon’s by-now well-honed persuasive powers (“I CAN BE JOLLY!”) will budge the sleigh’s large and stinky reindeer guardian. “BAH. Also humbug.” In the typically minimalist art, the frustrated feathered one sports a floppily expressive green and red elf hat for this seasonal addition to the series—but then discards it at the end for, uh oh, a pair of bunny ears. What could Pigeon have in mind now? “Egg delivery, anyone?” A stocking stuffer par excellence, just right for dishing up with milk and cookies.
