  "description": "Sixteen-year-old trans boy Dominic is trapped on a boring vacation in tiny Liverpool, Nova Scotia, with his parents. But his summer takes a positive turn when he meets the captivating Sunil, a genderqueer teenager who’s staying in the beachfront cottage next door. The two soon develop a friendship—and maybe something more. Dominic spends the first quarter of the book being bored, and readers can’t blame him. The few conflicts that arise belong almost exclusively to Sunil, and even the climactic scenes feel small. Dominic’s character arc is flat, and any areas for potential growth (such as a comment that his mother isn’t “disabled or anything” due to her multiple sclerosis) don’t pay off. The prose succeeds at being accessible to reluctant readers but is otherwise unremarkable and is dotted with cliched phrases and tediously detailed descriptions. With that said, readers specifically looking for a fluffy romance about transgender teens might find something to appreciate in this story: Dominic and Sunil’s relationship is gentle and charming, and they are easy to root for. The novel also contains a much-needed depiction of teens who both know that they are queer and are still figuring some things out. Dominic is white, and Sunil is biracial, with a white dad and South Asian mom.",

  "text": "THE FIELD GUIDE TO THE NORTH AMERICAN TEENAGER by Ben Philippe ‧ RELEASE DATE: Jan. 8, 2019 Despite some missteps, this will appeal to readers who enjoy a fresh and realistic teen voice. A teenage, not-so-lonely loner endures the wilds of high school in Austin, Texas. Norris Kaplan, the protagonist of Philippe’s debut novel, is a hypersweaty, uber-snarky black, Haitian, French-Canadian pushing to survive life in his new school. His professor mom’s new tenure-track job transplants Norris mid–school year, and his biting wit and sarcasm are exposed through his cataloging of his new world in a field guide–style burn book. He’s greeted in his new life by an assortment of acquaintances, Liam, who is white and struggling with depression; Maddie, a self-sacrificing white cheerleader with a heart of gold; and Aarti, his Indian-American love interest who offers connection. Norris’ ego, fueled by his insecurities, often gets in the way of meaningful character development. The scenes showcasing his emotional growth are too brief and, despite foreshadowing, the climax falls flat because he still gets incredible personal access to people he’s hurt. A scene where Norris is confronted by his mother for getting drunk and belligerent with a white cop is diluted by his refusal or inability to grasp the severity of the situation and the resultant minor consequences. The humor is spot-on, as is the representation of the black diaspora; the opportunity for broader conversations about other topics is there, however, the uneven buildup of detailed, meaningful exchanges and the glibness of Norris’ voice detract. Despite some missteps, this will appeal to readers who enjoy a fresh and realistic teen voice.
