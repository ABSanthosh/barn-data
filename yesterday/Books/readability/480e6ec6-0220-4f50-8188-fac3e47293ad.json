  "text": "26 Mar 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Loved by the Orc (Hidden Hollow Book 4)? Loved by the Orc is set in the magical town of Hidden Hollow (which is actually based on Stockbridge, Massachusetts). I wanted to write about a cozy small town that’s a refuge from the outside world, which is getting scarier and more dysfunctional every day. I want my readers to feel all the cozy vibes and feel safe and comforted when they read about Hidden Hollow. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Scifi, Paranormal and Horror are my favorite genres to read. Scifi Romance and Paranormal Romance are my favorites to write. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Lock Every Door by Riley Sager, Buried Deep by Naomi Novik, The Return, by Rachel Harris (my new favorite author of feminist horror.) What scene in your book was your favorite to write? I love the scene where Tark cradles Harmony in his arms and comforts her. There is a lot of hurt/comfort and sexual healing in this book. The hero is a cinnamon roll–gruff on the outside but sweet and caring to the heroine. I love his nurturing vibe and his protectiveness towards her. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I either write standing up or semi-reclined on my daybed–never sitting all the way up. This isn’t really quirky though–it’s mainly for my back health. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? I don’t want to write anything that could actually happen–that’s reality which is boring. I write for escape into fantastical fictional worlds of wonder. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? The way it made them feel when they finished it. I want my readers to feel happy and comforted after reading my books.
