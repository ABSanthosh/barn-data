  "description": "After a quartet of 4-year-olds built a block tower together at a Drag Queen Story Hour during Provincetown’s Family Week, their parents—an interracial, interfaith (Asian/white and Jewish) lesbian couple, an interracial, interfaith (Black/white and Jewish) gay couple, and a single lesbian mother (presumed white)—all decided to vacation together henceforth. But this Family Week, they’re bringing more emotional baggage than luggage. Milo (who’s academically gifted as well as trans) and his twin sister, Lina, are struggling with Milo’s upcoming departure for a fancy boarding school. Avery is heartbroken over her fathers’ impending divorce and the forthcoming baby sibling (Daddy’s new female partner is pregnant). Meanwhile, Mac, who’s been attending summer school to avoid repeating seventh grade, is just trying to figure out what he’s good at, especially in comparison to the gifted and people-pleasing Milo. With each weekday forming its own chapter, this short book packs in a lot and relies on overwhelmingly long sentences; as a result, the characters, conflicts, and emotions end up feeling rushed and underexplored. The breathless pace also means that each family feels more like a rough sketch rather than fully fleshed-out individuals. Milo and Lina are biracial (Asian and white), Avery’s biracial (Black and white), and Mac presents white.",

  "text": "BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE by Kate DiCamillo ‧ RELEASE DATE: March 1, 2000 A real gem. Awards \u0026 Accolades Our Verdict GET IT Newbery Honor Book A 10-year old girl learns to adjust to a strange town, makes some fascinating friends, and fills the empty space in her heart thanks to a big old stray dog in this lyrical, moving, and enchanting book by a fresh new voice.  India Opal’s mama left when she was only three, and her father, “the preacher,” is absorbed in his own loss and in the work of his new ministry at the Open-Arms Baptist Church of Naomi [Florida]. Enter Winn-Dixie, a dog who “looked like a big piece of old brown carpet that had been left out in the rain.” But, this dog had a grin “so big that it made him sneeze.” And, as Opal says, “It’s hard not to immediately fall in love with a dog who has a good sense of humor.” Because of Winn-Dixie, Opal meets Miss Franny Block, an elderly lady whose papa built her a library of her own when she was just a little girl and she’s been the librarian ever since. Then, there’s nearly blind Gloria Dump, who hangs the empty bottle wreckage of her past from the mistake tree in her back yard. And, Otis, oh yes, Otis, whose music charms the gerbils, rabbits, snakes and lizards he’s let out of their cages in the pet store. Brush strokes of magical realism elevate this beyond a simple story of friendship to a well-crafted tale of community and fellowship, of sweetness, sorrow and hope. And, it’s funny, too. A real gem.
