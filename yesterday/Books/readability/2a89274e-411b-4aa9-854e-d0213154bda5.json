  "text": "27 Nov 2024 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Light Locked (Light Locked Series Book 1)? Light Locked is the mature re-write of a story that I started ages ago. The very, very first version was actually when I was 12. It was printed in dramatic 16 pt font with a cover made out of duct tape and repurposed cardboard from a chocolate box. Bringing the story to life with real imagery and themes has been such an adventure because I think some of the stories we write when we’re young are very authentic and such a real reflection of what we were feeling and thinking, without other people influencing our opinions about what writing should be like. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Fantasy with a strong romantic undertone. I love slow burn romance development between characters but it’s really important for there to also be a strong plot to back the story. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Someone recently recommended Villains and Virtues to me by A.K. Caggiano (just realized her title also starts with A.K.!) and I’d like to check it out. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? So many scenes were a favorite of mine at one point or another, but a lot of the writing builds toward what I refer to as “the castle scene”. I can’t share anything else because of spoilers! Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) Good question! If I am writing it’s nice to have hot tea and candle nearby. If I’m editing, it’s fun to have The Office, Parks and Rec, or another light, funny show in the background. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? “You only really have what you’re grateful for.” If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? I guess anything meaningful they took from the book. The characters and themes were so powerful in helping me work through my own struggles and questions about the world. I hope it brings other people similar comfort. Buy The Book Sign up for our email and we’ll send you the best new books in your favorite genres weekly. meghan Recommended Posts",
