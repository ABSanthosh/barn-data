  "description": "Thirty years ago, Dani Duprie, having spotted an unknown woman giving her the once-over, persuaded her husband, Bill, to pack up their 10-year-old daughter and pull up stakes yet again for an undisclosed but very urgent reason. The mysterious circumstances of their departure from the Cliff House still have the locals buzzing, but the buzz hasn’t reached Serena Winters, the well-known author of 11 Layne Farraday mysteries, until after she’s settled in the Cliff House. “Settled” may not be the best word, since she’s greeted by a series of anonymous messages beginning with “LEAVE TOWN NOW” and then escalating in their threats. When housekeeper Wanda Stockwell accuses her of moving to Cliff House in order to exploit the Dupries’ disappearance, Serena takes this as a karmic invitation to dive into the case with Seaton Point police Chief Jack Beaumont, who’s at least equally interested in her. All the while, Gray’s been shuttling repeatedly into the past to follow the fortunes of bad-girl Ruby Bryant, tossed out of her old home back in 1983 because she refused to accept her mother’s latest lover, who seemed to have an eye on her as well. Eventually the two narratives come together in a way that will surprise only newcomers to the genre. In fact, the biggest limitation in this propulsive mystery is a distinct lack of mystery. It’s nice to report, however, that Serena’s latest opus gets well underway.",

  "text": "NONE OF THIS IS TRUE by Lisa Jewell ‧ RELEASE DATE: Aug. 8, 2023 It's hard to read but hard to look away from. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 25 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller When two women who share a birthday meet, a journalist becomes the subject of her own true-crime mystery. On their 45th birthdays, Josie Fair and Alix Summer meet at a pub and discover they were born not only on the same day, but in the same hospital. Alix is a successful journalist, and Josie convinces Alix that her story is worth telling: Josie met her husband when she was 13 and he was 40. “I can see that maybe I was being used, that maybe I was even being groomed?” she confesses to Alix. “But that feeling of being powerful, right at the start, when I was still in control. I miss that sometimes. I really do. And what I’d like, more than anything, is to get it back.” From this premise Alix creates a Netflix series, Hi! I’m Your Birthday Twin! which investigates Josie’s life as she reconciles what happened to her as a teen and seeks a new path. With the story unfinished, the narrative unfolds in the present tense, with prose that jingles like song lyrics: “He turns to see if the girl is behind him, and sees her wishy-washy, wavy-wavy, in double vision through the glass windows of the hotel.” Alix is both intrigued and repulsed by Josie, but she initially gives her the benefit of the doubt. After all, Alix’s husband, Nathan, has a drinking problem, and Alix knows what it’s like to be reluctant to leave a bad situation. But Josie seems more interested in being part of Alix’s seemingly glamorous life than she is in fixing her own, and when three people end up dead and Alix’s life is turned upside down, the evidence points to Josie—and turns the TV series into a murder mystery. Transcripts from Alix’s interviews alternate with the narrative, offering increasingly varied perspectives on Josie’s story as told by her neighbors, friends, and family members. With so many versions of events, the ending shatters, leaving readers to decide whose is the truth. It's hard to read but hard to look away from.
