  "text": "06 Feb 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write The Embers: The Bobby Tomlinson Story? The story of The Embers is deeply rooted in the heart of Carolina Beach Music, a genre that has brought people together through rhythm and dance for nearly eight decades. When I joined this project as a co-author, Bill Benners and Skip Crayton had already been working on it since 2010 and had gathered a wealth of material. It was an incredible team effort. I had known The Embers from my college days, but as I dug deeper into Bobby Tomlinson’s journey—his role as a drummer, bandleader, and visionary—I realized just how much of a cultural force the band had been. Their story needed to be told. The book traces their six-decade history, from humble beginnings in the late 1950s to their rise as one of the defining bands of Carolina Beach Music. But it’s more than just a band history—it’s Bobby Tomlinson’s personal journey. As the group’s organizer, manager, and drummer, Bobby shares his insights and reflections on a lifetime in music. What made The Embers unique wasn’t just their sound—it was their entire presence: their signature harmonies, dynamic floor shows, and sharp stage attire. They built a legacy beyond the music itself, running six Embers Clubs across the Carolinas, writing an original song that became a classic, securing a decade-long partnership with Budweiser to record commercials and headline national gatherings, and dedicating themselves to the evolution and success of Carolina Beach Music. Through Bobby’s eyes, along with the voices of over a dozen former and current bandmates, we set out to capture the passion, perseverance, and power of music—and how The Embers became legends in the Southern music scene. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of The Embers: The Bobby Tomlinson Story, what would they be? Bobby Tomlinson: “Eye of the Tiger” by Survivor – an anthem of resilience and perseverance. Jackie Gore: “I Love Beach Music” by The Embers – the song that became the band’s signature and a defining piece of the genre. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I love historical nonfiction, especially books that explore music and Southern culture. It aligns closely with what I enjoy writing—stories that preserve history and bring a moment in time to life. What books are on your TBR pile right now? How ‘Bout The Dawgs!: The Inside Story of Georgia Football’s 2021 National Championship Season by Kirby Smart \u0026 Loran Smith. The New 50th Anniversary Edition of Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live by Doug Hill \u0026 Jeff Weingrad. Carolina Beach Music: Compilation Albums by Dr. Rick Simmons. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? 1. The making of “I Love Beach Music” (1978–early 1980s): This was the defining song of The Embers’ career, and capturing how it came together—along with its impact on the Southern beach music scene—was incredibly rewarding. The song inspired a national beer distributor’s advertising campaign and led to an incredible sponsorship for the band. 2. The band’s one-day trip to TJ Lubinsky’s “home” studio in Pittsburgh: The Embers recorded a couple of tracks for a summer music TV special and CD, and Bobby’s firsthand account of the experience, the setting, and the whirlwind nature of the trip was both fascinating and memorable. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I’m at my best with a cup of coffee nearby. And when working on The Embers book, I often played their music in the background—it helped bring me into their world. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? “Music is the universal language of mankind.” – Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. This quote speaks to the unifying power of music, which is a central theme in my writing. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? The enduring impact of music as a source of joy, connection, and cultural identity—and how The Embers helped shape the beach music genre.
