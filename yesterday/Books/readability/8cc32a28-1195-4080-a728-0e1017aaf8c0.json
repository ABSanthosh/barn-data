  "description": "Alex, a Secwépemc First Nations PI, formerly with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, is called in to investigate the attempted murder of Max King, a lawyer involved in bringing suits against mining interests, and Max’s girlfriend, Rose Barlow. Max and Alex are both members of the redz, a secret network of Indigenous people who are helping to coordinate “White Paper Blizzard,” an international, coordinated attempt to bring lawsuits against companies whose ecological degradation is jeopardizing individuals’ “right to a healthy environment.” At the outset, Max’s assailants dump him near the entrance of one of the rare earthmines his group is targeting. His mother calls on Alex to investigate, and the private eye, along with a former Mountie colleague, a couple of local detectives, and the redz work together to unravel a complex situation that involves an organized crime ring, competing corporations, and others who would have a lot to lose from mine closures. Over the course of the novel, Van Clieaf spins a plot that’s ambitious and engaging, even if it sometimes stretches the limits of credibility. The writing style is sometimes a bit flat or clinical, which makes it hard for readers to get a grasp on some of the secondary characters. A few, however, such as mob goon Frank McGiver, are vivid, over-the-top characters that genre fans are likely to recognize and appreciate. The story also addresses the processes of rare earth mining with clarity, and it’s at its strongest when it explores the nuances of complex social and political issues.",

  "text": "ROBERT B. PARKER'S BURIED SECRETS by Christopher Farnsworth ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 4, 2025 So, Paradise isn’t paradise, and the Parker legacy lives on. Parker’s Jesse Stone series continues with more trouble in Paradise, Massachusetts. Police Chief Jesse Stone does a welfare check at the urging of a local citizen named Matthew Peebles and discovers a dead body in a room piled high with trash and old Polaroids depicting murder victims, either garroted or shot in the head. Who werethese victims? Chief Stone improbably keeps the investigation local—no need to complicate the story with the state police or the FBI—and that helps maintain the small-town flavor of this entertaining tale. Stone hires a new cop, Derek Tate, for his understaffed department. But to put it mildly, Tate is a poor fit. Boss and newcomer have radically different concepts of policing: Stone sees himself as a servant of his community, while Tate only wants to catch criminals and crack heads. At one point, Stone asks him what he did on his shift: “Did you give a tourist directions? Did you help an old lady cross the street or get a little girl’s cat out of a tree? Anything at all like that?” Tate replies “That’s not what real cops do,” and proceeds to alienate “beloved institutional figure” Daisy, cafe owner and longtime provider of donuts and muffins to Paradise’s finest. Indeed, Tate could be a model fascist, and Stone’s biggest mistake is not firing him. Meanwhile, Peebles fears for his life because of his “aging mobster” great uncle, who just might have something to do with all those murders. If Peebles says anything to the cops, he knows he’s a dead man. Hell, he’s probably doomed anyway. Stone is a stand-up cop who puts his life on the line for the town he loves, and his dealings with friends and colleagues are fun to witness: “I’m the chief. I’m supposed to tell you what to do,” he tells Molly Crane, his deputy chief. “It’s adorable that you think that,” she replies. And when all Paradise cops are banned from Daisy’s cafe because of Tate’s stupidity, Stone navigates treacherous territory while showing respect. This is Farnsworth’s first entry in the series created by Robert Parker, and fans will be pleased. So, Paradise isn’t paradise, and the Parker legacy lives on.
