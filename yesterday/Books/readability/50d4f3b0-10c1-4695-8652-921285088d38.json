  "description": "For decades, biographers have focused on Martin Luther King Jr.’s successful leadership in the South while suggesting that his Northern activism failed because it lacked direction and local support. Theoharis, a professor of political science at Brooklyn College, upends this narrative by painstakingly documenting King’s relentless and impassioned battles against Northern discrimination and police brutality, an effort that had its origins in his experiences as a graduate student in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Author of The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks (2013), Theoharis also presents a fully developed picture of Coretta Scott King’s activism, both in tandem and apart from her husband, whom she met as a student in Boston. Neither of the Kings forgot the racism they encountered as students in the North, and they worked with local organizers to address it throughout their lives. Yet time and time again the same white Northern politicians who praised King’s civil rights work in the South either fell silent or became combative when King turned his attention to the systemic racism of the North. Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley did everything in his power to stop civil rights progress in the city and defended his white neighbors who “threw rocks, eggs, and firecrackers” at civil rights marchers as “fine people, hard-working people.” The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, and other mainstream news outlets often ignored or actively refuted King’s accusations of Northern racism, creating a documentary history that has shaped King’s legacy ever since. By looking beyond these sources, Theoharis depicts a complex, radical King whose fight against Northern racism alternately inspires and infuriates.",

  "text": "ONE DAY, EVERYONE WILL HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AGAINST THIS by Omar El Akkad ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 25, 2025 A philosophically rich critique of state violence and mass apathy. An Egyptian Canadian journalist writes searchingly of this time of war. “Rules, conventions, morals, reality itself: all exist so long as their existence is convenient to the preservation of power.” So writes El Akkad, who goes on to state that one of the demands of modern power is that those subject to it must imagine that some group of people somewhere are not fully human. El Akkad’s pointed example is Gaza, the current destruction of which, he writes, is causing millions of people around the world to examine the supposedly rules-governed, democratic West and declare, “I want nothing to do with this.” El Akkad, author of the novel American War (2017), discerns hypocrisy and racism in the West’s defense of Ukraine and what he views as indifference toward the Palestinian people. No stranger to war zones himself—El Akkad was a correspondent in Afghanistan and Iraq—he writes with grim matter-of-factness about murdered children, famine, and the deliberate targeting of civilians. With no love for Zionism lost, he offers an equally harsh critique of Hamas, yet another one of the “entities obsessed with violence as an ethos, brutal in their treatment of minority groups who in their view should not exist, and self-decreed to be the true protectors of an entire religion.” Taking a global view, El Akkad, who lives in the U.S., finds almost every government and society wanting, and not least those, he says, that turn away and pretend not to know, behavior that we’ve seen before and that, in the spirit of his title, will one day be explained away until, in the end, it comes down to “a quiet unheard reckoning in the winter of life between the one who said nothing, did nothing, and their own soul.” A philosophically rich critique of state violence and mass apathy.
