  "description": "Newly 15-year-old Cat really wants her new girlfriend, Morgan, to get along with her friends, but they’re just not gelling. English Cat is part of the fashion-conscious, makeup-wearing group surrounding her school’s queen bee, Siobhan, while Irish Morgan hangs with an edgier, goth-leaning cohort. To make matters worse, Morgan and Siobhan are both running for head girl. The competition gets fierce, and to avoid favoring one person over the other, Cat auditions for the school play, Romeo and Juliet—and lands the lead! Now she’ll be too busy to help out with any campaigns. Meanwhile, Cat’s best friend, the Polish Zanna, is acting weird—it seems like she doesn’t want to listen to Cat’s many woes. What’s up with that? This sequel to 2023’s Never Trust a Gemini, which traverses the zodiac calendar from the self-focused Aquarius to the grounded Taurus, allows for solid character development while still delivering plenty of farcical rom-com antics. Cat and Morgan’s relationship remains strong, despite various elements attempting to foil them, which is sweet and refreshing. Cat’s narration (and much of the dialogue) is still chock-full of slang as well as her own hilarious coinages (she’s fond of invoking Aphrodite and exclaiming “gooseberries!”), and her chatty style will draw readers in. Woolf’s sophomore novel firmly establishes her as a young adult author to watch.",

  "text": "THE GIRL OF FIRE AND THORNS From the Girl of Fire and Thorns series , Vol. 1 by Rae Carson ‧ RELEASE DATE: Sept. 1, 2011 Despite the stale fat-to-curvy pattern, compelling world building with a Southern European, pseudo-Christian feel,... Adventure drags our heroine all over the map of fantasyland while giving her the opportunity to use her smarts. Elisa—Princess Lucero-Elisa de Riqueza of Orovalle—has been chosen for Service since the day she was born, when a beam of holy light put a Godstone in her navel. She's a devout reader of holy books and is well-versed in the military strategy text Belleza Guerra, but she has been kept in ignorance of world affairs. With no warning, this fat, self-loathing princess is married off to a distant king and is embroiled in political and spiritual intrigue. War is coming, and perhaps only Elisa's Godstone—and knowledge from the Belleza Guerra—can save them. Elisa uses her untried strategic knowledge to always-good effect. With a character so smart that she doesn't have much to learn, body size is stereotypically substituted for character development. Elisa’s \"mountainous\" body shrivels away when she spends a month on forced march eating rat, and thus she is a better person. Still, it's wonderfully refreshing to see a heroine using her brain to win a war rather than strapping on a sword and charging into battle. Despite the stale fat-to-curvy pattern, compelling world building with a Southern European, pseudo-Christian feel, reminiscent of Naomi Kritzer's Fires of the Faithful (2002), keeps this entry fresh.
