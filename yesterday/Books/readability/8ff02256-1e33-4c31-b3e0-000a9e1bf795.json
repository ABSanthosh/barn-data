View All posts by Community The International Booker Prize is the world’s most influential literary award for translated fiction, with its £50,000 prize money that gets divided equally between authors and translators. It got its start as the Man Booker Internationl Prize in 2005, and looks at the best novels and short story collections that have been translated into English and published in the UK or Ireland. This year, the judges chose Heart Lamp by Banu Mushtaq as the year’s best translated work. The win marks the first time the award has been granted to a short story collection. The collection itself looks at the daily lives of women and girls in Muslim communities in southern India. For more on the winner of the prize, visit the Booker Prize site. There is an interview with the author, a reading guide, a reading, and more. Find more news and stories of interest from the book world in Breaking in Books.",
