  "description": "Lord Jonathan Leighton, third son of the Duke of Falconridge, was on a grand tour when he and thousands of other British civilians were forced into detainee camps in France. Jon attempted escape alongside his two best friends and his mentor, Dr. Isaac Morris, but they were captured and sent to prison, where Morris died before they were released. When, after 11 years away, Jon returns to England with plans to make good on his promise to find a husband for his mentor’s daughter, Victoria, he learns that his father and two brothers are dead and he’s inherited the dukedom; Tory now works as his sister’s governess. When he (falsely) tells Tory that her father left her a sizable dowry—providing the money himself seems like the best way to help her—she surprises him by responding that she does not wish to marry but would rather open a school for women artists like herself. They come to an agreement that Tory will be presented in Society and look for a husband until the end of the Season if Jon will attend sculpting lessons, but they soon find themselves unable to resist their mutual attraction. Both are hiding secrets, though, which become more complicated to maintain as their feelings grow. This new series kickoff hits all the notes of an old-school romance, with historical richness, delicious pining, and a lack of communication and trust keeping the pair apart. Secondary characters function as plot devices, but the leads are appealing. There are short references to atrocities Jon and others faced while in France, but the story never goes too deep, maintaining a light tone instead. One mystery thread is left open for future books.",

  "text": "DEEP END by Ali Hazelwood ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 4, 2025 A surprisingly sensual sports romance. A collegiate diver and swimmer secretly pursue kink together, and risk falling in love along the way. Scarlett Vandermeer is struggling. Despite a successful recovery from the injury that almost ended her Stanford diving career, she hasn’t been able to get her head together, and it’s affecting her performance. Plus, she’s trying to stay focused on getting into medical school. A relationship would be out of the question. By comparison, Lukas Blomqvist is a swimming idol, a record-breaker who wins medals as easily as breathing, and Scarlett has long been convinced he would never look in her direction—until one fateful night when a mutual friend lets slip that they have something unexpected in common: Scarlett likes to be submissive in the bedroom, while Lukas prefers to take a dominant approach. Now, they both know a big secret about each other, and it’s something neither of them can stop thinking about. It’s Lukas who suggests they have a fling—purely physical, just to take the edge off, so Scarlett can get out of her own head and stop overthinking her dives. Initially, their arrangement is easy to stick to, but the more time they spend together, the more Scarlett starts to realize that what she feels for Lukas is more than physical attraction. Complicating the situation is the fact that Scarlett’s friend Penelope Ross used to go out with Lukas, and the longer Scarlett keeps mum about her true feelings for him, the more difficult it is to keep the situation hidden from another person she really cares about. While Scarlett and Lukas’ relationship does begin as a physical one, their deeper psychological connection takes a little too long to emerge amid all the other storylines, resulting in a somewhat rushed resolution. However, Hazelwood’s latest is proof of the depth and maturity that has emerged in her writing over the years, and it highlights her embrace of sexier, more emotional elements than were present in her original STEMinist rom-coms.
