  "text": "Welcome to Today in Books, our daily round-up of literary headlines at the intersection of politics, culture, media, and more. The Most Interesting AI-Generated Story Yet Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, touted a story “written” by their LLM is response to the prompt: “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” The resulting story is, I think it is fair to say, the most interesting “creative writing” product I have seen, and not because it is necessarily good, but because it is interestingly messy, plausible, and not without some virtues. Lincoln Michel goes sentence-level deep here,and I found myself nodding along to most of his analysis. For my part, it fall into a literary uncanny valley, neither bad enough to be laughable nor good enough to be “lifelike.” The strangeness of it is then all the more compelling and disturbing. The 2025 National Book Critics Circle Award Winners Announced The big story is that James did not in fact win in the fiction category. The winner, which I have not read so I will withold any “but whyyyyyy” reactions, is My Friends by Hisham Matar. It is been in and around several awards so I wouldn’t say it is a surprise necessarily. No wait, I think it actually kind of is. Challenger winning in Nonfiction and There’s Always This Year in Criticism (still a puzzle why it is there) are terrific outcomes. Full list of winners, including Best First Book and Translation, listed here. AI search engines cite incorrect news sources at an alarming 60% rate, study says This study by the Columbia Journalism Review finds that AI search engines not only get it wrong most of the time (to the tune of 60% of the time), they are also pretty confident in the answers they give that turn out to be wrong. This largely matches my own experience using LLMs for search-related things: you just cannot trust it. Now, how wrong are the answers people finding using more traditional search engines is an interesting question I don’t know the answer to, but this study suggests that even regular Google results are worse than they used to be. Not great. Looking Inside the Slush Pile I don’t want to spoil ANY of the data points in Laura McGrath’s…let’s call it sobering analysis of the very, very long odds of being discovered off the slush pile. I was expecting the chances of being dodgy, but by eyebrows were not ready for the sudden elevation change that happened several times here. McGrath’s newsletter, TextCrunch is right in the zone for readers of this newsletter, and I suggest subscribing forthwith.",
