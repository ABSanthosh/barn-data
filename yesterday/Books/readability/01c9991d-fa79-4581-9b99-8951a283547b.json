The fantasy genre is bursting with new novels that weave together folklore, humor, and heart in ways that feel just as captivating. These fresh tales of gods, tricksters, and hidden magic will transport you to worlds as vibrant and compelling as Gaiman’s. Ready to spin a new web of adventure? Let’s dive in! Way of the Wolf (Magnetic Magic Book 1) by Lindsay Buroker Release Date: January 3 2025 Divorcee. Empty nester. Werewolf. A snarky 40-something property manager, Luna is used to dealing with late rent, clogged toilets, and melodramatic tenants. But quirky werewolves, mysterious artifacts, estranged relatives, and attempts on her life? Even she may not have the experience to handle all that. Buy on Amazon Threshold: Stories from Cradle by Will Wight Release Date: January 7 2025 Lindon’s journey may have ended, but there are still more tales to tell. The stories in this collection will show you the world after Cradle, those left behind, and even some legends from long ago. If you’ve read the main series but you still want more, these are for you. Buy on Amazon Four Ruined Realms (The Broken Blades Book 2) by Mai Corland Release Date: January 7 2025 A foreign rule of law stands between them and Quilimar, the Queen of Khitan. Now they have one month to steal the powerful Golden Ring of the Dragon Lord. But that impossible task might be easier than trusting one another, even though their lives, their families, and the realms depend on it. Buy on Amazon Visions of Darkness by A.L. Jackson Release Date: January 7 2025 Aria’s hallucinations are seeping into her waking world. And the Kruen are coming for her. To help Aria, Pax must do what no one in Faydor has dared to do before—join his soulmate in the light of day. Giving in to their forbidden attraction could be the death of them, but they might not be able to stop themselves as they embark on a cross-country journey to fight the evils hunting them. Buy on Amazon Codename: Deathwish (Spellbound Security Book 3) by TR Cameron Release Date: January 7 2025 A new client fell out of the sky. Action Movie Star, Hayley Wish’s plane decided to take a nosedive with her inside. Quick thinking and a jarring ejection saved that pretty face. Danica is there to ponder who, why and just how did they do that? Is it magic? It will take all of the team’s skills and abilities to figure it out. Moriarity has turned his attention to Danica Grey and Jilly the Fae Dragon. Can they survive the probe? Buy on Amazon White Little Lies (Four Ways to Fate Book 3) by Sara C. Roethle Release Date: December 27 2024 Regardless of those fears, we’ll have to test those bonds when finding a poisoned nymph pulls us right into a fresh mystery. Who would ever want to harm a young innocent girl, and what exactly does it have to do with the mystery surrounding my mother? Buy on Amazon meghan Recommended Posts",
