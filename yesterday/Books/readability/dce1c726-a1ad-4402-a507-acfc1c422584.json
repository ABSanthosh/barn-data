Zainab Williams Welcome to Today in Books, our daily round-up of literary headlines at the intersection of politics, culture, media, and more. 24 New York Times-Recommended Fiction Books for Spring Spring is right around the corner! Time to make some decisions about which books you’re going to take outside while you breathe in that fresh, verdant air. If you need an assist with your seasonal TBR, The Times has a list of 24 novels to look forward to. Suzanne Collins’ The Hunger Games prequel, Sunrise on the Reaping, is bound to be a bestseller, I’m looking forward to reading Tilt by Emma Pattee (full disclosure, I know her, but as you can see I’m not the only one excited about this book), The Buffalo Hunter Hunter by Stephen Graham Jones is also on this horror fan’s list, as are Ocean Vuong’s much-anticipated The Emperor of Gladness, and Flirting Lessons by Jasmine Guillory. This list is a great reminder that we’re set up for a sensational season of reading. We Need Diverse Books Inaugural Reading Day! Well this is the fun and uplifting news I needed at the end of an exhausting week. The esteemed and hardworking team over at We Need Diverse Books is organizing a day to celebrate diverse books and reading. Readers are encouraged to pick up books by people from marginalized communities on April 3rd. As many voices from the WNDB team, including Dhonielle Clayton (Blackout) and Roxane Gay (Bad Feminist), message, it’s important to make sure diverse books are on those shelves because everyone stands to benefit from reading books that represent the underrepresented. WNDB will be posting resources on how to find diverse books and will provide a diverse book to an underresourced school for every $10 donated. Schools and readers could use all the help they can get these days. Check out this article for more information on why diverse books are important and how you can participate.

This Spicy Meta Tell-All Book Just Got Spicier Yes, Meta won an emergency arbitration ruling against a former employee to stop her from promoting her tell-all book exposing some ugly inner workings of the social media company, but when I picture winning, this is not what I see. Early reviews of Sarah Wynn-Williams’ Careless People have made it very clear that this is a no-holds-barred kind of exposé with Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and other current and former heads of the social media company coming out fully scathed. The thing about this ruling is that it does not appear to prevent the book’s publisher, Macmillan, from moving forward with publication and promotion. And I don’t know about you, but I’m even more curious about what’s on these pages than I was a moment ago. One has to laugh reading this statement posted by a Meta spokesperson to Threads, “This ruling affirms that Sarah Wynn Williams’ false and defamatory book should never have been published.” Like, who is that even written for? The Most Read Books on Goodreads There’s a new top-five title in town! The Empyrean series is holding fast at the head of the most-read books on Goodreads, but an Elsie Silver romance has made the list this week. You can also find a couple of new release highlights, including a book about a unified society of humans and robots, and one that “questions how technology, privacy, and freedom can coexist.” The comments section is moderated according to our community guidelines.
