View All posts by Erica Ezeifedi Haymarket recently had a sale on poetry books in celebration of National Poetry Month that coincided with a sale on a few of their other titles. Book sales are like catnip to me, so I got a book that had been on my list since forever, a collection by an author I’ve been meaning to read for a while now, and a totally new-to-me collection and poet. Before I get to the books, let me tell you about Haymarket real quick. It’s “a radical, independent, nonprofit book publisher based in Chicago” with the goal of aiding the fight for social and economic justice through books. If you’re curious about some of their offerings, continue below for the legacy of a history-making Black feminist group from the ’70s, a poetic look at the 1919 Chicago Race Riot, and verses around a Palestinian American poet’s layered identities. The book that has been on my list since forever How We Get Free by Keeanga-Yamahtta TaylorThis 2018 Lambda Award-winning book looks at the legacy and contributions of the founding members of the  Combahee River Collective, a ground-breaking group of radical Black feminists that formed during the revoluntionary ’70s. Here, interviews and essays with and by the founding members of the group reflect on Black feminism. A collection by an author I’ve been meaning to read for a while now 1919 by Eve L. EwingUsing poetry and afrofuturist lenses, Ewing explores the largely unknown Chicago Race Riot of 1919—also known as the Red Summer—which resulted in 38 deaths, 500 injuries, and lasted eight days. A totally new-to-me collection and poet DEAR GOD. DEAR BONES. DEAR YELLOW. by Noor HindiPalestinian American poet Noor Hindi layers the various aspects of her identity, examines them, and explores how colonialism, patriarchy, religion, and all other aspects of society interact with them. **All-Access subscribers continue below for 11 BIPOC books out this week** The comments section is moderated according to our community guidelines.
