  "text": "A previous send of this newsletter had the incorrect link! The survey link is correct now. In just a couple of week, we’ll be halfway through 2025, which means we’re halfway through the 2025 Read Harder Challenge! Can you believe it? I thought this was a great time to check in: how much progress have you made so far? Which tasks are giving you trouble? What’s your favorite book you’ve read for the challenge so far? I’ve put these questions together in a Google form, and in two weeks, I’ll share my findings! Click through to take the survey! I can’t wait to hear what you all say, and I’m sure I’ll end up with a ton more books on my TBR. I’ll close the survey to responses in one week (June 23rd), and then I’ll crunch all that data and share my findings with you.
