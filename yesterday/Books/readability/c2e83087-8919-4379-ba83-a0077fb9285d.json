It’s finally spring here in the northern hemisphere, and I’m already thinking about summer books. I keep a running list of upcoming queer book releases I’m excited about, which means I’m always living a few months in the future, at least in terms of my TBR. So, I thought I’d share five of the queer books out this summer I’m most looking forward to. Publishing has a funny way of defining seasons, but I’m counting books out from June to August. It includes an F/F multiverse love story, a trans satire about volleyball players, toxic lesbian vampires, a dystopian graphic novel with a trans guy main character, and a bi4bi genderqueer apocalyptic YA thriller.
