  "description": "Issey is an enthusiastic burglar living in an attic apartment in present-day Boston. He’s part of a collective of crooks who rob and fence delicate valuables, priceless heirlooms, and other items from the ritzy neighborhoods and campuses of Boston and Cambridge. Unfortunately for Issey, the group has had enough of him bringing only knickknacks of minor value to the table, and they’re set to kick him out before their mysterious, large-scale “Faneuil Hall job.” Issey pleads for one more chance, but then he receives a call from his brother, to whom he hasn’t spoken in years; he informs him that their mother has remarried and moved away. Issey agrees to return home to Vermont to clear out her collection of fancy vases—which he’d stolen from others. Once there, he meets Rohel’s sharp-tongued wife, Anissa, and finds out that his brother wants to sell their mom’s house. Issey continues his thieving ways in Vermont, and before long, he’s accused of stealing three horses from a local named Avi; he didsteal many things from Avi, but not his horses. His search for the animals strangely makes him a local hero. However, as in other good books about crooks, an associate from Issey’s past lurks in the shadows. Many novels about thieves promise humor, but Grosvenor’s is a rare one that actually delivers: “Issey was getting beaten up a lot these days. More than usual. Was he just terrible at this now?” Readers will easily relate to Issey and the mismatch of his ambitions and abilities—as well as conviction that looking the part of the erudite thief is almost as important as what he steals. The settings, too, are well-rendered, especially when the narrative shifts to Vermont: “The air has a purity that cuts through scavengers and liars.” Overall, it’s a satisfying read, featuring a reluctant hero who’s sure to keep readers chuckling.",

  "text": "WE ALL LIVE HERE by Jojo Moyes ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 11, 2025 A moving, realistic look at one woman’s post-divorce family life that manages to be both poignant and funny. A recently divorced writer juggles a chaotic full house, a struggling career, and a confusing romantic life. Lila Kennedy thought she had the perfect family—a loving mother, a doting stepfather, two wonderful daughters, and a great husband. She even wrote a self-help book about repairing a marriage, which was published a mere two weeks before her husband left her. After her own mother’s sudden death, Lila finds herself an unexpected single mom with her health-nut stepfather, Bill, for a roommate. When her long-absent actor father, Gene, moves in, things go from crowded to chaotic. When Gene isn’t talking about his memories of starring on a Star Trek–like television show, he’s starting fights with Bill. Perhaps the worst part is that Lila’s supposed to produce a new book about the unexpected direction her life has taken. She quickly finds that writing about her real-life romantic exploits (including the kind gardener Bill hired and the sexy single dad she lusts after at school pick-up) and the actual heartbreak that upended her family is easier said than done. Moyes creates a world that is believable and funny. It’s hilarious to read about the distinct characters in Lila’s life—such as her lentil-loving stepfather and egocentric biological father—interacting with each other. There’s plenty of drama here, but none of it feels forced. It all comes from flawed people doing their best to coexist and making plenty of mistakes along the way. Moyes combines the warmth of an Annabel Monaghan rom-com with the humanity of a Catherine Newman novel, creating a story that will provoke tears and laughter. A moving, realistic look at one woman’s post-divorce family life that manages to be both poignant and funny.
