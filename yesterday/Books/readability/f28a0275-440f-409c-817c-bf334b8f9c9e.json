  "text": "11 Jul 2025 The Future Isn’t Ready for You: Must-Read Fantasy \u0026 Sci-Fi Books The future is closer than you think. These sci-fi reads explore genetic breakthroughs, rogue AI, and fractured societies on the edge of collapse. Smart, intense, and deeply human, they’ll leave you questioning what’s next. Augury of Blood (Legacy of Urmanghor Book 1) by Michael R. Schultheiss Release Date: July 5, 2025 Wandering gods and forces of darkness vie for control. Their plots entangle the destinies of a warrior defending his tribe, a king’s daughter with a terrible secret, and a great lord desperate to protect his son. As armies march to war, men and women in disparate lands must navigate the schemes of gods, Titans, and shape-shifting Dweyari if they hope to survive… Buy on Amazon DeWulf’s Twins by Ulysses Namon Release Date: July 8, 2025 Identical twin sisters Logan and Alex DeWulf were looking for an escape from the tedium of their modeling career when they got more than they bargained for when they were abducted and taken into space. Being taken on such an adventure is only the beginning. Now that they have been taken away from the life they know, how do they get back? Buy on Amazon Pim’s Peculiar Passion (Hand Hunters Book 1) by Marc B. DeGeorge Release Date: July 7, 2025 Danny Lecker, Hand Hunter extraordinaire, is the best. No matter how allergic to love or bullets a future partner may be, Danny Lecker will always get her skip. But when business gets slow, a Hand Hunter can’t be choosy with her clients. Her next case may be far from union-approved, but it’ll do, as long as her client gets her allowance this week… Buy on Amazon Obsidian (Shadowbound Fae Book 1) by K.F. Breene Release Date: July 8, 2025 The Dark Fae never told me his name. Not when he tried to seduce me, and not before he purposely botched one of my jobs and stole what was mine — a dangerous relic with unlimited power. It has the ability to break kingdoms… and tear down the wall that separates the human world from the dangerous, wild magic of the fae. Buy on Amazon City of Smoke and Brimstone (House of Devils Book 4) by Kayla Edwards Release Date: July 8, 2025 For the past six months, Loren Calla’s life has consisted of one simple objective: stay alive. With the help of her new friends and the love of a ruthless Darkslayer, she has defied the odds. But with the Veil rapidly falling, and swarms of bloodthirsty creatures invading Yveswich, survival has once again stepped beyond her reach. Pushed into a war between worlds, she must ask herself a question: what—or who—is she willing to sacrifice for victory? For love? Buy on Amazon A Vow of Embers (The Eye of the Goddess Book 2) by Sariah Wilson Release Date: July 8, 2025 Lia is always prepared for battle, but being blackmailed into marriage by Prince Alexandros is a challenge too far. She has no choice. He’s holding her sister hostage to force her hand. But with this union built on betrayal and rage comes a contract. By the goddess’s law, the marriage must not be consummated. A relief to Lia. She’d rather commit regicide than fall into bed with a man she loathes. Buy on Amazon zaida Recommended Posts",
