  "text": "15 Jan 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Riftsiders: White Collar Crimes? The third book of the Riftsiders series delves deeper into the religious implications of the possessions that have been prominent in the story. It continues the line of “appearances and sterotypes aren’t always true.” What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Fantasy. Yes, I don’t like writing about the real world, I’d rather do it through metaphor. What books are on your TBR pile right now? My brother insists I read the autobiography of Geddy Lee. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? Spoiler: The one where readers will write me hate mail because what I have done to their favorite characters. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I have two laptops. One is JUST for writing, the other is everything else, like Warcraft. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? We don’t stop playing because we grow old. We grow old because we stop playing. – GB Shaw If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? Never judge until you learn.
