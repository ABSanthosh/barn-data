  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Stuck With The Hot Boss? I’ve always loved the idea that a bit of magic is involved in bringing couples together, so I decided to write a series of books where a type of fairy godmother, Miss Lovelock, makes it easier for couples of overcome obstacles and find their happy ever after. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Stuck With The Hot Boss, what would they be? Evie’s theme song is: “Talk Me Out of Him” by Erin Gibney, and Leo’s theme song is: “It’s My Life” by Bon Jovi because he’s a secret rock anthem fan. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Romantic comedy! I love reading and writing romcoms. I love crafting really funny jokes and one-liners, and I ADORE writing sexy, funny banter between characters What books are on your TBR pile right now? ‘Eye Candy’ by Esme Brett, ‘Book People’ by Jackie Ashenden, and ‘The Bookshop Detectives: Tea and Cake and Death’ by Gareth Ward and Louise Ward (cozy, funny crime). What scene in your book was your favorite to write? The scene in London Zoo. Zoos are an overlooked source of humorous material in my opinion. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I write while sitting up on my bed, and on any day there will be up to four cats cuddled beside me, and one dog (the other’s a British bulldog and she can’t get up on the bed, bless her) Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Stop panicking! It hardly ever works but the idea is still sound. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? I hope readers remember laughing, and feeling good about Evie and Leo’s rocky path to romance. Sign up for our email and we’ll send you the best new books in your favorite genres weekly.",
