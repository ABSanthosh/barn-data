  "description": "Finley has big dreams of becoming a podcast host. Her football player boyfriend, Jensen, has been supportive and has helped her prep for the auditions for the school’s podcast, which is hosted only by seniors. Finley is hoping to garner a co-host gig—a coveted spot that opens the door to an internship at the community college. But Jensen surprises her when he tries out, too. To her shock, he’s named a co-host, and she only gets a research position. Making it worse, during a hot mic moment on the school’s PA system, Jensen insults Finley’s podcasting abilities. Finley decides that since he stole her podcast host dream, she’s going to hit him where it hurts: football. Theo, Jensen’s nemesis on the team, is popular, good-looking, wealthy, and well-dressed. At a party at Theo’s house, former soccer player Finley discovers she’s good at kicking a football. Theo agrees to coach her, with the goal of taking away Jensen’s coveted spot as kicker. There’s chemistry between Finley and Theo, and their flirtatious relationship intensifies during their training. Finley’s first-person narration explores the ups and downs of self-esteem, self-doubt, and self-reflection that many high schoolers grapple with. Romance is the driving force of this endearing story’s momentum. Finley and Jensen read white, while Theo is cued Latine.",

Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 79 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller The finely drawn characters capture readers’ attention in this debut. Autumn and Phineas, nicknamed Finny, were born a week apart; their mothers are still best friends. Growing up, Autumn and Finny were like peas in a pod despite their differences: Autumn is “quirky and odd,” while Finny is “sweet and shy and everyone like[s] him.” But in eighth grade, Autumn and Finny stop being friends due to an unexpected kiss. They drift apart and find new friends, but their friendship keeps asserting itself at parties, shared holiday gatherings and random encounters. In the summer after graduation, Autumn and Finny reconnect and are finally ready to be more than friends. But on August 8, everything changes, and Autumn has to rely on all her strength to move on. Autumn’s coming-of-age is sensitively chronicled, with a wide range of experiences and events shaping her character. Even secondary characters are well-rounded, with their own histories and motivations. There’s not much plot here, but readers will relish the opportunity to climb inside Autumn’s head.   (Fiction. 14 \u0026 up) Pub Date: April 1, 2013 ISBN: 978-1-4022-7782-5 Page Count: 336 Publisher: Sourcebooks Fire Review Posted Online: Feb. 12, 2013 Kirkus Reviews Issue: March 1, 2013",
