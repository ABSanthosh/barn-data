  "text": "25 Feb 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write The Echo of Tombs? The Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson had a lot of influence on the book, and my own struggles with agoraphobia, and the way people treated me for having an invisible illness. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of The Echo of Tombs, what would they be? “The times they are a changin'” by Bob Dylan. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Fantasy and horror are my favorite genres to read, but I love writing all sorts of things. My first book is horror thriller and I have also written a crime thriller that I hope to publish in the future, but my main genre would have to be fantasy. What books are on your TBR pile right now? We Are The Dead by Mike Shackle. R. Scott Bakker The Darkness That Comes Before. Of Blood and Fire by Ryan Cahill. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? The spore caverns. I loved being able to explore the strange and exotic world deep below the ground and imagine the wonder of people seeing it for the first time. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I like to put a 45 pound weighted vest on and go for a walk whenever I get stuck on where to go next in my book. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? The pursuit of dreams isn’t some thing to be put aside by anything, it is the entire reason for everything. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? The love and passion I put into the characters. I’ve spent years with these wonderful people, have told their tales, and I want you to feel their plight, love, and hate as I have.
