View All posts by Community Summer is still summering according to Goodreads users, who are still adding love stories and thrillers to their tote bags. In fact, the ones they’re reaching for the most this week are the five books as last week, and in the very same order, too. Once again, the most read books on Goodreads are two capital-R romances, one love story, a thriller, and one outlier dystopian YA read. If you ask me, that tracks. Living in this timeline will have you reaching for books about government overreach and authoritarianism, and then make you crave books with happy endings and clean resolutions. Two New Books Out This Week You Should Know About Unfortunately, the most read books on Goodreads tend not to be diverse by any definition of the word. So, here are a couple of new books out this week that deserve wider readership. The Bewitching by Silvia Moreno-GarciaSilvia Moreno-Garcia’s latest horror novel is a witchy tale exploring the story of women from three different areas who get caught up in witchcraft. Minerva is a graduate student, studying the history of horror. When she discovers that horror author Beatrice Tremblay’s most famous novel was inspired by a true story, Minerva becomes obsessed with finding out the truth behind the manuscript. Decades earlier, when Tremblay attended the same university as Minerva, a girl went missing under mysterious circumstances. – Emily Martin Only Lovers in the Building by Nadine GonzalezWhen you spontaneously quit your job and get a short-term rental in Miami to read and figure out what you want to do with the rest of your life, the best thing that could happen is to discover that your handsome new neighbor shares your love of romance novels. What Lily doesn’t expect is to also fall in love with the entire wacky community she finds at The Icon, and to find that all the answers she’s looking for might be right in front of her.  – Jessica Pryde #5: Sunrise on the Reaping by Suzanne CollinsThe Hunger Games series is still just as relevant (if not more so) than it was when it started more than 15 years ago. Collins’s latest, which tells Haymitch Abernathy’s story, also sold 1.5 million copies in English in its first week. It was read by 17,000 users this week and is holding on to its 4.6 average rating.

In her newest thriller, Blake and his fiancée rent out a room in their house to a new tenant. Soon, strange things start happening around the house, and the neighbors begin treating them differently. This one was read by almost 18,000 Goodreads this week, and it has a 3.9 average rating. #3: One Golden Summer by Carley FortuneRomance readers love a seasonal read, and this looks like it’s the summer romance of the year! It follows Alice, who spent a perfect summer at her Nan’s cottage when she was 17. Now an adult, she returns to take care of her injured Nan—only to run into the guy who she crushed on as a teen. But is this a summer fling or something more? This one was read by just over 19,000 users this week and still has a 4.4 average rating. #2: Great Big Beautiful Life by Emily HenryEmily Henry is a staple author on the bestseller lists and the Goodreads most read list, so it’s no surprise to see her newest title here. It follows two writers competing to write the official biography of a reclusive heiress. It was read by 20,000 users this week and has a 4.0 average rating.",
