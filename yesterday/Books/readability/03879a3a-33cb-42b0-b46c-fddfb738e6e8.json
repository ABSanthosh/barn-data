As we eagerly await the release of Onyx Storm, the highly anticipated novel that promises to redefine modern fantasy, there’s no better time to dive into some incredible stories that have recently hit the shelves. Whether you’re looking to immerse yourself in sweeping sagas, connect with flawed but fascinating characters, or explore worlds brimming with wonder, this list has something for everyone. A Realm Of Dust And Sorrow (Elemental Realms) by H.M. Sandlin Release Date: December 25 2024 A dying world. Storms that bring death. And a girl determined to save her people. Senelow can’t stand it anymore. Her people are dying. The dryads are all but extinct. The storms keep coming, every year worse than the last. Can she discover the cause of the storms and save her people, or is this the end of Nadaira and the dryads? Buy on Amazon Hidden (Gods Among Us Book 1) by Melody Grace Hicks Release Date: November 18 2024 Shannon didn’t plan to become a goddess. Heck, she didn’t know they existed. One night with a sexy bad boy rocked her world and tumbled her into immortal worlds, strange new powers, and mythological dangers she’d never imagined could be real. How was she to know he wasn’t human or mortal? Buy on Amazon A Promise of Lies (Shadows of the Tenebris Court Book 3) by Clare Sager Release Date: December 31 2024 As the enemy’s hold on Kat tightens, secrets from the past threaten to unravel the courts’ fragile alliance.

Buy on Amazon Half Dead (Crossroads Queen Book 8) by Annabel Chase Release Date: January 2 2025 Lorelei is willing to do whatever it takes to protect the demon she loves, but if she can’t convince him to get in the game, they risk losing everything they’ve built together. When the supreme demon finally makes his move, Lorelei realizes there are some nightmares that even she can’t control. Buy on Amazon Fae Reckoning (Royals of Embermere Book 5) by Lucía Ashta Release Date: January 1 2025 But Elowyn’s destiny has been hidden from her all her life, and now she must master the magic she should have learned as a child when there’s no one to teach her. If she doesn’t, her mate bond will be destroyed, and the friends and dragons she’s sworn to save will all die. Buy on Amazon Cursed (Court of Isles Book 1) by Gina LaManna Release Date: December 31 2024 When Alessia discovers that she is the only remaining full-blooded Fae in existence, she accepts her responsibility to save the island, and everyone on it. The longer Alessia stays, the more she falls in love with her new home. For the first time ever, she feels like she belongs. Not least of all because of the intensely powerful man who has slowly been capturing her heart… Buy on Amazon meghan Recommended Posts",
