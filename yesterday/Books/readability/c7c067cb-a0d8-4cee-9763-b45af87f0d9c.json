Some fight the system, others fight their own fears, but all come out braver on the other side. The ADHD Advantage by Yvonne Joseph Release Date: June 10, 2025 ‘The ADHD Advantage’ is your empowering guide to thriving with ADHD. Using science-backed strategies, quick rituals, and relatable tools helps you boost focus, set boundaries, and embrace your unique brain, without shame or burnout. Just 20 minutes a day can change everything. Buy on Amazon Pretty Girl County by Lakita Wilson Release Date: July 1, 2025 Girls like Reya Samuels always come from Prince George’s County. Reya is rich and she’s not afraid to show it—she wears designer clothes, drives a custom pink Audi, and lives in a neighborhood tucked behind a fancy cast iron gate. She works hard, but she can get anything she wants with a snap. Buy on Amazon The Duchess by T.J. Starc Release Date: July 4, 2025 Duchess Azolaria “Zola” Thalassa Varnai has everything-status, privilege, power. And none of it feels like hers. At twenty-one, she’s in line for Lysvenia’s throne, but all she dreams about is freedom. Until freedom arrives in the form of Commander Reya Stravik: the King’s most stoic, disciplined soldier assigned to be her personal bodyguard. Older, sharp-eyed, and impossible to read, Reya is everything Zola isn’t, and everything she can’t stop wanting. Buy on Amazon Rogue Witch of Havenwood by Theresa Field Release Date: June 26, 2025 He called her his little star. Then he burned her world to ash. Elara was seven when her godfather Silas, the man her parents trusted above all others, arrived with torches and zealots to purge their village of “unworthy” magical bloodlines. She watched from the woods as he personally set fire to her home, her parents’ screams echoing through the night while he smiled. Everyone she loved. Everyone who ever mattered. Gone because their magic wasn’t “pure” enough for his twisted vision. Buy on Amazon Vesuvius by Cass Biehn Release Date: June 10, 2025 The end is coming. The gods are watching. This thrilling historical fantasy set in the days before Mount Vesuvius destroys Pompeii is a meet-cute with an explosive fallout. Clever thief Felix slips from city to city to survive the present and escape a past he can’t remember. When Felix steals a divine artifact—Mercury’s helmet—from a temple in Pompeii, pieces of his forgotten past begin to surface. Buy on Amazon The Truth About Fireflies by Sasha Hibbs Release Date: July 4, 2025 Seventeen-year-old football player, Brayden Anderson has his entire life planned out. He’s going to work with his dad’s construction business after graduation, support all the local sports teams, and maybe even go on to coach some of them. What did he never expect? To collide with peculiar, music-savant, Laurel Bennett. Buy on Amazon zaida Recommended Posts",
