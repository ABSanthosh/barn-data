With insight from trailblazing founders, strategists, and disruptors, they’re your blueprint for staying relevant and ahead. Not About Golf: The Life-Changing Joy of Playing The Game by Mike Berland Release Date: June 24, 2025 Not About Golf is a handbook for the golf curious that can inspire you to enhance your business connections, fall in love, and build a unique and fun community. Buy on Amazon Mastering Business Storytelling (The Business Storytelling Blueprint Book 1) by Taty Fittipaldi Release Date: June 24, 2025 Packed with insights from neuroscience, practical strategies, and real-world examples, this book is your ultimate guide to mastering the art of business storytelling. Whether you’re presenting to stakeholders, leading multicultural teams, or influencing key decisions, you’ll learn how to engage, persuade, and lead like never before. Buy on Amazon Complete Living Trusts Blueprint by Ellis Whitmore Release Date: May 27, 2025 What happens to everything you have worked for when you’re gone? This book guides you through the process and helps you decide if you can DIY or need an attorney. Probate could tie up your assets for months. Your family might fight over money instead of grieving together. Taxes might get the bulk of your estate. Don’t let this happen. Buy on Amazon LAUNCH Your Book! An Entrepreneur’s Guide to Reviews That Drive Revenue by Robbie Samuels Release Date: June 19, 2025 Too many books fade into obscurity—not because they’re poorly written, but because the author didn’t have a clear strategy for what happens after publication. A well-crafted book deserves more than a quiet release. Without a book launch team strategy, it won’t reach the people it’s meant to help—or generate the results you hoped for. Buy on Amazon The Wisdom Collection: Stories That Transform How We Live, Connect, and Lead by Ann Sheybani and More Release Date: June 14, 2025 This anthology brings together diverse voices united by their commitment to authentic transformation. Within these pages, you’ll discover personal narratives of reinvention, the courage to forgive, the freedom found in imperfection, and the subtle power of listening to your body’s wisdom. You’ll learn how calculated risks differ from reckless gambles, why standing for something matters more than ever in today’s marketplace, and how to navigate financial conversations with curiosity rather than fear. Buy on Amazon Let’s Retire Retirement: How to Enjoy Life to the Fullest—Now and Later by Derek Coburn \u0026 Sara Stibitz Release Date: June 3, 2025 In Let’s Retire Retirement, financial advisor Derek Coburn challenges the traditional concept of retirement and offers a compelling vision for a more fulfilling life. He explores the origins of retirement, debunking outdated myths and presenting a new approach that aligns with modern realities. Through relatable anecdotes and thought-provoking insights, he guides readers to rethink their long-term goals and embrace a life of continuous growth and satisfaction.
