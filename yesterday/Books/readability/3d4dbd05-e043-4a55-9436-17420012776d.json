  "text": "07 Jan 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Damned Yankees? I got the idea during my year-long study at the Naval War College in Newport, RI, for a master’s degree in National Security and Strtegic Studies. I took a Revolutionary War elective and became fascinated by the course premise that “those who fight their nation’s wars are typically those least able to avoid it.” If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Damned Yankees, what would they be? For my main character, Jack, it would be “Can’t Find My Way Home” by Steve Winwood. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I love to read fiction, almost any fiction. That is also my favorite to write. What books are on your TBR pile right now? I received a book for Christmas, “The Neon Rain,” by James Lee Burke. I don’t know anything about it. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? There are actually two scenes where someone is preaching a sermon. For some strange reason, those were both my favorite to write. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I like to pray before I write. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? We are not here to serve our own purpose but rather that which God created us for. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? That human nature is timeless and does not change.
