You mention that you like to read, they ask you for a few recommendations, and then…your mind goes blank. Books? What are those? Enter: the magic of a spreadsheet. Mine goes back to 2013, and let me tell you, that’s a wild time capsule. Whether you’re a book tracker from way back or just planning to start keeping a log of your reading, Book Riot’s 2025 reading log has you covered. How to Use the 2025 Reading Log Make a copy of the log from our locked template and make sure to save You do this by going to File–\u003eMake a Copy–\u003e[save as chosen name] Become familiar with the book categorizations on the first tab [which include everything from Author to Genre to Diversity (“POC”) to Disability Rep and Book Source] Next, look through the other tabs, which include Stats, Charts, the Read Harder Challenge, and the Book Spending Log, keeping in mind that the Charts tab will populate visual representations of your reading statistics as you fill them out, (also…you technically don’t have to look at the Book Spending Log tab if you are delulu like me) Our 2025 Read Harder tasks are already filled out in the Read Harder tab, which is another great way to expand your reading Looking for something more analog?
