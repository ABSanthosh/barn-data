  "description": "Debut author Rogers, a former financial planner, has some major problems with paper money. For one, currencies such as the United States dollar are not backed by anything substantial like precious metals; unlike years ago, when the U.S. had a gold standard, money now is issued purely on trust. This ushers in a host of problems: The government has the ability to manipulate the value of the dollar when they adjust interest rates, and, as the author explains, when governments create more currency “out of thin air, prices rise.” Enter into the global financial arena the “promise and potential of Bitcoin.” Per Rogers, part of the appeal of Bitcoin, a payment system using money that “can’t be made up out of thin air,” is that it reduces the risk of misuse by powerful figures—a government cannot simply make more Bitcoin tokens so that they can embark on massive, destructive projects like war. The book is more than just a work of advocacy for Bitcoin; it’s also about the relationships people have with money. The author proposes some intriguing ways in which Bitcoin, this “trustless, decentralized, and permissionless technology” could impact the world. Remove the power of groups like central banks to control money and, the argument goes, individuals can flourish in more free, productive ways. While Rogers reiterates the usual arguments against fiat currencies (like inflation), he also addresses impacts on the populace—for instance, he suggests that cryptocurrency could make absurdities like banks that are “too big to fail” obsolete. Portions of the text are dense and unwieldy: “Bitcoin offers the potential to free ourselves from the parasitic financial leeches draining the lifeblood from the economic body of humanity.” Ultimately, though, readers will come away with much to consider regarding how a technology like Bitcoin could be used to change the world for the better.",

  "text": "ELON MUSK by Walter Isaacson ‧ RELEASE DATE: Sept. 12, 2023 Alternately admiring and critical, unvarnished, and a closely detailed account of a troubled innovator. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 70 Our Verdict GET IT Kirkus Reviews' Best Books Of 2023 New York Times Bestseller A warts-and-all portrait of the famed techno-entrepreneur—and the warts are nearly beyond counting. To call Elon Musk (b. 1971) “mercurial” is to undervalue the term; to call him a genius is incorrect. Instead, Musk has a gift for leveraging the genius of others in order to make things work. When they don’t, writes eminent biographer Isaacson, it’s because the notoriously headstrong Musk is so sure of himself that he charges ahead against the advice of others: “He does not like to share power.” In this sharp-edged biography, the author likens Musk to an earlier biographical subject, Steve Jobs. Given Musk’s recent political turn, born of the me-first libertarianism of the very rich, however, Henry Ford also comes to mind. What emerges clearly is that Musk, who may or may not have Asperger’s syndrome (“Empathy did not come naturally”), has nurtured several obsessions for years, apart from a passion for the letter X as both a brand and personal name. He firmly believes that “all requirements should be treated as recommendations”; that it is his destiny to make humankind a multi-planetary civilization through innovations in space travel; that government is generally an impediment and that “the thought police are gaining power”; and that “a maniacal sense of urgency” should guide his businesses. That need for speed has led to undeniable successes in beating schedules and competitors, but it has also wrought disaster: One of the most telling anecdotes in the book concerns Musk’s “demon mode” order to relocate thousands of Twitter servers from Sacramento to Portland at breakneck speed, which trashed big parts of the system for months. To judge by Isaacson’s account, that may have been by design, for Musk’s idea of creative destruction seems to mean mostly chaos. Alternately admiring and critical, unvarnished, and a closely detailed account of a troubled innovator.
