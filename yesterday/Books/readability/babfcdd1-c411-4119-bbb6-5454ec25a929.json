  "description": "Columbus, Ohio, 1920: Stella Miller’s mother Clara is prone to unpredictable behavior, on one occasion pulling a pistol on the local druggist when he refuses to offer his products to her “on loan.” Clara abandons the family without explanation when Stella is only 4 years old, though Stella has a faint memory of her mother being forcibly driven off by her father and one of his friends. Stella’s father then sells the family home and moves the children into a dreary boarding house on Southwood Avenue. “The pillars were dirty,” notes Stella. “The house was a dingy gray color with peeling white trim. It looked unwelcoming. When we walked up the steps for the first time, I felt like we were trespassing on someone else’s property.” While their father works, the children are placed in the care of their landlady, Mrs. Spangler, whose cruelty and negligence leads to Stella’s sexual abuse at the hands of the woman’s teenage son. To survive, Stella clings to her siblings—who are sometimes helpful, sometimes not—and tries to grow into a woman more equipped to deal with the world than the tortured Clara was. At its best, the author’s observant prose contains brilliant, psychologically revealing details, as here when Stella’s father stops by to visit them at the boarding house: “I studied his melancholy face while Mrs. Spangler prepared supper. He suddenly looked different to me. He looked smaller. He looked weak for the first time. I wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed the back of it. He smelled like fresh soap.” The author reveals in the preface that the novel is based on the experiences of her grandmother, and the book sits uncomfortably between biography and fiction, with much of the meandering story related in summary form rather than as dramatized scenes. Simonye includes a section that delves into Clara’s backstory, highlighting some parallels between mother and daughter, but the intense focus on the tragedies in Stella’s life makes for a somewhat grueling reading experience.",

  "text": "THE WOMEN by Kristin Hannah ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 6, 2024 A dramatic, vividly detailed reconstruction of a little-known aspect of the Vietnam War. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 213 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller A young woman’s experience as a nurse in Vietnam casts a deep shadow over her life. When we learn that the farewell party in the opening scene is for Frances “Frankie” McGrath’s older brother—“a golden boy, a wild child who could make the hardest heart soften”—who is leaving to serve in Vietnam in 1966, we feel pretty certain that poor Finley McGrath is marked for death. Still, it’s a surprise when the fateful doorbell rings less than 20 pages later. His death inspires his sister to enlist as an Army nurse, and this turn of events is just the beginning of a roller coaster of a plot that’s impressive and engrossing if at times a bit formulaic. Hannah renders the experiences of the young women who served in Vietnam in all-encompassing detail. The first half of the book, set in gore-drenched hospital wards, mildewed dorm rooms, and boozy officers’ clubs, is an exciting read, tracking the transformation of virginal, uptight Frankie into a crack surgical nurse and woman of the world. Her tensely platonic romance with a married surgeon ends when his broken, unbreathing body is airlifted out by helicopter; she throws her pent-up passion into a wild affair with a soldier who happens to be her dead brother’s best friend. In the second part of the book, after the war, Frankie seems to experience every possible bad break. A drawback of the story is that none of the secondary characters in her life are fully three-dimensional: Her dismissive, chauvinistic father and tight-lipped, pill-popping mother, her fellow nurses, and her various love interests are more plot devices than people. You’ll wish you could have gone to Vegas and placed a bet on the ending—while it’s against all the odds, you’ll see it coming from a mile away. A dramatic, vividly detailed reconstruction of a little-known aspect of the Vietnam War.
