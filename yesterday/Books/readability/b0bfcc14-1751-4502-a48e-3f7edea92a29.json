  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Talking About Adolescence (Book 2)? The Talking About Adolescence series came from a very personal place for me. As both a healthcare provider and a parent, I’ve seen firsthand the struggles young people face—some of them truly heartbreaking. Moments of deep sadness, like hearing about losing lives from violence or suicide among teens, left a lasting impression on me, showing just how much they need support and guidance during such a vulnerable time. I wanted to create something that could really help, something accessible that teens could turn to for real, science-backed information about what’s happening in their bodies and minds. It’s not just about throwing facts at them—it’s about helping them understand themselves better, so they can make decisions that shape a brighter future. In a way, I see this series as offering them a map and a flashlight to find their way through the often confusing and overwhelming path of adolescence. My hope is that this series becomes more than just books; I want it to be a trusted source of support, empowering young people to rise above the challenges, avoid the hidden pitfalls, and embrace their full potential. If it can make even a small difference in their lives, then I feel I’ve done something truly meaningful. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Talking About Adolescence (Book 2), what would they be? “Rise Up” by Andra Day. It’s an empowering anthem that encourages resilience and perseverance, which aligns perfectly with the book’s themes. The lyrics emphasize overcoming challenges and rising above adversity, making it both enjoyable and inspirational for adolescents and teens. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I love reading young adult romance and inspirational nonfiction. There’s something so uplifting about the emotions and growth these genres capture. It’s no surprise that they’re also my favorite genre to write. I enjoy exploring relationships and personal journeys, making writing in these areas both meaningful and rewarding. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Insigh by Tasha Eurich. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? I enjoyed writing the section about brain development in adolescence. To make this complex topic more engaging, I used Minecraft—a popular 3D sandbox game—as an analogy. It helped me explain how the brain grows and builds connections in a fun and easy way for readers to understand. Seeing such an important concept come to life through something relatable made it a favorite for me to write. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) One of my quirkiest writing habits is listening to music that matches the emotion of the scene I’m about to write. It helps me immerse myself in the mood and bring out the right tone in my words. For instance, I might listen to Itzhak Perlman’s rendition of John Williams’ Schindler’s List theme when working on a particularly emotional section. The haunting violin stirs up a deep sorrow, translating into the emotions I want to convey in my writing. Music sets the stage for my creative process and helps me connect more deeply with the story. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? I’ve always believed, “If my writing can make a difference in even one person’s life, then it’s all worth it.” This philosophy is what keeps me going, especially on the days when writing feels like an uphill climb. It’s about more than just putting words on paper; it’s about creating something that connects, resonates, and helps someone feel seen or inspired. That thought alone makes all the effort feel meaningful. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? If there’s one thing I hope readers take away from my book, it’s this: Your teen years are a golden opportunity to nurture your rapidly growing body and brain. By understanding how they work and taking care of them now, you’re setting the foundation for an incredible future. This stage of life is precious—don’t let it slip by without making the most of it.
