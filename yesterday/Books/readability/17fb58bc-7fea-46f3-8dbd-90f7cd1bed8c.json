  "text": "If you are subscribed to our book club newsletter, In the Club, you’ve seen us mention Jenna Bush Hager and her monthly book club picks for her Read with Jenna Book Club. Since she started the book club in 2019, it’s helped make 47 books New York Times bestsellers. Now, she’s turning that bestseller-making energy to emerging writers. Her media company Thousand Voices and the Random House Publishing Group (RHPG) are partnering to launch an innovative publishing program. It’s simply titled “Thousand Voices x RHPG,” and will work with emerging writers across a range of genres—including suspense, romance, literary fiction, and memoir—editors, and publishing teams across RHPG’s imprints to publish books. During each book’s launch, Bush Hager will team up on a marketing campaign to publicize the book (that will be separate from her book club). On the new venture, Bush Hager said, “I’m thrilled to be partnering with the Random House Publishing Group to bring Thousand Voices Books to life. This new venture is a natural extension of my passion for books and reading, and an existing collaboration with writers and publishers, but still entirely new and exciting.” So far, Bush Hager has already acquired six books for the new program: Conform by Ariel Sullivan Laws and Logic by Debra Curtis Liar’s Dice by Juliet Faithfull June Baby by Shannon Garvey Abby Offsides by Anna McCallie Into the Blue by Emma Brodie The first book to be published under the Thousand Voices x RHPG program, Conform by Ariel Sullivan, is set to be published in October this year through Ballantine.
