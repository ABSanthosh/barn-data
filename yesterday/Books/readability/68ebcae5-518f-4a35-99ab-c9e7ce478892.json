  "description": "The author has spent over a decade teaching her writing method to a variety of audiences, helping to prompt procrastinators or aspiring writers who don’t know how to get started. The steps cover topics including generating ideas; developing characters, settings, and plots; and drafting and revision. Each day’s agenda begins with “warmups,” moves on to a core activity, and concludes with “stretches.” Readers are encouraged to begin with a clean slate, but they can also work on a project already in progress. The most helpful days are the fifth and seventh, when participants are expected to start some actual writing and to learn how to close-read and revise. The final section has suggestions on how to use the method beyond the initial brainstorming and kick-starting phase. The activities are all explained clearly and no doubt will prove easy to execute. The strengths of the workbook are its clarity, simplicity, and flexibility; writers who just need a nudge can use a few of these exercises in the space of an hour, while others may devote a week or more to completing all of the tasks comprehensively. This is a nuts-and-bolts guide to competently beginning a manuscript—there is no focus on the deep contemplation and insight that transform writing into meaningful art. The program is designed to elicit a sense of accomplishment, so there is a danger that the workshop itself can stand in for the creative product; more optimistically, these steps can help writers to embrace the joy of the process along with the end result. Adams is present as a guide and coach, reflecting on her own experiences and journey through the steps (“what’s worked best for me in frustrating times of ‘nothing is coming to me!’ is learning something new that also keeps my hands busy”), but she is never intrusive. This primer is most appropriate for new and amateur fiction writers, but anyone may glean a few helpful tips.",

  "text": "THE BACKYARD BIRD CHRONICLES by Amy Tan ; illustrated by Amy Tan ‧ RELEASE DATE: April 23, 2024 An ebullient nature lover’s paean to birds. A charming bird journey with the bestselling author. In his introduction to Tan’s “nature journal,” David Allen Sibley, the acclaimed ornithologist, nails the spirit of this book: a “collection of delightfully quirky, thoughtful, and personal observations of birds in sketches and words.” For years, Tan has looked out on her California backyard “paradise”—oaks, periwinkle vines, birch, Japanese maple, fuchsia shrubs—observing more than 60 species of birds, and she fashions her findings into delightful and approachable journal excerpts, accompanied by her gorgeous color sketches. As the entries—“a record of my life”—move along, the author becomes more adept at identifying and capturing them with words and pencils. Her first entry is September 16, 2017: Shortly after putting up hummingbird feeders, one of the tiny, delicate creatures landed on her hand and fed. “We have a relationship,” she writes. “I am in love.” By August 2018, her backyard “has become a menagerie of fledglings…all learning to fly.” Day by day, she has continued to learn more about the birds, their activities, and how she should relate to them; she also admits mistakes when they occur. In December 2018, she was excited to observe a Townsend’s Warbler—“Omigod! It’s looking at me. Displeased expression.” Battling pesky squirrels, Tan deployed Hot Pepper Suet to keep them away, and she deterred crows by hanging a fake one upside down. The author also declared war on outdoor cats when she learned they kill more than 1 billion birds per year. In May 2019, she notes that she spends $250 per month on beetle larvae. In June 2019, she confesses “spending more hours a day staring at birds than writing. How can I not?” Her last entry, on December 15, 2022, celebrates when an eating bird pauses, “looks and acknowledges I am there.” An ebullient nature lover’s paean to birds.
