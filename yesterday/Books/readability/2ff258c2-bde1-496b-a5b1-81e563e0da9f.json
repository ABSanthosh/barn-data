  "description": "As the story begins, the protagonist’s father Omar takes on the unenviable task of combing through his recently deceased son Nasser’s journal searching for confirmation of his alleged ties to terrorism. The narrative then moves to the past: Growing up in Alexandria, Egypt, in the 1980s and ’90s, Nasser El-Mohammedi is raised by Omar in an uncommonly secular fashion. An esteemed professor, Omar schools his son using his extensive personal library, and when Nasser comes of age, he falls in with a small group of brilliant friends who go on to study engineering. Their sisters and girlfriends become part of the group, too, and when two members of the cohort leave for America to pursue graduate studies, it is with heavy hearts for those they leave behind. Nasser, on the other hand, is confronted at his graduation by a long-lost uncle, who tells him he needs to come South because it is finally time to visit his mother’s real grave. Once there, Nasser discovers that his mother (who died when Nasser was a child) lived a life of immense secrecy and estrangement from her family due to her insistence upon pursuing a secondary education. When Nasser learns that Omar has lied about Nasser’s mother’s radical past for years, Nasser’s own latent radicalism is inflamed. America is rocked by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, setting the table for a new era of danger, radicalization, and division among Nasser’s once-bulletproof friend group. Elgammal’s novel is deeply felt and richly detailed, vividly capturing the gravity of the circumstances in which his characters find themselves: “Still, he hated the horrible helpless feeling that had seized him—history was happening, people were suffering and dying two miles from where they were sitting, and they couldn’t think of a single useful thing to do.” Some readers may wish to spend longer periods with a single character—Elgammal jumps perspectives regularly—but the shifting POV effect creates a rich texture that helps to separate the novel from its peers.",

  "text": "THE WEDDING PEOPLE by Alison Espach ‧ RELEASE DATE: July 30, 2024 Uneven but fitfully amusing. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 39 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller Betrayed by her husband, a severely depressed young woman gets drawn into the over-the-top festivities at a lavish wedding. Phoebe Stone, who teaches English literature at a St. Louis college, is plotting her own demise. Her husband, Matt, has left her for another woman, and Phoebe is taking it hard. Indeed, she's determined just where and how she will end it all: at an oceanfront hotel in Newport, where she will lie on a king-sized canopy bed and take a bottle of her cat’s painkillers. At the hotel, Phoebe meets bride-to-be Lila, a headstrong rich girl presiding over her own extravagant six-day wedding celebration. Lila thought she had booked every room in the hotel, and learning of Phoebe's suicidal intentions, she forbids this stray guest from disrupting the nuptials: “No. You definitely can’t kill yourself. This is my wedding week.” After the punchy opening, a grim flashback to the meltdown of Phoebe's marriage temporarily darkens the mood, but things pick up when spoiled Lila interrupts Phoebe's preparations and sweeps her up in the wedding juggernaut. The slide from earnest drama to broad farce is somewhat jarring, but from this point on, Espach crafts an enjoyable—if overstuffed—comedy of manners. When the original maid of honor drops out, Phoebe is persuaded, against her better judgment, to take her place. There’s some fun to be had here: The wedding party—including groom-to-be Gary, a widower, and his 11-year-old daughter—takes surfing lessons; the women in the group have a session with a Sex Woman. But it all goes on too long, and the humor can seem forced, reaching a low point when someone has sex with the vintage wedding car (you don’t want to know the details). Later, when two characters have a meet-cute in a hot tub, readers will guess exactly how the marriage plot resolves. Uneven but fitfully amusing.
