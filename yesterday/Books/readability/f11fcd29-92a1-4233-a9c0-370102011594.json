  "description": "In 1787, Mary Wollstonecraft is fired from her position as governess of three young women on the charge of being overly progressive; the incident is a microcosm of her uphill struggle to affect “an end to women’s blind obedience.” She returns to London to pursue her ambition to become a writer, and with the encouragement of publisher Joseph Johnson, she establishes a reputation as a radical reformer, especially with her Vindication of the Rights of Woman in 1792. However, despite her own efforts to control her passions, she becomes infatuated with the married artist Henry Fuseli. He indiscreetly boasts of her attachment to him, an embarrassment that threatens to ruin her good reputation. Obsessed with the ongoing revolution in France, she exiles herself to Paris, a tinderbox of political violence, and risks being imprisoned, as all foreigners are seen as potential spies. In this gripping “work of fiction told in chronological order” focusing on Wollstonecraft’s “late-blooming love affairs,” the legendary feminist is torn between the need to flee an increasingly unsafe Paris and her attachment to Captain Gilbert Imlay, an American adventurer and fellow writer. This account of Wollstonecraft’s life deftly manages to be both literarily inventive and faithful to the facts of her life. A fiercely independent woman dedicated to the liberty of women everywhere, Wollstonecraft in these pages struggles to reconcile her ideal of “rational love” with the consuming carnal desires she experiences. Mastro also thoughtfully depicts her intellectual crisis regarding the French Revolution; initially, she was enthusiastically in favor of it and pilloried Edmund Burke’s famous critique. But later, as the Revolution devolved into violence and tyranny, she came to wonder if he was actually right. The author’s prose authentically captures the dialogue of the time and powerfully evokes the contradictions that make Wollstonecraft’s legacy so richly complex.",

  "text": "THE NIGHTINGALE by Kristin Hannah ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 3, 2015 Still, a respectful and absorbing page-turner. Hannah’s new novel is an homage to the extraordinary courage and endurance of Frenchwomen during World War II. In 1995, an elderly unnamed widow is moving into an Oregon nursing home on the urging of her controlling son, Julien, a surgeon. This trajectory is interrupted when she receives an invitation to return to France to attend a ceremony honoring passeurs: people who aided the escape of others during the war. Cut to spring, 1940: Viann has said goodbye to husband Antoine, who's off to hold the Maginot line against invading Germans. She returns to tending her small farm, Le Jardin, in the Loire Valley, teaching at the local school and coping with daughter Sophie’s adolescent rebellion. Soon, that world is upended: The Germans march into Paris and refugees flee south, overrunning Viann’s land. Her long-estranged younger sister, Isabelle, who has been kicked out of multiple convent schools, is sent to Le Jardin by Julien, their father in Paris, a drunken, decidedly unpaternal Great War veteran. As the depredations increase in the occupied zone—food rationing, systematic looting, and the billeting of a German officer, Capt. Beck, at Le Jardin—Isabelle’s outspokenness is a liability. She joins the Resistance, volunteering for dangerous duty: shepherding downed Allied airmen across the Pyrenees to Spain. Code-named the Nightingale, Isabelle will rescue many before she's captured. Meanwhile, Viann’s journey from passive to active resistance is less dramatic but no less wrenching. Hannah vividly demonstrates how the Nazis, through starvation, intimidation and barbarity both casual and calculated, demoralized the French, engineering a community collapse that enabled the deportations and deaths of more than 70,000 Jews. Hannah’s proven storytelling skills are ideally suited to depicting such cataclysmic events, but her tendency to sentimentalize undermines the gravitas of this tale. Still, a respectful and absorbing page-turner.
