Meta’s argument in the suit hinges on a non-disparagement agreement Wynn-Williams signed when she was fired in 2017 after an investigation “found that she’d made “unfounded” statements.” (CNN notes that “Wynn-Williams implied in her book that she was fired in retaliation for reporting sexual harassment.”) Macmillan, which published Careless People, contends that it is not bound by the arbitration agreement. While the temporary ruling forces Wynn-Williams to halt promotion and do what she can to prevent further publication, it does not require any action by the publisher. Careless People remains available through all major retailers and, presumably, through your local bookshop. Sure would be a shame if we helped it hit the bestseller list.
