  "description": "Fifteen-year-old Dominic Cantrell is focused on baseball, getting his license, the school play he’s (reluctantly) acting in, and spending time with his two best friends, Farhad Shirvani and Mia Stark. That is, until Farhad’s family’s drugstore is burgled and vandalized in what is clearly a hate crime, and the girl Dom is dating turns out to have a complicated connection to a recent murder. These events push Dom into the role of a young Sherlock Holmes, tailing a car at night, recruiting his friends to observe suspicious interactions, and landing himself in extremely dangerous situations. The story moves along quickly, but this pace comes at the expense of details such as robust character development and descriptions. Farhad’s dad is from Pakistan, but this information doesn’t appear until a third of the way into the book (Dom and Mia are white). Deeply important conversations about racism, hate crimes, and depression arise, but the characters discuss the subjects only shallowly. Some of the teenspeak feels inauthentic and cliched. Ultimately, the novel deals with a very adult mystery disappointingly, merely scratching the surface of what could have been a more nuanced, believable story.",

  "text": "I HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS by Jeff Strand ‧ RELEASE DATE: March 1, 2014 Without that frame, this would have been a fine addition to the wacked-out summer-camp subgenre. Survival camp? How can you not have bad feelings about that? Sixteen-year-old nerd (or geek, but not dork) Henry Lambert has no desire to go to Strongwoods Survival Camp. His father thinks it might help Henry man up and free him of some of his odd phobias. Randy, Henry’s best friend since kindergarten, is excited at the prospect of going thanks to the camp’s promotional YouTube video, so Henry relents. When they arrive at the shabby camp in the middle of nowhere and meet the possibly insane counselor (and only staff member), Max, Henry’s bad feelings multiply. Max tries to train his five campers with a combination of carrot and stick, but the boys are not athletes, let alone survivalists. When a trio of gangsters drops in on the camp Games to try to collect the debt owed by the owner, the boys suddenly have to put their skills to the test. Too bad they don’t have any—at all. Strand’s summer-camp farce is peopled with sarcastic losers who’re chatty and wry. It’s often funny, and the gags turn in unexpected directions and would do Saturday Night Live skits proud. However, the story’s flow is hampered by an unnecessary and completely unfunny frame that takes place during the premier of the movie the boys make of their experience. The repeated intrusions bring the narrative to a screeching halt. Without that frame, this would have been a fine addition to the wacked-out summer-camp subgenre.
