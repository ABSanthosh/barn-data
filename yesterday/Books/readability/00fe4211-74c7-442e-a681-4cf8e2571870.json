  "description": "Falk explores themes of transience, memory, and grief in this book of poems rooted in nature. In the opening entry, the speaker’s muse informs her that she is unnecessary because the sky is a “stunning event” whose ever-changing inspiration is more powerful than imagination. In “It,” the poet describes a fleeting but blissful moment of nothingness, “the mind gently sweeping thought away / until the window is blank” before life’s noise rushes in again. As “Morning” dawns, the speaker admires the sunrise, determined to love her life despite regrets. In “Geranium,” she contemplates the flower’s “hot eye, / which glares back at you like fire.” A “Summer Storm” batters a garden, and the speaker wonders why some blooms survived while the peonies succumbed to the downpour. A bird careening into a window serves as an “Awakening.” Memories of childhood difficulties creep into some of the poems: “The Walls of My House” recalls tension between a girl and her mother, juxtaposed with a neighbor in a coma whose daughter waits at her bedside for “a half-spoken word, / any blessing or curse.” “What Kept Me Standing” recounts a father hitting his 13-year-old daughter so hard she bleeds all over her hot-pink sneakers. “Enduring” reassures readers that sorrow “will retreat” and that time “wrestles down grief,” allowing one to “re-emerge, whole and cleansed.” The final poem, “Open Gate,” invites readers “to begin again.” Falk plumbs the depths of emotional and ecological truths with these sparse but insightful verses. The poet captures the holiness of nature, from “falling petal, wind-lifted leaf, / shift of shadow on grass” to the healing, grounding powers of a “lush, chaotic” garden. Her words paint stunning portraits as she describes “The laden arms of the oak, the elm, / and the agitated hunger of the small jays, // the fat globes of white sugarmum / where bees suck love.” However, the poems may be too abstract and removed for readers who prefer a more direct approach.",

  "text": "THE BACKYARD BIRD CHRONICLES by Amy Tan ; illustrated by Amy Tan ‧ RELEASE DATE: April 23, 2024 An ebullient nature lover’s paean to birds. A charming bird journey with the bestselling author. In his introduction to Tan’s “nature journal,” David Allen Sibley, the acclaimed ornithologist, nails the spirit of this book: a “collection of delightfully quirky, thoughtful, and personal observations of birds in sketches and words.” For years, Tan has looked out on her California backyard “paradise”—oaks, periwinkle vines, birch, Japanese maple, fuchsia shrubs—observing more than 60 species of birds, and she fashions her findings into delightful and approachable journal excerpts, accompanied by her gorgeous color sketches. As the entries—“a record of my life”—move along, the author becomes more adept at identifying and capturing them with words and pencils. Her first entry is September 16, 2017: Shortly after putting up hummingbird feeders, one of the tiny, delicate creatures landed on her hand and fed. “We have a relationship,” she writes. “I am in love.” By August 2018, her backyard “has become a menagerie of fledglings…all learning to fly.” Day by day, she has continued to learn more about the birds, their activities, and how she should relate to them; she also admits mistakes when they occur. In December 2018, she was excited to observe a Townsend’s Warbler—“Omigod! It’s looking at me. Displeased expression.” Battling pesky squirrels, Tan deployed Hot Pepper Suet to keep them away, and she deterred crows by hanging a fake one upside down. The author also declared war on outdoor cats when she learned they kill more than 1 billion birds per year. In May 2019, she notes that she spends $250 per month on beetle larvae. In June 2019, she confesses “spending more hours a day staring at birds than writing. How can I not?” Her last entry, on December 15, 2022, celebrates when an eating bird pauses, “looks and acknowledges I am there.” An ebullient nature lover’s paean to birds.
