  "text": "07 Jan 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Admins: Simulation’s End? I was driving on a highway looking out and had one of those “wouldn’t it be cool…” moments, and the idea just transformed from there. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Science fiction, so yeah. That’s my sandbox! What books are on your TBR pile right now? I’ve been reading new indie books, and enjoying that. I enjoy the passion indie authors put in. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? Without spoiling anything, the big movie ending! Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I have a little tiny laptop that I write on exclusively. I use it to write from anywhere – inside, outside, Mars, etc. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? If I had to sum it up, it would be: Dogs are right and we are wrong. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? Empathy!!
