  "description": "Born out of the editors’ desire to “redress a long history of disinterest, ignorance, and/or active censorship around questions of gender and sexuality in art history and museum culture,” this lavish book by queer art historians Katz and Willis accompanies an exhibition at Wrightwood 659 in Chicago. It’s a project composed of a wide array of educative, informative, and opinionated essays alongside visually striking artwork illuminating the origin of queer identity evolving in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The representation of queer culture by a variety of talented artists and writers is on exquisite display; the book captures a period immersed in the struggle for greater queer visibility through the art of its era. Among the book’s more than 300 images—including paintings, drawings, sculptures, and photographs—are works by Berenice Abbott, Jean Cocteau, Thomas Eakins, and John Singer Sargent. A series of intellectually astute essays examines the origins of the word “homosexuality,” lesbian visibility in the arts, and the emergence of gender nonconformity in both the East and the West in the second half of the 19th century. The essays, many by culture experts, additionally analyze how the earliest artistic articulations of gender, sexuality, transgender identity, and same-sex desire and relationships would bloom into an emerging queer revolution of visibility, representation, and change. Organized geographically, provocative (frequently explicit) drawings, oil paintings, sculptures, and accompanying text vibrantly tell the story of a forgotten age in emerging queer history and how art became an escape and a method of survival for burgeoning homosexual populations across the globe.",

  "text": "DAVID HOCKNEY edited by Norman Rosenthal ‧ RELEASE DATE: June 3, 2025 A beautifully produced, engaging homage. Celebrating a beloved artist. Published to coincide with a major exhibition of works by British-born artist David Hockney (b. 1937) at the Fondation Louis Vuitton, Paris, this lushly illustrated volume offers a detailed overview of the artist’s life and work, along with chapters focused on his various styles and subject matter, a chronology, and a glossary of the many techniques he employed in his art, including camera lucida, computer, and video. Contributors of essays include noted art historians and curators, such as Norman Rosenthal, who edited the volume; Simon Schama; Anne Lyles; James Cahill; and François Michaud. Growing up in the north of England, Hockney was drawn to the light and sparkle that he found in Hollywood movies. When he finally arrived in Los Angeles, the sunlit landscapes inspired him, and his new sense of artistic freedom concurred with sexual freedom: As a gay man, he felt liberated from the constraints that had weighed on him in Britain, even in the “relative Bohemia” of the Royal College of Art. Essayists reflect on his artistic interests, such as landscapes, portraiture, flowers, and the opera—for which he created boldly exuberant sets—as well as on his influences and experimentation. Michaud examines the impact on Hockney of a visit to Paris in the 1970s, where he became familiar with Henri Matisse and his contemporaries from museum exhibitions. In the 1990s, visiting his mother and friends in Yorkshire, Hockney painted both outdoors and in the studio, experimenting with various media—including the photocopier and fax machine—as he worked to render the woodsy landscape. As a companion to the exhibition, the volume offers stunning reproductions of Hockney’s prolific works. Enormously popular with museumgoers, Hockney, Rosenthal exults, “transforms the ordinary and the everyday into the remarkable.” A beautifully produced, engaging homage.
