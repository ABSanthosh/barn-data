  "text": "25 Jun 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Finding Scarlet? Women in their fifties are so often overlooked as relevant protagonists in books, especially those who choose themselves, get divorced, and take risks. I originally published Finding Scarlet as The Scarlet D. It won some awards, but the reviews made me think this was more than a romance. So I created a new cover and renamed it Finding Scarlet. I felt it better addressed the themes of self-discovery, second chance romance, and friendships when starting over later in life. I like writing about strong women who defy societal stereotypes and attempt to move forward with conviction. It’s sometimes messy, but it’s real. As someone who went through a divorce, I like having that voice and perspective. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Finding Scarlet, what would they be? I have two original songs for this book! Thanks to the magic of AI, I was able to turn Stuck and Shattered Pieces into music. They’re on SoundCloud. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Historical fiction is my favorite genre to read. I love it when authors have the creative license to use history as a backdrop for their storytelling. I plan to write in that genre one of these days. And, of course, I love a good romance. What books are on your TBR pile right now? I am finishing “A Court of Thorns and Roses” by Sarah J. Maas. It’s not my usual genre, but I was curious about the whole romantasy genre. “All the Colors of the Dark” is next. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? I had so much fun writing this book. It’s hard to pick just one scene. I loved how Scarlet’s friendship with Missy evolved. Their interactions were fun and authentic. But the fundraiser event was a beautiful moment, but also potentially catastrophic. Balancing that was fun. (I am currently writing Missy’s story!) Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I do not. I have a few habits when it comes to writing. No rituals. I will send myself emails if inspiration strikes when I’m away from my computer. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Be true to yourself by being unapologetically you. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? I want readers to walk away cheering for love and second chances, regardless of age. Being open to possibility, even when you’re older, is a gift. Ultimately, I hope readers will enjoy the story for what it is: a story.
