Welcome to Today in Books, our daily round-up of literary headlines at the intersection of politics, culture, media, and more.Now We’re Cooking2025 has not been without interesting books so far, but March is when things really heat up. The month’s notable new releases include Karen Russell’s first new novel in more than a decade; Bob the Drag Queen’s Harriet Tubman: Live in Concert, which has one of the best slug line’s I’ve seen in recent years; the latest addition to the Hunger Games extended universe; and Nobel laureate Abdulrazak Gurnah’s Theft, among many more. I’d hasten to add Laila Lalami’s The Dream Hotel, which would be an excellent read on any timeline but is especially chilling as we watch big tech mine U.S. citizens’ data and erode our privacy in service of their profits in real time.
