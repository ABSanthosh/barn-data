  "description": "Alex and his mother (both portrayed with pale skin), along with their dog, Nico, sometimes go on adventures together—but often, “Mommy…wants to play with us but her body can’t.” Over a week, Mom experiences a new symptom each day—her specific illness isn’t disclosed—which Alex then explains to Nico, using easy-to-understand similes: “Mama can’t hike with us: her body is stiff like a ROBOT.” Each explanation concludes with his knowledge that his mother cares about him: She can’t go to the movies, but “I know she loves us by the way she plays puzzles with us when we return.” Although the story acknowledges that Alex often feels sad—as many kids would—it ends with a firmly hopeful assertion that Mom is seeing doctors to get well, and “better days” are ahead. It’s a tough subject for a kids’ book, but the straightforward text is perfectly augmented by Rewerenda’s soft, pastellike illustrations, often featuring literal depictions of Mom’s described discomfort—inviting readers to imagine, for instance, how it would feel to carry an elephant. It’s an impressively compassionate story about how persistent illness can affect a family.",

  "text": "SICK SIMON by Dan Krall ; illustrated by Dan Krall ‧ RELEASE DATE: Jan. 13, 2015 Though the science is not particularly solid, the message is an important one, and with the level of gross in the... Krall’s latest is a disgusting, tongue-in-cheek lesson in contagiousness. Simon loves school so much that even a cold (with its attendant snotty nose) won’t keep him home. He kisses his family and boards the bus, proceeding to vomit out the window on the way: “He…had fun the whole way,” the text understates. The merest contact or proximity leads others to suddenly, and unrealistically, sport Simon’s symptoms. The week includes show-and-tell, a zoo field trip, a game of kickball and a child-free bus on Friday afternoon, all the children having finally succumbed to his illness. The three germs that have been following him around all week finally introduce themselves and high-five him for being such a “germ hero.” Horrified, Simon does his best to stop their spread, washing his hands, covering his mouth, resting and hydrating, though the same cannot be said for one classmate on Monday morning. Krall’s illustrations work in the ick factor, his Photoshopped characters sporting oozing and dripping poison-green noses as each comes into contact with Simon. Careful observers may spot the colorful germs before they introduce themselves, but even those who don’t will want to go back and try to find all their appearances. Though the science is not particularly solid, the message is an important one, and with the level of gross in the illustrations, it is sure to get through to young audiences.
