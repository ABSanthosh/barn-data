  "description": "Charlie Wags is a small and fluffy brown dog who lives in a house with a lovely garden. He’s a very ordinary dog aside from his love of travel and his unique ability to wag his tail and teleport to brand-new fabulous locations. Today, Charlie has decided on Paris, and with a little wag, he’s off to the Louvre. Charlie goes to see the Palace of Versailles, takes a boat ride on the Seine, and marvels at the Eiffel Tower as it glitters beneath the nighttime sky. He even has time to stop at a cafe for some pastry delicacies (“a taste of Paris in each treat!”). Wells and Barclay tell a very gentle and sweet story. Sjöström’s illustrations are beautifully rendered in watercolors; in a unique touch, the texture of the watercolor paper is visible underneath the images. Much care was taken to create fully realized backgrounds for Charlie’s adventures. The text includes pronunciation guides for the French attractions on each page, though it may be difficult for beginning readers to decode the cursive writing. After the story’s conclusion, readers will find more information about each place Charlie visited in Paris.",

  "text": "CARPENTER'S HELPER by Sybil Rosen ; illustrated by Camille Garoche ‧ RELEASE DATE: March 16, 2021 Renata’s wren encounter proves magical, one most children could only wish to experience outside of this lovely story. A home-renovation project is interrupted by a family of wrens, allowing a young girl an up-close glimpse of nature. Renata and her father enjoy working on upgrading their bathroom, installing a clawfoot bathtub, and cutting a space for a new window. One warm night, after Papi leaves the window space open, two wrens begin making a nest in the bathroom. Rather than seeing it as an unfortunate delay of their project, Renata and Papi decide to let the avian carpenters continue their work. Renata witnesses the birth of four chicks as their rosy eggs split open “like coats that are suddenly too small.” Renata finds at a crucial moment that she can help the chicks learn to fly, even with the bittersweet knowledge that it will only hasten their exits from her life. Rosen uses lively language and well-chosen details to move the story of the baby birds forward. The text suggests the strong bond built by this Afro-Latinx father and daughter with their ongoing project without needing to point it out explicitly, a light touch in a picture book full of delicate, well-drawn moments and precise wording. Garoche’s drawings are impressively detailed, from the nest’s many small bits to the developing first feathers on the chicks and the wall smudges and exposed wiring of the renovation.
