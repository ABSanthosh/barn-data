Zainab Williams Welcome to Today in Books, our daily round-up of literary headlines at the intersection of politics, culture, media, and more. Some Major Fantasy Series News for Your Monday Fairy kink fans, rejoice. Late last week, Sarah J. Maas announced that she completed the first drafts of the sixth book in the A Court of Thorns and Roses series. Speculation about works in progress has already begun, with fans wondering if she’s also working on drafts for additional books. You can’t drop any kind of symbol or punctuation without getting the tea leaves treatment from the fandom, and the notebook in the image Maas posted to Instagram includes an arrow after “ACOTAR 6.” Hunt down ALL the Easter eggs! This is surely welcome news to readers who were anticipating the Hulu series adaptation only to be disappointed by the unraveling of that possibility. Win a 1-year subscription to Book of the Month! Imagine this: every month, for a year, you get to choose from new releases, curated by the Book of the Month team. Enter today.

The Millions’ Summer Book Preview If you’re looking for even more great summer reads, The Millions has you covered with their Great Summer 2025 Book Preview. I almost missed this list last week, so I wanted to make sure it was on your radar because it’s a beaut. You’ll find more than 100 summer 2025 releases their team is excited about. My personal standouts include, Make Your Way Home by Carrie R. Moore, which I loved, Hot Girls with Balls by Benedict Nguyễn, which has been the talk of the town, and The Dancing Face by Mike Phillips, which I remember also seeing on a bunch of anticipated lists earlier this year. Honestly, we have an embarrassment of riches this summer and this list is proof. This Isn’t Why I Don’t Do Book Clubs, But… This is why books are written about book clubs. Gather a bunch of opinionated, debate-ready people, possibly hand them an adult beverage, and prepare for off-the-page drama. This is the subject of a piece from The Guardian, which takes a look at the unraveling of book clubs with members recounting how people took feedback personally, spun book club tension into online discourse, or frequently waltzed in without reading the book, which sounds to me like walking into a classroom without having done the homework. Horrifying! A nightmare! This piece dredged up the memory of a particularly fraught session of the one book club I participated in, and happened to moderate, that makes me a little sweaty more than a decade later. The Best BIPOC Books of 2025 So Far We’re not done talking about the best books of the year so far, and if you’re looking for some great 2025 books by BIPOC authors released during the top half of the year, you’re in the right place. Find a “historical romance set in Belle Époque Paris, cli-fi set in a flooded San Francisco, a middle grade mystery set in Martha’s Vineyard, and a memoir on growing up queer in Florida,” and so much more.
