Welcome to Today in Books, our daily round-up of literary headlines at the intersection of politics, culture, media, and more. Sure, you’ve noticed that all romance covers look the same these days, but had you picked up on the lit fic trend of bright lettering over a (usually old) painting? It’s not a totally new concept, of course, but it is A Thing right now in a way that feels noteworthy. The NYT‘s Elisabeth Egan digs into the fad’s origins and explores the stories behind eight recent examples. That’s all interesting enough, but what really caught my attention is this bit of analysis: These covers are the new signifiers of stylish literary fiction, telegraphing gravitas, wit and cool. They make a bid for a certain kind of reader — more city than suburb, more pét-nat than chardonnay. They wouldn’t be caught dead alongside a volume decked out in pop art or, god forbid, metallic lettering. I hadn’t considered that this design trend might be a conscious choice to contrast literary fiction with the ubiquitous sprayed edges, foils, and stencils of romantasy. Whether intentional or not, it’s interesting to note, and I know I’ll be seeing it everywhere now. Don’t miss your chance to win a $200 Books-A-Million gift card! Enter the sweepstakes today.

It’s Never Too Late Oldster Magazine, founded by writer Sari Botton, is one of the great gifts of the contemporary internet, and this essay by Ruth Bonapace about what it’s like to publish your debut novel at the age of 70 is a perfect illustration of why. Bonapace recounts decades of dreaming and the false starts, impostor syndrome, and family obligations that repeatedly made her think it would never happen.
