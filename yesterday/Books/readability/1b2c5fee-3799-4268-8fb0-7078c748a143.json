View All posts by Community The American Library Association (ALA) and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees has filed a lawsuit against  the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), among other defendants, for “the Trump administration’s gutting of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS).” The lawsuit argues that DOGE’s actions against IMLS—including firing employees, ending the grant programs, and stopping all of the institute’s work—were illegal and unconstitutional. It claims that these actions violate Article I and Article II of the constitution. The organizations also say these actions will cause “immediate and disastrous consequences for Plaintiffs ALA and AFSCME as well as their members, including librarians, libraries, and the public,” continuing, “Without grant funding or IMLS staff to process reimbursements, local and state libraries will suffer an immediate and irreparable inability to pay vendors or staff hired in reliance on IMLS’ promise to make these reimbursements. In addition, IMLS provides important day-to-day services and advice to libraries across the country, which has already ceased, causing irreparable harm.” They further argue that “Congress is the only entity that may lawfully dismantle the agency, not the President and certainly not DOGE.” ALA president Cindy Hohl said in a statement, “Libraries play an important role in our democracy, from preserving history to providing access to government information, advancing literacy and civic engagement, and offering access to a variety of perspectives. These values are worth defending. We will not allow extremists to threaten our democracy by eliminating programs at IMLS and harming the children and communities who rely on libraries and the services and opportunities they provide.” Today In Books Sign up to Today In Books to receive daily news and miscellany from the world of books.",
