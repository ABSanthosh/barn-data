  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Eclipse of the Mourning Star? At a young age I knew I would eventually need to tell this story whether I wanted to or not. I began writing before quarantine. I think when the division of our communities reached a critical point a few years ago, I felt called to action. I thought that perhaps with so much conflict going on that my story of peace might be necessary. When I realized that it might actually help other people, I just had to write it, no matter the cost to my mental health. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Eclipse of the Mourning Star, what would they be? I love this question! As someone who makes playlists for every little moment, it’s hard to choose just one. I have several playlists for the book. Today, I’ll say “In My Life” by The Beatles. RIP to the other 138 amazing songs in the main character soundtrack matrix. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I’ve tried to avoid claiming genres in all artforms. This keeps me branching out, but also on the fringe. I gravitate towards the surreal and mind-bending, and a pinch of humor keeps me turning pages. What books are on your TBR pile right now? I’m currently reading My Cousin, My Gastroenterologist by Mark Leyner. The books at arm’s length are Erasure by Percival Everett, Japanese Death Poems by Zen monks and haiku poets on the verge of death, and Ringolevio: A Life Played for Keeps by Emmett Grogan. I recently began listening to Werner Herzog’s memoir, Every Man for Himself and God Against All. This is one book that must be listened to as opposed to read. I could listen to Herzog talk about anything for any amount of time. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? The Costa Rica scenes were certainly my favorite. They were a welcome break from the heavy nature of the book. Particularly the scene where Nico and I ride horses and get in trouble with our pre-teen tour guide. A close second would be the Symbiosis Music Festival chapter. I’ve never had such a good time making fun of myself. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) Yes, I have a highly superstitious and meaningful ritual. In it, I burn sage and summon the dead. I’m surrounded by strange trinkets in my den. If I have any memorabilia that could’ve belonged to a character I’m writing about, I’ll place that in front of me, such as the rattlesnake tail that my grandfather chopped off. The animals outside my window often stop by to criticize my work. So I take breaks for zoological production meetings. The attendees are birds of prey, coyotes, an unwelcome skunk if I’m writing late into the night, and even P-22, LA’s beloved mountain lion, once graced the neighborhood. There is one squirrel named Frank who is particularly brutal. He often kicks dirt at me through the window as he digs up my plants and scorns my prose. If anything I’ve written is good, it’s likely due to Frank. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? There are many ways to say never give up. I think Henry Ford captured perseverance when he said, “When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it.” If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? Change is always possible because hope is undefeated. Sign up for our email and we’ll send you the best new books in your favorite genres weekly.",
