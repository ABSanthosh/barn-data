  "text": "06 Nov 2024 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write The Optimal Performance Formula? Millions of people are chasing ambitious dreams, be that becoming a professional athlete, a famous performer, or a market leading company, yet most never make it as far as they would like. Sadly, this leaves them feeling powerless to choose and shape their own lives. I wanted people to know that it doesn’t have to be that way! In my 30+ years as a performance mentor to professional athletes and leading corporations, I’ve leveraged the research of leaders in performance science to decode what has the greatest impact on performance and I’ve modelled it in an actionable formula If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of The Optimal Performance Formula, what would they be? “Never Surrender” by Corey Hart. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Non fiction, especially around the science of performance and human potential. Yes, it’s the same. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Breathe by James Nestor and Endure by Alex Hutchinson. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? Hard to pick one. Probably the coaching case studies, as they’re based on real clients and writing them brought back some very valuable and important memories and lessons. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I tend to write late at night, when my son’s asleep and I don’t get many client calls. This is the only moment I can get 3 or 4 hours straight to focus and get into flow. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Impossible just means no one has done it….YET! If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? The message I want the audience to understand viscerally, as well as cognitively, is that people are able to achieve much more than they ever thought, but great dreams require a long-term commitment to focused work, sustained over an extended period.
