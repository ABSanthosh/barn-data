  "description": "It is easy to think of electric vehicles, green energy, and other advanced technology as surefire ways to save the planet, but award-winning journalist Beiser, author of The World in a Grain, advises us to look at the issues more deeply to assess the true costs. The author focuses on the metals required to power new-gen tech, which include huge amounts of copper and nickel as well as cobalt, boron, lithium, and less familiar substances like gallium and germanium. These elements are necessary for batteries and chips that support everything from EVs and smartphones to wind turbines and solar panels. A critical problem is that mining and refining these metals can, if not done carefully, create horrifying environmental and humanitarian problems. The key players in the global business are China and Russia, which deliberately chose to accept the damage in order to cut costs and corner the market. Both countries have shown themselves willing to leverage their positions for geopolitical advantage. Other countries have acknowledged the danger and are trying to catch up in the marketplace, but there is a long way to go. Beiser also investigates the global market in scrap, noting that the recycling of the metals in tech devices is useful but often exploitative to laborers. The U.S. has huge mineral resources, but to develop them without damaging the environment would be expensive. Beiser argues that the higher costs must be borne and that the cheap ride enjoyed so far is not really so cheap. This is a message that many people might not want to hear, but the author underlines the point that there is no real alternative.",

  "text": "THE BACKYARD BIRD CHRONICLES by Amy Tan ; illustrated by Amy Tan ‧ RELEASE DATE: April 23, 2024 An ebullient nature lover’s paean to birds. A charming bird journey with the bestselling author. In his introduction to Tan’s “nature journal,” David Allen Sibley, the acclaimed ornithologist, nails the spirit of this book: a “collection of delightfully quirky, thoughtful, and personal observations of birds in sketches and words.” For years, Tan has looked out on her California backyard “paradise”—oaks, periwinkle vines, birch, Japanese maple, fuchsia shrubs—observing more than 60 species of birds, and she fashions her findings into delightful and approachable journal excerpts, accompanied by her gorgeous color sketches. As the entries—“a record of my life”—move along, the author becomes more adept at identifying and capturing them with words and pencils. Her first entry is September 16, 2017: Shortly after putting up hummingbird feeders, one of the tiny, delicate creatures landed on her hand and fed. “We have a relationship,” she writes. “I am in love.” By August 2018, her backyard “has become a menagerie of fledglings…all learning to fly.” Day by day, she has continued to learn more about the birds, their activities, and how she should relate to them; she also admits mistakes when they occur. In December 2018, she was excited to observe a Townsend’s Warbler—“Omigod! It’s looking at me. Displeased expression.” Battling pesky squirrels, Tan deployed Hot Pepper Suet to keep them away, and she deterred crows by hanging a fake one upside down. The author also declared war on outdoor cats when she learned they kill more than 1 billion birds per year. In May 2019, she notes that she spends $250 per month on beetle larvae. In June 2019, she confesses “spending more hours a day staring at birds than writing. How can I not?” Her last entry, on December 15, 2022, celebrates when an eating bird pauses, “looks and acknowledges I am there.” An ebullient nature lover’s paean to birds.
