  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Public Speaking: Unlock the Power of Your Voice? I’ve always been a voracious reader, but with a demanding career, I never had time to write or publish a book. Now that I’m retired, I finally have the time to pursue this passion. The idea for Public Speaking: The Power of Your Voice came from our combined backgrounds—one in theater and the other in corporate communications. We saw how stage presence and messaging could make or break a speaker’s impact, and we wanted to create a practical, engaging guide to help people communicate with confidence. This book blends storytelling, humor, and real-world strategies to make public speaking less intimidating and more accessible. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Public Speaking: Unlock the Power of Your Voice, what would they be? If I had to pick theme songs for the ‘main character’ of Public Speaking: The Power of Your Voice—which is really the reader stepping up to speak with confidence—I’d go with two iconic Queen songs: ‘Don’t Stop Me Now’ – This song perfectly captures the energy and momentum of someone who’s found their voice and is owning the stage with enthusiasm. It’s all about unstoppable confidence. ‘We Will Rock You’ – Public speaking is about engaging an audience and making an impact, and this song’s rhythm and power reflect the kind of commanding presence a great speaker can have. Both songs embody the excitement, energy, and self-assurance that come with mastering public speaking! What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I read many different genres, but when I pick up a book, I’m usually looking for an escape from reality. I love fiction—especially mysteries, thrillers, and action-packed stories that keep me on the edge of my seat. There’s something about the suspense and the twists that make for an exciting read. What books are on your TBR pile right now? I’m always looking to learn something new, so my TBR pile is constantly growing. Right now, I’m focused on books about website design, social media marketing, and the use of AI. These areas are evolving rapidly, and as an author, understanding them is key to reaching a wider audience and staying ahead of the curve. I still love a good thriller or mystery when I want to unwind, but lately, I’ve been diving into books that help me sharpen my skills and adapt to the ever-changing digital landscape. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? Our favorite parts to write were the sections on stage fright and audience engagement. One of the things we wanted to do with this book was make public speaking feel approachable, even for those who are terrified of it. Writing this section allowed us to blend practical advice with humor and storytelling, which really reflects the book’s overall style. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I wouldn’t say I have any quirky writing habits, but I do have a persistent Maine Coon who insists on joining me whenever I sit down to work. He seems to think he’s part of the writing process! Most of my writing happens at my partner’s house, where we collaborate at the dining room table. It’s where we bounce ideas off each other, refine our concepts, and bring the book to life. Having that dedicated space (and a very opinionated cat) makes the process more fun. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? My motto is simple: enjoy what you’re doing and don’t put things off. Life is unpredictable, and you never know how much time you or your loved ones have, so it’s important to savor every moment. That mindset is what pushed us to finally put together this book—our first. I had thought about it for years, finally decided to go for it, and it’s been an incredibly rewarding experience. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? If there’s one thing I want readers to remember, it’s that public speaking doesn’t have to be scary—it can actually be fun. Engaging with an audience is an opportunity, not just a challenge. With the right mindset and techniques, anyone can turn nervous energy into confidence and even enjoy the experience. Speaking isn’t about perfection; it’s about connection, and that’s something anyone can learn. Sign up for our email and we’ll send you the best new books in your favorite genres weekly.",
