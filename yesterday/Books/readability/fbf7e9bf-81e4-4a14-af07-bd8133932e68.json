These six new mystery novels deliver the same pulse-pounding tension, intricate plots, and unforgettable characters. Perfect for anyone who loves a good whodunit or psychological thriller, these books are sure to keep you guessing until the very last page! Riftsiders: White Collar Crimes by Paul A. DeStefano Release Date: December 30 2024 The possessed team travels to New Orleans, where people are missing. Well, most parts of them are missing. Clues point to either a familiar adversary or something unnatural in the bayou. Friends and enemies old and new take things in unexpected directions. Buy on Amazon Track Her Down (Bree Taggert Book 9) by Melinda Leigh Release Date: January 14 2025 As Bree and Matt sift through the past—suspect by suspect—a tangled web of deception emerges, and the truth becomes harder to see. Because the victims’ entire lives were a lie. And the only way to protect the vulnerable girl is to unravel her parents’ secrets. Buy on Amazon The Big Empty (An Elvis Cole and Joe Pike Novel Book 20) by Robert Crais Release Date: January 14 2025 Elvis calls his ex-Marine friend, Joe Pike, for help, and they follow Tommy Beller’s trail into the depths of a monstrous, hidden evil. The case flips on its head, victims become predators, predators become prey, and the question becomes: Can Elvis Cole save them all from this nightmare? Buy on Amazon Field of Bones (Maddie Castle Book 6) by L.T. Ryan Release Date: January 14 2025 As Maddie investigates, she unravels a trail of deceit, corruption, and buried secrets that point to a dangerous conspiracy. With each step, the danger grows, and Maddie must rely on her instincts to navigate a deadly game where every move could be her last. Time is running out, and the stakes couldn’t be higher: uncover the truth or lose Daisy forever. Buy on Amazon Presumed Guilty by Scott Turow Release Date: January 14 2025 Faced with few choices and even fewer hopes, Bea begs Rusty to return to court one last time, to defend her son and to save their last best hope for happiness. For Rusty, the question is not whether to defend Aaron, or whether the boy is in fact innocent—it’s whether the system to which he has devoted his life can ever provide true justice for those who are presumed guilty. Buy on Amazon The Texas Murders (A Texas Ranger Thriller Book 3) by James Patterson Release Date: January 14 2025 Texas Ranger Rory Yates protects his home state wearing a five-pointed silver badge and carrying a Sig Sauer.. When a native woman disappears on the summer solstice, clues point to a cold case. Yates, a quick-draw champion, partners with expert archer Ava Cruz of the Tigua Tribal police. The investigation leads to the edges of Texas’s most unforgiving landscape, where the officers take dead aim with every shot in their arsenals. Buy on Amazon meghan Recommended Posts",
