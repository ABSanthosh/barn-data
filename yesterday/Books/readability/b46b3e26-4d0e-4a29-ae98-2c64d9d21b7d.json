  "text": "18 Jun 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Bittersweet Grounds? I’ve always been drawn to emotionally complicated love stories—especially the kind where people clash before they connect. Bittersweet Grounds came from a single scene that popped into my head: a barista flinging an apron across the room at a smug, dangerously charming stranger. From there, it unfolded into a story about identity, redemption, and the secrets that shape us. At its heart, it’s about a woman trying to hold onto the last thing she loves—and a man who doesn’t realize the one thing he’s missing has been beside him all along. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Bittersweet Grounds, what would they be? For Aria: “Control” by Halsey—raw, angry, and deeply vulnerable. For Drake: “Take Me to Church” by Hozier—dark, conflicted, and worshipful in a way he doesn’t want to admit. Together: “From the Dining Table” by Harry Styles—aching with everything unsaid. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Definitely contemporary romance with emotional depth. I love stories that combine sharp dialogue, complex relationships, and just enough angst to break your heart a little before putting it back together. So yes, what I read and what I write usually line up. The messier the feelings, the better. What books are on your TBR pile right now? You With a View by Jessica Joyce, Funny Story by Emily Henry, Before We Were Strangers by Renée Carlino, The Eden Series by Devney Perry. It’s a mix of heartbreak, chemistry, and small-town tension, which is basically my ideal emotional cocktail. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? The late-night kitchen scene where Aria and Drake almost cross a line they can’t uncross. There’s tension, heat, restraint, and a moment where she asks him why he looks at her like that—and he can’t bring himself to lie. It’s everything I love about romance: messy, intimate, and a little dangerous. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I write in the middle of chaos. I have five rescue cats, each with strong opinions about keyboard access, and a hilarious, strong-willed five-year-old with special needs who keeps life unpredictable in the best way. Quiet writing days are a myth in my house—so I’ve learned to draft scenes while reheating chicken nuggets, breaking up cat squabbles, or dictating dialogue into my phone at stoplights. It’s messy, but somehow, the words still find their way through. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Scarlett O’Hara said it best: “After all, tomorrow is another day.” Writing, like life, comes with plot twists you don’t see coming. When things get messy, I try to take a breath, regroup, and face the next chapter. There’s power in persistence—and a little drama never hurts, either. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? That real love lives in the messy middle. The characters who stay with us aren’t perfect—they’re flawed, wounded, stubborn, and trying their best. I hope readers walk away feeling like Aria and Drake could be people they know… or people they’ve been. Because sometimes, the most unforgettable stories are the ones that don’t flinch from the gray.
