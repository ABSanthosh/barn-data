  "text": "02 May 2025 Behind the Pages: This Week’s Top Biographies \u0026 Memoirs Discover the lives that shaped history and the personal stories that will inspire and move you. From iconic figures to everyday heroes, these biographies and memoirs offer raw, authentic insights into the triumphs, struggles, and unforgettable moments that define us. Me, Myself and AI by Stephan Roux Release Date: February 4, 2025 A raw, witty memoir of survival and reinvention. Left with nothing, Stephan takes on divorce court and corporate betrayal armed only with a Yorkshire Terrier, a pub booth, and AI. A true story of resilience, legal warfare, and finding your voice when no one else will. Book one of a wild trilogy. Buy on Amazon Uptown Girl by Christie Brinkley Release Date: April 29, 2025 In 1974, a twenty-year-old Christie Brinkley was “discovered” outside a Paris phone booth, which set off a meteoric modeling career that would land her on the covers of hundreds of magazines and cement her legacy as an All-American icon. Although she’s lived more than fifty years in the public eye, the full story of her roller-coaster life has never been told. Buy on Amazon My Next Breath by Jeremy Renner Release Date: April 29, 2025 Two-time Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner was the second most googled person in 2023… and not for his impressive filmography. His searing portrayals on film ranged from an Iraq-based army bomb technician in The Hurt Locker and a Boston bank robber in The Town to a crooked Camden mayor in American Hustle before he became heir to the Jason Bourne franchise (The Bourne Legacy). Amongst other iconic roles, he also captured hearts as fan-favorite comic book marksman Hawkeye in seven Marvel films. Buy on Amazon Notes to John by Joan Didion Release Date: April 22, 2025 In November 1999, Joan Didion began seeing a psychiatrist because, as she wrote to a friend, her family had had “a rough few years.” She described the sessions in a journal she created for her husband, John Gregory Dunne. Buy on Amazon The Golden Hour by Matthew Specktor Release Date: April 22, 2025 Matthew Specktor grew up in the film industry: the son of legendary CAA superagent Fred Specktor, his childhood was one where Beau Bridges came over for dinner, Martin Sheen’s daughter was his close friend, and Marlon Brando left long messages on the family answering machine. He would eventually spend time working in Hollywood himself, first as a reluctant studio executive and later as a screenwriter. Buy on Amazon Dianaworld by Edward White Release Date: April 29, 2025 Over the last forty years, the mythology of Princess Diana has turned the woman who was born Diana Spencer into a symbol for almost anything. From a harbinger of Brexit populism, an all-American consumer capitalist, and the savior of the British aristocracy, to a catalyst for #MeToo and—in the words of one superfan—“the biggest punk that’s come out of England,” Diana connects with a wider array of people than any member of the royal family ever has. We feel so familiar with Diana that it seems crushingly formal to use anything but her first name. Buy on Amazon zaida Recommended Posts",
