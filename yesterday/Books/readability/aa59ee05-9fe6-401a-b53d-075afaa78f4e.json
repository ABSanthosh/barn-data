  "description": "As America reels with racial injustice, war, and political upheaval, the story alternates between snapshots of the two figures’ personal and political struggles. Kennedy—aka RFK, or, as some call his politically ruthless incarnation, “Bad Bobby”—is profoundly transformed by his brother John F. Kennedy’s assassination. He publicly pushes for civil rights reforms while also secretly investigating conspiracy theories about JFK’s death​. RFK’s political aspirations overlap with the struggle for racial justice and lead to a tense but working relationship with King, who often finds Kennedy’s efforts on race insufficient. Meanwhile, King struggles to bear the burden of leading the civil rights movement. Threats loom on all sides, from violent white supremacists to conflicts among activists. Increasingly exhausted, King’s prophetic instincts foreshadow his own tragic killing. Kennedy’s presidential campaign makes groundbreaking efforts to connect with Black voters, even agreeing to a politically risky meeting with the Black Panthers​. The novel culminates in his June assassination. Carpenter uses colloquial language and rich inner monologues to paint a detailed picture of two men with a shared vision of justice. Their struggles are effectively shown to be both personal and political: Kennedy yearns to move beyond his privileged detachment, and King finds the responsibility of being America’s moral conscience to be enormously heavy. The moral thrust of the novel takes a page from King’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail​” in its assertion that white moderates slowed progress on civil rights. Yet, despite the novel’s successful depiction of the era’s tense, sweat-drenched atmosphere of violence and political maneuvering, the novel may leave readers wondering whether it adds insight or merely revisits already well-documented events, especially as much of this historical ground was already covered in David Margolick’s 2018 nonfiction book The Promise and the Dream and elsewhere.",

  "text": "THE NIGHTINGALE by Kristin Hannah ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 3, 2015 Still, a respectful and absorbing page-turner. Hannah’s new novel is an homage to the extraordinary courage and endurance of Frenchwomen during World War II. In 1995, an elderly unnamed widow is moving into an Oregon nursing home on the urging of her controlling son, Julien, a surgeon. This trajectory is interrupted when she receives an invitation to return to France to attend a ceremony honoring passeurs: people who aided the escape of others during the war. Cut to spring, 1940: Viann has said goodbye to husband Antoine, who's off to hold the Maginot line against invading Germans. She returns to tending her small farm, Le Jardin, in the Loire Valley, teaching at the local school and coping with daughter Sophie’s adolescent rebellion. Soon, that world is upended: The Germans march into Paris and refugees flee south, overrunning Viann’s land. Her long-estranged younger sister, Isabelle, who has been kicked out of multiple convent schools, is sent to Le Jardin by Julien, their father in Paris, a drunken, decidedly unpaternal Great War veteran. As the depredations increase in the occupied zone—food rationing, systematic looting, and the billeting of a German officer, Capt. Beck, at Le Jardin—Isabelle’s outspokenness is a liability. She joins the Resistance, volunteering for dangerous duty: shepherding downed Allied airmen across the Pyrenees to Spain. Code-named the Nightingale, Isabelle will rescue many before she's captured. Meanwhile, Viann’s journey from passive to active resistance is less dramatic but no less wrenching. Hannah vividly demonstrates how the Nazis, through starvation, intimidation and barbarity both casual and calculated, demoralized the French, engineering a community collapse that enabled the deportations and deaths of more than 70,000 Jews. Hannah’s proven storytelling skills are ideally suited to depicting such cataclysmic events, but her tendency to sentimentalize undermines the gravitas of this tale. Still, a respectful and absorbing page-turner.
