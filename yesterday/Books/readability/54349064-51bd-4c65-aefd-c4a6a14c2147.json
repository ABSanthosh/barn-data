  "description": "The Ollivaros family, late for a flight, sprints through an Atlanta airport. As teenager Nachton, younger sisters Amélie and Cécilie, and baby brother Ewan run through Gate 3, they enter the mysterious interdimensional portal right next to it. The kids land in Overtwixt, a group of nilands (floating islands) connected by bridges—an entire realm that sits between parallel worlds. “The Guide,” a centaur-like “centman,” greets the kids and insists that, as humans, they have the ability to oppose this world’s only other human, the Vizier, who’s seized power in Overtwixt. The siblings choose their “paths” from options that the Guide gives them, each with a corresponding role to play and quest to complete. Amélie, for example, as the Empress, “must build trust and loyalty” among the various races in Overtwixt, from the gnomen to the merpeople. The Vizier, meanwhile, is destroying bridges to trap people in this world, including the bridge to the Ollivaros children’s home. This opening series installment teems with impressive worldbuilding: Akers introduces the nilands and supporting characters without saturating the narrative in details. It helps that nearly all of the Overtwixt beings are recognizable fantasy types, including the horselike eqmen, female unicorns, and dragonlike drachmen. The kids have striking personalities; energetic 5-year-old Ewan has a distinctive speech impediment (calling someone named Berserker “Bazooka”), and foolhardy Nachton incessantly complains about being a not-so-active “Loremaster.” While action scenes occasionally crop up, this story primarily consists of Nachton and the others plotting to confront the cloaked-in-black Vizier, who makes relatively few appearances. Still, the exciting final act concludes with a worthy cliffhanger. Lewis’ sketchy illustrations boldly define myriad individuals; most of the images are akin to profile pics.",

  "text": "IF ONLY I HAD TOLD HER by Laura Nowlin ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 6, 2024 A heavy read about the harsh realities of tragedy and their effects on those left behind. In this companion novel to 2013’s If He Had Been With Me, three characters tell their sides of the story. Finn’s narrative starts three days before his death. He explores the progress of his unrequited love for best friend Autumn up until the day he finally expresses his feelings. Finn’s story ends with his tragic death, which leaves his close friends devastated, unmoored, and uncertain how to go on. Jack’s section follows, offering a heartbreaking look at what it’s like to live with grief. Jack works to overcome the anger he feels toward Sylvie, the girlfriend Finn was breaking up with when he died, and Autumn, the girl he was preparing to build his life around (but whom Jack believed wasn’t good enough for Finn). But when Jack sees how Autumn’s grief matches his own, it changes their understanding of one another. Autumn’s chapters trace her life without Finn as readers follow her struggles with mental health and balancing love and loss. Those who have read the earlier book will better connect with and feel for these characters, particularly since they’ll have a more well-rounded impression of Finn. The pain and anger is well written, and the novel highlights the most troublesome aspects of young adulthood: overconfidence sprinkled with heavy insecurities, fear-fueled decisions, bad communication, and brash judgments. Characters are cued white. A heavy read about the harsh realities of tragedy and their effects on those left behind.
