As the season of “Best Books of 2024” draws to a close, that only means one thing: time to talk about the biggest books of 2025! Goodreads has put together a list of the most anticipated books of 2025, using the number of times users have added titles to their Want To Read shelves. They have spotlighted 82 titles in all, separated into genres: Contemporary \u0026 Historical Fiction, Mysteries \u0026 Thrillers, Fantasy Novels, Sci-Fi Novels, Horror Novels, Romance Novels, Romantasy Novels, Young Adult Novels, and Nonfiction. Despite the title, these are the most anticipated books of the first half of 2025: only two of their picks are published after June. Considering that fall is usually the biggest publishing season, that means we have plenty more great books to look forward to. Here are just some of the titles Goodreads has selected as the most anticipated books of 2025. Place your preorders and library holds now!
