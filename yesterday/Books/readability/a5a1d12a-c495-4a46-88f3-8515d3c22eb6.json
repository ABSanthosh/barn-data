  "description": "Since his death in 1977, there has been no shortage of books about Elvis Presley, and each generally attempts to provide new insights into the legendary performer. Gibson is no different, in that she makes the claim that Presley’s sense of style matched his sometimes introverted, sometimes confident personality, both on- and offstage, whether he wore blue suede shoes, black leather pants, or bedazzled leisure suits. In other words, Gibson argues that one’s image, developed over time, can profoundly change one’s sense of identity and self-worth. Gibson certainly proves her thesis; however, in an age when images are so pervasive and research on the subject is so widespread, is this point in any way unique? The author, with jubilance and a conversational tone, believes it is; some readers may feel otherwise. Because of the narrow scope of her argument, the book largely becomes another linear historical survey of the entertainer’s life from his youth, when he thought he could become a caped superhero, to his death as a bloated, wasted shadow of his former self. Gibson names the looks that Elvis sported—from the “Young Pretender” and “Rockabilly Rebel” to the “Star-Spangled Superstar”—and how those styles influenced fans and future musicians, including k.d. lang, Harry Styles, and Lana Del Rey. Also included in the book are delightful photographs showing readers Elvis’ clothing styles, looks that Gibson explains chapter by chapter. Even with these images, though, much of the book reads like another straightforward chronology of a celebrity already revered by so many.",

  "text": "MELANIA by Melania Trump ‧ RELEASE DATE: Oct. 8, 2024 A slick, vacuous glimpse into the former first lady’s White House years. A carefully curated personal portrait. First ladies’ roles have evolved significantly in recent decades. Their memoirs typically reflect a spectrum of ambition and interests, offering insights into their values and personal lives. Melania Trump, however, stands out as exceptionally private and elusive. Her ultra-lean account attempts to shed light on her public duties, initiatives, and causes as first lady, and it defends certain actions like her controversial “I REALLY DON’T CARE, DO U?” jacket. The statement was directed at the media, not the border situation, she claims. Yet the book provides scant detail about her personal orbit or day-to-day interactions. The memoir opens with her well-known Slovenian origin story, successful modeling career, and whirlwind romance with Donald Trump, culminating in their 2005 marriage, followed by a snapshot of Election Day 2016: “Each time we were together that day, I was impressed by his calm.…This man is remarkably confident under pressure.” Once in the White House, Melania Trump describes her functions and numerous public events at home and abroad, which she asserts were more accomplished than media representations suggested. However, she rarely shares any personal interactions beyond close family ties, notably her affection for her son, Barron, and her sister, Ines. And of course she lavishes praise on her husband. Minimal anecdotes about White House or cabinet staff are included, and she carefully defuses her rumored tensions with Trump’s adult children, blandly stating, “While we may share the same last name, each of us is distinct with our own aspirations and paths to follow.” Although Melania’s desire to support causes related to children’s and women’s welfare feels authentic, the overall tenor of her memoir seems aimed at painting a glimmering portrait of her husband and her role, likely with an eye toward the forthcoming election. A slick, vacuous glimpse into the former first lady’s White House years.
