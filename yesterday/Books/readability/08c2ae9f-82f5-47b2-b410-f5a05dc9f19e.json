  "description": "In the opening pages of Marshall’s terrific—and terrifying—new thriller, Theodora Scott is on her way meet her fiance’s wealthy family. Having met and fallen for Connor Dalton at a friend’s party a mere six months earlier, Theo is ready to give love a chance. First, though, she has to navigate meeting his family at Idlewood, their isolated mountain retreat. As a rule, she learns, non–family members are not permitted apart from a handful of employees and a few locals who have special permission during hunting season. This delicious setup is promisingly sinister enough but, as Theo’s narration continues, it becomes clear that she has secrets of her own to keep: Some of that has to do with her earlier life as a child who was adopted by a fundamentalist religious couple, Beth and Joseph; some of it has to do with anonymous messages she’s been receiving, warning her to stay away from Connor. As the family gathering progresses, Theo survives the domesticity of “pie day” and a grilling by Connor’s sister, mother, and grandmother. Later, she also survives a far less domestic hunting session (and just as much of a grilling) with Connor’s grandfather. But it’s what Theo discovers when she snoops around an abandoned cabin in the family compound that threatens to blow everything she knew—and didn’t know—about herself wide open. Theo has always had vague, dreamlike, and splintered memories of her pre-adoption life—she was only 4 when she came to live with Beth and Joseph. But when her cabin exploration turns up an old photograph of herself as a child at Idlewild, that’s when Theo’s real-life (read: life-threatening) nightmare really begins.",

  "text": "WITCHCRAFT FOR WAYWARD GIRLS by Grady Hendrix ‧ RELEASE DATE: Jan. 14, 2025 A pulpy throwback that shines a light on abuses even magic can’t erase. Hung out to dry by the elders who betrayed them, a squad of pregnant teens fights back with old magic. Hendrix has a flair for applying inventive hooks to horror, and this book has a good one, chock-full with shades of V.C. Andrews, The Handmaid’s Tale, and Foxfire, to name a few. Our narrator, Neva Craven, is 15 and pregnant, a fate worse than death in the American South circa 1970. She’s taken by force to Wellwood House in Florida, a secretive home for unwed mothers where she’s given the name Fern. She’ll have the baby secretly and give it up for adoption, whether she likes it or not. Under the thumb of the house’s cruel mistress, Miss Wellwood, and complicit Dr. Vincent, Neva forges cautious alliance with her fellow captives—a new friend, Zinnia; budding revolutionary Rose; and young Holly, raped and impregnated by the very family minister slated to adopt her child. All seems lost until the arrival of a mysterious bookmobile and its librarian, Miss Parcae, who gives the girls an actual book of spells titled How To Be a Groovy Witch. There’s glee in seeing the powerless granted some well-deserved payback, but Hendrix never forgets his sweet spot, lacing the story with body horror and unspeakable cruelties that threaten to overwhelm every little victory. In truth, it’s not the paranormal elements that make this blast from the past so terrifying—although one character evolves into a suitably scary antagonist near the end—but the unspeakable, everyday atrocities leveled at children like these. As the girls lose their babies one by one, they soon devote themselves to secreting away Holly and her child. They get some help late in the game but for the most part they’re on their own, trapped between forces of darkness and society’s merciless judgement. A pulpy throwback that shines a light on abuses even magic can’t erase.
