  "text": "Last week, I shared a list of 650+ new queer books out in the first half of 2025. Now, I’m back with a spreadsheet of 250+ queer books coming out in the second half of the year. You might notice that those are pretty different numbers, and that’s because I usually learn about a lot of queer books closer to their release date. Fall is the biggest publishing season, and I expect to hear about a lot more queer books coming out then in the next few months. Still, this list can give you a jumpstart on the most anticipated queer books of July-December! Content for All Access members continues below. Click here for the spreadsheet of more than 250 LGBTQ books coming out in the second half of 2025! Feel free to make a copy to sort or filter by genre or representation. Because these books aren’t out yet, there are some I’m not sure about: the question marks mean I haven’t verified the representation yet. Feel free to let me know if you spot any errors!
