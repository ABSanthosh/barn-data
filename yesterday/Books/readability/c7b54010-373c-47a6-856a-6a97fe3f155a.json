  "description": "Although candidate Donald Trump “vowed to drain the influence peddling swamp in Washington, DC,” author Lewis asserts in the book’s introduction, “he did the exact opposite” as president. Particularly egregious is the administration’s intermingling of corporate and foreign interests, which, the author says, benefited many with access to the Oval Office. As an advisor to the president, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani ran a “parallel version of the State Department,” according to Lewis, which leveraged his connections to develop ties with regimes in Turkey, Russia, and Venezuela. The author asserts that Guiliani and his associates skirted regulations that had been in place since the 1930s passage of the Foreign Agents Registration Act and adopted autocratic tactics inside the American political system. Per the book’s convincing analysis, the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection was a “natural outcome of the never-ending persuasion games that occurred during Trump’s presidency,” as the administration effectively created an alternate reality via disinformation that played upon his supporters’ worst fears and biases. Lewis, a global traveler who once resided in Russia, writes that he first noticed early signs of what he deemed to be Russian interference in American politics after seeing social media accounts parrot “Putin’s talking points” with “English grammar mistakes common for Russian speakers.” Although the author doesn’t hold back on its critiques of Trump administration tactics, his book’s main strength is its painstaking research, which yielded more than 3,000 endnotes. There’s also a laudable dedication to accessibility, as readers unacquainted with the nuances of contemporary geopolitics will find this book’s explanations clear and concise. To that end, Lewis supplements his engaging narrative with a wealth of charts, reproductions of primary sources, textbox vignettes, and other visual elements. A comprehensive timeline of cited administration connections to Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, and Venezuela appears in a useful appendix.",

  "text": "ABUNDANCE by Ezra Klein \u0026 Derek Thompson ‧ RELEASE DATE: March 18, 2025 Cogent, well-timed ideas for meeting today’s biggest challenges. Helping liberals get out of their own way. Klein, a New York Times columnist, and Thompson, an Atlantic staffer, lean to the left, but they aren’t interrogating the usual suspects. Aware that many conservatives have no interest in their opinions, the authors target their own side’s “pathologies.” Why do red states greenlight the kind of renewable energy projects that often languish in blue states? Why does liberal California have the nation’s most severe homelessness and housing affordability crises? One big reason: Liberal leadership has ensnared itself in a web of well-intentioned yet often onerous “goals, standards, and rules.” This “procedural kludge,” partially shaped by lawyers who pioneered a “democracy by lawsuit” strategy in the 1960s, threatens to stymie key breakthroughs. Consider the anti-pollution laws passed after World War II. In the decades since, homeowners’ groups in liberal locales have cited such statutes in lawsuits meant to stop new affordable housing. Today, these laws “block the clean energy projects” required to tackle climate change. Nuclear energy is “inarguably safer” than the fossil fuel variety, but because Washington doesn’t always “properly weigh risk,” it almost never builds new reactors. Meanwhile, technologies that may cure disease or slash the carbon footprint of cement production benefit from government support, but too often the grant process “rewards caution and punishes outsider thinking.” The authors call this style of governing “everything-bagel liberalism,” so named because of its many government mandates. Instead, they envision “a politics of abundance” that would remake travel, work, and health. This won’t happen without “changing the processes that make building and inventing so hard.” It’s time, then, to scrutinize everything from municipal zoning regulations to the paperwork requirements for scientists getting federal funding. The authors’ debut as a duo is very smart and eminently useful. Cogent, well-timed ideas for meeting today’s biggest challenges.
