  "description": "Eleven-year-old Nick Sixsmith and her mother, Theo, pause their itinerant lives as arborists to return to Mistwood, the home of the ancient, magical ironwood trees. Frustrated by their inability to determine the cause of a rapidly spreading blight, Theo returns to the home she abandoned before Nick’s birth to look for clues in the ancestral Heart Grove. Nick and her 12-year-old cousin, Oliver, along with their friend Lizard, become enmeshed in disturbing mysteries surrounding the Forestry Company’s new mill. Soon, they must fight to protect not only these magnificent trees, but also the whole city. Aided by the maligned inhabitants of Underhill, including Lizard, whose underground homes in the caves formed by the roots of the ironwood trees are threatened, the extended Sixsmith family goes to battle, hoping to prevent an environmental and social disaster brought about by unmitigated avarice. This warmhearted fantasy set in a rich world of magical botany and strong family bonds will appeal to newer fantasy fans; more experienced readers may find the character development predictable and yearn for greater emotional depth and complexity, livelier dialogue, and more showing rather than telling in the narration. Fortunately, Nick is a likable protagonist, the plot is well paced, and the timely messages come across without too much heavy-handedness. Most main characters are cued white; Oliver has light-brown skin.",

  "text": "THE SCHOOL FOR GOOD AND EVIL From the School for Good and Evil series , Vol. 1 by Soman Chainani ; illustrated by Iacopo Bruno ‧ RELEASE DATE: May 14, 2013 Rich and strange (and kitted out with an eye-catching cover), but stronger in the set pieces than the internal logic. Chainani works an elaborate sea change akin to Gregory Maguire’s Wicked (1995), though he leaves the waters muddied. Every four years, two children, one regarded as particularly nice and the other particularly nasty, are snatched from the village of Gavaldon by the shadowy School Master to attend the divided titular school. Those who survive to graduate become major or minor characters in fairy tales. When it happens to sweet, Disney princess–like Sophie and  her friend Agatha, plain of features, sour of disposition and low of self-esteem, they are both horrified to discover that they’ve been dropped not where they expect but at Evil and at Good respectively. Gradually—too gradually, as the author strings out hundreds of pages of Hogwarts-style pranks, classroom mishaps and competitions both academic and romantic—it becomes clear that the placement wasn’t a mistake at all. Growing into their true natures amid revelations and marked physical changes, the two spark escalating rivalry between the wings of the school. This leads up to a vicious climactic fight that sees Good and Evil repeatedly switching sides. At this point, readers are likely to feel suddenly left behind, as, thanks to summary deus ex machina resolutions, everything turns out swell(ish). Rich and strange (and kitted out with an eye-catching cover), but stronger in the set pieces than the internal logic.
