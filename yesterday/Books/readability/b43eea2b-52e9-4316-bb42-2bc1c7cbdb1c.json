  "description": "After Count Lucian Cross is driven from his castle by vampire hunters, Vrykolakas, the god of vampires, turns him back into a human as part of a revenge plot. In his mortal form, Lucian, who’s cued white, can compete in the “marriage games” and court the future duke, all the while secretly sussing out which of the noteworthy families of the men and women also in the competition have connections to the monster hunters. If he’s successful in his tasks, Lucian will be rewarded with the return of his immortality—and more power than ever. Being human brings a slew of emotions that Lucian didn’t foresee, though, and he finds himself making friends, regretting past actions, and developing unexpected romantic feelings. Propelled by unfolding mysteries and shifting alliances, this story gets off to a slow start as Ferraro introduces the large cast, which is diverse in race and sexual orientation, and sets the scene. Patient readers are rewarded in the latter half, however, when the action and drama amp up. In the world of this story, which is set in England during a time reminiscent of the Regency era, racism and homophobia are nonexistent, allowing the tension to focus on the clash between humans and monsters. The side characters are mostly forgettable, but Lucian is a captivating romantic hero.",

  "text": "IF HE HAD BEEN WITH ME by Laura Nowlin ‧ RELEASE DATE: April 1, 2013 There’s not much plot here, but readers will relish the opportunity to climb inside Autumn’s head. The finely drawn characters capture readers’ attention in this debut. Autumn and Phineas, nicknamed Finny, were born a week apart; their mothers are still best friends. Growing up, Autumn and Finny were like peas in a pod despite their differences: Autumn is “quirky and odd,” while Finny is “sweet and shy and everyone like[s] him.” But in eighth grade, Autumn and Finny stop being friends due to an unexpected kiss. They drift apart and find new friends, but their friendship keeps asserting itself at parties, shared holiday gatherings and random encounters. In the summer after graduation, Autumn and Finny reconnect and are finally ready to be more than friends. But on August 8, everything changes, and Autumn has to rely on all her strength to move on. Autumn’s coming-of-age is sensitively chronicled, with a wide range of experiences and events shaping her character. Even secondary characters are well-rounded, with their own histories and motivations. There’s not much plot here, but readers will relish the opportunity to climb inside Autumn’s head.   (Fiction. 14 \u0026 up) Pub Date: April 1, 2013 ISBN: 978-1-4022-7782-5 Page Count: 336 Publisher: Sourcebooks Fire Review Posted Online: Feb. 12, 2013 Kirkus Reviews Issue: March 1, 2013",
