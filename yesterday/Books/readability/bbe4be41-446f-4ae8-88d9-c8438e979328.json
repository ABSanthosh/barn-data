  "text": "28 May 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write It Worked For Me: My Life Seizing Opportunity and Building Success? I had recently retired after 45 years in the computer industry with various health issues that had me wondering about longevity. I decided to write a memoir to leave to my three kids so they can understand how this all happened to Mom’s 4th child. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of It Worked For Me: My Life Seizing Opportunity and Building Success, what would they be? Mission: Impossible, The Beverly Hillbillies, and Jeopardy theme songs. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I like to read sports books, as well as books about the 1970s progressive rock band. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Commander Will Cushing: Daredevil Hero of the Civil War, by Jamie Malanowski. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? The Preface. I get emotional every time I think about it. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I like to listen to old movies I have seen ten or so times as a soundtrack, as it was music playing. The Godfather, White Heat, Pride of the Yankees, Von Ryan’s Express… Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? I always defer to 1992 and Rodney King…“Can’t we all just get along?” Sadly, nothing’s changed. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? Always have a Plan B, as well as a Plan Z. Perseverance usually pans out.
