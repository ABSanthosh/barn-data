  "text": "31 Jan 2025 6 New Romance Novels for Fans of Find Me Falling If you loved Find Me Falling and crave more heartfelt, atmospheric romances, you’re in for a treat. These six new romance novels capture the same blend of deep emotions, second chances, and the magic of unexpected connections. From sun-soaked settings to love stories that linger long after the last page, these books are perfect for anyone who believes in the power of love, redemption, and fate. Chasing Headlines (Chasing Victory Book 1) by J Rose Black Release Date: January 2 2025 They’re chasing the same dream. Too bad they’re not on the same team. After a public altercation with a reporter derails Breslin Cooper’s major league dreams, he’s stuck chasing his backup plan: college baseball at Texas State Tech. Liv Milline dreams of becoming a baseball scout and being part of the “family business.” But her father, an IML exec, holds one, ironclad rule: No baseball for Olivia. Buy on Amazon Playing With Love (Hollow Point Book 3) by Riley Edwards Release Date: January 28 2025 I thought I had my shot—going undercover is the perfect opportunity to remind her how good we were together—only to find out she wasn’t the same feisty, open-book, beautiful woman I’d met. She now had thorns and walls, and the harder I tried to break through her boundaries, the harder she pushed back. Buy on Amazon Borrowed Bride (Mafia Lords of Sin) by Ajme Williams Release Date: January 24 2025 I picked the pocket of New York’s most dangerous man. I never planned to see him again… Until he claimed me as his wife. Now I’m carrying his child – and his secrets. Buy on Amazon Make Your Play (Aston Archers Hockey Book 2) by Cali Melle Release Date: January 24 2025 His proposal: I marry him for his insurance and we get it annulled after the baby is born. It seems like the perfect solution, but as our arrangement unfolds and we continue to grow closer, it becomes even harder to ignore the electricity sizzling between us. The lines between real and fake are starting to blur, and I can’t help but wonder if there’s room for my son and I in his future. Buy on Amazon My Ex-Best Friends (Ex Marks the Spot) by Rebel Bloom Release Date: January 23 2025 Running from the altar in a wedding dress? Not exactly how I pictured my big day. But crashing back into the lives of my ex-best friends? That’s where the real trouble begins. Buy on Amazon Frozen Heart by Helena Newbury Release Date: January 7 2025 Now we’re trapped in a web of lies with his enemies closing in. No one thinks a curvy, bookish woman like me can survive in the brutal world of the Bratva. But I’ve been underestimated my entire life. I’ll do whatever it takes, become the mafia queen he needs me to be. This is my story and I’m fighting for my happy-ever-after. Buy on Amazon meghan Recommended Posts",
