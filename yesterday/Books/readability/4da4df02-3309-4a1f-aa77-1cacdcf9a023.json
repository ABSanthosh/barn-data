View All posts by Community Reese’s Book Club is one of the most popular and recognizable celebrity book clubs, and now it’s getting a weekly podcast. Bookmarked by Reese’s Book Club won’t be hosted by Reese Witherspoon, though: Danielle Robay (host of Question Everything and While You Were Streaming) is taking on that role. She will be joined by celebrities, authors, and “tastemakers”. The weekly episodes will each include a book recommendation and a Q\u0026A portion. The first episode is available June 24th and features authors Emily Henry and Yulin Kuang. Emily Henry’s Great Big Beautiful Life was the Reese’s Book Club pick for May 2025, and Yulin Kuang’s How to End a Love Story was the pick for May 2024. The podcast is being produced by Witherspoon’s media company Hello Sunshine alongside iHeartMedia’s iHeartPodcasts. Reese Witherspoon, Danielle Robay, Maureen Polo (Hello Sunshine), Ali Perry (iHeartPodcasts), and Conal Byrne (iHeartPodcasts) are the executive producers. Read more at Variety.
