  "description": "Caro Ogunyemi works as an engineer aboard the spaceship Calamity, and there isn’t a piece of tech she can’t operate, repair, or hack. While her crew is on leave, she accepts a job to infiltrate Shikigami, a luxury prison planet for wealthy criminals operated by the Pierce family. Her mission is to find evidence that Carmichael Pierce has a secret lab at the prison where he’s using stolen tech to build supersoldiers out of unwilling test subjects. Caro’s shameful secret is that she worked for Pierce a decade ago, and she suspects some code she developed and attempted to destroy might be part of the supersoldier protocol. Once on planet, Caro learns that most of Pierce’s attempts to create supersoldiers have failed, with the exception of a terrifying specimen they call Leviathan—and her bungled attempt to infiltrate the prison puts her into a face-off with him. During the life-or-death fight, Caro discovers that her touch deactivates Leviathan’s chip, which allows him to reason and think for himself as long as she can keep her hands on him. Caro feels instantly attracted to Levi as his real self, and he feels a similar pull, calling her “angel” and begging her not to abandon him. Caro is charmed by the man behind the programming and vows to save him. With the help of two undercover friends, Caro makes a plan to destroy all of Pierce’s records and extract Levi. Everything that can go wrong does, leading to a series of high-stakes and at times hilarious adventures. Caro is a robust, interesting character, and her sweet romance with Levi allows her to forgive herself for past mistakes. The gang’s adventures on the prison planet are a rollicking good time, with complex, fast-paced plotting and intricately choreographed action sequences.",

  "text": "DEEP END by Ali Hazelwood ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 4, 2025 A surprisingly sensual sports romance. A collegiate diver and swimmer secretly pursue kink together, and risk falling in love along the way. Scarlett Vandermeer is struggling. Despite a successful recovery from the injury that almost ended her Stanford diving career, she hasn’t been able to get her head together, and it’s affecting her performance. Plus, she’s trying to stay focused on getting into medical school. A relationship would be out of the question. By comparison, Lukas Blomqvist is a swimming idol, a record-breaker who wins medals as easily as breathing, and Scarlett has long been convinced he would never look in her direction—until one fateful night when a mutual friend lets slip that they have something unexpected in common: Scarlett likes to be submissive in the bedroom, while Lukas prefers to take a dominant approach. Now, they both know a big secret about each other, and it’s something neither of them can stop thinking about. It’s Lukas who suggests they have a fling—purely physical, just to take the edge off, so Scarlett can get out of her own head and stop overthinking her dives. Initially, their arrangement is easy to stick to, but the more time they spend together, the more Scarlett starts to realize that what she feels for Lukas is more than physical attraction. Complicating the situation is the fact that Scarlett’s friend Penelope Ross used to go out with Lukas, and the longer Scarlett keeps mum about her true feelings for him, the more difficult it is to keep the situation hidden from another person she really cares about. While Scarlett and Lukas’ relationship does begin as a physical one, their deeper psychological connection takes a little too long to emerge amid all the other storylines, resulting in a somewhat rushed resolution. However, Hazelwood’s latest is proof of the depth and maturity that has emerged in her writing over the years, and it highlights her embrace of sexier, more emotional elements than were present in her original STEMinist rom-coms.
