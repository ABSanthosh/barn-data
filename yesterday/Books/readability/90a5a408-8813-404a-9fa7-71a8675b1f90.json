  "description": "The family begins saving eggshells in January, carefully blowing out the yolks and whites through small holes. By the time Easter nears, they’ve collected 100 empty shells, ready to be painted in bright, vibrant colors. Next, the family members fill each egg with confetti and seal the holes with glue and tissue paper. It’s hard to wait for Easter, but when the day arrives, Papá hides the eggs in the park for the youngest family members to find. The narrator’s younger brother, Nicolás, has just learned to walk, so this will be his first egg hunt! After all the eggs are found, Nicolás gets a big surprise when his sibling shows him an especially fun tradition: cracking the filled eggs on each other’s heads, creating a colorful explosion of confetti. The children delight in the messy fun. This sweet, simple story not only carefully describes the process of making cascarones, but also captures the pure joy of cracking the eggs. The vibrant watercolor illustrations highlight the cultural celebration, with expressive faces adding to the charm. Presented in both English and Spanish (with Ventura Medina providing the Spanish translation), this bilingual story allows readers to enjoy the narrative in both languages. Characters are Latine, with brown skin and hair.",

  "text": "DR. SEUSS'S HOW THE GRINCH LOST CHRISTMAS! by Alastair Heim ; illustrated by Aristides Ruiz ‧ RELEASE DATE: Sept. 5, 2023 It’s not whether you win or lose; it’s how many mediocre sequels you can squeeze out of Seussian property. Since a reformed Grinch is hardly any fun, this follow-up Grinches him up once more. Those seeking more of the same, prepare to receive precisely that. Christmas is coming (again!), and the Grinch can hardly wait. He’s been patient all year, and now he can finally show the Whos down in Who-ville how much he’s changed. When the Grinch learns of a tree-decorating contest, he figures that if he wins, it’ll prove he truly has the Christmas spirit. He throws himself into the task, but when it comes time to judge the trees, the Grinch is horrified to discover that he’s received only the second-place trophy. Can Cindy-Lou Who find the words to save the day? Replicating many of the original beats and wordplay of the original, this tale feels like less a sequel and more like a vaguely rewritten variation. Meanwhile, Ruiz’s art seeks to bridge the gap between the animated Chuck Jones version of the Grinch and the one depicted in the original book. This thankless task results in a strange uncanny valley between Seuss and Jones but does allow the artist a chance to colorize everything and lend some racial diversity to the Who population (Cindy-Lou is light-skinned). (This book was reviewed digitally.) It’s not whether you win or lose; it’s how many mediocre sequels you can squeeze out of Seussian property.
