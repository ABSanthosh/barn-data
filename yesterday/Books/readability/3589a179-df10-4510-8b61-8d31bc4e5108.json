  "description": "Fiona McConnell grew up running a struggling catering business in Los Angeles with her father. As an adult, her big dreams and optimistic attitude have propelled her from kitchens filled with cockroaches to culinary school to a solid career as a pastry cook. Still living in LA, she’s often surrounded by close friends who believe in her dreams and her considerable talent. But, suddenly, a change of staff causes her boss, Julia Stone—owner of the high-end restaurant Lucien—to promote her from a cook to a probationary pastry chef. While navigating a local produce market, Fiona meets Rory, the son of a farmer who’s well known for having the very best fruit around, and this new connection leads to new romantic adventures. Back at Lucien, a new head chef is hired who makes it clear from day one that there will be no room for mistakes—and absolutely no mercy for those who dare to stray from his vision: “I have a single-minded purpose—one goal. I want our food to be worth the journey.” In the cutthroat world of culinary cuisine, the constant criticism makes Fiona realize that she’ll have to make a choice that could change her life’s path. Over the course of this novel, Christensen delivers a delightful and multifaceted story that follows a feel-good thread about hard work, forgiveness, and redemption, while also pursuing an entertaining romantic plotline. The appealing cast of characters features not only a likable lead, but also close friends, romantic partners,and fierce villains.Overall, the subject matter gives readers an engaging peek into the world of how premiere restaurants fight for Michelin stars. The quick pace also helps to make this novel a fine beach read.",

  "text": "SHIELD OF SPARROWS by Devney Perry ‧ RELEASE DATE: May 6, 2025 A thrilling, immersive tale that shows that some bargains demand more than just a crown. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 102 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller A reluctant princess is thrust into deadly political intrigue in Perry’s sweeping, high-stakes romantasy. Odessa is the overlooked and underestimated princess of Quentis, whose life takes an unexpected turn when a deal is struck between her father and the formidable Turan warriors force her into an arranged marriage with their enigmatic prince, Zavier Wolfe. Intended as a mere formality to secure trade routes and military alliances, the betrothal spirals into something far more dangerous when ancient magic, a ruthless Guardian, and a looming war threaten to upend everything she knows. Finally emerging from the shadow of her seemingly perfect half sister, Mae, Odessa must navigate court politics, monstrous creatures, and her own uncertain place in a world where survival often depends on strategy rather than strength. As tensions rise, she finds herself entangled with the dangerous, enigmatic Guardian—a man whose silver eyes hold secrets of their own. Perry’s worldbuilding is lush and immersive, crafting a kingdom rife with old magic, deadly beasts, and political machinations that add depth. The pacing is relentless, carrying Odessa from one life-altering event to another as she grapples with duty, defiance, and a destiny she never chose. Her internal conflict is compelling, torn between the expectations placed upon her and the fierce independence that threatens to make her an outcast in her own kingdom. Romance simmers as Odessa struggles to reconcile her obligations with her growing attraction to the Guardian, whose past is as shadowed as his reputation. Mae is introduced as Odessa’s political foil, and although her presence drives much of Odessa’s internal drama—being constantly overshadowed or underestimated—she’s mostly seen through Odessa’s perspective. Her motivations, ambitions, and political maneuverings might have benefited from deeper exploration to give more nuance to the power dynamics. However, Perry’s evocative prose and intricate plotting make for a gripping tale. Readers looking for a slow-burn romantasy with rich political intrigue and a protagonist forced to create her own fate will find much to enjoy. A thrilling, immersive tale that shows that some bargains demand more than just a crown.
