  "description": "Jones is an officer in the Canadian Navy deployed to Kandahar, Afghanistan, as one of the small number of Canadians there taking part in the American-led Operation Enduring Freedom. He is a drone operator, charged with eliminating enemy combatants from afar, guided less by moral restraint than a diligent regard for the rules of engagement. His superior Bell is less cautious and pines to let the bombs fly, almost killing a young boy they nickname Sahar (they nickname most of their targets) for the crime of suspiciously filling a sack with potatoes. Everywhere, Jones sees the ravages of war and violence (he witnesses a woman savagely stoned for her alleged adultery) and wrestles with the toll all of this exacts on his soul. (“I have forgotten how to human.”) He becomes the caretaker of a bizarre man he meets on base—he is not a soldier and resembles some sort of “tremendous gorilla-bear.” Jones nicknames him Bigfoot, though his actual name is Noah. Keeping Noah safe and hidden from the authorities is foolishly imprudent, but it’s an act of moral compassion that feels redemptive to Jones. The author artfully juxtaposes the ugly and the beautiful in war—his protagonist falls in love with Jen, his major, but military rules prevent him from even hugging her; real romance is replaced by discreet “chess games.” Meanwhile, a rapist targets the men on base, tasing the soldiers into submission before he violates them. The author’s prose sometimes falters, trying too hard for some creative amalgam of clever and moving—when Jones encounters a terrible scene, he thinks to himself, “No—not like this. No. No NO NO NO. Rewind, damnit—rewind!” However, the strength of the novel is its unflinching look at the absurdity of modern war, which reduces the destruction of human beings to a video game; the chilling senselessness of this is intelligently captured. This is a disturbing work of fiction, but a worthwhile one.",

  "text": "THE WEDDING PEOPLE by Alison Espach ‧ RELEASE DATE: July 30, 2024 Uneven but fitfully amusing. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 15 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller Betrayed by her husband, a severely depressed young woman gets drawn into the over-the-top festivities at a lavish wedding. Phoebe Stone, who teaches English literature at a St. Louis college, is plotting her own demise. Her husband, Matt, has left her for another woman, and Phoebe is taking it hard. Indeed, she's determined just where and how she will end it all: at an oceanfront hotel in Newport, where she will lie on a king-sized canopy bed and take a bottle of her cat’s painkillers. At the hotel, Phoebe meets bride-to-be Lila, a headstrong rich girl presiding over her own extravagant six-day wedding celebration. Lila thought she had booked every room in the hotel, and learning of Phoebe's suicidal intentions, she forbids this stray guest from disrupting the nuptials: “No. You definitely can’t kill yourself. This is my wedding week.” After the punchy opening, a grim flashback to the meltdown of Phoebe's marriage temporarily darkens the mood, but things pick up when spoiled Lila interrupts Phoebe's preparations and sweeps her up in the wedding juggernaut. The slide from earnest drama to broad farce is somewhat jarring, but from this point on, Espach crafts an enjoyable—if overstuffed—comedy of manners. When the original maid of honor drops out, Phoebe is persuaded, against her better judgment, to take her place. There’s some fun to be had here: The wedding party—including groom-to-be Gary, a widower, and his 11-year-old daughter—takes surfing lessons; the women in the group have a session with a Sex Woman. But it all goes on too long, and the humor can seem forced, reaching a low point when someone has sex with the vintage wedding car (you don’t want to know the details). Later, when two characters have a meet-cute in a hot tub, readers will guess exactly how the marriage plot resolves. Uneven but fitfully amusing.
