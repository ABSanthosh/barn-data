  "description": "This sing-along picture book adaptation takes “Giant Steps” by John Coltrane and fashions it into “Baby Steps,” adding lyrics that encourage little ones to move “first your right, then your left” to start their journey through life on their feet. Most of the pages feature a baby or toddler alongside parents, grandparents, and other trusted adults of varied ethnicities and genders whose voices are ostensibly speaking the song’s lyrics. (“Believe me when I tell you anything you put your mind to, you can achieve! You can be anything and anyone that you can dream to be!”) The last two pages of the book feature a brief biography of John Coltrane and a description of vocalese—a singing style that Harris uses to set lyrics to a section in his original piece—that will spark the curiosity of older children (and their adults). Young readers are sure to appreciate this debut’s energetic pace; it is light on text and big on feelings. The work takes on a multimedia dimension with the inclusion of a QR code that links to a music video for the song as performed by Harris’ Silly Jazz Band. Tran’s illustrations are rounded and colorful, winking at the piece’s origins with images of musical instruments on almost every page.",

  "text": "BEYOND MULBERRY GLEN by Millie Florence ; illustrated by Astrid Sheckels ‧ RELEASE DATE: Jan. 7, 2025 An absorbing fantasy centered on a resilient female protagonist facing growth, change, and self-empowerment. Awards \u0026 Accolades Our Verdict GET IT In Florence’s middle-grade fantasy novel, a young girl’s heart is tested in the face of an evil, spreading Darkness. Eleven-year-old Lydia, “freckle-cheeked and round-eyed, with hair the color of pine bark and fair skin,” is struggling with the knowledge that she has reached the age to apprentice as an herbalist. Lydia is reluctant to leave her beloved, magical Mulberry Glen and her cozy Housetree in the woods—she’ll miss Garder, the Glen’s respected philosopher; her fairy guardian Pit; her human friend Livy; and even the mischievous part-elf, part-imp, part-human twins Zale and Zamilla. But the twins go missing after hearing of a soul-sapping Darkness that has swallowed a forest and is creeping into minds and engulfing entire towns. They have secretly left to find a rare fruit that, it is said, will stop the Darkness if thrown into the heart of the mountain that rises out of the lethal forest. Lydia follows, determined to find the twins before they, too, fall victim to the Darkness. During her journey, accompanied by new friends, she gradually realizes that she herself has a dangerous role to play in the quest to stop the Darkness. In this well-crafted fantasy, Florence skillfully equates the physical manifestation of Darkness with the feelings of insecurity and powerlessness that Lydia first struggles with when thinking of leaving the Glen. Such negative thoughts grow more intrusive the closer she and her friends come to the Darkness—and to Lydia’s ultimate, powerfully rendered test of character, which leads to a satisfyingly realistic, not quite happily-ever-after ending. Highlights include a delightfully haunting, reality-shifting library and a deft sprinkling of Latin throughout the text; Pit’s pet name for Lydia is mea flosculus (“my little flower”). Fine-lined ink drawings introducing each chapter add a pleasing visual element to this well-grounded fairy tale. An absorbing fantasy centered on a resilient female protagonist facing growth, change, and self-empowerment.
