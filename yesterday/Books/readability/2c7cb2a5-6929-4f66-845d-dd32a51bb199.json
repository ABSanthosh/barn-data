  "text": "04 Jun 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Cybersecurity Checklist for Business Owners: Executive Battle Plan to Survive Cyber Threats? Most small businesses I’ve worked with over the years do not fully grasp the risks that cybercriminals pose to their livelihoods. I am not only concerned about the survival of my clients if a cyber attack occurs, but of all the small business owners that don’t have a security specialist available to walk them through the measures they need to stay protected. Today’s crimes don’t just take the cash from the register, but they can create magnitudes of liability no one is prepared for. One criminal accessing $1,000 worth of small business data can result in $10 million in lawsuit settlements. Hopefully, this book helps some owners and managers rethink their risk strategies. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Cybersecurity Checklist for Business Owners: Executive Battle Plan to Survive Cyber Threats, what would they be? Jaws theme song. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? These days, I only have time for business and technology non-fiction, but Catch-22 was awesome. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? The incident reports were both the most terrifying but also most important parts to write since they highlight the costs of inaction or inadequate preparation. They remind us of the skill of our adversaries and how comprehensive our defenses must be. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) Our cat, Posie, was definitely part of the writing process. Mostly, she insisted on frequent breaks, which can be helpful. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? “You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.” -Mae West If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? Cybersecurity isn’t only an information technology concern. It should be one of the primary concerns of all business owners, managers, and stakeholders.
