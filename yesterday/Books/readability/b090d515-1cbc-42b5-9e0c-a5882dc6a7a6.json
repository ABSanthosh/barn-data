View All posts by Community In response to the increase in attacks against trans rights, a group of crime fiction writers partnered with the Transgender Law Center to raise money to support them in their work to “champion the right of all transgender people and gender-nonconforming people to make their own choices and live freely, safely, and authentically.” More than 100 authors are participating, including Gillian Flynn, Roxane Gay, David Baldacci, Louise Penny, Walter Mosley, Charlaine Harris, Ann Cleeves, and many more. The items available to bid on include signed books (like Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn and nonfiction from Roxane Gay), character naming rights (Lisa Gardner), a diamond pendant, manuscript critique, book club appearances, and more. The auction has a goal of reaching $20,000, and the description says, “With your help, we aim to help the Transgender Law Center in their crucial mission. Together, we can navigate this difficult crossroads. Please join us as we step firmly toward justice, to fight on the right side of history—because trans rights are human rights.” The auction started March 26 and runs through April 1.
