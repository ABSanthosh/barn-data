  "description": "The story begins in the year 1831 of the Lucretian Era, a very early indication that this novel involves multiple layers of complex worldbuilding. Yamir Varro, the chief neuroscientist at Connectome Labs, has uploaded a copy ofhis brain into the android Y1, who narrates approximately a third of the novel in journallike “Logfiles.” Initially, Y1 longs for the company of Yamir’s wife, who refuses to interact with an android, and he regrets how he treated his college-aged son: “I missed so many of his milestones—losing his first baby tooth, playing his first game of stickball, shaving for the first time—because I was always at work.” Yamir is a pioneer, and his lab is on the verge of a major breakthrough, butthe world’s largest organized religion, The Temple, does not endorse his work. Olma, the Temple’s science and technology supervisor, is tasked with monitoring all emerging research that falls outside the faith’s strictures, and the novel closely follows her progress in its early stages. The tension soon ratchets up as Yamir’s lab is sold by Grady Leos, its owner, to the Temple and the androids are tasked with forced labor on a Martian settlement, as the Temple believes their leader, El, wants humans to eventually populate the red planet. What follows is a power struggle that pits the desires of Y1, Yamir and his family, and Olma against one another in an often thrilling narrative. The thoughtful, depressed android is an intriguing central character throughout. However, his logfiles are often overly and off-puttingly technical—“The repairs to the ASV3 aren’t going well. Zaltana replaced the leg destroyed by the explosion with one taken from the ASV2, but not every input aligns”—as well as occasionally repetitive. The close third-person narration following Yamir and Olma also relies on frequent scene-setting to remind readers of the stakes involved, which can, at times, become tiresome. Still, the central story and frequent twists will keep engaged readers hooked to the end.",

  "text": "DEVOLUTION by Max Brooks ‧ RELEASE DATE: June 16, 2020 A tasty, if not always tasteful, tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 253 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller Are we not men? We are—well, ask Bigfoot, as Brooks does in this delightful yarn, following on his bestseller World War Z(2006). A zombie apocalypse is one thing. A volcanic eruption is quite another, for, as the journalist who does a framing voice-over narration for Brooks’ latest puts it, when Mount Rainier popped its cork, “it was the psychological aspect, the hyperbole-fueled hysteria that had ended up killing the most people.” Maybe, but the sasquatches whom the volcano displaced contributed to the statistics, too, if only out of self-defense. Brooks places the epicenter of the Bigfoot war in a high-tech hideaway populated by the kind of people you might find in a Jurassic Park franchise: the schmo who doesn’t know how to do much of anything but tries anyway, the well-intentioned bleeding heart, the know-it-all intellectual who turns out to know the wrong things, the immigrant with a tough backstory and an instinct for survival. Indeed, the novel does double duty as a survival manual, packed full of good advice—for instance, try not to get wounded, for “injury turns you from a giver to a taker. Taking up our resources, our time to care for you.” Brooks presents a case for making room for Bigfoot in the world while peppering his narrative with timely social criticism about bad behavior on the human side of the conflict: The explosion of Rainier might have been better forecast had the president not slashed the budget of the U.S. Geological Survey, leading to “immediate suspension of the National Volcano Early Warning System,” and there’s always someone around looking to monetize the natural disaster and the sasquatch-y onslaught that follows. Brooks is a pro at building suspense even if it plays out in some rather spectacularly yucky episodes, one involving a short spear that takes its name from “the sucking sound of pulling it out of the dead man’s heart and lungs.” Grossness aside, it puts you right there on the scene. A tasty, if not always tasteful, tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy.
