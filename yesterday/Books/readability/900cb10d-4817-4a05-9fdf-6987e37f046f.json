  "description": "Returning to the U.K. to live with Granddad continues to bring new experiences. When Joy’s teacher goes on medical leave for a knee replacement, the new teacher, Mr. Suarez, surprises the class with his exuberance. Joy, who reads white, and best friend Benny, who’s Black, want to befriend new student Phoebe, but Joy worries that her efforts are coming across as annoying. The people in Joy’s inner circle have all sorts of new things going on in their lives—a new executive chef job for her dad, a new boyfriend for her sister (“and a new favorite word, which is PRIVACY”), a new love of gardening for Granddad, and new contact lenses for Benny to replace his glasses. To top it all off, Joy notices signs that her family might be moving again. Having put down roots, Joy is “quietly working on remembering the silver linings” of her old life, when she was home-schooled and traveled around to interesting new places. “Planet Joy,” as Claude terms it, is still as optimistic a place as ever; Joy still believes that life is “crammed full of upsides and silver linings and surprises.” This uplifting story explores bumps in the road without being patronizing. Joy’s comical and clever narration is delightful and is enhanced by charming illustrations.",

  "text": "ESCAPE FROM BAXTERS' BARN by Rebecca Bond ; illustrated by Rebecca Bond ‧ RELEASE DATE: July 7, 2015 Ironically, by choosing such a dramatic catalyst, the author weakens the adventure’s impact overall and leaves readers to... A group of talking farm animals catches wind of the farm owner’s intention to burn the barn (with them in it) for insurance money and hatches a plan to flee. Bond begins briskly—within the first 10 pages, barn cat Burdock has overheard Dewey Baxter’s nefarious plan, and by Page 17, all of the farm animals have been introduced and Burdock is sharing the terrifying news. Grady, Dewey’s (ever-so-slightly) more principled brother, refuses to go along, but instead of standing his ground, he simply disappears. This leaves the animals to fend for themselves. They do so by relying on their individual strengths and one another. Their talents and personalities match their species, bringing an element of realism to balance the fantasy elements. However, nothing can truly compensate for the bland horror of the premise. Not the growing sense of family among the animals, the serendipitous intervention of an unknown inhabitant of the barn, nor the convenient discovery of an alternate home. Meanwhile, Bond’s black-and-white drawings, justly compared to those of Garth Williams, amplify the sense of dissonance. Charming vignettes and single- and double-page illustrations create a pastoral world into which the threat of large-scale violence comes as a shock. Ironically, by choosing such a dramatic catalyst, the author weakens the adventure’s impact overall and leaves readers to ponder the awkward coincidences that propel the plot.
