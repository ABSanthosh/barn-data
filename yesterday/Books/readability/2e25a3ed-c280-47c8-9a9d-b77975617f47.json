  "description": "Justyce Dreadmiller, the self-made owner-manager of the boutique grocery store Mildred’s Market, has long suffered the routine shoplifting of “pouting young nymphet” Yvette Cartier. Every few days, the entitled, beautiful Yvette pilfers several high-end items—perfumes, cosmetics, lubricants, and the like—from Justyce’s shelves. Justyce has just purchased a Japanese-made novelty conveyor belt (the eponymous At-Your-Beck Felicity Conveyor) to help set the Market apart, a substantial investment that makes Yvette’s shoplifting increasingly hard on his bottom line. When Yvette purloins $700 worth of inventory in a single day, he knows he must do something to put her in her place. Justyce believes in “solving his own problems in his own ways, on his own initiative, and at his own convenience, in as straightforward a manner as was practicable,” an approach that has, in the past, meant leaving his high school bully drugged and castrated in a swamp. For Yvette, the plan is slightly less grisly: He will simply humiliate her in the most sadistic manner imaginable. For that, he will need, among other things, the help of his seductive son, an aphrodisiacal ointment that delays climax, and a few novel augmentations of the At-Your-Beck Felicity Conveyor. Landon’s prose is nearly Joycean in its verbosity, which, in addition to slowing down the novel’s pace, creates an ironic friction with the ribald subject matter. Here, the author describes Yvette’s magnetic effect on men: “Gentlemen from all walks of life would ogle our subdebutante everywhither she set her pretty young feet and, to boost her libidinal ego, she would play little games with these poor sitting ducks by coyly making goo-goo eyes at the throbbing love muscles inside their trousers.” The book builds to a preposterous (and literal) climax—aided by what amounts to a Rube Goldberg machine composed of sex toys—that is almost too abstracted to either scintillate or offend. Readers who enjoy both high postmodernism and BDSM will have fun with this one.",

  "text": "IT STARTS WITH US by Colleen Hoover ‧ RELEASE DATE: Oct. 18, 2022 Through palpable tension balanced with glimmers of hope, Hoover beautifully captures the heartbreak and joy of starting over. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 280 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller The sequel to It Ends With Us (2016) shows the aftermath of domestic violence through the eyes of a single mother. Lily Bloom is still running a flower shop; her abusive ex-husband, Ryle Kincaid, is still a surgeon. But now they’re co-parenting a daughter, Emerson, who's almost a year old. Lily won’t send Emerson to her father’s house overnight until she’s old enough to talk—“So she can tell me if something happens”—but she doesn’t want to fight for full custody lest it become an expensive legal drama or, worse, a physical fight. When Lily runs into Atlas Corrigan, a childhood friend who also came from an abusive family, she hopes their friendship can blossom into love. (For new readers, their history unfolds in heartfelt diary entries that Lily addresses to Finding Nemo star Ellen DeGeneres as she considers how Atlas was a calming presence during her turbulent childhood.) Atlas, who is single and running a restaurant, feels the same way. But even though she’s divorced, Lily isn’t exactly free. Behind Ryle’s veneer of civility are his jealousy and resentment. Lily has to plan her dates carefully to avoid a confrontation. Meanwhile, Atlas’ mother returns with shocking news. In between, Lily and Atlas steal away for romantic moments that are even sweeter for their authenticity as Lily struggles with child care, breastfeeding, and running a business while trying to find time for herself. Through palpable tension balanced with glimmers of hope, Hoover beautifully captures the heartbreak and joy of starting over.
