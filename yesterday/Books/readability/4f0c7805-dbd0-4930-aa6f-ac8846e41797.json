  "text": "Publisher Doubleday just announced that a new novel by Dan Brown will be coming this September. Its title is The Secrets of Secrets, and it will be Brown’s first Robert Langdon series book since 2017’s Origin. Three books from the Robert Langdon series—The Da Vince Code, Angels \u0026 Demons, and Inferno—have been adapted into Tom Hanks-starring, Ron Howard-directed movies. In them, the titular Robert Langdon is a world-renowned Harvard symbologist who traverses the world (mainly Europe and the US), deciphering codes and solving ancient mysteries. In The Secrets of Secrets, Langdon travels to Prague to attend a lecture by noetic scientist Katherine Solomon, who is also his partner. Her latest book promises to upend long-held belifs surrounding human consciousness, but then a murder turns things upside down, and Katherine goes missing. On top of all that, Langdon becomes the target of a powerful organization. The Secrets of Secrets is out on September 9, 2025. To learn more, visit Penguin Random House.
