  "text": "06 Nov 2024 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Axle (WAR BROTHERS MC Book 1)? It is the first instalment of the series, but the fourth book released. I had so many readers wanting Axle and Elena’s story, so I went back and wrote it. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Axle (WAR BROTHERS MC Book 1), what would they be? “Wicked Game” by Grace Carter, “The Death of Peace of Mind” by Bad Omens, “I Knew You Were Trouble” by Taylor Swift, “Sexy and I Know It” by  LMFAO, and “Spine” by WesGhost. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I don’t have a favorite – I like all. I mainly write Motorcycle Club romance. What books are on your TBR pile right now? I’d like to get stuck into Legacy of Gods by Rina Kent. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? Elena’s first encounter with Axle, as well as the epilogue. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) No, but caffeine is a must. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Treat others how I would like to be treated. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? Everyone deserves love. Buy The Book Sign up for our email and we’ll send you the best new books in your favorite genres weekly. meghan Recommended Posts",
