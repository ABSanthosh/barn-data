We batted really badly as a batting unit. \"The bowlers did really well on this surface. We were reckless - we should take full responsibility as a batting unit. It was an easy chase for us.\"Punjab looked to have little chance at halfway after their own collapse from 39-0 to 111 all out in 15.3 overs. Openers Prabhsimran Singh and Priyansh Arya made 30 and 22 respectively as seamer Harshit Rana took 3-25.Punjab are now fourth but join four other sides on eight points at the top of the table, while KKR are sixth.",
