  "text": "NewsPriyansh Arya gets to No. 9 and Prabhsimran Singh to No. 11 on IPL 2025 Orange Cap table after half-centuries against KKRThe Orange Cap tablePriyansh Arya, in his debut IPL season and scoring consistently and fast at the top of the order for PBKS, became the tenth batter to pass 300 runs this season, his 69 in 35 balls taking his tally to 323 from nine innings. That put him at No. 10 as well. Prabhsimran Singh did even better than his opening partner, with 83 in 49 balls, his best this season, and that took him up to 12th, with 292 runs, Shubman Gill's 305 separating the pair.More than what happened on Saturday, though, is what could happen on Sunday. Mumbai Indians (MI) play Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in the afternoon and Delhi Capitals (DC) take on Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) later.That means all of Virat Kohli (No. 2 with 392 runs), Nicholas Pooran (No. 3 with 377 runs), Suryakumar Yadav (No. 4 with 373 runs), Mitchell Marsh (No. 7 with 344 runs), Aiden Markram (No. 8 with 326 runs) and KL Rahul (No. 9 with 323 runs) will be in action. Good hands by a couple of them and/or failures for one or two players could throw the Orange Cap table into a tizzy. And when B Sai Sudharsan, the table-topper, plays for Gujarat Titans (GT) against Rajasthan Royals (RR) on Monday, he will know if he still has the cap or has to earn it back.The Purple Cap tableAfter many days of clusters of ten, 11 and 12 wicket-takers, things changed over the past few days, with Prasidh Krishna (GT) first and then Josh Hazlewood (RCB) breaking away from the pack to get to the top of the table with 16 wickets apiece, followed by Noor Ahmad of Chennai Super Kings (CSK) with 14 and Harshal Patel of Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) with 13 wickets. Seven bowlers are below them on 12, and after KKR vs PBKS, Varun Chakravarthy has joined the group - now of five - with 11 wickets.Like with the Orange Cap scrap, things could change on the Purple Cap table after Sunday too, with MI vs LSG featuring Hardik Pandya and Shardul Thakur (both on 12 wickets) and DC vs RCB featuring Kuldeep Yadav and Krunal Pandya (12 each) as well as Mitchell Starc (11 wickets).You might also want to take a look at the following tables.
