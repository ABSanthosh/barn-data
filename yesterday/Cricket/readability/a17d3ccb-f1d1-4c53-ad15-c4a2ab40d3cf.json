The 61-year-old, affectionately nicknamed “Syd”, was diagnosed with motor neurone disease last year.David Lawrence during England’s Test with Sri Lanka at Lord’s in 1988. Photograph: PA Images/AlamyLawrence said: “It is an incredibly proud moment to have been awarded an MBE in the King’s birthday honours. It is not something I ever thought would sit after my name, but I am absolutely delighted that it will do so for however long I am here and will be a part of my legacy when I am gone.“As a proud Gloucester man who achieved his dream to play for England on the cricket field, it means a great deal to me and to my family who have supported me with all their love during some difficult times. I have always put my heart and soul into any challenge I have faced and that is how I have approached things since my diagnosis with motor neurone disease. With awareness and funds for research, we can make a positive difference for those who will need it in the future.”Another former England pace bowler, Devon Malcolm, has been made an OBE while Steven Davies, who in 2011 became the first male international cricketer to come out as gay, has been made an MBE.There is further recognition for the two-time Olympic triathlon champion Alistair Brownlee, who has become an OBE, and Rachel Daly, one of the stars of the England women’s football team that won the European Championship on home soil in 2022, who has been made an MBE.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionFrank Rothwell, the owner of Oldham, has become an OBE for services to dementia research.Monica Vaughan, a 10-time Paralympic swimming gold medallist, becomes an OBE while Andy Lapthorne, a 18-time grand slam champion in wheelchair tennis, has been made an MBE.
