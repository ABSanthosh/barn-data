On Saturday, he blitzed England to an eight-wicket win against West Indies.It’s a decision he may live to regret from a personal perspective, but not from a professional one, as he extended his remarkable T20 record against West Indies and gave England victory. In his last five matches against this opposition, he has made three centuries and scored 456 runs at an average of 228.For all the nuances of Test and one-day international cricket, there are few sporting events more fun than a T20 at Kensington Oval on a Saturday night. An equal mix of tourists and locals in the crowd, you sip on a rum and then dodge a six as it flies past your head. A new way of blending pleasure and pain.On the surface, England’s victory may look routine, but it was the result of a match played at full throttle from beginning to end. In the opening four overs, Saqib Mahmood had reduced the Windies to 18 for three, only for the home team to commit to carnage and blast their way out of trouble.For every six that was struck, a wicket would fall. It was a mentality best exhibited by the home No 10 Gudakesh Motie, who arrived at the crease at 117 for eight with more than five overs to go and launched his first two balls for six.All of Andre Russell, Nicholas Pooran and Akeal Hosein were back for the home team, with Russell at one stage launching a ball over the pavilion and into the road as a thrilling first innings dramatically swung in favour of each team.The fireworks were not reserved solely for the pitch, either. For much of the last 24 hours in Barbados, torrential rain had fallen and halfway through Reece Topley’s third over, it arrived again, but did not stop play.Topley, who has a long history of serious injuries, bowled one more ball, slipped and fell. As he lay on the ground in pain, the covers finally came on. After the restart, he bowled a single delivery that was struck for six and left the pitch immediately in clear discomfort. As he walked up the changing room stairs, he grabbed a nearby plastic chair and smashed it over the bannister in frustration.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionQuick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Salt was ably supported by Jacob Bethell, who made his first T20i half-century, as England’s two Bajan boys did the business in their hometown with plenty of friends and family in the stand.
