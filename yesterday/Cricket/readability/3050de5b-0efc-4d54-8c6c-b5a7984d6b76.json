  "text": "Uncapped England leg-spinner Jafer Chohan will return home from England’s ongoing white-ball tour of the West Indies to manage his workload. Chohan, 22, made history last month after being selected in England’s white-ball squad for their Caribbean tour, becoming the first graduate of the South Asian Cricket Academy to be selected for England. However, the Yorkshire wrist spinner will have to wait for his international debut as he will return home midway through the tour to manage his workload before the upcoming Lions tour of South Africa. In addition to the Lions series, Chohan will play for the Sydney Sixers in the 2024-25 BBL, starting from December 15. \"Leg-spinner Jafer Chohan will return home from the England Men’s white-ball tour of the Caribbean today. The decision has been made to manage his workload and help him prepare for the upcoming England Lions tour of South Africa and his Big Bash League stint with Sydney Sixers,\" confirmed ECB in a statement. \"Chohan was last month selected in a 19-player England Lions squad that will tour South Africa from November 20 until December 14, and as previously announced Chohan will join for part of the tour due to his Big Bash League commitments in Australia.\" — Wisden India (@WisdenIndia) November 11, 2024 Despite Chohan’s absence, England still have plenty of depth in their spin reserves with Rehan Ahmed available as a backup in addition to Liam Livingstone, Jacob Bethell, Will Jacks and Dan Mousley in the playing XI. Having lost the ODIs, England currently lead the T20I series 2-0, with three games yet to be played. After Phil Salt starred with 103 not out in the curtain-raiser, captain Jos Buttler's 45-ball 83 proved to be decisive in the second match.
