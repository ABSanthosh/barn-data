He had to work incredibly hard to get back. As the driven athlete he is, he’s all in when he does something. He had to put in a lot of graft and subconsciously it can … not cloud things, but maybe you’re not quite as screwed down as you can be in terms of decision-making. He’s disappointed but he’s our skipper and we know he’s a tough bugger. He’ll make sure he’ll come back and it’s our job to make sure we wrap our arms around him and help him along the way.”McCullum said England’s defeat had been down to a lack of a killer instinct, insisting his team put themselves in positions to win both of the last two Tests. “We had our chances. Many times in the last two Tests you would argue we were in front of the game and we let that slip. We weren’t able to sustain pressure and transfer pressure back on to them. When Pakistan got a sniff they were very good, and we weren’t able to handle that.Ben Stokes walks off after being dismissed on day one of the third Test in Rawalpindi.

On balance that’s OK but if we’re being honest with ourselves we’ve had opportunities to put up a better record than that, so it’s disappointing. You don’t get too many opportunities to nail down big series in the subcontinent. We’ve had those chances and we weren’t quite good enough.”McCullum accepted that “in the end they were much better than us in these conditions”.
