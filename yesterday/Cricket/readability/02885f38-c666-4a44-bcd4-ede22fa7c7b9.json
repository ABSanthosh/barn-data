There are three games to play, three chances of a win.\"Wood, 35, has played in both matches of the series so far after being sidelined since August with a stress fracture in his elbow.In the 5.5 overs he has bowled across the series, Wood has taken one wicket and leaked runs at an economy of 8.83 per over.\"I've felt a little bit 'hitty-missy',\" he said. \"I've done a couple of good things, it's great that my pace is up there, but maybe my accuracy at time hasn't been quite where I wanted it. \"When I haven't played since August, that's pretty much expected. Hopefully the more I play, the better I get.\"England team: Ben Duckett, Phil Salt (wicketkeeper), Jos Buttler (captain), Harry Brook, Liam Livingstone, Jamie Smith, Jamie Overton, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood.",
