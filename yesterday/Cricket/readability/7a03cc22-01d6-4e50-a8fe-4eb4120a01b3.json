The play-offs begin on 29 May and the final is on 3 June.Wicketkeeper Buttler will travel to India for the conclusion of the group stage before returning to England for the first ODI on 29 May.All-rounders Jacob Bethell and Will Jacks, who play for Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Mumbai Indians respectively, are expected to do the same.Jofra Archer and Jamie Overton, the two other IPL players in England's ODI squad, are not expected to return to India as their franchises cannot qualify for the play-offs.England play West Indies in three ODIs before a three-match T20 series starts on 6 June.The Titans, who are top of the IPL with three matches left, need only one win to guarantee a play-off spot.Sri Lanka batter Kusal Mendis will replace Buttler after he departs India on 26 May.Second-placed Royal Challengers also need to win one of their three remaining matches to qualify.England all-rounder Liam Livingstone and wicketkeeper Phil Salt have also returned to RCB for the IPL's restart.Livingstone has been dropped by England and Salt features only in the T20 squad.The ODI series is England's first since Harry Brook replaced Jos Buttler as captain.",
