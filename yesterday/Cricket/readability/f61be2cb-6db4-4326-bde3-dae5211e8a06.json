  "text": "England captain Ben Stokes will be \"hurting\" after the series defeat in Pakistan, says coach Brendon McCullum.The tourists were spun out in the second and third Tests to lose 2-1, the first time they have been beaten in a three-match series after going 1-0 up.Stokes missed the first Test at the end of two months out with a hamstring injury, then managed 53 runs in four innings and went wicketless in the 10 overs he bowled.\"He's disappointed but he's our skipper and we know he's tough,\" said McCullum.\"He'll make sure he'll come back. It's our job to make sure we wrap our arms around him and help him along the way.\"Stokes has endured a stop-start couple of years with his fitness. For much of 2023 his bowling was hampered by a long-term left knee problem.He had surgery in November that year and was back to playing a full role as an all-rounder in this year's home summer, only to injure his hamstring playing in The Hundred in August.The 33-year-old missed four Tests, including the series opener in Pakistan, which the tourists won.He returned for the second - a defeat on a recycled pitch in Multan - then particularly struggled in the series decider in Rawalpindi.Stokes scored 15 runs in two innings and did not bowl. On the second afternoon, Stokes' captaincy was unusually passive as Saud Shakeel compiled a century to give Pakistan control.In England's second innings, Stokes was bizarrely lbw playing no shot to spinner Noman Ali.England were ultimately skittled for 112, their lowest total in Pakistan, setting the hosts towards a nine-wicket win.\"He is disappointed, naturally,\" said McCullum. \"We all know how competitive and driven the skipper is. He'll be hurting right now with how the series has unfolded.\"That injury was quite significant. He had to put in a lot of graft and subconsciously maybe you're not quite as screwed down as you can be in terms of decision-making. That's natural.\"England have a short turnaround to their next tour, a three-Test series in New Zealand beginning at the end of November.A squad is expected to be announced in the coming days, with few changes anticipated.Leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed is likely to make way, possibly for a batter or wicketkeeper to cover for Jamie Smith, who will miss part or all of the tour for the birth of his first child.The first Test is in Christchurch, the city where Stokes was born before moving to the UK at the age of 12.\"He'll be better for the run, no doubt,\" said McCullum, himself a New Zealander.\"It will be a couple of weeks off, freshen up and back to conditions which are a bit more similar to England. It's another opportunity for us.\"",
