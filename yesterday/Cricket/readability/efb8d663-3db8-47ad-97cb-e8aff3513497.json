Rohit's outing in front of the jam-packed crowd at the Wankhede Stadium was met with a bitter end at the hands of Madhya Pradesh left-armer Arshad Khan.

In 35 innings, Rohit has faced 182 deliveries, mustered up 268 runs at a strike rate of 147.25. However, he has lost his precious wicket 12 times at an average of 7.65.Overall, Rohit has had a season of performances in patches in the cash-rich league. In 11 matches, Rohit has 300 runs under his belt at an average of 30.00 while striking at 152.28, including three half-centuries.After Rohit's dismissal, MI tried to stitch up a comeback, but Gujarat clobbered Mumbai in front of the wave of blue.
