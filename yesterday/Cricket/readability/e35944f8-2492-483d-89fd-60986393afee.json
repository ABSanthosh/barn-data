Photograph: Randy Brooks/AFP/Getty ImagesStarc’s 15-ball five-wicket haul marked the fastest by any bowler in Test history, eclipsing the previous record of 19 from Ernie Toshack, Stuart Broad and Boland.The 35-year-old also became the second man to take three wickets in the opening over of an innings, striking when he had John Campbell caught behind first ball.He then trapped Kevlon Anderson when the right hander left a ball that tailed in at him, before bowling Brandon King with the last delivery of the over.Starc’s assault carried into his third over, claiming his 400th Test scalp with another ball that swung into Mikyle Louis’ back pad. Shai Hope followed two balls later, again trapped lbw.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionAt that point Starc had figures of 5 for 2, with the only runs off him coming via the outside edge of Hope’s bat and through the slips.Starc could have had a sixth victim, had Sam Konstas not grassed two chances at third slip to remove Alzarri Joseph either side of tea. But that opened the door for Boland’s hat-trick.Called in for Nathan Lyon, the Victorian edged off Justin Greaves, had Shamar Joseph lbw and bowled Jomel Warrican in consecutive balls.The hat-trick marked Australia’s first in a Test since Peter Siddle in the 2010-11 Ashes.“I was a bit nervous bowling that last ball,” Boland admitted. “It’s an amazing feeling. Starcy set us up there, and I have never been involved in a game where we bowled a team out for 27.”In all, four of West Indies’ top five were dismissed for ducks, while they only avoided being all out for 26 via a misfield from Konstas at the end.Australia’s record showing came after they appeared in danger of dropping the Test, when bowled out for 121 in their second innings courtesy of 5-27 from Alzarri Joseph.“It’s heartbreaking to be in a position like that, where we could have won the game and come out and have that poor batting display,” West Indies captain Roston Chase said.",
