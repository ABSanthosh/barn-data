Bethell, a stylish left-hander who plays for Warwickshire, is yet to score a century at first-class level and will be the first batter to make his England debut without doing so since Mike Gatting in 1978.Bethell moved to England on a scholarship at Rugby School aged 14 and is considered a generational talent. He has already made international debuts in one-day and Twenty20 cricket this year and was recently signed on a £246,000 deal to play for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the next edition of the Indian Premier League. This first Test cap, announced as England trained at Hagley Oval two days before the series opener, which starts on Wednesday evening UK time, completes the set.Coming in at first drop is a huge ask for such an inexperienced cricketer who has never batted there for Warwickshire in the County Championship but, with Pope saddled with the burden of keeping, needs must. That said, it is not as if Joe Root could not have moved up one slot given his previous experience there.Pope’s switch in roles follows Cox’s cruel injury in Queenstown on Sunday, having initially been down to deputise for Jamie Smith (paternity leave) only to then sustain a fractured thumb in the nets. Ollie Robinson, the Durham wicketkeeper, is expected to fly to New Zealand but was not officially on standby and has been in the process of getting his passport renewed.Robinson is yet to be officially called up but should arrive in time for the second Test in Wellington once the paperwork is sorted.
