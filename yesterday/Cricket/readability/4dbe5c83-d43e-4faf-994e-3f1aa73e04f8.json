The selectors value players getting experience at home Test venues. It was part of the reason Nathan McSweeney got the nod at the start of the Border-Gavaskar series, as Konstas has not played at either the Gabba or Adelaide Oval.Australia will have adequate concussion substitutes in Konstas' absence, with 15 remaining in the squad as well as development player Tanveer Sangha.The tour was Konstas' first with the Australian squad to the subcontinent, but he previously attended development camps in Chennai and Sri Lanka.He may have an additional opportunity to hone his skills against spin with an Australia A tour of India in the works for later in 2025.After his famous start to life as a Test player, the Sri Lanka tour may have shaped as underwhelming for Konstas, who missed selection and was then struck down by a stomach bug.But Head said Konstas would have learnt from the touring experience.\"Sam's a big part of where we're going, there's no doubt about it,\" Head said. \"Disappointed that he missed out on the first Test but great for him to be here, great for him to be experiencing conditions.\"Head expected Konstas would return to the top of the batting order when Australia travelled to England for the World Test Championship Final against South Africa in June.\"Most likely I'll go back in the middle order and Sam will open,\" Head said.",
