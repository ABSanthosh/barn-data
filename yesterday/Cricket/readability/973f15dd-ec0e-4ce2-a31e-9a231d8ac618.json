Congratulations England – ‘A new dawn has broken has it not?’ and all that. Charlotte Edwards will be pretty happy with what she saw this evening. The series continues on Friday down in Hove. Rob Smyth will be your guide for that and we’ll be back in the morning for the start of the Test match summer.Thanks for your company, goodnight!England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt: Happy days! I didn’t have to do anything! The important thing was taking wickets through the innings, Hayley is such a big player for them but stemming the runs by taking wickets was our method. The chase looked calm and calculated and was brilliant to watch.” Hayley Matthews is named Player of the Match… The West Indies skipper was on the losing side but she did score 100 not out from just 67 balls. Without her there would barely have been any match to speak of. It was a good day for myself but unfortunate not to get the win. I felt we were 15-20 runs short and we weren’t able to build many partnerships. It’s hard to defend 150… It’s about picking ourselves up and starting again (in the next match at Hove).” England win by 8 wickets (with 21 balls remaining)That’s a stylish win for England. Sophie Dunkley hits the winning runs through the covers and the Charlotte Edwards/Nat Sciver-Brunt regime gets off to the perfect start.16th over: England 140-2 (Dunkley 77, Knight 38) Wonderful stuff from Dunkley! She knows exactly where the gaps are and reverse-sweeps for four. And again, a carbon copy! A clip for two into midwicket takes Dunkley to her highest T20I score. She’d love a red inker here. Twelve off the over and just seven needed for England. I shall not be dining on Pentium processor.15th over: England 128-2 (Dunkley 66, Knight 37) Zaida James into the attack and England looking to get this done in a hurry now. Dunkley biffs down the ground and Knight gets in on the action with a lofted drive over the infield for four more. High class from Knight the footsoldier – a cut for four with nifty footwork and deft hands.England need 19 more runs to get their summer and new era off to a winning start. If they mess it up from here I’ll eat this laptop.14th over: England 114-2 (Dunkley 66, Knight 23) Hayley Matthews brings herself back on, do or die for her side now. She burns a review on a spurious lbw shout on Dunkley and then has her… DROPPED! Alleyne can’t hold the catch running in and diving forward from long-on. Another tough one but West Indies need to cling on to the half chances.13th over: England 108-2 (Dunkley 61, Knight 22) Alleyne comits the cardinal sin and oversteps the front line. Free hit incoming… Dunkley loses her shape and can only loft into the deep for a single. Two wides in the over too, West Indies can’t afford to gift extras to England, they are cantering as it is. Nine runs off an over that seemed to take an age. England need 39 from 42 balls. I imagine they are desperate to get this done and dusted so they can watch the end of the Europa league final. Ahem.12th over: England 99-2 (Dunkley 59, Knight 18) Dunkley is ticking now! She trots down and drives Ramharack for four through the covers. Four singles then follow with ease. West Indies need to break this partnership pronto.11th over: England 91-2 (Dunkley 53, Knight 16) Dunkley has been on the pickle juice or some-such, she comes out after drinks and carves for four to bring up a classy fifty. Afy Fletcher is whipped for two and then a single brings Knight on strike. Gah – poor ball – dragged down and hoicked for four more by Knight.England's Sophia Dunkley gives the ball a thwack on her way to her half century. Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/Reuters10th over: England 80-2 (Dunkley 46, Knight 12) Krishma Ramharack into the attack, she twirls it down with her cap on a la her captain. Three singles before Knight opens the shoulders and hits the ball on the bounce into the sponge.Time for a drink and England have the match in their hands. 67 needed from 60 balls.9th over: England 73-2 (Dunkley 44, Knight 7) A scamper and a scurry, England tick over and take seven off Afy Fletcher.The sun sets during at The Spitfire Ground, Canterbury. Photograph: Ben Whitley/PA8th over: England 66-2 (Dunkley 39, Knight 5) Hayley Matthews brings herself back on, she wants to prise this game open with the ball. Knight and Dunkley rotate strike well to keep the squeeze at bay.7th over: England 60-2 (Dunkley 35, Knight 4) Heather Knight out in the middle and for the first time in eight years she doesn’t have the captain’s armband on. She starts perkily, picking up a couple of twos through the off side. A few more quick wickets might see England wobbling.WICKET! Nat Sciver-Brunt c †Mangru b Fletcher 0 (England 56-2)There is a spike and NSB has to drag herself off!West Indies' Mandy Mangru celebrates after taking a catch to dismiss England's Nat Sciver-Brunt off the bowling of Afy Fletcher. Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersEngland’s new captain arrives in the middle. Afy Fletcher comes on to fizz down some leg-spin. Lovely late cut from Dunkley for four. She’s looked in great nick this evening. Now then, Sciver-Brunt attempts a sweep and West Indies think she might have a tickle on it…WICKET! Danni Wyatt-Hodge b Zaida James 17 (England 51-1)Dunkley launches James for four and clips through leg for a second boundary. A single brings Wyatt-Hodge on strike. Gone! The bowler zips one down the leg side and Wyatt-Hodge is unlucky as the ball canons off her back pad and onto the stumps. West Indies needed that.6th over: England 51-1 (Dunkley 30, Sciver-Brunt 0)Zaida James of West Indies celebrates taking the wicket of Danni Wyatt-Hodge of England. Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images5th over: England 42-0 (Wyatt-Hodge 17, Dunkley 21) Cherry-Ann Fraser into the attack. She’s worked for four singles before Wyatt-Hodge smears her for four off the final ball, short and wide and lashed to the boundary.4th over: England 34-0 (Wyatt-Hodge 11, Dunkley 19) Hayley Matthew’s replaces Glasgow. Is she going to get a stack of wickets too? Not just yet – Dunkley sweeps her for four and England pick off four additional singles easily enough.3rd over: England 26-0 (Wyatt-Hodge 9, Dunkley 13) James continues and skids one through Wyatt-Hodge and the ball shoots away for four behind the keeper. Shot! After looking slightly scrappy Wyatt-Hodge finds her timing and lofts square for four. England are away.2nd over: England 14-0 (Wyatt-Hodge 2, Dunkley 12) Jannillea Glasgow has a chance to atone for her butterfingers, she’s sharing the new nut. Sophia Dunkley has been back to somewhere near her best in domestic cricket recently, can she rediscover her mojo in England colours? The signs are good – she drills three fours through the covers in imperious fashion!1st over: England 1-0 (Wyatt-Hodge 1, Dunkley 0) Zaida James gets things underway with the ball and nearly snaffles Wyatt-Hodge right away but the lofted drive slips through the fingers at of Jannillea Glasgow in the covers! Tricky but should have been taken, an early let off for England. Just one off the first over.Here come Wyatt-Hodge and Dunkley, can England make light work of this total? Let’s find out!Danni Wyatt-Hodge takes to the field. Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty ImagesEngland’s men get their Test summer started tomorrow. I suppose it would be terribly rude not to plug today’s Spin: \"Those Thursday starts are a pain, eh? What with all that annoying “work” getting in the way and a manager/team who inexplicably don’t seem to be bothered about whether Sam Cook will jag the new Dukes and be quick enough on his Test debut or even whether Zak Crawley’s Teflon coating might finally wear through? Where do these people get off organising meetings for 11am? No matter, you’ve got your methods, your strategies. You’ve been in good form during the first months of the County Championship, honing your skills for the first Test. You do what the teenagers do and surreptitiously use an ear bud so you can tune in to Test Match Special on the sly. Do not – repeat NOT – start tapping your tea mug with your teaspoon when Soul Limbo kicks in, have some self-control. Play the long game. It’s Test cricket for God’s sake, show some grit and determination! Wait, who are you calling old-fashioned? Open up your tabs on your desktop. Go on, fire up that trusty out-of-date spreadsheet ready to cover the over-by-over and live text alerts with the flick of a shortcut key should someone walk past. Concentrate. Use your process. “Be where your mouse is.” This thing could be over in an instant. Get your head down. Take each ball at a time.” England will need to knock off 146 to get their new era off to a winning start, you’d take that I reckon. Then again, take away Matthews’ runs and they’d be chasing just 46!West Indies score 146-7And a century for Hayley Matthews! Off the final ball of the innings too. She’s carried her side on her back this evening with over two thirds of their runs coming off her blade. That’s her third T20I ton and she punished a loose final over from Lauren Bell, twelve runs off the final over and a tricksy total to defend.West Indies’ Hayley Matthews thwacks the ball on her way to a century. Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAAnd celebrates said feat. Photograph: Ben Whitley/PA19th over: West Indies 134-7 (Matthews 89, Fraser 0) Cherry-Ann Fraser is the new batter and blocks out a dot. Matthews will be on strike for the final over. Lauren Bell to bowl it, full of confidence after that catch.WICKET! Mandy Mangru c Bell b Smith 17 (West Indies 134-7)Wonderful catch by Lauren Bell at fine leg! Uses her height and fast reflexes to pluck the ball out of the evening sun with both hands. Mangru’s cameo comes to an end.18th over: West Indies 128-6 (Matthews 88, Mangru 12) The century is still in for Hayley Matthews! She carves Wong through point for four and then spots the slower ball off the final ball of the over, dispatching over midwicket for another boundary. Mangru is playing a clever hand too, making sure she gets her captain on strike as much as possible. Wong returns with figures of 1-35. Decent.17th over: West Indies 119-6 (Matthews 80, Mangru 11) Bell comes back to bowl the death overs and is crashed through the covers by Matthews. That’s all for boundaries off the over though as Matthews is kept honest by a nippy bouncer to finish the over. Three to go, what sort of score can Matthews haul her side to here? 150 might be a tricky chase under lights.16th over: West Indies 111-6 (Matthews 74, Mangru 9) Impressive figures for Em Arlott on dayboo – she finishes her four overs with 1-28.15th over: West Indies 105-5 (Matthews 71, Mangru 6) Matthews is keeping her side alive in the match with consecutive fours off Wong. The bowler comes back with a 70mph yorker. Hundred up for West Indies, they owe a lot to their skipper.14th over: West Indies 95-5 (Matthews 62, Mangru 5) Mandy Mangru joins Matthews and strokes a four through cover to get off the mark in style. England trying to starve Matthews of the strike, without her runs this scorecard makes for grim reading for West Indies.WICKET! Jannillea Glasgow run out (Smith/Dean) 4 (West Indies 86-6)Hayley Matthews barbecues her partner in trying to come back for two to keep strike. England gifted another!13th over: West Indies 82-5 (Matthews 55, Glasgow 4) Jannillea Glasgow is the new batter and she gets off the mark with a nick through the vacant second slip region! Arlott might ask for another catcher… two dots to finish the over. England on top at the moment.WICKET! Aaliyah Alleyne c Nat Sciver-Brunt b Arlott 2 (West Indies 78-5)A first international wicket for Em Arlott! Back of a length and swatted tamely into the ring. Lovely moment in dappled evening sunshine for the debutant.England's Emily Arlott celebrates with Charlie Dean after taking the wicket of West Indies' Aaliyah Alleyne. Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersWICKET! Shabika Gajnabi c Nat Sciver-Brunt b Wong 11 (West Indies 71-4)A back of the hand slower ball from Wong does the trick and breaks the partnership! Gajnabi was too early on the shot and she plinked a catch to England’s captain at midwicket. Clever bowling from Wong.12th over: West Indies 75-3 (Matthews 52, Alleyne 0) Izzy Wong is hacked baseball style down the ground by Gajnabi. Shades of KP against Brett Lee at the Oval in 2005.11th over: West Indies 64-3 (Matthews 52, Gajnabi 6) Linsey Smith peels off a maiden over, worth its weight in gooooold.10th over: West Indies 64-3 (Matthews 52, Gajnabi 6) Arlott is panned away over mid-on for four by Matthews and then swept for two more. A single brings up the half century for Hayley Matthews, she’s looking dangerous but West Indies haven’t got that many on the board at the half way stage.9th over: West Indies 54-3 (Matthews 43, Gajnabi 5) Charlie Dean rattles through a quick over for just three runs. England have been sharp in the field so far. Spindly shadows stretch across the outfield in Canterbury, it looks a lovely early summer’s evening there now.8th over: West Indies 51-3 (Matthews 41, Gajnabi 4) Shabika Gajnabi gets off the mark with something of a spawny shot to a Wong short ball, a gloved deflection sees the ball beat Jones and run away for four.WICKET! Realeanna Grimmond run out (Nat Sciver-Brunt/Jones) 4 (West Indies 46-3)A complete brain fade from Grimmond who inexplicably wanders out of her crease as the throw from Sciver-Brunt came in to Amy Jones! Can only think she thought over had been called but it definitely hadn’t. Dopey cricket that does not look good on the replay for Grimmond. England have been gifted another!Issy Wong is summoned for her first bowl in an England shirt since the end of last summer. Word is that she’s found her rhythm again. Wong’s first ball is on the money but her second is too wide and thrashed away through point for four…7th over: West Indies 42-2 (Matthews 36, Grimmond 4) Here’s Em Arlott on debut. Matthews clips for two but is then bounced by Arlott. Good response from the debutant. The bowler gets one to jag back into Grimmond and there’s a decent appeal… NOT OUT – heading down leg. Nice first over from Arlott, that’ll settle her nerves. Five off the over.6th over: West Indies 37-2 (Matthews 33, Grimmond 2) Dean lands it on a postage stamp for the first two balls but is then lined up by Matthews. Three fours in a row follow – two swipes to the leg side fence and a crunching drive to finish! England will be very aware that they need to get her out pronto.5th over: West Indies 23-2 (Matthews 15, Grimmond 1) Matthews is in prime form and counterpunches for West Indies - Smith is driven for four through mid-on. It’s lovely cat and mouse stuff between bowler and batter, Smith trying to second guess and Matthews very keen to crack some boundaries. A single is a victory to the bowler.4th over: West Indies 17-2 (Matthews 15, Grimmond 0) A double wicket maiden for Lauren Bell. The ball is hooping about and England buzz around in the field.WICKET! Zaida James c †Jones b Bell 0 (West Indies 17-2)Klang! Bell gets another in the over! Horrible shot from Zaida James, a real waft outside off stump to a ball shaping away, the nick is swallowed by Amy Jones and it’s smiles all round for the ladies in red*.*Not now Chris.England's Lauren Bell (right) celebrates with teammates after dismissing West Indies' Zaida James (centre), who looks dejected. Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAWICKET! Qiana Joseph c Smith b Bell 2 (West Indies 17-1)Gone! Bell comes back after a change of ends and it works immediately – Joseph looks to flick to leg and gets a big leading edge that loops to Linsay Smith at backward point. Well caught, that was a swirler. England have their first scalp.Linsey Smith of England takes the catch to dismiss Qiana Joseph of West Indies. Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images3rd over: West Indies 17-0 (Joseph 2, Matthews 15) Change of bowling – Linsay Smith replaces Bell. Close! A big heave into the leg side from Matthews and the ball somehow misses the off stump. Another dot is followed by a slog sweep for SIX! A real crack off the bat as Matthews gets hold of Smith and the ball clears the rope comfortably. Smith gets out of the over without any further damage.2nd over: West Indies 11-0 (Joseph 2, Matthews 9) Charlie Dean with the second over and she starts well, sliding one past the edge of Joseph’s blade and bowling to her tight field. Just two singles off it.1st over: West Indies 9-0 (Joseph 1, Matthews 8) Joseph taps a single off the first ball to open her account and then Bell sends down a real loosener to Matthews – a juicy full toss that the batter slaps away to the point boundary with disdain. Bell drags her length back and joins two dots with a hit of swing. Bosh! A short ball is pulled away in style by Matthews. Scrappy first over from England, productive one for West Indies.Lauren Bell of England unleashes a delivery. Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty ImagesIt looks a bit blustery and grey down in Canterbury but is thankfully dry. Definitely jumper weather. The players emerge onto the outfield and Lauren Bell is going to start with the new white ball. Hayley Matthews and Qiana Joseph on strike for the visitors.The England players take to the field. Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersEngland captain Nat Sciver-Brunt and her players huddle. Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty ImagesNo Sophie Ecclestone or Sarah Glenn for England then with those in the know suggesting that the former would have been dropped had she not been recovering from injury.Fast bowler Issy Wong returns to the set up after a lengthy time out of the camp struggling with her form and all-rounder Emily Arlott gets a deserved debut after strong showings in the early part of the season. Charlotte Edwards has spoken about how she wants to get more competition for places and shake up what was a bit of a cosy system. This first XI seems to be evidence of exactly that.Here are the teams:England: Danni Wyatt-Hodge, Sophia Dunkley, Nat Sciver-Brunt (capt), Heather Knight, Amy Jones (wk), Alice Capsey, Em Arlott, Issy Wong, Charlie Dean, Linsey Smith, Lauren BellWest Indies: Hayley Matthews (capt), Qiana Joseph, Zaida James, Realeanna Grimmond, Shabika Gajnabi, Aaliyah Alleyne, Jannillea Glasgow, Mandy Mangru (wk), Cherry-Anne Fraser, Afy Fletcher, Karishma RamharackEngland win the toss and will bowl first!Nat Sciver-Brunt’s first act as captain is a success as she wins the toss and chooses to bowl first on a flat looking pitch. She looks a wee bit nervous and admits as much.“I’ve been a bit nervous all day, but excited to get going. I’m still growing into the role and hope to get more comfortable.”PreambleJames WallaceHello and welcome to the opening salvo of the summer between England and West Indies from Canterbury.Humiliated and whitewashed 16-0 in the Ashes – who you gonna call?Charlotte Edwards! (It sort of scans doesn’t it Ray Parker Jnr?)Today’s T20 in Kent marks the start of the Charlotte Edwards and Nat Sciver-Brunt era, one in which the Head Coach and bona-fide ‘England legend’ will look to raise standards and drive this talented bunch of players onwards and upwards from a period of stagnation, selectorial sameness and even accusations of poor fitness and standards of professionalism. Not exactly and empty in-tray then.Raf Nicholson wrote recently about how the new regime is likely to shape up in comparison to the previous one:“This new era of England women’s cricket will be driven forward by Edwards: she will set the standards and write the plans, and the captain will implement them. Sciver-Brunt described her role as “focusing on pitch things and winning games for England”. That is a 180-degree shift from her predecessor, Heather Knight, whose voice on and off the pitch was heard more loudly than either of England’s previous head coaches, Jon Lewis and Lisa Keightley.”I spoke to Edwards just before she was offered the job and was impressed with her steeliness and passion. The players seem to love her and she is going to demand a lot from them – she’s already announced that minimum fitness standards are on the horizon. Today’s opponents are West Indies and the last time the two sides met the women in maroon knocked England out of the T20 World Cup before the knockout phase.Plenty to get into then as a new era begins. Play starts at 6.30pm and we’ll have news of the toss and teams imminently. As always, feel free to drop us a line at the link on the left of the page.",

Sciver-Brunt described her role as “focusing on pitch things and winning games for England”. That is a 180-degree shift from her predecessor, Heather Knight, whose voice on and off the pitch was heard more loudly than either of England’s previous head coaches, Jon Lewis and Lisa Keightley.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/15/charlotte-edwards-england-cricket-interview-womens-ashes\" data-link-name=\"in body link\"\u003eI spoke to Edwards just before she was offered the job\u003c/a\u003e and was impressed with her steeliness and passion.
