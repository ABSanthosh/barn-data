  "text": "India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate has explained why India picked a fifth spinner in their squad in Washinton Sundar for the second New Zealand Test. Following India’s defeat to the Black Caps in Bengaluru, the hosts drafted in Sundar for the second match, beginning in Pune on October 24. The decision was seen as a desperate bid to bounce back in the series, with a black soil pitch, that generally aids the slower bowlers, being prepared for the Pune game. Along with crucial World Test Championship points, India’s record of an 18 series-winning streak at home is at stake, and the inclusion of Sundar was an indication that the two teams would play on a rank-turner in the second Test. The inclusion also came on the back of a poor performance by R Ashwin, who was brought late into the attack during New Zealand’s run chase, bowling just two overs for six runs. He had earlier picked up 1-94 in the first innings and was India’s most expensive bowler, conceding 5.87 runs per over. Ten Doeschate, however, clarified that bringing Sundar into the squad was a reward for the players doing well in domestic cricket. The Tamil Nadu off-spinner had an excellent game against Delhi last week, scoring 152 with the bat and then picking up three wickets in each innings. Besides Sundar and Ashwin, India also have Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav in the squad. Ten Doeschate: Sundar added as New Zealand have plenty of left-handers He further added that New Zealand have as many as four-handers in their side, and Sundar provides variety in the bowling attack. “We've obviously got Axar in the squad as well. They're filled with four left-handers in their 11. We want the option to take the ball away from the left-handers as well. You know, we've had Washi around the white ball squad for a while and we like the way he operates. It's also nice to see that guys are getting rewarded for a Ranji Trophy performances as well. “So hopefully that sends a good message out to all the other guys. But it's certainly not a desperate measure. We've got a lot of faith in the spinners we have. We just want to make sure we're absolutely prepared for the conditions. And if that does mean taking the ball away from the left-hander, we want that option.” He also confirmed there were no injury concerns for Ashwin. “Ashwin's fine. He's absolutely fine. He bowled nicely. I know he bowled only two overs in the second innings, but it looked like his pace and his rhythm were back to where it needs to be.\" Follow Wisden for all cricket updates, including live scores, match stats, quizzes and more.
