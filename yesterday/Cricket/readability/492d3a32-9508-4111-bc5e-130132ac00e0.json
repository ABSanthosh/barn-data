  "text": "Former Australia batter David Warner will play in The Hundred for the first time having been signed by London Spirit. The 38-year-old was initially signed by Southern Brave for the first edition of The Hundred in 2020 before it was cancelled because of Covid-19, but had not been picked up since. Meanwhile, former England seamer James Anderson went unsold, as did 16-year-old Rocky Flintoff, son of legendary all-rounder Andrew. Anderson, 42, also entered the auction for this year's Indian Premier League and did not earn a deal, but he hopes to play all formats for Lancashire this summer. Other notable signings included England all-rounder Jamie Overton joining Warner at Spirit as he was signed in the highest price bracket of £200,000.\"Any competition with David Warner in it, benefits,\" Oval Invincibles captain Sam Billings, who led his side to back-to-back titles in 2023 and 2024, told BBC Sport.\"He is box office, it's very different playing with him to playing against him! But I've learned a huge amount from him as a player and in terms of leadership. I can't speak highly enough of him.\" Warner's fellow Australian Glenn Maxwell withdrew from the draft, but Southern Brave picked New Zealand all-rounder Michael Bracewell, former England seamer David Willey joined Trent Rockets and Manchester Originals opted for Afghanistan wrist-spinner Noor Ahmad as the other highest-paid players.Fast bowler Reece Topley also joined Brave to form an exciting pace line-up with fellow England players Jofra Archer, Tymal Mills and Chris Jordan.Originals selected Black Caps all-rounder Rachin Ravindra, who was player of the tournament at the recent Champions Trophy, while England Test batter Zak Crawley moved from Spirit to Northern Superchargers.The Hundred starts on 5 August, and there will be a further wildcard draft in May where all teams can sign in-form players from the domestic circuit. In the women's competition, England captain Heather Knight was picked again by London Spirit after leading them to the title in 2024, while fast bowler Issy Wong also joins from Birmingham Phoenix.Knight was crucial to Spirit's triumphant campaign with 271 runs across 10 innings, while Wong - who has played all three formats for England - will look to rediscover her form after falling out of favour internationally and struggling to make the Phoenix XI last year. Welsh Fire, who were beaten by Spirit in last year's final, kept England batter Sophia Dunkley and recruited leg-spinner Katie Levick. Phoenix had the first pick of the draft and attempted to sign Paige Scholfield, Dunkley and Knight, but they were all retained by their 2024 teams via the Right to Match option.Trent Rockets and Manchester Originals used their £36,000 bracket on young domestic players, signing 20-year-old Essex all-rounder Jodi Grewcock and wicketkeeper-batter Seren Smale, also 20, respectively.Australia newcomer Georgia Voll, 21, will play her first year in the competition for Phoenix, who also picked England batter Emma Lamb.Other overseas picks include New Zealand all-rounder Sophie Devine joining Southern Brave alongside South Africa's Chloe Tryon, and West Indies' Deandra Dottin remains with Manchester Originals.",
