  "text": "Heather Knight has been sacked as England captain following her side's 16-0 loss in Australia.Knight has been in the position since 2016, but has overseen a difficult winter, with a series win in South Africa sandwiched between a disappointing T20 World Cup campaign and a tumultuous Ashes tour of Australia.On Friday, head coach Jon Lewis was also removed from his position after a review of the tour led by England director of women's cricket Clare Connor. Knight, 34, led the side in eight Tests, 94 one-day internationals and 96 T20s, with 134 wins from her 199 matches in charge.\"I have loved being England captain, it's been the most rewarding period of my career,\" said Knight.\"But for now I'm excited to focus on my batting and supporting the team and the new captain in the best way I can.\"Winning the ICC Women's World Cup on home turf at Lord's in 2017 will always be a huge highlight, but being a part of the huge steps forward made in the women's game off the pitch brings me just as much pride.\"Connor said Knight was an \"outstanding leader and role model\".She will remain available for England selection as a player only, but the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) are yet to confirm who will be her successor. Nat Sciver-Brunt and Amy Jones have both deputised for Knight when she has been absent because of injury, while off-spinner Charlie Dean has been touted as a potential permanent candidate.England's home summer starts with a white-ball series against West Indies starting in May, before they take on India in June and July.\"I absolutely think it is the right decision. It is time for a fresh start for this England team,\" World Cup-winning spinner Alex Hartley told BBC Radio 5 Live.\"She was an unbelievable leader and she'll help on a leadership front moving forward even though she'll just be concentrating on herself.\"She's actually playing the best she's played in a number of years - she's dominating the game in all formats so hopefully with a little bit of pressure off her shoulders now her game can go to another level.\"Knight took over the side in a period of transition following legendary captain Charlotte Edwards' retirement - and a year into her tenure, England won the 50-over World Cup by beating India at Lord's.However, she failed to win an Ashes series in five attempts during her time in charge, with this latest defeat the most chastening as Australia dominated throughout.It was the first time a side has lost every match in an Ashes series since the multi-format points system was introduced in 2013.Knight leaves at a similar time for transition, with several senior players coming towards the end of their careers and with the team expecting to blood younger players from a fully professional domestic system.The Ashes defeat prompted Connor and the ECB to call for an in-depth review, the results of which are yet to be published publicly, but the removals of Knight and Lewis are the first steps of England's rebuild. There were also issues off the field in Australia, with unwanted headlines regarding their attitude, which will need addressing by the new coach and captain this summer. Following the T20 World Cup in October, where England exited at the group stage after a shambolic performance against West Indies, former player and current BBC Test Match Special pundit Hartley criticised the team's fitness. During the Ashes, spinner Sophie Ecclestone then refused a television interview with Hartley, who was working for Australia's Channel 7, with Connor describing it as an \"unfortunate incident that will not happen again\".",
