But there was no denying Australia once openers Beth Mooney and Georgia Voll came to the crease.The left-right combination blazed away for an unbroken 77 runs during the six overs of the powerplay and fired Australia to within 25 runs of their target by the halfway mark of the chase. Voll was dismissed soon after reaching her maiden T20 half-century with Australia only 15 runs short of their mark, but Mooney celebrated her 200th international by hitting the winning runs as she finished on 75 not out.But Australia’s win could have come at a huge cost with all-rounder Ash Gardner sent for scans on her right index finger after injuring it while attempting to catch a powerful Devine straight drive late in the White Ferns’ innings.New Zealand picked up a couple of late wickets when the win was already out of their reach but will have to significantly turn around their form and come with better bowling plans if they are to challenge Australia when the arch-rivals meet again on Sunday.Georgia Voll and Beth Mooney take the game away from New Zealand with a 123-run opening stand for Australia at Eden Park. Photograph: Dave Rowland/Getty ImagesAustralia beat New Zealand by eight wicketsAustralia make a statement against the T20 world champions as they race to New Zealand’s 138-run target with eight wickets in hand and 39 balls remaining. Beth Mooney (75 not out) appropriately hit the winning runs after sharing a 123-run opening stand with Georgia Voll (50) that put the result firmly within Australia’s grasp by the time they reached the second-innings drinks break.WICKET! Litchfield c Inglis b Tahuhu 2 (Australia 131-2)The White Ferns pick up another scalp that will only give them a boost with two matches still to play in the series. Litchfield tries to clip around the corner but gets a tickle through to the keeper. The ball has only just carried to Inglis but the young gun is on her way.Perry comes to the crease and immediately cops a rib-tickler as Australia edge closer to victory.13th over: Australia 136-2 (Mooney 74, Perry 2)12th over: Australia 130-1 (Mooney 73, Litchfield 2) New Zealand almost pick up another as Litchfield half-heatedly drives back towards Kerr and lifts the shot agonisingly short of the bowler’s reach. Mooney looks far more comfortable as she cuts for three runs at backward point.11th over: Australia 123-1 (Mooney 68, Litchfield 0) SIX! No let up from Beth Mooney with victory now in Australia’s sights. The left-hander dances down the track and clobbers Tahuhu over long on for the first six of the game. Voll brings up her first T20 fifty, to go with her earlier ODI ton, before she picks out Carson just inside the rope at deep square leg.WICKET! Voll c Carson b Tahuhu 50 (Australia 123-1)A consolation scalp for New Zealand as Georgia Voll brings up her maiden T20I fifty then holes out clipping over the infield towards deep square leg.10th over: Australia 113-0 (Mooney 60, Voll 49) That’s drinks and this contest is already all but over after a scintillating opening stand from Mooney and Voll. Mooney has reached 60 not out from 33 balls with 10 boundaries, while Voll is far from staying in her more experienced partner’s shadow as the young gun amasses an unbeaten 49 from 29 deliveries with nine fours. The 21-year-old is working to a plan as she sweeps away at Melie Kerr, starting with another boundary before the Australia pair cruise into the break with four easy singles.The visitors only need another 25 runs with all 10 wickets still in hand.9th over: Australia 105-0 (Mooney 58, Voll 43)Beth Mooney passes fifty for the 28th time in T20Is with her ninth boundary of the innings to reach the milestone from only 28 balls. The No 1-ranked batter in the world celebrates with another four after a rare misfield from Melie Kerr on the boundary.8th over: Australia 93-0 (Mooney 49, Voll 41) Melie Kerr comes into the attack and not a moment too soon as the game races away from the White Ferns. A mixed bag of leggies and wrong’uns momentarily ties down the Australians until Voll punishes a half-volley and then sweeps for back-to-back boundaries.7th over: Australia 84-0 (Mooney 48, Voll 33) Perhaps the best over of the innings for New Zealand and it almost ends with a much-needed breakthrough. Eden Carson stops the flow of boundaries before Mooney clubs a straight drive back at the bowler. The off-spinner gets both hands to it but can’t hang on to the difficult chance. Mooney checks on the bowler from the non-striker’s end but Carson looks more concerned with spilling the rare chance.6th over: Australia 77-0 (Mooney 43, Voll 31) It’s hard to see how New Zealand might dismiss either of these batters right now but they almost do just that when the Australians set off for a risky single. A better throw might have had Voll short of her crease but a desperate dive gets her bat over the line just in time. Three more boundaries from the over make it 14 for the innings as Australia end a devastating powerplay on 77 without loss.5th over: Australia 63-0 (Mooney 34, Voll 26) A frankly incredible over from Beth Mooney as the Australia opener takes Lea Tahuhu for 18 runs with four boundaries and a couple more when a straight cut stopped just short of the rope. Mooney starts with a four through cover, adds another when picking up the flight quickly and dispatching the ball to fine leg, then makes it three-in-a-row over midwicket. But the left-hander saves the best for last with a clip of her pads to pick the gap at fine leg.4th over: Australia 45-0 (Mooney 16, Voll 26) No surprise to see Mair pulled from the attack after her horror opener but spinner Eden Carson finds it just as hard to reign in the run-rate. Left-hander Mooney starts the over with three through cover then adds a boundary after two steps down the pitch and a perfectly-timed stroke over the same area. Voll pulls out a sweep and clubs four of her own behind square leg.3rd over: Australia 30-0 (Mooney 6, Voll 21) Jess Kerr has the ball shaping into the right-hander but Voll is fortunate to get an inside edge onto one that slices straight through her on the way to the rope. Voll punishes the bowler with a controlled loft over mid-on that bounces over the rope. Australia on top in the powerplay.2nd over: Australia 18-0 (Mooney 5, Voll 10) Georgia Voll opens up with perhaps the shot of the day so far as a sublime straight cut bounces away to the boundary. A no-ball and follow-up wide from Rosemary Mair gives Voll a free hit which she gladly pummels away over midwicket for four. The young opener is particularly dangerous on the leg-side, so Mair could hardly have put that in a worse spot. The pacer oversteps again, this time by a long way, but a smarter follow-up to Mooney limits the damage on the free hit but only until the star opener clips another boundary. That’s 16 from a very long over.1st over: Australia 2-0 (Mooney 1, Voll 1) Jess Kerr has the ball swinging about as the Australia openers are content to make a steady start. Mooney opens the scoring with a gentle push to mid-on while Voll gets off the mark with a controlled drive to the deep.Openers Beth Mooney and Georgia Voll are at the crease with Jess Kerr at the top of her mark. Australia need 138 runs to win.Cricket Australia have just confirmed that Ash Gardner has been sent for scans to assess the extent of the injury to her right index finger.Ash Gardner bowls against New Zealand at Eden Park. Photograph: Dave Rowland/Getty ImagesNew Zealand set a target of 138The White Ferns finish strongly with 35 runs from the last three overs to reach a competitive 137-2 as Melie Kerr (51 not out) leads the way. Sophie Devine took time to get going before powerful hitting towards the end of the innings lifted her to 39 not out as Australia showed signs of cracking under pressure in the field. Ash Gardner was forced off the ground after Devine smashed a straight drive back at the bowler but it remains to be seen whether the in-form all-rounder will be available to take part in the chase.19th over: New Zealand 124-2 (A Kerr 46, Devine 32) DROPPED! The substitute fielder Alana King grasses a chance off Devine and the bowler and skipper, Tahlia McGrath does not look pleased. A misfield from Perry gives up a couple more as the Australians suddenly look sloppy in the field, after Devine gets away with a big swing that takes an edge to the rope at third. A handy over for the White Ferns as they up the ante.18th over: New Zealand 111-2 (A Kerr 41, Devine 24) Hearts in mouths as Tahlia McGrath sets herself for a catch at mid-off but she has misread the flight and the ball sails over her head. One of those days where the ball has followed the skipper in the field, as Kerr picks up two runs. The White Ferns batter should be run out a couple of balls later when coming back for two as Mooney fails to gather, then Devine makes the Australians pay with a boundary down the ground to end the over.17th over: New Zealand 102-2 (A Kerr 36, Devine 20) Devine is dropped! The White Ferns veteran absolutely hammers a straight drive back at Ash Gardner and the off-spinner did well to even get a hand to it. But the pace and power has done some damage with blood coming from Gardner’s bowling hand as she walks from the field. Georgia Wareham bowls the four remaining deliveries as the New Zealand pair set out to attack and Devine eventually finds an elusive boundary at mid-off. The 50-run partnership comes up from 55 balls.16th over: New Zealand 95-2 (A Kerr 34, Devine 15) Kerr survives a lbw call as a review shows a thick inside edge before the ball crashes into her pads. But three singles off Sutherland’s over are barely enough with only four remaining.15th over: New Zealand 92-2 (A Kerr 32, Devine 14) Kerr is looking dangerous as she comfortably works the ball around the field. A deft touch sends Brown’s first delivery to the third boundary as three singles then keep the runs coming.14th over: New Zealand 85-2 (A Kerr 26, Devine 13) A better over for New Zealand with Melie Kerr starting to find her touch. The all-rounder welcomes back Megan Schutt by clubbing her through mid-off then eases the ball either side of the pitch for more risk-free runs. Devine gets in on the act by guiding the ball to the rope at third.13th over: New Zealand 72-2 (A Kerr 18, Devine 8) Georgia Wareham ties up the White Ferns with a superb over. A run of three dot balls is broken with a swipe from Kerr that seems a risky way to pick up a single as the pressure piles up on New Zealand.12th over: New Zealand 69-2 (A Kerr 16, Devine 7) Tahlia McGrath continues and shows why she should probably bowl more in T20s with a testing line and enough variety in her pace and length. Kerr and Devine keep the scoreboard ticking over but New Zealand might look to find more boundaries especially with eight wickets still in hand.11th over: New Zealand 62-2 (A Kerr 12, Devine 4) A different Melie Kerr returns from the drinks break as she looks to take the game to Australia off-spinner Ash Gardner. The all-rounder lifts Gardner over mid-off for a boundary as the New Zealand pair pick the gaps better for a trio of singles.10th over: New Zealand 55-2 (A Kerr 6, Devine 3) Chaotic running between wickets gifts Australia a couple of chances but they fail to take either. Georgia Wareham misses the first as Kerr hustles back to the non-striker’s end and sneaks home just as the throw misses the stumps. Phoebe Litchfield has time to do much better with the next opportunity as Devine races half way down the pitch before reversing. That’s drinks with New Zealand needing to lift the run-rate through the middle overs.9th over: New Zealand 52-2 (A Kerr 3, Devine 3) An express-paced over from Darcie Brown but Beth Mooney is good enough to handle it standing up at the stumps. Devine glances a single to fine leg before Kerr is fortunate to pick up a run from an awkward attempt at a scoop. New Zealand need to turn over the strike more as the runs start to dry up.WICKET! Plimmer c Sutherland b McGrath 27 (New Zealand 47-1)Georgia Plimmer targets the short boundary on the leg side but can only pick out Annabel Sutherland well inside the rope. Tahlia McGrath has rarely bowled herself in recent times but gets the crucial breakthrough.8th over: New Zealand 50-2 (A Kerr 2, Devine 2)7th over: New Zealand 47-1 (Plimmer 27, A Kerr 1) Georgia Wareham is next up on the Australia bowling carousel and Plimmer immediately sends the leg-spinner to the boundary with a sweep to fine leg. Melie Kerr finally gets off the mark with an unconvincing stroke to deep square leg. The all-rounder has looked in better touch.6th over: New Zealand 40-1 (Plimmer 21, A Kerr 0) Plimmer again tries her luck down the ground and only just clears mid-on for a boundary off Brown. Australia keeper Beth Mooney comes up to the stumps to keep Plimmer in her crease and the tactic works a treat to slow the scoring. Clever cricket from Mooney in her 200th international.5th over: New Zealand 35-1 (Plimmer 16, A Kerr 0) Tahlia McGrath keeps the White Ferns guessing with another bowling change this time bringing Annabel Sutherland into the attack. A misfield from the skipper off the first ball relieves some of the pressure for the batters and leaves Sutherland to bowl out the over to a watchful Melie Kerr.4th over: New Zealand 32-1 (Plimmer 13, A Kerr 0) Australia get the early breakthrough with Bates on her way but might have had one earlier after Tahlia McGrath dropped a tough chance. Plimmer looks to send new bowler Darcie Brown down the ground but gets too far under the shot to give the Australia skipper half a chance. McGrath makes up good ground but can’t quite hang on to the ball while running back with the flight.WICKET! Bates c Mooney b Brown 14 (New Zealand 32-1)Suzie Bates swings wildly at a delivery in the sweet spot outside off-stump and Beth Mooney is the most interested in an appeal. The on-field umpire waves it away but the review spots a nick and the White Ferns’ dangerwoman is on her way after a fiery start.3rd over: New Zealand 20-0 (Bates 14, Plimmer 6) Megan Schutt turns to her bag of tricks to fight back with a clever over to Bates. The New Zealand opener is looking to be aggressive at any opportunity, whether stepping down the track or moving outside the line to target the area behind the keeper. But Schutt’s variety has the better of her with five dot balls and only a couple conceded over midwicket.2nd over: New Zealand 18-0 (Bates 12, Plimmer 6) Australia turn to spin with Ash Gardner taking the new ball. Georgia Plimmer is straight onto the back foot to find a gap behind point for a couple, then dances down the pitch to loft Gardner back over her head to the rope. New Zealand are targeting the short boundaries well.1st over: New Zealand 12-0 (Bates 12, Plimmer 0) A blazing start from White Ferns captain Suzie Bates with a trio of exquisite strokes in a row. The first is clipped off her pads to the boundary, the next is the pick of the bunch with a sublime cut and she finishes with a drive through cover. Not much movement for Schutt early.The national anthems are complete and New Zealand openers Suzie Bates and Georgia Plimmer have made their way to the middle. Australia quick Megan Schutt marks out her run and we’re about to get under way … game on!Tahlia McGrath conceded to Guardian Australia that her side will have to quickly adapt to the unusual dimensions of Eden Park – typically a rugby venue – against New Zealand today. Australia’s women have played one T20I at the Auckland venue back in 2021 … and that was abandoned after only 2.5 overs.This is how the venue looked just two weeks ago.Eden Park during a Super Rugby Pacific match between Blues and Brumbies. Photograph: Andrew Cornaga/AAPAustralia have become much more familiar with being the hunted over the past decade or more but this time have reason to make a strong statement against the T20 world champions.Tahlia McGrath is stand-in skipper with Alyssa Healy sidelined and explained to Guardian Australia that her side is carrying extra motivation into the three-match series in New Zealand. They’re the world champions and that’s what we want to be. There is a little bit extra on the line for us. We want to go out there and play some really good cricket and come away with, ideally, a 3-0 series win against the world champs. New Zealand XIThe White Ferns are back with a more familiar line up as nine players that were part of the XI in the T20 World Cup final return to face Australia. Veteran seamer Lea Tahuhu is back to boost the pace attack while promising batter Bella James will have to wait for her opportunity.New Zealand: Suzie Bates (capt), Georgia Plimmer, Melie Kerr, Sophie Devine, Brooke Halliday, Maddy Green, Jess Kerr, Polly Inglis (wk), Lea Tahuhu, Rosemary Mair, Eden Carson.Australia XIAustralia pick an XI packed with all-round talent that comfortably bats as deep as Georgia Wareham at No 9, withy the leg-spinner preferred to Alana King in conditions expected to favour swing and seam.

Australia had claimed the T20 World Cup at the three previous tournaments before their shock defeat to South Africa in the semi-finals, and have been on a tear since then with 12 victories from as many completed matches across all formats.Both sides are close to full strength though Australia are most crucially without captain Alyssa Healy for this three-match series as the star keeper-batter rehabilitates a foot injury. New Zealand have recalled Sophie Devine, who has given up the T20 captaincy since lifting the trophy last year, while Melie Kerr also returns after sitting out the white-ball matches against Sri Lanka and impressing in the WPL.The conditions in Auckland are looking promising for a full 40 overs, with a predicted high of 24C and little cloud around.First ball will be at 2.45pm local time or 12.45pm AEDT. I’ll be back shortly with the toss and team news, but in the meantime keep me company with your thoughts and predictions on email or @martinpegan on Bluesky or X. Let’s get into it!",
