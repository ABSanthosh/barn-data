Kishan clubbed three sixes in his third over, with the final six balls going for 19, while there were also four byes conceded off a full-toss no-ball in a chaotic conclusion to his spell.As a result, Rajasthan Royals conceded 286 – the second-highest score in IPL history. However, Archer’s IPL landmark – which included four sixes, 10 fours and only one dot ball – was well short of the world record belonging to Gambia’s Musa Jobarteh, who conceded 93 against Zimbabwe in October.",
