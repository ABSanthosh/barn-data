  "text": "England are considering former New Zealand international Tim Southee as their fast-bowling consultant for the home summer.James Anderson has held the position since he retired from Test cricket last summer, but is unavailable this year because of his playing commitments with Lancashire.Seamer Southee, 36, retired from international cricket in December as New Zealand's all-time leading wicket-taker.He is good friends with England head coach Brendon McCullum, who made a presentation to Southee on the outfield in Hamilton following his final appearance for the Black Caps.If Southee joins the England set-up he would become the third New Zealander on the staff, alongside McCullum and assistant coach Jeetan Patel.It is understood that other candidates have also been sounded out for the role.Whoever takes the position will be charged with guiding England's pace bowlers through the first part of a defining year, with a home Test series against India coming before the Ashes in Australia.England's summer begins with a one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge next month. A squad will be named at the end of this week.Injuries to Chris Woakes and Mark Wood will result in an inexperienced pace-bowling department. Gus Atkinson, with only 11 previous Tests, will be the most senior seamer.Sam Cook, 27, looks set for a first call-up after he was rested from Essex's Championship match against Somerset earlier this month at England's request.Josh Tongue and Matthew Potts will also be in the mix. Brydon Carse is recovering from a foot problem and Jofra Archer, currently at the Indian Premier League, could make his return to red-ball cricket for England Lions when they meet India A in June.Before Anderson retired England did not have a pace-bowling specialist in their coaching staff. After the 42-year-old ended his record-breaking international career, he remained a near-constant presence in the England dressing room.But he has signed a one-year deal to play with Lancashire this summer, which he has stated will be his priority, ahead of coaching commitments with England.Anderson is yet to play this season because of a calf injury and will again miss Lancashire's Championship match at home to Gloucestershire, starting on Friday. He could re-join the England staff for the Ashes series.",
