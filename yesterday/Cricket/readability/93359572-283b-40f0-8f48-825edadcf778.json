  "text": "Gautam BhattacharyyaCricket writer, DubaiAFPA billboard in Lahore features India and Pakistan's captains ahead of the Champions Trophy The last time India and Pakistan clashed in a major ICC 50-over contest was in 2023, at the highly anticipated World Cup league match in Ahmedabad.As a contest, it turned out to be a bit of an anti-climax - India, in dominant form, comfortably chased down a subpar Pakistan target, securing a resounding victory.And as Pakistani fans didn't get visas to travel to India, aside from the cricket team, the country's only notable presence was in the media centre.Sunday's ICC Champions Trophy clash between the arch-rivals at Dubai International Stadium promises a vastly different atmosphere.The International Cricket Council (ICC) reported that tickets sold out within minutes - and with the UAE hosting more than 3.7 million Indians and nearly 1.7 million Pakistanis, a vibrant and well-represented crowd from both nations is all but guaranteed. But can a sea of green flags in the stands inspire Pakistan's Mohammad Rizwan's men to defy the odds in this must-win clash against Rohit Sharma's India?Pakistan can take comfort in their strong head-to-head record in UAE - 19 wins in 28 ODIs, plus a lone T20I victory in the 2021 World Cup in Dubai.Getty ImagesPakistan won the Champions Trophy Final against India at the Oval by 180 runs in 2017Most of Pakistan's wins against India came at Sharjah during their dominant run in the 1980s and '90s, winning 18 of 24 games there.In Dubai, India beat them twice in the 2018 Asia Cup, while both teams won a game each in a 2006 Abu Dhabi series.Since Pakistan's glory days in Sharjah, the tide has shifted - apart from the occasional T20I win, India has largely dominated in the new millennium.Veteran cricket writer Ayaz Memon feels there is no reason to look at India-Pakistan clashes in the UAE through the prism of the past.''There is no doubt that Pakistan enjoyed tremendous crowd support in the Sharjah days, with the local Pathan population making up the numbers. However, the team then boasted of the likes of Imran Khan, Javed Miandad, Saeed Anwar, Aamer Sohail and the two Ws [Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis],\" Memon says. \"Compare that to the state of the current team, which comes up with some exceptional results from time to time but lacks any form of consistency.\"AFPPakistan fell to a 60-run defeat in the championship opener against New ZealandThe glitzy, ever-expanding United Arab Emirates city-state of Dubai offers little sign of a major cricket event - there are no welcome banners at the airport. Instead, hoardings of Jannik Sinner, Iga Swiatek and company dominate, as the city is in full swing for the annual Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships.Head south, and the 'Ring of Fire' at Dubai International Stadium emerges from the highway, signalling cricket's presence. Towering images of all eight captains line the arena, but for the next two days, all eyes will be on Rohit Sharma and Mohammed Rizwan's teams as fans worldwide await their fate.It's no secret that catering to broadcasters and marketing demands, the ICC consistently places India and Pakistan in the same group for major tournaments. This ensures at least one high-stakes league clash, with the potential for a blockbuster rematch in the knockouts.At a time when cricket faces overexposure and its international structure is threatened by the rise of T20 franchise leagues, the India-Pakistan rivalry remains its biggest box-office draw.AFPShubman Gill's classy century powered India to a comfortable win over Bangladesh on ThursdayA big plus about the tight, top-eight team format of the ICC Champions Trophy is that a little slip-up can cost even the heavyweights dear. ''The 50-over World Cup gives you a chance to pull back even if you stumble in the odd game as there are 10 games in the fray. It's much different here where all three of your group matches are important to proceed to the semi-finals,'' India captain Sharma said on the eve of their opening match against Bangladesh.India cleared their first hurdle with a six-wicket win against Bangladesh on Thursday, powered by Shubman Gill's classy century (cementing his status as a future ODI captain), Mohammed Shami's five-wicket haul and a quickfire cameo from skipper Sharma, who crossed the 11,000-run mark in the format.Jasprit Bumrah's absence - expected as he recovers from a back spasm sustained in the final Test in Australia - remains a talking point. However, on this wicket, the spotlight is set to shift to the spinners.Pakistan's lead-up to the tournament has been a rollercoaster - both unpredictable and vulnerable. Their last three ODIs paint the picture perfectly.Getty ImagesMohammed Shami's five-wicket haul helped India win the game against BangladeshTen days ago, Rizwan and Salman Ali Agha's stunning 260-run stand powered Pakistan to a record 353-run chase against South Africa in Karachi, securing a spot in the Tri-series final. But just two days later, they faltered, looking ordinary as New Zealand cruised to a five-wicket win, denying them a confidence boosting title ahead of the Champions Trophy.Then on Wednesday, after their bowlers made early inroads, they let the Kiwis off the hook, eventually crashing to a 60-run defeat in their tournament opener.This has put their backs against the wall ahead of the big game - and what has irked former Pakistan greats is captain Rizwan's statement that they will take the India match as \"just another game\". History shows that Pakistan thrives in such situations, echoing Imran Khan's legendary \"caged tigers\" rallying cry from their triumphant 1992 World Cup campaign. Yes, the odds favour India, but Pakistan can never be written off on UAE soil. After all, it's a new day, a fresh battle, and anything can happen in a big game.",
