The substantial covering of grass on the pitch, which is likely to assist the seamers early, had prompted that decision from New Zealand's new permanent white-ball captain Mitchell Santner.Right-arm seamer Eshan Malinga, 23, debuts for Sri Lanka. Known for his rapid pace, Malinga has had good returns in domestic and A team cricket over the past year. He gets into the XI ahead of Mohamed Shiraz, also a right-arm seamer. With Asitha Fernando, Lahiru Kumara, and allrounder Chamindu Wickramasinghe also in the XI, Sri Lanka have plenty of seam-bowling options. There is room only for one specialist spinner however - Wanindu Hasaranga.New Zealand, meanwhile, will miss Tom Latham, who is out with injury. They instead have Mitchell Hay keeping wickets. Their seam attack consists of Matt Henry, Will O'Rourke, Jacob Duffy, and allrounder Nathan Smith.Though the toss was conducted under blue skies, the southerlies blowing through the ground mean it is a particularly cold morning in Wellington, with temperatures around 15 degrees celsius.
