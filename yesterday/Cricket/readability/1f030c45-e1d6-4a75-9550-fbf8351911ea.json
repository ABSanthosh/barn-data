  "text": "India coach Gautam Gambhir has criticised the decision to host the victory parade where 11 people died on Wednesday and says his \"heart goes out\" to those affected.Dozens were also injured outside the M.Chinnaswamy Stadium as Royal Challengers Bengaluru celebrated their Indian Premier League victory.Karnataka state chief minister Siddaramaiah told reporters that authorities had not expected the number of people who had turned out.\"If we are not ready to hold a road show we should not have done that,\" former India batter and IPL-winning captain Gambhir said.\"As simple as it can get. I know fans do get excited, everyone gets excited, but nothing compared to what happened yesterday.\"One police official told the BBC more than 200,000 people packed the streets to see the team parade through the streets to the stadium but police expected half of that amount.An official said a stampede occurred when people tried to push through a small gate.On Thursday, RCB said they would give 1,000,000 rupees (£9,000) to the families of those killed.\"I was never a believer that we need to have roadshows, never,\" Gambhir said.\"My heart goes out to the people who lost their lives.\"We need to be responsible. We need to be responsible citizens and responsible in every aspect because every life matters.\"You cannot at any point in time lose 11 people. We can be more responsible.\"",
