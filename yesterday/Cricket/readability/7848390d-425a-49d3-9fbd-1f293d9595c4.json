  "text": "IPL 2025: KKR comfortably chased down a target of 152 vs RR, thanks to Quinton de Kock's 97 not out.© BCCI Quinton de Kock struck a magnificent 97 not out on a tacky Barsapara wicket, anchoring Kolkata Knight Riders' chase to perfection as they secured a dominant eight-wicket win against Rajasthan Royals in their IPL clash on Wednesday. Opting to bowl, KKR's disciplined bowling attack, led by their spin duo Varun Chakravarthy (2/17) and Moeen Ali (2/23), restricted Rajasthan Royals to a below-par 151/9. In response, De Kock remained 97 not out from 61 balls, his knock laced with eight fours and six sixes, as KKR comfortably chased down the target in 17.3 overs. — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) March 26, 2025Despite the challenging nature of the surface, De Kock displayed controlled aggression, timing the ball beautifully while ensuring KKR's chase remained on track.The chase was never in trouble, with the required run rate hovering around a run-a-ball.KKR lost Moeen Ali (5) and skipper Ajinkya Rahane (18) early, but De Kock held one end firm, finding an able partner in young Angkrish Raghuvanshi 22 (17 balls).The duo stitched together an unbroken 83-run partnership that came off just 44 balls, sealing the first win of the season for the defending champions.The Proteas keeper-batter was at his fluent best, preferring groundstrokes over aerial risks, yet still finding boundaries with ease. — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) March 26, 2025He took calculated risks, fully aware of the modest target.He took the attack to Jofra Archer, smashing him for a four and a six in the same over.He brought up his half-century in just 35 balls, swiping Wanindu Hasaranga for a towering six over wide long-on -- his third of the innings.The Royals may have overplayed their spin options, allowing KKR's batters to settle into a rhythm.Hasaranga, who had dismissed De Kock twice in the past, was dominated in this matchup.A more aggressive approach -- bringing in Jofra Archer during the middle overs -- could have added pressure, but English speedster was brought in as late as 18th over with KKR needing just 17 runs from 18 balls.It was just a formality as De Kock welcomed him with a boundary before launching him for two sixes to wrap it up in a canter.Earlier, Chakravarthy and Ali dismantled the Royals' middle order, picking up two wickets each in successive overs right after the powerplay, shifting the momentum in KKR's favour. — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) March 26, 2025Seamer Vaibhav Arora (2/33) was expensive but chipped in with two crucial wickets -- regular Royals skipper Sanju Samson (13 off 11) with a yorker in the powerplay before dismissing impact substitute Shubham Dubey (9) cheaply.Harshit Rana (2/36) was instrumental at the death, breaking Dhruv Jurel's promising innings of 33 (28) and removing the dangerous Shimron Hetmyer for just 7, both in the crucial penultimate over.A quickfire cameo 16 from 7 balls from Jofra Archer ensured that they reached 150-mark but he fell to Spencer Johnson (1/42) in the penultimate ball of their innings. — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) March 26, 2025RR had looked set for a big total at 54 for 1, with a well-set Yashasvi Jaiswal (29 off 24) and local lad Riyan Parag (25 off 15) at the crease.Riyan, leading the Royals for the first time at his home ground, began with intent, smashing Harshit Rana for a six over square leg off just the third ball he faced.Riyan, who knows the Barsapara pitch like the back of his hand, played the shot of the innings in the next over -- a beautifully timed lofted drive off Vaibhav Arora, sending the ball soaring straight down the ground.Jaiswal, dropped on 19, capped off the powerplay with a six as RR finished the first six overs strongly at 54/1.However, KKR struck back immediately. Chakravarthy, their mystery spinner, triggered the collapse in the seventh over, dismissing the dangerous-looking Parag with a well-disguised 113kph delivery.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)
