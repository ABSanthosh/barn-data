Washington Sundar! 6, 6, wd, 4! Trent Boult has been shelled out the treatment, MI look shell-shocked! None of Hardik Pandya's tactics are working at the moment.

Washington Sundar receives a slower short ball by Boult, who is back into the attack, and Washington helps it over square-leg for a maximum. Next ball, even bigger. SIX more! Smashed. Bludgeoned. Over mid-wicket.GT 143/2 (12.5) GT vs MI LIVE: Runs keep coming! GT are keeping this very much alive!

Ashwani Kumar is on as the Impact Player, with Rohit Sharma being substituted. Washington hits it back past Hardik the bowler, straight down the ground for 4. Hardik's comeback is excellent, nails a yorker and gets a dot ball.GT 113/2 (10.4) GT vs MI LIVE: 106 after first 10 106 runs after 10 overs, meaning GT need 123 in the final 10. Still a long, long way to go.

Gujarat Titans get to 100 in just 9.2 overs. And Washington Sundar hits a boundary on the very next ball! Gleeson has conceded a lot of runs today.

The two wickets haven't slowed the run-rate by a huge amount, with Sudharsan continuing the boundaries.GT 85/2 (8) GT vs MI LIVE: HIT WICKET! Kusal Mendis GONE! Hit wicket! Dramatic scenes here in Mullanpur. Goes deep into his crease to play Mitchell Santner, but loses his balance and falls onto his stumps! MI break the partnership in the strangest of manners.GT 67/2 (6.2) GT vs MI LIVE: 66 in the powerplay Losing Shubman Gill in the first over was a huge blow, but GT have made a superb recovery right after that.

Sai Sudharsan with a cracking shot against Bumrah! Slammed through mid-wicket, exquisite timing with power. A big feat for him meanwhile -- he has become only the second batter to score 700+ in an IPL season before the age of 24 (Gill was the other).GT 59/1 (5.1) GT vs MI LIVE: GT romping Sai Sudharsan and Kusal Mendis are both playing really well! 50 partnership up between the two and they're going at 11 runs an over in the powerplay. Boundaries coming thick and fast. A bit of a desperate move from Hardik as he bowls in the powerplay, but it backfires as 14 come off the over.GT 55/1 (5) GT vs MI LIVE: Sudharsan crosses 700 runs! BANG! Thrashed through the off-side by Sai Sudharsan! Gujarat Titans staying alive in this chase despite the early loss of their captain.

Three balls later, Kusal Mendis slams a maximum, cracking shot over deep mid-wicket. Having dropped Rohit earlier, he has a big responsibility on his shoulders with the bat today.Make that THREE! Kusal again, over square-leg. Handsome shot.GT 30/1 (3) GT vs MI LIVE: Bumrah opens the bowling Jasprit Bumrah taking the new ball from the other end. With no Deepak Chahar today, responsibility with the new ball returns to the shoulders of Bumrah. And he shows his quality. Does not offer an inch to the others.GT 9/1 (2) GT vs MI LIVE: OUT! SHUBMAN GILL GONE! Humongous wicket for Mumbai Indians in the very first over. This is the worst-possible start for Gujarat Titans, they've lost their captain. Fast inswinger by Trent Boult, Gill misses it, traps on the pad and the finger goes up straight away.Gill takes the DRS review, but he's out.GT 5/1 (1) GT vs MI LIVE: The chase begins... Shubman Gill and B Sai Sudharsan are out to open, Trent Boult is taking the new ball. A daunting target is in front of Gujarat Titans. A cracking cover drive by Sai Sudharsan early on, but stopped well in the field.GT 3/0 (0.3) IPL 2025 Eliminator LIVE: GT need 229 A massive target for Gujarat Titans. With no Jos Buttler, they will need Shubman Gill and B Sai Sudharsan to give them a terrific start, as well as hope that their slightly more fragile middle order can come good today. Onus on Kusal Mendis to make up for his fielding mistakes. GT vs MI LIVE: MI end on 228 228! Daunting total set by Mumbai Indians in the Eliminator. It is the highest score made in the Mullanpur ground. Rohit Sharma leading the way with a sensational 81, and he's made sure that his Test captaincy successor Shubman Gill will not have an easy night to come.MI 228/5 (20 overs)GT Target: 229 GT vs MI LIVE: Third six of the over Massive! Once again, Hardik Pandya shows his might. What a finish the MI captain is providing here. Coetzee has conceded 21 in this over, and we still have a ball left. Hammered over long-off, and another wide by Coetzee.MI 227/5 (19.5) GT vs MI LIVE: SIX MORE! Hardik Pandya, that is sweet! Short ball by Coetzee and sent way into the stands by the Mumbai Indians captain. Two balls to go still, and Coetzee bowls a wide!

Next ball, Naman goes for a big shot again through deep mid-wicket, but Rashid Khan has completed a superb diving catch!MI 206/5 (18.4) IPL 2025 Eliminator LIVE: Injury concern for GT Mohammed Siraj is down, and is being attended to by the physios. Two balls after taking a wicket, he seems to have picked up an injury. He is fit enough to continue, and he does get through the whole over. Still hobbling a fair bit, but a good comeback after conceding a six on the first ball.MI 198/4 (18) GT vs MI LIVE: OUT! Six, but then out! Tilak Varma hammers Mohammed Siraj for a maximum on the first ball of the 17th over, but misses his timing on the pace-off delivery and departs. Handy 25 off just 11 balls by Tilak.

Prasidh gave away 26 in his previous over, and this one hasn't started well.MI 181/2 (16.1) IPL 2025 Eliminator LIVE: Tilak into the party! Here comes Tilak Varma, going for the attack! Slams it over long-off for a maximum. Mumbai Indians maintaining a fabulous run-rate today. They've dominated this match so far, ridden their luck, and made it count.MI 175/2 (16) GT vs MI LIVE: Rohit into the 80s SIX more! Whipped away over square-leg, all the way for 6. Next ball, change of pace by Coetzee, goes for a cutter, soft edge from Rohit but it falls just short of Kusal Mendis. How many more chances will GT miss to dismiss Rohit?MI 168/2 (15.4) GT vs MI LIVE: SIX! Maximum for Rohit Sharma! Up to 74! Rohit Sharma is just 26 runs away from this third IPL century, and first in the playoffs. Mumbai Indians are going at well over 10 runs an over, and should be aiming for at least 220 from here.MI 160/2 (15) GT vs MI LIVE: 150 up for Mumbai Indians! Seven runs came off the over from Washington Sundar. Rohit Sharma played a cut shot on the fourth ball of the over through the backward point for a four.

Surya is gone for 33 off 20 balls.MI 143/2 (13) GT vs MI LIVE: Catch dropped! It was an eventful over from Gerald Coetzee. He was hit for two consecutive sixes by Suryakumar Yadav but bounced back well and managed to produce an outside edge of the batter. GT wicketkeeper Kusal Mendis jumped to his right and dropped the chance. A total of 14 runs came off the over.MI 134/1 (12) GT vs MI LIVE: Good bowling! Rashid Khan continues to bowl tight overs. Seven runs came from this third. He even produced an inside edge from Suryakumar Yadav's bat on the fourth ball of the over when the batter tried to play a sweep shot, but to his poor luck the ball missed the stumps and the wicketkeeper to race away for a four. MI 120/1 (11) GT vs MI LIVE: 50 FOR ROHIT! 50 for Rohit Sharma! Big day, big player. Dropped twice at the start, and he's taken full advantage of the lifelines handed to him. Gets to the milestone in just 28 balls.

Rohit Sharma goes big! 100 up for Mumbai Indians! Rohit is up to 46, MI reach 100 in under 9 overs.

What a hit from the Englishman, welcome back to the IPL! Length ball and Bairstow clears it over deep square-leg. Next ball, smashed through point for another boundary. Bairstow in the mood.MI 38/0 (3.2) GT vs MI LIVE: Rohit dropped again! Another drop! Rohit Sharma has been dropped not once, but TWICE! Thick outside edge against Siraj, but wicket-keeper Kusal Mendis has completely fumbled it. Not easy filling the boots of Jos Buttler, but this could be a costly problem. MI 26/0 (2.4) GT vs MI LIVE: FOUR! FOUR! Rohit! Rohit Sharma slams it down the ground! Classy shot from the former MI captain, straight back past the bowler. Next ball, he connects even better, one bounce and into the fence. Rohit was dropped on 3, will he make GT pay?MI 26/0 (2.2) GT vs MI LIVE: DROPPED! Big mistake! Rohit Sharma has been dropped by Gerald Coetzee!

Massive fielding error by GT.MI 18/0 (2) GT vs MI LIVE: New ball for Prasidh Interesting decision by Shubman Gill! Prasidh Krishna is usually the middle overs enforcer and bowls at the death. But in the absence of Arshad Khan or Ishant Sharma, Prasidh is taking the new ball today for GT.MI 15/0 (1.4) GT vs MI LIVE: Good first over Good first over by Mohammed Siraj. Just 6 runs come off it. Rohit Sharma and Jonny Bairstow with a couple of nice strokes through the off-side but denied by good fielding in the covers by GT. MI need to get a good powerplay, with Hardik taking the brave call of batting first.MI 6/0 (1) GT vs MI LIVE: Here come the players! The players are out in the middle. Led by Shubman Gill, they walk past the fireworks go off. Jonny Bairstow is out to open for MI, coming in as the direct replacement of Ryan Rickelton. Rohit Sharma is opening at the other end.

GT vs MI LIVE: GT Playing XI Gujarat Titans XI vs MI: Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill, Kusal Mendis (wk), Washington Sundar, Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, R Sai Kishore, Gerald Coetzee, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna.Mendis replaces Buttler, who has gone for international duty.

GT vs MI LIVE: \"MI will win,\" says AB GT vs MI LIVE: Suryakumar eyeing huge record Suryakumar Yadav is eyeing a massive record set by AB de Villiers. Having been MI's most consistent batter this year, SKY has already smashed 640 runs in IPL 2025.

On the other hand, MI will be captained by Hardik Pandya, who will lead against his former franchise. IPL 2025 Eliminator LIVE: GT eyeing second title Gujarat Titans are a franchise that's only 4 years old. But already, they have two IPL finals and one IPL title to their name. Can they go the distance once again? Just like MI, they also need to win three matches in a row to make it happen. GT vs MI LIVE: MI eyeing title no. 6 Mumbai Indians are eyeing a record sixth title. For captain Rohit Sharma, he's eyeing his 7th IPL trophy, something that no IPL player in history has done. But for that to happen, they will need to win 3 games in a row. Defeat today, and that dream will end in 2025. GT vs MI LIVE: Qualifier 2 the target The winner of today's match will qualify for Qualifier 2, where they will play Punjab Kings for a place in the final. The loser today will be eliminated from the tournament. Just to recap, Royal Challengers Bengaluru are already in the final, after they beat PBKS in Qualifier 1 yesterday!
