On this day last year, Team India ended their 11-year-long trophy drought as a match-winning half-century from Virat Kohli and a brilliant pace choke by Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, and Hardik Pandya helped them beat South Africa by seven runs at Barbados in the T20 WC final to capture their second marquee T20 title.Remembering that day, Shukla wrote on his X handle, \"June 29, 2024, was a night to remember forever. After 11 long years, India finally won an ICC trophy, lifting the T20 World Cup with pride and passion.
