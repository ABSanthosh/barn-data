  "text": "Third T20, Centurion South Africa 124 (20 overs): Shangase 31 (35); Dean 3-26England 128-1 (11.3 overs): Wyatt-Hodge 53* (31), Bouchier 35 (21)England win by nine wickets; win series 3-0ScorecardEngland secured a dominant clean sweep in the three-match T20 series against South Africa with a nine-wicket win in Centurion. The tourists raced to their below-par target of 125 with 51 balls to spare, opener Danni Wyatt-Hodge finishing unbeaten on 53 and Sophia Dunkley making 24 not out.Wyatt-Hodge faced just 31 balls for her second successive T20 half-century in a brutal assault on South Africa's depleted bowling line-up, while the hosts also dropped five catches.Maia Bouchier was England's only wicket to fall, brilliantly caught by Nondumiso Shangase for 35 from 21 balls, after a ruthless opening stand of 56 in 5.4 overs.The hosts, who were without captain Laura Wolvaardt because of illness, slumped to 45-5 before they were rescued by a stand of 52 between all-rounders Nadine de Klerk and Shangase.They eventually scrambled to 124 from their 20 overs, off-spinner Charlie Dean leading England's fine all-round effort with 3-26 and a run-out.After England captain Heather Knight chose to bowl first, seamers Lauren Filer and Lauren Bell exposing a weakened South Africa line-up by removing openers Anneke Bosch and Faye Tunnicliffe in the first two overs. The promising Annerie Dercksen and experienced Sune Luus both wasted promising starts before stand-in captain Chloe Tryon fell softly for just one, with Shangase and De Klerk saving their side from a complete collapse.The series continues with three one-day internationals, starting on Wednesday, 4 December in Kimberley. Last month, England crashed out of the T20 World Cup in disappointing circumstances and came into this series with a serious point to prove, especially given the Women's Ashes is on the horizon.Albeit against an under-strength South Africa, they have rediscovered their confidence, with Wyatt-Hodge embodying their positive and fearless approach. Following her brutal 78 in the second T20 in Benoni, the opener made the most of another good pitch with true bounce to smash 10 fours and a six in her knock.She finished the series with 142 runs in three innings, while Dunkley also made a welcome contribution at number three after a lean run of form and spells in and out of the side.England are building in the short term with an eye on the Ashes. Filer's lively pace and bounce has stood out despite her only taking one wicket, while Dean's tally of six in three games is another pleasing element after she had an indifferent World Cup. South Africa, in contrast, are building long-term with the next T20 World Cup 18 months away and have opted to rotate several players throughout this series to give their younger squad members more exposure.It has not worked in terms of the results - they have been thoroughly outplayed and their fielding in particular requires serious improvement. But England can expect a much tougher assignment in the ODI series as Marizanne Kapp and Ayabonga Khaka return, with the next 50-over World Cup also starting in September next year.Player of the match, England spinner Charlie Dean: \"I am starting to come into my own and feeling more confident in the powerplay.\"If I can keep getting wickets and doing what I do best, it will help us get the win.\"Stand-in South Africa captain Chloe Tryon: \"We were outplayed. They have had an excellent series and we didn't play our best.\"It is hard to find energy when you are two-nil down. We were disappointed with how we bowled but we will try to get some momentum in the ODI series.\"England captain Heather Knight: \"Really pleasing to have that dominant performance, bouncing back from the World Cup. We challenged the girls to be really free, and they've done that, particularly with the batting.\"We've taken the learnings and how we want to move forward with clarity. We've been really dominant and improved in each facet, which has been really pleasing.\"",
