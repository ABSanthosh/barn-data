Gould subsequently wrote to the International Cricket Council urging the body “to intervene and show global leadership” in response to “the gender apartheid facing the 14 million women in Afghanistan”. Regarding calls for a boycott, Gould pushed back, arguing that a “coordinated, ICC-led approach would be significantly more impactful than unilateral actions by individual members”.Asked if he and his players had been involved in conversations with the ECB, Buttler, the England white‑ball captain, said: “Political situations like this, as a player you’re trying to be as informed as you can be. The experts know a lot more about it, so I’ve been trying to stay in dialogue with Rob Key [the ECB men’s managing director] and the guys above to see how they see it. I don’t think a boycott is the way to go about it.“The players haven’t really worried too much about it. You’re trying to educate yourself and read up on these things. There’s been some good stuff written about it that I’ve tapped into and I’ve spoken to quite a few people to try and gather expert opinion. I’m led by those experts on situations like this, but as a player you don’t want political situations to affect sport. We hope to go to the Champions Trophy and play that game and have a really good tournament.”Lisa Nandy, the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, has called for the game to go ahead. “I’m instinctively very cautious about boycotts in sports, partly because I think they’re counterproductive,” she told BBC Breakfast. “They deny sports fans the opportunity that they love and they can also very much penalise the athletes and the sportspeople who work very, very hard to reach the top of their game and then they’re denied the opportunities to compete. They are not the people that we want to penalise for the appalling actions of the Taliban against women and girls.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionEngland begin a five-match Twenty20 international series against India on Wednesday in Kolkata, marking the start of Brendon McCullum’s reign as all-format head coach.
