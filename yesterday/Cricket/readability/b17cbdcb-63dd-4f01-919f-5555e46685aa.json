Still, they never shy away from the requisite hard graft, leaning once more into the breeze and up the hill with devoted zeal. They’re as rare as pangolins in Test cricket and are all but extinct in white-ball formats on the international circuit. They are the medium-paced seamers.They used to be everywhere in the 1990s and 2000s, bowling heavy balls on probing lengths with ring fields. Their most fertile breeding ground was in New Zealand, where Chris Harris, Nathan Astle and Scott Styris led the way, but there were others. Hansie Cronje, Steve Waugh, Saurav Ganguly, Phil Simmons, Paul Collingwood, Andrew Symonds, Adam Hollioake; you could select a side comprising only those who wouldn’t get the new ball for your local club’s first XI and still have a decent shot at winning a World Cup.Now they feel like an anachronism. According to CricViz no seamer who bowls below an average speed of 125km/h has taken more than 50 Test wickets over the past 10 years. The closest are Pakistan’s Mohammed Abbas, who clocks in at 126km/h, and Jason Holder and Vernon Philander, who each average 127km/h. But they don’t count.All three are among the top four wicket-taking seamers in Tests for their countries over the past 20 years. Holder’s 6ft 7in is a weapon on its own and means he just has to land the ball on a spot to cause trouble at the other end of the pitch. Philander and Abbas are human metronomes, experts of the wobble ball with averages around 23 in Test cricket. These are the exceptions that prove the rule.So, where did they all go, those sidling seamers? The short answer is that they were hunted out of existence. In their heyday, medium pacers had the luxury of bowling wicket-to-wicket lines, often with the wicketkeeper standing up, with a slew of fielders protecting the boundary. Batters were content to nudge and nurdle them around the park as they meandered through the middle overs of one-day internationals or the hour before a break in Tests.Paul Collingwood celebrates a wicket for Durham in 2015. Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesEverything changed in 2005. The 50-over game saw the introduction of three powerplays, which increased the number of overs with fielding restrictions. That same year the first T20 international was staged and a new generation of batters began to rethink the limitations of their forebears. They started to hit through the line and over the top with greater frequency. Thicker bats, harder decks and the use of two new balls made it easier to play lofted drives and pick-ups off the pads. Batters, once stationary, moved around their crease, making it impossible to settle on line and length. The margin for error was atomised for any bowler who couldn’t crank up their speed or bewitch with an arsenal of spin options.Then there were the cultural shifts. By this stage speed guns were regular fixtures at grounds and the shortcomings of some bowlers were laid bare. It was almost embarrassing to see your hero give it his all but barely nudge the dial past 110km/h. Batters, selectors, captains and the rest of us woke up to the realisation that these anthropomorphised bowling machines could simply be thwacked into orbit.As they say in Pakistan – unsurprisingly the only Test nation without a standout trundler – “pace is pace”. It’s easy to understand how the potent mix of fear and awe has warped the discourse. Between now and England’s away Ashes at the end of the year we’ll hear how Ben Stokes’s attack lacks speed. We’ll wonder if Mark Wood and Jofra Archer can hold their bodies together for one final salvo. We’ll question if Ollie Robinson has the oomph to lead the assault, forgetting that Jimmy Anderson was England’s leading wicket taker the last time the side won in Australia.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThankfully there’s a haven where the endangered medium-man can find joy.

Darren Stevens is the alpha of these betas, a legend who sent down 31,595 dobblers across 326 first-class matches over a 25-year career.
