  "text": "Indian Premier League 2025Delhi Capitals 188-5 (20 overs): Porel 49 (37); Archer 2-32Rajasthan Royals 188-4 (20 overs): Rana 51 (28); Axar 1-23 Match tied - Delhi Capitals won the super overScorecard, TableDelhi Capitals beat Rajasthan Royals after the first super over of the 2025 IPL to go top of the table. With 12 needed from the super over, Tristan Stubbs whacked Sandeep Sharma's fourth ball for six to seal the victory. Rajasthan were guilty of wasting one delivery of Mitchell Starc's preceding over, as only two wickets are allowed per super over and Riyan Parag and Yashasvi Jaiswal were both run out. Starc got away with bowling a no-ball that also went for four, while Rajasthan made the curious choice to overlook Nitish Rana for the decider after he had scored 51 from 28 balls in the first innings.The super over came after Rajasthan needed nine from Australian seamer Starc's final over in pursuit of 189 to win, but with two needed from the final ball, Dhruv Jurel was run out coming back for an optimistic second run. Jaiswal's 51 at the top of the order and Rana's entertaining knock had put Rajasthan in a strong position before the latter was pinned lbw by Starc's trademark yorker in the 18th over - with 28 runs still needed - to keep Delhi in the game before he then nailed his final over. Delhi's 188-5 was set up by opener Abishek Porel's 49 followed by contributions from KL Rahul with 38, while Stubbs made an unbeaten 34 from 18 balls and captain Axar Patel added 34 from 14. England seamer Jofra Archer took 2-32 for Rajasthan.Delhi have now won five of their first six matches while struggling Rajasthan have lost five of their seven.",
