His review will also mean identifying a successor to Jos Buttler as white-ball captain.Harry Brook, the vice-captain, has endured a tough start to the year and, as a three-format player, his stepping up could leave the 26‑year‑old overburdened. Other candidates may not even be in the squad that has flopped, with McCullum ruling nothing out when asked about proven domestic leaders such as Sam Billings, Sam Curran and James Vince.“If it is the same person [for ODIs and Twenty20], great, if it’s two, that’s great too,” said the head coach, who has struck up a strong alliance with Ben Stokes in the Test setup. “Give me a couple of weeks to work it out and get this thing back on track.”The notion of three captains – last occurring between 2011 and 2012 when Andrew Strauss (Tests), Alastair Cook (ODIs) and Stuart Broad (T20s) were briefly a triumvirate – would be a messy one. It would cut across McCullum’s belief that the best cricketers should be able to transfer across squads, with England’s schedule now starting to ease.In that respect McCullum was unrepentant about merging the 50-over team with the more successful Test side for this Champions Trophy, noting that Ben Duckett (227 runs) and Joe Root (225) were England’s two highest scorers. The same went for banking on high pace in the bowling attack at the expense of greater variety, even if this failed.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“We may not have got it totally right this time but you’ve got to have conviction in something,” said the New Zealander, when asked about the strategy that went awry. “We’ve got to put our hands up and acknowledge it wasn’t good enough.“We’re a little further down the road with [the Test team]. It’s not hard to see this is a slightly different task and we’ve got to put plans in place for the demands of white-ball.“But I still have tremendous confidence in the talent that is across English cricket, not just in the dressing room right now, but also guys around the domestic scene at the moment or have played for England before. We’ve got to find ways to make sure that our team walks out there a lot more confident than we are at the moment.”On Buttler, who has no intention of retiring from international duty, McCullum added: “We still see him as a big player within that and he’s still got a huge role to play. But it will be an exciting time for the new captain to put their stamp on it.”",
