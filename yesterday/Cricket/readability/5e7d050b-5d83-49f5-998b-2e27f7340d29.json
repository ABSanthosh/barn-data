Having struggled in those two matches, Richie Berrington's bowlers delivered a fine performance after UAE opted to bat first. Sussex seamer Brad Currie and new-ball partner Brandon McMullen took three wickets apiece, while McMullen also claimed a run-out as Scotland dominated from the off.Only Muhammad Waseem (61) offered any resistance in a total of 161, hitting four fours and three sixes before he was bowled by McMullen.In reply, George Munsey continued his fine form at the top of the order with 56 off just 45 balls to hammer home Scotland's advantage.McMullen then capped his fine outing with an unbeaten 50, becoming the fastest Scotland batter to reach 1,000 one-day international runs in the process.He put on 60 with captain Berrington as Scotland reached their target with 25.4 overs to spare.\"Conditions suited me today with the ball,\" McMullen said. \"Very happy to contribute to the team's success today. \"It's been a bit frustrating the past couple of games with the bat, luckily today I went all the way through.\"It's a massive honour and privilege to hold that record and hopefully it gets broken in the future.\"Scotland have with eight wins from 15 matches in CWCL2 before Friday's match against the table-topping Netherlands.",
