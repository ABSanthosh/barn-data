Kashif Ali sliced a big swing to deep cover before Adam Hose was bowled aiming to drive his first ball.Brookes scooped Pat Brown for six but at the end of the powerplay, the Rapids needed a big recovery at 35 for 4.Brookes and Roderick combined placement with improvisation to take 33 from the next three overs and at the halfway stage, the Rapids had moved to 75 for 4.Brookes pulled Brown for six but was bowled by Samit Patel going for another big shot in the 13th over.Roderick reached 50 off 46 balls - his first in T20 after 14 years and 50 innings - and then swept Thomson for six. He dispatched Chappell for another maximum but was bowled making room to drive.Dwarshuis drove Brown over cover for six and with 35 coming from the last two overs, the Rapids had posted a competitive total.After equalling the fastest Blast fifty on Sunday, Aneurin Donald was caught behind down the leg side without scoring and Harry Came played on to Tom Taylor in the third over.Caleb Jewell pulled Dwarshuis for six but was bowled trying to drive his fellow Australian to leave the Falcons on 29 for 3.Madsen swung Adam Finch for six but the Falcons lost Patel in the ninth over when he pulled Finch to deep midwicket.After 10 overs the Falcons were 70 for 4 but Madsen and Whiteley added 47 from 33 balls before Whiteley was bowled by Fateh Singh.Madsen drove Taylor for six to reach 50 from 35 balls and Martin Andersson pulled Shahzad over the midwicket boundary to leave the Falcons needing 36 from 18 balls.Andersson was run out going for a second and the Falcons needed 21 off the last over which proved too much even for Madsen.Get latest cricket updates on WhatsApp",
