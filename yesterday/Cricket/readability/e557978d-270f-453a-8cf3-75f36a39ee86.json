While Cummins and Head, who play for Sunrisers Hyderabad and are out of playoff contention, have just three games left, an extended run beyond the regular season is still possible for the teams of Inglis, Starc and Marsh.Given the delay in the IPL – the rescheduled final will now be played on 3 June, just a week before the start of the WTC final in London – CA is now faced with a potential logistical conundrum, but a spokesperson said the safety of players was paramount.“Following the announcement that the IPL will resume on Saturday, Cricket Australia will support players in their individual decisions whether to return to India or not,” a CA spokesperson said.“Team management will work through preparation implications for the World Test Championship final for those players who choose to play in the remaining IPL matches. We are maintaining communication with the Australian government and BCCI around security arrangements and safety.”The IPL match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals is called off due to concerns over the India and Pakistan conflict.

Healy said it was “a surreal experience”.“There was a lot of anxiety around the Australian group because we didn’t have a whole heap of information as to what was going on,” Healy said on The Willow podcast. “That’s probably the scariest part of this whole situation, the misinformation.“[We were] quite close to what’s being fought over, but we were assured, ‘Everything was fine, everything is OK. It’s miles away, the game will go ahead and everything will be fine’.“At the end of the day, they evacuated the stadium as a precaution, which was fine, but it was probably a little bit too close for comfort.”The escalating tensions forced the BCCI to put the tournament on hold, but it is now slated to recommence on 17 May local time.“After extensive consultations with government and security agencies, and with all the key stakeholders, the board has decided to proceed with the remainder of the season,” the BCCI said in a statement.",
