However, the race for top-2 finish among the teams continues. The sides for playoff have been finalised but their positions are yet to be decided. We still have 7 league matches remaining. Stay tuned to NDTV Sports. Goodbye. MI vs DC Live: Mumbai Indians enter playoffs! Jasprit Bumrah cleans up Mustafizur Rahman and this sees Mumbai Indians defeat Delhi Capitals by 59 runs and take the fourth and final playoff spot in IPL 2025. It was a clinical show from MI! They shone in batting through Suryakumar Yadav's unbeaten 73 before bundling out DC for a mere 121. What a performance! MI vs DC Live: OUT! Kuldeep Yadav is gone! He jumped out of his crease and hit the Karn Sharma delivery high in the air. Substitute fielder Raj Bawa took the catch. Mumbai Indians only one wicket away from sealing a spot in the playoffs. They are almost there. It's just a matter of time.DC 120/8 (17.5) MI vs DC Live: Mumbai Indian on brink of playoff spot! Trent Boult finishes his quota of four overs with figures of 1 for 29. Delhi Capitals need 66 more to win in 18 balls. Mumbai Indians still need two wickets to win. They have one foot in the playoffs. Just formality remains in this game.DC 115/8 (17) MI vs DC Live: WICKET! Jasprit Bumrah strikes! He has cleaned up Madhav Tiwari with a slower delivery and Mumbai Indians are now only two wickets away from sealing a playoff spot. The umpire call for strategic time-out here. 8-down DC need a miracle from here to stay alive in playoff race. They need 73 in 27 balls to win this game. DC 108/8 (15.3) MI vs DC Live: OUT! Mitchell Santner has dismissed Ashutosh Sharma. It was a superbly bowled delivery and that brought Ashutosh Sharma on the front foot. The ball spun viciously and Ryan Rickelton did the rest behind the stumps. Ashutosh fell for 18 runs off 16 balls.DC 104/7 (14.5) MI vs DC Live: WICKET! Delhi Capitals are six down! Sameer Rizvi went for a sweep shot but Mitchell Santner bowled it really slow. Rizvi missed the ball and that hit the stumps. He is out for 39 off 35 balls. Delhi Capitals need 78 runs in 34 balls. The asking rate has gone close to 14 for them now.DC 103/6 (14.2) MI vs DC Live: Mumbai Indians keep it tight! Only two singles came off the third over from Mitchell Santner. Delhi Capitals need 97 runs in 48 balls. They are already five down. This is Mumbai Indians' game to lose from this point and the history that this team has, you rarely see it losing such crucial matches.DC 84/5 (12) MI vs DC Live: SIX! A fuller ball from Karn Sharma outside off-stump and Ashutosh Sharma has smoked it over the long-off for a biggie. This was an expensive over from Karn Shrama as 16 runs came off it. There was also one dropped catch in the over and Will Jacks was the player who gave life to Sameer Rizvi. Delhi Capitals need 99 runs in 54 balls.DC 82/5 (11) MI vs DC Live: What an over! This is what Jasprit Bumrah is all about! It seemed he was not at his best in the previous over but look at him here, he was simply unmatched. Just one run came in the over and a wicket. Delhi Capitals need 115 runs in 60 balls.DC 66/5 (10) MI vs DC Live: WICKET! OUT! Tristan Stubbs is gone! That was an inswinging delivery from Jasprit Bumrah and Stubbs missed it. The ball hit his front pad and umpire raised his finger over the appeal for an LBW. Stubbs decided to review it only to waste it as the ball-tracking suggested that it would have hit the leg stump. Mumbai Indians are bossing this game now.DC 65/5 (9.2)  MI vs DC Live: SIX! Spinner Karn Sharma, who was brought in as impact sub for Rohit Sharma, was handed the ball and he leaked 10 runs in his first over. Only four singles came off the first five balls before Sameer Rizvi smashed the final ball for a six over the long-off.DC 65/4 (9) MI vs DC Live: OUT! Vipraj Nigam is gone!!! That was a much-deserved wicket for Mitchell Santner. The ball was gripping and turning really well off the surface and that eventually saw Vipraj Nigam handing an easy catch to Santner. Vipraj is out for 20 off 11 balls. DC 55/4 (8) MI vs DC Live: Not impressive from Bumrah! Jasprit Bumrah was brought into the attack but he didn't look as good as his usual self in his first over. He bowled a short ball down the leg side to Sameer Rizvi that went for a four. He even bowled a lower full toss to the batter on the final ball but was lucky to get away with a single. Five runs came off the over.DC 54/3 (7) MI vs DC Live: Catch dropped! Rohit Sharma has made a massive blunde here. He has dropped the catch of Vipraj Nigam at short third. Vipraj got the outside edge on the ball of Mitchell Santner but Rohit dropped the easy chance. Delhi Capitals need 132 runs in 84 balls.DC 49/3 (6) MI vs DC Live: Jacks proves to be EXPENSIVE! Will Jacks concedes 16 runs in his first over. He claimed the wicket of Abhishek Porel on the second ball of the over but then Delhi Capitals sent Vipraj Nigam and the right-handed batter slammed the spinner for two fours and a six.DC 43/3 (5) MI vs DC Live: WICKET! Will Jacks strikes in his very first over and he gets the wicket of Abhishek Porel! Delhi Capitals are in real trouble here. It was an off-spin from Jacks and Porel missed his shot. Ryan Rickelton clipped off the bails with Porel losing his balance a bit during that shot. It was a tight call but TV umpire felt that Porel's foot was in the air when the stumping took place.  DC 27/3 (4.2) MI vs DC Live: Mumbai Indians keep it tight! Only 7 runs came off Deepak Chahar's second over. Mumbai Indians are playing in a typical fashion in this crucial game. They are keeping it really tight here. This pitch is not that easy to bat on and dew has also not settled on the ground yet.DC 27/2 (4) MI vs DC Live: OUT! KL Rahul is gone! That is a massive blow for Delhi Capitals! Rahul came out of his crease and tried to play the ball on the off side but lost his wicket. He ended up edging that ball to MI wicketkeeper Ryan Rickelton. Rahul is gone for 11 off 6 balls. DC 20/2 (2.4) MI vs DC Live: End of successful over! This is a superb start for Deepak Chahar! He conceded only four runs in the over and claimed the wicket of Faf du Plessis. Mumbai Indians just need to keep it tight and not leak runs.DC 14/1 (2) MI vs DC Live: WICKET! Faf du Plessis is gone for 6 runs off 7 balls! He has played this down into the hands of Mitchell Santner at long-on. Delhi Capitals cop an early blow here and Deepak Chahar is the man who strikes. DC 12/1 (1.4) MI vs DC Live: 10 runs off the first over! KL Rahul got thick outside edge on the first ball of the over but he was lucky that it flew wide of the short third for a four. Later in the over, Faf du Plessis played a beautiful punch shot through the wide of cover for a four. 10 runs came off the over. DC 10/0 (1) MI vs DC Live: The chase begins! KL Rahul is on the strike, Faf du Plessis is at the other end. Trent Boult is ready with the ball in hand. Here we go... MI vs DC Live: Majestic from Suryakumar Yadav! While it was Naman Dhir in the previous over, this one belonged to Suryakumar Yadav and his brilliance. The right-handed batter smashed Dushmantha Chameera for two fours and as many sixes in the over. 21 runs came in it and Mumbai Indians now have at least a fighting total on the board.MI 180/5 (20) MI vs DC Live: Massive over!!! Mukesh Kumar has leaked 27 runs in his final over. He was truly economical before this, conceding just 21 runs with two wickets in the three overs, but this over has put MI back in the game. Suryakumar Yadav hit a six on the first ball of the over before Naman Dhir smashed two fours and as many sixes.MI 159/5 (19) MI vs DC Live: Fifty for Suryakumar Yadav! Suryakumar Yadav slams a beautiful six over the extra cover and races to his half-century with it. He gets there in 35 balls. This has been a superb knock from the right-handed MI batter, but the job is not done yet as 11 more deliveries are remaining in this MI innings and he needs to take the side to a fighting total.MI 138/5 (18.1) MI vs DC Live: Delhi Capitals keep it tight! That is a superb over from Mustafizur Rahman. He conceded only 6 runs in it despite conceding a four in it. Delhi Capitals continue to tighten the noose on Mumbai Indians, who are struggling to even go past 150.MI 132/5 (18) MI vs DC Live: Hardik is OUT! Hardik Pandya is OUT! That was a good length ball outside off-stump and Hardik wanted to play a lofted drive. He ended up edging the ball to Mukesh Kumar at backward point. This is a huge blow to Mumbai Indians as Hardik plays a huge role in scoring quick runs for the side in slog overs. MI 123/5 (16.3) MI vs DC Live: Excellent bowling! Kuldeep Yadav has finished his quota of four overs with figures of 1 for 22. Both Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav were happy playing the spinner carefully. Four more overs remaining in the innings for MI. They should score 40 to 50 runs at least in that to post a fighting total against DC.MI 118/4 (16) MI vs DC Live: WICKET! Tilak Varma is out for run-a-ball 27. He has slammed the short ball of Mukesh Kumar right into the hands of long-on. The 55-run partnership has been finally broken. Mukesh gets the much-deserved wicket and Mumbai Indians are four down.MI 113/4 (14.5) MI vs DC Live: Delhi Capitals lose review! 14.3 - Suryakumar Yadav went for a sweep shot on the third ball of Mukesh Kumar's over. MI vs DC Live: SIX! Several attempts and Suryakumar Yadav finally manages to get one from the middle of his bat. He came down the track and slammed the Mustafizur Rahman delivery down the ground for a biggie. A single folllowed it. 9 runs came off the over.MI 108/3 (14) MI vs DC Live: Mumbai need to accelerate! Only four runs came off Kuldeep Yadav's third over. Mumbai Indians have 7 more overs remaining in this innings, they need to acclerate a bit to get close to 200 or surpass it. The five-time champions have good firepower down the order and they need to make it count here. MI 99/3 (13) MI vs DC Live: Good from Vipraj! Five runs came off Vipraj Nigam's final over. He ends his quota of four overs with figures of 0 for 25. He failed to get any wicket but didn't leak runs, meanwhile. It was a tidy spell from the spinner despite not much support from the surface. MI 95/3 (12) MI vs DC Live: SIX! Tilak Varma hit Dushmantha Chameera for a six on the fifth ball of the over. He followed it up with a single. A total of 10 runs came off the over. This is turning out to be a good partnership for Mumbai Indians as the duo of Tilak and Suryakumar have stitched 32 runs off 26 balls for the fourth wicket so far.MI 90/3 (11) MI vs DC Live: FOUR! It was a short length ball from Vipraj Nigam that skid off the surface. Tilak Varma went on the back foot to hit it on the leg side but got an inside edge on it. The ball missed the wicketkeeper's gloves and ran away for a four. 7 runs came off the over. MI 80/3 (10) MI vs DC Live: MI need to rebuild! Only five runs came off the second over from Kuldeep Yadav. Delhi Capitals have managed to pull this game back with double strikes. Mukesh Kumar removed Will Jacks before Kuldeep Yadav got the better of set batter Ryan Rickelton.MI 73/3 (9) MI vs DC Live: WICKET! Mumbai Indians lose another wicket! Ryan Rickelton has been dismissed for 25 off 18 balls. He tried to play a sweep shot, got a top-edge that went into the hands of Madhav Tiwari at deep square leg. Mumbai are in a bit of trouble here.MI 58/3 (6.4) MI vs DC Live: OUT! Will Jacks is gone! Mukesh Kumar has dismissed the MI batter, who was looking really good. Vipraj Nigam took a really good catch while running behind from mid-off. Jacks is out for 21 off 13 balls.MI 48/2 (5.3) MI vs DC Live: FOUR, FOUR! Vipraj Nigam was brought into the attack and he ended up leaking two fours in it. Two poor short balls and Will Jacks pulled both of them over the in-field to score boundaries towards the cow corner. 9 runs came off the over.MI 34/1 (4) MI vs DC Live: WICKET! Rohit Sharma is gone! It was a fuller delivery bowled outside off stump from Mustafizur Rahman and Rohit tried to go for a big one. He ended up getting a thick outside edge on it that carried to DC wicketkeeper Abhishek Porel. Rohit is out for run-a-ball 5.MI 23/1 (2.2) MI vs DC Live: Expensive over! Dushmantha Chameera has gone really expensive in his first over. He has leaked 15 runs. Bowling fuller deliveries proved costly for him. Mustafizur Rahman has been brought into the attack.MI 22/0 (2) MI vs DC Live: SIX! SIX! A fuller ball from Dushmantha Chameera and Ryan Rickelton has smashed it right down the ground for a biggie. The next ball has its length dragged back a bit but the result is the same - a SIX! Sensational hitting this is from Rickelton. MI vs DC Live: FOUR! Mukesh Kumar bowled a fuller delivery outside off stump to Rohit Shama. The right-handed batter played a lofted drive over the mid-off for a classy four. A total of seven runs came for Mumbai Indians off the first over.MI 7/0 (1) MI vs DC Live: Match begins! Mukesh Kumar with the new ball in hand. Ryan Rickelton is on the strike, Rohit Sharma is at the other end. Here we go... Mukesh starts with a fuller swinging delivery and Rickelton played it on the leg side, at mid wicket, for a single. MI vs DC Live: Pitch report here - \"We love the Wankhede. What we love about today also is that the sun is out because I planned to kinda go on \"Rain, rain go away, come back another day,\" because everybody's been talking about the fact there would be rain. It's a good thing there isn't. Let's have a look at the dimensions for today, we are just about in the middle. Square - 62m and 63m, so not much difference there and 72m straight. What about the 22 yards? Thank you sun, it's lovely and as we look, it's really baked this wicket out as well. You could be actually thinking there's not a lot of grass on this, there's some patches here but it's actually the grass is very well rolled into it. A slightly different colour (on a fuller length) versus in here (good length), this to me looks like the groundsman has topped it up with a little bit of extra moisture to hold it all together. I suspect that the off-pace deliveries especially from the seamers are going to be a little tricky. If you lose the toss, you'll probably be having to put the bat in the hand and you got to get 200, simple as that. But you want to chase because there's been four out of the six games that have been won chasing. Expect a bit of dew this evening because it's very humid,\" said Mpumelelo Mbangwa and Matthew Hayden while talking about the pitch. MI vs DC Live: Here are the Impact subs - Delhi Capitals Impact Subs: KL Rahul, Sediqullah Atal, Karun Nair, Tripurana Vijay, Manvanth Kumar LMumbai Indians Impact Subs: Karn Sharma, Corbin Bosch, Raj Bawa, Ashwani Kumar, Satyanarayana Raju MI vs DC Live: Here are the Playing XIs - Delhi Capitals (Playing XI): Faf du Plessis(c), Abishek Porel(w), Sameer Rizvi, Ashutosh Sharma, Tristan Stubbs, Dushmantha Chameera, Vipraj Nigam, Madhav Tiwari, Kuldeep Yadav, Mustafizur Rahman, Mukesh KumarMumbai Indians (Playing XI): Ryan Rickelton(w), Rohit Sharma, Will Jacks, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya(c), Naman Dhir, Mitchell Santner, Deepak Chahar, Trent Boult, Jasprit Bumrah MI vs DC Live: Hardik announces one change for MI - \"It's been under covers for a couple of days. We would have liked to bowl as well, but it's okay. Every game is important from now onwards, we want to play our best cricket. The boys are very excited. (Best yet to come?) Yes, definitely, I don't think we've had a complete game. They (crowd) have been fantastic. They have backed us even when we weren't on a roll. One change, Mitch comes, back, Bosch misses out,\" said MI captain Hardik Pandya. MI vs DC Live: Axar Patel unwell! \"(On Axar) Really sick in the last two days. We'll miss him today. Playing a good team today, we are up for it. We haven't been at our best in the last 5-6 games. Everyday there's a new opportunity. Looks a bit dry, we're chasing. Axar is not there, Axar is two players and it's difficult to replace him. We'll see how it goes,\" said DC's stand-in captain Faf du Plessis. MI vs DC Live: Delhi Capitals to bowl first! Faf du Plessis came as a stand-in captain for Delhi Capitals as Axar Patel is unwell. Faf won the toss and elected to bowl first. This means that Mumbai Indians will be batting first in this much-crucial game. MI vs DC Live: Small clouds in Mumbai! As per the latest weather update, there are just small clouds in Mumbai. The sky is nearly clear, which means the rain is likely to not impact the game. Let's hope this is what actually happens as IPL 2025 gears up for this crucial match between MI and DC. We are nearly 10 minutes away from the toss. MI vs DC Live: A look at stars for both teams - Suryakumar Yadav is the leading run-scorer for Mumbai Indians with 510 runs to his name from 12 matches. Trent Boult tops the wicket-takers' chart for MI with 18 scalps to his name. For Delhi Capitals, KL Rahul (493 runs in 11 matches) is the top run-scorer. The highest wicket-taker for DC is Mitchell Starc (14 wickets from 11 games) but he the pacer decided not to return to India when IPL resumed. MI vs DC Live: An interesting fact! Delhi Capitals started IPL 2025 by winning four matches on the trot. Their winning run was put to an end by none other than Mumbai Indians. Tonight is a great chance for DC to spoil the party for MI and throw the team at the brink of elimination, thus completing a perfect revenge. Better said than done, though! MI vs DC Live: A good news! While rain threat loomed over the Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals game, there is a good news that the sky is clear at the moment. It is blue. Accroding to the current weather, we shall have a complete 20-overs-a-side match at Wankhede Stadium. MI vs DC Live: A must-win game! While a win in this game will ensure Mumbai Indians the fourth and only remaining playoff spot, a victory of Delhi Capitals will mean that the side will almost get through. If MI win this contest, they will reach 16 points, which in that case, DC would not be able to achieve. On the other hand, if DC win this match, they will get to 15 points. In that scenario, MI have to register a victory and hope for DC to lose their final game to make it to the playoffs. MI vs DC Live: Welcome! Hello folks, welcome to the live coverage of the MI vs DC IPL 2025 match! This is a must-win match for both teams. the fourth IPL playoff spot may be decided with the outcome of this match.
