  "text": "ReutersAshwin in action in the second Test against Australia at Adelaide earlier this monthRavichandran Ashwin, one of cricket's most celebrated spinners, stunned the cricketing world on Wednesday by announcing his retirement, leaving fans and experts alike grappling with the abruptness of his decision.Known for his innovative bowling and razor-sharp cricketing mind, 38-year-old Ashwin's departure in the middle of a Test series against Australia has sparked admiration and debate in equal measure.Tributes poured in from around the globe, with team-mates, cricket legends and fans hailing his contributions to the sport.Yet, the timing of his retirement also raised some eyebrows.Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar praised Ashwin's stellar career but expressed concern over his decision to retire midway through a crucial overseas series. With two matches still to be played, such a move could disrupt team selection dynamics, he said.Mid-series retirements aren't unprecedented in Indian cricket.In 2014, MS Dhoni also exited Test cricket abruptly, stepping down as India captain and player during a series in Australia. Ashwin's decision, however, has invited speculation: Was it age, fatigue, form, or frustration with team selection that led to his exit?AFPAshwin's artistry with the ball inspired generations of cricketers worldwideAshwin, India's leading spinner, had found himself sidelined on this tour, with Washington Sundar playing the first Test and Ravindra Jadeja the third, despite Ashwin featuring in the second.Perhaps sensing he was no longer the first-choice spinner, he saw limited prospects ahead, even if India reached the World Test Championship (WTC) final at Lord's in June.Regardless of the circumstances, Ashwin leaves behind an extraordinary legacy.With 537 Test wickets in 106 Tests and six centuries to his name, he ranks among the greatest all-rounders in cricket history. His artistry with the ball, including his mastery of the 'doosra' and the 'carrom ball redefined off-spin bowling, inspiring generations of cricketers worldwide.Ashwin's career statistics place him among the all-time greats.He is the fourth-highest wicket-taking spinner, behind only Muttiah Muralitharan (800), Shane Warne (708) and compatriot Anil Kumble (619), and seventh in the list of all wicket-takers.Ashwin's 37 five-wicket hauls put him behind only Muralitharan, who has 67.Ashwin is also among just five bowlers post World War Two who have averaged five or more wickets per Test, the others being Muralitharan, Dennis Lillee, Richard Hadlee and Yasir Shah.Getty ImagesWith 537 wickets in 106 Tests, Ashwin is the fourth-highest wicket-taking spinnerMore compellingly, of nine bowlers with 500-plus Test wickets, Ashwin's strike rate (50.73 balls per wicket) is the best.These are remarkable numbers for a player once seen as a white-ball specialist, rising to prominence with the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) starting in 2009.Ashwin's IPL success was instant, leading to his international debut for India in 2010 in ODIs and T20s.He was part of the 2011 World Cup-winning squad under MS Dhoni, serving as Harbhajan Singh's understudy. His white-ball exploits bolstered his reputation, but Ashwin's true greatness unfolded in Test cricket.When selected for his Test debut against West Indies in November 2011, sceptics claimed his inclusion was influenced by then chief of the Indian cricket board N Srinivasan, who also owned the CSK franchise in the IPL.Ashwin silenced critics with a stellar nine-wicket haul, being named man of the match and cementing his place in the team within a year. Spin bowling has been India's pride for decades, led by legends such as Bishan Singh Bedi, Erapalli Prasanna, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, and Srinivas Venkataraghavan, whose artistry secured historic series wins in the 1970s.Anil Kumble, with 619 wickets, proved that India's spin dominance extended to the modern era, followed by Harbhajan Singh, Ashwin, and Jadeja.Getty ImagesOriginally an opening bat, Ashwin's batting remained underrated yet effectiveTogether, Ashwin and Jadeja have amassed 856 wickets and over 6,500 runs, cementing India's dominance across formats.Ashwin's thirst for excellence was evident early in his career, learning alongside Sri Lanka legend Muralitharan at CSK.He constantly evolved, adding variations like the 'carrom ball' and occasional leg-spin to outfox batters. An engineer by qualification, he showed strong expertise for working on different angles and lengths to confound batsmen, preparing in advance for key batsmen and contests.During the 2020 pandemic, Ashwin fine-tuned his skills in Chennai, preparing to counter Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne in Australia. His efforts paid off.He was successful in stifling the prolific run-scoring of the two Australians, and also made vital contributions with bat to help India pull off a memorable triumph.Originally an opener, Ashwin's batting remained underrated but effective. With 3,503 runs, including six centuries, he established himself as a genuine all-rounder, often stepping up in critical moments.Getty ImagesAshwin (left) and former India players Sandeep Patil and VVS Laxman at a TV food showA fiercely independent thinker, Ashwin challenged cricketing conventions.He famously ran out England's Jos Buttler at the non-striker's end during the 2019 IPL, sparking global debate but compelling the cricket world to reassess the 'spirit of the game'. His efforts led to the removal of the term 'Mankading', which referred to a bowler running out a non-striker for leaving the crease too early - a rule associated with former India captain Vinoo Mankad, who faced decades of criticism for using it.An outstanding series against England earlier this year seemed to rejuvenate Ashwin's career. Despite modest returns in three Tests against New Zealand, his $1.16m IPL contract with CSK signalled his enduring value.In November, Ashwin headed to Australia as India's premier spinner, aiming to complete a hat-trick of series wins Down Under. Yet, by year's end, his sudden retirement left unanswered questions and a void that will be hard to fill.",
