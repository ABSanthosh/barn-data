Reports claim that a 70% stake has been agreed, 49% from the England and Wales Cricket Board with the rest from the county side.“We have been very focused on securing a great partner – ideally from the IPL – and RPSG has been our preferred bidder for some time,” read a statement from Lancashire. “We are delighted by the outcome and look forward to working together to create an exciting future. Together, we have a shared ambition to create a very special cricket team for the people of Manchester and the wider north west region.”RPSG’s successful bid comes after the owners of the Mumbai Indians landed a 49% share in Oval Invincibles on the opening day of the Hundred auction last week, worth around £60m. Northern Superchargers, Trent Rockets and Southern Brave remain on offer, with the sale of the Brave set to bring about further IPL involvement. GMR Group, the co-owners of Delhi Capitals, bought a majority stake in Hampshire last year.Hundred ownership will extend RPSG’s presence across short-form tournaments; aside from the Lucknow Super Giants, the Indian conglomerate owns Durban’s Super Giants who play in the SA20.Sanjiv Goenka, RPSG’s chairman, has taken on a public role in running the Lucknow side and was present alongside Rishabh Pant when the India wicketkeeper was unveiled as the franchise’s new captain last month.
