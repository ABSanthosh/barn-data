  "text": "NewsVeteran legspinner wants to help with rebuilding England's white-ball dynastyAdil Rashid speaks at a Net Gains event  •  IG / Nura Content At the age of 37 Adil Rashid is as hungry as ever to keep pushing himself and play his part in turning England's white-ball form around.Rashid retained his place as England's premier legspinner in the ODI and T20I squads to host West Indies from May 29.The series, starting with three ODIs, will be Harry Brook's first assignment as white-ball captain and an opportunity for England to arrest a seven-game losing streak in the format - they have lost nine of their last 10, including a winless Champions Trophy campaign, as well as four of their last five T20Is.\"I'm trying to go as long as I can if the body allows, but also form, making sure that I try my best and giving myself the best chance,\" Rashid said. \"I've still got the hunger to become the best and try my best and not just for myself, but from a team point of view, to win World Cups for the team and try to become the best team we can. That's what drives me at the moment.\"Right man, wrong time: Why Harry Brook had to be captain too soonHarry Brook to shelve franchise cricket as England captainWest Indies include Amir Jangoo, Jewel Andrew for Ireland, England ODIsEngland pick Dawson, Hartley and Carse for West Indies white-ball seriesButtler, Bethell and Jacks set to miss IPL playoffs Rashid was the leading ODI wicket-taker on England's tour of India which preceded the Champions Trophy with seven at 27.28, one ahead of Ravindra Jadeja and Harshit Rana. His crucial figures of 4-0-15-1 in the third T20I kept the series alive, although India ended up winning 4-1.Speaking at a suburban ground in London as part of the Net Gains initiative, Rashid attributed his longevity to his decision in 2018 to give up red-ball cricket.\"I think that's been the key,\" he said. \"And it's almost having priorities in life and sometimes when you are at that stage of knowing, 'okay, when can I play, when do I rest?' If I want to keep going for as long as I can then I know I've got to have that balance.\"If I just keep playing too much, you can burn out and finish your career where you don't want to be. So for my aim, the most important thing is having that balance in life.\"Another spinner the same side of his mid-thirties but having taken a different path is Liam Dawson, the left-arm orthodox allrounder named for the T20 leg of West Indies' visit where he could represent England for the first time since 2022.His selection came off the back of an extended run of form, including at the SA20 with two-time champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape and Hampshire, which led to him being named as one of Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year for 2024, when he claimed 54 Championship wickets and scored 956 runs at almost 60.Dawson made himself unavailable for selection on England's white-ball tour of Bangladesh in early 2023 to play for Lahore Qalandars in the PSL, and hinted at international retirement last year, but has now come full circle in a tale of not giving up.\"For him to come back now it shows determination, it shows his hunger to become the best and good on him,\" Rashid said. \"He's a lovely guy and he's a very, very good cricketer so I'm sure he'll do well for England when he plays.\"Dawson's selection - and Rashid's enduring influence for England - also speaks to a defiance in the face of inevitable questions as elite sportspeople approach 40.\"You've got some players who compete in their early forties,\" Rashid said. \"Look at Jimmy Anderson, he's 42, he's fit, he's going well and he's got that hunger. So it's all depending on the individual.\"But sometimes it can be the outside noise, right? You're hitting 35, 36, what you're looking to next. But in your mind still you're thinking, 'wait, I've still got another five, six years here. I feel good, I feel fit, I want to give my all. I'm still loving the game, I'm still hungry.' So there's a lot of factors taking place, but it can sometimes creep in.\"At the other end of the age spectrum Rashid expects Brook, Jos Buttler's 26-year-old replacement as skipper, to bring a positive outlook to the captaincy.\"As an individual he's quite a positive person, so I'm sure he'll bring that to the game,\" Rashid said. \"We as the squad, as a coaching staff as well, I think it'll be exciting to see what he brings to the table, but I'm sure he'll do wonders.\"He's been captain for Superchargers. He showed his qualities there and that was the first time he captained as well, so I'm sure as he captains more the better he will get. But you don't see it until he's done it. He's always been fairly quietish, I think generally, but confident, and that's what you need as a captain. You don't always have to be the loudest, you don't always have to be the one speaking, but if you're respected, well that's what you need.\"IG is the Official Investment Platform of England Cricket.
