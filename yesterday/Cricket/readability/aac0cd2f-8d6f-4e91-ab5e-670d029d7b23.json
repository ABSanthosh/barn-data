  "description": "A crazy weekend with one player playing two top class cricket matches on two different continents in the space of 24 hours, while one English club side win a match by 424 runs in half an afternoon. Simon Hughes and Simon Mann report on the madness of cricket and look at a slightly more sane weekend of county cricket action. Our live podcast in aid of Syd Lawrence is in Bristol on June 18.
