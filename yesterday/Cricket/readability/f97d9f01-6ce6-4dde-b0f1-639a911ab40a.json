  "text": "The International Cricket Council is set to delay plans to divide Test cricket into two divisions, with the next edition of the World Test Championship starting this summer to continue in a single-league format.The issue of two-tier Test cricket will be discussed at a series of ICC meetings in Zimbabwe this weekend but the Observer has been told that a proposal from Cricket Australia to move to two divisions will not be put to a vote.The ICC is understood to have concluded that more time is needed to consider the sporting and financial implications of what would be one of the most radical changes in Test cricket’s 133-year history, although it could return to the agenda when planning begins for the 2027-2029 cycle.Rather than expanding to two divisions of six by adding Afghanistan, Ireland and Zimbabwe to the WTC, the next edition running from this summer until 2027 will retain its existing nine-team format. In keeping with cricket’s congested schedule the next WTC begins with England’s five-Test home series against India in June, five days after the conclusion of the final between Australia and South Africa at Lord’s.The two-tier proposal emerged from meetings between Cricket Australia and the England and Wales Cricket Board during the women’s Ashes in January. Cricket Australia, in particular, is believed to be a major advocate of two divisions, as it would involve Australia, England and India playing against each other twice every three years rather than the current model of two series in four years and generate huge financial returns.The other Test-playing nations have concerns about falling even further behind the so-called big three and require more detail on financial redistribution and promotion and relegation before putting the proposal to a vote.The ICC could agree to other significant changes to the WTC, with amendments to the points system that determines qualification for the final to be discussed. A new system of bonus points for the margin of victory – similar to that used in rugby union – is being considered, while weighting points for wins based on the strength of opponents and adding extra points for winning away from home is also up for discussion.England cricket’s managing director, Rob Key (left), gave a presentation to the ICC arguing against the severity of punishments for slow play in cricket. Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAUnder the existing scoring system all WTC matches are worth the same – 12 for a win, six for a tie and four for a draw – which has led to complaints that the big three are disadvantaged as they play more games against each other. South Africa’s achievement in reaching this year’s final led to some resentment as they did so without playing England or Australia. Series wins against West Indies, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, a draw against India and defeat in India yielded enough points for the Proteas to reach the final for the first time.Another aspect of the WTC under review is the subject of over-rate penalties, with Rob Key, the director of England cricket, having recently given a presentation to the ICC men’s cricket committee arguing against the severity of the system. While six of the nine teams in the current edition have been hit with penalties for slow play, England are the worst offenders. They lost 22 points to finish sixth with a points percentage of 41.5. However, their win percentage of 51.5 during this period is third-best behind the finalists, South Africa and Australia.The issue came to a head in New Zealand last December when Ben Stokes, the England captain, revealed he had spent the previous 18 months refusing to sign ICC paperwork at the end of Test matches as a protest against its lack of engagement on the subject.England have ultimately been bang to rights under a system that demands teams maintain an average of 15 overs per hour in the field. After allowances for stoppages such as reviews, the only way teams can escape a sanction is to have bowled their opponents out in less than 80 overs – a tweak prompted by lobbying from Australia two years ago.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionBut dissatisfaction at the penalties – which, as well as points deductions, lead to match fees being docked – is not exclusive to England and comes at a time when draws are on the way out. Only three Test matches out of 50 last year failed to produce a winner, a figure that has been trending downwards since a record 21 draws from 44 Tests in 1997.At the same time, Test matches have never been slower in terms of over rates, with 1975 the last year teams averaged 15 overs per hour overall. The pace of play is marginally quicker in countries where the spinners dominate, albeit not to the extent that Stokes argued when expressing his frustration.While draws are becoming rarer, there are tactical advantages to a slow over rate for sides in seam-heavy conditions, allowing the fast bowlers to rest for longer between spells and reducing the need for overs to be supplemented by all-rounders. Stokes is also an example of a captain who likes to tweak his fields repeatedly.Through Key, England have been able to state their case for a revision of the penalties, including spectator surveys that show the problem of slow play rarely crops up in feedback.One change under consideration – potentially due to be trialled in the next WTC cycle – is the introduction of a stop-clock. In place for ODIs since last year, it gives a fielding team 60 seconds between overs to get into position. After two warnings, a team is given a five-run penalty per infringement.",
