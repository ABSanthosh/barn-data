  "text": "(18.2/20 ov, T:158) 160/3Gloucs won by 7 wickets (with 10 balls remaining)ReportAjeet Singh Dale's 3 for 24 sets up defending champions' seven-wicket victoryJack Taylor slices one away through backward point  •  Dan Istitene/Getty ImagesGloucestershire 160 for 3 (Taylor 54*, Price 41*) beat Kent Spitfires 157 for 9 (Finch 42, Billings 38, Singh Dale 3-24) by seven wicketsVitality Blast champions Gloucestershire have finally got their first win of the season, at the sixth attempt, after beating the Kent Spitfires by seven wickets at Canterbury with 10 balls to spare. Jack Taylor top-scored with 54 not out and Ollie Price cashed in with an unbeaten 41 after being bowled off a no ball and dropped.Earlier Kent posted a modest looking 157 for 9. Ajeet Singh Dale took 3 for 24, while David Payne, took 1 for 18 and went for just 4.5 an over. Harry Finch was the Spitfires' top scorer with 42.The hosts chose to bat first but Sunday's centurion, Daniel Bell-Drummond, went for just 3, pulling Singh Dale to Ollie Price at midwicket.Tawanda Muyeye had made 33 from 22 when Singh Dale had him caught on the boundary by D'Arcy Short, leaving Finch and Sam Billings to bat relatively cautiously, putting on 74 for the third wicket but taking 9.4 overs to do it.Billings was just starting to get going, hitting successive reverse-swept fours, when he was bowled by Josh Shaw for 38.Finch was on 40 when he ramped Singh Dale and although Jack Taylor couldn't take a diving catch, he did save three runs and having taken the strike Joey Evison hit Singh Dale's next delivery straight to Graeme van Buuren.Payne's cutters were almost unplayable and two outstanding catches gave Matt Taylor two wickets in as many balls. Finch finally went when Miles Hammond parried the ball inside the rope, hopped over it to keep his balance and then hopped back to complete the catch. Tom Rogers then went for a golden duck as Ben Charlesworth somehow clung on one-handed while diving forwards.When Grant Stewart drove Josh Shaw straight to Jack Taylor for 1 Gloucestershire were through to the bowlers.Jack Leaning restored some impetus with successive fours, but he was bowled by Payne for 18 in the 20th. Fred Klaassen was run out off the next ball chasing a single and at halfway Gloucestershire looked favourites.Short pulled Wes Agar for six in the fourth over but with the score 29 without loss the players had to go off because sunlight was dazzling the batters at The Nackington Road End.Play resumed after an 11-minute delay which seemed to unsettle the visitors as they lost three wickets in ten balls. Rogers made the breakthrough when Short tried to hook him and Billings caught him for 33 after the ball hung in the air for several seconds.Cameron Bancroft flashed at Evison and was caught by a flying Billings for three and Parkinson removed Hammond for 25 in the next over, caught by Rogers at cow corner.The visitors however, were given a huge break when Agar bowled Ollie Price in the 10th, only for it be ruled a no-ball. Price got a second life in the next over when Parkinson dropped an easy caught-and-bowled chance.The air went out of the Spitfire Ground and what might have been a contest turned into a non-event as any scoreboard pressure evaporated, Taylor glancing Agar for four to secure the win.Instant answers to T20 questionsVitality Blast Men",
