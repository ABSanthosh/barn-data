Many experts and ex-cricketers have raised their voices in favour of India's superstars playing more domestic cricket for their state teams and giving back to their states and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has even come up with a new 10-point player policy, which makes domestic cricket compulsory. BCCI on Thursday released new policies for Team India, making it \"mandatory\" to participate in domestic matches to remain \"eligible\" for selection in the national team and for the central contracts.In the policy, BCCI stated that taking part in domestic cricket will remain connected to the cricket ecosystem. The statement added that any exceptions to taking part in domestic cricket will be considered only under extraordinary circumstances.\"Participation in Domestic Matches is mandatory for players to remain eligible for selection in the national team and for central contracts, as per BCCI guidelines. This policy ensures that players remain connected to the domestic cricket ecosystem, fostering talent development, maintaining match fitness, and strengthening the overall domestic structure. It also inspires emerging players by providing them opportunities to compete alongside top cricketers, ensuring continuity in talent progression. Any exceptions to this mandate will be considered only under extraordinary circumstances and will require formal notification and approval from the Chairman of the Selection Committee, ensuring fairness and transparency in the process,\" BCCI said in a statement.In recent days, young stars Rishabh Pant, Shubman Gill and even Yashasvi Jaiswal are among the ones who have reportedly confirmed their participation in upcoming Ranji Trophy matches, with the status of star seniors Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli still unknown.Let us look at last Ranji appearances for all Indian Test stars:Rohit Sharma: His last Ranji appearance for Mumbai came in November 2015 during which he scored 113 in 140 balls against Uttar Pradesh.
