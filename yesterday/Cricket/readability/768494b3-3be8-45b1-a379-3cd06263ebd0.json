  "text": "England have recalled Rehan Ahmed as one of three frontline spinners for the series decider against Pakistan in Rawalpindi.Leg-spinner Ahmed, 20, comes into the side alongside Gus Atkinson, replacing Matthew Potts and Brydon Carse from the side beaten in the second Test.He will line up alongside Shoaib Bashir and Jack Leach in a three-pronged spin attack, leaving Atkinson and captain Ben Stokes to shoulder the pace bowling.England twice played three frontline spinners on their tour of India earlier this year and the move comes amid speculation over the surface for Thursday's third Test.\"We know it's probably not going to swing and seam and do all sorts in the first session, so we look at the pitch and work out what the best team is going to be,\" England batter Harry Brook told BBC Sport.Ahmed made his international debut in Pakistan two years ago, at 18 becoming the youngest man to play Test cricket for England.His 5-48 in the third Test in Karachi made him the third-youngest man to take a five-wicket haul on a Test debut. Ahmed has since won a total of four caps, the last of which came against India in Rajkot in February.\"He's an outstanding cricketer,\" added Brook. \"It's not just his bowling, but his batting and fielding. He's a young lad so he has a lot of time to come.\"He got five-for in the last Test here, so hopefully he can do that again.\"Pakistan levelled the series 1-1 on a reused pitch in Multan, with spinners Noman Ali and Sajid Khan sharing all 20 wickets.As England trained in Rawalpindi for the first time on this tour on Tuesday, the large fans employed in Multan were again at either end of the pitch but not turned on.On Sunday, pictures emerged on social media of patio heaters and windbreaks being placed around the strip in an attempt to dry it. They were removed by Monday, leaving just the industrial-sized fans.\"It's interesting and it’s unique,\" said Brook. \"I think everyone is just guessing. We'll see in a couple of days.\"I'd say it will be a good pitch for the first day, two days maybe, then it will start spinning.\"With left-armer Noman taking 11 wickets and off-spinner Sajid nine in the second Test, they became the first pair of bowlers to share all 20 wickets in a Test since 1972.In the record-breaking win in the first Test Brook made England’s first triple-century in 34 years, then was out for nine and 16 in the second Test. Sajid revealed his plan for bowling at Brook, who was twice out trying to score off the back foot.\"We'll still look to score against them and put them under the pump,\" said 25-year-old Brook. \"I'll go about it a little bit differently, so we'll see how we get on.\"I do like to play spin off the back foot. It gives you a lot more time to play the spinning ball; it gives you different areas to play in. I'm not going to say I’m not going to do that. I'll look to play off the back foot and look to put him under pressure.\"England are looking for a second successive series win in Pakistan, after a 3-0 victory here two years ago.Their triumph on this ground in the first Test of that series, in fading light in the final session of the fifth day, is one of their greatest overseas wins.\"It's very exciting,\" said Brook, who scored his maiden Test century in Rawalpindi. \"We want to play in the big matches. It's like a final.\"It was a very special moment in my career and for the team. Winning in the last few moments of the game was really good.\"There's a really good photo of the final wicket. The memory will live with me forever. Hopefully we can perform well and get another win.\"",
