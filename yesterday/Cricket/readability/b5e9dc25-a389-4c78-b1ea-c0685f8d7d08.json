It is understood Ben Stokes' side are keen for him to return.Anderson said it is not yet clear what resuming his playing career will mean for his role with England this summer but added he will prioritise appearing for Lancashire if selected.\"I don't think it would be fair on Lancashire if I just dipped in and out,\" he said.\"It's only fair that I give it a good crack and that'll take precedence over anything else during the summer.\"Anderson retired from internationals after England opted to look to the future with their bowling attack, finishing with 704 Test wickets - the most by a pace bowler and third most overall.He has taken 1,126 wickets in 298 first-class matches, with 376 of those wickets coming in 95 matches for Lancashire since his debut in 2002.\"The one thing I've known for many months is that I wanted to play cricket,\" said Anderson, who turns 43 in July.\"It was just trying to find what sort of cricket I wanted to play and after a few chats with Lancashire and their plans for the year it just felt like a nice thing to do.\"Anderson could play his first T20 match in nearly 11 years when Lancashire's Blast campaign begins on 29 May.He has not played any white-ball cricket since 2019 but has recently tried to enter franchise cricket, going unsold in the Indian Premier League auction in November.Anderson is currently in Abu Dhabi helping England fast bowlers Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Brydon Carse and Mark Wood prepare for the upcoming white-ball tour of India.He said Archer has been \"absolutely rapid\" in the nets and \"looks in a great place\", while Wood has returned to bowling after a right elbow injury ruled him out of the last few months of 2024.Anderson added both are \"absolutely desperate\" to be part of England's attempt to regain the Ashes in Australia at the end of this year.Archer, 29, has not played a Test since 2021 because of a string of injuries, though has consistently been able to play white-ball internationals since May.His Indian Premier League deal with Rajasthan Royals could mean he does not play in the County Championship for Sussex until June, though if that goes well he could still feature at some stage of England's five-Test home series against India.\"They're both excited at the fact they are fit and they want to stay fit,\" said Anderson.\"If they could play a part against India, that'd be great, then to have them in Australia would be a massive bonus for England.\"",
