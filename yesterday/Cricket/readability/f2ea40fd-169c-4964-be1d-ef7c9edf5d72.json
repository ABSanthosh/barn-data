The three ODIs were played across seven days in three different cities.Having made his initial comments during the TV commentary, Pietersen repeated his criticism on Thursday, saying \"injuries are not stopping batters from batting against new bowlers and learning the art of spin\".\"We've done lots of training,\" McCullum said. \"We have had injuries in the camp so we've backed guys off a little bit to make sure we had a fit team.\"We have three training sessions in Pakistan [before the Champions Trophy starts].\"Hopefully in Pakistan we will have a fully fit squad to pick from and we look forward to a fresh challenge. It's been a tough lesson but hopefully it's been great preparation for the tournament.\"England's latest fitness concern is over opener Ben Duckett, who injured his left groin in the third ODI. He will have a scan in the coming days before the Champions Trophy opener against Australia on 22 February in Lahore.\"He's had quite a lot of cricket over the last little while,\" said McCullum. \"We will make that call, work out if he's going to be at risk, if he's in or out.\"England have already lost all-rounder Jacob Bethell to a hamstring injury - he has been replaced by batter Tom Banton - while wicketkeeper Jamie Smith has not played since the third T20 on 28 January because of a calf injury.McCullum said Smith will be fit to face Australia and played down concerns over Brydon Carse's toe issue, a cut to Jofra Archer's hand and a hamstring niggle affecting Jamie Overton.\"Jamie [Smith] would have been a risk [on Wednesday] but he will be available for the first game,\" McCullum said. \"With Brydon, hopefully his toe has healed by then and he is available for the first game.\"Jamie Overton feels OK. He felt a little bit of tightness after the last game but he should be fine for the first one. Jofra should be available. That's good news.\"",
