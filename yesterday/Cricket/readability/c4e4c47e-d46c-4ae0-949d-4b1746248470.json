  "text": "Ruthless England seal series clean sweep v WindiesMedia caption, England beat West Indies to complete ODI series clean sweep - highlightsThird women's ODI, TauntonWest Indies 106-8 (21 overs): Joseph 34 (44); Glenn 3-21England 109-1 (10.5 overs): Sciver-Brunt 57* (33)England won by nine wickets (DLS method); win series 3-0 Scorecard England sealed a comprehensive one-day international series clean sweep over West Indies with a nine-wicket thrashing in a rain-affected encounter at Taunton.Set a target of just 106 in a match reduced to 21 overs per side, England cruised to victory in 10.5 overs with captain Nat Sciver-Brunt finishing unbeaten on 57 from 33 balls.Sophia Dunkley made 26 at the top of the order as England rejigged their batting line-up, while Alice Capsey finished unbeaten on 20 in another one-sided affair.West Indies, who were again without star all-rounder Hayley Matthews because of a shoulder injury, had slipped to 4-3 inside the first four overs after England chose to bowl first under gloomy skies. Stand-in captain Shemaine Campbelle and opener Qiana Joseph gradually rebuilt with a partnership of 39 before heavy rain led to a five-hour delay after 12.3 overs had been bowled. Campbelle fell to Charlie Dean from the first ball after the resumption as the tourists slumped further to 58-6, but they smacked 31 from the last two overs to post 106-8. Leg-spinner Sarah Glenn was the pick of England's bowlers with 3-21, while seamer Em Arlott took 2-15.England also won the preceding T20 series 3-0, and their summer continues with three T20s and three ODIs against India, starting at Trent Bridge on 28 June.Poor West Indies batters wilt againMedia caption, England take three wickets inside opening four oversWithout Matthews, West Indies' batting hopes were already bleak and in bowler-friendly conditions, England dominated as expected.With plenty of movement on offer from the surface, Kate Cross had Realeanna Grimmond caught behind in the first over as the 20-year-old was unable to back up her promising half-century on debut at Leicester on Thursday.Arlott bowled Zaida James with a full delivery in the second over, and pinned veteran batter Stafanie Taylor lbw for one in the fourth.Despite the rain looming, Campbelle and Joseph had to rebuild the innings at a 50-over tempo which left them needing to attack from the outset once play resumed.Instead, the wickets tumbled. Campbelle was stumped off Dean for 18, Shabika Gajnabi was bowled by Glenn for one and Jannillea Glasgow was caught at mid-on by Alice Davidson-Richards off Lauren Filer.Joseph's 34 held the innings together but Aaliyah Alleyne whacked five consecutive fours from the penultimate over bowled by Filer to provide a late flurry, and Jahzara Claxton added 11 from four balls including an enormous six off Glenn to eventually push them past 100.Sciver-Brunt shines as England improviseMedia caption, Watch the best shots from Sciver-Brunt's half-centuryAfter two opening stands of more than 200 between Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont to start the series, England understandably wanted their other batters to spend some time in the middle, with the three upcoming ODIs against India being their last in the format before the World Cup, which starts in late September in India. Dunkley dominated the opening stand of 40 in five overs with her captain, scoring 26 from 21 balls before she was pinned lbw by spinner Karishma Ramharack.From there, Sciver-Brunt wanted the game done in a hurry as she took down the bowlers, clubbing the spinners efficiently down the ground as she struck nine fours in her destructive knock. Capsey made a quickfire 20 from 11 balls in their 69-run stand, as she attempted to strengthen her case for the ODI side in the absence of injured former captain Heather Knight.It would have been preferable for England's batters to have either a more challenging total to chase or more overs to bat, but the upcoming India series is likely to provide a far greater test of their abilities and a chance for coach Charlotte Edwards to see how her side steps up under pressure. There was little West Indies could do with so few runs to defend, and would have been grateful for their miserable tour to come to an end more than 10 overs early. 'People have created headaches' - what they saidMedia caption, 'Where has this been all day?' - Alleyne hits five consecutive fours off penultimate overEngland captain Nat Sciver-Brunt: \"A great way to finish the series, finish the way we wanted to. A happy group.\"Everyone who's been given the opportunity has put their hands up, it makes for some headaches for sure.\"West Indies captain Shemaine Campbelle: \"There are a lot of learnings that can come out of this series. The younger players have stepped up and they have made good use of it. There is a lot of improvement to come. It's a work in progress and they will learn quickly from this.\"Player of the series Amy Jones: \"It has exceeded my expectation. A lot of fun batting at the top and it was good to get the last win.\"I knew opening was an option, it was good to get games with the Blaze and batting with Tammy and happy to get a go at the top.\"India have got some of the best bowlers in the world and I'd love to be up there.\"More on this story",
