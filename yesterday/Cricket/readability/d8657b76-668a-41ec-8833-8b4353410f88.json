Here are the latest updates about his injury and probable comeback date. Since November last year, Shami has been out of action owing to an ankle injury. Consequently, the fast bowler underwent surgery in February and has been on the road to recovery since then. As part of his rehabilitation, he has started bowling in the nets at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru. Further delay in Shami's return There's more concern over Shami's comeback, after not being named in Bengal's Ranji squad to face Karnataka on November 6. Despite suggesting he's a \"100 per cent\" in nets, Shami still seems to be on the road to recovery. Shami ruled out of BGT The fast bowler couldn't recover in time, and was ruled out of the Australia tour, not being named in the touring group. Shami quashes reports of him missing Australia tour On October 2, Shami took to social media to refute any reports of him missing the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The quick dismissed them as \"baseless rumours\", saying that neither he nor the BCCI had mentioned anything about him being out of the tour. Report: Shami in doubt for Australia tour due to 'swollen knee' According to a Times of India report, Shami’s comeback plans have hit a major roadblock after developing a \"swollen knee\" while rehabilitating at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) Bengaluru. The pacer could take another six to eight weeks to recover, raising doubts over his participation in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, starting November 22. \"Shami had resumed bowling and he was looking on track to make a comeback to competitive cricket soon. But this knee injury has flared up recently. BCCI's medical team is assessing the injury but it may require quite a bit of time,\" a BCCI source was quoted as saying by Times of India. The source added: \"It's a jolt for the NCA medical team. They have been working on him for over a year. They have one of the best workload management systems in place. The medical team is trying its best to put him back in the park soon.\" Shami: Don’t want to rush and risk getting injured again After not being a part of India’s squad against Bangladesh, in the latest update, Shami confirmed that he doesn’t want to rush his comeback and clarified he is not thinking about the upcoming New Zealand series at home or the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. If required, he will play domestic cricket to check his fitness before returning to internationals. \"I am working hard to make a comeback soon because I know I have been out of action for quite some time. I want to ensure there is no discomfort when I return. I have to work on my fitness so there is no discomfort,\" Shami revealed during the CAB annual awards ceremony. Shami added: \"The stronger I return, the better it is for me. I don't want to rush and risk getting injured again, be it against Bangladesh, New Zealand, or the Australia series. I've already started bowling, but I won't take any chances until I am 100 per cent fit. If I need to play domestic cricket to test my fitness, I will. What matters most is that I am fully ready for whatever comes next, regardless of the opposition or format.\" India hopeful Shami will return for Bangladesh series – reports According to a report on August 9 from ESPNCricinfo, Shami could make a return to action during India's home Test series against Bangladesh in September. The report also states that the selectors are debating whether he should take part in at least one Duleep Trophy match ahead of the series. If he does not make it in time for the Bangladesh series, Shami could return during the next home series against New Zealand. However, if he misses that deadline, his best shot at returning will be to play the Ranji Trophy and the India 'A' games ahead of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Shami to return via domestic route Shami was expected to return in India’s Test series against Bangladesh in September. However, that looks unlikely for now. The pacer confirmed that he will play domestic cricket for Bengal “to come fully prepared\" for his international comeback. Given India are touring Australia in November for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, they would expect their ace pacer to bowl full-tilt. That’s why India might not risk him against Bangladesh. \"It's difficult to say when I will be back. I am trying hard, but hopefully you will get to see me in Bengal colours before I don the India jersey again. I will come to play two-three matches for Bengal and will come fully prepared for it,\" Shami was quoted as saying by Times of India. \"We never thought the injury would be this serious\" He added: \"We never thought the injury would be this serious. The plan was to address it after the T20 World Cup since we had the IPL and the ICC T20 mega event coming almost back-to-back after last year's World Cup. But it turned worse during the ODI World Cup itself and I also did not find it right to risk playing on with it. Even the doctors could not fathom that the injury will take such a serious turn and will take so much time to heal.\" Shami was forced out of the 2024 IPL as well as India’s title-winning run in the T20 World Cup thereafter, owing to the prolonged injury hiatus.
