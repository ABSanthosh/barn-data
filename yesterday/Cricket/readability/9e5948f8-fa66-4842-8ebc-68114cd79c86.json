  "text": "Trevor Bayliss has left his role as London Spirit coach after three seasons in charge of The Hundred franchise.The former England coach succeeded the late Shane Warne in 2022 and led Spirit to the Eliminator in his first season.But the last two seasons have been more difficult, with the team finishing second-bottom and bottom, winning just three out of 16 games across both years.The Australian's contract expired at the end of the 2024 season.\"We'd all like to thank Trevor for his considerable efforts across the last three seasons,\" said London Spirit general manager Fraser Stewart.\"He initially joined us in difficult circumstances and led the side to a strong finish in 2022, but the team hasn't been able to replicate that success since.\"As a group we're desperate to see London Spirit competing at the right end of the table and we think a new approach may be of benefit to our chances. Trevor leaves Lord's with our best wishes and our gratitude.\"Bayliss was England coach from 2015 to 2019, leading the side to a famous victory over New Zealand at Lord's to win the Cricket World Cup in 2019.He had previously guided Sri Lanka to the 2011 final, where they were beaten by co-hosts India.He has also had coaching spells with Australian Big Bash side Sydney Sixers, plus Kolkata Knight Riders, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Punjab Kings of the Indian Premier League.Spirit also confirmed that Ashley Noffke will remain head coach of the women's side, whom he led to their first Hundred title in 2024.",
