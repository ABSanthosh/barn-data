  "text": "Jofra Archer is being primed to make a comeback in the second Test against India at Edgbaston – his first appearance in whites for four years – with England’s stable of fast bowlers under strain before the start of this summer’s marquee series.Naming a 14-man squad for the first Test at Headingley that starts on 20 June, Luke Wright, who is part of the selection panel, confirmed Gus Atkinson is ruled out with a hamstring injury. In come Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse and Jamie Overton, likewise Jacob Bethell to offer competition among the batting spots.But perhaps more eye-catching was the news that Archer is back playing second XI cricket for Sussex with a view to turning out at Durham in the round of County Championship fixtures that begins on 22 June. Get through that game and, like Atkinson, the second Test in Birmingham could be a realistic target for a return.“We know with Jof he’s such a talent it doesn’t take him too long to get up to speed,” said Wright, outlining this comeback schedule. “We can assess it from there, how he’s bowled, how he’s feeling. If all goes well and Jofra gets through that Durham game, then he’s available, potentially for selection for that second Test.”As ever with Archer, there is an element of fingers being crossed. The four-year absence from red-ball cricket was triggered by a string of stress injuries to his lower back and right elbow, while his current schedule has already featured one setback after he injured his thumb in the Indian Premier League.But equally, the attributes he possesses are tantalising, while England will welcome any reinforcements for a seam attack that lacks experience and has lost the unsettling pace of Mark Wood to a knee injury. The return of Carse – who revealed last week that he had contemplated “amputation” of his second toe to offer respite from his injury problems – at least offers some snarl, after he picked up 27 wickets in five Tests last winter. Wright, meanwhile, offered a glimmer of hope that Wood could be back for the end of the series, in which England will compete for the new Tendulkar-Anderson trophy.Of the five frontline quicks named for the first Test, only Woakes is in double figures caps-wise, however. And while Wright spelled out that Woakes sits ahead of the retained Sam Cook in the pecking order – Matthew Potts was overlooked altogether – a season delayed by ankle bone stress means the 36-year-old still needs to demonstrate his fitness by playing for the Lions against India A this week.England Lions coach Andrew Flintoff talks with Chris Woakes during a net session at Northampton on Wednesday. Photograph: Shaun Botterill/ECB/Getty ImagesStarting in Northampton on Friday, that match also has Josh Tongue down to play. And going by Wright’s verdict on Overton – back-up for the faster bowlers but also offering some heft with the bat – the intended three to take on India are Woakes, Tongue and Carse, with Shoaib Bashir the sole frontline spinner in the squad.The batting appears more settled and, even considering his lack of a senior hundred to date, has something of an oversupply with Bethell returning to the mix. The question now is whether the 21-year-old slots straight into the XI for the series opener, something Ben Stokes appeared to hint at before the one-off Test against Zimbabwe only to later claim his words had been deliberately misinterpreted.Stokes was chiefly looking after Ollie Pope here, with his vice-captain having made 171 in the match after returning to the No 3 spot that Bethell occupied in New Zealand. Wright notably chose not to commit either way, instead stressing that the final team will be selected when the squad meet in Leeds and conditions are assessed.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“He’s very close to it,” replied Wright, when asked if Bethell had been picked to play. “It’s a great option to have, isn’t it? What a talent we all see in him.

There are always places up for grabs, that’s international cricket. That’s the way it always should be. You want a strong squad. They’re all big lads, they know what it’s all about.“The one thing Baz and Stokes have been excellent with is their man management. I’m sure the players will be very aware of what’s going on.”Meanwhile England have confirmed that Phil Salt will miss the T20 series against West Indies that starts in Durham on Friday due to paternity leave. Jamie Smith, the Test wicketkeeper who now opens for the one-day team, is his replacement.",
