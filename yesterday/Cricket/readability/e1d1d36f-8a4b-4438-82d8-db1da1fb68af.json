  "text": "NewsFast bowler will play for second XI in New Malden after Surrey opted not to include him for Yorkshire clashGus Atkinson has not played competitive cricket since May  •  Joe Allison/Getty ImagesGus Atkinson has found himself in the middle of a country versus county wrangle, the upshot of which will involve him playing for Surrey's second XI rather than their first team, after he was omitted from England's side to face India in the fourth Test at Emirates Old Trafford.Atkinson has not played competitive cricket since May, when he injured his hamstring during England's one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge. Although he has since been deemed fit enough to return to the squad from the third Test onwards, even playing for his club side Spencer CC during the Saturday of the Lord's Test, he has yet to feature.On Monday afternoon, the 27-year-old was put through his paces by men's physical preparation coach Peter Sim and bowling consultant Tim Southee. However, with England 2-1 up in the series, the management have decided not to pick Atkinson for the Manchester Test, which begins on Wednesday.The soft outfield, coupled with the need to supplement the likes of Jofra Archer, Brydon Carse and skipper Ben Stokes with a team-mate who can guarantee a certain number of overs, has meant that Atkinson will not be risked. Chris Woakes, who pulled up well a week on from the final day at Lord's, has kept his place despite a current series haul of seven wickets at 56.42.Gus Atkinson added to squad as England ponder changes for Lord'sBrydon Carse: Attritional Lord's win proves this England team can adaptOval Test to feature 'Day for Thorpey' in commemoration of Graham ThorpeBumrah to play fourth Test; Pant on track to keep as wellIn the circumstances, England were keen for Atkinson to head north to Scarborough for Surrey's County Championship match against Yorkshire. However, the county have opted not to include Atkinson into their XI. Instead, he will return to London to play for Surrey's second XI in a four-day match against Somerset at the club's LSE Ground in New Malden.Surrey's reasons for not selecting Atkinson are the same as England's, given he has not played a red-ball match in two months, and they may need to lean heavily on their bowlers given the Kookaburra ball will be in use for this round. They also have the depth not to need to risk Atkinson for this crucial fixture, with the defending champions currently leading Division One by just a point from Nottinghamshire.Jamie Overton, part of the squad for the first three Tests, will play his first Championship match since May. He will line up alongside stalwarts Jordan Clark and Dan Worrall, as well as Matthew Fisher, who has excelled with the Kookaburra, taking 10 wickets in the last two fixtures.Atkinson is currently on a two-year central contract, which means the ECB rather than Surrey pay his wages. Though England would obviously prefer Atkinson to play for the first XI, it is accepted that they cannot force counties' hands when it comes to selection.Another of England's omitted seamers, Josh Tongue - who played in the first two Tests at Headingley and Edgbaston - will feature for Nottinghamshire on days three and four of their Championship clash against Hampshire at the Utilita Bowl.Vithushan Ehantharajah is an associate editor at ESPNcricinfo",
