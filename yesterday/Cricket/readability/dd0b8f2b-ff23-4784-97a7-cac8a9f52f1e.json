India then responded with 462 to set a victory target of 107 and the 24-year-old was 39 not out when Will Young hit the winning runs, a second crucial contribution securing him the player of the match award.“Our first two innings were outstanding, the way we were able to set the match up with the ball and apply pressure for long periods of time,” Latham told reporters. “With bat we managed to form a couple of key partnerships, which in the context of the match were really important. Rachin was a huge part in that. The way he played … a 137-run stand with a No 9 batsman [Tim Southee] is awesome.“Even this morning, the way he came out with the game in the balance … he calmed the dressing room with his composure. For a young guy in his ninth or 10th Test, to play in that fashion is exciting.”It is unclear whether Williamson, New Zealand’s leading Test run-scorer, will recover from a groin injury in time to take part in the three-match series.“Anyone of Kane’s calibre, if he’s right and able to come back into the side, would be great,” Latham said. “Selection headaches are always great things to have and fingers crossed he’ll be all right and can get over here as soon as possible.”India, meanwhile, had their own heroes despite their defeat, Sarfaraz Khanmaking 150 and Rishabh Pant 99.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“Some of the shots, some of these guys played in the middle, knowing we’re 350 behind shows what they want to go out and do.

When we are behind, we’re going to try and see how we can put the pressure on the opposition. Some of the Tests we played recently shows what I’m talking about and that’s how it’s going to be.”",
