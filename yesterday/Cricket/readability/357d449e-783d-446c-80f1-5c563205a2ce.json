He wants to spend some more time with his family and the new-born and the Indian cricket board completely respects his decision,\" an official close to developments told Times of India (TOI). Rohit and his wife Ritika welcomed a baby boy on Friday night. The India captain didn't travel with the team to Perth for the series opener to stay with his family and will link up with the squad for the second match, starting November 30, claimed the TOI report. In an Instagram post on Saturday, the couple officially announced the birth of their second child. Earlier Rohit hinted at missing the series opener due to personal reasons after India’s 0-3 series whitewash at home against New Zealand. His possible departure means either KL Rahul or Abhimanyu Easwaran will open the innings in the first Test, something head coach Gautam Gambhir revealed in a press conference. However, there’s a question mark on Rahul’s fitness after he was hit on his elbow during India’s intrasquad simulation match at Perth. Earlier Sarfaraz Khan was also spotted leaving the field due to a similar blow. But Wisden.com has learnt that there are \"no issues\" with Sarfaraz after the hit. Uncapped Easwaran, Rohit’s other backup for the opener’s role, didn’t have an impressive outing either. After a middling performance during India A’s unofficial Tests against Australia A earlier, Easwaran flopped in the intrasquad match, too. Adding to India’s headache, Shubman Gill could be doubtful for the first match after reportedly injuring his finger while taking a slip catch during their match simulation practice.
