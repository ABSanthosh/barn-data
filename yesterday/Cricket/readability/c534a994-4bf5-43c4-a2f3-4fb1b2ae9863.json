  "text": "NZ hopeful bowler Henry will be fit for India finalMedia caption, Klaasen dismissed for three thanks to Henry's sprinting diveNew Zealand are hopeful pace bowler Matt Henry will be fit to face India in the Champions Trophy final in Dubai on Sunday.Henry, 33, the tournament's leading wicket-taker, jarred his right shoulder while taking a catch in the Black Caps' semi-final win against South Africa.New Zealand are awaiting results of scans and coach Gary Stead said they will give Henry \"every chance\".\"It is still a little bit of an unknown,\" Stead said.\"He is obviously pretty sore. [We are] hopeful he will be OK.\"Henry has taken 10 wickets in New Zealand's four matches at the Champions Trophy - two more than the next most successful bowler, Mohammed Shami, who has taken eight for India.He was injured taking the catch to dismiss Heinrich Klaasen in the 29th over but after spending time off the field returned to bowl two further overs.Pace bowler Jacob Duffy or fast-bowling all-rounder Nathan Smith would be the most likely replacements for Henry if he is not passed fit.\"It was pretty uncomfortable,\" Stead said. \"The positive thing for us is he got back out there to bowl. \"We are going to give him every chance to be playing in this match.\"New Zealand arrived back in Dubai on Thursday after playing their semi-final in Lahore a day earlier. That came after they were beaten by 44 runs by India in Dubai in the final match of Group A on Sunday.India's progression means the final will also be played in Dubai, because India have refused to travel to hosts Pakistan.The advantages India have gained from playing all of their matches in Dubai, rather than travelling to the three Pakistan venues, has been a constant topic of debate throughout the tournament but Stead played down the issue.\"It is a little bit out of our control,\" he said. \"They are not decisions that come across my desk anyway.\"",
