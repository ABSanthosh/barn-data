While England unsuccessfully reviewed in the hope of an lbw, Pant was still forced to leave the field on the back of a golf cart.“He was in a lot of pain,” said Sai Sudharsan, who was at the other end and top-scored for India with 61, his maiden Test half-century, as they closed on 264 for four after Ben Stokes won the toss. “They’ve gone for scans. We’ll get to know overnight, probably get the information tomorrow.”“I hope he’s all right,” England’s Liam Dawson said. “He’s obviously a very good player. I probably can’t see him taking much more part in this game.” Pant arrived in Manchester with his fitness under focus after a finger injury, sustained while keeping on the opening day at Lord’s, hampered him for the remainder of that Test. Another injury is a significant blow to the visitors, with Pant the second-highest run-scorer in the series.Dawson managed to escape any serious punishment off Pant as he enjoyed a solid return to Test cricket, eight years on from his last appearance in the format. The left-arm spinner took just seven balls to find the outside edge of Yashasvi Jaiswal for 58, Harry Brook gobbling up at slip. The 35-year-old finished with tidy figures of one for 45 off 15 overs.“I was just trying to bowl my best ball,” Dawson said. “Just land it in the area as many times as you can. Thankfully, it got a little bit of drift and he nicked it.“I’ve said to a few people that at the age that I’m at, I probably thought Test cricket was gone. To be back involved is really cool and I’ve got to try and enjoy each day that I get. It’s just one wicket. I’ve done nothing special there. It’s one wicket but it’s another big day tomorrow.”On how he has changed as a bowler since his first stint in the Test side, Dawson said: “I’m probably a little more consistent, understand pitches a little better. The older you get, you learn how to manage game scenarios.”Reminded that he took 10 wickets and hit a century at Old Trafford in an innings victory for Hampshire last year, Dawson replied: “Do you know what? I completely forgot about that.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionSudharsan enjoyed his comeback too, even if his absence was brief. After making his debut at three in the first Test at Headingley – returning a duck and second-innings 30 – the 23-year-old was left out of the following two matches as India opted for an extra all-rounder. However, the southpaw returned to first drop in place of Karun Nair and hung on for 151 deliveries. Given the short-ball treatment, he eventually perished to Stokes, a miscued pull finding Brydon Carse at long leg. The challenge was still welcomed.“It was actually a really enjoyable experience, to be honest,” said Sudharsan. “Because one of the best bowlers in the country is steaming in and trying to hit you hard. And you being there and giving your best for the team. That’s one of the best feelings you can have.“Playing against England on their home soil, you have to be ready for that aggressive nature. I enjoyed it.”",
