  "text": "Women's T20 World Cup, DubaiNew Zealand 110-6 (20 overs): Bates 28 (29); Nashra 3-18Pakistan 56 (11.4 overs): Sana 21 (23); Kerr 3-14New Zealand won by 54 runsScorecard. Table.New Zealand booked their place in the semi-finals of the Women's T20 World Cup with a comprehensive 54-run win over Pakistan in Dubai.Pakistan needed to chase their target of 111 within 10.4 overs to keep themselves in knockout contention via net run-rate, but paid the price for their aggressive intent by slumping to 56 all out in 11.4 overs.Despite collapsing to 28-5 after the six-over powerplay, the Pakistan batters kept attacking to keep their hopes alive rather than simply settle for a comfortable chase of less than a run-a-ball. New Zealand's batters had earlier struggled against Pakistan's spin attack, who expertly stifled the run-rate in the middle overs but were let down in the field with eight catches put down. Suzie Bates was dropped twice in her 28, the innings' top score, and then crucially three were put down in the final over which allowed Maddy Green and Izzy Gaze to scamper nine extra runs. But while their 110-6 felt below-par, New Zealand were rewarded for a disciplined all-round bowling effort with some assistance from Pakistan's chaotic but understandable approach. Leg-spinner Melie Kerr starred with 3-14 while fellow spinner Eden Carson took 2-7.It is New Zealand's first semi-final in either white-ball format since 2016, and they join six-time winners Australia from Group A with India eliminated. They will face the winner of Group B which will be either South Africa, England or West Indies, with the latter two teams playing on Tuesday.Few would have had New Zealand as semi-final contenders before the tournament began as they came in with 10 straight T20 defeats, but started in sensational style by thumping potential winners India in their opener.And despite a heavy defeat by relentless Australia, they have continued to dominate against Sri Lanka and Pakistan to finish the group stage with plenty of momentum. The pre-match equation was simple, with a win of any margin enough, but there appeared to be some early nerves in the batting line-up given the pressure of the situation. Pakistan will rue the dropped catches - it was a pitiful display which saw bonus chances given to Bates, Kerr, Sophie Devine and Brooke Halliday. None of them capitalised enough to really rub salt into the wound, but just enough to ensure that Pakistan had to go hard early in their chase and maintain it, which proved way beyond their capabilities. Opener Muneeba Ali struck two early boundaries in her 15 before she was bowled by Lea Tahuhu, who also brilliantly ran out number three Iram Javed from short third.The powerful Aliya Riaz was promoted to open but the experiment did not pay off as she fell for a duck, as did Sidra Ameen, while captain Fatima Sana's 21 from 23 balls was the only contribution of note as the middle to lower order was skittled by the wily spin of Kerr and Carson. And while there were wild screams of delight and hugs of joy between the New Zealand players at the end, there will be a thorough examination for India, who would have been watching anxiously, but ultimately in despair. They launched a huge franchise tournament, the Women's Premier League, in early 2023 to catch up with Australia and while it has seen the emergence of some young talent including spinner Shreyanka Patil and seamer Arundhati Reddy, this is a disappointing tournament from the 2020 finalists.They thrashed Sri Lanka and Pakistan, fought admirably against Australia but it was the opening defeat by New Zealand that left them with an uphill climb, one which proved too steep.New Zealand captain Sophie Devine: \"It hasn't sunk in yet. We will certainly celebrate tonight but this is just the next stage of a tournament we are looking forward to.\"On their young players: “It is about going in [to the semi-final] with open eyes and enjoying it. I want them to lap up the experience. It is an awesome opportunity for them and a huge part of their career. These are the reasons you play cricket.\"Pakistan captain Fatima Sana: \"We were good in the bowling but we need to improve our fielding and batting because we were not up to the mark. We need to improve or we can't survive at this level.\"England bowler Tash Farrant on BBC Test Match Special: “New Zealand's youngsters have come to the party in this tournament - like Eden Carson who bowled really well. They've not just relied on their senior players this time.“They've had a really tough time after the last World Cup in South Africa. But they are a tight-knit group and that is what is needed in these circumstances.”",
