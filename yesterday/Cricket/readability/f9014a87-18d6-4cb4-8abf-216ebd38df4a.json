Hazlewood removed Jomel Warrican to finish with 5-43 before Nathan Lyon bagged two wickets in the final over of the day, after play had been extended by 30 minutes, to seal the win.Earlier, Australia had made a battling 310 in their second innings after Alex Carey had top scored with a punchy 65.The tourists had resumed the day on a precarious 92-4 but Travis Head and Beau Webster made gritty scores of 61 and 63 before Carey batted smartly with the lower order as Joseph took 5-87.West Indies coach Daren Sammy met with match referee Javagal Srinath after play on day two to discuss concerns about some of the decisions made by TV umpire Adrian Holdstock during the match. Sammy said after play on Thursday that he was unhappy with some of the dismissals, external given by the South African using the technology.In West Indies' second innings, though, Sammy could have few complaints. Instead a tricky pitch, smart bowling from an Australian attack long in the tooth, and the odd daft shot proved to be West Indies' undoing.Mitchell Starc struck in his first over to remove Brathwaite before Carty and Campbell steadied the ship.The latter started the rot for West Indies when he bungled an attempted lap scoop against Hazlewood and left Carey with a simple catch.Shortly after Hazlewood dismissed Brandon King for a first-ball duck when he inside edged on to his pad and Cameron Green claimed the catch at gully.Another inside edge off the bat of West Indies skipper Roston Chase then popped up into the grateful hands of Sam Konstas at short leg.Hazlewood knocked back Carty's off stump with a full delivery and then returned to have Warrican caught at slip.West Indies looked like they might scrape into the fourth day as Joseph walloped four sixes in a Test-best 44 off 22 balls but Lyon got the job done in the final over of the day.\"I think once we saw West Indies take the second new ball today, we thought things could happen, but not that fast,\" Hazlewood said.\"There's a few cracks on a length from one end, some went low and got a few bowleds and lbws. We just kept hitting the right lengths time and again.\"",
