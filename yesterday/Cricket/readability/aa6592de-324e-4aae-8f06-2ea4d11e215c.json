  "text": "England fast bowler Jofra Archer has not been shortlisted for the Indian Premier League auction for 2025 but James Anderson is included.Batter Joe Root and fast bowler Mark Wood are also not among the 37 England-qualified players in the auction, which will be held on 24 and 25 November.Former England seam bowler Anderson, 42, has made the cut after the list was trimmed from 1,574 initial entries to 574 following consultation with the 10 IPL teams.All centrally-contracted England players were free to enter the auction.Archer's omission is eye-catching given his long battle with injuries and stated desire to return to Test cricket.It is not clear whether Archer, who was on the longlist, is missing from the shortlist because he pulled out or because he was cut.If Archer, 29, is to play Test cricket in 2025, he would likely have to play Championship cricket for Sussex in the early part of the English summer, which clashes with the IPL.Named the IPL's most valuable player in 2020, Archer has made his comeback from a series of back and elbow injuries this year in white-ball cricket, but it is still hoped he could feature against India next summer and in the 2025-26 Ashes in Australia.Under new rules, any overseas player who has previously played in the IPL but is not in this auction will not be able to play in 2025 or 2026, ruling out Archer, Wood, Root and England Test captain Ben Stokes, whose absence has been previously reported.England's leading wicket-taker Anderson, who retired from international duty in July, has not played since his final Test against West Indies at Lord's and has not played a T20 since 2014.Anderson has a reserve price of around £117,000.No English players were on the retained lists of the 10 IPL teams when they were confirmed last month.England white-ball captain Jos Buttler is one of 81 players in the auction with the highest reserve price of around £187,000.The dates for the 2025 IPL have not been confirmed, but this year it ran from 22 March to 26 May.England-qualified players in IPL 2025 auction:Jos Buttler, Liam Livingstone, Harry Brook, Jonny Bairstow, Phil Salt, Sam Curran, Adil Rashid, Tom Kohler-Cadmore, Ben Duckett, James Vince, Moeen Ali, Will Jacks, Tom Banton, Sam Billings, Jordan Cox, Gus Atkinson, Tom Curran, Ollie Pope, Richard Gleeson, Reece Topley, Luke Wood, Leus du Plooy, Michael Pepper, Jacob Bethell, Brydon Carse, Dan Mousley, Jamie Overton, Olly Stone, Dan Worrall, Matthew Potts, John Turner, Dan Lawrence, James Anderson, Chris Jordan, Tymal Mills, David Payne, Benny Howell.",
