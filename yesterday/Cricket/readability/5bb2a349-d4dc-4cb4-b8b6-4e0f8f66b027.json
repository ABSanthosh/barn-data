  "text": "England were left with plenty to consider after a disappointing Test series defeat in Pakistan.But one thing they no longer have to worry about is the World Test Championship with losses in Multan and Rawalpindi ending Ben Stokes' side's hopes of reaching next summer's final.However, with 20 Tests remaining in the 2023-2025 cycle, five teams are still in with a chance of making it to Lord's and playing for the right to be crowned World Test champions.Holders Australia are still firmly in the mix, as are India - beaten finalists in the first two editions of the competition - New Zealand, South Africa and Sri Lanka.BBC Sport has taken a look at what they each require to clinch a top-two spot and progress to the final...Each World Test Championship cycle runs for two years. The current one began in June 2023 and finishes with the final in June 2025.Teams play six series in that time - three at home and three away - with 12 points awarded for winning a match, six for a tie and four for a draw.However, as teams play a different number of Tests across their six series, the table is ranked by percentage of points won.So, a win (12 points) is 100%, a tie (six points) 50% and a draw (four points) 33.3%.Meanwhile, sides can be deducted points for a slow over-rate.October 2024: Bangladesh v South Africa (second Test of two-match series)November 2024: India v New Zealand (third Test of three-match series)November 2024-January 2025: Australia v India (five-match series)November-December 2024: West Indies v Bangladesh (two-match series)November-December 2024: South Africa v Sri Lanka (two-match series)November-December 2024: New Zealand v England (three-match series)December 2024-January 2025: South Africa v Pakistan (two-match series)January 2025: Pakistan v West Indies (two-match series)January 2025: Sri Lanka v Australia (two-match series)IndiaWhile India still lead the way as it stands, back-to-back home losses to New Zealand have made it that much tougher for Rohit Sharma's men to reach a third straight WTC final.It is still in their hands, though, and victory in the third Test against the Black Caps combined with winning three Tests in Australia would guarantee them a place in the showpiece game next summer.AustraliaFollowing India's slip ups against New Zealand, the equation is pretty simple for Australia: win five of their last seven matches and they'll go to Lord's for a chance to defend their title.Four wins - should three of them come against India - should be enough but anything less than five and other results become a factor.Sri LankaAs with Australia, it's a fairly straightforward scenario for Sri Lanka. Win all four of their remaining matches in the cycle and they will be in the final.That won't be easy against fellow contenders South Africa and Australia but three wins and a defeat might still be enough depending on results elsewhere.New ZealandAn historic series win in India has kept New Zealand, Test champions in 2021, in with a chance of returning to the final.Even victory in all four of their remaining Tests - one in India and three at home to England - would not assure them of a top-two place but it would give them a very good chance.South AfricaAs it stands, the Proteas require five wins from five to be completely sure of a berth in the final.Four wins and a draw would give them a strong chance, while even four wins and a loss would not completely end their chances.However, in both instances, they would need other results to go their way.England, Pakistan, Bangladesh and West Indies are no longer in contention to reach the final.But, of course, it is worth noting that it could all change again if any side is deducted points for a slow over-rate, as five teams have in this cycle, including both England and Australia during the 2023 Ashes.The World Test Championship was launched in 2019 by the International Cricket Council (ICC) so that each format of the game had a pinnacle tournament. The previous winners are:2019-2021: New Zealand (beating India)2021-2023: Australia (beating India)The 2025 World Test Championship final will take place at Lord's in England. The five-day match is scheduled to begin on Wednesday, 11 June.There will be ball-by-ball radio commentary available across the BBC.",
