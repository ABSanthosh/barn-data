  "text": "England have called up uncapped wicketkeeper-batter Ollie Robinson for the last two Tests of their ongoing series against New Zealand. Robinson has been drafted in as cover for Jordan Cox, another uncapped wicketkeeper-batter who was set to take the gloves for all three Tests before a thumb injury sustained in training ruled him out of the entire tour. Regular wicketkeeper Jamie Smith is missing the series on paternity leave. Cox picked up his injury on Sunday (November 24) but Robinson's call-up was only finalised today (November 28) after there were logistical issues getting the Durham gloveman over to New Zealand; Robinson needed to renew his passport before travelling having not been informed he was considered as a back-up for the tour. That delay eradicated the slim possibility of Robinson flying in for the series opener. The gloves were instead handed to Ollie Pope and the spot in the top seven left vacant by Cox's injury was filled by 21-year-old Warwickshire batter Jacob Bethell. Not only was Bethell selected, but he was given the responsibility of batting at No.3 in a rejigged order, something he has never previously done in first-class cricket. Bethell is also yet to score a professional hundred, the first specialist batsman picked for England in Test cricket without a first-class hundred to their name since Mike Gatting in 1978. Robinson has been rewarded for two fine campaigns at his adopted home at Durham. Since moving north from Kent, Robinson averages 53 with the bat in the County Championship. In 2024, the 25-year-old enjoyed an excellent season in Division One though his numbers did wane towards the end of the summer. Cover StoriesSeries Cover StoriesCover Stories UK",
