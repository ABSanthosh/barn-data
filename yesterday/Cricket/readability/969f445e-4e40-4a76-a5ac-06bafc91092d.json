  "text": "West Indies won by 8 wickets (with 6 balls remaining) (DLS method)Player Of The Match102* (61)Player Of The Series145 runs • 1 wktReportSL scored 156 in rain-reduced game, with WI's target revised to 195, and Sherfane Rutherford smashed 50* off 26 deliveriesEvin Lewis scored 102 off 61 balls in his first ODI since 2021  •  Associated Press(23 overs) West Indies 196 for 2 (Lewis 102*, Rutherford 50*, Asitha 1-39) beat Sri Lanka 156 for 3 (Kusal 56, Nissanka 56, Chase 1-20) by eight wickets (DLS method)After a series in which they consistently failed to get the rub of the green, the stars finally aligned for West Indies as they ended their tour of Sri Lanka with a morale-boosting win. Evin Lewis, playing his first ODI since 2021, struck an unbeaten 102 off 61 balls, as West Indies chased down a DLS-adjusted target of 195 in a rain-reduced game of 23 overs with eight wickets to spare. In fact, they got the required runs with an over to spare. It was their first ODI win in Sri Lanka following ten straight defeats, and their first win on this tour since the first T20I.Sri Lanka, for their part, had put up a valiant effort after their innings had been cut into less than half. The first 17.2 overs had come prior to the rain intervention, and upon resumption, they were given just a further 5.4 overs to set a competitive total.Enter Kusal Mendis, who bludgeoned an unbeaten 56 off 22 deliveries - he got the half-century off 19 balls - as Sri Lanka themselves struck 75 runs in those final 5.4 overs to end on 156 for 3, and gave themselves a fighting chance. In the end, though, a combination of a wet outfield, wet ball and a laser-focused Lewis proved too much to overcome.Brandon King (18 off 19 balls) and Shai Hope (22 off 27) had kept Lewis company for most of the chase, but it wasn't until Sherfane Rutherford joined him in the middle that West Indies truly took control of proceedings.Rutherford's brisk cameo saw him plunder 50 off just 26 deliveries, including four fours and three sixes, with his partnership with Lewis amounting to an unbeaten 88 from just 45 deliveries. It was a pivotal stand in the context of the game, as it came just as Sri Lanka might have been harbouring thoughts of a late heist.With the required run rate at roughly 8.5 an over from the outset, West Indies had done well to just about keep up with it over the opening ten overs - there was at least one boundary in seven of the first 11 overs. But in such a short chase, even a couple of quiet overs can heighten the pressure - and so it proved to be.Between the 11th and 17th overs, Sri Lanka gave away just 40 runs as the required rate rose to above 11.50 runs an over. Skipper Charith Asalanka had done well in this period by shuffling his pack to sneak in some cheap overs from himself and Kamindu Mendis - both of whom made up the fifth-bowler quota after Wanindu Hasaranga had struggled with controlling a wet ball.Where Asalanka erred was in bowling himself for one over too many, which allowed Rutherford and Lewis to go after him. That 14-run over set the tone, after which the pair never looked back. The miserly Maheesh Theekshana was rinsed for 18 in the next over, while even the excellent Asitha Fernando was hounded for 26 off his final two. Dilshan Madushanka, playing his first ODI since March, went for 50 in five.Sri Lanka, though, will have positives to take away from this game, particularly in how aggressively they approached the post-rain period, knowing that they didn't have much time to scrounge up a competitive total. The opening 17.2 overs had seen Sri Lanka stitch together a measured start, with openers Pathum Nissanka and Avishka Fernando putting on 81.That, though, owed much to West Indies dropping three chances - two of Nissanka and one of Avishka - inside the opening ten overs. This poor catching did not get much better after the five-hour rain delay, with Kusal also dropped twice on the way to becoming the third-quickest Sri Lanka batter to 4000 ODI runs.It all began with the four balls left in Roston Chase's second over, as Kusal proceeded to clatter each of them for boundaries - two precise pulls, one stunning straight drive, and finally a fortunate inside edge down to fine leg. In all, Sri Lanka struck 12 boundaries in the final 34 deliveries they faced.The shortened game also had some knock-on effects on West Indies' bowling plans, as the new provisos meant three bowlers were given a quota of five overs each, while two others were handed four apiece. Once Chase's over, in which Kusal had struck four consecutive boundaries, was belatedly completed, and with Sri Lanka in raucous mood, West Indies were suddenly faced with the proposition of figuring out how Gudakesh Motie, Jayden Seales, and Alzarri Joseph - who had bowled four, four and three overs, respectively - would split the remains.And with the economical Matthew Forde already having bowled five overs prior to the rain break, it meant only two more bowlers could bowl five; so they needed to find one more over from somewhere.With Chase having been dispatched upon the resumption of play, it was left to Rutherford to roll his arm over, and he was duly taken for 17 runs courtesy two fours and a six. And as Kusal's carefree innings continued in earnest, Sri Lanka eventually managed to muster up a competitive total - though it proved to be just not good enough on the day.SLWI100%50%100%SL InningsWI InningsOver 22 • WI 196/2West Indies won by 8 wickets (with 6 balls remaining) (DLS method)Powered by Smart StatsInstant answers to T20 questions",

And as Kusal\u0026#39;s carefree innings continued in earnest, Sri Lanka eventually managed to muster up a competitive total - though it proved to be just not good enough on the day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSL\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWI\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e100%\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e50%\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e100%\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg viewBox=\"0 0 300 200\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\u003e\u003cg\u003e\u003cline x1=\"0\" x2=\"300\" y1=\"200\" y2=\"200\"\u003e\u003c/line\u003e\u003c/g\u003e\u003cg\u003e\u003cline x1=\"0\" x2=\"300\" y1=\"100\" y2=\"100\"\u003e\u003c/line\u003e\u003c/g\u003e\u003cg\u003e\u003cline x1=\"69\" x2=\"69\" y1=\"0\" y2=\"200\"\u003e\u003c/line\u003e\u003c/g\u003e\u003cpolyline points=\"3,102.12 6,108.5 9,108.8 12,106.04 15,111.7 18,97.56 21,104.22 24,99.6 27,94.9 30,93.16 33,104.28 36,97.48 39,102.68 42,93.06 45,91.3 48,90.96 51,84.78 54,129.45999999999998 57,120.28 60,118.74 63,102.06 66,97.02 69,91.32 72,28.3 75,34.16 78,30.8 81,29.1 84,32.14 87,24.2 90,35.88 93,34.04 96,42.36 99,30.1 102,36.98 105,33.38 108,20.58 111,15.22 114,19.4 117,12.5 120,7.04 123,15.06 126,91.18 129,97.66 132,160.88 135,200\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#E49042\" stroke-width=\"2\"\u003e\u003c/polyline\u003e\u003cdefs\u003e\u003cmask id=\"myMask\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"\u003e\u003cpolyline fill=\"none\" points=\"3,102.12 6,108.5 9,108.8 12,106.04 15,111.7 18,97.56 21,104.22 24,99.6 27,94.9 30,93.16 33,104.28 36,97.48 39,102.68 42,93.06 45,91.3 48,90.96 51,84.78 54,129.45999999999998 57,120.28 60,118.74 63,102.06 66,97.02 69,91.32 72,28.3 75,34.16 78,30.8 81,29.1 84,32.14 87,24.2 90,35.88 93,34.04 96,42.36 99,30.1 102,36.98 105,33.38 108,20.58 111,15.22 114,19.4 117,12.5 120,7.04 123,15.06 126,91.18 129,97.66 132,160.88 135,200\" stroke=\"white\" stroke-width=\"2\"\u003e\u003c/polyline\u003e\u003c/mask\u003e\u003c/defs\u003e\u003crect fill=\"#03A9F4\" x=\"0\" y=\"100\" width=\"300\" height=\"100\" mask=\"url(#myMask)\"\u003e\u003c/rect\u003e\u003ctext x=\"50\" y=\"196\"\u003eSL Innings\u003c/text\u003e\u003ctext x=\"200\" y=\"196\"\u003eWI Innings\u003c/text\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"54\" cy=\"129.45999999999998\" r=\"3\" stroke-width=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"66\" cy=\"97.02\" r=\"3\" stroke-width=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"69\" cy=\"91.32\" r=\"3\" stroke-width=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"87\" cy=\"24.2\" r=\"3\" stroke-width=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"114\" cy=\"19.4\" r=\"3\" stroke-width=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver 22 • WI 196/2\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWest Indies won by 8 wickets (with 6 balls remaining) (DLS method)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg width=\"12\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://wassets.hscicdn.com/static/images/lazyimage-noaspect.svg\"/\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePowered by Smart Stats\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/ask\"\u003e\u003cimg width=\"135\" alt=\"AskESPNcricinfo Logo\" src=\"https://wassets.hscicdn.com/static/images/lazyimage-noaspect.svg\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eInstant answers to T20 questions\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
