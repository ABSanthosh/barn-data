It had been on loan to the Bradman Museum in the player’s home town of Bowral since 2010 and was sold as a single star lot to an Australian bidder in the room.It was bought for $390,000 before the addition of a buyer’s premium was added to the fee.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThe cap was described by the auction house as “sun faded and worn”, with “some insect damage” and “some loss to edge of peak”.“This very special baggy green has been part of cricket and sporting heritage for decades,” said Bonham’s senior specialist Alex Clark.Bradman, who died in 2001 at the age of 92, is recognised as cricket’s greatest batter after averaging 99.94 in his 52-Test career.",
