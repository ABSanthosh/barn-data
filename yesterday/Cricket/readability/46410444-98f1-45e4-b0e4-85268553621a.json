  "text": "The third day of the World Test Championship final ended amid raucous scenes among the South Africa fans in the stands but possibly also with popping corks in the Lord’s pavilion as it emerged that England is likely to host the showpiece event for another three cycles.Arun Singh Dhumal, chair of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, informed the International Cricket Council in April that it would like to host the next final in 2027 and such is the BCCI’s power in the international game the move was seen as overwhelmingly likely.But the ICC’s chair, Jay Shah – himself formerly of the BCCI and the son of Amit Shah, India’s minister of home affairs – has been at Lord’s to witness a well organised and enthusiastically supported third final on British shores, and the England and Wales Cricket Board has been informed that a decision to keep the event in England is likely to be ratified at the governing body’s annual conference in Singapore next month.The first WTC final, in which New Zealand beat India, was held in biosecure conditions in 2021 at Southampton’s Utilita Bowl and two years later India lost the second to Australia at the Oval, before its move to Lord’s this summer. If the decision is confirmed England would continue to host the event until at least 2031. The country is unique in its ability to fill the stands even for neutral matches and in having the ideal climate to host the match in its current and favoured June window. Unless the political situation changes any final in India would probably need to be relocated should Pakistan qualify, with relations between the two countries currently hostile.South Africa look set to become the third winner in the tournament’s short history, after the unexpected outbreak of ideal batting conditions prompted an outstanding and unbeaten partnership of 143 between Aiden Markram – who finished unbeaten on 102 – and his captain, Temba Bavuma, who at stumps stood on 65. Their performance carried the team to the verge of victory over Australia and a desperately-sought first ICC title since the 1998 Champions Trophy: they finished the day on 213 for two, 69 runs away from equalling the second-highest successful chase in Test matches at Lord’s.Aiden Markram and Temba Bavuma put on an unbeaten stand of 143 on day three at Lord’s. Photograph: Ben Whitley/PA“This would be massive for our country,” said Ashwell Prince, the team’s batting coach. “We’ve fallen short in some white-ball competitions with teams that have had very good chances of getting over the line, possibly favourites at times. But we haven’t done it yet, so we have got to knuckle down.”After 14 wickets fell on each of the first two days only four followed on the third, which started with a 59-run last-wicket partnership between Australia’s Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood that, while making their own task more testing, South Africa saw primarily as encouragement.“There was a little bit of frustration but we try to stick to the positives as much as we can,” Prince said. “Their tailenders were pretty comfortable against a pretty good bowling attack and you can feed off those things – if you reverse that it might happen when we bat. The message has been the same throughout: make them believe they can do it, and then step out of the way and allow them to go and do it.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionAustralia’s assistant coach Daniel Vettori admitted the chances of his side turning the tide are now slim. “I think we understand the magnitude of the task,” he said. “It’s going to be a real challenge. It was an exceptional partnership, they navigated any tricky times and then were able to put pressure on us through their running, through their ability to dissect the field – it was a real clinic from those two. The hope for us is that we can get a wicket or two in the morning and just see what that looks like.”Bavuma spent the last 33 overs of the day labouring with a hamstring injury that nearly forced him out of the game. “At tea we had to make a big call, whether he continues to bat,” Prince said. “Both of them were adamant that Temba’s got to continue. Temba’s had to fight throughout his career and this could be a defining moment for him, on the biggest stage.”",
