  "text": "Former Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal has thanked doctors for their \"amazing\" care after he posted on social media for the first time since he suffered a cardiac arrest.The 36-year-old required medical attention during a domestic T20 game in Dhaka and is currently recovering in hospital.Tamim, Bangladesh's record run-scorer in one-day internationals, complained of chest pains after taking to the field for Mohammedan Sporting Club in their Dhaka Premier League fixture against Shinepukur on Monday.Plans to transport him in a helicopter were abandoned as his condition deteriorated and he was instead taken for emergency treatment at a closer facility, the KPJ Specialized Hospital.Tamim is set remain in hospital for another 48 to 72 hours for observation having been given angioplasty to relieve a blockage of the arteries.\"The heartbeat is what keeps us alive, but this can cease without any announcement - we repeatedly forget this. Did I know what was going to happen to me when I started the day yesterday?\" Tamim wrote on his Facebook, external page.\"I have returned with the infinite mercy of Allah and everyone's prayers. I'm lucky, I had some amazing people by my side during this crisis, with whose tireless efforts I've overcome this crisis.\"Some events remind us of reality, how short life really is. Everyone pray for me and my family. I, Tamim Iqbal, am nothing without your love.\"Tamim represented Bangladesh 391 times across all formats between 2007 and 2023, scoring 15,249‬ runs.",
