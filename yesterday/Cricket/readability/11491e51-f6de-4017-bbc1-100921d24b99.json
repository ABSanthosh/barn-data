But the damage of the Hlubi over had already been done, and by the time Sciver-Brunt, who scored 59 off 54 balls, was caught at backward square leg, England required just one run from the final five balls – a mere formality .Knight had vehemently defended her team on the eve of the series in the face of strong criticism following their early World Cup exit – adopting the slightly odd mantra that there was no need for England to “rip up trees” – but admitted that their win in Sunday’s match was far from perfect.Knight said: “It was a little bit scrappy. It’s really pleasing to get a win, but there’s a few things we can sharpen up on. The smartness of Nat’s innings was brilliant, aided by that momentum-shift from Amy. That took the game back in our favour.”England may have secured first blood, but their chaotic buildup to the series – epitomised by Alice Capsey going from “dropped” to “reserve wicketkeeper” in the space of six days, after a spate of England injuries culminated in Bess Heath being sent home with a fractured thumb – at times translated on to the pitch.First, they let South Africa add 42 runs at the death after a sluggish middle-innings, allowing them to post a total far in excess of where they should have been.
