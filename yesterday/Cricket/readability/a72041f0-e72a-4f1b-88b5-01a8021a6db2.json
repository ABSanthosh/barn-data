  "text": "NewsJosh Hazlewood sat the RCB vs CSK game out, and missed a chance to earn the Purple Cap back from Prasidh KrishnaOrange Cap tableIt didn't take Virat Kohli long. After B Sai Sudharsan, the Gujarat Titans (GT) opener, won it back from Kohli on Friday, Kohli snatched it right back when he scored 62 in 33 balls for RCB against CSK at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. Not much between them, though, Kohli is on 505 runs from 11 innings, while Sai Sudharsan is one run behind, from one fewer innings.Now, while Kohli is the top run-getter, RCB's next most prolific run-scorer is Devdutt Padikkal with just 247 runs, down at No. 26.Purple Cap tableJosh Hazlewood didn't play the game against CSK, and that means he remains one wicket behind table-topper Prasidh Krishna of GT. Prasidh has 19 wickets from ten games, while Hazlewood has 18 from ten.Khaleel Ahmed's wicketless - and very expensive - outing meant he remained at 14 wickets for the season, but his team-mate Noor Ahmad got back on level terms with MI's Trent Boult at 16 wickets to be joint-third. Krunal Pandya picked up one wicket for RCB against CSK, and that took him to 14, the same as Khaleel as well as GT's Mohammed Siraj and Delhi Capitals' Mitchell Starc.Here are some other IPL 2025 tables.
