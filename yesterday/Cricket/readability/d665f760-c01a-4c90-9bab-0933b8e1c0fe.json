  "text": "The 2024/25 Big Bash League will get underway on December 15. Here are the full squad lists for the 14th edition of the tournament, including injury updates and team news. A draft for the tournament was held in September and saw some notable action. Laurie Evans moved from long-term BBL home Perth Scorchers, who were unable to use their retention option with limited funds remaining in their purse. Scorchers also signed Finn Allen to bolster their batting ranks. Hobart Hurricanes signed Bangladesh's Rishad Hossain, who was set to become only the second Bangladesh player to feature in the BBL, the other being Shakib-Al-Hasan. However, Hossain has since pulled out of the tournament, which clashes with the BPL. There was another leg-spinner given a surprising first gig in the BBL, with English leggie Jafer Chohan picked up by Sydney Sixers. Chohan has yet to earn his maiden international cap, but took 17 wickets for Yorkshire in the 2024 T20 Blast, and was selected in England's squad to play West Indies recently. Since the draft, David Warner has been named as Sydney Thunder captain following the overturn of his leadership ban by Cricket Australia. Marcus Stoinis has also been named as Melbourne Stars captain, taking over from Glenn Maxwell who resigned at the end of last summer. Maxwell is battling injury to be able to participate in the tournament, having picked up a hamstring injury in Australia's white-ball series against Pakistan. He has a tight race against time to be fit for the start of the BBL.
