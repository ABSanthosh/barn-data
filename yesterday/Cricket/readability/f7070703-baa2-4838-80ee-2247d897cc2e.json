The most expensive figures in T20 international history were registered by Gambia's Musa Jobarteh, who conceded 93 against Zimbabwe last year, while Sri Lanka's Kasun Rajitha has the worst figures between two Test-playing nations with 0-75 against Australia in 2019. Archer's Royals were subjected to a brutal onslaught from the Sunrisers, as they posted 286-6 in the second match of this season's IPL.The score was one run short of Sunrisers' own record for the highest team total in the IPL, which they scored against Royal Challengers Bengaluru last year.India batter Ishan Kishan finished unbeaten with a stunning 106 from just 47 balls, which included 11 fours and six sixes, while Australia opener Travis Head kickstarted the remarkable innings with 67 from 31. Sunrisers reached 94-1 from the six-over powerplay and the Royals failed to recover, with the score passing 200 in the 15th over before South Africa's Heinrich Klaasen added late firepower with 34 from 14 balls in support of Kishan.In reply, Royals slipped to 50-3 before a fourth-wicket stand of 111 between opener Sanju Samson and Dhruv Jurel kept their hopes alive. But they fell in consecutive overs with Samson making 66 from 37 balls and Jurel scoring 70 from 35, with the monumental target never feeling quite within the Royals' grasp as they fell short on 242-6.Harshal Patel was the pick of Sunrisers' bowlers with 2-34, while Australia's Pat Cummins struggled with figures of 0-60.Sunrisers reached the IPL final in 2024 but were beaten by Kolkata Knight Riders, who lost the opening match of the tournament to RCB on Saturday.In Sunday's second match, New Zealand's Rachin Ravindra struck an unbeaten 65 to guide Chennai Super Kings to a four-wicket win over Mumbai Indians.Jofra Archer (0-76) - Rajasthan Royals v Sunrisers Hyderabad, 2025Mohit Sharma (0-73) - Gujarat Titans v Delhi Capitals, 2024Basil Thampi (0-70) - Sunrisers Hyderabad v Royal Challengers Bengaluru, 2018Yash Dayal (0-69) - Gujarat Titans v Kolkata Knight Riders, 2023 Reece Topley (1-68) - Royal Challengers Bengaluru v Sunrisers Hyderabad, 2024",
