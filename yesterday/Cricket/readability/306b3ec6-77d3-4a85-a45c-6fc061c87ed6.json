  "text": "Brydon Carse claimed a ten-wicket match haul to put England on the brink of victory in the first Test against New Zealand, the first by an England quick in an overseas Test since 2008. Ryan Sidebottom was the bowler on that occasion, with his ten-for also coming against New Zealand, at Hamilton, though Carse’s 10-126 surpassed Sidebottom’s 10-139. The last England fast bowler to claim better figures overseas was Matthew Hoggard, who took 12-205 against South Africa at Johannesburg in January 2005. Several notable England quicks never took a ten-wicket haul away from home, including Stuart Broad and James Anderson, their two leading wicket-takers in the format. It's the 26th ten-wicket haul by an England seamer overseas, with Carse the 18th to take one, four bowlers having claimed multiple such hauls. Globally, overseas ten-wicket match hauls are a rare sight. Carse's Christchurch ten-for is the just the fourth such haul by a seamer in an away Test in the last decade. Carse bowled with pace, hostility and skill throughout the game, taking four wickets in the first innings and six in the second. Notably, several of his wickets came with the older ball and via a variety of routes. Daryl Mitchell, Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra were bounced out, Tom Latham was nicked off, and Glenn Phillips and Nathan Smith were pinned lbw. Tom Blundell was the only member of New Zealand’s top seven not to fall to Carse at least once in the game. His efforts set England on the victory path, with New Zealand bowled out for 348 and 254. Harry Brook’s 171 boosted England to 499, leaving them a chase of 103 for a series lead. Brydon Carse is the first English seamer to take 10 in a match overseas since Ryan Sidebottom in Hamilton in 2008.It's something that neither Anderson nor Broad achieved in their careers. — Yas Rana (@Yas_Wisden) December 1, 2024 Carse, 29 years old, has been an increasingly regular member of England’s white-ball sides since his ODI debut in 2021. He made his Test debut in Pakistan, fast-tracked into the team following the conclusion of a ban for historical betting offences. He impressed on that tour, claiming nine wickets in two Tests at 24.33, but was without a standout haul to his name. He has that now as he continues his stellar start to his career in England whites.
