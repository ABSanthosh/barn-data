But that did not stop Rob Key, director of men’s cricket, openly pondering a move to split the white‑ball roles and see if Stokes could combine the 50-over job with his Test duties.In the end, mindful that Stokes is on the comeback trail from hamstring surgery, and about to start an Ashes year that will define his Test captaincy, Key offered both the Twenty20 and one‑day international jobs to Brook.It hands the 26‑year‑old the chance to lead England during the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka next year, plus its 50-over equivalent in Africa in 2027.“It’s a real honour to be named England’s white-ball captain,” Brook said.“Ever since I was a kid playing cricket at Burley in Wharfedale, I dreamed of representing Yorkshire, playing for England, and maybe one day leading the team. To now be given that chance means a great deal to me. I’m excited to get going and give it everything I’ve got.”It will likely be required, with Brook’s status as an all-format international meaning a significant workload lies ahead. This summer, for example, features six Tests and 12 white-ball fixtures at home, plus a short T20 tour of Ireland in late September. Given his centrality to the Test side, fears about overloading Brook are understandable, not least given tours of New Zealand, Australia and the subcontinent next winter.Key said: “[Brook] has been part of our succession planning for some time, albeit this opportunity has come slightly earlier than expected. Harry is not only an outstanding cricketer, but also has an excellent cricketing brain and a clear vision for both teams that will help drive us towards winning more series and major global tournaments.”England’s view is that the physical strain is far less for specialist batters and, while he may in time miss the odd white-ball series to rest, there are enough breaks in the schedule to make it manageable. It may be that Brook is now rarely seen in domestic cricket, however, having already withdrawn from the Indian Premier League this year.That decision also means April and May are clear next year, with players who pull out from the IPL for reasons other than injury suspended from two editions of the tournament. Brook notably cited the need to prioritise England when he gave up his £590,000 deal with Delhi Capitals: a call to rest that perhaps reflected his expected promotion and, more broadly, the financial security of his top-tier central contract.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionQuick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Brook takes on the role despite being relatively light on domestic experience, having briefly captained Yorkshire in the T20 Blast three summers ago and then spent last season leading Northern Superchargers in the Hundred. He was also previously captain of England Under‑19s, even if he was suspended for the final match of the Under-19s World Cup in 2018 for off-field disciplinary reasons.There was, though, an encouraging spell in charge of England’s ODI team last summer when Buttler was injured: a 3-2 series defeat against Australia in which Brook averaged 78 with the bat.Ultimately, with all England men’s teams coached by Brendon McCullum since the start of the year, there is a belief that Brook’s naturally aggressive outlook makes him a good fit. In time, he may well be seen as successor to Stokes in the Test setup.Ollie Pope is the Test vice-captain but ended the 2-1 win in New Zealand last December with his position in doubt after playing as a stand-in wicketkeeper and Jacob Bethell impressing in his preferred No 3 spot.Selection for the one-off Test against Zimbabwe in late May could yet hinge on the IPL, however, with Bethell unlikely to be back should his Royal Challengers Bangalore side reach the playoffs.",
