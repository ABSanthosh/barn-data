So I missed out a few times with the bat and unfortunately wasn't able to take my opportunity but as I said I'll work really to make sure that if the opportunity comes round again I'm definitely ready.\"Speaking subsequently to News Corp on arrival in Brisbane, McSweeney detailed the challenges of Bumrah.\"They had seen my results against Bumrah in the first three Tests and George said they wanted to try someone else who has a slightly different skill set and that suits the batting order,\" he said. \"I faced some balls and spent a bit of time out there so that helped my confidence but I did not get the scores that I wanted. As everyone was saying it probably does not get much harder.\"\"But learning on the go is a different challenge. In Sheffield Shield cricket you face a good bowler and you might see him again after Christmas. It's different and unique playing a five Test series and fronting up against him a week later so you are thinking on the run a lot.\"McSweeney's route back to Test cricket would now appear to be in the middle order although he will need to wait for a vacancy to open up. The return of Cameron Green from injury later in the year will create competition for those batting positions.\"[It was a] really hard decision for Nathan and one that we spent a lot of time deliberating over,\" he said. \"Particularly after a small sample size of three Tests… That's never a great phone call, is it? Nathan was disappointed and really the message to him was much the same as at the start of the series, that we believe he has the ability and temperament to succeed at Test level.\"Whether McSweeney is available for Brisbane Heat on Sunday, when they face Adelaide Strikers at the Gabba in the BBL, will be confirmed later on Saturday.",
