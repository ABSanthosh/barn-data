Set an improbable 351 to win, the Proteas crumbled to 64 all out, which is their lowest total in women's Tests. Seamer Lauren Bell was the standout for England, taking 4-27, while spinner Sophie Ecclestone finished with 2-7. England started the day with a lead of 145 and were bowled out for 281 shortly before tea, with captain Heather Knight providing the backbone of the innings with a composed 90. Faced with a tricky 20-minute spell before the interval, Bell took the key scalp of Laura Wolvaardt for four and fellow seamer Lauren Filer trapped Anneke Bosch in front for the same score. The turning point came after the break when England appealed for a catch at short leg off Annerie Dercksen, with the on-field umpire initially unmoved. But the decision was then overturned after a consultation with the third umpire, despite the fact the decision review system (DRS) is not in place for the match. South Africa were visibly unhappy with the decision and from there they collapsed by losing their final seven wickets for just 42 runs, with Marizanne Kapp's 21 the only noteable contribution. The dismal batting effort overshadowed the brilliant bowling effort of spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba, who took 6-67 to finish with 10 in the match. The victory ensures England head to January's Ashes in Australia with plenty of confidence having also won both preceding white-ball series on this tour. No DRS dominates discussion While the margin of victory was eventually very comfortable for England, the lack of DRS cast an unfortunate shadow over the match in general. The preceding white-ball series both had the system in place for the first time in women's bilateral internationals in South Africa but because of the costs involved, Cricket South Africa said they were prioritising its use in the shorter formats only. , externalThere are always going to be mistakes made by human error but it meant that those decisions were amplified further in Bloemfontein, including an appeal for lbw against Tammy Beaumont from the second ball of the match which looked plumb and Wolvaardt's fury at being given out the same way but having hit the ball. On day three, it was Dercksen's wicket which led to widespread confusion and lack of clarity around what exactly the third umpire could decide on.There appeared to be no doubt about the fact Beaumont had taken the catch cleanly at short leg off Bell's bowling because it popped up straight to her at chest height, but umpires Kerrin Klaaste and Lauren Agenbag - both officiating in their first Tests - had a discussion after England's convincing appeal. There was also no UltraEdge to determine whether Dercksen had hit it, though the slow motion replay made it look likely and therefore it was probably the correct decision, yet it was the inconsistency of the process that was questioned. Dercksen's wicket left the score 22-3 and led to a visibly-annoyed South Africa's capitulation.South Africa implode after Knight finds formImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Nat Sciver-Brunt and Heather Knight added 67 for England's third wicket England started the day in a comfortable position but Knight pressed home their advantage with a patient 90 from 191 balls in the face of a much-improved bowling performance from the hosts. With injuries to seamers Kapp and Hlubi thwarting South Africa, Mlaba stepped up to bowl with impressive control and guile for 26 overs and was rewarded by becoming her country's first bowler to take 10 wickets in a women's Test. She had Nat Sciver-Brunt dropped on 19 but fought back to bowl the first-innings centurion for 37, before adding Amy Jones, Charlie Dean, Sophie Ecclestone and Ryana MacDonald-Gay to her tally as England tried to score quick runs with a declaration looming. A mini collapse of 4-12 at the end of England's innings was a slight blemish but Knight's return to form is another tick for the side with a challenging Ashes series on the horizon, as she struck 10 fours in the innings before missing a sweep off Mlaba and being pinned on the back leg. In reply, South Africa folded meekly. Wolvaardt is usually their rock but was undone by a nip-backer from Bell, who also bowled Sune Luus - who made a gritty 56 in the first innings - with a beautiful swinging delivery.When Kapp was caught in close by Beaumont, their final hope departed and the innings was over inside 19.4 overs with the injured number 11 Hlubi unable to bat.More on this story",
