The only century Suryavanshi was going to see this day was Rajasthan’s 100-run defeat lit up on the scoreboard, signifying the end of the Royals’ title hopes.Mumbai’s India captain Rohit Sharma gave Suryavanshi a pat and some uplifting words after the match, and the fuss gave an idea of just how much the youngster’s achievements have captured the imagination.But reality bit quickly once Mumbai, who had been put in, established a total that set up their sixth consecutive win to go top of the table.South African player of the match Ryan Rickelton (61) and Sharma (53) put on 116 for the first wicket, before the tournament’s top run-scorer Suryakumar Yadav and captain Hardik Pandya upped the ante with unbeaten knocks of 48, pounding 94 off just 44 balls for the third wicket.In reply, Rajasthan slumped to 47-5 inside the powerplay with their formidable opening attack of Trent Boult (3-28) and Jasprit Bumrah (2-15) proving too much for the hosts, before impact sub Karn Sharma spun the lower order out to finish with 3-23.Sunday will be the next chance for India to see Suryavanshi in action at the country’s greatest cricket arena, Eden Gardens in Kolkata where the Knight Riders will host the Royals.",
