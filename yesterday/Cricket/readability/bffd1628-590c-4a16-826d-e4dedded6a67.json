  "text": "Completing a daunting chase to win the second Test in Pakistan would be a bigger achievement that the run-filled victory in the first, according to England assistant coach Paul Collingwood.The tourists broke a host of records in taking the first Test by an innings, including posting 823-7 declared, their highest total since 1938.They have been set 297 to win the second Test and a successful pursuit would comfortably be their highest chase to win a Test in Asia.On a dusty surface in Multan, re-used from the first match and therefore in its eighth day of action, England ended the third day of the second Test on 36-2.\"We’ll still have that belief,\" said Collingwood. \"We know it’s going to be tough and we’ve got to be realistic, but we’ll find ways to put them under pressure.\"If England do pull off the chase, it would also be their joint third-highest in an overseas Test and the best by any visiting team in Pakistan.After giving up a first-innings deficit of 75 runs, England eventually dismissed Pakistan for 221 on the third day.They were given 11 overs to bat before the close, only to lose openers Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley.Under coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes, England have created a reputation for overhauling targets.Asked if a win in this match would outstrip the success of last week, former England all-rounder Collingwood said: \"It would, under the circumstances and conditions we’ve been given this time.\"There’s still hope, and there’s only hope because of the amazing things these guys have done in the past.\"England’s target would have been more manageable had it not been for some crucial dropped catches in the afternoon session.Salman Agha was put down on four and six by wicketkeeper Jamie Smith and first-slip Joe Root respectively, both in the same Brydon Carse over. Had one of the chances been taken, Pakistan would have been six wickets down with their lead still below 200.In the case of 24-year-old Smith, it was probably his worst error with the gloves in eight Tests since making his debut in July.\"I’m sure he’ll be disappointed but he certainly doesn’t show it,\" said Collingwood. \"He never seems to change his demeanour, no matter what’s happening, which to me is a great trait.\"It’s been amazing to have someone so level-headed, it feels like he’s been around for years.\"Salman went on to make 63, adding 65 for the ninth wicket with Sajid Khan. It was off-spinner Sajid, following seven wickets in England’s first innings, who struck first to remove Duckett in the second, before Crawley was stumped off Noman Ali.\"We are ahead of the game, there’s no doubt about that, but we all know England can put the momentum very quickly to their side,\" Salman told Test Match Special. \"We need be aware of that and we need to be doing the good things we’re doing.\"We were looking for anything around 200, 200-plus, but me and Sajid put up a great partnership.\"We wanted at least one wicket, but to get both openers is why I am saying we are ahead of the game. We should win from here but we have to do good things consistently.\"",
