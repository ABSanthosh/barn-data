The former India cricketer also named Mitchell Marsh who should be retained for the upcoming season of the T20 tournament.\"We have heard a lot of speculation on whether Rishabh Pant will be retained or not. Time will tell, but if I was a part of the management there, then I would have retained him. Rishabh Pant should be retained. Axar Patel should be retained. Stubbs should be retained. And the 4th player to be retained will be Fraser McGurk. And if you want to retain the 5th player, then it could be Mitch Marsh. Apart from that, I think there is no other player that you would want to retain. Out of those 5 players, I think Delhi Capitals should retain at least 4 of them,\" Harbhajan was quoted in a release from Star Sports as saying.Earlier in the month, former Indian cricketers Hemang Badani and Venugopal Rao joined the coaching staff of Delhi Capitals as head coach and director of cricket, respectively, ahead of the next season of the IPL.Meanwhile, cricketing icon and one of India's most successful captains, Sourav Ganguly has been named as Director of Cricket for JSW Sports.
