  "text": "Harry Brook is \"by far and away the best player in the world\", according to his England team-mate Joe Root.Root, 33, is ranked as the number one batter in the world by the International Cricket Council, one place ahead of Brook.Brook made 123 in England's defeat of New Zealand in Wellington, his second century of the series following a triple-century on the tour of Pakistan.\"To be able to construct an innings like that off the back of another exceptional hundred the week before, with such an all-round game - he can absorb pressure, he can apply it,\" said Root.\"He can whack you over your head for six. He can scoop you over his head for six. He can smack spin. He can smack seam.\"Root also made a century in Wellington, his 36th in Test cricket. Only four men in the history of the game have made more. In Pakistan, Root became England's leading run-scorer of all time.But the start of Brook's career has eclipsed that of his Yorkshire colleague. The 25-year-old has 2,280 runs in his 23 Tests. No England player has had more after the same number of games.Brook's average of 61.62 is the third highest in history of batters to have played at least 20 innings, behind the great Sir Don Bradman and his fellow Australian Adam Voges.Root has often been bracketed in the 'Fab Four' of Test batting, alongside Australia's Steve Smith, Kane Williamson of New Zealand and Indian Virat Kohli.Brook is in a new generation of run-scorers, including India opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sri Lankan Kamindu Mendis and New Zealand's Rachin Ravindra.\"Brookie is by far and away the best player in the world at the minute,\" said Root.Of Root, Brook said: \"I'm trying to catch him, but he's too good, isn't he? He's obviously one of the best players, if not the best players, to have ever played the game. It's mega to play with him and he's awesome to watch.\"England sealed the series with their 323-run win in Wellington. It is their first away series win in two years and first in New Zealand since 2008.Brook did not take the field as England completed victory on Sunday because of an ankle injury sustained playing football.He is not thought to be a doubt for the final Test of the series in Hamilton on Saturday (22:00 GMT, Friday).New Zealand have made a change to their squad, as opener Devon Conway misses for the birth of his first child.Will Young is likely to take his place in the side, with Mark Chapman called into the squad.",
