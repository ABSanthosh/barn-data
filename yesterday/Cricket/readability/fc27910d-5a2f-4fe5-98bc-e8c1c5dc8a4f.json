  "text": "Key events10m agoPope is not out!1h agoPreambleShow key events onlyPlease turn on JavaScript to use this feature32nd over: England 164-4 (Brook 75, Pope 44) Brook opens the face to steer Henry past second slip for four. Strokes like that must drive quality seam bowlers to distraction. I doubt crap seam bowlers enjoy them much either.Brook has 75 from 70 balls, a continuation of a statgasmic record in Tests in New Zealand. Brook has made 575 runs at an average of 115 with a strike rate of 102. And that includes being run out without facing a ball in the second innings on this ground two years ago.31st over: England 158-4 (Brook 70, Pope 43) Pope jabs at Smith and edges this far short of Latham at second slip. He gets the next ball away, back cutting efficiently to the fence.So, this medium-term No3, who should it be? Ben Stokes Technically suited but his brain whirs far too much in the field, even when he doesn’t bowl, so he needs a rest. Joe Root Doesn’t want to bat there, vulnerable to the new ball and especially extra bounce. Harry Brook Still too soon, especially in Australia with the extra bounce Ollie Pope Far better at No6 Jamie Smith Too soon even if he doesn’t keep wicket, never mind if he does. Jacob Bethell Too soon against India and Australia, plus he’s not in the best XI at the moment. I suspect Pope, who has always been a very selfless player, will return to No3 in the summer. I hope he doesn’t regret it. Maybe these performances will empower him if/when he does move back up.Pope is not out!30th over: England 154-4 (Brook 70, Pope 39) Pope survives, though it was closer than I thought: umpire’s call on the point of contact with both pad and stumps. He didn’t get far enough down the track to invalidate the appeal.New Zealand review for LBW against PopeHenry sees Brook coming and rams a bouncer past his face to tell him to stay in his crease. Brook does just that and pulls the next ball handsomely for six. This is so much fun.Pope, on the charge, survives a pretty big LBW appeal. I thought it was probably outside the line, and he was a long way down as well, but New Zealand have reviewed the decision.29th over: England 146-4 (Brook 63, Pope 39) Pope plays another gorgeous drive for four, this time through extra cover. England have got a problem on the horizon because he looks so good at No6; it’s not just the runs but the way he is scoring them. We haven’t heard the F-word* all series.Brook edges Smith just short of the slips and away for four. Enough of propping and cocking: he makes room to slam the next delivery over extra cover for a simply preposterous six. It’s his third of the innings, all over extra cover I think.* Frenetic28th over: England 130-4 (Brook 52, Pope 34) Matt Henry, who bowled a single spell of 7-4-14-2 this morning, returns after lunch and beats Brook with his first delivery. He’s had a Test career of two halves. His first 55 wickets cost 41 apiece, the last 57 have come at 19.He has an appeal for wicket No113 turned down when Pope flicks at a delivery down the leg side. A very good over ends with Brook playing and missing for the second time. Even in this very fine seam attack, Henry looks a class apart.27th over: England 128-4 (Brook 51, Pope 33) Smith has three slips waiting for an edge, though as you’d expect there’s nowhere near as much movement as there was with the new ball. Pope, who looks so much more natural at No6, rifles a lovely drive through mid-off for four.The players are back on the field. Harry Brook will resume on 51; Ollie Pope has 29. Nathan Smith, who has figures of 6-1-41-2 on day one of a Test match, has the ball.“Many thanks for your summary of the action we’ve missed,” says Nick Parish. “Mostly very informative, although I’m not convinced those of us who have followed this England team before really needed to be told that Zak Crawley went cheaply...”The more he fails, the more certain I am he’ll score 800 runs in next winter’s Ashes. I’m fascinated by good but not great players who produce their best against their best. Peter Willey and David Steele are good examples from the past. On an individual level, the New Zealand No3 Andrew Jones had outstanding head-to-head records against the best bowlers of his era.“Cricket though!” writes Adam Hirst. “What an amazing session that I almost saw. Soon Joe Root will oon not even be Yorkshire’s best batter. Whatever England manage in the rest of the day though, could get…* overshadowed by news from Adelaide.“*I don’t even like using the word ‘trumped’ any more.\"Toilet humour may never be the same again.PreambleHello and welcome to live, belated over-by-over coverage of the second Test between New Zealand and England in Wellington. As you may be aware, Guardian and Observer members of the National Union of Journalists have been on strike for the last 48 hours, hence the late start to our coverage. If you’d like to know more about that, click here.If you’re here for the cricket, the whole cricket and nothing but the cricket, here’s a summary of the morning session. England, put in by New Zealand, reached 124 for four from 26 overs at lunch They were 43 for 4 after Matt Henry and Nathan Smith took two wickets apiece Zak Crawley (17), Ben Duckett (0), Jacob Bethell (16) and Joe Root (3) all fell cheaply Harry Brook made a 48-ball fifty, with two sixes and five fours, and added 81 for the fifth wicket with Ollie Pope (29 not out) Full scorecard",
