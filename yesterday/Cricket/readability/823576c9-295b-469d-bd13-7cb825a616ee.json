In the second Test against West Indies in Grenada, Australia added 209 for five after resuming at a vulnerable 12 for two, taking their overall lead out to 254. The normality of the score is masked by the fact that several tropical rain delays kept play to 58.3 overs, so a full day’s play would likely have seen Australia bowled out and West Indies at least commencing the fourth innings.

The fact that John Campbell held the catch in a faulty cordon was a boost for West Indies, but Green and Smith tamped that back down. Green had the occasional problem, with an inside edge past the stumps or a sharply lifting ball, but produced the most convincing innings of his brief foray to No 3 in the batting order, moving to 52 with the occasional powerful cut shot, and otherwise a lot of forward defence and working the ball around.

Photograph: Randy Brooks/AFP/Getty ImagesBut at 121 for four, Travis Head walked out to crash his first ball through cover for four, and his free scoring seemed to ease some pressure on Smith. To that point Smith had looked more twitchy and unsure, playing conservatively but spasmodically trying an overly big shot that didn’t work with the variable bounce of this pitch, balls scooting under or jumping over the bat.With Head periodically smoking a drive, Smith’s aggressive shots came off, slotting Justin Greaves’ medium pace over mid on for four, and Roston Chase’s off spin over long off for six. Half century number 44 in his career came and went, but he couldn’t turn it into century number 37. It was shortly after tea, on 71, when Greaves got his own back, angling the ball in to smash pad, then bat, the on-field umpire ruling correctly.Australia have relied on Beau Webster of late, but Greaves got on a roll, drawing a hearty drive that Webster nicked to Chase for another successful slip catch. Head had a little flurry with fellow South Australian Alex Carey for seven overs, then was bowled for 39 by a ball angled in at the left-hander around the wicket. By that stage it was past the scheduled close, but two overs later, added time was ended when the umpires decided that the light was insufficient.
