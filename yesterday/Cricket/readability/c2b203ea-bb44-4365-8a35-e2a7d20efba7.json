He said the T20I tri-series would allow New Zealand to \"explore different players and combinations\", with the explosive Jacobs in line for a debut.\"Bevon's been an outstanding performer in domestic cricket and has gained some experience in franchise leagues around the world, so it'll be a good chance for him to get back into the squad and potentially play,\" he said.\"Adam's a really skilled T20 bowler, he's particularly proficient with the ball up front and brings that extra pace and bounce.

This series gives us the opportunity to test the breadth of our squad, explore different players and potentially different combinations against some quality opposition.\"New Zealand's first game in the tri-series is against South Africa in Harare on July 16, which is two days after the MLC final. NZC said that replacements would be named nearer the time if any members of the squad are involved in a clash and unable to arrive into Zimbabwe in time.After the T20Is, New Zealand will stay on for two Tests against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo.New Zealand Men's T20I squadMitch Santner (capt), Finn Allen, Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Jacob Duffy, Zak Foulkes, Matt Henry, Bevon Jacobs, Adam Milne, Daryl Mitchell, Will O'Rourke, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Tim Seifert, Ish Sodhi",
