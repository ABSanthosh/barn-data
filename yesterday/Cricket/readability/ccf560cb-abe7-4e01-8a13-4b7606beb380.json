  "text": "NewsThe left-arm spinner remains hopeful of playing the first Test less than two weeks after suffering the injury in the BBLAAP27-Jan-2025 • 28 mins agoMatt Kuhnemann admitted he briefly feared his thumb injury could have ended his hopes of touring Sri Lanka but both he and Steven Smith completed full training sessions on the squad's arrival in Galle for the Test series.Australia's premier left-arm spinner Kuhnemann is now pain-free after wearing a ball on his non-bowling hand playing for Brisbane Heat earlier this month. He reunited with the squad in Sri Lanka at the weekend and completed Sunday afternoon's first full session since arriving on the island for the two-match series.The questions Australia will need to answer in Sri LankaKuhnemann given all-clear to travel to Sri LankaUncapped Dinusha and Udara included in Sri Lanka squad for Australia Test seriesStand-in captain Smith, who suffered a minor elbow injury in the BBL, spent as much time batting in the nets as anyone else and did not appear hampered.Every team member attended the optional session, with conditions so humid that top-order option Sam Konstas removed his helmet to finish batting in the nets.Apparently in preparation for the turning conditions, allrounder Beau Webster bowled the right-arm offspin of earlier in his career rather than the medium pace trotted out on Test debut at the SCG earlier this month.Kuhnemann is continuing to wear a brace on his right thumb and medical staff will monitor him. His injury appeared more serious than Smith's, but Kuhnemann feels fit ahead of the first Test that begins on January 29.\"I had a couple of sessions back home and I was obviously cautious batting and fielding and everything but bowling, I haven't had a problem whatsoever,\" Kuhnemann said prior to the first training session. \"I did this same thumb a couple of years ago and it was real painful but this one has been fine from the get-go.\"As he awaited surgery, Kuhnemann said he was unsure whether he would have the chance to add to his three Test caps in Sri Lanka. The 28-year-old was a late call-up when Australia toured India in 2023, and the lack of subcontinent visits since had robbed him of further chances.\"Definitely there were times when I was disappointed. It's not great timing,\" Kuhnemann said when asked whether he feared for his ability to tour. \"There was a couple of hours. But I believe everything happens for a reason and you sort of move on. Obviously you do everything you can because these tours don't come around very often as a spinner.\"Kuhnemann could not attend the squad's preparatory camp at the ICC Academy in Dubai but managed a hit-out with a Cricket Australia XI against England Lions at Allan Border Field last week.\"The boys said I didn't miss out on too much and what I was bowling on back in Brisbane was an eight-day old wicket so it worked out pretty good,\" Kuhnemann said. \"If it was the off-season then maybe it would be a blow to miss Dubai but we're in the middle of summer and the workloads and confidence are high. Everything is all good.\"Get latest cricket updates on WhatsApp",
