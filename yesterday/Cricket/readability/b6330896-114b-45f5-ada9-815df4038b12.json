Devine will captain the side in the World Cup and a new ODI skipper will be appointed ahead of the home summer.Devine has been one of the world's premier allrounders over a stellar 19-year ODI career that began way back in 2006 when she debuted as a 17-year-old. She is second on New Zealand's all-time women's ODIs played list behind Suzie Bates and sits fourth on New Zealand's all-time women's ODI runscorers list but will almost certainly pass 4000 runs and move to third, ahead of Debbie Hockley, by the end of the World Cup. She also currently has eight ODI centuries, the second-most for New Zealand women behind Bates.She also currently sits second on New Zealand women's all-time ODI wicket-takers as one of only two players with more than 100 wickets alongside Lea Tahuhu.Devine is keen to continue playing T20I cricket but will only do so on a casual basis given she holds a number of franchise contracts overseas.\"It feels like the right time for me to start stepping away,\" Devine said. \"I feel very fortunate to have NZC's support in finding a solution that means I can still give to the White Ferns.\"It's important that everyone knows I'm focused and dedicated to giving this group everything I can before I step away.\"I'm really excited by where this young group's going and I'm looking forward to playing my part in the next six to nine months.\"Head of women's high performance Liz Green said Devine had NZC's full support in making this decision.\"Sophie's given nearly 20 years of service to the White Ferns and NZC is fully supportive of her quest to find more balance at this stage in her career,\" Green said. \"We're pleased to be able to reach an agreement that means she can continue to be involved with the White Ferns on a case-by-case basis, whilst opening up the opportunity for another player to be contracted in full.\"NZC chief executive Scott Weenink praised Devine's contribution to the White Ferns ODI team.\"Sophie has been an extraordinary leader and ambassador for the White Ferns,\" Weenink said. \"Supporting her move to a casual playing agreement will allow her to continue contributing to the White Ferns environment.\"Her legacy as one of the game's greatest allrounders and her commitment to nurturing the next generation makes this a positive step for both her and the White Ferns.\"Alex Malcolm is an associate editor at ESPNcricinfo",
