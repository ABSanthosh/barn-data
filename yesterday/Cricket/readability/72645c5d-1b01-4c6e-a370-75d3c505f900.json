  "text": "Kagiso Rabada has become the 39th man and sixth South African to take 300 Test wickets.He joined the greats of the game by taking three wickets on day one of the first Test against Bangladesh in Dhaka.And South African seamer's record stacks up well compared to the rest. Rabada has taken his 300th wicket in his 65th Test. That puts him joint-10th among all bowlers and joint-seventh among pace bowlers.But in terms of deliveries bowled to get to the landmark, Rabada is the quickest having taken 11,817 balls.That is 785 fewer than Pakistan great Waqar Younis. Rabada's fellow South Africa quicks Dale Steyn and Allan Donald are third and fourth on the list, having taken 12,605 and 13,672 balls in reaching 300 wickets respectively.Aged 29 years and 149 days, Rabada is also the eight-youngest player to take 300 Test wickets, with that record held by India all-rounder Kapil Dev.He reached 300 Test wickets in 1987, aged 27 years and 363 days.\"I was more focused on how we were going to win this Test, especially after losing the toss and bowling first,\" Rabada said afterwards.\"But when it happened, it was just a relief. Everyone plays for milestones, but it was a relief.\"It's a special moment. As for the record, I didn't know about it, but I guess it motivates me to do even better.\"",
