  "text": "NewsTwo spectators ejected from venue after reportedly chanting anti-Pakistan slogansKhushdil Shah had to be restrained from getting into an altercation with some spectators in Mount Maunganui  •  AFP via Getty ImagesAccording to a statement released by the PCB, the spectators were Afghanistan nationals shouting anti-Pakistan slogans. The incident came to light with a photograph that showed Khushdil - who wasn't playing the game - trying to go over the boundary rope after the end of the game to confront someone who wasn't pictured in the frame. He looked agitated, while security held him back, purportedly avoiding a more direct confrontation.A statement from the PCB management said it condemned \"the abusive language of foreign fans\". It said two Afghan spectators attempted to fight Khushdil after swearing at him in Pushto, a language spoken by people of Pakhtun heritage in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. The PCB said it had made a complaint, following which the spectators were ejected. The incident comes amid heightened political tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, whose recent cricketing contests have been laced with acrimony and spectator trouble.A statement from New Zealand Cricket confirmed to ESPNcricinfo that two spectators had been ejected \"following an altercation\" with Khushdil. \"The incident, which occurred after the game had finished, involved alleged abuse of Pakistan players in a foreign language, thought to be Pushto, and an angry reaction from Khushdil - who responded by confronting the pair,\" the statement said. \"Ground security prevented the incident escalating further and removed the offending spectators from the premises.\"Pakistan did not have a much happier time on-field, either, losing the third ODI by 43 runs to succumb to a 3-0 series defeat. It was Pakistan's sixth consecutive ODI defeat to New Zealand over the last two months, and caps a miserable tour of New Zealand following a disastrous Champions Trophy at home. New Zealand also won the preceding T20I series 4-1.Danyal Rasool is ESPNcricinfo's Pakistan correspondent. @Danny61000",
