  "text": "Watch: Jasprit Bumrah castled debutant Sam Konstas' stumps on the fourth morning of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne and followed it up with a similar celebration as Konstas' in the first innings. India added 11 runs to their overnight total to finish their first innings on 369 to finish 105 behind Australia's. The visitors gave the new ball to Akash Deep instead of Mohammed Siraj alongside Bumrah in the second innings and the pair created multiple chances. Bumrah generated plays-and-misses of almost every other delivery in his first spell, particularly off Usman Khawaja. Konstas, who had taken Bumrah down in the first innings in a never-seen-before assault, didn't try a single ramp shot in the second and was eventually cleaned up by a peach that seamed back in to go through his bat-pad gap and knock his stumps over for eight. Bumrah followed the dismissal with a celebration gesturing the crowd to make some noise, perhaps as a response to Konstas' similar act in the first innings. The debutant was seen egging the crowd on after smashing Bumrah for 18 runs in an over on day one. No words were spoken between the two, however. At the time of writing, Australia were 32-1 in 13 overs, their lead measuring 137.
