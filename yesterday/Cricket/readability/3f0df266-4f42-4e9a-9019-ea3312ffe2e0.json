  "text": "NewsHamstring injury leaves England looking at potential replacements ahead of Australia openerJacob Bethell faces a race for fitness after sustaining a hamstring injury  •  Getty ImagesEngland batter Jacob Bethell is set to miss the Champions Trophy after sustaining a left hamstring injury* on the tour of India. Bethell missed Sunday's second ODI in Cuttack, with England captain Jos Buttler saying afterwards he was unlikely to be fit for the tournament, which starts in 10 days' time.\"I'm pretty sure he's been ruled out of the Champions Trophy, to be honest,\" Buttler said. \"That's really disappointing for him, obviously he played nicely the other day and has been one of the really exciting players so it's a shame that the injury is going to rule him out.\"With Jamie Smith still recovering from a calf issue - the tourists were forced to name assistant coaches Marcus Trescothick and Paul Collingwood as sub-fielders in Cuttack - Somerset's Tom Banton has been drafted into the squad as cover, and will arrive in India on Monday.The extent of Bethell's injury will be established in the coming days, with England yet to make an official announcement about his status. England's Champions Trophy campaign kicks off on February 22, against Australia in Lahore, and there is optimism around Smith's recovery, with the wicketkeeper-batter taking part in the warm-ups on Sunday. The deadline for announcing replacements to the 15-man Champions Trophy squad is February 12.Bethell impressed with 51 and 1 for 18 with his left-arm spin in the first ODI against India, which the hosts won by four wickets. Having also performed well on his maiden Test tour of New Zealand at the end of 2024, with three half-centuries and an average of 52, he has been earmarked by head coach Brendon McCullum as a vital cog across all formats.Banton, meanwhile, has a chance to reignite his international career, having earned the last of his 20 white-ball caps in 2022. Though he has underwhelmed for England so far, with just three fifty-plus scores across four ODIs and 16 T20Is, he is in a rich vein of form off the back of a stellar ILT20, topping the competition's batting charts.The 26-year-old struck 493 runs in 11 outings for MI Emirates, including two centuries, as the franchise reached the Eliminator stage where they were defeated by Sharjah Warriors.1900 GMT - This story was updated with Jos Buttler's post-match quotes",
