Only a final-wicket partnership of 13 between Adam Zampa and Tanveer Sangha ensured Australia reached three figures.It was Australia's heaviest defeat against Sri Lanka in terms of runs and their fifth-heaviest against any opposition.Kusal Mendis hit 101 from 115 runs and Charith Asalanka 78 not out from 66 in Sri Lanka's 281-4.\"We have been outplayed but used a lot of players and got a lot out of it,\" said Smith, who is standing in as skipper for injured bowler Pat Cummins.\"It was a fine bowling performance by Sri Lanka and not a great batting performance.\"We will keep moving forward. Credit to Sri Lanka.\"Australia's build-up for the Champions Trophy has been hit by injuries to Cummins, bowler Josh Hazlewood and all-rounder Mitchell Marsh, plus Marcus Stoinis' retirement and Mitchell Starc opting to miss the tournament.Their first match is against England, who go into the match on the back of their 3-0 series defeat by India, on 22 February.South Africa and Afghanistan are also in the four-team group.",
