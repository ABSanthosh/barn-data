  "text": "Nathan McSweeney will open the batting for Australia in the first Test against India in Perth having won the race to partner Usman Khawaja while Josh Inglis has been included as the reserve batter in a 13-player squad.McSweeney had firmed as the favourite for the vacant role in recent weeks and though he couldn't convert two starts against India A at the MCG - where he made 14 and 25 on a tricky pitch opening for the first time his first-class career - he has been preferred ahead of specialist openers including Marcus Harris who does not even make the squad.'A right-handed version of Warner': Josh Inglis launched into opening debateBatting issues loom over Australia with big five in focus\"I've been able to perform pretty consistently over the past couple of years in Shield cricket. I feel like my game is constantly getting better and improving,\" McSweeney said. \"I feel like I'm playing probably the best cricket I have. It's nice to spend some time in the middle against India A in Mackay and here at the MCG and feel like my game's ready.\"McSweeney was only given the word by national selector George Bailey after the end of the second A game at the MCG. \"There's been a lot of talk about it, didn't really know until I finally got the word, still probably hasn't quite sunk in yet,\" he said. \"Getting a lot of nice messages. Very lucky and grateful for the opportunity.\"Despite just one match at the top of the order, there is confidence McSweeney is ready for the role. \"I don't think it's a huge adjustment to go from three to opening,\" Bailey said.For McSweeney, very little changes. \"Other than walk out one position earlier than I normally do, my prep is the exact same,\" he said. \"I trained with the new ball batting at three, and you can be in there in the first over of the game.\"As expected, Scott Boland takes his place as the back-up quick bowler behind captain Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood for the first Test at Optus Stadium which begins on November 22.The decisions taken by the selectors follows their recent mantra of picking the best six batters rather than focusing too heavily on the positions they traditionally occupy. The vacancy at the top of the order arose after the decision to move Steven Smith back to No. 4 following his four-Test stay earlier this year after the retirement of David Warner.\"Nathan has displayed the attributes we believe will equip him well for Test cricket along with a strong recent record in domestic cricket,\" Bailey. \"His performances for South Australia and Australia A weighed in his favour and supports our view he is ready for the opportunity at Test level.\"Similarly, Josh has been in great touch in the Sheffield Shield competition and deserves his place in his first Test squad. Scott has been a top-level performer when given the opportunity at Test level and remains a valued member of the squad. The squad is balanced and provides Andrew and Pat the options required for what shapes as a captivating series.\"Overall in first-class cricket McSweeney averages 38.16 with six centuries in 34 matches but over the last two years that average rises to 43.44 with all his hundreds coming during that period. In a sign of his standing among the selectors he was handed Australia A captaincy before he led his state, South Australia.Harris looked to have made a strong case for selection with a hard-fought 74 in the first innings against India A in Melbourne but it wasn't enough to return him to the Test fold. Sam Konstas sealed victory in the match with a fine innings at No. 4 but after early-season excitement with his twin hundreds against South Australia it has been decided it is a little too early for the 19-year-old. Cameron Bancroft's horror run of form meant he drifted well out of contention but Bailey insisted he and Harris remained in the selectors' thoughts.\"It's a tough one because whenever the information is first given it potentially feels hollow that they've been overlooked again,\" Bailey said. \"But as I said its just to be really clear to them that not being selected is not us saying that we don't think you aren't a good player, we just have to make a decision on who is going to fit the role best and at the moment we think that's Nathan.\"Inglis' selection is something of a left-field decision but rewards him for being one of the most in-form players this season with two Sheffield Shield hundreds. His credentials were lauded by New South Wales Greg Shipperd last month who said he should be in contention to open. Bailey played that down but did say he could play a role this season and that opportunity is now a step closer. He also provides wicketkeeping back-up for Alex Carey.Inglis will captain Australia for the first time later on Sunday in the deciding ODI against Pakistan and then in the three-match T20I series meaning he will link up with the Test squad after those matches are complete.Australia squad for 1st Test vs IndiaPat Cummins (capt), Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Nathan McSweeney, Steven Smith, Mitchell Starc",
