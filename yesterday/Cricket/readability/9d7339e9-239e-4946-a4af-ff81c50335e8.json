  "text": "NewsParth Jindal's request came after the IPL relocated the May 23 match between RCB and SRH from Bengaluru to Lucknow because of \"unfavourable weather conditions\"A loss on Wednesday would knock Delhi Capitals out of the race to the playoffs  •  Associated PressLooking at the possibility of a washout, or serious interruptions, in the high-stakes IPL 2025 contest between Mumbai Indians (MI) and Delhi Capitals (DC) on Wednesday night in Mumbai, DC co-owner Parth Jindal has requested the IPL to move the match to another city.If MI win on Wednesday, they are through to the playoffs; if DC win, neither team is through, and the fight for that final playoffs spot goes into their final league games - both of them have a game against Punjab Kings (PBKS) left after this one. In an email, accessed by ESPNcricinfo, to the IPL on Tuesday, Jindal pointed out that the \"virtual quarter final is also expected to be washed out\".In case of a washout, the teams will split points, taking MI to 15 and DC to 14 ahead of their final fixtures.On Tuesday, the Indian met department issued a yellow alert (the second of four levels) for Mumbai for the next four days.Jindal said it would be \"consistent\" then to move the MI-DC match, too.\"The forecast in Mumbai is for heavy rains and there is a strong likelihood that the game will be washed out,\" he wrote. \"Just as the game between RCB vs SRH has been moved out of Bengaluru in the quest for consistency and in the interest of the league it is my request that tomorrow's game also be moved to a different location as we have known for the better part of 6 days that the forecast for 21st in Mumbai is for heavy showers.\"The development came close on the heels of Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) chief executive Venky Mysore writing to the IPL to say that the defending champions were \"aggrieved\" that the new rain rule - an additional 120 minutes to complete games in case of rain - hadn't been in place at the time of the restart of the IPL. On May 17, in the first game after the IPL resumed, the RCB vs KKR game in Bengaluru was washed out, ending KKR's chances of making the playoffs.Nagraj Gollapudi is news editor at ESPNcricinfoGet latest cricket updates on WhatsApp",
