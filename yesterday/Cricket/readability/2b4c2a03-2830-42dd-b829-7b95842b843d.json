He scored a century for the Under-19s in Australia last winterEngland have named all-rounder Jacob Bethell in their squad for the three-Test series in New Zealand.The 21-year-old Warwickshire player made his international debut in the summer, playing two T20s and five one-day internationals against Australia, but this is his first call-up to the Test squad.Wicketkeeper Jamie Smith will miss the series to be at the birth of his first child.Jordan Cox is set to deputise and make his Test debut, with left-hander Bethell adding additional batting depth.Vice-captain Ollie Pope keeps his place in the squad despite a difficult tour of Pakistan in which he averaged just 11, with a highest score of 29, across the three Tests.England also include three frontline spinners in Shoaib Bashir, Jack Leach and Rehan Ahmed. England squad for Test series against New Zealand: Ben Stokes (captain), Rehan Ahmed, Gus Atkinson, Shoaib Bashir, Jacob Bethell, Harry Brook, Bryson Carse, Jordan Cox, Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Jack Leach, Ollie Pope, Matthew Potts, Joe Root, Olly Stone, Chris Woakes.Bethell's inclusion is the clear standout given he has only played 20 first-class matches since making his debut for Warwickshire in 2021.A batting average of 25.44 with no centuries and only five fifties in red-ball cricket is also likely to draw scepticism at his selection.But the Barbados-born batting all-rounder is undoubtedly a talented player and has made his name in the shorter formats.He starred for Birmingham Phoenix in The Hundred and also hit four half-centuries for Birmingham Bears in the Vitality Blast this summer before showing glimpses of his ability in his first white-ball series for England.The series in New Zealand is England's last in the current World Test Championship cycle, although Ben Stokes' side cannot qualify for the final.The first Test in Christchurch begins on 27 November with matches in Wellington and Hamilton to follow in December.As England finalise plans, so too are New Zealand.It has been confirmed key batter Kane Williamson will not join the Kiwis for the third Test against India, which starts in Mumbai on Friday, as they take a \"cautious approach\" to his return from a groin injury with the England series in mind.\"Kane continues to show good signs but isn't quite ready to jump on a plane and join us,\" said New Zealand head coach Gary Stead.\"While things are looking promising, we think the best course of action is for him to stay in New Zealand and focus on the final part of his rehabilitation so he'll be good to go for England.\"England's batting now looking curious - analysisBy Stephan Shemilt, BBC Chief Cricket WriterThis was an unusual situation for England. Going back to Jonny Bairstow, Ben Foakes, Dan Lawrence or Alex Lees would have raised eyebrows, as would uncapped options like Ben McKinney and James Rew.They have settled on another hunch in Bethell, who is clearly talented but so inexperienced and with no real body of work in professional cricket.For all the talk of building a battery of fast bowlers, the batting is now looking curious: Ollie Pope is out of form, Ben Stokes is feeling his way back and Jordan Cox will get a debut in New Zealand.Now, the next man in line does not have a first-class hundred. If England are building to the Ashes, it is worth remembering their only series win in Australia in the past 30-plus years was built on a stack of runs.Not everything is about the Ashes, either.In the heavy loss in the deciding Test in Pakistan, England drifted in the field. A team of young, unflappable characters is a positive, but sometimes you need players to take the game by the scruff of the neck.Bairstow, Stuart Broad, James Anderson and Ollie Robinson would be happy to get in a battle. Without them, Stokes has looked short of a few fighters.It is admirable that Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum are revamping the age profile of the England squad, and county cricket is very different to the international game so picking on attributes rather than record has merits.Still, there is a nagging doubt England may have a few too many boys and not enough men.New Zealand v England schedule and fixtures22-23 November: New Zealand Cricket XI v England XI, Sir John Davies Oval, Queenstown (22:00 GMT)27 November-1 December: First Test, Hagley Oval, Christchurch (22:00 GMT5-9 December: Second Test, Basin Reserve, Wellington (22:00 GMT)13-17 December: Third Test, Seddon Park, Hamilton (22:00 GMT)More on this story",
