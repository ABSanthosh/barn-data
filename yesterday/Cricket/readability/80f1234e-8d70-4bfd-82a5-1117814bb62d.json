He is the one that’s going to do all the talking for India, and why so much focus was on him in the buildup to this Test match, and whether he would be fit.”On Monday Guha issued an on-air apology before the start of play at the Gabba. “Yesterday in commentary I used a word that can be interpreted in a number of different ways,” she said.“Firstly, I’d like to apologise for any offence caused. I set myself really high standards when it comes to empathy and respect for others and if you listen to the full transcript I only meant the highest praise for one of India’s greatest players and someone that I admire greatly as well.“I am an advocate for equality and someone who has spent their career thinking about inclusion and understanding in the game. I am trying to frame the enormity of his achievements and I have chosen the wrong word and for that I am deeply sorry.“As someone who is also … of South Asian heritage, I hope people would recognise there was no other intention or malice there. I hope this doesn’t overshadow what has been a great Test match so far and I look forward to seeing how it progresses. Once again, I am really, really sorry.”Guha’s colleague and Indian cricketing great Ravi Shastri praised her for addressing the matter and said India were happy to move on.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“Brave woman, to do it on live television and apologise,” Shastri said. “It takes some steel. You heard it from the horse’s mouth.“As far as I’m concerned, game over. People are entitled to make mistakes. We are all human. To own up and say, ‘I’m sorry’ … it takes courage. She’s done it.
