With a 295-run win at Perth, India took an early lead in the long-awaited five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy as Jasprit Bumrah claimed 5-30 and 3-42, and Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli hit hundreds. However, Australia hit back with a 10-wicket triumph in the day-night Test match at Adelaide. For them, Mitchell Starc had 6-48 and 2-60 and Pat Cummins 2-41 and 5-57, while Travis Head hit 140 off only 141 balls. The teams are now in Brisbane for the third Test match, to begin from December 14. After missing out at Adelaide, Josh Hazlewood is now fit and will return to the XI in place of Scott Boland. The weather, however, looks gloomy a day ahead of the Test match. While the situation is not entirely bleak (it is worth noting that there has been only one drawn Test in 2024 so far), the first day is almost certain to be hit by rain. 33 balls into the first innings when Australia were batting, a slight drizzle, which turned heavier later, forced the first interruption of the day. Weather predictions for day 1, Brisbane Test match Updated 1.50 PM Indian Standard Time, December 13 “Cloudy and humid with a couple of thunderstorms around,” runs the AccuWeather prediction for the first day. The probability of precipitation is as high as 88 per cent, while there is a 53 per cent chance of thunderstorms. BBC Weather presents a similar picture. There is an 80 per cent chance of rainfall at 10 AM local time. The probability drops to the thirties before reverting to 80 per cent by one in the afternoon, and continues to be around that mark until three before dropping to the thirties again. Weather.com predicts an 84 per cent chance of rain on Saturday and 73 per cent on Sunday, the second day of the Test match.
