In the National Cricket League 2024/25 match between Dhaka Metropolis and Rangpur Division, wicketkeeper Tahjibul Islam lost his wicket off a Mehedi Hasan delivery in unexpected fashion. Batting at No.3, Tahjibul attempted to drive the delivery, but a part of his bat came off. Rather dramatically, it flew behind and cleaned up his stumps. The batter stood as the fielding team celebrated, staring at the toe end of his bat, a part of which was now resting next to the stumps. He did not budge until the fielders walked up to him, bringing him out of his trance. One of them picked up the piece and handed him back to Tahjibul, who had to solemnly walk back, still not able to come to terms with his luck. He was the second-highest run-scorer for the Metropolis in the first innings, scoring 73 off 190. The match ended in a draw, despite Metropolis being dismissed for 118 in the second innings.
