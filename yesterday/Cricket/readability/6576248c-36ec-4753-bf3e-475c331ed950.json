With his tiptoeing, tightrope approach and tightly knit hands, he made the ball spit like an overheated wok against Somerset. In his first over he hit Sean Dickson on the hand, who retired hurt, and later removed a softened-up Archie Vaughan, did James Rew for pace and greeted Kasey Aldridge with a missile at his neck. Jordan Clark, all muscle to Atkinson’s venom, did most of the rest, picking up five wickets, including two in two balls. Some oomplah from Lewis Gregory took Somerset to a first batting point and beyond.A series of injuries had left Durham looking behind the fridge for fast bowlers. But their makeshift seam attack made mincemeat of Worcestershire, who were whistled out for 162. Jake Ball, arriving on a two-match loan from Somerset, celebrated with five for 47, while quickfire South African Codi Yusuf (signed on the recommendation of David Bedingham) ran in at full pelt, picked up two wickets, and worried a few more. Durham then lost four quick wickets of their own.Josh Tongue fizzed like magnesium at Trent Bridge. Regularly hitting the high 80s, with a gravelly yorker, he pocketed five wickets, three of them in one over, as Sussex were dismissed for 169. It was his second five-fer of the season; Brett Hutton grabbed four for 53. Captain Haseeb Hameed ticked along to 67 not out in Nottinghamshire’s reply.There was another hulking England hopeful in action at Bristol, where Leicestershire’s Josh Hull pinned big Cameron Green lbw, but Gloucestershire were mainly undone by five wickets from Ben Green, another Somerset loanee. James Bracey’s unbeaten 93 took Leicestershire past 250, before Gloucestershire encountered batting problems of their own.David Lloyd (93) and Harry Came (73) ensured that Derbyshire had a relatively serene day against Middlesex.A very lively last half hour at The Oval, well played Lewis Gregory to haul Somerset to a batting point and beyond. Some cracking bowling too from Gus Atkinson and Jordan Clark. Thanks for all your messages, that’s it from us for today – we’ll be back tomorrow. Bye!Close of play scoresDIVISION ONETrent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 164-3 v Sussex 169The Oval: Surrey v Somerset 283-9New Road: Worcestershire 162 v Durham 55-4DIVISION TWODerby: Derbyshire 267-5 v MiddlesexBristol: Gloucestershire 252 v Leicestershire 91-4Some amusing, and clever, heave-ho by Lewis Gregory and the injured Sean Dickson for the last wicket is deeply frustrating Surrey.And as Ben Duckett has a huge flash and gets caught behind, time for me to write up for early deadlines on a Friday. Do chat on BTL.Aldridge and Gregory have resorted dead bats and indifference as a go-slow settles over The Oval.Ali MartinFive wickets for Jake Ball here at New Road, Jacob Duffy driving and ultimately edging into the slips cordon where George “Lethal” Drissell held on at the second attempt. Ball let out a huge “come on” before being swarmed by his new team-mates. A sweet moment for an experienced bowler who has slid down the pecking order at Somerset and it sees Worcestershire 162 all out. Time for a look at Ben McKinnie, the Durham opener who would be as tall as the floodlights if the ground had any.Ali MartinEthan Brookes was looking to roll over his golden form from last week’s breathtaking near-miss at Chelmsford, driving Worcestershire past the 150-mark, eight wickets down, with a couple of sweetly struck boundaries. But an attempt to propel Jake Ball through the cathedral window has just caused his downfall, a top edge and a smart catch at long leg giving Durham’s loan ranger his fourth of the innings. Worcestershire 156 for nine.Tea-time scoresDIVISION ONETrent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 28-0 v Sussex 169The Oval: Surrey v Somerset 164-5New Road: Worcestershire 143-8 v DurhamDIVISION TWODerby: Derbyshire 173-2 v MiddlesexBristol: Gloucestershire 250-9 v LeicestershireAldridge jerks his head out of the way – another slippery delivery from Atkinson, straight at the neck.A satisfying south London roar as James Rew is done for pace by Gus Atkinson.In Division Two, everything in Derbyshire’s garden continues to be lovely. David Lloyd moves into the 90s, Harry Came the 50s. Derby 161-1.And some boundary biffing by Josh Shaw has taken Gloucestershire to the heady heights o 208-8, Bracey 61 not out.And as I press send, Tom Lammonby loses his stumps, for 76. Somerset 152-4.Five wickets for Josh TongueAround the grounds, as Jordan Clark delivers hot potatoes.Sussex have been Hutton-Tongued – all out for 169. Tongue 5-44, Hutton 4-54.

First went Henry Nicholls, his fighting knock halted on 40 lbw by a ball that nipped in, then Matthew Waite flashing uppishly to backward point for eight. Yusuf was whistled up from South Africa at very short notice on the recommendation of David Bedingham and is here on a two-month deal as cover, fresh from playing in the final of the four-day competition over there. Worcestershire 116 for six on what is a very sluggish outfield.An edge, a seven-league boot leap for Jordan Clark, and Tom Banton is caught behind from a beauty. A few minutes later, Surrey go up again in unison, but this time no cigar. Somerset 149-3.Tom Banton looking dejected after getting caught out for 26. Photograph: Keeran Marquis/SPP/ShutterstockThe slips are in jumpers now at The Oval – as Lammonby digs out a yorker from Jordan Clark. Rory Burns, in instantly identifiable sunhat, is busy at mid off. From folded arms and sunglassed stare, to ball polishing energy. Lammonby ticks over to 72, Banton has passed the 20 barrier.County Cricket Day 2025Some cracking work by the people behind County Cricket day. The idea- to get as many people as possible to attend a county cricket game - is being supported by the ECB this year. Men’s CC day 2o25 falls on Sunday June 29, Women’s CC day on Sunday July 6.TWO BITS OF EXCITING NEWS Number 1: We've already said that County Cricket Day will be taking place on Sun 29 June, but we're very excited to announce… WE'LL BE ADDING A WOMEN'S COUNTY CRICKET DAY ON SUNDAY 6 JULY 2025 #CountyCricketDay— County Cricket Day (@ccricketday) April 24, 2025A recovery of sorts at Bristol, at the hands of that man Bracey (44 not out). Zaman Akhter has just been a third wicket for Green, on loan from Somerset for the first seven rounds of the season.Andy Bull’s cracking piece on cricket in America, an extract from Wisden.I haven’t seen this but have heard that it is not for the faint-hearted.Ali MartinAn early wicket after lunch here at New Road, Ben Raine getting his first of the day as he traps Adam Hose in front. Nipped in a fraction from a fullish length and struck below the knee roll. Decent fightback before the interval by Hose and new recruit Hairy Knuckles Henry Nicholls but Worcestershire are 77 for four as the familiar figure of Brett D’Oliveira scampers out to the middle.Easy, captain: a trotting Haseeb Hameed collects James Coles for 37. A second wicket for Tongue. Sussex 108 for five.Here at The Oval, Tom Lammonby has fifty and Tom Banton has joined him to disprove his feast or famine season. Somerset 107 for two.Another wicket at The Oval, Tom Abell, caught behind, daydreaming. Worrall the man. Somerset 100-2.Thanks to Yas Rana for tipping me off about this – New Zealand cricket have invested in Major League cricket. They are going to to be joint partners in a new franchise, investing as a way of “diversifying their income” . It is the first time an ICC member has invested in a franchise in this way.New Zealand chief exec Scott Weenink:“As franchise cricket grows globally, NZC needs to adapt to seize strategic opportunities that ensure the sustainability of our cricket network.“This helps diversify our revenue streams, expands our global brand and fan base, and creates new talent development and retention pathways for both our players and coaches.”Surrey cap Gus AtkinsonAtkinson, just capped, runs in, arms squeezed , tip-toeing – and there’s the wicket! Vaughan caught behind for 36. A dabble too many. Somerset 98-1.A large plate of spicy beans and potato wedges later, and the sun has disappeared and Dan Worrall has the ball once more.Ian Holland already has a post-lunch wicket as the Gloucestershire melt continues at Bristol: 94-7.

Lawrence rubs the ball on his shirt and Lammonby edges past the gap at slip and down to the rope. Off they stroll, Somerset’s morning: 87 for 0. Lunch scores to follow as the pigeons settle and the groundsman walk on with their wheelbarrow.Gloucestershire are now 85 for six, a couple of wickets for the lesser-known Green – Ben. Bracey prepares for another rebuild.In the other Division Two game, Lloyd and Came have had a productive morning at the County Ground, the one wicket to fall: Jewell caught off TRJ. Derbys 80 for one.So many familar faces popping in here at The Oval, cricket journalists using it as their base to work from.As lunch approaches, an aperitif:Josh Hull strikes Ashes blow!Big Josh Hull traps Big Cameron Green. All that beasting that he talked about to Ali paying dividends.Ali MartinWorcestershire could have been forgiven for being quietly chuffed that England were resting Matthew Potts for this one, worsening something of an injury crisis for Durham’s seam stable. Jake Ball has arrived on loan and nipped out three early wickets, however, and now Codi Yusuf, a South African right-armer who absolutely sprints in, is testing out the Pears with some slippery stuff, pace-wise. A quick google tells me Allan Donald has previously flagged him up as one to keep an eye out for. High praise indeed.Lots of appeals by Surrey, but Somerset have had a perky first hour and twenty minutes. Vaughan looking the real deal. A generous couple of handful of spectators now in their seats, crowding the pavilion and scattered around the stands.Don’t mess with this woman! Great portrait and fantastic to think of her looking down on everyone in the Long Room.The new portrait of Charlotte Edwards is unveiled in the Long Room at Lord’s.Edwards says that artist Hero Johnson has “captured everything about me”. pic.twitter.com/7CQvP0ODr8— Raf Nicholson (@RafNicholson) April 24, 2025 A drop! (tactfully not shown on The Oval replay screen). Lawrence at third slip. Vaughan moves serenely on. Burns moves his slips, closer, no further apart, no closer again. Sibley, now slimline, Ollie Pope, an ageless figure who would slide seamlessly int a 1930s or 1970s team photo, and long -limbed fidget Dan Lawrence. Somerset 42-0.Gloucestershire are having a sub-prime morning– oh thats a peachy drive for four by Archie Vaughan off Jordan Clark, and there’s another four, squarer, next ball – at Bristol. Van Beek and Holland – who caused so much chaos at Old Trafford on Sunday evening – have cut through the Glos top order too: Bancroft, Charlesworth and Ollie Price all gone. Glos: 21 for three v Leicestershire.Big, bad Fergus O’Neill is pounding in at Trent Bridge, but once again it is Brett Hutton who slides into the wickets column. Haines for a duck, Clark for 8. Sussex a dismal 16-2. Notts, promoted to Division One at the end of 2022, finished 6th in 2023, 8th in 2024 – feels like this could be a happier summer.Ali MartinA wicket here at New Road. Gareth Roderick had just survived a drop at slip, pushing forward, only to then slash an edge behind two balls later and throw his head back in disgust. Jake Ball, on loan for Somerset and a little wayward initially, gets his first wicket as a Durham bowler and the hosts are seven for one in the eighth over. We weren’t sure how this pitch would play after five floods and 39 days spent underwater during the winter. Not sure it was at fault for that dismissal however.Jake Ball of Durham celebrates with teammates after taking the wicket of Rob Jones. Photograph: Dan Istitene/Getty ImagesEarly drama here at The Oval, where Sean Dickson has retired hurt after being rapped on the hand by Gus Atkinson. Lammonby joins Vaughan. Mornin’ Tanya! Hello there, Tim Maitland! ”It’s far too soon to dismiss the title pretensions of last season’s 1st versus last season’s 3rd at The Oval, at least mathematically, but given that between them they’ve managed five draws and a loss between them in 2025 they are both in dire need of something this week aren’t they? ”The only reason they’re not out of it is that no-one’s managed more than one win in their three starts. ”It really has been a strange start to the season hasn’t it? Especially when you consider that the weather wasn’t getting in the way.”I know I sound like such a fan girl but doing a lap of The Oval is a heart-warming experience. People stream through the gate, the sun is shining, the coffee is good and as the ground announcer said the names of the openers, I saw one young man walking to the gate quicken his step and tell his friend “Yes! Archie Vaughan is playing.”Ali MartinGood morning from New Road, where the sun is (in and) out for Worcestershire’s first home fixture of the season against Durham. Things are tinged with a touch of sadness here after the recent passing of club journalist and former Press Association writer John Curtis.JC was among the very best people on the circuit: knowledgeable, generous and just so incredibly welcoming to anyone who walked into the press box. One of the members has just passed me some flowers to pop in JC’s usual spot, where he would spend a day’s play cracking jokes and swapping stories. As the BBC’s Martin Emmerson quipped just now, the minute’s silence planned before the start of play could scarcely be less appropriate (or more deserved). For further reading, there is a lovely tribute on the Worcestershire website here too. Cheers, JC.I’m sitting next to the Wisden editor, who allowed me to touch (once) Jamie Smith’s embossed Cricketer of The Year 2025 edition before it was handed over. Lovely end papers.Any questions for Lawrence?

Let’s just say that they haven’t won at The Oval since 1995 and haven’t won an away game in two years.Limping Durham have been desperately leafing through the address book. In come three pace bowlers: South African Codi Yusuf ( signing for six games) plus Jake Ball (Somerset) and Jack Blatherwick (Lancs)on loan for the next two games.FixturesDIVISION ONETrent Bridge: Nottinghamshire v SussexThe Oval: Surrey v SomersetNew Road: Worcestershire v DurhamDIVISION TWODerby: Derbyshire v MiddlesexBristol: Gloucestershire v LeicestershirePreambleGood morning!
