And how does the ICC future-proof cricket? Henry Moeran is alongside former Ashes winner Steven Finn and Test Match Special’s Nikesh Rughani to discuss all that. They look at the alternative options to open for England instead of Zak Crawley, as well as the reasons why Sam Cook has been linked to a call-up for the national side.

    "description": "Simon Hughes and Simon Mann are joined by Daily Telegraph cricket writer and author Tim Wigmore to discuss the backstory, the current state and the future prosperity of the Test format as examined in Tim's new book Test Cricket: A History. The conversation ranges from the origins of the Test match idea, with just three countries involved, how it expanded, chronicling key matches, turning points and characters, how the great 1970s West Indies and 1990s Australia were formed, and why Australia are consistently so much better than everyone else. Finally we consider if India can dominate in the same way and how the Test format can survive and prosper.
