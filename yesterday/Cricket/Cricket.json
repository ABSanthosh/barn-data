For the batting lineup, the answer is not always clear‚Äú‚ÄòIt‚Äôs about mindset,‚Äù Brendon McCullum said, early on Saturday afternoon, while Pakistan‚Äôs players were still celebrating on the outfield with their trophy and their fans. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about getting players who feel 10ft tall and bulletproof when they go out to play.

These guys are able to play the game a lot better than perhaps we could ourselves.‚ÄùIt is safe to say that none of his players felt 10ft tall at the time, having over the last two games of the series taken it in turns to be reduced to rubble by the spin of Sajid Khan and Noman Ali, and by the batting of Kamran Ghulam and Saud Shakeel.
