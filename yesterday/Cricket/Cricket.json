Following their humiliation, the WIndies cricket board called an emergency meeting but what will that do to help turn around their fortunes? The team discuss what's next for Test cricket in the Caribbean.Plus, in 2013, Puja Pabari, who had never followed cricket and didn’t understand the game, married India batter Cheteshwar Pujara and witnessed firsthand what happens in an international cricketer’s daily life. They both join us, as we pull back the curtain and find out what life is really like for the spouse of an elite cricketer.Photo: Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster, Cameron Green and Sam Konstas of Australia celebrate the dismissal of Jayden Seales of West Indies during the third day of the third Test cricket match between West Indies and Australia at Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica, on July 14, 2025.

Former England men’s spinner and current England men’s U19s Head Coach, Michael Yardy, tells Stumped the future of English cricket is in good hands as his side prepare to face their Indian counterparts in a two-match Test series. He also gives us his take on India’s 14-year-old batting sensation, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, who’s been the standout player for the tourists so far. And, we debate whether South Africa’s stand-in captain Wiann Mulder did the right thing declaring himself just 33 runs short of Brian Lara's record for the highest individual score in a Test innings.Photo: Richa Ghosh and Jemimah Rodrigues of India celebrate hitting the winning runs following the 4th Women's Vitality IT20 match between England and India at Emirates Old Trafford on July 09, 2025 in Manchester, England.
