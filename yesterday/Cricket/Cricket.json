    "description": "The teenage prodigy who scooped his way into national consciousness on Boxing Day has a lot to prove on Australiaâ€™s upcoming tour and beyondIf youâ€™re Sam Konstas, youâ€™re used to things moving quickly. It took 718 first-class runs to get into the Australian team. It took 113 Test runs to potentially change the way it is set up. For almost two years since Travis Head won a shootout in India, the plan has been clear: on the next ragging Asian pitch, the usual No 5 would skip up the order, opening the batting to target rare overs of seam or to smack spinners using a harder ball. Usman Khawaja would partner him with graft, the veteran regular opener bridging the gap after David Warnerâ€™s retirement.A few weeks before Australiaâ€™s imminent series in Sri Lanka, though, that plan was turned upside down. Konstas is also an opener. Konstas is also in the squad. On the momentum of the moment, Konstas is going to play. So either Khawaja moves down the order for the first time in years, Konstas plays out of position in his third Test, or Australia abandon the Head plan that has sat there for so long waiting to be implemented. However it goes will mean a major last-minute change on the basis of a Test career that reads 60, 8, 23, 22. Continue reading...",

With India requiring 40 from 30, but with three wickets in hand, the match was turning towards the visitors. With Jofra Archerâ€™s heat to take in once again, Varma had much to do.

    "description": "Alison Mitchell, Jim Maxwell and Charu Sharma are joined by Zimbabweâ€™s first black cricketer, Henry Olonga, as we ask whether boycotts work in cricket?Itâ€™s in light of political pressure on England and South Africa to pull out of their matches against Afghanistanâ€™s men at next month's ICC Champions Trophy. It's due to the Taliban regime's oppression of women, which includes a ban on playing sport. Olonga, alongside Andy Flower, took a stand against Robert Mugabeâ€™s regime by wearing a black armband in the 2003 World Cup game against Namibia. It was to symbolise \"the death of democracy\" in the country. Henry's been living in exile from Zimbabwe ever since and told the programme the current situation has echoes of 2003 and that the International Cricket Council and international Governments should be the ones making the decision not to play, rather than the players. We also talk to Australia Ashes winner now commentator, Mel Jones, on the role she played on getting many of those women out of the country when the Taliban returned to power in 2021. Melâ€™s also been involved in organising the teamâ€™s exhibition match which will be played ahead of the opening day of the Womenâ€™s Ashes Test in Melbourne later this month.Photo: Groundmen hold a large national flag of Afghanistan on the eve of the 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup one-day international (ODI) match between India and Afghanistan at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi on October 10, 2023.
