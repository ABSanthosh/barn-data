    "description": "My friend Michael Burns, who has died aged 87, leaves a significant legacy as a cricket historian, both as film-maker and author. Cricket was central to his life – whether playing for many years for Malden Wanderers or coaching Surrey youth teams or being an often sceptical MCC member – and he had a deep understanding of the game, usually but not always transcending partisanship.His films included histories of Surrey and Yorkshire, reviews of individual seasons, accounts of English tours of the 1950s, and a particularly evocative portrait of English cricket in the 60s. His three books culminated in Seven Summers (2022), the definitive story of how Surrey in the 50s reeled off a record seven consecutive county championship triumphs. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Legendary Lancashire seamer dies aged 84Hard worker played in 17 Tests for EnglandPeter Lever’s life changed one day in the nets at Todmorden, his local cricket club. He was in the team as a batter who kept wicket, and bowled the occasional off-break. Trinidad’s Sylvester Oliver, the club’s professional, wanted to practise with someone bowling at him with a bit of pace. With none of the club’s seamers present, Lever had a go. “I managed to knock his castle down a few times,” he recalled, “and from then on off-breaks and keeping wicket were out so far as I was concerned.”Lever, who has died aged 84 after a short illness, was 19 at the time; within a year he had signed for Lancashire. That it was Lever who happened to be in the nets at the time was probably no coincidence: the Australian spinner Neil Dansie, who played for Todmorden as a professional in 1955 and 1956, remembered him being “first to arrive and last to leave. I said with that dedication and enthusiasm this boy is destined to go far in the game. Fifteen years later there he was, getting off the plane to represent England in Australia.” Continue reading...",
