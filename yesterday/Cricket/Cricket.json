Dhoni had to deny that he was retiring midway through the season after his parents were pictured at his match for Chennai Super Kings against Delhi Capitals. Plus we analyse the return of Jasprit Bumrah who has played his first match in 93 days after injuring his back and how big Virat Kohli’s achievement is of reaching 13,000 T20 runs. Plus we go behind the scenes and hear what life is like for a cricket agent. We are joined by Cameron Richardson who manages a number of female Australian players including Ashes hero Alana King. He tells us that when he first saw her bowl at the age of 18, she reminded him of Shane Warne. He also shares with us the difference between managing male and female players and about balancing player burnout.

    "description": "Does Zak Crawley’s current form warrant a place in the England Test squad? With injuries to 4 England quicks, can Essex fast bowler Sam Cook finally break into the side? And how does the ICC future-proof cricket? Henry Moeran is alongside former Ashes winner Steven Finn and Test Match Special’s Nikesh Rughani to discuss all that. They look at the alternative options to open for England instead of Zak Crawley, as well as the reasons why Sam Cook has been linked to a call-up for the national side.
