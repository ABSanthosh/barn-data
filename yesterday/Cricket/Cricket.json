He explains how Gill is a mix of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. It‚Äôs not just a new era for India, but also for England. Harry Brook is the new men‚Äôs white ball captain for a series of three ODIs and three T20s against West Indies. We ask whether Brook is the right choice to improve England‚Äôs poor form in limited overs cricket, and whether this extra responsibility could affect his Test form. Plus: the team also reflect on Sikandar Raza‚Äôs remarkable journey from playing for Zimbabwe in Nottingham on Saturday, to hitting the title winning runs in the Pakistan Super League in Lahore on Sunday.Photo: India's Shubman Gill celebrates after scoring a century during the third day of the first Test cricket match between India and Bangladesh at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on September 21, 2024.
