    "description": "The reigning champions have tumbled from first to third place in the World Test Championship standings and there remains little margin for error Australia have only just begun the first of back-to-back home summers where an ageing side is seeking to cement its legacy in a pair of Test series against arch-rivals India and England. Yet one match into the stretch of 10 high-stakes clashes and cracks are already starting to appear that might end some international red-ball careers – and the defence of one of their two world crowns.India quick Jaspit Bumrah had more than enough tools to prise open the fractures in Australia’s batting lineup when twice tearing through the top order at the hosts’ former fortress in Perth. The humbling defeat leaves Australia needing to overcome a 1-0 deficit to win a Test series for the first time in 27 years if they are to reclaim the Border-Gavaskar trophy.
