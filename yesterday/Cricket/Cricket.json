    "description": "A lack of pitches, kit and coaching has held the sport back for far too long but Major League Cricket may be the answerIf you look south from the Manhattan end of Brooklyn Bridge, you can just about imagine the cricket field that used to be beneath what is now the South Seaport ‚Äì and, if you squint, pretend that the people making their way around the bars and clubs and restaurants are the descendants of the same New York crowd who attended a match here between a local team and a London XI in 1751.

It was killed by a shortage of pitches, kit and coaching, and by the rise of baseball, the great American pastime. Baseball had two advantages. It was easier to play ‚Äì all you needed was a bat, a ball, four bases and a field ‚Äì and if you were good at it, you could make a lot more money. Plenty of professional cricketers made the switch. The brothers George and Harry Wright, who had both played for St George‚Äôs Cricket Club in New York, where their father was groundsman, were founding members of the first pro baseball team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings. Both are in the Hall of Fame, and Harry is still known as the ‚Äúfather of the game‚Äù. Early proprietors such as AG Spalding, another ex-cricketer, sold baseball as the indigenous American sport. It was the patriotic choice. Cricket was inescapably English. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Alison Mitchell, Clint Wheeldon and Sunil Gupta take stock of the Indian Premier League and discuss whether MS Dhoni should retire at the end of this season. Dhoni had to deny that he was retiring midway through the season after his parents were pictured at his match for Chennai Super Kings against Delhi Capitals. Plus we analyse the return of Jasprit Bumrah who has played his first match in 93 days after injuring his back and how big Virat Kohli‚Äôs achievement is of reaching 13,000 T20 runs. Plus we go behind the scenes and hear what life is like for a cricket agent. We are joined by Cameron Richardson who manages a number of female Australian players including Ashes hero Alana King. He tells us that when he first saw her bowl at the age of 18, she reminded him of Shane Warne. He also shares with us the difference between managing male and female players and about balancing player burnout.
