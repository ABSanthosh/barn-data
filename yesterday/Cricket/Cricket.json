Obviously we‚Äôve stripped out a little intermediate context there. But these two events, these seemingly random nodes in time, are in fact ephemerally connected.What do you mean, you haven‚Äôt been following Hampshire‚Äôs progress in the Global Super League Twenty20 in Guyana? It‚Äôs been playing live on YouTube every night. Nick Knight and Mark Butcher are among the commentators. International stars like Moeen Ali, Carlos Brathwaite and Shan Masood are featuring.
