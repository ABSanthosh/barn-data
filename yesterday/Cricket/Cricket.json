It doesn‚Äôt help that my beloved Western Bulldogs (Long story short: some disreputable caddies on the LPGA decided I needed an AFL team and I didn‚Äôt have the sense to ignore them) are playing St. Kilda right now. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not just that. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm finding it hard to get a sense of who is in form, especially with the bat. Maybe it‚Äôs because we were distracted by Tom Banton‚Äôs 371, which he‚Äôs followed with scores of 6, 0 and 5. How long a lead does a triple centurion get before his chain is yanked? ‚ÄúIf Surrey‚Äôs Dom Sibley adds significantly to his 40 overnight, does he hold the crown after a 66 at Essex and then 100 not out and 1055 against Hampshire? Incidentally he made 3 in his one game for Khulna Tigers in Chittagong, which is officially called Chattogram, which would be a great name for a social media platform wouldn‚Äôt it? ‚ÄúOr is it Tom Haines? His 174 against Surrey in this round of matches is, weather permitting, potentially match winning and his second innings 141 set up the victory against Somerset last week. ‚ÄúAs for bowlers... have you got anything? [Ed ‚Äì My immediate thought is Fergus O‚ÄôNeill?] ‚ÄúThe Bulldogs, incidentally, have living legend Marcus Bontempelli aka The Bont back for the first time this season, but as I speak our 6 ft 10 in young superstar-to-be ruckman Sam Darcy has just hobbled off with an injured knee, which would be a disaster for the Doggies.‚Äù Continue reading...",

    "description": "Alison Mitchell, Clint Wheeldon and Sunil Gupta take stock of the Indian Premier League and discuss whether MS Dhoni should retire at the end of this season. Dhoni had to deny that he was retiring midway through the season after his parents were pictured at his match for Chennai Super Kings against Delhi Capitals. Plus we analyse the return of Jasprit Bumrah who has played his first match in 93 days after injuring his back and how big Virat Kohli‚Äôs achievement is of reaching 13,000 T20 runs. Plus we go behind the scenes and hear what life is like for a cricket agent. We are joined by Cameron Richardson who manages a number of female Australian players including Ashes hero Alana King. He tells us that when he first saw her bowl at the age of 18, she reminded him of Shane Warne. He also shares with us the difference between managing male and female players and about balancing player burnout.
