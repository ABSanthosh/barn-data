Mind you, the very end came right in the middle, Australia winning the fifth Test against India halfway through the third day in Sydney.It was not even the middle if you counted overs bowled, the match using 190 of a possible 450 on a pitch that grew less fit for purpose with each passing day.

The teams now play each other in Sydney with the series 2-1 in favour of the Australian side who will win the trophy for the first since 2015 if they avoid defeat. We debate the apparent unrest in the India dressing room and the potential retirements of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. Jim Maxwell says that the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is now bigger than the Ashes. Plus, we discuss whether South Africa deserve to be in the World Test Championship final after comments were made questioning their perceived easy route to the final.And we are joined by Ed Stoddart who is the CEO of Stuart Canvas productions. They manufacture hover covers, which are used around the world. Ed tells us about the significance of the technology and the impact of climate change.

    "description": "We look back at the best of Stumped in 2024, which gives you a chance to listen to some of the standout moments from the last twelve months including our trip to New York. The USA co-hosted the Men‚Äôs T20 World Cup for the first time and we spoke to fans from around the world about how cricket can grow in America. Plus, we spoke to Bryan R Caine who is an umpire in the United States about his love of the game and how it can develop in the future. We also hear from one of the greatest batters of all time, the West Indies legend Brian Lara who joined Alison in the commentary box at Lord‚Äôs. He shared what it meant to him when he scored 400 not out for his country and if he believes Test Cricket is sustainable long-term. New Zealand won their first ever T20 World Cup, when they beat South Africa in the final. All-rounder Maddy Green took us back to that special day and shared the emotion she felt about finally getting that winners medal around her neck. Plus, the Stumped team debate whether reaching 100 Test caps carries the same significance it used to? And arguably England‚Äôs greatest ever bowler Jimmy Anderson finally hung up his boots this year, when he retired from international cricket. He joined the team to talk about retirement, personal loss and what is next for both himself and England.Photo: Cricket fans cheer and wave the Indian flag during the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 at Nassau County International Cricket Stadium at Eisenhower Memorial Park in East Meadow, New York on June 9, 2024(Photo by J.
