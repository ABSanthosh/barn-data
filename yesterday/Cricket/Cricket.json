    "description": "Ahead of the third season of the Women's Premier League, Alison Mitchell, Jim Maxwell, and Charu Sharma hear from former England captain Charlotte Edwards and former India fast bowler Jhulan Goswami on what it‚Äôs like working together as coaches at Mumbai Indians after being great rivals in their playing days. Edwards, currently head coach at MI, also says she wants to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô English cricket and has urged the ECB to ‚Äòget in touch‚Äô. It comes as the organisation conducts a review into the Ashes defeat to Australia. Following the recent success of India‚Äôs U19 side at youth level, Jhulan gives her opinion on whether she thinks that victory in Malaysia can help lead the senior team to victory at the Women‚Äôs World Cup in Autumn.
