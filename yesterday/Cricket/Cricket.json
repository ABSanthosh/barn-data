The plan was to make inroads before the last, vague vestige of green was burned from the surface and it so nearly came good during an opening spell from Chris Woakes that brought the wicket of KL Rahul but also two marginal umpire decisions that both favoured that batting side. ‚ÄúOn a day like this, it is frustrating,‚Äù Woakes said. ‚ÄúIt was a good day but it felt like a day that could have been so different.‚ÄùTwice batters were saved on umpire‚Äôs call when England reviewed on-field decisions of not out ‚Äì first in the seventh over, with India 14 without loss, when Yashasvi Jaiswal was reprieved, and then in the 11th, when they were 21 for one, with Karun Nair the beneficiary. On both occasions DRS technology showed the ball going on to hit the stumps, but not by enough for the TV umpire to reverse the decisions taken by the Bangladeshi umpire Sharfuddoula.
