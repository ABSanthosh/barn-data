    "description": "Chris Woakes and Abhishek Jhunjhunwala join Mark Chapman to discuss the IPL – where does it stand right now? Hear from Australian, Aaron Hardie, as he talks about his experience of playing for Punjab Kings. They also discuss the lack of English involvement – only 10 English players will feature – the lowest since 2020. Jofra Archer has also had an eventful start for the Rajasthan Royals, having taken the first maiden of the tournament, but also scoring a record 76 in four overs. Following Eoin Morgan’s comments on England’s white-ball captaincy, could Ben Stokes take the role? Also, hear from Jonny Bairstow, new captain of Yorkshire as the County Championship returns. And Somerset’s Will Smeed joins the podcast as he comes out of red ball retirement… at the age of 23!",
