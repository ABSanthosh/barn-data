    "description": "Atkinson and Carse have followed in Anderson‚Äôs and Broad‚Äôs giant footsteps, while Filer and Bell are a pairing to fulfil Christmas wishesFast bowlers are the Formula One engines of a cricket team: purringly powerful when they want to be, painfully vulnerable when bits fall off. When a partnership works, and sticks ‚Äì Lillee and Thompson, Ambrose and Walsh, Wasim and Waqar ‚Äì they carry the team on their shoulders. When that partnership fades, teams often falter, losing their identity.It is nearly 17 years ago that Michael Vaughan and Peter Moores informed Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison that they were to be dropped for the second Test against New Zealand at Wellington, replaced by James Anderson and Stuart Broad. Harmison played only six more Tests and Hoggard never played for England again, while Anderson and Broad famously went on to be the most successful bowling pair in Test history. Continue reading...",

    "description": "After India managed to wrest back some momentum in Brisbane, the spinner‚Äôs sudden departure opens up cracks in a surprising shortcomingAs the clouds clear over the Gabba after the third Test between Australia and India ended in a stalemate, both sides have reason to sift through the rain-soaked rubble in search of prevailing positives. Any hint of assurance will be gladly pocketed at this stage after the two sides clocked up a thumping victory apiece, as well as a corresponding defeat, while each having numerous frailties exposed across the opening three Tests.The hosts can embrace their extended periods of control with both bat and ball, and the return to form of fading great Steve Smith ahead of the next contest in Melbourne. The tourists will be emboldened by bravely fighting off the prospect of following-on under dark skies on the penultimate day in Brisbane.
