They didn‚Äôt even manage bronze. Heather Knight was ruled out on the eve of the tournament with a hip injury and the stand-in captain, Nat Sciver-Brunt, struggled to assert her authority: her wife, Katherine, was reprimanded for swearing on the field of play; England threw away their bronze-medal match against New Zealand; and Sophie Ecclestone was shown live on television knocking a chair over with her bat.Why hark back to something that happened more than two years ago? Because England‚Äôs disastrous group-stage exit from the T20 World Cup, at the hands of West Indies, had eerie echoes of summer 2022.
