    "description": "Broadcaster, author and stats guru Jarrod Kimber joins the podcast to talk about his new book The Art Of Batting - a deep dive into what makes a great Test match run-maker and using sophisticated metrics to identify the best batters of all time. In this first part, we examine the difference between 'batting' and runmaking, the five phases of batsmanship through the ages, how players - eg Lara, Richards, Bradman - were often shaped by their environment and which outstanding players didn't make the top fifty.

After trying to digest this astonishing performance, Simon Hughes and Simon Mann talk to Leicestershire's Ian Holland, the leading wicket-taker in Division 2, about being top of the table, who are the best all-rounders in the county game and who has the silliest nicknames.
