Plus a letter from Christine WaltersHugh Muir’s farewell to line judges at Wimbledon, who have been replaced by electronic wizardry, fails to mention the greatest benefit: we are no longer subjected to the inane slow hand-clapping that accompanied the pause before the verdict of the electronic line judge, as if it could speed up the decision (Look at Wimbledon without human line judges and tell me this: do you really want life to be perfect? 2 July).Technology has been applied to cricket to its benefit, with the DRS (decision review system) assisting the umpires. Yet one could argue that football has been ruined by VAR (video assistant referee), as referees have become slaves to it.

    "description": "India’s new captain was given chance to dictate the second Test and has shown he is one to take over as era of Fab Four wanesTwo games into the series we have already witnessed something very special from Shubman Gill. In the second Test at Edgbaston he produced a real rarity: an individual performance that defines and dominates a game. Not just piling on the runs, but forcing his opponents to toil in the field until they felt exhausted and out of options.That fatigue affects batters’ mental clarity and their decision-making – what to play, when to leave – as well as their movement and their footwork. Reducing England to 25 for three at the end of the second day went a long way to deciding the match. As well as India bowled with the new ball, it was Gill’s remorselessness that created the conditions for it to happen. Continue reading...",
