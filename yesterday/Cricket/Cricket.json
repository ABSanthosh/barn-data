    "description": "Alison Mitchell, Clint Wheeldon and Sunil Gupta take stock of the Indian Premier League and discuss whether MS Dhoni should retire at the end of this season. Dhoni had to deny that he was retiring midway through the season after his parents were pictured at his match for Chennai Super Kings against Delhi Capitals. Plus we analyse the return of Jasprit Bumrah who has played his first match in 93 days after injuring his back and how big Virat Kohli‚Äôs achievement is of reaching 13,000 T20 runs. Plus we go behind the scenes and hear what life is like for a cricket agent. We are joined by Cameron Richardson who manages a number of female Australian players including Ashes hero Alana King. He tells us that when he first saw her bowl at the age of 18, she reminded him of Shane Warne. He also shares with us the difference between managing male and female players and about balancing player burnout.
