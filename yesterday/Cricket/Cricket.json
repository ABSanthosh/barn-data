Ben Duckett, 30 years old and totally at peace with his game, is an increasingly remarkable player. I‚Äôm not sure there has ever been an England opener quite like him.Ôªø‚ÄúCan‚Äôt help but feel England‚Äôs team looks a tad lop-sided,‚Äù says James Brough. ‚ÄúSeven front line batsmen and then batting down to Adil Rashid at no 10 - all well and good. But the bowling looks a bit optimistic. Three seamers, of whom Overton has not yet convinced at international level, and Rashid.

Whether Harry Brook‚Äôs captaincy can deliver silverware like Eoin Morgan‚Äôs transformative reign remains to be seen but this 238-run mauling of West Indies made for a handy start.Not only did Brook‚Äôs men amass 400 for eight after being put in by Shai Hope but, for the first time in the format‚Äôs history, they did so without a centurion on the day. Instead it was a collective assault of the bowlers and the poor boundary riders, with four half-centuries and ‚Äì in another first ‚Äì every member of the top seven making at least 30.

    "description": "This week we discuss how new India captain Shubman Gill may lead the side. A former member of India‚Äôs coaching set up, R Sridhar, is our guest. He explains how Gill is a mix of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. It‚Äôs not just a new era for India, but also for England. Harry Brook is the new men‚Äôs white ball captain for a series of three ODIs and three T20s against West Indies. We ask whether Brook is the right choice to improve England‚Äôs poor form in limited overs cricket, and whether this extra responsibility could affect his Test form. Plus: the team also reflect on Sikandar Raza‚Äôs remarkable journey from playing for Zimbabwe in Nottingham on Saturday, to hitting the title winning runs in the Pakistan Super League in Lahore on Sunday.Photo: India's Shubman Gill celebrates after scoring a century during the third day of the first Test cricket match between India and Bangladesh at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on September 21, 2024.
