Pakistan are off the mark and so is Ayub. Now Shafique gets off his duck with a strong punch through point. Glenn Maxwell retrieves it in the outfield. Now Cummins the conjuror appears! His fourth ball is a beauty, just back of a length and it whizzes past the edge of Shafique‚Äôs flailing blade. Good comeback by the skipper.1st over: Pakistan 0-0 (Saim 0, Shafique 0) Abdullah Shafique has survives the first couple of deliveries and already Starc has extracted a slight hint of swing back into the right-handed batter. Third ball is a fat full-pitched yorker on the offside and Shafique has a swish at it but is beaten for pace. He can‚Äôt get near the fifth and dead bats the final delivery.

But the captain, Pat Cummins (32 not out), playing his first ODI since last year‚Äôs stunning World Cup final triumph, was again there at the end in a tight chase as Australia got home with 99 balls to spare. One of the best quicks of his generation, Cummins has quickly become a specialist run-chaser in the last 18 months after being involved in two close Test wins and three ODI victories.

Masood talks about the team finding ‚Äúbalance in the middle of chaos‚Äù, the precarious nature of captaincy, and the future of dropped batting star Babar Azam.Alison, Jim Maxwell and Charu Sharma all reflect on the recent success for both New Zealand and Pakistan.Photo: General view of play during an ICC Men's T20 World Cup match between Pakistan and New Zealand.
