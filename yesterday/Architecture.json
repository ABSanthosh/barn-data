    "description": "A solid white form that contrasts with its immediate surroundings. This is the principle behind the design of Casa Bosque, located on a narrow lot within a horizontal condominium of attached houses. This white canvas, being homogeneous, does not evoke the subjective mental image of a house and allows for an open perception of what is seen, offering a complete reading of the volume, without areas of concentration or elements that “pull” the eye. As artist Robert Ryman states, “white is merely a way to expose other elements, allowing other things to become visible.” By choosing this volume, the design begins with a unified concept where the design itself defines the flows and layouts contained within this rigid geometry.",

Therefore, the summer house's materials drew inspiration from houses built during Skagen's Black Period, when charred wood from shipwrecks was often used to build houses whose roofs were covered in straw. A thatched roof and a black-painted wooden exterior were thus used for the facades.",

A previously colonized town by the Portuguese, Dutch, and British now breathes new life into its built landscape. Across the world, in the German city of Kassel, the scars of World War II are etched into the environment, deep under its revived cultural soul. Both Kochi and Kassel, though worlds apart in geography and history, shared a commonality: the power of art and festivals to heal. In the aftermath of historical trauma, these cities found renewal in the creative expression of artists from around the globe.",

The project's eye-catching design and two towers place it in dialogue with the skylines of Brooklyn and Manhattan and the rest of the Domino Sugar Factory site.

    "description": "Polycarbonate, commonly used in roofing and industrial cladding, has gone beyond its initial applications to become a material widely used across various architectural typologies. Its combination of strength, lightness, easy installation, and ability to allow natural light to pass through has made it an attractive option for residential, educational, and even cultural architecture projects. In homes, polycarbonate not only helps create bright and comfortable environments but also allows for creative use of translucency to generate private spaces without sacrificing visual connection to the outdoors.",

    "description": "In Delirious New York, Rem Koolhaas vividly discusses the Downtown Athletic Club, a striking example of how an unassuming building exterior can conceal a vibrant mix of distinct, self-contained programs. Inside the uniform facade of this skyscraper, a private athletic club hosts an eclectic range of facilities—boxing gyms next to oyster bars and interior golf ranges below swimming pools—all segregated yet highly accessible. The Downtown Athletic Club epitomized the dynamism of New York's skyscrapers at the time, showcasing the thrill of capitalism through a selective, inward-focused world of leisure and privilege for the selected. This \"machine of programs\" operated independently of the external city as an isolated ecosystem within its walls. Yet, one might ask: could a similar model, designed for public use, create a more inclusive, lively community and neighborhood experience? This will activate the building within, instead of only serving the selected elites, and influence and transform the urban fabric and shapes around the building. In Hong Kong, a distant parallel can be drawn with the Municipal Services Buildings (MSBs)—publicly-funded structures that serve the community by integrating diverse functions within a singular vast building mass, much like the Downtown Athletic Club.",

This comprehensive approach addresses the functionality of buildings aiming to transform every aspect of design, promoting accessibility from scratch. A key milestone in this matter was the establishment of legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the US. This document established a legal framework to prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities and set a precedent for promoting the design of public spaces and services that are accessible to all.",
