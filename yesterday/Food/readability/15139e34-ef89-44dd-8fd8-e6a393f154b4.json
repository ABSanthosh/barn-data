Thankfully, we have more than 3,000 soup recipes on our site, so we’re swimming in spoonable options. But, also, we get it: you’ve got better things to do than hover by the stove all day, so we decided to round up our 23 best soup recipes that require a little “set-it-and-forget-it” magic. We've also included suggestions on how to spend those precious minutes while your soup simmers. From Our Shop 1. White Bean \u0026 Sausage Soup From one of our recent Recipe Drops, this white bean and sausage soup is hearty and forgiving if you’re the type to get distracted while cooking. Although Nea recommends simmering it for at least 20 minutes, she said it could go even longer—up to 40—and will be just fine. Let it cook while you fold a load of laundry or catch up with a friend on the phone (people still do that, right?). 2. Beef, Mushroom \u0026 Barley Soup This recipe will have you saying goodbye to the canned stuff forever. With a two-hour simmer time, it’s a great opportunity to deep clean your room, tackle the bathroom, or cross off an episode (or two!) on your watchlist. 3. Finnish Salmon Soup This classic Finish soup is unexpected in the best way—yes, we’re talking about seafood and dairy together. It only requires 10 minutes of simmering, but per Noah’s instructions, you can skip the cornstarch slurry and let it cook longer. Use the extra time to finish a load of dishes. 4. Tuscan Ribollita This Stanley Tucci-approved soup is an Italian staple for good reason. Packed with kale and day-old bread, it’s cozy and comforting. Plus, with just 25 minutes of simmering, you’ll have enough time to tackle a chapter of the new Sally Rooney. 5. Smoky Minestrone With Tortellini \u0026 Pesto Tortellini gets a flavorful kick after simmering in this smoky minestrone broth. With a 30 to 40 minute simmer time, you’ll have plenty of time to vacuum or plan your next meal. 6. The Best Chili We’re counting chili as a soup because it’s a classic simmering option. This recipe calls for an hour and a half, but like most chilis, it can simmer for as long as you want. It’s also great in a slow cooker—the perfect chance to catch up on Squid Game while it cooks in the background. 7. Brothy Bean Soup with Parmesan This is a soup you can whip up on a busy weeknight in 30 minutes. But, if you have more time, you can let it simmer longer for even better flavor. Use that half hour to clean up the kitchen or prep tomorrow’s lunch. 8. Lemony Chicken \u0026 Rice Soup There’s a reason “easy” is in the name of this recipe, and it’s even simpler with a rotisserie chicken. It calls for a mix of veggies and herbs you likely have on hand, but feel free to swap them for whatever’s in your fridge. It also gives you 30 minutes of simmer time to spend however you want. 9. Turkish Red Lentil Soup This lentil soup is inspired by the author’s trip to Istanbul. It’s a lighter, brothier version of the classic, but the warm blend of spices makes it perfect for any season, especially winter. While you wait, flip through a cookbook or magazine (or more of our recipes) for your next meal inspiration. 10. Lentil \u0026 Sausage Soup A true one-pot meal that’s hearty but not too heavy. Between the lentils, veggies, and sausage, it’s incredibly filling. After simmering for 30 to 45 minutes, all that’s left is a few stirs and seasoning to taste. This gives you just enough time to clean out the fridge. 11. Pasta e Fagioli This just so happens to be the second Stanley Tucci-approved soup on this list. Pasta-forward and designed to simmer for five hours, it’s ideal for a slow cooker. A true set-it-and-forget-it recipe (truly, you could go and see The Brutalist) that only gets better the longer it cooks. 12. Martha Stewarts’s Tom Kha Gai From Martha Stewart’s cookbook, this slow cooker recipe has never failed us. It comes together in under an hour, but definitely benefits from some extra simmer time. One pot is all you need, and in the meantime, you can get at finally organizing your sock drawer. 13. Butternut Squash Soup with Shrimp Another unexpected seafood pairing that just works. The homemade shrimp stock requires an hour of simmering, but it’s well worth it. Smoky from Old Bay and rum, and sweet from roasted butternut squash, it’s a flavor-packed bowl. It might just inspire you to organize your spice rack in the meantime (because isn’t that oddly satisfying?). 14. Vegetable Beef Soup A cross between a tomato chili and a hearty beef stew, this recipe is designed for the Instant Pot, but can easily be made on the stovetop or in a slow cooker. It needs at least 20 minutes of simmer time which allows you to pick out a movie or playlist to pair with your meal. 15. Cornish Game Hen Soup Boil Cornish hens with fresh ginger and a handful of garlic and you’ll get the most tender, flavorful meat. To fully cook the meat, it needs to simmer for an hour, which gives you plenty of time to make the optional fried shallots. 16. Winter Squash Soup with Chile \u0026 Mint If you’ve never thought to pair squash with chili and mint, let this recipe inspire you. It’s refreshingly easy and perfectly smooth after some roasting and simmering time. While it thickens, set the table with your favorite soup bowls or pick out a vino to pair with dinner. 17. Red Curry Chicken Noodle Soup A curried twist on a classic chicken noodle soup, this recipe blends fresh flavors like coconut, ginger, and lime. Don’t be fooled by the ingredient list, there’s minimal chopping if you use a food processor or blender. As it simmers, you can do a quick reset—clear counters, stack dishes, and prep for serving. 18. Fire-roasted Tomato Soup Inspired by the Italian stew peperonata, this soup uses fire-roasted tomatoes for a subtle heat. It requires about an hour of cooking, but the caramelized onions are a must. While you wait, consider writing a note or catching up with a loved one. 19. Red Cabbage \u0026 Sausage Soup This isn’t the cabbage soup you’re imagining. With sausage, potatoes, and heavy cream, it’s a hearty dish perfect for winter. It requires a bit more stirring than other recipes, but the flavor makes it worth the extra effort. During the hour cook-time, you could organize your pantry, or prep some veggies for the next few meals. 20. Greek Lemon Soup The magic of this soup lies in tempering the eggs. While the process might sound complicated, it’s simpler than you think. After combining the lemon and egg mixture, it simmers for around 25 minutes. Sneak in a 15-minute stretch session or yoga flow to unwind. 21. Minestrone Our best classic minestrone that packs in the veggies, beans, and Parmesan. With a three-hour simmer time, it’s ideal for tackling the big tasks like deep cleaning or closet organizing. 22. Cream of Mushroom \u0026 Wild Rice Soup Don’t let the “vegan” in the title fool you, this soup is just as creamy as the classic. Full-fat coconut milk gives it all the richness without the dairy. It simmers for about an hour depending on the kind of rice you use. Read a few chapters of your favorite book while the aromas fill the kitchen. 23. Broccoli, Lemon \u0026 Parmesan Soup This soup has just five main ingredients and relies mostly on broccoli (which cooks for about an hour). It's simple, comforting, and perfect for a cozy weeknight meal or an easy lunch. While it simmers, take a moment to prep some bread for dipping or whisk together a quick vinaigrette for a side salad.
