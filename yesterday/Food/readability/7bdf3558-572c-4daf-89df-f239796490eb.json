To make sure I can meet everyone’s needs, I keep a pack of frozen hash browns in my fridge at all times. They’re perfect because they’re gluten-free, dairy-free, and vegan- and vegetarian-friendly, so there’s always something delicious for everyone to enjoy. Typically I just bake them until they’re golden and crispy on the edges with a soft potato center. But recently I discovered a clever way to take them to the next level and make them even more satisfying.In an Instagram video posted by Jessica Hirsch, a content creator who shares recipes and cooking tutorials, she revealed an ingenious hack for turning frozen hash browns into a hearty, cheesy casserole. The best part? It’s super easy, and you only need three ingredients: hash brown patties, eggs, and cheese.Here’s how to make hash brown casserole: Preheat your oven to 375°F. Then grab a sheet pan and lightly grease it or line it with parchment paper. Next, arrange the hash brown patties evenly on the pan and bake for about eight minutes to “make them crispy,” as Hirsch recommends. While that’s baking, whisk together a few eggs as you would for a scramble. After eight minutes, pour the whisked eggs over the crispy hash browns, then sprinkle with grated cheese. Bake for an additional 15 minutes. Once it’s done, remove it from the oven, slice it up, and serve.If you want to keep it simple, you can stop here, but if you’re up for a few extra-tasty touches, this hash brown casserole lends itself well to customization. Try adding heavy cream, milk, or plain Greek yogurt into the egg mixture for a richer, creamier texture. You can also mix in some savory extras like crispy bacon, crumbled sausage, or sautéed mushrooms. And when it comes to cheese, the options are endless — Gouda, Parmesan, or Colby Jack all work wonderfully.Although this hack isn’t brand-new — many recipe creators and bloggers have been making hash brown casseroles for years — people still loved being reminded of this quick and easy breakfast idea. One commenter on Hirsch’s post said, “Why did I never think of this?” while another wrote, “Yum! Totally trying this one.” So, the next time you host a brunch, use this trick as inspiration to make your spread even more exciting.",
