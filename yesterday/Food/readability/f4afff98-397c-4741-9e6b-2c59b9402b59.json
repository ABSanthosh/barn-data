  "text": "Happy June! I hope you’re enjoying the warmer weather, the bittersweet joys of graduations and the end of the school year, and settling into the more relaxed pace of summer.  Friends, I’ve been keeping a secret from y’all: after 20 years in the classroom, I am leaving my job as an English teacher to become a middle school vice principal! The process has been a long one — I interviewed in March, officially accepted the position a few weeks ago, and finally, it was announced publicly. I am incredibly excited! I have had my administrative credential for seven years now, but I intentionally waited to make the move until I felt ready. There was no “aha” moment of knowing for sure, but once I applied, I felt sure that this was the time. I am sure that I will be sad when I say goodbye to my students, but I primarily feel optimistic about this change. I was telling a friend that the most overwhelming feeling I have right now is that my time in the classroom is complete.  As someone who is fairly change-averse, it’s a relief to feel this sort of peace over my choice. I’m excited to step into my new role, utilizing the skills I’ve acquired as a teacher in a different capacity, and to engage in ongoing learning and growth on the job.  I go back to work a little earlier than usual now, so I’m determined to make the most of my abbreviated summer. I’ve already been logging plenty of pool time, have a stack of books to read, and, of course, some summer projects I want to complete. But I’m also looking forward to relaxing, and more importantly, CELEBRATING! Here’s to an ending, and a very exciting beginning!  Sending you love this week (and always)! •  I bought myself a present to celebrate my new job: this THATCH Malene Amazonite Bail charm. It’s so vibrant and adds just the right amount of sparkle to an outfit. I’m eyeing the teardrop version in Lapis if anyone wants to send my spouse a hint. (THATCH Jewelry)   •  I LOVED this piece from Emily In Your Phone’s Substack called “Jam Girl Summer Is The New Self-Care.“ A slow and beautiful life? Sign me up. In terms of jam, don’t sleep on Trader Joe’s Tart Cherry Fruit Spread. It’s perfection on sourdough. I’ll be going back to hoard some to last me for awhile. (Substack, Trader Joe’s) •  We have been enjoying our pool, and I’ve barbecued an unreal number of hot dogs recently, but I’m looking to expand my meals into other summer foods. This Green Goddess sandwich and Watermelon Peach Caprese salad are going in the rotation. Ever since Joy shared her grilled strawberry shortcake recipe last week, I’ve thought of little else, but I’m also planning to whip up the kind with really, really good biscuits as a base. (Joy The Baker) •  In theory, I’d love to be someone who travels without a phone. If that speaks to you, this article has you covered. If not, here are the best apps for travel! (NYT Gift Link, Marie Claire) •  Summer opens up time for me to have fun in the kitchen; however, it’s simply too hot to turn on the oven to do so. Thankfully, JTB has us covered with a Tres Leches Icebox Cake (YES!), a Cherry Lemon Icebox Cake (elite flavor combination), and Saltine Brownie Ice Cream Sandwiches (here for a sweet-salty moment). (Joy The Baker) •  If you’re looking to make new connections but are struggling to move past the traditional small talk, this article about asking magical questions is so helpful and inspiring! (NPR) •  So, what is creatine? Great question, this article would love to tell you. I’ve been taking SWOLY creatine gummies for awhile now, and I am far less sore, even after heavy lifts. Not sure I look like a Greek god in photos, despite the website’s promise, but I will take the ability to walk after crushing heavy squats a few times a week! (SELF, Swoly) •  I am a Chelsea Fagan (of the Financial Diet) superfan, and find everything she does to be elegant but also focused on doing good in the world and using her privilege to effect change. Goals. Her incredible Manhattan apartment was on Apartment Therapy this week, and I loved getting a glimpse at this perfectly appointed space. She has written two romance novels, A Perfect Vintage, which I loved, and this week, she released The High Dive, which I’m saving for my first pool read of the season! And you know I’ve already pre-ordered her book on hosting, Having People Over, because her social media is FULL of tips for being a fantastic host. (Instagram, The Financial Diet, Apartment Therapy, Bookshop) •  One of my favorite things to do when I’m traveling is to try as many different coffee shops as possible. If you’ve ever wanted to know the best way to order coffee when you’re traveling, this post has you covered. It gave me wanderlust immediately. (Food and Wine) •  The Cut shared the items that are always in their beauty closet. I found a few new things to try, but was honestly pretty meh on most of them. You can see my latest beauty favorites here! (The Cut, Substack)  •  I’m not typically a big red, white, and blue gal, but I am OBSESSED with these new prints in my all-time favorite LAKE Pajamas. The tank and shorts set in Morning Glory have been sitting in my cart for days, and I’m also dithering about the cobalt stripe nightgown! They’re the only pajamas that keep me cool overnight, and can you ever have too many jammies? My pajama drawer says yes, but my (sweaty, perimenopausal body) says no! (LAKE Pajamas) •  I grew up with many members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I’ve been watching the Hulu series “Secret Lives of Mormon Wives.” I found this piece on their garments, as well as the evolving conversation about the modernization of the church, to be really fascinating. (NYT Gift Link) •  If you’ve got a competitive streak, you’ll love this piece by writer Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya about how tennis helped her overcome her sense of competition in her writing practice. I related to it hard, but even if you’re not a writer, it applies to just about everything. Related: I am taking some very casual tennis lessons this summer in my continued journey as a Fitness Person. Let me add that if you have a ponytail and you like to be outdoors, this Lululemon Ponytail Hat is your new BFF. (LitHub, Lululemon) •  As a lucky Northern California resident, I’ve had the joy of going to the brilliant Alice Waters’ Chez Panisse, and I’m eager to recreate their Blueberry Cobbler! (NYT Gift Link) •  I’ve never, ever worn white pants or shorts, but this summer, I’m diving in. I can’t say enough about how PERFECT these AGOLDE Parker Long shorts are in Pannacotta are, and I also love these Madewell Perfect Vintage wide leg jeans in white. Join me on my white pants journey! (Anthropologie, Madewell) •  If you’re not listening to Amy Poehler’s Good Hang podcast yet, I highly recommend it. I loved the Kathryn Hahn episode, and this article about the episode and the power of female friendships is so good. Imagine not going through life with girlfriends? It would be so sad. (Everygirl) 19 Responses Congratulations!!! P.S. As someone who mainly reads about recipes, excited that I have all the ingredients for the blueberry cobbler and too many blueberries if that is possible. Congrats on the change–as another reader remarked, we need good admin as well as good teachers! I changed roles from h.s. English teacher to Pk – 12 instructional coach about 5 years ago (tho I have returned to the classroom for events like . . . oh, COVID, and the loss of a teacher) and it has been stimulating and energizing–and yet I still miss the classroom. Something about those connections to burgeoning human beings is hard to replace, much as I love my current role. Ah, mixed emotions–such a part of life. :) Anyway: enjoy your summer, and dive into your new role! Congratulations on your new position. You’ll be great! I had to laugh when I clicked on the “long” white shorts link. It must be my age, but those shorts are not long. They qualify as short shorts to me, but they are cute. I like white shorts and pants in summer. Congratulations! Super exciting times. Also – I wore white pants for the very first time to an event on Friday so I can empathize with you right there. Fell in love with the cut (snagged a pair of Alex Mills ones on sale) and am a convert. I did pack a Tide pen in my purse for the potential inevitable though! I think that’s a wise idea — I’m planning to wear them on a trip this week, and I’ll need to grab a Tide pen! I just bought a duffle bag from shore bags and I think I’m going to love it. It has a lot of versatility. Congratulations! I’m a 20+ year teacher (last 15 in high school) and I admire the jump. But we need good, supportive administrators who remember the crazy of the classroom. Your new staff will be lucky to have you. Enjoy summer break (I’ve about 3 weeks to go!) I hope the next three weeks pass quickly! Thanks for your kind words! Congratulations Amy! Cheers to taking the next steps. You are amazing! Happy Summer! Thank you, Mary! I appreciate it! Congratulations on your new position! Have an amazing summer! Thank you, Dawn! Congrats on your promotion! Here’s a great app for travel -Libby! Leave your print books at home and read on your phone. Libby works in conjunction with your local library card. There are audio books and magazines as well (depends on your local library for the magazines). I use Libby with an iPad at home, but when traveling, my phone works just fine. Once the books are downloaded, you do not need a WiFi connection. Happy reading! Congratulations Amy! The world needs more kind loving people in positions of leadership. I wish you much success ? Congratulations, Amy, for the new position! I’m so excited for you! Now, to go back and read your newsletter, have a great summer ? Thank you, Ramona! Hope you have a great week! Congratulations on your promotion to AP. I’m sure you’ll be fabulous! Thank you, Marie! :) Leave a Reply This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.",

Leave your print books at home and read on your phone.  Libby works in conjunction with your local library card.  There are audio books and magazines as well (depends on your local library for the magazines).  I use Libby with an iPad at home, but when traveling, my phone works just fine.  Once the books are downloaded, you do not need a WiFi connection.
