  "description": "We recently got a question to the Hotline that asked about the proper time to make eggnog. I hope you’re sitting down, because my answer might surprise you: The best time to make the eggnog you’ll drink on Christmas is on Thanksgiving—or even Halloween. That’s right, the best nog is an aged nog. Wait, what? Why Would I Age Eggnog? The last few holiday seasons, my dad has become a bit of an “eggnog guy.” I shudder even typing those words. As soon as Thanksgiving ends, it's not uncommon to see him pre and/or post dinner with a hefty glass of store-bought eggnog spiked with cheap brandy. After trying a glass, I wrote off eggnog as a glass of thick, cloying dairy drink with a sharp sting of alcohol. That was until one year, as a treat, I decided to do some research and make him the ultimate homemade nog. I discovered that, in addition to whipping the eggs yourself, letting your eggnog age in the fridge for anywhere from 2 weeks to a few months was the surest way to make a cocktail that you won’t just be craving at the holidays, but almost every night.

I hope you’re sitting down, because my answer might surprise you: The best time to make the eggnog you’ll drink on Christmas is on Thanksgiving—or even Halloween. That’s right, the best nog is an aged nog. Wait, what? Why Would I Age Eggnog? The last few holiday seasons, my dad has become a bit of an “eggnog guy.” I shudder even typing those words. As soon as Thanksgiving ends, it's not uncommon to see him pre and/or post dinner with a hefty glass of store-bought eggnog spiked with cheap brandy. After trying a glass, I wrote off eggnog as a glass of thick, cloying dairy drink with a sharp sting of alcohol. That was until one year, as a treat, I decided to do some research and make him the ultimate homemade nog. I discovered that, in addition to whipping the eggs yourself, letting your eggnog age in the fridge for anywhere from 2 weeks to a few months was the surest way to make a cocktail that you won’t just be craving at the holidays, but almost every night. Aging your nog adds a deep complexity in flavor different from my previous overly heavy and sweet eggnog. Even more excitingly, it mellows out the harsh bite of the alcohol. And maybe the best part? You’ll have one less thing to prep during the busy weeks leading up to the holidays. The Science Now I know many of you are scrolling as fast as you can to the comments to ask about consuming raw eggs or to say that the drink will spoil after that long. And I'll say your hesitation is totally valid! The University of Minnesota estimates that 1 in every ~3,300 cartons of American eggs will contain some level of salmonella. And while I can’t 100%, fully guarantee that there is zero risk, Rockefeller University has run their own eggnog study that has shown that an eggnog with at least 20 percent alcohol by volume drastically diminishes your risk once it's been in the fridge for 24 hours. So don’t just trust me, trust the eggnog obsessed scientists! I find the best length of time for aging is anywhere between two weeks and two months, though there is a subset of nog-heads that make a batch on December 26th to be consumed the following Christmas. I urge you to experiment and find your happy medium. I drink mine within six months. Aging works for any eggnog recipe, but I find the best results come from combining the egg yolk, sugar, nutmeg, and alcohol, then storing that mixture and only adding the dairy on the day you intend to drink it. This will result in a more mellow, slightly fresher drinking experience. If you want to go the extra mile, freeze the egg whites you separate, and on the day you want to serve the nog, thaw them, whip them to stiff peaks, and whisk them into the eggnog for an extra luxurious holiday drinking experience. From Our Shop My Go To Recipe Separate a dozen eggs, freezing the egg whites. Whisk the yolks with 2 teaspoons of freshly grated nutmeg and 1lb (~ 2 ¼ cups) of sugar until the sugar is fully absorbed and the mixture has taken on a pale yellow color. Whisk in 3 cups of your preferred eggnog alcohol (I like equal parts bourbon, brandy, and dark rum). Place this mixture in an airtight container, and store in your fridge for two weeks to two months. The day before you want to drink, thaw your egg whites and whip to stiff peaks either with a hand mixer or with a stand mixer with a whisk attachment. In a large bowl, whisk together the aged mixture and a quart each of whole milk and heavy cream. Finally whisk in the egg whites until incorporated. Serve in chilled mugs and garnish with more nutmeg. Have more holiday entertaining questions? Ask away on our Hotline page or drop us a line at 1 (877)-52-HOTLINE",
