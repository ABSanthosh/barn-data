Or maybe you’re just looking for weeknight dinners that aren’t chicken—because, let’s be real, we could all use a little variety. Whatever the reason, we’ve rounded up 22 no-chicken, no-egg, and no-fuss recipes to try this week. This list has something for everyone: seafood, pork, beef, and plenty of plant-based options, too. Each recipe is weeknight friendly, meaning minimal dishes, short ingredient lists, and either quick-cook times or hands-off moments where the oven does the work. They require only a few dishes and a relatively small ingredient list. And bonus: They all reheat beautifully as leftovers. From Our Shop Baked Cod With Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto Flaky cod gets a thick layer of Pesto Rosso, flavored with rosemary, balsamic vinegar, and red pepper flakes. Don’t let the homemade pesto scare you—it can be made up to one week in advance, making this a true weeknight winner. Smoky Shrimp with Lemony Orzo, Green Olives \u0026 Feta This dish uses a quick marinade for the shrimp, which only needs to sit while you prep the other ingredients. If it’s warm enough to grill, you’ll get an extra smoky flavor, but a skillet sauté works just as well. Garlicky Salmon with Ginger, Lime \u0026 Peanuts Salmon is always a weeknight go-to in our books, but this version takes it up a notch. If your usual is a salmon-rice bowl, try this variation packed with fish sauce, peanuts, lime, and cilantro. Curry-Coconut Shrimp and Rice Salad with Pomegranate \u0026 Lime This dish looks impressive, but it’s all in the garnish. A couple of easy hacks boost flavor without adding cooking time—marinate the shrimp in a mix of curry powder, coconut milk, and lime juice, and cook the rice like pasta. Slow-Roasted Salmon with Kale, Chickpeas \u0026 Fried Lemon As the recipe’s author writes, this meal is totally weeknight-friendly, with plenty of hands-off time. Slow roasting is also a foolproof method if you’ve ever been burned by overcooked salmon. Bonus: It only requires about five main ingredients. Miso-Ginger Noodles With Tuna \u0026 Spicy Sesame Crumbs A low-effort, high-reward dinner. Once again, the umami-packed secret lies in the garnish of crispy bread crumbs, sesame seeds, and an easy miso-ginger dressing. Turkey Meatballs with Herby Ricotta These shortcut turkey meatballs don’t require eggs or much prep. Plus, they bake in the oven instead of frying (which sounds like more hands-off time for you). Stuffed Peppers with Orzo \u0026 Halloumi A fun twist on classic stuffed peppers. These call for ground lamb, but you can easily sub turkey (or any ground meat). The halloumi is a great choice, but mozzarella makes a solid swap. Beef Bowl with Cilantro Rice You don’t need grass-fed Aussie beef to make this burrito bowl shine. Elevate your rice with cilantro and a few seasonings, then pile on toppings like salsa, beans, or avocado. Sweet Potato Taco Soup Packed with flavor, veggies, and all the best taco components, this soup only needs about 25 minutes to simmer—just enough time to check off a few evening to-dos. Pan-Fried Pork Chops with Scallions \u0026 Broccoli A great weeknight stir-fry with a short ingredient list and even shorter cook time. Just mix up a quick sesame-soy sauce and pan-sear the pork chops. Loaded Sweet Potatoes Think of these as sweet potato nachos, piled high with chorizo (or any ground meat), queso fresco, and fresh herbs. One-Pot Pasta with Sausage \u0026 Peas Filling, flavorful, and endlessly customizable with whatever frozen veggies you have on hand (though we love the sausage and pea combo). A squeeze of lemon and splash of red wine vinegar add the perfect brightness. Sheet-Pan Pasta With Brussels Sprouts \u0026 Garlicky Walnut Crumbs If you’ve got an extra box of penne, try this unexpected sheet-pan pasta. Swap in squash, cabbage, or broccoli for the Brussels sprouts, but don’t skip the garlic-walnut breadcrumb topping. One-Pot Pasta with Tomato, Cheese \u0026 Shallots This one-pot dish is more than a recipe, it’s a formula for easy, flavorful pastas. It’s great in its simplest, saucy state, but bacon, sausage, or breadcrumbs would all make excellent additions. Baked Skillet Pasta This cozy skillet pasta is packed with goat cheese, mushrooms, and spinach, all coated in a fragrant brown butter sauce. It comes together in one skillet and only requires a few minutes under the broiler to crisp up the parmesan (though you could skip it to save time). Weeknight Ragù A quick and easy sauce that relies on good-quality tomatoes, onion, and fresh garlic. Pop open a bottle of red wine to brighten up the sauce (but remember to save a glass for yourself). Chickpea Salad with Fennel, Halloumi \u0026 Dill This chickpea salad from Nea in our Test Kitchen has been trending for good reason—it’s simple, quick, and perfect for busy weeknights. Inspired by Poppy’s in Brooklyn, it’s short on ingredients but big on flavor. Mushroom Lentil Tacos with Tahini-Yogurt Sauce Mix up taco night with these mushroom-lentil tacos. For an even faster cook time, use red or yellow lentils and pre-sliced mushrooms. Sheet-pan Miso tofu with brussels sprouts, apple \u0026 arugula Recipe author Emily Connor is the queen of delicious sheet-pan meals. This one combines soy-miso marinated tofu, Brussels sprouts, arugula, and apple for a mix of textures and flavors. Crunchy-Shell Cauliflower Tacos Another fun taco variation, these crunchy-shell cauliflower tacos leave lots of room for customization. Add hot sauce, avocado, and a dollop of sour cream for the perfect bite. Crispy Roasted Shallot and Lentil Sheet-Pan Mujadara Spiced with cumin, thyme, and lots of fresh herbs, this lentil dish takes a bit more time (about 1 hour, 20 minutes), but most of it is hands-off. The recipe also includes a great preheated pan hack for getting the crispiest shallots. What are your go-to weeknight meals? Let us know in the comments.",
