While there are countless items to consider for your emergency bag, one particular set of supplies you’ll want to prioritize are the groceries that’ll keep you fed and hydrated.First, get your equipment ready.  What good is a can of chicken soup if you can’t open it? That’s why, before you pack an emergency food supply, it’s important to include the basic tools needed to access your meals and keep them from spoiling. For starters, Hoch recommends packing a can opener and a knife for your tinned and packaged goods. It’s also a good idea to have an insulated water bottle and portable water filters to stay hydrated. Evans emphasizes the importance of insulated cooler bags and ice packs if you plan on traveling with perishable foods or beverages. “Cold perishable foods should be kept at or below 40°F to slow bacterial growth and help prevent foodborne illness,” says the food safety expert.Canned foods are always helpful.“If accessing food and preparing meals becomes challenging, it’s important to have energy-dense, nutrient-rich, shelf-stable foods readily available,” Hoch says. For the most part, you may be able to raid your pantry for cans to keep in an emergency bag, but before rushing to do so, it’s important to know which ones are the best to grab. First, start with protein sources like tuna, chicken, salmon, or chickpeas, she says. Then, you’ll want to consider fruits and vegetables and try to stock up on options like green beans, carrots, peaches, or pears. Don’t forget about your milk either; you can grab cans of coconut or evaporated milk, too. Lastly, she recommends grabbing a bunch of soups or stews since those can act as complete meals.Make sure you’re grabbing items that’ll keep you hydrated. Your first thought might be water when considering how to stay hydrated during an emergency, but plenty of other options can also quench your thirst. Coconut water, for example, is packed with electrolytes and helps keep your body hydrated, Hoch says. Additionally, there are many fresh, non-refrigerated foods you can stock up on, such as watermelon, oranges, grapes, cucumbers, and peppers — all of which keep you from feeling thirsty. Don’t forget to get a bunch of snacks and comfort foods, too. “During stressful times, certain foods contain compounds and nutrients that can help promote calmness,” Hoch says. She recommends stocking up on herbal teas like chamomile and lavender, which are known for their soothing effects. Foods rich in magnesium, such as bananas, dark chocolate, and nuts and seeds, can also support mental wellness and relaxation, she explains. Evans adds that if the situation looks serious, you should prioritize snacks that don’t require refrigeration in case you need to evacuate or the power goes out. Her top picks include peanut butter, jelly, crackers, granola bars, dried fruit, jerky, and trail mix. It’s natural for your nervous system to feel shaken during a natural disaster, but with the right preparation, you can reduce some of that stress, knowing you’ve taken steps to protect yourself and your loved ones.",
