Our Hotline producer recently did a deep dive on all things sourdough, answering any lingering questions you might have about creating your own starter or where to buy one. As someone who barely knew the basics but suddenly found my feed flooded with fermentation updates, I was shocked to learn that sourdough starter isn’t just for bread—the options are truly endless. Pancakes, English muffins, brown butter cookies? Yep. Pizza dough, cinnamon rolls, even dog treats? Absolutely. If you’ve got an active starter, or discard, here’s how to put it to work. We rounded up 24 sourdough baking recipes (and even a salad dressing) to elevate your charcuterie spreads, brunches, and more. Sourdough starter is a living culture that needs regular feeding. When you refresh it, you remove a portion—this is called discard. While some people toss it, but that’s a waste of potential deliciousness. Discard still has all that tangy flavor and works beautifully in baked goods, adding depth without extra leavening. Many of the recipes below make use of it. 1. Sourdough Pancakes Light, fluffy, and with a subtle tang, these are the ultimate weekend breakfast upgrade. 2. Sourdough Bagels What’s better than homemade bagels? Homemade sourdough bagels. 3. Sourdough Cinnamon Rolls The sourdough flavor perfectly balances the sweet cinnamon filling—these are next-level brunch material. 4. Chocolate chip cookies Rich, buttery cookies with a hint of sourdough complexity. This might just be the best chocolate chip cookie recipes. 5. Crackers Super crispy, super easy—perfect for cheese boards or snacking straight from the jar. 6. Sourdough Pizza Dough That crispy, chewy crust you love? Even better with a little sourdough depth. 7. Sourdough Dog Treats Yes, even your pup can get in on the sourdough fun. 8. Avocado Toast A classic, but with homemade sourdough and little fresh mint—it’s next-level good. 9. Radicchio Salad with Sourdough Dressing Put your leftover sourdough to good work with this creative salad dressing. Yes, this requires baking a loaf, or having one on hand, but it’s worth it! 10. Pesto Knots Soft, garlicky, and twisted with basil pesto—so snackable. 11. Drop Biscuits Flaky, buttery, and somehow even better than classic biscuits with a little sourdough magic. 12. Corn Fritters Crispy edges, soft centers, and that sweet-savory combo. 13. Sourdough French Toast A custardy, crispy-edged delight that makes something new out of sourdough. 14. Apple Cider Doughnuts Fall flavors + sourdough = a match made in heaven. 15. Sourdough Croissants Flaky, airy layers infused with a slight sourdough tang—totally worth the effort. 16. Naan Pillowy soft and perfect for pairing with your favorite curry or hummus. 17. Cheddar \u0026 Chive Rolls Savory, cheesy, and ideal for soup-dipping. 18. Bread Pudding Sourdough takes this comforting dessert to the next level. 19. Hamburger Buns Because homemade burger night deserves homemade buns. 20. Lavender Vanilla Cupcakes The perfect spring dessert (or for when you’re dreaming of warming weather). Turn your discard into these lemony-lavender cupcakes. 21. Kanelstang Inspired by a Danish kanelstang, or “cinnamon stick,” which is similar to an American-style cinnamon roll in dough and flavor. 22. Sourdough Waffles Another great recipe to impress (yourself or others) the next time brunch rolls around. 23. Breadsticks (Grissini) Homemade grissini—essentially Italian-style breadsticks—are an easy upgrade to any dinner table. Try making them with your starter or discard. 24. Sourdough Mazanec Mazanec is a traditional Czech Easter bread. This version is studded with almonds and dried fruit, with a golden, sugar-dusted crust—perfect for breakfast or an afternoon treat.
