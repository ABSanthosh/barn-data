Credit...Rinne Allen for The New York TimesWith funding from the candy giant Mars, scientists at the University of Georgia are genetically designing a peanut that can thrive in a changing climate.At the Wild Peanut Lab at the University of Georgia, the search is on for the perfect peanut. Credit...Rinne Allen for The New York TimesKim SeversonKim Severson attended peanut school at the University of Georgia Wild Peanut Lab to research this article.July 24, 2025The Peanut M\u0026M was in trouble. It was the early 2000s, and complaints about rancid nuts were piling up at Mars headquarters in McLean, Va., so fast they had outpaced the combined consumer complaints about Snickers, Twix and even the company’s extensive dog food line.So the world’s largest confectionary company went hunting for a new peanut to solve the problem.Plant breeders had discovered a genetic mutation that produced peanuts with plenty of monounsaturated fat, like the kind found in olive oil. That meant they were healthier and less likely to turn rancid. It was a start, but Mars — a company that refers to the peanut as its “hero ingredient” — needed more.They wanted a peanut that was perfectly symmetrical with sweet, roasted notes. It had to stay crunchy inside a ball of chocolate, and have a skin that kept it from splitting and was a touch bitter to balance the sweetness. It had to grow so well in the Southern peanut belt that farmers would be willing to switch out their tried and true seeds for something new.Peanut researchers at the University of Georgia got to work and created the Georgia-09B, a runner peanut that did everything the candy maker wanted. By 2017, Mars was using nothing but high-oleic peanuts in its M\u0026Ms, most of them Georgia-09Bs.“Since then, customer complaints have reduced by over 90 percent,” said Peggy Tsatsos, who leads research for the Mars nut science team.Now, with $3.5 million from Mars, scientists at the university’s Wild Peanut Lab are trying to help Mars out of another jam.This time, it’s a race against a fast-changing climate that has brought waves of disease and pests that threaten the world’s peanut supply.“We are super happy with the flavor we got but now it’s how do we make sure we have enough of those?” said Amanda Davies, the chief research and development, procurement and sustainability officer for Mars Snacking. “About 30 percent of all peanuts never make it from the pod to the plate and the situation is getting worse as more crops are lost to disease.”ImageThe Wild Peanut Lab at the University of Georgia has thousands of seed samples.Credit...Rinne Allen for The New York TimesMars, which introduced Peanut M\u0026Ms in 1954, buys more than 300 million pounds of peanuts each year. That’s about the weight of 350 fully loaded 747s. Most are for Snickers, which requires 16 skinless split peanuts for each regular size bar. Only about 1 percent of peanuts grown globally qualify to fill an M\u0026M.More resilient peanuts could save American farmers millions of dollars in lost crops. So, the work of the Wild Peanut Lab is to cross breed the right genes and come up with peanuts that are essentially immune to the ravages of nature.“If we can get double the yield from the same amount of land and reduce inputs this helps the farmer and helps in allowing us to pursue that perfect peanut,” Ms. Davies said.Already, some of the lab’s work has produced a peanut plant that can grow in Georgia fields infested with nematodes, a worm that can kill more than half a farmer’s crop.The work has global implications, too. In Senegal, newer, disease-resistant peanut plants are growing that produce a larger number of green leaves that can be used to feed livestock once the peanuts are dug from the earth. For farmers who don’t spray chemicals on peanut crops, especially small farmers in poorer countries, a more resilient peanut could double their crop.“Right now one of the things that we know is we need more peanuts, and Africa has a great supply base,” Dr. Tsatsos said.ImageAt the Wild Peanut Lab, doctoral students investigate pollen fertility and disease resistance, among other subjects.Credit...Rinne Allen for The New York TimesImagePeanut leaf specimens get tested to see how well they resist disease and pests.Credit...Rinne Allen for The New York TimesThe company also supports projects in countries such as Brazil, China and Nicaragua. Each locale has different soil conditions and weather patterns, and farmers with their own ideas about what’s best for their fields. They aren’t all growing peanuts just to sell to Mars but will benefit all the same from the work in the Wild Peanut Lab, she said.The secret weapon is the wild peanut itself, whose resilient genes can lead to disease-resistant, high-yielding commercial cultivars. The process used to take decades, but in 2019 an international consortium of researchers led by the University of Georgia and funded with help from Mars was able to map the surprisingly complex peanut genome. That sped up the breeding process, allowing scientists to easily pinpoint the genes responsible for traits like drought tolerance, high oleic acid content or flavor.No one knows more about wild peanut genes than David and Soraya Bertioli, a couple who in 2013 moved from Brazil to Georgia to start the Wild Peanut Lab.Their deep knowledge of the wild genetic ancestors of the modern peanut was key to the genome mapping project. Like homicide detectives on a cold case, they devoted themselves to tracing wild peanut samples collected in 1934 by an army medic in rural Bolivia. By following a genetic trail, they discovered that over centuries the disease-resistant genes from that wild peanut — call it Peanut X — had made their way into 251 cultivated peanut varieties being grown in 29 countries.ImageDavid and Soraya Bertioli run a collection of greenhouses, test plots and research space in a corner of the University of Georgia campus called the Wild Peanut Lab.Credit...Rinne Allen for The New York Times“The wild peanut is so small and so unproductive. They’re like weeds. Nobody cares about them,” Soraya Bertioli said. “But they are very, very, very good because they are like vaccines. They have the genes that will make the peanut resistant.”As one of the largest privately held companies in the United States, Mars approaches agricultural research differently than many corporations. Like open-source software, the information its research produces is available for anyone to use or share with no patents or intellectual property rights standing in the way. The company has invested in similar research in cacao and mint, two other crops Mars cannot survive without.It’s the way Forrest Mars, Sr., the billionaire who invented M\u0026Ms, would have wanted it, Mars scientists say. In 1947 he declared mutuality — the idea that Mars’s success should also benefit others — as one of the company’s five core principles. It still guides the company, which had nearly $50 billion in sales in 2024. And it’s why they are all in on the Wild Peanut Lab.Kim Severson is an Atlanta-based reporter who covers the nation’s food culture and contributes to NYT Cooking.Related ContentAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT",

By following a genetic trail, they discovered that over centuries the disease-resistant genes from that wild peanut — call it Peanut X — had made their way into 251 cultivated peanut varieties being grown in 29 countries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"ImageBlock-13\"\u003e\u003cfigure aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"photoviewer-children-figure\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eImage\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption data-testid=\"photoviewer-children-caption\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDavid and Soraya Bertioli run a collection of greenhouses, test plots and research space in a corner of the University of Georgia campus called the Wild Peanut Lab.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCredit...\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan aria-hidden=\"false\"\u003eRinne Allen for The New York Times\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"companionColumn-7\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The wild peanut is so small and so unproductive. They’re like weeds. Nobody cares about them,” Soraya Bertioli said. “But they are very, very, very good because they are like vaccines. They have the genes that will make the peanut resistant.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs one of the largest privately held companies in the United States, Mars approaches agricultural research differently than many corporations. Like open-source software, the information its research produces is available for anyone to use or share with no patents or intellectual property rights standing in the way. The company has invested in similar research in cacao and mint, two other crops Mars cannot survive without.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s the way Forrest Mars, Sr., the billionaire who invented M\u0026amp;Ms, would have wanted it, Mars scientists say. In 1947 he declared mutuality — the idea that Mars’s success should also benefit others — as one of the company’s five core principles. It still guides the company, which had nearly $50 billion in sales in 2024.
