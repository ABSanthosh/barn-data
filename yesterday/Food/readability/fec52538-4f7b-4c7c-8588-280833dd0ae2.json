  "text": "A peek at everything I loved in July 2025! FOOD Chobani s’mores creamer. This is the best flavored creamer I’ve ever had in my life. Thank goodness pumpkin comes next because I’ll be sad when I run out! Trader Joe’s aglio olio seasoning. We FLY through this seasoning. I love it on just about anything! It has a little kick and it’s so great. Brightland squeezeable olive oil. I adore brightland olive oil and was so excited to get it in a squeeze bottle. They are all I use now! HOME Mini travel white noise. I never thought I’d be a white noise person, but as a parent I’ve slept with a monitor on with some white noise now for almost 10 years! I loved having this for travel. Handheld mini fan. Never leave home without it. Never! Smeg kitchen scale. We go through kitchen scales like crazy. They’ve always been flat digital scales and that works great for my sourdough. But I LOVE this smeg one. I love that it’s a bowl! I can put things directly into it and it is so pretty to look at. I don’t mind leaving it out. BEAUTY Kosas blush in Heartbeat. I am a blush fanatic. It’s my favorite thing to try. This shade is stunning. It screams summer! It’s like a bright coral red, but very flattering and wearable. Conair ceramic hot rollers. I’ve been a hot rollers girl my whole life – velcro rollers make my hair so frizzy! And they also rip my hair out. Nothing holds a curl like these. Olehenriksen peach glaze lip treatment. This is SO comfortable on the lips that I can’t be without it. I have one everywhere. FASHION Hat clip. I use this for my cuyana visor almost every day! Strappy nude slides. I’ve wanted a pair of strappy flat sandals in nude and these are SO comfortable. I love this brand for comfort. Naghedi small St Bart’s tote. I’ve tried all the dupes for naghedi and nothing is as good as the real thing. It’s so stretchy and beautiful. This is my summer crossbody and I love it. So chic. Scalloped dress shorts. This is the first time I’ve actually tried shorts under a dress (like the short nap dress!) and why haven’t I always been doing this?! MEDIA The Summer I Turned Pretty. It’s just a comfort show for me! I can watch it over and over again. I read the books so I know what happens and I don’t wonder what if! Broken Country. Oh my gosh – this book gutted me. I loved it and couldn’t stop thinking about it. Ina’s mini cooper ride playlist. This is so fabulous from the queen herself. KIDS Adidas lite racer 7.0 sneakers. Max has loved these shoes for years but now Emilia and Jordan have a pair. They all love them! Aqua shark handheld game. Jordan LOVES this little retro game. It’s great for dinners out too. Paint by number canvas. Emilia’s current favorite craft. She has done one of these every week! Perfectly Logical brainteasers. We have had so much fun doing these together. I love this book.
