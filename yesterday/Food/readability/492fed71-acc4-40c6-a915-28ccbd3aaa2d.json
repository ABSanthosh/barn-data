  "text": "Hi friends, happy Sunday! This weekend marks a particular anniversary in my aging journey: my 44th birthday. I can already tell this is the era when I start forgetting how old I actually am, because I nearly introduced myself as 45 the other day without blinking. One thing that truly delights me about getting older is the way our personalities branch off into little side quests. You know what I mean? The hyper-specific hobbies or obsessions that slowly become part of who we are. As my latest side quest, I’ve fully embodied a Pool Dad. I clean the pool myself, I buy the chemicals, I have strong opinions about skimmer baskets, and yes, I will confidently explain how to backwash a filter to anyone who will listen. Pool Dad insists that with the slightest hint of sunshine, everyone must get in the pool. And honestly, as a Pool Father,  I get it. Chlorine doesn’t grow on trees. (Something a Pool Dad would say.) So if I can get the pool pH to a peaceful place by the Sunday afternoon, there will be people swimming. There better be. That is both an invitation and a threat. I hope this finds you happily side questing in your own way. Now, to the link I’ve gathered this week! •  Are you team Make Your Own Birthday Cake or do you prefer to be baked for?  I always make my own cake (mostly because the only person who has offered to bake one for me is my girl Suzonne with her famous coconut cake).  This year’s cake is but Perfect Chocolate Bundt Cake but My 12 Best Birthday Cakes is a solid list if you have a Gemini to bake for.  (Instagram, Joy the Baker) •  This one hit deep.

In Bellville, banners of the town’s soldiers line Main Street . It’s a good time to pause, to honor those we’ve lost, and to appreciate the sacrifice of so many families . I hope your weekend ahead is filled with sunshine, rest, and a moment or two of remembrance. With love from the pool, xo Joy 16 Responses Buc-ee’s supports political candidates I do not, so I won’t spend money there, but it’s free just to look (or use the bathroom)! Pool Dad! I love it! I did that stint for a while. We moved to a house in Little Hocking, Ohio, ages ago. It had a pool that had been covered for a decade. It had almost as much water on top of the cover as below. After I fished out the dead mice and squirrels (gross,gross,gross!), and unceremoniously evicted the frogs, off came the cover and I became Pool Dad. I did the fix the filter pump, research the chemicals and all that. I tended that like a baby. Cleaning and skimming. I watched that thermometer for weeks. I don’t remember what time it happened, but the air was so hot, I was doing all my pool work in a bikini (before kids.) I had Mondays off, so I was out there while hubby was at work, enjoying myself. I checked the thermometer and the water finally hit 50 degrees. That sounds warm, doesn’t it, after a long cold winter. So, off the diving board, I went, into the deep end. The shock nearly stopped my heart!!! My whole body went into panic mode. All I could think was how awful it would be for hubby to find me drown in the pool that fine sunny day! In what seemed like a hour, I reached the other end of the pool and crawled out. I learned a lot about pools that year. Most importantly, that 50 degrees is not warm enough to swim in! ? Other that that, we really enjoyed that pool. In all the intervening years, we’ve never had another one. Enjoy yours to the fullest! Wishing you a very happy birthday – love your posts! Thank you, Shelly! Happy Birthday Joy – totally with you on the ‘I make my own birthday cake’ plan Wish it was pool weather way up the east coast but it will come It will come, Julie! Thank you for the birthday wishes! Oh my gosh…you Pood Dad personna should be in one of those Progressive Insurance ads that makes fun of young people turning into their parents. I have the scenerio already in my head! That said, enjoy your pool. You certainly got a LOT for your money when you purchased your beautiful home. Hahahha! I can totally see it, Nancy! Spot on and highly accurate. You are a fantastic interviewer. I love the series of your questions-unique, complimenting the person, captures my interest every time! Ah that’s really kind Cheryl! I’m so glad you enjoy them! We stopped at a Buc-ees once on a trip in 2018 and my husband is obsessed! I don’t recall the bathroom art but there is an amazing camaraderie that exists when people wearing Buc-ees merch here in MI see each other in public. Hahaha! The Buc-eess merch worn outside of Texas really does hit. That NYT article about GenX creative career meltdowns was harrowing. At least the food field seems safe — for now at least. Joy, have you ever told the story of how you and Will met? I thought it might come up in the blog posts surrounding your wedding, but I can’t recall you ever talking about it. I believe she has posted that they met at a party here in New Orleans. Thanks, I guess I missed that! Harrowing is definitely the right word for it! And yes – I talked about meeting Will and our little love story here! Leave a Reply This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.",

I love it! I did that stint for a while. We moved to a house in Little Hocking, Ohio, ages ago. It had a pool that had been covered for a decade. It had almost as much water on top of the cover as below. After I fished out the dead mice and squirrels (gross,gross,gross!), and unceremoniously evicted the frogs, off came the cover and I became Pool Dad. I did the fix the filter pump, research the chemicals and all that. I tended that like a baby. Cleaning and skimming. I watched that thermometer for weeks. I don’t remember what time it happened, but the air was so hot, I was doing all my pool work in a bikini (before kids.) I had Mondays off, so I was out there while hubby was at work, enjoying myself. I checked the thermometer and the water finally hit 50 degrees. That sounds warm, doesn’t it, after a long cold winter. So, off the diving board, I went, into the deep end. The shock nearly stopped my heart!!! My whole body went into panic mode. All I could think was how awful it would be for hubby to find me drown in the pool that fine sunny day! In what seemed like a hour, I reached the other end of the pool and crawled out. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI learned a lot about pools that year. Most importantly, that 50 degrees is not warm enough to swim in! ? Other that that, we really enjoyed that pool. In all the intervening years, we’ve never had another one.
