While the budget still needs to be approved by the Senate to take full effect, many are expressing their concerns about the proposed budget cuts.Here’s everything you need to know about SNAP, the proposed budget cuts, and how it might affect the way Americans shop. What Is SNAP?SNAP is a federally funded benefits program designed to help low-income American families buy food. To receive SNAP benefits, you must meet certain eligibility requirements. From there, recipients receive an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) card and are allotted a certain monthly amount to spend on groceries. The amount is automatically loaded onto the EBT card monthly and can be used at participating grocery stores, farmers markets, and even some restaurants. There are some limitations however. SNAP benefits can be used to buy your standard groceries — including fruits and vegetables, meat, dairy products, breads, and grains. They cannot be used to buy alcohol, cigarettes, tobacco, vitamins, or household or cleaning supplies. SNAP is one of the most effective tools to fight hunger and food insecurity (defined as when one lacks access to affordable, healthy food to meet their basic needs) in this country. Roughly 41 million Americans rely on SNAP to supplement their monthly grocery budgets. What Are the Proposed Cuts?The House Republicans’ budget is aimed at cutting spending in key areas as a way to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This would result in an additional $4.5 trillion in spending, and the tax benefits would primarily be distributed to wealthy, high-income earners. To make room for these tax benefits, the suggested budget would slash more than $230 billion from the SNAP program through 2034. (The budget also proposes $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, causing nearly 36 million Americans to potentially lose their health care coverage.) What Does This Mean? To pass, the budget needs to be approved at the Senate level, where Republicans need a simple majority. If the cuts were to go into effect, roughly 9 million low-income Americans could lose access to their SNAP benefits, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Simply put, they would struggle to afford groceries and go hungry. Stricter work eligibility requirements may also take effect, resulting in some SNAP recipients seeing their monthly benefits slashed in half or being eliminated altogether. Why It Matters At a time when inflation is high and grocery prices have skyrocketed (look at the price of eggs for example), these cuts could make life more difficult for people. Having previously worked with SNAP recipients firsthand, the cuts would slash the budgets of hardworking people (many with multiple jobs) already struggling to make ends meet.Chef Greg Silverman, CEO and executive director of West Side Campaign Against Hunger (WSCAH), a food pantry in New York City, sees this impact every day. In fact, the pantry is currently observing worse numbers than it did during the peak of the pandemic. The team at WSCAH helps food-insecure New Yorkers by providing healthy fresh food and assistance signing up for benefits like SNAP.  “The situation in NYC continues to get worse and worse. With stagnating city and state dollars and potential massive SNAP cuts being pushed nationally, for those in need, the future is grim. Already we are at a point where the SNAP minimum for a single adult, such as a senior citizen, is only $23 per month!” Silverman says. In addition, $23 is hardly enough money for a day’s worth of food, especially in New York City. In many cases, SNAP might be some people’s only means of getting access to fresh produce, especially if they live in an area affected by food apartheid (neighborhoods where fast food is plentiful while grocery stores selling fresh produce are not.) Food insecurity rates could also rise, not only affecting those in need, but stretching the budgets of organizations like WSCAH that support them. Silverman adds, “Continued rising food prices generally have forced WSCAH to spend a million more dollars on food this year. Our community members in need need more support, not less.”",
