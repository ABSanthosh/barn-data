But, the right side dishes can also balance its richness, from bright citrusy salads to creamy potatoes and hearty grains. Below, you’ll find more than 40 of the best side dishes for lamb—no matter how you like to cook it. Arguably one of the greatest lamb scenes in cinema (is this something people argue about?) comes by way of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, the 2002 rom-com that had a $5 million budget but went on to gross over $240 million. Protagonist, Toula, is introducing her boyfriend to her family when she has to break the news that he’s a vegetarian. Her aunt is horrified. “What do you mean he don’t eat no meat?” she screams. The room goes silent. But then, her aunt realizes a solution: “That’s okay, that’s okay,” she says, squeezing his cheeks. “I make lamb!” But what will she make to go with the lamb? This is important. Lamb works just as well with minerally, bitter ingredients as mild, sweet ones—the tough part is knowing how to narrow down. Luckily, we have some ideas. Below are some of the very best side dishes for lamb. Jump to: Fresh \u0026 Bright Asparagus Sides for Lamb Bitter \u0026 Bold Veggie Sides to Balance Rich Lamb Sweet \u0026 Savory Carrot Sides That Complement Lamb Homemade Buttery, Fluffy Dinner Rolls Peas of All Kinds The Best Potato Sides to Serve With Lamb Quick \u0026 Easy Radish Recipes to Try With Lamb Feta-Laced Salads That Pair Beautifully With Lamb Updated in April 2025 to include even more delicious side dishes to serve with lamb—because you can never have too many options. Fresh \u0026 Bright Asparagus Sides for Lamb 1. Shaved Asparagus \u0026 Arugula Salad A simple, yet impressive side that proves asparagus doesn’t always need to be cooked. In fact, with a rich protein like lamb, leaving it raw—shaved into ribbons like pappardelle—is a great match. 2. Pan-Roasted Asparagus with Brown Butter, Lemon \u0026 Eggs Mimosa When smooshed through a fine-mesh sieve, hard-boiled eggs turn into fluffy snow. Here, that falls on brown buttered asparagus, but don’t hesitate to try this on any green vegetable. 3. Absurdly Addictive Asparagus This addictive roasted asparagus recipe is a top 10 favorite, featuring pancetta, leeks, garlic, and citrus zest—a deliciously savory side dish for roast lamb or grilled lamb chops. 4. Shaved Asparagus \u0026 Mint Salad Instead of the old-school mint jelly, try serving lamb with fresh mint, in one way or another. Here, it’s an herby salad with Parmesan and hazelnuts. 5. Crispy Chickpea Fattoush with Asparagus and Radishes Recipe developer EmilyC offers up a foolproof fattoush formula: crispy pita + vegetables + herbs + dressing. This version here with translucent-crisp radishes, quickly toasted asparagus, and heaps (heaps!) of fresh dill will bounce some spring into your lamb’s step. 6. Asparagus With Soft-Boiled Eggs \u0026 Anchovy Bread Crumbs Barely blanched asparagus gets dotted with oozy eggs, crispy crunchy 'chovy crumbs, and fruity Calabrian chile. I estimate a pound (yes, a pound!) of springtime goodness per person, but feel free to halve or quarter the serving size if serving as a side. 7. Pea, Asparagus, \u0026 Avocado Salad With Burrata This lovely, fraîche salad from A Cozy Kitchen features crisp butter lettuce leaves, tender asparagus stems, and snappy peas tossed in a yogurt dressing and served with a ball of burrata. Dairy on dairy? Yes, please. 8. Tagliarini with Asparagus and Herbs From Ruth Rogers of the beloved River Cafe London comes this recipe for creamy, herby pasta with asparagus. The asparagus are cut to the same thickness as the pasta, making for surprising bites (is it pasta or is it asparagus?) we just can’t pull our forks away from. Bitter \u0026 Bold Veggie Sides to Balance Rich Lamb 1. Charred Radicchio With Arugula, Cherries \u0026 Parmesan Sorta counterintuitively, charring radicchio undermines its bitterness. Cherries and balsamic add sweetness, while arugula and black pepper bring spice. 2. Broccoli Rabe in Lemon Cream This dish made our co-founder Amanda Hesser look at broccoli rabe in a brand new way. And yes, you should give the lemon-cream treatment to other bitter things, like radicchio or escarole. 3. Marinated White Bean \u0026 Radicchio Salad A heavy-on-the-Pecorino salad for any season. If you can’t find oversize gigante or corona beans (psst: you can order online from Rancho Gordo), opt for cannellini. 4. Broccoli Rabe Goma-ae A simple broccoli rabe salad that’s all about the sesame seeds. Soy sauce adds salty-savoriness and a pinch of sugar keeps everything even-keeled. 5. Berardino’s Crispy Pancotto Add this to your list of “Ways to Use Up Stale Bread.” With garlic, chiles, and lots of olive oil, it’s reminiscent of a greens-stuffed, crispy-bottomed bread pudding. 6. Fall Salad with Lemony Brown Butter Vinaigrette Fall, shmall. Carrots are technically a spring vegetable, too! A head of treviso, fluffy herbs, and beady lentils get tossed in a cumin- and fennel-spiced vinaigrette. 7. Union Square Café’s Hashed Brussels Sprouts with Poppy Seeds \u0026 Lemon This Genius recipe, comes to us from beloved N.Y.C. institution, Union Square Café. Raw and roasted brussels are hashed and tossed in a bright, nutty, fruity dressing. Topped with a fried egg, this would also make for a wonderful light main. 8. Roasted Brussels Sprouts With Pears \u0026 Pistachios Our readers voted this recipe “Our Best Green Holiday Side,” which means you can keep it on rotation from Easter through Thanksgiving. 9. Roasted Spring Root Vegetables with Horseradish-Thyme Butter Spring root vegetables get deep, caramelized flavor from roasting, while horseradish butter adds just the right kick—an easy, earthy match for lamb. 10. Chopped Radicchio Salad With Sourdough Croutons This chopped radicchio salad from Ella Henry combines crisp, slightly bitter greens with crunchy sourdough croutons for a satisfying texture contrast (a great way to use up a day-old loaf). Tossed in a simple, tangy vinaigrette, it’s a refreshing and easily customizable. Sweet \u0026 Savory Carrot Sides That Complement Lamb 1. Pomegranate Roasted Carrots Think of pomegranate molasses as the easiest glaze your carrots will ever meet. Not to mention, the fruitiest and tangiest, to boot. 2. Sweet Smoky Roasted Carrots Sweet from honey (maple syrup would also be lovely), smoky from smoked paprika. Dorie Greenspan dreamed up this recipe for her book Everyday Dorie. 3. Buttery Maple Cumin Carrots Cumin seeds and coriander seeds team up with maple syrup–smooched carrots. We wouldn’t complain if you sprinkled some fresh herbs on top, like cilantro, dill, and/or mint. 4. Carrots Cooked Forever Carrots, but with the tenderness and silkiness of mashed potatoes. You might be tempted to skimp on the olive oil. Don’t. 5. Golden Carrot Souffle Despite how intimidating making a soufflé may seem, you don’t have to worry about this one collapsing mid-bake. Carrot purée is whipped with egg whites, sugar, and vanilla to create a sweet, airy mixture that’s then baked. If you’re looking for a spring side dish to serve with lamb, this is it. Homemade Buttery, Fluffy Dinner Rolls 1. Classic Dinner Rolls I know I said no holiday feast is complete without mashed potatoes, but it’s really incomplete without at least one basket of dinner rolls (but ideally there’s one at each end of the dinner table and a backup batch warming in the oven). There are so many variations of dinner rolls, but these are as classic as it gets. 2. Milk Buns with Salted Maple Butter These milk buns are soft, fluffy, and irresistible, with just the right balance of sweetness. Topped with a rich salted maple butter, they’re the perfect accompaniment to roasted lamb. Peas of All Kinds 1. Peas in Mint Cream The title just told you most of the ingredients in this fuss-free recipe. Feel free to swap in frozen peas; just adjust the cook time accordingly. 2. Pea Salad With Parmesan \u0026 Mint Peas can be salad, too. Here, they’re dressed up with fresh mint, lemon juice, and shaved Parmesan (a vegetable peeler is up for the task). 3. Creamy Watercress, Pea \u0026 Mint Soup As bright and happy as soup gets. If you can’t find watercress, feel free to swap in spinach (yes, frozen works!). This plus roast lamb plus bread would be a dream. 4. Radish, Snap Pea \u0026 Burrata Salad With Chives \u0026 Lemon Creamy burrata can’t get enough of perky-crunchy vegetables, like snap peas and radishes. Mozzarella works in a pinch. The Best Potato Sides to Serve With Lamb 1. Garlicky Roasted Potato Salad Lamb loves garlic almost as much as I do. This roasted-not-boiled potato salad uses four cloves, which you could certainly increase if you dare. 2. Squashed Potatoes Squashed is usually an unfortunate fate, but in this case, it’s a blessing. The potatoes become exceptionally crispy with irregular, craggy edges. 3. Medley of Roasted Potatoes With Homemade Za’atar \u0026 Aleppo Pepper Za’atar is a spice blend, fragrant with thyme, sumac, and sesame seeds. Here, it’s a superpower for roasted potatoes (assorted colors are pretty but not necessary). 4. Potatoes a la Lyonnaise “What can you say about a simple potato dish that goes with everything?” Mimi Thorisson writes. “Everything” obviously includes lamb, lamb, and more lamb. 5. Scalloped Potatoes with Caramelized Onions These scalloped potatoes are so not your grandmother’s, but even she might admit they’re better. In between layers of sliced potatoes, cheese, and a rich béchamel sauce are sweet caramelized onions. 6. Instant Pot Buttermilk \u0026 Leek Mashed Potatoes Yes, every holiday feast should have mashed potatoes. Sorry, I don’t make the rules (okay, maybe in this case I will declare one spud-tastic rule, but everyone will be better off for it). But if you’re bored of a classic mashed potato side dish, try this: Yukon gold potatoes and leeks, pressure cooked and then mashed with buttermilk and heavy cream. 7. Sweet Potatoes Roasted in Coconut Oil Of course, you’d expect to find a sweet potato dish on the table for Thanksgiving but it’s not exactly a side dish that comes to mind for roast lamb. By roasting the orange-hued taters with coconut oil, they take on an even lighter, sweeter flavor that just makes sense for spring dinners. Quick \u0026 Easy Radish Recipes to Try With Lamb 1. Radish Salad With Anchovy Sauce Anchovies underscore lamb’s savoriness. In this salad—with raw radishes, capers, and parsley—all you need is one tiny fish. 2. Pan-Braised Radishes \u0026 Greens The next time you pick up a bunch of radishes with their greens still attached, don’t throw those greens out. Instead, whip up this cheerful braise with butter and tarragon. 3. Roasted Radishes With Almond Salsa Verde Roasting renders radishes caramelized and fork-tender. This oregano-y almond salsa verde is the perfect teammate (awesome with just about any roasted vegetable, too). 4. Radish \u0026 Pecan Grain Salad The key to this chewy-crunchy salad is mixed grains—say farro and quinoa or rice and wheat berries. This component adds loads of texture and nuttiness. Feta-Laced Salads That Pair Beautifully With Lamb 1. Herb Salad With Chickpeas \u0026 Feta The more types of herbs, the better. Make sure you buy feta in a block (preferably in brine), then crumble it yourself; its flavor and consistency are way more delicious. 2. Wilted Escarole With Feta, Walnuts \u0026 Honey Escarole is bitterish, yes. That’s where the fatty walnuts and sticky-sweet honey come in. Don’t hold back on the latter. 3. Lemony Green Bean Salad With Feta, Red Onion \u0026 Marjoram A salad that’s full of lamb’s favorite words: lemon, feta, onion, marjoram (or, if you can’t find it, oregano—another favorite word). 4. Shaved Broccoli Stalk Salad With Soft Feta \u0026 Golden Raisins Broccoli stalks, now full of purpose. This would be dreamy alongside (or piled on top of!) juicy-rare lamb chops. 5. Pita Panzanella with Sumac \u0026 Feta Cheese This bright, herby fattoush is the perfect match for lamb—it’s loaded with crunchy pita, tangy sumac, and salty feta, all of which balance the richness of the meat. The fresh greens and juicy tomatoes add a refreshing contrast, making every bite feel light yet satisfying. 6. Shaved Fennel Feta Salad Spring means lamb, and lamb loves fennel. This crisp, citrusy salad cuts through the meat’s richness, making it a fresh, vibrant pairing for the season. What’s your favorite side dish to serve with lamb? Share ideas in the comments!",
