Let’s start with a fact: You’re not making the turkey. Even if you’re the most qualified bird roaster of the group, you’re still a guest—and any combination of dry brining, deep frying, roasting, or carving is well beyond the scope of somebody potentially ending their night on a futon. Instead, make a side. Because people love sides. Want proof? Well, according to a report titled, “State of the Sides,” conducted by Campbell’s, the canned soup stalwart whose products are famously turned into holiday sides, the majority of Americans prefer eating sides over turkey. So yeah, according to #CorporateResearch (and some personal observations), people love sides. But what side should you make? Good question. The answer: One that’s delicious on Thursday’s feast, adaptable on Friday’s lunch, and doesn’t require enormous amounts of effort or equipment. In short, any of the ten below options. To make this selection process even easier, we’ve ranked our top side recipes from best (10) to extra best (1). From Our Shop How They’re Being Judged: Immediate Flavor: How much plate real estate does this side command? Leftover Potential: Will your always-hungry-uncle devour the remnants the following day? Intrusiveness: Does it look like you’re trying to steal the host’s thunder? Equipment: How many times do I need to ask someone to find me some godforsaken appliance, likely stashed in the back of a corner cabinet? Skill required: Can I make this after a responsible volume of mid-morning Bloody Marys? Some Disclaimers: These recipes are greatest hits. Bangers, even. Anything that made this list is in the 99th percentile of Thanksgiving side recipes. There are infinite great side dishes, obviously. Meaning, we certainly left off many—if not all—of your favorites. We encourage you to share those with us (read: tell me how wrong we were). After all, that’s why the comment section exists. 10. The Best Thanksgiving Sausage Stuffing There Ever Was by Cara Nicoletti Spoiler: This is the only stuffing recipe you’ll find on this list. It’s not that we aren’t fans (it’s possibly our favorite side), but stuffing rubs shoulders with turkey, fire building, and television programming in the world of “things we’re leaving to the host.” That said, if you’re going to stick your neck all the way out there and tackle stuffing, Cara Nicoletti’s version is your best bet. 9. Roasted Cranberry Sauce With Orange Making the best cranberry sauce recipe on our site is an ideal play for anybody who wants to dramatically improve Thursday’s feast (and Friday’s sandwiches) while remaining under the radar. 8. Herb \u0026 Seed Salad There’s a lot to like about this Kendra Vaculin salad, but here are the highlights: It’s easy. It’s easy to shop for. And it’s easy to fall in love with because its crunch and acidity pair well with all the other heaviness on your plate. Did I mention it’s easy? 7. Roasted Vegetables With Bright \u0026 Crunchy Herbed Topping This recipe’s strength is its open endedness and efficiency. Meaning, using just a handful of pantry ingredients, you can transform any root vegetable (carrots, parsnips, squash, etc.) into something that commands substantial plate real estate. 6. Martha Stewart’s Macaroni \u0026 Cheese I couldn’t be less interested in answering the “Is mac \u0026 cheese a Thanksgiving side?” question. Instead, let’s shift the question to something rooted in objective truth: Has anybody ever thought Martha Stewart’s famed mac \u0026 cheese wouldn’t be fully delicious on a Thanksgiving plate? No, no they haven’t. 5. Roasted Brussels Sprouts With Pears \u0026 Pistachios These sprouts have earned over 100 positive reviews from our community. Here are some of our favorites: “I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and it was really delicious. A great addition to my holiday menu,” writes June. “I’m not a fan of brussels sprouts but this recipe was amazing,” says Hazel. And then there’s Carolyn: “I quadrupled it!” 4. Michel Richard’s Glazed \u0026 Glistening Haricot Verts Needs just one pan, six ingredients, and eight minutes of work—these effortless beans are the right choice for anyone hoping to spend as little time in the kitchen as possible. Put differently, if you think the holiday could even somewhat resemble that episode from The Bear, make these. 3. Goguma Mattang Recipe developer Catherine Yoo says it best: “Deep-fried then shellacked in a syrup, [these] sweet potato chunks take on impossibly crispy shells that shatter to reveal a soft, fluffy interior.” We’re sold—especially because everything comes together in under 30 minutes. 2. Scalloped Potatoes With Caramelized Onions Just look at the picture. Why are you still reading this? Can you please just look down at the picture? Since you’ve looked at the picture, there’s no way you haven’t just clicked on the recipe already, but if for some reason you couldn’t find it, I’d say this: Even on a plate filled with mash, there’s always room for cheesy, creamy scalloped potatoes studded with caramelized onions. 1. Nea’s Milk Buns Roll into somebody’s home and bake them the best buns of their life—from scratch—and they’ll roll out the red carpet for you. “Oh, you’re looking for a stand mixer? It’s right here!” “Would you like another mimosa—I’d love to make that for you!” “Is there any way you could set aside a few buns just for me? I’ll make sure you don’t have to sit near Cousin Steve.” You want that treatment? Make these buns. What sides should have cracked the top 10? Let us know in the comments below!",
