  "text": "We jokingly call these meaty, greeny, cheesy, beany, spicy baked chickpeas because, well, internet recipe naming conventions make us laugh but I really think of them as Pizza Beans 2.0. I introduced Pizza Beans 1.0 in my second cookbook, Smitten Kitchen Every Day, where I dreamed of a mash-up of Greek gigante beans in tomato sauce and an American baked ziti, with beans instead of noodles. I called them “pizza” beans to try to convince my then-kindergartener to try them with clever marketing. We still adore the recipe and all of the truly unexpected places it’s landed. But to be honest, these are even more popular with the family these days. Heartier with chickpeas, Italian sausage, dark greens, extra red pepper flakes for heat, and a pecorino-mozzarella broiled cheesy top, the whole dish seems louder, and even more filling. You can see that our default is still to scoop them onto garlic bread (also helps bring reluctant 4th graders to the table) but they’re also fantastic, with or without the melted cheese on top, over polenta or even pasta. It makes a big pan of beans and the leftovers are great — perfect for meal prepping. Podcast! The newest episode of my podcast with J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, The Recipe with Kenji and Deb, is all about brownies, a beloved topic here at the Smitten Kitchen. You can listen to it anywhere you get your podcasts and catch up on any episodes you’ve missed right here, such as Nachos, Meatballs, and Onion Soup. New episodes drop every other Monday. I hope you enjoy listening as much as we’re enjoying the conversation. Staub x Smitten Kitchen Braiser: It’s been nine months since I announced that I was partnering with Staub to get them to bring back one of my favorite pans, a squat 4-quart Dutch oven (known as a braiser) shown here. I first bought my braiser in 2014 and have since cooked so many things in, it barely leaves my stove. It’s sold out a few times but is finally back in stock and I hope you get a chance to snag one — or nudge a friend or family member about the perfect gift for you. You can order yours here. I hope you love it as much as I love mine. Ziti Chickpeas with Sausage and Kale Note: If your mozzarella seems wet or comes in water, drain it on paper towels for a while before grating it so the final dish doesn’t become too watery. Gluten-free: This dish is (of course) only gluten-free if you exclude the garlic bread, or make garlic bread with gf bread. Glug of olive oil1 medium onion, chopped small3 garlic cloves, minced12 ounces sweet or spicy Italian sausage, casings removedKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper1 teaspoon dried oregano1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or less to taste1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes2 15-ounce cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed1 6-8-ounce bundle kale, stemmed, or 4 to 5 ounces kale leaves, cut into thin ribbons3/4 pound mozzarella, coarsely grated (see Note)2/3 cup finely grated pecorino cheeseGarlic bread, for serving, if you wish Make the meaty chickpeas: Heat large sauté pan — if yours is ovenproof, you can even use it as your final baking vessel — over medium-high heat. Coat with a couple tablespoons of olive oil, and heat oil. Add onion and garlic and cook until they begin to soften, about 4 minutes. Add ground sausage, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, lots of freshly ground black pepper, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, breaking up the sausage with your spoon into bite-sized pieces and browning them, about 6 to 8 minutes. Add tomatoes (beware the splatter) and chickpeas and bring mixture to a boil, then lower the heat to keep it at a simmer. Taste for seasoning; I usually add another 1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond brand) and more black pepper here. Simmer the chickpeas in the sauce for 10 minutes, or if you have more time, simmering them for 20 to 25 minutes softens them in a lovely way. If the mixture looks too thick, add 1/2 cup water, 1/4 cup at a time, until you get a thick but saucy consistency. Add kale and let it cook until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. If you’re preparing the dish for later, or skipping the cheese on top, this is a great place to pause the recipe. You could even freeze it at this point. To finish: Heat your oven’s broiler. If your pan isn’t ovenproof, transfer chickpea mixture to a baking dish. Scatter the top with both cheeses and broil until the cheese is melted and browned in spots. Eat right away. Do ahead: See notes within the recipe about where to pause. You can reheat the chickpeas in a 350-degree oven for 15 minutes; I usually keep the lid on. Post navigation",
