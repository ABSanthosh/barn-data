This refrain has been sung around the country since the pandemic, and it wasn’t the first time Mr. Kim, the store’s chief executive, had listened to it.But that night when he got home, he did something about it.In a “Dear Greenpoint” letter he posted on Instagram, Mr. Kim wrote, “I just want to say I’m sorry for the high prices and you were right,” modifying “high” with another, more pungent adjective.After looking around northern Brooklyn to see what other stores charged, he’d decided to match or beat them. He has already dropped prices on thousands of items, he wrote, about 15 percent of what Jubilee sells.Re-pricing the whole store has become his mission, and he has been out on the floor making the changes for 14 hours every day this week.“I’m trying to work as fast as I can,” he said. “If you bought a product yesterday and I changed it today, you overspent yesterday.”As in much of the city, the high cost of living is an obsession in Greenpoint. In the Democratic mayoral primary last month, Zohran Mamdani, who has made affordability the main theme of his campaign, won 75 percent of the vote in the neighborhood.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
