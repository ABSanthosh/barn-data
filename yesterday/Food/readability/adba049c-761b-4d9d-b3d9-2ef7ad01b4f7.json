Do I actually dream of a daring kitchen filled with striking colors and intricate patterns?This kitchen, which started out grimy white and transformed into a color wonderland, was definitely one of those that made me think twice about my own relatively plain kitchen. We initially published it a few years ago, and it’s still one of the boldest kitchen redos I’ve ever seen — and is especially remarkable considering the $200-or-less budget the DIYer behind it was aiming for.What I love so much about this kitchen makeover is that it surprised me. I’ve seen (and loved!) deep green on kitchen cabinets before, but the bright and clear tone of this pick feels especially fresh — like the leaves of your favorite tropical houseplant. And instead of pairing it with white, this intrepid DIYer chose an equally striking coral color that I can say with certainty I’ve never seen in a kitchen before or since. The final color choice — a zippy lime green for the trim — somehow pulls them both together.While the cabinets, walls, and trim are the biggest changes here, the DIYer made sure to fill the space with colorful decor that goes beyond run-of-the-mill framed art. Her picks include hanging lanterns, patterned plates, and beautiful stained glass, which all work to turn this kitchen into a kaleidoscope of color.",
