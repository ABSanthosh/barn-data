Over there is a tipsy rock singer executing a perfect run-through of Michael Jackson’s dance moves to “Thriller.” And in comes a 60-year-old intensive-care-unit nurse and her wife, sitting down to a romantic dinner after a long night of clubbing.There’s a chaotic cadence to the 24-hour diner — a refuge where patrons of all ages, backgrounds and tastes are welcome to bump elbows over patty melts and pancakes. Unlike the restaurant that keeps traditional business hours, the diner shape-shifts as the night wears on and different kinds of customers pour in. It can be whatever they need it to be — its menu, mood and playlist often changing from hour to hour.All-night diners are a signature New York institution.

According to Yelp data, the city lost 13 percent of its more than 500 round-the-clock restaurants from February 2020 to February 2024, including favorites like Neptune Diner in Astoria, Queens, and Arch Diner near Canarsie Pier in Brooklyn.ImageThe new Kellogg’s chef, Jackie Carnesi, made tweaks to the menu but was adamant that 24-hour service had to stay.Credit...Yuvraj Khanna for The New York TimesIn the midst of all those closings, at least one place was reborn: Kellogg’s Diner, a stalwart of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, from 1928.
