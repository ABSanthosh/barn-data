While there were definitely some cute product recs, the overwhelming #1 request? Just not having to think so much. And honestly, it makes sense. Moms are still handling a disproportionate amount of household labor—something best-selling author Eve Rodsky breaks down beautifully in Fair Play. When I spoke with Eve a few years ago, we talked about how, despite so many moms working full-time (or juggling part-time roles), they're still the ones managing the mental load at home. This particular story started as a few casual questions, but word spread fast. My mom asked her friends, I asked my friends, then my colleagues and neighbors, and suddenly I had more responses than I knew what to do with. So, I decided to pull them together in one place—partly as a tribute, partly as a gift guide, but mostly as a reminder that the best Mother’s Day presents aren’t necessarily things. In fact, this might be the last-minute Mother’s Day gift guide that puts all others (even my own) to shame. Or maybe this is the worst gift guide ever, because only a few things on this list are real items. So, What do Moms Really Want This Year? I had a hunch some moms would say “sleep” or “time with family.\" But I was surprised by how consistent the answers were—and how beautifully simple. I think one of my best friend’s mom summed it up really well. She said she’d love someone to walk the dog for once—not because she hates walking her dog dog, but because she always does it, and I’m sure no one really notices. My mom? She just doesn’t want to think about dinner. I asked her again this year and she said the same thing: “I really just don’t want to make dinner.” Fair. After living on my own, I can confidently say I have no idea how she pulled off dinner every single night for a house of five. (For the record, my sister and I are handling all meals this year.) TL;DR: These Gifts Are Always a Safe Bet If you're stuck or running out of time, here’s a roundup of what came up again and again: • Experiences with their kids: Think planting flowers, cooking together, or a nice dinner with everyone—just don’t make her plan it. And in case you’re wondering why I emphasize the last part, I’ve heard one too many stories of a mother having to plan her own brunch. They make the reservation, even invite the people. • Peace and quiet: Whether it’s a morning alone, an empty house, or a massage, moms are craving a little calm. • Take something off her plate: Walk the dog, plan the meals, make the reservations. She notices. • Spa day anything: Facial, massage, mani/pedi, or even a blowout. Make her feel pampered. • A good bottle of wine (if she likes wine). • Good coffee: Take her out, get a local gift card, or spring for a subscription (Pro tip: these make the best last minute gifts, but still feel thoughtful). • Thoughtful jewelry: Think: birthstones of her kids or grandkids, a locket with a photo, or an initial necklace. I’m stipulating thoughtfulness because I think people go wrong here by going too generic. What Moms of Young Kids Want This one’s easy: Sleep. And maybe a shower. And also not having to put the toilet seat down. I asked my sister (who had a baby last year) and she said: “You’re going to hate this, but sleep would be amazing. And an uninterrupted shower. But also pancakes, and maybe a latte with lavender syrup?” Honestly? Iconic. Sleep would be amazing. And an uninterrupted shower. She also shared some cute product picks: • A necklace or bracelet with initials or birthstones (she loves Fable England) • A locket with a photo of her baby • Portland Syrups for coffee or tea Another mom echoed the same: sleep, quiet, and something sweet from the kids. Bonus points if she doesn’t have to clean up after it (in fact, you should make sure she doesn’t). This age group was all about practicality with a hint of luxury: • Getting the car detailed—a gift that’s low-effort for you but high-impact for her. • Time in the garden—give her a peaceful morning with her plants (maybe gift her a few, too). • A spa appointment or time alone at home while you handle things. One mom told me she used to plan her own fancy brunches when her kids were younger, and while they were fun, it was also a lot of work. “Of course I would have to plan the whole thing so it wasn’t truly an occasion for me,” she said. (She did clarify she was still glad she did it). Let that be your sign not to make her organize her own celebration. What Moms of Adult Kids Want If your mom’s kids are out of the house, the one thing she wants most is your time. Some asked for a family dinner. Some asked for a solo spa day. Some said, “Both, please.” One mom jokingly said she wanted the newest iPhone. But when pressed, she admitted: “I just want time with my family.” I say get her both, she deserves it. Another sweet idea? Organize a brunch or dinner with her friends. Yes, she loves you—but sometimes a mom’s best Mother’s Day is spent with her fellow moms. What Grandmothers Want This answer was unanimous: to see their grandkids. Also wine. But mostly grandkids. “Well that’s easy! I would want to spend time with my boys, my daughters-in-law, and all my grandchildren and great-grandchildren, watching all the 'mamas' having a great day with their 'babies.' Is that corny?” — my grandma. Not at all. The Final Word If you’re someone who typically turns to gift guides, don’t worry, I’m one of you. I love picking out products and making a list (in fact, I made several of them this year). But turns out, what most moms really want is for you to notice how much they do. To spend time with them. And maybe, just maybe, to get a quiet moment to themselves. Turns out, what most moms really want is for you to notice how much they do. To spend time with them. And maybe, just maybe, to get a quiet moment to themselves. So yes—grab the coffee gift card or the necklace or the wine. But also, do the dishes. Make the dinner. Take something off her list. That’s the kind of gift she’ll remember. Some More Real Responses I Loved If you’re curious and want to see some answers I compiled, here’s what I got. I hope you read through and enjoy these as much I did. And for all the moms reading this: thank you for everything you do! I’m constantly in awe. I wish you all the peace, relaxation, and time with your family (or alone, if that’s what you want). • “Lunch or breakfast with sisters or friends, or a spa treatment like a mani/pedi or facial.” • “I’ve always been fine with just planting flowers in the yard and enjoying the day. If the kids aren’t there—even better. It’s just more relaxing (I’m with them all the time lol).” • “My car detailed.” • “Just time to be alone.” • “One day of not having to wipe a butt or put down the toilet seat so I don’t fall in #boymom.” • “My coffee still hot from start to finish”. • “My bed to myself.” • “Simply time with my children and grandchild—however that looks, and probably to not think about dinner!” • “I would want: 1) someone to walk my dog first thing in the morning so for 1 day out of 365 it wasn’t on me and 2) to do something experiential with my kids. Not necessarily big…but go for a walk, see a movie, cook dinner together, work in the garden.” As a woman who has turned 60 and has kids that are 29 and 31, I'd like nothing more than spending time with my kids and their family, just hanging out. • “As a woman who has turned 60 and has kids that are 29 and 31, I'd like nothing more than spending time with my kids and their family, just hanging out. No fussy stuff... I'd love a day shopping for plants and having them help me plant them, and then out for a nice dinner. I'd also be down for them making dinner, chatting while they cook, whatever is easier and works with the days plans. I don't want to have to plan anything... And no purchased gifts (don't we all have enough stuff??) The gift of time (or a homemade gift/card) is enough for me.” • “Maya Brenner initial necklace is one of my most prized possessions. Also massage and facials.” • “I’m easy. Wine. A gift certificate for mani and pedi.” • “[Sleep]—that’s what I would have said when you all were younger! I also love gifts that make me feel seen, that match my hobbies and interests. Like a book nook kit or something Tudor! Also flowers!” • “What do I really want for Mother's Day? I'd love a beautiful spring day—70 degrees—nice enough to take a bike ride with friends in the morning, finishing up with coffee and scones at a local coffee shop. I love going out with other women, celebrating us, knowing we will all gather with our families later in the day.” • “Time with my adult kids.” • “Nice lunch with girlfriends at fancy restaurant (no clean-up after)” Nice lunch with girlfriends at fancy restaurant (no clean-up after) • “Handwritten letters from my boys” • “Family lunch outdoors with extended family (grandparents, etc)” • “Scenic hike with family and dog” • “This is my day! I want to go all out!—my aunt in response to my mom saying she just wants a chill day Note: some of these answers have been edited for clarity! Thank you to all the wonderful mothers who answered me!! So back to you all: What do you think is the best Mother's Day Gift?",
