I’ve been trying to get them to do more around the house, specifically in the kitchen, and they enjoy being trusted with the responsibility. Following the loose guidelines of including one fruit and vegetable, they love having autonomy over their lunchboxes. Then, once their lunches were in full swing, I started incorporating weekly “Helpie Selfie” dinners they make themselves. I’m not strict about what they make, and it’s not always the healthiest—the microwave is their #1 tool, so ramen and mac n’ cheese are up for grabs—but as long as they make it on their own and we all sit down together, I’m happy. Oh, and they gotta clean up their own mess ’cause I’m not raising a bunch of slobs! Green Goddess Tea Sandwiches Joy once highlighted these delightful sandwiches for a Mother’s Day menu, and now we can offer them as a gift this year since you won’t have to lift a finger. My daughter’s go-to lunch is an olive and cream cheese sandwich—no crust, lord help you if you even suggest she try crust—so these provided a delicious way to break up the routine and vary her vegetable intake. Then, of course, because it would be too simple if everyone wanted the same thing, one of my sons opted for no carrots while the other opted for no cucumbers. But once the ingredients are all laid out—which just requires chopping and mixing on their part—it’s simple enough for everyone to arrange their sandwiches according to their own picky desires. Serve with a side of fresh fruit and potato chips and you’re good to go. (Pictured is an updated version of the sandwich – a bit more fussy with a iceberg lettuce salad topping)  Egg Salad Sandwiches It’s officially picnic season, which means our dinners are often eaten in the backyard or in the Little League stands. My kids love egg salad, which is a win since it’s packed with protein. Get a dozen eggs, then go ahead and hard boil ‘em so all the kids have to do is chop and stir. For serving, my kids love Hawaiian rolls, probably because they’re sweet and fit perfectly in their mini hands. But I do want to try Joy’s suggestion of using potato bread at some point. We skipped her pickled onions, though maybe they’ll grow to appreciate that addition later on as their palates become more sophisticated. Have your kids double this recipe because you’re going to want an encore.  Grape and Herb Chicken Salad  I have mentioned before that this is one of the few dishes all three of my kids happily devour, and now they can make it themselves so long as I prep the chicken ahead of time. Every week I leave a container of shredded chicken in the fridge for lunch and dinner prep—I just set a few chicken breasts with broth in the Crockpot, then shred it—so it was easy for them to grab and go. I don’t usually have half and half or buttermilk on hand, so that never makes it into the dish, and the kids don’t like parsley or green onions. Or cayenne. But the rest of the recipe simply requires measuring and mixing, which they are happy to do.  Cookies and Cream Brownies  The hardest part about making this recipe will be insisting that your kids wait four (4!) hours to cool before eating. I eliminated the coffee from the recipe because I say yes to a lot of things but refuse to let my children have coffee until they’re 18 years old. (They are so naturally caffeinated.) This came together quickly and easily and required minimal dishes, though it definitely helped that the kids were scrambling to eat the batter, helping cut down on clean-up time. We used Betty Crocker brownie mix instead of Ghirardelli. And one commenter subbed Oreos for graham crackers, which I think we’ll try next time. And there will definitely be a next time.  Chocolate Croissant French Toast This is the most delicious thing I’ve eaten all year and I guarantee you will be a Sleepover Queen if you serve it on Sunday morning. We didn’t have our act together to prep it the night before, as Joy did, but my 7-year-old daughter was so proud of herself after she made it on her own. We used the chocolate croissants from Trader Joe’s—found in the bread section, not the frozen kind—and I decided the dish was already sweet enough so we didn’t need to serve with additional syrup or whipped cream. One of my son’s friends who slept over Saturday night declared it was the best breakfast he’d ever had. Serve with sliced strawberries to make it extra fancy.  Other tasks I am teaching: Having them navigate car rides by following a Google Maps printout (RIP MapQuest), pumping gas (and not fighting over whose turn it is), doing their own laundry (a work in progress), cleaning their rooms (non-negotiable), and picking up Mother’s coffee order while she waits in the car (instills independence). I still do my little acts of love, like putting their pajamas in the dryer right before they go to sleep so they’re nice n’ toasty in bed. And, of course, I continue to carry out 99.9% of the housework. But I like to think I’m molding them into better roommates for the future. As they say: Sow now, reap later.",

My kids love egg salad, which is a win since it’s packed with protein. Get a dozen eggs, then go ahead and hard boil ‘em so all the kids have to do is chop and stir. For serving, my kids love Hawaiian rolls, probably because they’re sweet and fit perfectly in their mini hands. But I do want to try Joy’s suggestion of using potato bread at some point. We skipped her pickled onions, though maybe they’ll grow to appreciate that addition later on as their palates become more sophisticated. Have your kids double this recipe because you’re going to want an encore. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://joythebaker.com/2016/06/grape-and-herb-chicken-salad/#tasty-recipes-31214-jump-target\"\u003eGrape and Herb Chicken Salad\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI have mentioned before that this is \u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://joythebaker.com/2022/09/family-friendly-recipes/\"\u003eone of the few dishes all three of my kids happily devour\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e, and now they can make it themselves so long as I prep the chicken ahead of time. Every week I leave a container of shredded chicken in the fridge for lunch and dinner prep—I just set a few chicken breasts with broth in the Crockpot, then shred it—so it was easy for them to grab and go. I don’t usually have half and half or buttermilk on hand, so that never makes it into the dish, and the kids don’t like parsley or green onions. Or cayenne. But the rest of the recipe simply requires measuring and mixing, which they are happy to do. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-pin-url=\"https://joythebaker.com/2025/05/five-joy-the-baker-recipes-kids-can-make-on-their-own/?tp_image_id=56242\" data-pin-title=\"Five Joy The Baker Recipes Kids Can Make On Their Own\" data-pin-nopin=\"nopin\" src=\"https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BrowniesCookiesandCream-18-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BrowniesCookiesandCream-18-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BrowniesCookiesandCream-18-1-640x427.jpg 640w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BrowniesCookiesandCream-18-1-900x600.jpg 900w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BrowniesCookiesandCream-18-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BrowniesCookiesandCream-18-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%20800%20534\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BrowniesCookiesandCream-18-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BrowniesCookiesandCream-18-1-640x427.jpg 640w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BrowniesCookiesandCream-18-1-900x600.jpg 900w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BrowniesCookiesandCream-18-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BrowniesCookiesandCream-18-1.jpg 1200w\" data-lazy-src=\"https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BrowniesCookiesandCream-18-1-1024x683.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://joythebaker.com/2024/09/the-ultimate-easy-cookies-and-cream-brownies/#tasty-recipes-56243-jump-target\"\u003eCookies and Cream Brownies\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe hardest part about making this recipe will be insisting that your kids wait four (4!) hours to cool before eating. I eliminated the coffee from the recipe because I say yes to a lot of things but refuse to let my children have coffee until they’re 18 years old. (They are so naturally caffeinated.) This came together quickly and easily and required minimal dishes, though it definitely helped that the kids were scrambling to eat the batter, helping cut down on clean-up time. We used Betty Crocker brownie mix instead of Ghirardelli. And one commenter subbed Oreos for graham crackers, which I think we’ll try next time. And there will definitely be a next time. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-pin-url=\"https://joythebaker.com/2025/05/five-joy-the-baker-recipes-kids-can-make-on-their-own/?tp_image_id=56750\" data-pin-title=\"Five Joy The Baker Recipes Kids Can Make On Their Own\" src=\"https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Castironchristmas-1-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Castironchristmas-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Castironchristmas-1-427x640.jpg 427w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Castironchristmas-1-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Castironchristmas-1-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Castironchristmas-1-900x1350.jpg 900w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Castironchristmas-1-150x225.jpg 150w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Castironchristmas-1-scaled.jpg 1707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%20683%201024\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Castironchristmas-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Castironchristmas-1-427x640.jpg 427w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Castironchristmas-1-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Castironchristmas-1-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Castironchristmas-1-900x1350.jpg 900w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Castironchristmas-1-150x225.jpg 150w, https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Castironchristmas-1-scaled.jpg 1707w\" data-lazy-src=\"https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_orig,to_webp,s_webp/joythebaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Castironchristmas-1-683x1024.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://joythebaker.com/2025/02/chocolate-croissant-overnight-breakfast-casserole/\"\u003eChocolate Croissant French Toast\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis is the most delicious thing I’ve eaten all year and I guarantee you will be a Sleepover Queen if you serve it on Sunday morning. We didn’t have our act together to prep it the night before, as Joy did, but my 7-year-old daughter was so proud of herself after she made it on her own. We used the chocolate croissants from Trader Joe’s—found in the bread section, not the frozen kind—and I decided the dish was already sweet enough so we didn’t need to serve with additional syrup or whipped cream. One of my son’s friends who slept over Saturday night declared it was the best breakfast he’d ever had.

I still do my little acts of love, like putting their pajamas in the dryer right before they go to sleep so they’re nice n’ toasty in bed. And, of course, I continue to carry out 99.9% of the housework. But I like to think I’m molding them into better roommates for the future. As they say: Sow now, reap later. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
