Maybe you’re all in. Maybe you’ve only absorbed it passively, against your will. Either way, it’s hard to escape. As someone who’d never tuned in before, I was surprised by the sudden cultural takeover. In the past few weeks alone, I’ve sat through full dinners where people debated their favorite couples, predicted drama, and ranked bombshells with passionate conviction.

Maybe you’ve only absorbed it passively, against your will. Either way, it’s hard to escape. As someone who’d never tuned in before, I was surprised by the sudden cultural takeover. In the past few weeks alone, I’ve sat through full dinners where people debated their favorite couples, predicted drama, and ranked bombshells with passionate conviction. I finally had to get up to speed—if only to participate in what feels like a nationwide group project (slash networking event). Here’s what I’ve gathered: A group of hot singles enters a villa filled with loungers and daybeds. They couple up—sometimes blindly, sometimes not. They do challenges. New bombshells arrive to stir the pot. A new episode drops every weeknight. Oh, and Huda, Amaya, Nick, and Olandria? They’re major players. (I’m listening. I’m learning.) One unexpected takeaway? Breakfast is a whole thing in the villa. Aside from the ever-present champagne, it’s basically the only meal we regularly see. And what do they eat? Avocados. So many avocados. Supposedly they go through dozens a day. The guys also try to impress the girls by bringing them breakfast in the morning—though the effort (and execution) often leaves much to be desired. So in honor of villa mornings, the nation's current Love Island obsession, and the power of a good breakfast spread, we rounded up a few dishes that we’d actually wake up for. With the help of a few fellow editors who are just as hooked, here are the breakfast recipes we’d couple up for—no bombshell entrance required. 1. Cottage cheese pancakes with strawberry maple syrup Don’t knock them till you try them. They’re buttery, fluffy, and the strawberry maple syrup takes them totally over the top. 2. French toast breakfast sandwich Want to win someone over? Skip the boring toast and deliver this golden, syrupy twist on a breakfast sandwich. Bombshell behavior. 3. Pistachio Belgian waffle These are giving Dubai chocolate bar meets poolside brunch. Rich, nutty, and impossible to say no to. 4. Scrambled egg sandwich with garlic aioli A good sauce says a lot about a person. This sandwich (with fluffy eggs and garlicky aioli) shows you care—and that’s villa currency. 5. Avocado toast board One slice of toast? No thanks. Build an entire board with toppings, sauces, and different bread options. I might just leave the villa with you. 6. Mango Smoothie Bowl I’d spring out of bed for this smoothie bowl—especially if it comes with all the pretty toppings and a vintage spoon on the side. 7. Iced Coffee with Avocado Yes, with avocado. It’s creamy, dreamy, and uses up the dozens they’re probably hoarding in the villa kitchen. What breakfast would get you out of bed?",
