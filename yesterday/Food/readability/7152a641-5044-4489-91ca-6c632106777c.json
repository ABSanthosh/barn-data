All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Krakenimages.com/ShutterstockThough New York City is known for its drinkable tap water, I’ve always kept a filtered pitcher in my kitchen just to be safe. However, sometimes I give in and refill my bottles straight from the sink, because refilling my pitcher is the bane of my existence. (I’m exaggerating, but it is a total chore.) Other times, I’ll even drink less water to avoid the tap or pitcher situation altogether. I’ve always wished for an apartment with a built-in filtration system or a fridge with a dispenser, but neither of those things are likely in the cards as long as I rent in the city.However, I’ve just found the next best thing. Before I added one of Waterdrop’s filtered electric dispensers to my kitchen, I’d seen it around on TikTok, and was already halfway influenced. It’s way sleeker and simpler than the manual ones that I’m more familiar with. Not to mention, the version I tried is far less clunky, taking up minimal space on my countertop. It’s even designed to fit inside the fridge door! Keep reading to find out even more reasons why I love this gadget — and why I have it to thank for improving my hydration habits.What is Waterdrop’s Compact Electric Water Filter Pitcher?After a single day of having this intuitive gadget in my kitchen, I ditched my old pitcher, and I have a feeling I’ll never go back. Why? Waterdrop’s dispenser is wildly easy to use, operated by a single button on a touch screen. It holds 14 cups of water at a time, using the electric system to filter roughly one cup per minute. It’s been certified by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials to reduce over 30 substances, like chlorine, lead, mercury, and more. Further, a third-party lab tested the system’s capability of reducing PFOA and PFOS. It starts filtering it instantly when you press the button, coming out within the second. The filter is designed to last for up to three months before replacement — and after fully charging it, you won’t have to worry about it dying for another 30 days.Plus, its general build is impressive, too. Measuring 10.6 inches wide, 10.2 inches tall, and 4.6 inches deep, it won’t hog the whole shelf inside your fridge or a good chunk of the countertop. Instead, it slides on the shelf inside the door, saving space.Why I Love Waterdrop’s Compact Electric Water Filter PitcherWhat’s not to love about this clever dispenser? In fact, it came into my life at the perfect time — I’m on crutches and can’t bear weight on one foot, so this dispenser is miles easier to manage than a filtered pitcher. Filling it up is a breeze, even in my kitchen’s too-shallow sink. The handle attached on top makes for a smooth transfer between locations. I prefer to leave it out on my countertop for quicker access, though it definitely is narrow enough to nestle inside my fridge’s door. Plus, the design is minimalist-looking, so it blends right into my white backsplash.Instead of bothering with the messiness of a pitcher — spilling when pouring is pretty much unavoidable in my experience — this dispenser tidies up the entire process. After firmly pressing the button twice, water comes out fast and seamlessly into my bottle. I refill it less frequently than my pitcher, to boot. All in all, I don’t know how I went so long without making the switch to a gadget like this one, but now that I’ve seen the light I’m never going back. I’m drinking more water than ever, which makes it totally worth it.Buy: Waterdrop Compact Electric Water Filter Pitcher, $39.99 (normally $49.99)Cook/ShopA weekly newsletter to keep you up to date on all the latest cooking gadgets, must-have kitchen tools, and can’t-miss sales to shop.",
