  "description": "There’s nothing worse than spending hours prepping for a holiday house party—to only get stuck making a zillion drinks for guests, or worse, running out of ice. We’ve found a solution: freezer door cocktails. Designed to live in your freezer indefinitely, these batched drinks are ready to pour as soon as your guests arrive—even when that one person inevitably shows up early. Freezer door cocktails are simple: you batch your drink, dilute it with water, and freeze it (old liquor bottles work great, but any freezer-safe 750 ml bottle will do). When it’s time to serve, there’s no need to shake, stir, or add ice. They’re already perfectly chilled and ready to go—they also won’t freeze because of their proportional alcohol content. From olive oil martinis to chocolate negronis, these drinks are as easy to make as they are to serve. Read More \u003e\u003e",

We’ve found a solution: freezer door cocktails. Designed to live in your freezer indefinitely, these batched drinks are ready to pour as soon as your guests arrive—even when that one person inevitably shows up early. Freezer door cocktails are simple: you batch your drink, dilute it with water, and freeze it (old liquor bottles work great, but any freezer-safe 750 ml bottle will do). When it’s time to serve, there’s no need to shake, stir, or add ice. They’re already perfectly chilled and ready to go—they also won’t freeze because of their proportional alcohol content. From olive oil martinis to chocolate negronis, these drinks are as easy to make as they are to serve. The best part? You make them well in advance so you don’t have to worry about running out of time or compromising quality. With these five recipes, you’ll keep drinks flowing all night long and enjoy the party to the fullest. And even if you’re not hosting, these are perfect to bring to your next gathering or have on hand for last minute happy hours. 1. Freezer Door Manhattan Julianna McIntosh, the creator behind the popular cocktail page Join Jules, has plenty of great recipes for freezer door cocktails, but you can’t go wrong with her classic Manhattan. She suggests repurposing an almost-empty bourbon bottle and rinsing with an absinthe wash to enhance the flavor. Make it ahead so that once guests arrive, all you need to do is pour into chilled glasses and garnish with maraschino cherries. 2. Chocolate Negroni J.M. Hirsch’s freezer door chocolate negroni adds a rich twist to the classic with crème de cacao and Punt e Mes. The latter is an Italian vermouth that gives the cocktail a deeper, more complex flavor. The result is a chilled, bittersweet drink with a smooth cocoa finish that everyone will love. 3. Olive Oil Martini If you love a martini that’s extra dirty with a touch of savory richness, this olive oil martini is for you. Another recipe from Julianna McIntosh’s book, Pretty Simple Cocktails, it’s made with olive oil-infused gin (or vodka)—and while it sounds fancy, the infusion is simple and done ahead of time, giving the drink a rich, savory base. If you don’t have time to infuse, you can also use something like this olive leaf gin. 4. Little Devil If you’re a fan of spicy margaritas, you’ll love this other recipe from J.M. Hirsch’s book, Freezer Door Cocktails. It combines blanco tequila with a unique blend of chili liqueur and cherry brandy, resulting in a fiery drink that’s both sweet and spicy. He recommends serving it over crushed ice with a dash of pickled jalapeño brine. 5. Espresso Martini To make this espresso martini freezer door friendly, you only need a few simple tweaks. Scale the proportions to make 8 drinks (or however many you want). Swap the fresh coffee for instant espresso powder, using around 3 ½ tablespoons per 8 drinks. Lastly, cut the amount of simple syrup in half so it doesn’t freeze. Add 2 oz of filtered water to dilute and let it freeze for at least an hour. To serve, pour into chilled coupes and garnish with espresso beans. We want to know: What is your favorite holiday cocktail?",
