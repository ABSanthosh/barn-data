We discussed soils and environmentalism, tariffs and trade, tasted dozens of wines, renewed old acquaintances and forged new ones. I gave a talk, on the place of New Zealand pinot noir on the world stage. (Spoiler alert: It currently has a bit role but shows potential.)But one significant feature made this wine conference entirely different from any I’ve ever attended. Enormous care was taken to weave the culture of the Māori, the Indigenous inhabitants of New Zealand, into the fabric of the event just as it is in the identity of the country.During the conference, Māori speakers introduced and summarized the Māori conception of tūrangawaewae (too-rung-uh-WAY-way), how the characteristics of a place define the identity and culture of the people who come from there.As I understood the thought, it goes well beyond the simple formula of place determining personality. Tūrangawaewae is often translated as “a place to stand,” which suggests as well that people belong to a place and can be their most authentic selves when they are in that place.It’s a complex idea that I admittedly understand superficially. But, as any wine lover might do, I immediately jumped to the French notion of terroir, the idea that the singular qualities of a particular place and people can be expressed through a wine.ImageHayden Johnston, left, and Haysley MacDonald of the Tuku collective.
