Some of my happiest, most successful mom-oriented days involved baking my mother's favorite chocolate cake with a cream cheese ribbon—sometimes with her help, sometimes stumbling along on my own. I think she liked it easily as much as the awkward poems and framed photos, though I doubt she'd ever tell. To help you find the perfect dessert, I’ve rounded up some of the best Mother's Day cakes from the Genius Recipes column, plus a few other favorites from around Food52. Whether you're baking for a mom, grandma, or yourself, there's a genius cake here for everyone. But what I really want to know is: What genius cake will you bake for your mother? 1. Chocolate Dump-It Cake From Amanda Hesser \"My mother has many specialties, but her Chocolate Dump-It Cake is most beloved in my family,\" Food52 founder Amanda Hesser writes. \"She kept this cake in the fridge, and it is sublime even when cold. I wrote about this Mother's Day cake in my second book, Cooking for Mr. Latte, but wanted to celebrate it here on Food52, as well.\" 2. Maialino's Olive Oil Cake Olive oil cake at its best has a crackling crust and an aromatic, oil-rich middle, which, if it held any more moisture, would be pudding. Pulling this off should be easy—there aren't even egg whites to whip and fold, nor butter to cream—but it isn't always. This one, however, is perfect, and will ruin you for all others. 3. Coconut Tres Leches Cake \"I started making tres leches because it is my neighbor's favorite thing, and I like her,\" says Food52 contributor aargersi. \"I started with Martha Stewart's recipe, which is a great jumping-off point—but it is not as juicy as a traditional tres leches, which you will find resting in a shallow lake of sweet milk. So I adjusted up for that, and here I have swapped in some coconut and some lime (because it is one of coconut's BFFs), and I used Tahitian vanilla, which is a bit more floral than Mexican (but if you can't find it, go with whatcha got). It's rich and milky and coconutty and good. Ask the neighbors.\" 4. Amazon Cake Meet your new go-to Mother's Day cake, bake sale cake, dinner party cake, late-night snack cake—for when the fridge is at its barest and you need chocolate cake now. (It's also vegan and parve and dirt cheap, but you wouldn't know unless we told you.) This isn't the richest, most chocolatey cake—if you like, you can amp up the chocolate by swapping in coffee for the water, or adding more cocoa. But you don't need to. It's a different animal: light, delicately strung together with cocoa, and not terribly sweet. 5. Banana Cake With Penuche Frosting From Lindsay-Jean Hard \"I think of this as my grandmother's recipe,\" Lindsay-Jean writes, \"but it's actually her mother's or her mother-in-law's...either way, it was a special cake that she would make for my father's birthday, as it's his favorite cake (and mine, too). It's a simple seeming cake (no vanilla?! not a spice to be found?!), but it's like your favorite banana bread, only lighter and fluffier, and the frosting truly makes this cake.\" 6. Roberta's Parsley Cake If we can put rosemary in our frozen yogurt and thyme in our cookies, there's nothing stopping parsley from treading over the line. It's festive and herb-forward, but also a bright spot at the end of a dense, salty Mother's Day meal. 7. Dense Chocolate Loaf Cake From Nigella Lawson On creating this cake, Nigella Lawson explains, \"I remember very strongly wanting to create what we call a loaf cake—and what is generally called a pound cake Stateside—that had a richness and squidginess of texture that this form of cake normally doesn't major in.\" And she did.   8. Rhubarb Buckle With Ginger Crumb There's a secret ingredient in here: ginger (times two). Fiery candied ginger is minced up in the crumb topping, and ground ginger in the cake, too—just enough to give it a warm, flirty \"je ne sais quoi\" that doesn't try to shout over the rhubarb. 9. Extremely Moist Chocolate Beet Cake From Nigel Slater Step aside, red velvet. It just so happens that the deep pink earthiness of a beet is surprisingly well suited for bittersweet chocolate. Crushed beets are also an inexpensive way to make a cake achingly moist, nearly molten. You don't need all that red food coloring after all to make the best Mother's Day cake. 10. Louisa's Cake From Jennifer Wagner \"Louisa is a family friend, gardener, and chef from Castellina in Chianti, Italy, where we gather several times a year,\" recipe author Jennifer Wagner writes. \"She cooks everything from memory and threw this together one night last spring. When we pressed her for the recipe she hastily rattled some ingredients off and we scrambled to write it all down on a napkin. Along with my husband and children, we've tested this cake about six times, and friends are constantly asking for the recipe.\" 11. Chocolate Cloud Cake From Richard Sax Flourless chocolate cake meets dreamy soufflé in this chocolate cloud cake that most certainly lives up to its name. A few smart tricks—like whipping some of the egg whites with sugar to make a fluffy meringue that gets folded in—help give this cake crackly edges and a moussey center any mother would love. 12. Lemon Buttermilk Cake From Maida Heatter With a near-perfect five star rating (over 50 reviews and counting!), this Genius buttermilk cake makes a lovely holiday treat—especially if your mom's a fan of puckery sweets. The recipe calls for more lemon and lemon zest than you'd normally find, plus the whole thing gets soaked in a lemony sugar syrup, so you won't be able to miss that citrusy kick when you take a bite.   13. Olive (Oil) Cake From Charlotte Druckman If adding actual olives sounds like a not-so-great idea, just trust us on this one—it's the salty-tangy addition you didn't know your olive oil cake was missing. For fans of savory-sweet combos, it's pretty much guaranteed to be a hit. 14. Our Best Carrot Cake From Coral Lee  While it may not technically be a Genius recipe, the carrot cake recipe from former Food52er Coral Lee is by far our very best. Moist, spongy cake with just the right amount of warming spices? Check. Ultra-fluffy cream cheese frosting that's not too sweet? Check. This Mother's Day cake ticks all the right boxes. 15. Strawberry Not-So-Short Cake From Erin McDowell  For a real Mother's Day showstopper (that the whole family can dig in to), look no further than this towering strawberry not-so-short cake from star baker Erin McDowell.  16. Fudgy Cream Cheese Chocolate Cake From Susan Miglore This birthday cake goes back three generations in my family (check out the full story here), and I think it would make very delicious Mother's Day cake for any chocolate-loving mom.  17. Whole Orange Cake From Sunset Magazine \u0026 Stephanie Spencer Meet the spunky citrus cake that's very good at brightening up someone's day (like, ahem, your mom). Surprise her with a slice or two and a freshly brewed pot of coffee in the morning for the sweetest-ever wake-up call.  18. Fresh Ginger Cake From Sylvia Thompson This hot-off-the-press Genius ginger cake isn't like others you've met before—as in, it doesn't taste like it came from the stale corner of a pastry shop or a candle store. The key: more freshly grated ginger than you probably think is necessary (you can even leave the skin on). 19. Marie-Hélène's Apple Cake From Dorie Greenspan This apple cake has been getting a stellar response: \"I made this lovely cake last night, got rave reviews from guests,\" one community member wrote. Our guess? Your mom will love it, too.  20. Chocolate Quinoa Cake From Paula Shoyer This flourless chocolate cake achieves a not-too-rich, birthday-cake-like crumb all thanks to a surprise ingredient: quinoa! Blend the batter to feature the quinoa a little or a lot—either way, you'll love the texture it brings to this fudgy cake.   21. Dark Chocolate Malt Cake From Samantha Seneviratne Malted milk powder brings this cake its deep, dark chocolate power, bolstered by strong brewed coffee and enhanced by the addition of sour cream. Best of all, there's a trick to getting the sprinkles on the cake's perimeter easily (but we won't give away the secret!). 22. Kabocha, Olive Oil \u0026 Bittersweet Chocolate Cake From Nicole Rucker \u0026 Gjelina If you're a fan of cozy, squishy pumpkin bread, this kicked-up version featuring rich, sweet kabocha squash and a silky olive-oil-infused glaze dotted with crisp pepitas may be your new go-to seasonal fave.  23. Strawberry \u0026 Butterscotch Whipped Cream Cake From Jami Curl This Genius cake from pastry chef Jami Curl needs no stand mixer—simply stir it together using the fresh or frozen fruit of your choice (Jami likes using frozen blueberries) and enjoy in under an hour. A vanilla and sour cream batter welcomes any and all customizations.  24. Ian Knauer's Chocolate Eggplant Cakes A glut of summer eggplant inspired this chocolate eggplant cake (which was, in turn, inspired by applesauce cake). Sweetened with wildflower honey and dolloped with whipped cream—spiked with maple syrup and salt if you'd like—this cake makes the most of prolific summer produce.  25. Danielle Noce's Brazilian Carrot Cake This carrot cake, popular in kitchens across Brazil, is reminiscent of a pound cake with a glossy chocolate ganache glaze that adds sweetness and complexity to familiar flavors. Break out the Bundt pan and prepare to discover the magic. 26. Molly Yeh's Dark Chocolate Marzipan Scone Loaf It's a loaf, it's a scone, it's a chocolate marzipan cake! Thanks to the boundless creativity of Molly Yeh, this Mother's Day–friendly dessert is all that and more. Dive in to this delicious hybrid confection, and uncover its hidden perks. 27. Rose Levy Beranbaum's Chocolate Oblivion Truffle Torte This flourless chocolate torte is a better and purer vehicle for chocolate than chocolate itself (scientifically speaking). If you're craving the kind of oblivion only a hefty dose of rich dark chocolate can provide, this is the recipe for you.  More Great Cakes for Mom, Recommended By the Food52 Editors 28. Easiest Chocolate Mousse Cake Mom deserves the sweetest, most indulgent dessert for Mother’s Day and this rich chocolate cake studded with fresh raspberries fits the bill. The base, which is a chewy chocolate brownie, is topped with the airiest chocolate mousse followed by a thick layer of vanilla whipped cream. 29. Sweet Potato Hummingbird Cake Everything that you’ve come to know and love about a hummingbird cake—fresh bananas, diced pineapple, and of course an epic layer of cream cheese frosting—is in this cake. But Mom should have a little something extra for Mother’s Day, which is why we’ve added green peanuts and grated sweet potatoes for extra moisture and sweetness. 30. Martha Stewart's Pineapple-Banana Upside-Down Cake Leave it to Martha to develop the recipe for our new favorite Mother’s Day cake. It’s fruitier, sweeter, and dare we say better version of the old-fashioned dessert. Thick pineapple slices are arranged in concentric circles to form a flower-like appearance.  31. Lemon-Raspberry Skillet Pudding Cake Raspberries are just starting to reach their peak season around Mother’s Day, which makes this bright cake perfect Mother’s Day. It’s best served warm, straight from the cast-iron skillet (ideally with a dollop of whipped cream or scoop of ice cream because mom deserves it). 32. Toasted Almond Chocolate Bundt Cake If you grew up enjoying a toasted almond ice cream bar on the beach during summer, you’ll love this cake. It’s made with a combination of almond flour and all-purpose flour, a duo of almond and vanilla extract, and melted chocolate. 33. Cream Cake Mom will love this super easy cake, which is light like an angel food cake but has the body of a pound cake. Like a black dress, it’s simplicity is best with just a few carefully chosen accessories. In this case, that means whipped cream and fresh berries. 34. Strawberry-Rhubarb Tres Leches Cake A springy twist on a beloved classic, soaked in three kinds of milk and topped with whipped cream and jammy fruit. 35. Lemon Velvet Sheet Cake  Ultra-tender, bright with lemon, and made for feeding a crowd (or just one very lucky mom).
