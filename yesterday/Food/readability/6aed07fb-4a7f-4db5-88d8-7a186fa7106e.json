  "description": "If you bake often—or just find yourself wandering the baking aisle—you might’ve noticed jars of vanilla bean paste popping up everywhere. This thick, syrupy blend combines concentrated vanilla extract with real vanilla seeds, offering a deep flavor and those signature specks without the fuss of scraping pods. It’s richer than extract, more convenient than whole beans and—thanks to its gel-like consistency—basically spill-proof. Ina Garten’s go-to vanilla brand, Nielsen Massey, has been selling theirs for years, but our Test Kitchen has noticed that you can even snag a $5 bottle of Bourbon Vanilla Bean Paste from Trader Joe’s. So, if you’ve recently picked up a jar (or just need an excuse to), we’ll show you how to put it to work. Good news: it’s an easy 1:1 swap for vanilla extract in any recipe. And, according to our very own Hotline, 1 tablespoon of paste equals 1 whole vanilla bean. Read More \u003e\u003e",

And, according to our very own Hotline, 1 tablespoon of paste equals 1 whole vanilla bean. For even more pro tips, we turned to our Test Kitchen experts for the inside scoop on the ingredient and their favorite ways to use it. “It's grown in popularity mostly because it seems to be more accessible. I never used to see it in stores, and when I did, it was always out of my budget. Now more brands offer it, including Trader Joe’s. I also think it does tend to have a more natural vanilla bean flavor, and the specs are always a bonus for me at least when I'm baking. I think the two go hand in hand!” —Nea Arentzen “For so many people, the addition of vanilla extract to baked goods has always been this compulsory thing. It’s ever present in a lot of dessert recipes, and that’s why people associate vanilla with “plain” or “boring.” In reality, vanilla is a super complex and distinct flavor that isn’t quite captured in your standard issue liquid extract. Vanilla bean paste does a better job of adding that richness to your baked goods, and I think it has made people excited about vanilla again. Don’t get me wrong, extract has its place and paste is certainly expensive, but a little goes a long way, and it presents an opportunity to use vanilla flavor with a little more intention.”—Noah Tanen “My favorite ways to use it are in custards/pastry creams and whipped cream, or any recipe where the specs are super visible and add to the look of the dessert. Or, any time I want a really strong, sweet vanilla flavor.”—Nea Arentzen “I typically reach for paste in a recipe where I really want to highlight vanilla as a primary flavor. A great example of this is a simple vanilla crème anglaise. If you don’t want to spring for the real vanilla bean we call for in this recipe, a half tablespoon substitution of vanilla bean paste will do nicely.”—Noah Tanen Beyond custards and creams, vanilla bean paste can add depth to just about anything. Let those signature specks shine in cookies, cakes, and breads, or stir it into syrups for your favorite drinks. And don’t shy away from adding it to your favorite breakfast treats—it’s just as dreamy in pancakes, French toast, and biscuits. What are your favorite ways to use vanilla bean paste?
