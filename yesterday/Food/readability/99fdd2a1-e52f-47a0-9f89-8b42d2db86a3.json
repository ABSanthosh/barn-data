  "text": "A List of Small, Perfect Things  (A short list inspired by this photo Will sent me of our pup Graham while I was away working this past weekend.  A list because life is just a series of tiny, wonderful moments between dishes, tax season, and flight delays) A cold pat of salted butter melting into the warm top of a Lemon Poppy Seed Muffin—some things in life should be both indulgent and dramatic.  A thick smear of cold cream cheese will also delight. Graham, once a skittish shelter pup, now sun-drunk on his own farm, hopefully unaware that he ever lived a single day without a fried egg breakfast and all of Texas as his backyard. The cup of coffee Will sets on my bedside table every morning. That sacred moment a cake is perfectly baked in the oven—golden brown, domed just so—and the whole kitchen smells like browned butter and caramelized sugar. The rhythmic scrape of a wooden spoon against a cast iron pan – a sound as soothing as knowing there’s still one more cookie left on a plate on the counter. A bowl of gumbo on the second day, when the flavors have reached their final form and you feel like some kind of culinary genius just for having leftovers. Flicking off the kitchen lights at the end of the night, knowing every dish is washed, the coffee pot is set, and that Future Me is going to love Present Me for the setup. Standing next to a stranger at the coffee shop, both pointing at the same pastry, silently confirming that you both have excellent taste. Curling up in the best spot on the couch, with a bowl of Homemade Hamburger Helper and absolutely no plans to explain your second helping. Falling asleep with a book on your chest, fully intending to read just one more page, but instead drooling slightly into page 74. Please please, tell me one yours! xo",
