Over the past few years, she’s also ventured into home and cookware, offering everything from super functional nonstick pans to slow cooker appliances. Now, she’s back with a new dinnerware set, and it’s one she’s been perfecting for nearly 12 months.The Pioneer Woman has just released a stunning new colorway of her popular Agatha and Collette dinnerware sets, which originally launched last fall. This vibrant shade adds a beautiful pop of navy blue that’ll stand out on any table setting.The new blue Collette dinnerware set is now available exclusively at Walmart. This 12-piece set includes four 10.5-inch dinner plates, four 8.5-inch salad plates, and four 6-inch bowls, all for just $49.98 — around $4 per dish. The set boasts a scalloped rim, adding a vintage, 20th-century touch that’s often seen in classic Victorian dinnerware designs.The Collette dinnerware set is also available at Walmart in jade green. Plus, there’s another version of this collection, the Agatha collection, offered in the same two colors but with a charming vintage floral print.“I planned and perfected the Agatha and Colette dinnerware patterns for over a year before I finally got to launch them in jade green last fall,” said Drummond in a press release sent to The Kitchn. “These new dinnerware collections represent everything I love about timeless, heritage-inspired designs, and the soft, elevated aesthetic of my products is something I’m so excited to watch unfold this year.”Drummond shared the new dinnerware collection on her Instagram, and people quickly flooded the comments with their reactions. One person wrote, “These are my dream dishes,” while another commented, “Stop.
