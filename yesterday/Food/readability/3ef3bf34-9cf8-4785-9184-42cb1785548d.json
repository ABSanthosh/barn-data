  "text": "Good morning, friends! This week is the Austin County Fair, and let me tell you—small-town Texas is truly where my heart is. The boots, the rodeo, the parade—it’s such a fun way to usher in the change of seasons. Between that and the fact that Thanksgiving is right around the corner (seriously, if we blink, it’ll be here tomorrow), I’m trying to soak up the moment while also prepping my house for a full-family visit. There’s nothing better than a full house (as long as the refrigerator is equally full) (and someone helps with the dishes). The kitchen has been my calm amidst the whirlwind, and I’m easing into Thanksgiving prep one recipe at a time. Well, one Pumpkin Texas Sheet Cake and Apple Fritter Focaccia at a time. But today? I’m letting it be Sunday – taking a break from the kitchen to peel old wallpaper from the primary bedroom.  It’s a chore, but Sunday chores go slowly. I hope this greets you on an easy morning and it’s an easy offering this week.  Take whatcha need! •  Look what got delivered to the front porch!  It’s this season’s Joy the Baker Magazine and I’ll tell you – I think it’s my best one yet! This issue is packed with new holiday recipes, food photography from the incredibly talented Karlee Flores, essays from our own Amy Estes and Abby Mallett, and a series of the best gift guides from Glynn Connolly of Oh So Gifted, and a DIY wrapping paper tutorial from Suzonne Stirling. The magazine is officially on sale next Friday but you can  grab an early copy here with 20% off using code Joy2420. (The presale discount is good until next Friday so… there’s no time to waste!) (Instagram, Magazine Shop) •  Anyone else on the verge of tears all week? If so, the 7 Ways To Love Better, a compilation of some of the most heart wrenching writing from Modern Love will tip us over the edge (she types with tears in her eyes).  (New York Times) •  I relish my solitude and I’m lucky enough to have built a life that cultivates a lot of it.  If you struggle with being alone, here’s why there’s so much grace in it:   The Beauty of Being Alone (TIME) •  A Case for Shopping at Land’s End.  Friends – I cannot stress this enough for the bedsheets and towels alone.  (New York Magazine) •  Am I slowly turning The Bakehouse into an actual bakery? Of course I am.  Currently saving for this Rofco bread oven and I think I should have this mini speed rack for Thanksgiving. (Pleasant Hill Grain, Amazon) •  A few weeks back Deb and I sat on a bench in Tompkins Square Park (which obviously brought this album to mind) and ate very hype-worthy Apollo Bagels.  Deb is one of the easiest and most interesting people to just chat because she has this way of weaving a conversation. And she has opinions about food which – I love.  If you haven’t yet listened to her podcast The Recipe with Kenji Lopez-Alt – it’s so fun.  The Caesar Salad episode is one of my favorite recent listens. (Smitten Kitchen, Spotify, Apple Podcasts) •  While we’re in podcast land, I was recently on The Ultimate Dish podcast for a lovely chat on baking, blogging, and motorcycles.  I think it’s a fun listen! (Escoffier) •  How the WNBA Became the Most Fun, Complicated, and Exciting League in Sports.  And henceforth we shall refer to the NBA (the basketball sport played by very tall men) as the MNBA, and inexplicably enrage men far and wide, mmmkay? (GQ) •  I’ve felt very stuck in the mud these last few weeks.  Call it a rut.  Call it seasonal depression – call it what you will. I took to The Internet to ask for advice and the nugget that resonated most soundly was the idea of slowing down and noticing.  I realized I was doing neither. A long evening walk with the dog just to notice is slowly working my brain free of its knots.  Noticing is the gateway to awe and Awe Can Do Wonders For Your Well Being. (Self) •  Why Movie Theater Popcorn Tastes So Good – we all know this can’t be great news but the idea of butter-flavored salt makes my tastebuds perk up.  (Mental Floss) •  In very cute, non-essential news: Mushroom Butter Storage Crock should be on our counters, right? (Amazon) •  I’ve seen this Invisible Apple Cake making the rounds on the world wide web this apple season and I’m intrigued! (Serious Eats) •  As you very well know, it’s candy corn season and I take this month of candy corn fandom very seriously.  First of all – there’s a right and wrong way to eat candy corn. Here’s the right way.  Related, highly recommend making these soft and stretchy Candy Corn and Salted Peanut Rice Krispie Treats.  (Instagram, Joy the Baker) •  A very cozy Chicken and Biscuit Pot Pie if you need a Sunday supper idea.  (Joy the Baker) •  Song on repeat this week, this very sweet version of Our House with Graham Nash and Joni Mitchell. (Spotify) My love to you, friends! xo Joy",
