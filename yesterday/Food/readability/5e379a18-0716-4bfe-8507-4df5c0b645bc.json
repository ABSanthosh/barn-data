I like when it’s dark and cozy, but I wish it was only for, like, four weeks. 5. Dirty sodas are taking over the world. I really want to try the fresca one! 6. TV things!! Ummm, that Tell Me Lies finale was insane. How are all these people so terrible! But, go Diana! And Shrinking!! Love love love. 7. Benefits of an early workout. 8. I have finished almost alllll my holiday shopping which is so freeing! I love to try and enjoy the last months of the year with low stress. I also have started making some of my gift guides on amazon and LTK! I’ll be posting them on the blog with all my wordy thoughts, but in the meantime there is a sneak peek.",
