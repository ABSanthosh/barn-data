All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Although I struggle with getting my clean laundry folded and put away, I actually like doing the laundry. I love to get those dirty loads in the washer, switch them to the dryer, and then enjoy the fresh clean clothes that come out. Not only is it a household chore with an immediate and visible result, but it’s also an actionable way that I show my love to my family. As someone who writes about cleaning for a living, I feel like I know more than many others about proper cleaning and maintenance of my washer and dryer. But a video by @alanapc clued me into something I had no idea about.In the video, part of a series entitled “This Is So Stupid That We Need to Clean This,” she touches on the typical things you’d need to check off on your washing machine maintenance checklist. But then she drops the bombshell: The interior baffles of front-load washing machines can and should be cleaned. As her voiceover highlights that 99% of her audience had never cleaned their baffles, Alana shows how she removes hers, washes them in the sink, and then scrubs the rest of the parts left in the drum of the washer. I had no clue that this could be done! To find out more, I reached out to a few appliance experts to get the full scoop. Here’s what they had to say. Is it OK to clean the baffles of a front-loading washing machine? Before doing any maintenance or cleaning to your machine, check the owner’s manuals for specific instructions that pertain to your unit. James Fleming, virtual appliance expert at Frontdoor, explains that “baffles are the paddles on the sides of the inner wash tub that move clothes during the wash cycle that contribute to gentle yet effective cleaning action.” He says that it is OK to clean your washer’s baffles “if you are able to remove them carefully without damaging them.” Division Merchandising Manager for appliances at NFM, Ivy Hofstetter, explains that “many modern washing machine models only have the visible baffle and not the substructure that would get gross,” such as the one in the video. “Those models,” she says, “don’t require a deep cleaning.” “Most baffles,” she explains, “are attached from the back side of the basket and thus not removable,” adding that “others can be removed by sliding them.” She concludes that “cleaning the baffles should be just fine as long as they’re easily removable.”Credit: KTOGRAPHY/ShutterstockHow often should the baffles be cleaned? For cleaning the drum in cases where the baffles are not removable, Hofstetter recommends running a cleaning cycle once a month or every 40 cycles with a cleaning agent of your choosing.Fleming concurs. “In a lot of cases the only way to really clean the baffles is going to be to clean the entire washer with recommended cleaning agents,” he says. “Most manufacturers will require cleaning your whole front-loading washer at least once a month. Some models will have a dedicated clean cycle and usually a manufacturer-recommended cleaning agent listed in the use and care manual.”What happens if you don’t clean them?Not cleaning your baffles results in the same issues caused by not cleaning your washer’s interior: odors, bacteria buildup, and your machine not running at peak performance. “Not cleaning the baffles will lead to a strong smell or odor over time, which can then transfer to the clothes,” explains Fleming. “Smell will result from leftover soap residue and just general use. Regular cleaning with manufacturers recommended cleaning agents will help greatly.” Regular cleaning, including that of the baffles, not only minimizes odors and bacteria, but also “will help ensure [your washing machine’s] longevity and maximize your investment,” Hofstetter encourages. How do you clean your washing machine baffles?Once again, it’s important to always check your unit’s manual for specific instructions. For units with removable baffles:  Remove the screw that attaches your baffles to the basket, if this is how your unit’s baffles are attached. Or slide them off if this is how they’re attached. Scrub the baffles with a solution of distilled white vinegar and water and a soft-bristled brush.  Reattach the baffles to the drum.  Run a cleaning cycle.",
