  "text": "Happy July! I love July. It’s hot enough to get in the pool at any hour, the days feel long and languid, and we are in the sticky slowness of summer. I’m doing my best to savor it.  Savoring feels extra important this summer. The last time I was here, I shared that I was promoted to vice principal. This time, I’m happy to share that I graduated from my Master of Fine Arts in Writing program with a degree in fiction and nonfiction. I’ve spent the past two and a half years reading and writing and submitting new work, and while it’s been a joy, I’m also really thrilled to be done and proud of what I accomplished.  Both a change in job and the end of a degree program mean that my life has shifted significantly in terms of demands on my time, my habits, and my routines. Typically, that sort of change leaves me feeling unmoored and stressed out. My tendency is to rush into the next thing and set a bunch of new goals. Don’t worry — I’m doing that, too — but I’m also taking a moment to slow down and delight in this in-between without rushing and worrying about it all. Thankfully, July is the perfect time of year to slow down and revel. I hope you’re finding ways to enjoy the big and the small things without worrying too much about what’s next.  •  One of my favorite summer traditions is keeping our chest freezer FULL of ice cream treats.

(Pact) •  A friend and I talked about corn cookies and I finally made Christina Tosi’s recipe this week and they were delicious. Recommend!

(LAKE) •  After having curly hair my entire life, my hair is suddenly straight? It’s very strange. (Substack) •  How Britney, Taylor, and Beyoncé defined the 2000s and changed pop culture forever.

(Nordstrom Rack) •  I’m hosting a party that includes a DIY charm bar in a few weeks, so I’ve been perusing HonestlyWTF’s amazing DIY projects in preparation. I also ordered this amazing kit from Bauble Bar to use. I’m excited! (HonestlyWTF, Bauble Bar) 7 Responses Congratulations on the duo of personal and professional achievements. When a person is in the midst of burn out it is hard to see it. For me personally the stuck feeling and not wanting to usher in that same feeling come 2000 I went to an industrial psychologist in April 2019. Through talking at length about my experiences professionally and the impact to me personally it became glaringly obvious I was three years into being burnt out. I did some testing and I found my way by going back to school starting January 2000. Learning filled me up. The written word and building community there changed my life. Highly recommend. I actually liked the tomato leaf candle that Trader Joe’s had this year – really smelled like my head was deep in my late July garden picking tomatoes! Congrats on the MFA and new job!! I’ve been looking at the Bauble Bar charm kit for a while but only aspire to DIY some bracelets etc so am reluctant to spend the $$. Will you share some pics of the goodness that comes from your DIY charm soiree, please?! Inspiration for us aspiring makers! Thanks, Amy!! Congrats on the MFA achievement and the promotion! Thanks for the wonderful variety of links, as always. Watermelon granitas feel like summer to me. Congrats on your new job in education. I’m just retiring from teaching after 33 years. Amy, your posts are always a perfect patchwork quilt of loveliness! Huge congratulations on your MFA \u0026 promotion! Wishing you a super summertime of slowness, sunshine, sand, sea \u0026 sips! Congratulations on the promotion AND completing your MFA! Leave a Reply This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.",
