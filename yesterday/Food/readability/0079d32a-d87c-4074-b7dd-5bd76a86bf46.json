Whether you're planning an alfresco afternoon or staying cozy indoors, these Mother's Day lunch ideas are all about fresh spring produce—think asparagus, peas, herbs, and maybe even some fiddleheads if you can find them. Keep things light and bright for a midday vibe, but don’t be afraid to splurge a little: fresh seafood, a crisp white or rosé, and a standout dessert can turn a simple lunch into something seriously special. Because when it comes to Mother’s Day, going the extra mile is always worth it. Tips for Hosting the Perfect Mother's Day Lunch Even the most casual Mother's Day lunch can feel thoughtful with a few simple touches. Whether you're cooking solo or coordinating with siblings, here are some easy tips to make the day seamless and memorable: Plan a Make-Ahead Menu: Choose recipes that can be prepped earlier in the day (or the night before), so you’re not stuck in the kitchen while everyone else is clinking glasses. Set the Scene: A pretty table makes everything feel more celebratory. Use cloth napkins, a few fresh flowers, or even some candles—it's those small touches that make Mom feel celebrated. See how we like to set a spring table here. Lean Into the Season: Showcase spring produce wherever you can—in the salad, the sides, even the dessert. It’ll keep your menu feeling fresh and cohesive. See our favorite spring recipes here. Add a Personal Touch: Whether it’s a handwritten menu, a family recipe, or a playlist of her favorite songs, those extra little details go a long way. Keep Drinks Simple but Special: A bottle of bubbly or a homemade spritz (think: lemonade + prosecco + herbs) instantly makes it feel like a party, even if you’re just eating in the backyard. We've rounded up some of our favorites here. 1. Spaghetti with Clams, Parsley, Garlic \u0026 Lemon Preserved lemons add an extra punch of lemony aroma and flavor to this fresh-as-can-be pasta dish. Serve as soon as it comes out of the pan—luckily, it’s a breeze to make. 2. Mediterranean Octopus Salad Hearty but fresh-tasting, octopus is ideal for a special-occasion lunch. Tossed with fresh lemon and parsley, it goes perfectly with a dry white wine. 3. Green Goddess Chicken Sandwiches Brightly colored green goddess sauce screams spring and adds lots of herbal flavor to grilled chicken sandwiches. Serve with homemade potato chips or potato salad. 4. Quiche, Any Way You Want It Quiche is perfectly at home on a breakfast, brunch, lunch, or dinner table, and can be served warm or at room temperature if you’re planning ahead. Customize the filling to suit Mom’s tastes. 5. Seared Sea Scallops with Gingered Pea Purée \u0026 Cilantro Gremolata Pretty pea purée not only makes an attractive canvas for seared scallops, it also provides loads of flavor along with an herbaceous gremolata. Sear the scallops just before serving. 6. Pumpernickel Focaccia with Lox \u0026 Schmear Instead of picking up bagels and lox, make this incredibly impressive focaccia and top with swirls of yogurt, smoked salmon, capers, red onion, and fresh dill. 7. Shrimp Salad on a Croissant with White Bean \"Mayo\" This fresh shrimp salad is light but satisfying, and is a real treat served on a buttery croissant. You can easily pack these sandwiches up for a picnic lunch. 8. Green Shakshuka With Cheese Swap the usual tomato sauce for green leeks, spinach, parsley, and fennel. With creamy cheese and soft-cooked eggs, this shakshuka begs for crusty bread or pita. 9. Summer Farro Salad Chewy, nutty farro makes a nice base for a main dish salad, especially when it’s tossed with a homemade vinaigrette and studded with fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, and olives. 10. Quinoa–Red Lentil Risotto With Asparagus \u0026 Peas Red lentils add protein and creaminess to this risotto-like dish, making it worthy of serving at the center of your lunch table. It also features the best of spring produce: bright green asparagus and peas. 11. Jasper White’s World-Famous Lobster Rolls Transport Mom to coastal Maine with homemade lobster rolls. You can cook the lobster and make the homemade tarragon mayonnaise up to a day ahead. 12. Salmon Burgers with Avocado Aioli Lighter than your typical burger but just as much fun to eat, these salmon burgers can be cooked on the stovetop or the grill. Don’t skip the super-creamy avocado aioli. 13. Croque Madame Hot Dish Turn the classic dish into a casserole that still has all of the best parts: béchamel, ham, Gruyère cheese, and soft bread. Top with runny eggs for extra richness. 14. Curried Smoked Turkey Salad Smoked turkey and curry powder add new layers of flavor to this spin on chicken salad. Serve it open-faced on good, toasted bread or on top of lettuce leaves. 15. Chicken \u0026 Radicchio Salad With Pickled Raisins \u0026 Walnuts Bitter radicchio is balanced by sweet pickled raisins and a tangy vinaigrette in this colorful, picture-worthy salad. Salmon can be swapped for the chicken. 16. Pan Bagnat: Le French Tuna Salad Sandwich Turn a salade Niçoise into a portable meal with this sophisticated tuna salad sandwich. Use good-quality crusty bread and scale it up if you’re serving more than two. 17. Fiddlehead Frittata Fresh fiddleheads take this easy frittata from the ordinary to the extraordinary. It’s great warm or at room temperature served with a lemony green salad. 18. Grilled Whole Branzino with \"Greek Fish Sauce\" Nothing is quite as impressive as setting a whole grilled fish on the dining room table. Branzino is flavorful but not fishy, and definitely worthy of a Mother’s Day lunch. 19. Fully Grilled Caesar Salad Kick Caesar salad up a notch by grilling the bread until toasty and the romaine lettuce until smoky but still crisp. Toss a chicken breast or two on the grill while you’re at it to round things out. 20. Steak with Arugula, Lemon \u0026 Parmesan Don’t save steak for Father’s Day—break out the red meat in honor of Mom. Served with peppery arugula, fresh lemon, and Parmesan cheese, it’s just right for a midday meal. 21. These Oysters ROCK! Oysters Rockefeller Treat Mother’s Day like a true special occasion and serve oysters Rockefeller with Champagne alongside. Add some salad and crostini and call it lunch. 22. Roasted Shrimp \u0026 Asparagus Scampi Shrimp scampi is an elegant dish that’s quick and easy to whip up and needs little to no accompaniment. Springy asparagus adds color and freshness. 23. Nelly's \"Greek Festival\" Spanakopita Filled with spinach, dill, and feta cheese, spanakopita looks beautiful on the table and will feed a crowd. Serve at room temperature, but don’t make too far ahead of time, so the phyllo stays nice and crisp. From Our Shop 24. Quiche Lorraine With Hash Brown Crust With a crispy hash brown crust, this quiche is perfect for gluten-free moms. The bacon and cheese egg custard filling is even better with a little dollop of crème fraîche on top. 25. Thai-Inspired Asparagus Salad with Fried Meyer Lemon Fresh asparagus is amped up by a Thai-inspired sauce that hits every flavor point thanks to fresh herbs and aromatics. Slice your lemons super-thin before frying for a crispy topping. 26. Pappardelle with Chicken \u0026 Lemon-Anchovy Cream Sauce Thick ribbons of pasta are coated with a deeply flavorful lemon and anchovy cream sauce and topped with chicken thighs and sun-dried tomatoes for a main dish that’s far quicker and easier than it looks or tastes. 27. Swedish-ish Meatballs Food is always a great way to show someone you care, and there’s no better dish for expressing love than handmade meatballs. Serve with sour cream and lingonberry jam. 28. Layered Salad Layered salad is a creamy, hefty dish that’s good for feeding a lunch crowd and satisfying mayo-loving moms. Use fresh spring peas if they’re available. Every great Mother's Day lunch deserves a sweet send-off. This is your moment to go beyond the usual store-bought cake and make something that feels a little more personal. Whether your mom loves something fruity, chocolatey, or custardy, there's a dessert here that’ll make her feel spoiled (as she should be). 29. Strawberry Shortcakes Layer buttery biscuits with whipped cream and macerated berries for a simple but stunning finish. 30. Lemon Olive Oil Loaf Cake Light, bright, and just a little fancy, this cake pairs perfectly with coffee or a glass of sparkling wine. 31. Chocolate Coffee Ice Cream Cake For moms who can’t live without their afternoon coffee, this ice cream cake is a dream. 32. Chocolate Pavlova with Cherries \u0026 Cream Crisp on the outside, marshmallowy in the center, and topped with fresh whipped cream and cherries—this feel restaurant-worthy, but is easier than you'd think. 33. Rhubarb \u0026 Blueberry Galette Rustic, beautiful, and bursting with tart-sweet spring flavor. What's your favorite dish to cook for Mom on Mother's Day? Let us know in the comments.
