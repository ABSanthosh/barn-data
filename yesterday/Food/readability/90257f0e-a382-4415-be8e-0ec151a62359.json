  "description": "I LOVE LISTS Let’s look at macro shots of insects. (WHOA) Let’s learn about the Smurfs. Gut-healthy Pepsi? Be the life of the party with these weather record facts. Recipes from the kitchen of Georgia O’Keeffe I love the pops of pink in this LA house. Kids surprise bus driver with flowers. Seth Godin’s notes to self. This is quite a shed! Why modern movies lack saturated colors. This dishtowel would add so much life to a kitchen. What Hulk Hogan looked like as a kid (RIP). This would have been amazing. I love that soundtrack. Unexpected animal moments. The best cheap/free ways to spend summer. The evolution of the scrollbar. You can track emoji use in realtime. Instant coffee research. What’s the palm method to picking peaches? Weekend treat: Frozen Chocolate Mousse Need a reminder of Everyday Magic? Order a zine from my shop! I send you one with some goodies.
