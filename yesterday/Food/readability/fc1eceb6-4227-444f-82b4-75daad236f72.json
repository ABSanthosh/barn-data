  "description": "Welcome to Hotline Rewind, the weekly series where we gather up your questions from the week (and pepper in some from the Hotline archives) about a specific culinary topic. We are in the countdown to Turkey Day and we can basically guarantee that there will be at least one pie on your dessert table. Pie scares a lot of people because there are two distinct components that have a lot of variables: dough and filling. But never fear, I’m here to answer your questions: Butter or shortening for crust? Both have benefits, but butter beats out shortening for two key reasons. For one, shortening doesn’t bring a lot of flavor to the party, which can work in certain instances (pot pies, more subtly flavored things, for example). But in the case of pie dough, I love the richness that butter brings. Secondly, it results in a flaker crust. Flakes occur in pastry when the water in fat is heated until it evaporates, causing flakes to disperse through the dough. And because butter has a higher water content than shortening, so it results in a lighter, slightly more delicate (in a good way) crust. Read More \u003e\u003e",

But in the case of pie dough, I love the richness that butter brings. Secondly, it results in a flaker crust. Flakes occur in pastry when the water in fat is heated until it evaporates, causing flakes to disperse through the dough. And because butter has a higher water content than shortening, so it results in a lighter, slightly more delicate (in a good way) crust. How early can you blind bake pie dough? One day in an airtight container at room temperature but in truth, I find blind baking to be a relatively painless, sub 30 minute process. Better to roll out, let freeze for up to a week, then blind bake from the freezer. What is the best canned pumpkin filling? We at Food52 are Libby’s people. They breed their own proprietary version of squash to provide a sweet, warming flavor. Be careful to use pumpkin puree instead of canned “pumpkin pie filling” which has added sugar, additives, spices and leaves little room for you to season it yourself. How long will a pie keep at room temperature? One to two days on the counter covered with foil, or in the fridge for a week. Best pie apples? My rule of thumb is 3 parts tart apples to 1 part sweet. The best baking apple for tartness is Granny Smith. For sweets, it is sort of reader’s choice, but I dig things like Fuji, Pink Lady or Snap Dragon. Think of it like wine: You shouldn’t cook with something you wouldn't eat (or in the case of vino, drink), so don’t make pie with apples you wouldn't be happy to snack on. Why do people use vinegar in pie dough? Many people think adding vinegar or vodka prevents gluten formation, which makes the pie crust a bit tougher, but this has basically been debunked. What it does prevent is oxidation, which can turn your crust greenish-gray after a few days in the fridge. That said, oxidized dough tends to bake off the same golden gorgeous color as fresh dough does. Have more holiday entertaining questions?
