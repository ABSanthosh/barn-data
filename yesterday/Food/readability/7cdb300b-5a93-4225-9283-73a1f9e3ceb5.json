While I haven’t picked a singular word to focus on, I am focusing on romanticizing my every day life. A mechanical keyboard just got delivered, its clackity sounds are oddly soothing (I do love a little ASMR moment). In the shower, I take extra time to exfoliate, moisturizing afterwards and languishing in the steam of the bathroom. Basically, I am finding ways to love the little moments of right now, because if I don’t I’ll fall apart. Do the extra little things that seem silly. Those seemingly out of the way moments are what make life full, at least I think so. Get a tea kettle and wait for the water to boil on your stove, reveling in its whistle telling you it’s time to slow down and drink tea. This morning, I picked up pastries from The Emily Hotel,  followed by a a chicken Caesar salad sandwich (oh yes) from an old Italian bakery, because why not?Honestly, it feels hard to fathom anything else right now, particularly moments of joy. This Sunday, I hope you find moments of peace, and maybe even a little bit of romance. This will be a shorter post, but a gentle launch to the start of your week.All my love to you, friends, every bit of it.• Watching the wildfires in L.A. and surrounding areas is breaking my brain and heart. My heart goes out to California and the friends and families affected, but like others I want to, NEED TO help. Whether you are near California or not, we cannot deal with this alone. Here are a few ways you can help: World Central Kitchen, California Wildlife \u0026 Disaster Relief, several options linked here, and mutual aid. AirBnb is also offering temporary housing options for people that lost their homes. (AP News, Google Docs)• Joy says this weekend needs egg salad, so this weekend needs egg salad. Period! I’m actually not a fan of egg salad, it’s a texture thing, but I respect its game. Alternatively and additionally, please make two giant chocolate chip cookies to round out the weekend nicely. (Joy the Baker)• Welcome to Cozy Girl Era, the perfect companion to Gentle January. I scored a Blogilates half zip hoodie at Target and I will be living in it. It’s stupid soft, and buttery neon green. (Target)• What the heck is going on with TikTok?? Chaos, is what. (NPR)• What are we reading this year? I’ve stopped reading what I “should” and read purely for enjoyment. I love expanding my mind with non-fiction and educational books, but I think any and all reading expands your mind, am I right? I just finished this actual sexcapade of a book by Casey McQuiston and just started this one on the recommendation of my friend Kim. (Bustle, Bookshop)• President Jimmy Carter was laid to rest this past week, may his memory be a blessing. The recounts of him from loved ones are so touching. All I keep remembering is his grandson on Claim To Fame on ABC, who affectionately called him Poppy. *sobbing* (The New Yorker)• Were you swept up in the mac n cheese craze of Thanksgiving? Thanks to TikTok star turned Gordon Ramsay’s bestie, Tini Younger, cavatappi was sold out everywhere. I tested several recipes including one that was super close to my grandmother’s and Tini’s. Both were good for different reasons – one felt ancestrally correct, but Tini? Man, can she get down in the kitchen! Her recipe uses a roux turned béchamel and I highly recommend it! (Forbes)• My girlfriend isn’t a fan of cooked fruit – she says, “Fruit should not be hot.” We are not on the same page with that, but I stumbled upon this peach-less cobbler and I must say, I’m intrigued. It looks like part cobbler, part dump cake. I’ll report back with results! (Instagram)• I think all Joy the Baker readers can attest to this – don’t tempt us with a good spiral. I am at the ready at all times. Give me a Caesar salad, French fries, and a drink? We’ll yap for hours. This week’s long read feels like a peek inside my spiraling brain – obsessing about the future. I mean, with good reason! *gestures wildly at the state of things currently* (The New Yorker)• Did you know there is an Anthropologie/Free People/Urban Outfitters outlet store? Well, there is! It’s called (Re)clectic. My girlfriend and I went last Saturday and I finally got a pair of coveted Colette pants for, get this, 29 American dollars. Alternatively, have you tried their clothing rental service, Nuuly? I specifically use it for special vacations (will definitely be using it for Ireland), and I cannot recommend it enough. You choose your pieces, they’re not chosen for you, and the options are cutecute and seemingly endless. Sizing goes up to a 3x, and is usually very spacious. If you’re new to signing up, you’ll get a discount off your first rental. Trust me, try it at least once. It’s a game changer! (Anthropologie, Nuuly)• Heavens forbid, but if you should find yourself in the midst of a disaster, this is a good guide for a preparedness bag, (Instagram)• Take a deep breath, hold it, and let it go. Repeat that while staring at this. (One Minute Park)• Finally, here’s some music that sounds like January. (YouTube) 9 ResponsesLove your posts. Life’s too short to read books that don’t bring us joy. And I’m in agreement with your girlfriend, fruit should not be warm or hot. And I’ll take it one step further and say it should only be eaten in its original form and never called dessert! Ha!I think your posts are the best! I’m here in SoCAL, one county over from the fires, but my town was on fire in early November–yes :( we are all feeling overwhelmed and helpless in the face of this. Thx for posting where to send help, but wanted to mention Iheartdogs.com because they enact rescues of dogs, flying them to available shelters, and are in the process of helping displaced dogs in the LA area, so everyone who wants to help might want to check them out. I know from almost being evacuated in Nov, that most shelters DO NOT allow dogs/pets/etc., so some were set free on the streets to roam or tied up near where people could find them–another tragedy of fast moving wildfires :( .Thanks also for posting about (Re)clectic because I love Anthropologie :) and did not know about this outlet/shop!I took a deep breath, held it, let it go and immediately started crying. Ugh this week has been too much, and the winds in SoCal are returning tomorrow. We lost our dog not even a month ago. The world around me is literally burning. And the inauguration is next week. F***k, I just cant get a break.I’m so so sorry for the loss of your pup. Everything seems relentless right now. Sometimes all we can do is keep breathing, and take it one minute at a time when one day seems too overwhelming. If you can make it through this minute, try to make it through the next, and keep going. Love to you, friendI’m right there with you, Abby, trying to bring a little bit of light into every day. Most nights, I read by the fire with a cup of rooibos. A friend gifted me ‘A Little Life’, but I’ve decided to stop torturing me myself or I might throw it in said fire. I know it’s highly praised by many, but I can’t put into words how much I hate it. I’m going to start Miranda July’s latest novel, which I’m a lot more hopeful about.I also tried to read “A Little Life” and quickly surmised the plot was “what if we took sad things, and then piled on more sad? The dessert course is also sadness.” I did not finish it either! Whew it was too muchI tried so hard to read A Little Life and just couldn’t. Right there with you! Alternatively, I just finished 2 stellar ones – All the Colors of the Dark and The God of the Woods. Happy reading!Thank you, Abby. Nice Sunday morning read :-)Yes, ‘A Merry Little Meet Cute’! Let me know how you like it.Leave a Reply This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.",

Life’s too short to read books that don’t bring us joy. And I’m in agreement with your girlfriend, fruit should not be warm or hot. And I’ll take it one step further and say it should only be eaten in its original form and never called dessert!

I’m here in SoCAL, one county over from the fires, but my town was on fire in early November–yes :( we are all feeling overwhelmed and helpless in the face of this.  Thx for posting where to send help, but wanted to mention Iheartdogs.com because they enact rescues of dogs, flying them to available shelters, and are in the process of helping displaced dogs in the LA area, so everyone who wants to help might want to check them out.  I know from almost being evacuated in Nov, that most shelters DO NOT allow dogs/pets/etc., so some were set free on the streets to roam or tied up near where people could find them–another tragedy of fast moving wildfires :( .\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks also for posting about (Re)clectic because I love Anthropologie :) and did not know about this outlet/shop!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli id=\"comment-1577277\"\u003e\u003carticle id=\"div-comment-1577277\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath, held it, let it go and immediately started crying. Ugh this week has been too much, and the winds in SoCal are returning tomorrow. We lost our dog not even a month ago. The world around me is literally burning. And the inauguration is next week.

Everything seems relentless right now. Sometimes all we can do is keep breathing, and take it one minute at a time when one day seems too overwhelming. If you can make it through this minute, try to make it through the next, and keep going.

Most nights, I read by the fire with a cup of rooibos. A friend gifted me ‘A Little Life’, but I’ve decided to stop torturing me myself or I might throw it in said fire. I know it’s highly praised by many, but I can’t put into words how much I hate it. I’m going to start Miranda July’s latest novel, which I’m a lot more hopeful about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli id=\"comment-1577284\"\u003e\u003carticle id=\"div-comment-1577284\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eI also tried to read “A Little Life” and quickly surmised the plot was “what if we took sad things, and then piled on more sad? The dessert course is also sadness.” I did not finish it either!
