It feels inevitable, honestly, given how I’ve been squinting at the corner of my garage, picturing a small bread oven tucked in there like it’s a wood-fired pizza fantasy. Sure, my garage currently houses, you know, a car, some tools, and maybe a rogue spider or two, but let’s focus on the dream: a pop-up weekend bakery. I’m not saying I’m starting a bakery tomorrow, but the dream is on simmer. Like a dough proofing in the warm Texas sun—it’s just a matter of time.In the meantime, I’ve embraced the chaos and have started collecting bakery-grade gear to casually outfit my kitchen and the sunny room just off of it. Is it excessive? Sure. Does it make me happy? Absolutely. These five items are my not-so-subtle, but very functional nod to turning my kitchen into a bakery, and I’m officially blaming my pink bakery boxes for the fact that my neighbors now casually ask, “When’s the next bake sale?”1. A 10-Tier Sheet Pan Rack (aka Speed Rack)This one is both a space-saver and an ego boost. Nothing makes you feel more like a pro baker than sliding a tray of warm chocolate cake onto one of ten glorious tiers, all while pretending you’re on the Great British Bake Off. Sure, it’s technically meant for bakeries that pump out hundreds of pastries a day, but it works equally well for holding everything from cookies to cooling cake layers—or, let’s be real, my collection of half-filled water glasses. AND – it keeps everything out of my cat Tron’s reach, amen.2. Bus Tubs (a.k.a. Wash Basins)I know, I know—bus tubs are about as glamorous as the back of a restaurant kitchen, but hear me out. These big plastic bins are essential. One tub is for dirty dishes (it makes cleanup feel like a fun stacking challenge), and the other is for prepping dough or tossing trash and flour-covered utensils in mid-bake. They’re sturdy, they’re unassuming, and they basically let me pretend I’m running a bakery with an actual staff instead of just me, frantically trying not to over proof my bread while also walking the dog.3. Baker’s Math Kitchen ScaleForget measuring cups; this kitchen scale is the boss of all things dough-related. It’s not just about precision; it’s about feeling like a scientist in the middle of a butter-and-sugar experiment. I weigh everything now—flour, water, even chocolate chips—because if I’m going to turn out bakery-level treats, I need to channel bakery-level math and this is the exact scale I used in professional kitchens.4. Restaurant-Quality Butcher Block Work TableThis table is where all the magic happens. It’s enormous, it’s sturdy, and it’s the kind of surface that can handle everything from kneading sticky dough to rolling out sugar cookies for holiday tins. Honestly, I think this table has more work ethic than I do—it just sits there, ready for action, while I’m over here debating whether to eat a cookie or make one.  And the grand plan is to hold baking classes around the giant work table come springtime!5. Pink Bakery Boxes and TwineBecause let’s be real, presentation is half the fun. These boxes are unapologetically cute, and the twine adds that perfect little I totally planned this touch. Whether I’m packing up leftover pie slices for neighbors or sending a stack of cookies to a friend, these boxes scream “bakery chic.”So there you have it—five things that have me well on my way to turning my Bellville kitchen into a full-fledged bakery. It’s a little over the top, sure, but so is life in this big ol’ Victorian house. And if you’re wondering whether I’ll add a sixth item to this list, the answer is yes: a bread oven for my garage. Let’s dream big, friends. 9 ResponsesI just order a scale. My last one just happened to be on a stove top when l turned on the burner. In the spring I’ll give it a decent burial as it had served me well. I’ve been using scales since I started reading cooking blogs some 20+ years ago.Great post Joy. A scale is an essential if you bake. I’m on a mission to convert North Americans from baking by volume to baking by weight, one baker at a time! I love my speed rack too!Those of us in Bellville who pass your house daily, would love for you to make your kitchen into a bakery! Maybe have a class or two and share your talents with the community. Welcome, Joy!I wish I had room in my kitchen for that 10-pan baker’s rack. So excited to hear there may be classes in the not so distant future!!I love my kitchen scale. It really helps with baking \u0026 most all other recipes too! I also love that cute hot pad (may be a trivet?) in your ingredients picture. Can you tag it for us or is it homemade?Enjoy the Season! Julie MI agree about the bakery boxes. So much better than tupperware for sharing!Lol…..I don’t run a bakery; but I have a bakers rack for soap to cure on. A scale to weigh oils to make soap. Bus tubs because they are so very handy everywhere. A stainless steel restaurant work table. Now if I only had pretty pink boxes………people should shop at restaurant supply stores more often!Love this! Sunshine, baking, a ten-tier sheet pan rack, and boxes tied with twine. Heaven!This all sounds great! I’ve been thinking about a food scale so I’m putting yours in the cart!.

Whether I’m packing up leftover pie slices for neighbors or sending a stack of cookies to a friend, these boxes scream “bakery chic.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr/\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo there you have it—five things that have me well on my way to turning my Bellville kitchen into a full-fledged bakery. It’s a little over the top, sure, but so is life in this big ol’ Victorian house. And if you’re wondering whether I’ll add a sixth item to this list, the answer is yes: a bread oven for my garage. Let’s dream big, friends.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003csection id=\"comments\" data-id=\"cd0599c\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"post-comments.theme_comments\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003e 9 Responses\u003c/h2\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli id=\"comment-1572937\"\u003e\u003carticle id=\"div-comment-1572937\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eI just order a scale. My last one just happened to be on a stove top when l turned on the burner. In the spring I’ll give it a decent burial as it had served me well. I’ve been using scales since I started reading cooking blogs some 20+ years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli id=\"comment-1572862\"\u003e\u003carticle id=\"div-comment-1572862\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreat post Joy.\u003cbr/\u003e A scale is an essential if you bake.

A scale to weigh oils to make soap.  Bus tubs because they are so very handy everywhere.  A stainless steel restaurant work table.  Now if I only had pretty pink boxes………people should shop at restaurant supply stores more often!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli id=\"comment-1572644\"\u003e\u003carticle id=\"div-comment-1572644\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eLove this!
