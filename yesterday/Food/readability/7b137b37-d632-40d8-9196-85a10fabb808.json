All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: alexandre zveiger/shutterstockThe reality of moving to a new city — and state, for that matter — wasted no time hitting me at every painful design angle. My beloved bar cabinet needed a new home, my sofa required a visit from the Couch Doctor if I wanted to see it in my next place, and my relationship with closet space and hangers demanded serious reevaluation, as I’d be parting ways with a walk-in closet. Talk about a bad breakup.After taking a good look at my smaller closet and an even better look at the hangers that didn’t fit on my new clothing rack (did I mention it was a bad breakup?), it was time to get strategic with my new space while finding a way to still keep it stylish. Once my jeans and workout attire were organized in dresser drawers, I had to find an affordable solution for my sweaters, shirts, and everything in between.Luckily, these Nature Smile 5-in-1 Anti-Slip Metal Hangers from Amazon are living up to that challenge and more.Think of one sturdy hanger with anti-slip shoulders, multiply it by five, and further imagine them vertically stacked on the separate rods of one large hook. Thanks to their vertical alignment, I’ve successfully expanded my closet’s horizontal horizons all without disrupting my shoe storage. I no longer need to hang my blouses on a clothing rack, or measure the space underneath my entertainment console to see how many sweaters I can squeeze there.Each separate hanger also detaches from its rod-and-hook foundation, allowing you to easily add or remove items. I was officially sold on these hangers when I learned you could hook the separate hangers onto either side of their foundation — a convenient feature depending on which direction you prefer your clothes face — and also when I discovered that one order includes two full sets. Ten hangers that take up the space of two, all for $18? I’ll take three more!Not only are these hangers functional, they’re amazingly sleek, too. The large anti-rust hook has a smooth, chrome surface that matches the tone of its separate steel hangers, allowing your clothes to have a clean and attractive base to hang from. They’re stylish on their own, but definitely don’t distract from your clothes. These hangers have returned an incredible amount of room to my closet, while inspiring plenty of aesthetically pleasing styling and organizing opportunities I didn’t consider before including color-coding racks, having hangers match each other, and even painting the closet interior. As I look toward organizing my coat closet, where I’ll be up against a small amount of space once again, I’ll first be grabbing a beverage from my new bar setup, taking a seat on my sofa after a successful surgery by the Couch Doctor, and pressing “Place your order” on my next round of these Amazon hangers. I guess there’s something good that comes out of every bad breakup. This post originally ran on Apartment Therapy. See it there: This 5-in-1 Organizer Creates Instant Storage Space in My Closet (It’s a Saving Grace!)",
