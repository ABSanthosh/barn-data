All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Patty CatalanoGrocery prices are high, so finding ways to shop smart and stick to my budget is at the top of my to-do list in 2025. One of the ways I do that is by shopping at Costco. Buying in bulk requires a long-range budgeting strategy that’s a little different than clipping coupons from your neighborhood grocer. I’ve been a Costco member for over a decade, so I have experience stocking up on staples, anticipating sales, and knowing the label lingo. I’ve learned how to avoid impulse buys and stick to the products Costco sells at competitive prices. Usually bulk-buying means paying more upfront, but I’ve found a dependable item in Costco’s produce department that allows me to stock up without breaking the bank. There might not be a better deal in the entire warehouse than Costco’s three-pound bunches of Del Monte bananas. That’s just one reason why I buy them every — yes, every — week.What’s So Great About Del Monte Bananas?It comes down to cost and convenience. These bananas are sold in three-pound bunches for just $1.49. The number and size of the bananas in each bundle varies, but I usually find it contains at least eight medium bananas. That breaks down to just 19 cents per banana. (Trader Joe’s famously used to sell bananas for the same price, but increased it in 2024 to 23 cents per banana.)Costco’s bananas are often sold slightly less ripe than those displayed at other grocers. For me, that’s a win; I prefer a slightly underripe banana for eating out of hand, so that gives me plenty of time to enjoy the fruit as it is before they’re too soft. With so many bananas in the bunch, it’s easy to designate a few for eating straight from the peel and others for breakfast, snack, and dessert recipes throughout the week. (One thing that I don’t worry about is how to store the bananas or what to do with them once they’re past their prime, because The Kitchn has done the research already.)What’s the Best Way to Enjoy Del Monte Bananas?Find it in stores: Del Monte Bananas, $1.49 for 3 poundsWhat Costco produce do you buy on repeat?
