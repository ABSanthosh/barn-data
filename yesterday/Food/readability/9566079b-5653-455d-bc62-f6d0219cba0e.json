  "text": "A peek at everything I loved in April 2025! FOOD Caprese cottage cheese toast in Easy Everyday. I could truly eat this… everyday! Can’t get enough. Gomacro bars. My favorite find of the month! Chobani birthday cake creamer. I don’t go crazy over flavored creamers like I did in my 20s,  but this one is SO good. It truly tastes like birthday cake. Best iced latter ever. Dill pickle pistachio snack packs. Was very excited to find these since the salt and vinegar ones are a snack staple. HOME Waterproof outdoor rug. I have one of these on our deck and it’s the best. White serving trays. ‘Tis the season for outdoor entertaining! I got these to carry food out for our dinners on the deck and I love ’em! Stone car coasters. I probably mentioned these way back in the day, but they are something I can’t live without in my car. They instantly absorb any liquid and they are great if you like to get iced coffee. Gel car air freshener. Speaking of car things, I stick one of these under my seat and love it. It doesn’t have a strong fragrance but it does absorb odors. Perfect for the sports/kid mobile. BEAUTY Georgio Armani liquid blush. The cool pink and coral pinch have been in my rotation constantly. Sometimes I use both and mix them! Laneige Glaze Craze lip balm in strawberry sprinkles. Adore how foolproof and cool toned this is. I want one in every bag. Ouai St Bart’s leave in conditioner. Emilia and I both have been using this. It smells so wonderful – such a good summer scent. Dry Bar big hair besties. My current favorite velcro rollers. They give so much volume up top! FASHION Oura ring. This is a repeat fave but I LOVE my ring. It’s ugly and I hate how it looks, but it tells me so much useful info. I adore it. Frame slim palazzo jeans. I hate that I’m listing another expensive item here but let me tell you… best jeans I’ve tried in YEARS. I probably haven’t bought a pair I loved in 10 years. This is it!!! They are so stretchy and soft. Straw sweatband visor. Funny I’m listing this in “fashion” too… but these are my favorite visors since they have removable sweatbands. They are awesome! MEDIA Ransom Canyon. I’m such a sucker for soapy dramas like this. It’s like Yellowstone + Virgin River. I loved it! Great Big Beautiful Life. No surprise here… Emily Henry’s new book was definitely my favorite of the month! It’s so good. KIDS Kids slip on sneakers. Jordan LOVES these because he can so easily slip them on himself. They are his play shoes for outside and definitely his favorites. Giant Connect 4. The kids got this for Easter to have out by the pool. It’s one of their favorite games so we are super pumped! Polarized sunglasses. Max and Emilia don’t really go outside without sunglasses. I always get each a pair + one extra so we always have them on hand! Their eyes are sensitive and they love these ones. [none of this is sponsored, i just love to tell you what i love every month! there are a few general affiliate links above! xo]",
