Credit...Heather Willensky for The New York TimesPriya KrishnaPriya Krishna spent several days following importers around New Jersey as they received and delivered mangoes.June 23, 2025Updated 1:31 p.m. ETThe mangoes were supposed to be here two hours ago.Yakin Shah paced the parking lot of a cargo warehouse at Newark Liberty International Airport, beads of sweat moistening his scruffy beard and clouding his aviator glasses. His fingers clutched a stylus, obsessively swiping his phone for any update that his precious fruit had cleared customs.He awaited 800 boxes of mangoes that had flown in the night before from a warehouse in Pune, India, with a stopover in Dubai. Nearly all had been presold to customers and stores in the area through Swadesi Mangoes, Mr. Shah’s side gig when he’s not running a convenience store in Kearny, N.J.But when the mangoes finally arrived, he saw that they hadn’t been refrigerated. Condensation from the delicate fruit had soaked the perforated boxes, and several had been crushed in the tight confines of the shipping container. The golden kesar mangoes from Gujarat, known for their shiny hue, were discolored and spotted. The Alphonsos, an ultra-sweet breed from Maharashtra, were mushy.ImageYakin Shah, a mango importer, visits Newark Liberty International Airport at least once a week to receive shipments of Indian mangoes. Credit...Heather Willensky for The New York TimesThe air smelled of sweet nectar and burned rubber, of primal ripeness on the edge — an intimation of the allure and risk involved in bringing India’s most prized fruit to its eager diaspora.The business is brutal. Mangoes are fragile, and the window to sell them is vanishingly short. The customers are finicky and demanding. Profit margins are slim. And the competition can be ruthless — nowhere more so than in New Jersey, home to one of the nation’s largest populations of Indian immigrants, and to dozens of importers who have turned Indian mango season, which runs from around April to late June, into a free-for-all.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
