All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Photo: Alex Lepe ; Food Styling: Rachel PerlmutterWhen I think about making bread, I’m always intrigued, but it usually turns into intimidation when I open up a complicated-looking recipe. That’s why I never got on the bread-making bandwagon like everyone else seemed to during the pandemic. It just seemed too tricky, even though plenty of people have told me that the task isn’t as hard as it seems — and the results are totally worth it, of course. (After eating my grandma’s homemade bread on multiple occasions, I can confirm as much.)Still, I have yet to make my own loaf, but I think that might change if I snag the latest item to earn a spot on my wish list. You might’ve seen one of KBS’ bread makers going viral on TikTok last year; it’s no wonder why it got so many likes, because it turns bread making into a mind-bogglingly easy process. Walmart has majorly discounted the price of KBS’ 19-in-1 Bread Maker, which has over 800 five-star reviews. Many of them praise its simple design, with one reviewer even calling it “the best machine ever.” If you want perfect loaves every time without the hassle, here’s why you should add this machine to your cart before the sale ends.What Is the KBS 19-in-1 Bread Maker?Yep, you really did read that correctly: This bread maker has an impressive 19 functions. Those include French, Whole Wheat, kneading and fermentation, Jam, Yogurt, Cake, Pizza Dough, Gluten-Free, and more. There’s even a setting to bake a loaf, whether it’s 1 pound or two, in just an hour and a half. It’s able to do that thanks to the 710-watt high power motor that kneads quickly and gets the dough to perfect consistency all by itself. Despite its strength, the machine emits less than 40 decibels of noise so it won’t bother you overnight.The bread maker also allows you control over add-ins — there’s even a detachable dispenser that releases fruit and nuts into the mixture at the best time. You can watch the entire process happen through the viewing window, and select the cycle, crust, and loaf size via the digital panel. Considering all of that and the delay and keep warm functions, there’s pretty much zero chance that your bread ends up anything but amazing.What Walmart Shoppers Are Saying “Adjustment of the bread maker was really easy, and I have tried whole-grain bread, white bread, and oat flour bread so far, and they have all turned out amazing. I will be trying more, but for sure I am done with store-bought breads. Who needs bread from outside when you have an amazing bread maker at home!” — Mimi “This bread maker is a great all-in-one. I just put the ingredients in, and it did all the work for me! The bread came out soft in the middle with a nice light crust. I was able to adjust the controls to make softer crust for sandwich bread, too. It’s easy to use for the whole family.” — ddliserio “This is one of the must have appliances in every kitchen. Quick installation, easy to use and works great. Now I know what goes into my bread I eat. I have four ingredients in my bread I make while the store-bought bread has a long paragraph of ingredients. Highly recommend.” — Lyla If you’ve been a bit hesitant to take the bread-making plunge like me, or you simply want homemade bread without so much hassle, then this deal is for you. Plus, at under $100, it makes for an excellent gift. You (or your giftee) are pretty much guaranteed to use it every week, if not every day.Buy: KBS 19-in-1 Bread Maker, $94.98 (normally $169.99)My Kitchn HelperGet our favorite editor-tested and -approved finds sent twice a week to your inbox.",
