You see your walls every day, so why not make them fun to look at? Even better, why not make them functional as well? Credit: Photo: Ghazalle Badiozamani; Props: Morgan SmithDIY-er and mom-of-two Armelis Dorville set out to do both in her twins’ room. She wanted to turn one corner of the space into an “entryway” of sorts — a fun, welcoming space for her kids to store their things and encourage them to keep their space organized themselves. She envisioned a dramatic sloping angle that carves out a bright, sunshine-yellow triangle where before there was just an empty corner. She used ScotchBlue PROSharp Painter’s Tape to mark out the design. It delivers the brand’s sharpest paint lines yet thanks to their new Edge-Lock+ technology, which provides 2x better hold than their original Edge-Lock technology. Working with a bright color and a straight line like this, Armelis knew the precision of the line would make or break the project. Learn how to replicate her project yourself, and put your walls to work!Tools Needed1. Prep Your Space2. Measure and Tape Off the Area with ScotchBlue PROSharp Painter’s TapeDetermine where and at what heights you want your diagonal to begin and end, measuring and marking as you go with the pencil. Armelis based hers on her kids’ heights, so that each hook will be right at eye level for each of them. She’ll install hooks along the line at the end to hold her kids’ things, so they need to be able to reach them easily.Next, use your ScotchBlue PROSharp Painter’s Tape to define the area. To get the crisp edges you’ll need for this design, press down on the tape as you apply it to create a tight seal. You’ll also want to tape off the top of your baseboards to protect them. Your 3M’s Hand-Masker Dispenser can come in handy again here, helping adhere the tape to that thin seam using the putty-knife end.3. Start PaintingFinally, time to start painting! Armelis chose a bright, sunny yellow hue for her twins, but you can choose any color you please. We recommend something bright for a project like this, to help define the space. Use your paintbrush to work paint into tricky areas and tight spaces, and use the roller to cover larger swaths at a time.Credit: Photo: Ghazalle Badiozamani; Props: Morgan Smith4. Remove Your TapeThe moment of truth! Make sure the paint is dry to the touch. Using a putty knife or razor blade, you can score along the edge of the tape to prevent paint from being pulled up. Be patient with this step: Slowly and gently lift the painter’s tape and pull it back on itself, removing at a 45-degree angle. If you need to leave the tape longer, ScotchBlue PROSharp Painter’s Tape has a 21-Day Clean Removal guarantee, meaning you can leave it up to three weeks to remove it thanks to its UV-resistant acrylic adhesive. Now take a moment to admire that crisp, clean line and your sparkling clean baseboards!Credit: Photo: Ghazalle Badiozamani; Props: Morgan SmithAnd there you have it! Armelis added a few wall hooks just underneath the line of the yellow zone where her kids would start hanging their things. Don’t forget to admire your handiwork, and remember that whether it’s your first time painting anything or you’re an old pro with the roller, you can count on professional lines every time with ScotchBlue PROSharp Painter’s Tape.",
