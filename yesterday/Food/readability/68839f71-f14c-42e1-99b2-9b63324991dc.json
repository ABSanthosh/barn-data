On any given day you might find her working on a freelance photo or blogging gig, wrangling her little darling, or walking Chuck the boxer.updated yesterdayWe independently select these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Oven racks: The biggest, hunkiest, most annoying things to clean in the kitchen. Scrubbing them requires a certain finesse, because all those wires can send gunky soap slime flying, but also lots of elbow grease. (So, work delicately but with vigor?). Plus, they’re cumbersome, too, so they probably don’t fit in your sink, which means you’ll need to find another place to clean them. And the longer you wait, the dirtier they get — could it be more annoying?For my latest experiment, I set out to find the best (and easiest!) way to clean oven racks. I figured, with a clear winner, people might actually clean their racks every three months (that’s the recommended frequency!). I tested four popular methods, and got very mixed results, but ultimately found a reliable contender that really works. Read on to learn how to clean oven racks with minimal effort.What Is the Best Way to Clean Oven Racks? Make a paste using Bar Keepers Friend and water, and paint it on the front and back sides of the oven racks with a brush. Let the paste sit for 45 minutes, then rinse using a scrubby sponge and warm, soapy water. How We Tested the Different Oven Rack Cleaning MethodsI found four promising methods to test, which meant I needed to gather four oven racks. I pulled the two out of my own oven and borrowed two equally dirty ones from a neighbor. Then, I got to work taking pictures and detailed notes on each method.The ratings: Each method received a 1 to 5 rating; 5 being the best method overall, and 1 being the least favorite method. Along with the rating, you’ll find notes on how easy or difficult the method was, how much elbow grease it took, how long it took to clean, and my general thoughts.Oven Rack Cleaning Method: Dryer Sheets + Dishwasher Detergent Total time: Overnight (up to 12 hours) Rating: 2 / 5 The method: Lay an old towel in the bottom of a bathtub (to protect the surface from any scratches), and line it with a few rows of dryer sheets (so that they’re about the size of the oven rack). Place the racks on top of the dryer sheets. Fill the bath with just enough hot water to cover the racks, and dissolve 1/2 cup of liquid or powder dishwasher detergent in the water. Let the racks soak overnight, then use the dryer sheets to wipe the racks, removing grease and food particles. Rinse the racks with clean, soapy water.How it went: The dryer sheets are supposed to dilute the bond and soften baked-on food, making cleaning a breeze. While they were able to get the racks looking decent (even shiny in some parts), the really tough stuck-on grime didn’t come off easily at all.I decided to try using a scrubby sponge to see if that would help, and it did, but there wasn’t enough of an impact for me to consider it a good-enough method to use in the future. (Also, I know plenty of people who try to avoid dryer sheets, so I also considered that in the final rating.)Oven Rack Cleaning Method: Dishwasher Detergent Total time: Overnight (up to 12 hours) Rating: 3 / 5 The method: Lay an old towel in the bottom of a bathtub, place the oven rack on top, then dissolve about 1/2 cup of liquid or powder dishwasher detergent in a warm bath. Let the oven rack soak overnight, then rinse clean with a scrubby sponge and water.How it went: This method is virtually the same as the first one, only it doesn’t call for dryer sheets, so I was interested to see how it would go. The soaking part worked just as well, but the scrubby sponge was definitely better at removing baked-on food from the racks than the dryer sheets.I think it’s safe to say using a dryer sheet in the cleaning process isn’t necessary. This method without dryer sheets is great if your oven racks aren’t super dirty and you have the time to let them soak overnight. Just be sure you have a good scrubbing sponge, and be ready to use some elbow grease!Oven Rack Cleaning Method: Trash Bag + Easy-Off Oven Cleaner Total time: 50 minutes (5 active minutes) Rating: 4 / 5 The method: Place your oven rack inside a big trash bag and set it in the sink or on the ground outside. Spray the grates liberally with Easy-Off oven cleaner from at least 9 to 12 inches away. Close up the bag and let it sit for up to 45 minutes. Then, use paper towels to scrub the gunk off the rack. Rinse with warm, soapy water.How it went: I carefully pulled the top side of the garbage bag open, grabbed a roll of paper towels, and began wiping away the gunk that had bubbled up on the oven racks. Easy-Off is a fan favorite, and it’s clear why — it takes little to no effort to get rid of grime after you’ve given the product time to work its magic.I wanted to give this method a 5 because it really does work wonders, but my preferred method is up next, because it’s nowhere near as fume-y and doesn’t require an aerosol can.Oven Rack Cleaning Method: Bar Keepers Friend Total time: 1 hour (5 active minutes) Rating: 5 / 5 The method: Make a paste using Bar Keepers Friend and water. The paste shouldn’t be too thick or too thin, rather, you’re looking for a peanut butter consistency. Use a basting brush to paint the paste on the front and back sides of the oven racks. Let the paste sit for 45 minutes, then rinse clean using a scrubby sponge and warm, soapy water. How it went: This method is a bit messy (the paste will drip), but holy cow, it works wonders! It ended up being my favorite method because it was easy and cleaned with very minimal effort. I loved that it took just under an hour and only called for about 5 minutes of active scrubbing time. I did make this work in my sink, but you can also do it in the tub or even outside. The best part? You can use the Bar Keepers Friend to clean your tub afterwards!How do you usually clean your oven racks? Let us know in the comments below!",
