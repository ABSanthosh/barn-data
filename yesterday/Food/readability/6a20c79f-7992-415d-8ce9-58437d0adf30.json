So let National Hot Chocolate Day be your sign to melt it down into something even better—maybe a spicy, minty, or even boozy twist on a classic cup. With that in mind, we've rounded up our favorite hot chocolate recipes, from a decadent drinking chocolate to a caramelized white chocolate and even a matcha-rose version.

It makes perfect sense though: It’s cold out, and you’re probably still holding on to a fancy chocolate bar from the holidays. So let National Hot Chocolate Day be your sign to melt it down into something even better—maybe a spicy, minty, or even boozy twist on a classic cup. With that in mind, we've rounded up our favorite hot chocolate recipes, from a decadent drinking chocolate to a caramelized white chocolate and even a matcha-rose version. Sure, a packet works in a pinch, but trust us when we say these homemade versions (or even whipping up your own mix) are worth it. Bonus: We’ve also sprinkled in some desserts inspired by the same flavors, like this halva bread pudding and these Swedish fluff cookies, because why just drink your hot chocolate when you can eat it too? And if the thought of a build-your-own hot chocolate bar is already crossing your mind, we’re right there with you. Add some of Alice Medrich’s dark chocolate whipped cream or homemade vanilla marshmallows for the sweetest finishing touch. 1. Cardamom Hot Chocolate Simmer dark chocolate, vanilla, and cardamom pods for a rich, spiced base that’s perfectly cozy. Finish it off with whipped cream, a sprinkle of ground cardamom, cinnamon, or any other warming spices you love. 2. Hot Chocolate Demitasses This recipe proves that great hot chocolate starts with great chocolate. With just milk, water, and your favorite semisweet or bittersweet, you’ll have a bakery-worthy cup of cocoa. 3. Caramelized White Hot Chocolate If you think that white chocolate lacks the depth of dark, this caramelized version might just change your mind. It’s a little different than your usual mix, but just as smooth and creamy. You can either buy it caramelized ahead of time or make your own. 4. Irish Hot Chocolate Don’t let its looks deceive you—this drink is as strong as it is sweet. Dark cocoa and chocolate get amped up with Guinness, whiskey, and a splash of Irish cream liqueur. It’s the perfect pick for a nightcap or a snowy day in. 5.Milk Chocolate Cocoa Erin Jeanne McDowell has a recipe for just about every kind of sweets fan (including an extra-dark one for the purists) but you can't go wrong with this version. With a high-quality bar like Valrhona, you’ll get a rich, creamy cup that’s not too sweet. 6. Hot \u0026 Cold Chocolate According to Dorie Greenspan, the perfect from-scratch version is just three pantry staples and 10 minutes away. For that signature frothy texture, just like at Ladurée, blend it on high speed for a few minutes. Bonus: She also shares how to make a cold version that doubles as an ice cream float. 7. White Matcha Rose Hot Chocolate For matcha lovers, our food stylist Anna Billinskog created a white hot cuppa that you’ll want to sip all the way into spring. The matcha not only gives it a lovely pale green hue, but also makes it lighter and frothier than your average hot chocolate. 8. Champurrado (Mexican Hot Chocolate) Champurrado is a rich, warm chocolate drink from Mexico, thickened with masa and spiced with chipotle powder. This recipe also uses brown sugar as the base, simmered with cinnamon sticks for extra warm winter flavors. 9. Oat Milk Hot Chocolate Even if you aren’t dairy-free, you’ll want to try this one. Using creamy oat milk as a base makes it extra thick, and adds a subtle oat flavor that balances the sweetness. 10. Homemade Hot Cocoa Mix For the times when you’re craving a mug of hot cocoa but don’t want to grab a cutting board or turn on the stove, this mix is the perfect solution. And yes, you can make a mix that doesn't turn watery. Simply blend blended bittersweet chocolate with dark cocoa powder, then add a pinch of cinnamon or espresso powder for an extra kick. 11. Hot Chocolate Toddy Another boozy option, laced with notes of citrus-vanilla, coconut, and cardamom. It has that cozy, spiced winter flavor, but the coconut rum adds a touch of tropical warmth. Plus, a splash of Licor 43 sweetens it up (and makes it a little stronger too). 1. Panetón \u0026 Hot Chocolate Bread Pudding If you thought panettone was just for Christmas morning, think again. This recipe gives the beloved holiday bread a South American twist: cake soaked in a spiced cocoa custard and drizzled with extra sauce (and maybe a splash of pisco—because why not?) 2. Hot Chocolate Fluff Cookies Nea from our Test Kitchen put a hot chocolate spin on classic Swedish Mum Mums. It starts with a basic gingerbread cookie then gets a toasted marshmallow fluff piped inside. Then the entire thing gets dipped in—what else?—chocolate. 3. Hot Cocoa Cake This cake is essentially hot cocoa in dessert form—fluffy, chocolatey, and topped with a cloud of peppermint-marshmallow frosting. The ganache drizzle takes it over the top and melts into the cake and frosting. 4. Peppermint Hot Cocoa Cookies Who says peppermint has to disappear after the holidays? They’re refreshingly minty, but you can easily skip the candy for a pure chocolate vibe. 5. Hot Chocolate \u0026 Halva Pudding This isn’t your average chocolate cake—it’s better. Like so many of Great British Bake-Off star Benjamina Ebuehi’s creations, it’s all about comfort and simplicity. It swaps traditional frosting for a homemade sticky chocolate sauce that gives it that signature hot cocoa flavor. What’s the best hot chocolate you’ve ever had? Let us know in the comments!",
