All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Chris Jackson/Getty ImagesWhen dreaming up what celebrities eat often, it’s easy to assume they indulge in extravagant foods like luxurious Wagyu beef or fancy farm-to-table spreads. However, time and again, we realize that many of them prefer to keep their diets simple. For example, Kylie Jenner enjoys eating pomegranate every day, while Selena Gomez loves having chorizo eggs for breakfast. The trend is simple: Famous people often choose convenient foods that fit their busy lifestyles.In a recent interview with GQ, Robert Pattinson discussed his go-to weekly meals, and his response proves that celebrities tend to prefer a straightforward diet. “I realized I’ve eaten nothing but salmon for like, months. It’s like I have a seal’s diet,” Pattinson said. “I genuinely have been eating salmon three times a day.”Pattison’s fans raced to social media to analyze his kitchen habits. GQ posted about the interview on Instagram, and one person commented, “Thank God he’s back with another food interview.” Another user called out, “Salmon is amazing. It’s my favorite fish. I try to eat it at least once a week. But three times a day, though? Hmm.”While the actor didn’t explain why or how he prefers to eat his salmon, he did mention that in the past, he had a canned tuna obsession and would douse it with “Cholula hot sauce” for a flavor boost. In terms of other hot takes, Pattison also mentioned that while he can’t handle energy drinks like Celcius, he reaches for instant coffee at the beginning of each day. “My favorite thing is instant coffee, more than anything else,” he says. “I’m kind of like a kid. I’m doing a lot of jobs in a row, and I get very obsessed about needing to have regimented behavior — otherwise, I’d feel crazy afterwards.”",
