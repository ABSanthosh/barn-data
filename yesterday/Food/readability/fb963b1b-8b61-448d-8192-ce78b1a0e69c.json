All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Joe Lingeman/KitchnI have a confession to make: I rely on quick and easy meals during the week. Maybe one day I’ll muster enough energy after work to spend a couple of hours at the stove, but until that day comes, I’m all for tools that’ll make my life more relaxed — and my microwave is chief among them. I unashamedly love a microwavable meal that I don’t even have to think about. Besides, you can make a surprising number of solid dishes in the microwave, from baked potatoes to cake to bacon. I find that it almost feels more satisfying when I put in low effort and end up with something that’s totally delicious.However, I’ll admit that sometimes the result can be hit or miss if you use a regular bowl or plate. That’s where Anyday comes in, with its microwavable cookware that ensures food comes out perfectly every time. At first, I was skeptical that it really could do everything it claimed. (My jaw dropped when I saw the recipes on Anyday’s website. Banana bread? Chicken pot pie? How?!) But after introducing the Everyday Set into my daily routine, I believe it. I’ve used the bowls for every meal at this point, and now I don’t know how I could ever go without them, especially in my tiny kitchen. Keep reading to learn why and how exactly I’ve put them to the test.What is Anyday’s Everyday Set?Anyday’s cookware is built with microwave-safe glass and stainless steel, which is toxin-free. (You won’t find any chemicals or micro-plastics seeping into your food.) Since 2021, the company has produced dishes designed to cook your food from scratch in record time. You can take guidance from all of the recipes on its website. Just gather the ingredients, follow the instructions, toss everything in the bowl, put the lid in place, and let the microwave do most of the heavy lifting. Then, you can take the dish — which looks beautiful with its frosted glass — to the table and serve. If you have leftovers, you can slide the lid back on top and place the bowl in the freezer. The cookware doubles as airtight, leakproof, and stackable storage containers.The Everyday Set includes a range of sizes to tackle a number of tasks. The Large Shallow one offers a 7-cup capacity, ideal for things like chicken, fish, and bacon. The Large Deep is 8 cups and is suited for rice, pasta, and one-dish meals. For sides and smaller portions, the 4-cup Medium Shallow is best for eggs and desserts. Last but not least, the Medium Deep’s 4-cup capacity and shape are great for broccoli, potatoes, and dips. Each one comes with a steam-trapping matching lid, which has a vented handle on top to release pressure.Why I Love the Everyday SetAs a self-proclaimed easy meal lover, I’m mad at myself for how long it took me to discover Anyday. (I seriously could’ve used it in my college dorm room!) However, it’s better late than never. In fact, recently, these dishes have been seeing more action than ever. I have an ankle injury and am hobbling around my apartment on crutches. The last thing I want to do is balance on one leg for hours in the kitchen. Instead, I’ve been using these miracle gadgets for everything. I follow Anyday’s easy-to-understand recipes to a T, and every time, they deliver. Instead of taking an hour to preheat the microwave and wait for my potato to bake, it’s ready to go in 10 minutes.These dishes have also inspired me to eat breakfast more consistently, too. As simple as making scrambled eggs is on the stove, the cleanup isn’t all that fun. I’ve taken to whipping them up in the microwave, and instead of washing a bowl, plate, and pan, all I have to do is scrub a single dish. Plus, I think my eggs come out just as (if not more) fluffy and perfect in the microwave. Sometimes, I’ll follow up scrambled eggs with bacon — and the process is completely splatter-free and done in about five minutes. Somehow, I’m still shocked every time that the pieces come out crispy.I decided to go a step further, beyond the basics of scrambled eggs and steamed veggies, and try my hand at Anyday’s shrimp scampi. The recipe calls for two minutes of prep and two minutes in the microwave. Since it’s so easy to overcook, I was a bit worried at first, but I should’ve known better. The sauce was tasty and simple, and the shrimp’s consistency wasn’t rubbery in the slightest. What’s helpful is that Anyday’s online instructions allow you to input your microwave’s wattage and desired serving size. Once you do, it tells you which size of dish to use.For my next dish, I decided to test how well the bowls handled baking. Banana bread is one of my favorite fall recipes, so when I saw that Anyday had a recipe, I hurried to get all the ingredients together. Understandably, prep is a bit more laborious for something like this, requiring a separate mixing bowl and eight minutes of putting it all together. The biggest difference is in the baking time. Rather than taking an hour in the oven, 10 minutes in the microwave produced moist banana bread almost on par with others I’ve made the regular way.I can’t wait to make more cozy fall meals and desserts over the next few months, which is something I didn’t think I would be able to do due to my ankle injury. In addition to the more substantial meals, the Everyday Set also makes smaller tasks like making a side of rice and veggies a breeze. Even when I have the time to put something together on the stove, I’ll definitely be using these bowls at the same time. Then, I’ll store my leftovers in them later!Buy: 8-Piece Everyday Set, $125 (normally $160)My Kitchn HelperGet our favorite editor-tested and -approved finds sent twice a week to your inbox.",

Somehow, I’m still shocked every time that the pieces come out crispy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eI decided to go a step further, beyond the basics of scrambled eggs and steamed veggies, and try my hand at Anyday’s \u003ca rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored noreferrer\" data-link-type=\"product\" data-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:6322802337513472\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://atmedia.link/product?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcookanyday.com%2Fproducts%2Fshrimp-scampi\u0026amp;referralSource=%7BREFERRAL_SOURCE%7D\u0026amp;id=23688757\u0026amp;site=KT\u0026amp;refUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thekitchn.com%2Fanyday-everyday-set-review-ll-23688757\" data-gtm-teaser-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:6322802337513472\" data-gtm-teaser-product-name=\"[PLACEHOLDER NAME]\" data-gtm-teaser-product-retailers=\"Anyday\" data-gtm-teaser-product-url=\"https://cookanyday.com/products/shrimp-scampi\" data-gtm-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:6322802337513472\" data-gtm-product-name=\"[PLACEHOLDER NAME]\" data-gtm-product-retailers=\"Anyday\" data-gtm-product-url=\"https://cookanyday.com/products/shrimp-scampi\"\u003eshrimp scampi\u003c/a\u003e. The recipe calls for two minutes of prep and two minutes in the microwave. Since it’s so easy to overcook, I was a bit worried at first, but I should’ve known better. The sauce was tasty and simple, and the shrimp’s consistency wasn’t rubbery in the slightest. What’s helpful is that Anyday’s online instructions allow you to input your microwave’s wattage and desired serving size. Once you do, it tells you which size of dish to use.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor my next dish, I decided to test how well the bowls handled baking. Banana bread is one of my favorite fall recipes, so when I saw that Anyday had \u003ca href=\"https://atmedia.link/product?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcookanyday.com%2Fproducts%2Fbanana-bread\u0026amp;referralSource=%7BREFERRAL_SOURCE%7D\u0026amp;id=23688757\u0026amp;site=KT\u0026amp;refUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thekitchn.com%2Fanyday-everyday-set-review-ll-23688757\" data-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:6345338970439680\" data-link-type=\"product\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" data-gtm-teaser-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:6345338970439680\" data-gtm-teaser-product-name=\"[PLACEHOLDER NAME]\" data-gtm-teaser-product-retailers=\"Anyday\" data-gtm-teaser-product-url=\"https://cookanyday.com/products/banana-bread\" data-gtm-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:6345338970439680\" data-gtm-product-name=\"[PLACEHOLDER NAME]\" data-gtm-product-retailers=\"Anyday\" data-gtm-product-url=\"https://cookanyday.com/products/banana-bread\"\u003ea recipe\u003c/a\u003e, I hurried to get all the ingredients together. Understandably, prep is a bit more laborious for something like this, requiring a separate mixing bowl and eight minutes of putting it all together. The biggest difference is in the baking time. Rather than taking an hour in the oven, 10 minutes in the microwave produced moist banana bread almost on par with others I’ve made the regular way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"base-html\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eI can’t wait to make more cozy fall meals and desserts over the next few months, which is something I didn’t think I would be able to do due to my ankle injury. In addition to the more substantial meals, the Everyday Set also makes smaller tasks like making a side of rice and veggies a breeze. Even when I have the time to put something together on the stove, I’ll definitely be using these bowls at the same time. Then, I’ll store my leftovers in them later!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuy: \u003ca rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored noreferrer\" data-link-type=\"product\" data-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:5850220530237440\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://atmedia.link/product?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcookanyday.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-everyday-set\u0026amp;referralSource=%7BREFERRAL_SOURCE%7D\u0026amp;id=23688757\u0026amp;site=KT\u0026amp;refUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thekitchn.com%2Fanyday-everyday-set-review-ll-23688757\" data-gtm-teaser-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:5850220530237440\" data-gtm-teaser-product-name=\"The Everyday Set\" data-gtm-teaser-product-price=\"160.00\" data-gtm-teaser-product-retailers=\"Anyday\" data-gtm-teaser-product-tags=\"small-appliances-microwave,cookware-cookware-sets\" data-gtm-teaser-product-url=\"https://cookanyday.com/products/the-everyday-set\" data-gtm-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:5850220530237440\" data-gtm-product-name=\"The Everyday Set\" data-gtm-product-price=\"160.00\" data-gtm-product-retailers=\"Anyday\" data-gtm-product-tags=\"small-appliances-microwave,cookware-cookware-sets\" data-gtm-product-url=\"https://cookanyday.com/products/the-everyday-set\"\u003e8-Piece Everyday Set\u003c/a\u003e, $125 (normally $160)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003csection\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMy Kitchn Helper\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eGet our favorite editor-tested and -approved finds sent twice a week to your inbox.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
