Here Comes the Sun Bread.A joyful baked creation, taken from a children’s book, celebrates the return of longer days.Credit...Linda Xiao for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Yossy Arefi.Updated When my oldest daughter started kindergarten, I signed up to be a classroom parent. The school was small, public and in ethnically diverse Jersey City, which meant my daughter shared crayons with kids whose families came from all over the world. When it came time to plan the holiday party, the principal requested that it celebrate the season, but without any specific religious or cultural overtones. No Santa. No menorahs. Just joy.We could’ve just thrown a “Frozen”-themed bash, and the kids would have been thrilled, but I wanted to do something with a bit more substance. (And frankly, I’d had enough of Anna and Elsa.) I’m embarrassed to admit that it took the internet to remind me of the obvious choice: Winter Solstice, the first day of winter and the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.Known as Saturnalia to the ancient Romans and Dong Zhi to the Chinese, “the return of the sun” has been celebrated by people from all over the world since ancient times. Many modern-day Christmas rituals, like decorating trees and burning yule logs, are derived from Winter Solstice traditions.But I couldn’t walk into a roomful of five-year olds blathering on about primordial solstice rituals. I needed a lighthearted and more engaging way to introduce the idea. Pinterest led me to “Sun Bread” by Elisa Kleven (Puffin Books, 2001), a lushly illustrated children’s book about a plucky but lonely canine baker who finds herself in the midst of a dreary winter and resolves to bake her way out of it.Bare trees shook like chilly bones.Children grumbled in their homes.Birds and beasts all wished the sunWould show its golden face again.The baker makes her “own small sun inside,” a golden loaf in the shape of the sun. The warmth of the baking bread, and the act of sharing it, lures her animal friends out of their homes — and into hers — to celebrate.Bread so brilliant, bright and sunny.Summer seemed to fill their tummies.Bread so fluffy and so fine,They felt themselves begin to shine …The animals’ dancing and joy awakens the real sun:It burst out through the lumpy cloudsAnd streamed down on the startled crowd.“The sun is here!” They gave a cheer.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
