Credit...David Malosh for The New York TimesJan. 29, 2025, 2:16 p.m. ETFour days after my youngest returned to college from winter break, they called, debating whether to come home. Wildfires had broken out across Los Angeles, where we both live, causing unimaginable damage to homes and whole neighborhoods. We knew families who lost everything in an instant and didn’t know what might come as evacuation zones expanded and dry wind took down trees. Of course, I desperately wanted to pick up my kid, but also to let them make that choice. A few minutes after we reviewed our emergency meet-up plan, they called back asking for a ride. The campus was emptying fast.On our way home, we took the 405 freeway, and, at its crest, saw the furious red arc of flames from the Palisades fire. By the time we pulled into our driveway, ash flurried lightly in the darkness. My instinct was to cook my kid something to allay anxiety as the world around us burned. As if reading my mind, they asked for pasta.“With a creamy sauce, but also tomato sauce? Maybe spicy? Something like the Bolognese you used to make.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT",
