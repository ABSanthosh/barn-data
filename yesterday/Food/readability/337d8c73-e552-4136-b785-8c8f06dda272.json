I was walking Graham this morning (sidenote: October is National Adopt a Dog month so if you’re on the fence… you know what to do) and thought back to 2020 when we all classified the times were were living in as UNPRECEDENTED.  Remember that word?  I think we wore it out and yet, my word, it’s still all very very unprecedented, right? It feels like, with all our effort, we’re grinning and bearing it.  It’s both dissonant and mundane. I’ve dubbed myself fully recovered from the surgery I had a few weeks ago and very much relate to Amy’s Taurean feelings of impatience.  Though, to be honest, trash-ass Geminis are impatient in a much more chaotic way. I’ve gone back to the gym and according to my legs – I’ve hit the weights too hard and I’ll be hobbling around for the next few days.  I googled, “I’m so sore I think I hurt myself” hoping for a reddit thread to inspire me to go upstairs and take an epsom salt bath. If you feel a little sore and spinny from this year, too – I’m with you.  Here’s a little this and that from around the internet to go along with your morning coffee, and what I hope is a few moments of ease. As always, take only what you need. •  The news from North Carolina this week has been just unbelievable. Heartbreaking. I’ve donated to World Central Kitchen (which you can see with boots on the ground from one of my favorite Asheville restaurants Curate) and made purchases from both French Broad Chocolates and Kid Seed Co in the hopes that even little bits of support help. (WCK, Instagram) •  Tomorrow marks 365 grim days since the October 7th attack on Israel. I think the story of Vivian Silver and her family is important.  His Mother Was Killed By Hamas. Her Death Transformed His Life (New York Magazine Gift Article) •  There’s one coping mechanism missing from this helpful list of tools to Bounce Back from Failure.  Take a nap. Just go to sleep about it for at least an hour. (Self) •  What’s the national dish of Ireland?  Be for real, is it Kerrygold Butter?  How Irish butter took over the world: A Dream of Gold and Green. (Substack) •  Can confirm that Texas Is A Great Outdoor-Adventure State! There are so many beautiful state parks and you can sneak away far enough to lose the crowds.  Louisiana is also an amazing outdoor state!  It’s almost outside weather down here so be ready! (Outside Magazine) •  Whole Foods Tried to Change This Cake Recipes. Customers Lost It.  Because there’s only so much they can take from us. Not our cake! (NYT Gift Article) •  I love a seasonal house cocktail – something that I can always have at the ready for guests and pop-in.  I’m tempted to make this Cinnamon Tequila Sour the house cocktail for autumn. It would be unexpected, to be sure. Honestly maybe it would deter pop-ins.  (The Kitchn) •  Have you ever made your own laundry detergent? I’m on the brink of making the transition. (Lemons Lavender and Laundry) •  I love an autumn craft that can transform into homemade holiday gifts. I’ve had the idea of easy Honeycomb Candles that can be gifted with thrifted candle holders. Sweet, right? Also, always open to ideas if you have a crafty perspective.  (Amazon) •  To file away in your What To Gift Someone Who Actually Has Everything folder:  Two full pounds of Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese. When someone has everything – the gifting goes off the rails. (Williams Sonoma) •  Have you seen Erica’s Best Pumpkin Muffin Bake Off?  This is the journalism my kitchen needs! I’m proud to say that our cozy pumpkin muffins took second place which… I’ll take! The first place winner used vanilla pudding which, I’m nodding my head yea – it makes baked goods taste like cake mix in the best way. (Pancake Princess, Joy the Baker) •  Speaking of pumpkin, wouldn’t these layered scones be great with pumpkin pie filling? I’m going to try a batch next week along with this idea for Apple Fritter Focaccia I can’t get out of my head. (King Arthur Baking) •  Our friend Timothy made this very cozy Chicken and Yellow Rice which I would eat for at least four nights straight.  He uses this Easy Baked Rice method which I’ve adopted to make the most delicious buttery herb rice on the regular. (Mississippi Vegan) •  Do you know what we’re doing about book shelves? I have stacks and stacks of cookbooks I desperately need to get off my living room floor for my own sanity and it seems like floating type shelves are either cheapy stuff from IKEA (said without judgement) or absurdly expensive, questionable quality shelves. Are they all just the same stuff? If you have any thoughts, please advise. (West Elm) Have a lovely, Sunday friends. My love to you. xo Joy Reader Interactions RELATED POSTS IN Let It Be Sunday!",
