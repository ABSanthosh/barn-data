Girl scout cookies ranked. I actually agree with this. 5. TV things!! I started watching The Pitt because it’s set here in Pittsburgh! I also watched The Substance because apparently I LOST MY MIND. I don’t think I’ve watched a horror movie since seventh grade. But yes, the women were great. I really need to watch The Traitors too. 6. Also, Ali Larter’s accessories in Landman make me want to adopt the mob wife trend. I need a big leopard tote. It is my favorite color after all. 7. Currently reading The Favorites and LOVING IT. What are you reading? 8. A vertical waffle maker is my newest kitchen obsession. It’s fabulous. Pouring the batter in on top is a game changer. 9. Also! I’m addicted to the trader joe’s aglio olio seasoning blend. It is SO GOOD on everything. 10. Historical inauguration photos. I loved looking at these.",
