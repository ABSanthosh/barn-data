  "text": "Friends, hello – how are we? Cold? Exactly. It’s not that I’m here to wish away February but I just can’t seem to get warm this week.  Here is a short list of things I’m looking forward to in March because that’s where I want to be, mentally – The sun setting at a reasonable hour so I no longer feel like I should be in pajamas by 5:30 PM. Grocery store tulips—specifically Trader Joe’s tulips that I’ll mix with their chamomile flowers. A good excuse to make corned beef and cabbage and pretend I know what I’m doing. The first warm day that tricks me into wearing sandals (or at least shoes without socks?), immediately followed by regret. King Cake season winding down, but not before I squeeze in one more slice. An early spring but still very cozy dinner party – I decided that if  I want to go to more parties, I need to start thowing them myself. There has been some news this week that has absolutely wrecked me, but we’re blessed with this Sunday together to recalibrate.  Here’s a list of links that are keeping me warm, mentally and spiritually – and now I’m off to see how many sweatshirts I can layer onto my body. •  Let’s kick things off with my favorite read of the week: 16 Things Our Mom Told Us That Turned Out To Be So, So True. When I was little, my mom would send us off to school or Girl Scouts with a simple but solid reminder: “Be the best of you that you can be.” And if I ever got worked up over life not being fair? Patty would hit me with a straight-faced “Who said life was fair?” …and honestly, she had a point. No one. Ever. Grateful to have learned those lessons early. (Substack) •  There’s always something new and beautiful to learn about New Orleans: The Black Composers of New Orleans Opera are Finally Getting Their Due (Atlas Obscura) •  I did not expect to have tears well up over a rare deep sea angler fish seen for the first time in daylight, but then this song came across my desk and destroyed me.   (Oceanographic Magazine, TikTok) •  Why we can’t stand feeling bored. Honestly, I’m having a hard time believing that boredom even exists anymore. I haven’t been bored since 1998. Wait… is that the problem? (The Guardian) •  Have you heard of “lemonading” aka looking at the dang bright side? It’s more that just delusional positivity because honestly, that’s just creepy these days.  Once you give this a read, please let me know your go-mantra.  Mine is a Mel Robbins style countdown:  5,4,3,2,1 and GO.  Weirdly, it works every time.  (Self, YouTube) •  Making a case for store-bought croissants because this Chocolate Croissant Overnight Breakfast Bake is absolutely more than the sum of its parts.  I now keep HEB croissants in the freezer.  (Joy the Baker) •  I am thiiiiiis close to buying a Ninja Creami.  Do you have one? Have you ever heard of one? Are we all whipping up our own on-demand ice cream this spring and summer?  (Amazon) •  Here’s What You Can Learn From An 8-Year-Old Who Climbs Way Harder Than You, and my hats off to this entire adventure family.   (Outside Magazine) •  Every dog person I have in my life will be receiving one of these  Tell Your Dog I Said Hi totes for any upcoming birthday or random accomplishment.  A cotton zipper tote that also saves dogs? Say less.  (We Rate Dogs) •  Amy mentions how she’s “solar powered” and after just a week of late-winter grey and freezing temperatures in Texas I am in full agreement.  It’s just that Texas gave of a taste of spring the last two weeks and then snatched it away for temps in the 20’s that feel like the single digits. I did not consent.  But I did splurge on a very colorful spring craft to gift all my girlfriends when we all once again emerge in sundresses: custom bag charm kit from Bauble Bar.  Seriously, how cute, right!? (Bauble Bar) •  Raise your hand if Words of Affirmation are your love language. Ok, now that all of our hands are raised, here’s 14 Things To Say Besides “I Love You”.  (Time) •  Speaking of love languages, we need to add a sixth: Meatballs.  From my saved recipe folder on Instagram: Ricotta Meatball Skillet Bake.  (Instagram) •  I do not carry the gene that makes me good at making playlists. I can set a table beautifully. I can load a dishwasher immaculately. I cannot make a cohesive playlist. There is an essence to that skill that inherently alludes me.  I did, however, settle on my favorite playlist creator: The Weisest Band.  She makes playlists based on color (currently listening to Lavender), astrology (the Gemini playlist is wild), mood (put on Light to sleep), and nearly every song is new to me and so well fashioned. •  Quick question: does the process know…? (Instagram) My love to you, friends! xo Joy 12 Responses Ah, Joy, your musings on the elusive deep-sea anglerfish resonate profoundly. Life’s most enigmatic creatures often dwell in the depths, unseen yet captivating. Your reflections remind me that even in darkness, there is beauty waiting to be discovered. As I navigate the shadows, it’s these unexpected illuminations that offer solace. Thank you for shedding light on the mysteries beneath; it’s a reminder that wonder persists in the most unanticipated places. I really like the lemonading article and the proposal that you aren’t losing sight of what is tough, but you are finding ways to still feel good sometimes. I don’t think that we can maintain the energy to do something about hard things, if we are depressed and angry all of the time. We must find ways to feel sane in the face of our difficult times, in order to help change those difficult things. I don’t know what my mantra is, but I’m going to try and find it. I hope that it is a little warmer for you now. We had a very cold week last week, but we have a few warm days now and I am enjoying them. I’m noticing that the bird sounds are different too. They are spring bird sounds! Sending warm and comforting hugs ??? for whatever made you sad this week… After a week of below 0 and single digits we are in “false spring” here in Wisco. These are the days when the snow is melting so I walk to the mailbox barefoot and in a sweatshirt and don’t bother bringing a hat to walk my dog because it’s above 40. :) Joy, I can hardly wait to make this Chocolate Croissant brekky! Going to make and take to my niece after she delivers her last baby boy next week! That will make 3 boys! Yummmmooooo! Joy this was exactly what I needed today. Thank you! I think all my friends will be getting dog totes too!!! Sorry about the bad news. Sending good energy and prayers your way. Laurie You have outdone yourself this week, Joy. I think my soul is living next door to yours. So many of these links and the way you offer them so tenderly hit hard. SO thankful for your voice. I am all for looking for beauty and joy in every day, but I honestly want to scream at “friends” who post things that seem to imply that we can ignore everything that’s going on in this country and just decide to be happy. Thanks for being real and acknowledging the gravity of the news. Do you remember the kids album where that phrase “Be the best of you that you can be” came from? Lord have mercy the flashback I just had, Sis ?????? Hi Joy, I do have a Ninja Cremi and I can’t say I use it a lot. I bought it because I saw some posts about making high protein ice cream. Which, of course, I thought a good excuse to eat ice cream. I also am dairy free and read labels of everything. All of the dairy free Ice Cream I can purchase here has lots of gums and fillers so making my own would be ideal. But…the consistency is not there. I don’t know if it is me and the ingredients I am using-not enough fat, etc., but it comes out powdery and it needs to remixed. It also needs to be remixed if you don’t eat the entire container in once sitting. I’d love it if someone can share their experience. And, I am sorry for your weather. I am looking forward to March or anything else that will bring sunshine and warmth to melt the piles of snow that we have in Ontario. Love you and love your posts! I am very sorry about your news. I know this is inadequate, and I am just an internet stranger, but I will be thinking of you this week. Leave a Reply This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

We must find ways to feel sane in the face of our difficult times, in order to help change those difficult things.\u003cbr/\u003e\nI don’t know what my mantra is, but I’m going to try and find it.\u003cbr/\u003e\nI hope that it is a little warmer for you now.

I bought it because I saw some posts about making high protein ice cream. Which, of course, I thought a good excuse to eat ice cream.  I also am dairy free and read labels of everything.  All of the dairy free Ice Cream I can purchase here has lots of gums and fillers so making my own would be ideal.  But…the consistency is not there.  I don’t know if it is me and the ingredients I am using-not enough fat, etc., but it comes out powdery and it needs to remixed.  It also needs to be remixed if you don’t eat the entire container in once sitting.  I’d love it if someone can share their experience.\u003cbr/\u003e\nAnd, I am sorry for your weather.
