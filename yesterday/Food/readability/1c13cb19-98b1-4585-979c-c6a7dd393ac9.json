This recipe is written for water-bath canning methods for shelf-stable storage, however it can also be stored in the fridge for up to 2 weeks or in the freezer for up to 6 months! Another year, another strawberry season, another day dragging my husband outside to pick berries. He’s a good sport about it though, and, despite the fact the actual picking is not his favorite activity, he certainly appreciates the fruits of our labors (literally). This year’s strawberry jam (in addition to making a batch of my favorite classic strawberry jam for year-round PB\u0026Js) brings together two fruits that I love individually—strawberry and passionfruit—and love even more together. Case in point: last year’s strawberry passionfruit lemonade which was what inspired this lively flavor combination to begin with. Unique combo fruit jams are… well, my jam. From mango raspberry to strawberry guava, I say why use one fruit when two would be better (or hey, what about three! Or four! In fact, there’s a fabulous triple berry jam, and a ridiculously named FROG jam—fig, raspberry, orange, and ginger—in my book, and they are definitely some of my favorites). When it comes to kinds of fruit, the more the merrier I say! In the case of this recipe, the two fruits compliment each other so beautifully. I love how the tangy passionfruit lifts and enhances the natural flavor of the strawberry, creating a jam that’s brighter and bolder than just plain strawberry jam could ever hope to be. This bright ruby red jam is as bold as it is flavorful, strawberry forward, with a hint of passionfruit where normally there’d be a little lemon for acid and brightness. It’s definitely a strawberry jam with some passionfruit, rather than a passionfruit jam with a little strawberry in it; the primary named ingredient being the dominant flavor. So even though you might think it’s a normal, unassuming strawberry jam at first bite, you’ll soon recognize that there is something extra happening there. That’s the passionfruit’s doing, and what makes this jam so delightfully different. Want More Jam Recipes? Check out my new cookbook, That’s My Jam, with 52+ seasonal recipes for jams, jellies, marmalades \u0026 more! This recipe was written using Ball Classic Pectin, which, during last year’s comparison testing of different brands of pectin, turned out to be our favorite batch, with a balanced sweetness, bright fruit flavor, higher yield and surprisingly fast cook time (pectin-added jams require less than 15 minutes of cook time compared to 45 or more for old-fashioned jams). I’ve been finding myself leaning towards jams with more sugar lately, mainly because of the lovely jammy mouthfeel, gorgeous crystalline appearance, as well as the increased longevity (low-sugar jams tend to lose their color after only a few months; while they’re still fine to eat for up to a year they’re just not as appetizing to me). Not a canner? Not a problem! This jam can be refrigerated in an airtight container for 2 weeks, or even frozen for up to 6 months (keep refrigerated and use within 2 weeks of thawing). This batch uses the “lower” quantity of sugar required for the jam to set (the pectin insert specifies two different quantities), but it could be increased to the higher proprotion if you want an even jammier texture and a higher yield. Just don’t decrease the sugar quantity or you’re setting yourself up for failure (well, not complete failure, just a lovely strawberry passionfruit sauce rather than a jam). If you’re using SureJell original pectin (or another brand of classic pectin), you’ll need to use a much larger quantity of sugar (usually a 1:1 ratio of sugar to fruit by weight) to get it to set properly (unfortunately this brand of pectin is not as flexible as the Ball stuff, don’t say I didn’t warn you). Use the proportions as listed in the recipe that comes with your pectin to ensure a proper set. To adapt this recipe using Pomona’s low-sugar pectin, follow the low-sugar strawberry jam recipe here, replacing the 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of the mashed strawberry with passionfruit pulp instead. While you could technically make an old-fashioned jam using similar instructions (replacing lemon juice with passionfruit pulp instead) I think the heavier, candied fruit flavor that old-fashioned jams have would overpower the delicate brightness of the passionfruit. Find your passion(fruit). Since fresh passion fruits are hard to come by in my neck of the woods, I buy packs of frozen passion fruit pulp, which I then strain to remove the seeds. I love that it is 100% fresh passionfruit, with no preservatives or sweeteners added, so it’s just as good as fresh fruit. If you are using fresh passionfruit (I’m envious you can find it where you are!) you’ll need about 8 juicy fruits to yield the 6 tablespoons called for here. Passionfruit pulp can sometimes ‘cling’ to the seeds making it hard to strain. Briefly pulse it in a food processor or blender on low (don’t pulverize the seeds!) to help release the pulp from the seeds and maximize the yield. If you can only find passionfruit juice or nectar, it will work in a pinch, however if it has added sugar it will make for a sweeter and less acidic final product. If you are using sweetened passionfruit juice, add a tablespoon of lemon juice to ensure proper acidity for canning (not a concern if you’re just refrigerating or freezing it). Monster mash. For best results, strawberries should be coarsely chopped and then mashed. You should obviously use the best berries you can find; I like to use about 75% perfectly ripe berries and 25% slightly less than ripe berries; the latter of which has a bit more natural pectin and will make for a slightly firmer set. Using all underripe berries would result in a much firmer, and less flavorful final product. Sometimes I’ll cheat and pulse the fruit a few times in a food processor instead of chopping, and while the results are fine, you’ll likely end up with fruit float in your canned jars (where the solid chunks of fruit float to the top). This is why mashing is the ideal way to prepare fruit for jam, reducing the likelihood of fruit float. If you prefer a smoother texture, you can also run the fruit through a food mill (the medium or coarse screens). You don’t want to liquify the fruit in a blender or food processor, but a food mill will give you a saucier, smoother texture that’s not as chunky as chopped and mashed fruit. If you do this, just know the jam will be a little looser as a result. Since raspberries have similar levels of pectin and acidity, you can subsitute all or some of the strawberries in this recipe with raspberries instead (and I think raspberry passionfruit would be a lovely combo, as I’ve already proved with this raspberry passionfruit semifreddo recipe from last year). Strawberry Passionfruit Jam Cook Time: 20 minutes Total Time: 1 hour Bright, tangy, and strawberry-forward, this strawberry passionfruit jam is a multi-fruit mashup you'll adore! This recipe is written for water-bath canning methods, but it can also be refrigerated or frozen. ▢ 20 ounces / 560 g strawberries, hulled and coarsely chopped▢ 6 tablespoons / 95 g strained passionfruit pulp▢ 3 tablespoons / 25 g Ball Classic Pectin*▢ ⅛ teaspoon butter, optional▢ 1 ¾ cups / 340 g granulated sugar Fill a large stock pot or canning pot 2/3 full with water; place a rack of some sort in the bottom and place over medium-high heat. Wash/sterilize your jars and submerge in water bath as it heats. The pot should be just about boiling by the time the jam is ready to go. Keep jars in hot (not boiling) water until ready to use. This recipe can also be stored in the fridge or freezer if you don't want to deal with canning it.Mash chopped strawberries with a potato masher, measure out 2 cups of mashed berries.Pour mashed strawberries into a large, heavy saucepan, along with passionfruit juice and pectin. Add butter if desired to reduce foam, you can also skim off any excess foam from the edges of the pan. Bring to a full rolling boil, stirring occasionally, then whisk in sugar, stirring continuously until sugar is completely dissolved and mixture returns to a full rolling boil. Boil hard for exactly 1 minute, then remove from heat.Ladle jam into hot jars, leaving 1/4-inch of head space. Wipe jar rims and screw on lids. Process in boiling water for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Check seals. Any unsealed jars should be refrigerated and used within 3 weeks. This recipe was written for Ball Classic Pectin. If using a different brand or type of pectin, please follow the basic strawberry jam recipe and instructions inside your pectin package (use about 1/4 cup less strawberry than called for, and replace lemon juice with passionfruit juice). Pay attention to the order in which the ingredients are added and the proportion of fruit to sweetener recommended to ensure a proper set. All images and text © for Love \u0026 Olive Oil.

You should obviously use the best berries you can find; I like to use about 75% perfectly ripe berries and 25% slightly less than ripe berries; the latter of which has a bit more natural pectin and will make for a slightly firmer set. Using all underripe berries would result in a much firmer, and less flavorful final product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I’ll cheat and pulse the fruit a few times in a food processor instead of chopping, and while the results are fine, you’ll likely end up with fruit float in your canned jars (where the solid chunks of fruit float to the top). This is why mashing is the ideal way to prepare fruit for jam, reducing the likelihood of fruit float.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you prefer a smoother texture, you can also run the fruit through a food mill (the medium or coarse screens). You don’t want to liquify the fruit in a blender or food processor, but a food mill will give you a saucier, smoother texture that’s not as chunky as chopped and mashed fruit. If you do this, just know the jam will be a little looser as a result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince raspberries have similar levels of pectin and acidity, you can subsitute all or some of the strawberries in this recipe with raspberries instead (and I think raspberry passionfruit would be a lovely combo, as I’ve already proved with \u003ca href=\"https://www.loveandoliveoil.com/2024/03/raspberry-passionfruit-semifreddo-with-chocolate-crumbs.html\" title=\"\"\u003ethis raspberry passionfruit semifreddo recipe\u003c/a\u003e from last year).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"wprm-recipe-container-71997\" data-recipe-id=\"71997\" data-servings=\"24\"\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003ch2\u003eStrawberry Passionfruit Jam\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCook Time: \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e20\u003cspan\u003e minutes\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTotal Time: \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e1\u003cspan\u003e hour\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n  \n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBright, tangy, and strawberry-forward, this strawberry passionfruit jam is a multi-fruit mashup you\u0026#39;ll adore!
