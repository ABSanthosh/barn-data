  "description": "This Chocolate Croissant Overnight Breakfast Casserole is the make-ahead magic your weekend brunch needs—flaky, buttery croissants soaked in a rich custard with melty pockets of chocolate in every bite.  It couldn’t be easier which is absolutely key for winter weekend baking! I suspect we don’t give grocery store croissants enough credit. Sure, they’re more soft than shattery, definitely more pillowy than crisp, but that just makes them perfectly toastable and downright re-workable, right?

This is very much a follow-your-heart recipe. Details to follow.Lightly butter a 10-inch cast iron skillet (or whatever pan you have handy) and set it aside. Take those grocery store croissants—split them in half and tuck them into the pan in a way that feels right to you. No need for perfection here. Scatter most of the mini chocolate chips between the layers, saving a small handful for a last-minute sprinkle before baking. In a bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, and cream until smooth, then add in the maple syrup, vanilla, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. (The cinnamon will clump. That’s just life.) Pour the custard over the croissants, pressing everything down gently so it soaks up all the goodness. Cover and refrigerate overnight—this is where the magic happens. In the morning, preheat the oven to 350°F, top with the remaining chocolate chips, and bake until golden and crisp, about 45-50 minutes. Let it cool slightly before serving warm with soft whipped cream and a drizzle of maple syrup. Then, sit back and enjoy your slow and simple morning, croissant casserole in hand.",
