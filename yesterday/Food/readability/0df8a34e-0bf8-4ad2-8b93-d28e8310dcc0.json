Prior to ATM, I helped launch and manage commerce initiatives for People and InStyle. published yesterdayThe Kitchn received compensation for this post, which was written and edited independently by our editorial team.Credit: Photo: Alex Lepe; Prop Styling: Tom HoerupI love coffee, and I’m always experimenting with different methods of making it. I own a French press, a pod machine, a vintage percolator, a cold brew maker, a do-it-all espresso/coffee machine, too many moka pots, and a Neopolitan cuccumella.I’ve tested lots of coffee makers at different price points — often to mixed results. So when Melitta offered me the opportunity to test their beautiful Vision 12-Cup Luxe Drip Coffee Maker, I was initially on the fence. I thought, sure, it’s stunning, but will the actual coffee actually wow me as much as the machine’s appearance? I decided to give it a shot, and let me tell you: This pretty machine has much more to it than just looks.What Is the Melitta Vision 12-Cup Luxe Drip Coffee Maker?The seriously sleek and stylish Melitta Vision 12-Cup Luxe Drip Coffee Maker features a glass water tank on one side, and a coffee basket and glass carafe on the other. It also has dual heating units and a base that can swivel 180 degrees to fit into the tightest spaces on your counter. To make coffee, fill the tank with water (it has 4-, 6-, and 8-cup markers), add a paper filter to the basket, and scoop in ground coffee. On the dashboard, choose whether you want a regular or bold brew (the button looks like a coffee bean), and hit the start button (which looks like a hot cup of coffee). Now the magic happens: A flame-like “lamp” in the tank lights up and bubbles as the water boils and makes its way up and across to the basket. In a matter of minutes, you have freshly brewed coffee that stays warm as long as the carafe stays on its base. The dashboard also lets you program your brewing time, so you can set it at night and wake up to hot coffee in the morning. Melitta’s machine comes in black or white — each with different accents. The black model has a brown wood bridge connecting the basket and the tank, while the white model has a pale gray bridge, plus copper trim on the tank and basket. Both versions come with a mini coffee scoop and four paper filters to get you started. Why I Love the Melitta Vision 12-Cup Luxe Drip Coffee MakerFor starters, this machine is really easy to use. It doesn’t come with so many bells and whistles that I need to keep referring to the instruction manual to figure out how to make a simple cup of coffee. And the fact that it didn’t ask me to download an app, which seems to be required of every appliance these days, felt like another win.I also have to say it makes a fantastic cup of coffee! I used the same brand of coffee in the Melitta that I’ve used with fancier machines, and I could actually taste a difference. Melitta’s “bold” brew was much better. It was darker, richer, and more robust than the “bold” version made in a more expensive machine. But I must admit that what I love most about the Melitta is the design. Watching that orange tube light up and bubble while the coffee brews is so entertaining! I don’t have a lot of counter space in my tiny kitchen, so being able to adjust the base to make the machine more compact is a huge plus.I own the white/copper model of the coffee maker, and it’s so gorgeous that it looks like a work of art on display in my kitchen. It’s also gotten me so many compliments when my friends see it, which is just one more perk to what I’d say is an already perfect machine.",
