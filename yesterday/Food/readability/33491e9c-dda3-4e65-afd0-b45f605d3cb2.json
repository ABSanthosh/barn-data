  "description": "I LOVE LISTS If you want to take photos of fireworks. Have you been to a drone show? I haven’t. How to make deadheading flowers easier. Flowers that shouldn’t be deadheaded. There are so many ways to eat a hot dog! Let’s look at old things and feel old. Now let’s look at old photos of people taking baths. Old TVs turned into cat beds. The most expensive music video of all time. This Frank Lloyd Wright house in Mississippi is incredible. American food traditions that started as marketing ploys. Taco Bell items employees say to skip. Have you watched the first YouTube video? Behind-the-scenes photos of Rosemary’s Baby. Why are gas stations so close to each other? This must be so cool to see in person. Daydream of living in a farmhouse in upstate New York. Linen: shirt / tunic / pants I would like to put baked beans on my cooking bucket list.
