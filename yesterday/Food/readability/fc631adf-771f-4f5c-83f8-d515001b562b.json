From tiramisu pancakes to the viral tiramisu brownies, it's clear the iconic flavors are having a major moment. And according to Google Trends, searches for “tiramisu cake” have skyrocketed by more than 500% in the past year alone. And we get it. It somehow manages to win over even the non-coffee or cake lovers, which is a feat in itself. Plus, it’s a creamy, indulgent, no-bake Italian dessert that will impress every time. The best part? You can make it ahead, stash it in the fridge, and it only gets better the next day. Plus, you don’t need advanced cake decorating skills (or any baking expertise, really) because a simple dusting of cocoa does the trick every time. It’s the kind of dessert that doesn’t even need a recipe. We’ve also found that tiramisu is endlessly customizable and works its magic in just about everything, from ice cream to cheesecake, and even toast (which, yes, we agree, is an amazing discovery). At our December cookbook club, we were lucky enough to try Renato Poliafito’s Malted Milk Tiramisu from his dessert book Dolci! and immediately fell for the malted twist. In that spirit, we’ve rounded up 22 more recipes that capture the iconic tiramisu flavor and add a little something extra. 1. Classic Tiramisu We had to start with our classic. It’s got all the things that make this Italian dessert a favorite: rich, velvety layers and just the right kick of coffee and cocoa. Whether you’re celebrating or simply treating yourself, it’s the perfect treat for any occasion. 2. Tiramisu Baked Alaska Two iconic desserts in one? Yes, please. Take your tiramisu to the next level with this baked Alaska version. The combination of warm, toasted meringue and cool, creamy layers beneath will have everyone asking for the recipe. 3. Pumpkin Tiramisu This pumpkin tiramisu gives a pumpkin spice latte a run for its money. With brown sugar, bourbon, and a blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, it captures all the fall vibes in a single bite. 4. Milk Tea Tiramisu This Hong Kong-style milk tea tiramisu is perfect for anyone who prefers tea over coffee. With black tea-infused layers and fresh bittersweet chocolate shavings on top, it’s a new take that’s also an instant classic. 5. Gluten-Free Tiramisu This recipe proves that you don’t need gluten to enjoy a tiramisu (it slightly changes the lady fingers, but not by much). This version keeps the same rich flavors but makes it a great option for everyone at the table. 6. Tiramisu Toast We were thrilled to discover that tiramisu toast is a real thing. It’s a quick and easy way to enjoy the classic flavors on the days when making a cake feels like too much. 7. Chocolate Tiramisu Cake If you’ve been searching for more of a cake component to your tiramisu, this recipe is the answer. It takes the beloved dessert into a new, fudgy territory. With rich layers of dark cocoa and coffee, it’s a chocolate-lover’s dream. 8. Maman’s Cookie Tiramisu Why not throw in some chocolate cookies to the mix? These individual servings allow you to scale accordingly or enjoy your own cup at any time (once again, without having to make an entire cake). 9. Fig Cardamom Spiced Tiramisu This tiramisu leans on dried figs and cardamom for a slightly savory twist that nicely balances its sweetness. Topped with dark chocolate shavings, it’s lighter yet more flavorful than most, and even better after a night in the fridge. 10. Tiramisu al Caffe This tiramisu takes inspiration from the warm, aromatic notes of Moroccan coffee and blends it with the traditional Italian flavors. Ladyfingers are infused with spiced coffee, made by mixing Moroccan spices into the grounds, then layered with mascarpone and a splash of spiced rum. 11. Tiramisu Ice Cream Popsicles Turn your morning latte into ice cream with these tiramisu-inspired popsicles. Coffee ice cream and vanilla mascarpone cream come together, then get drizzled with dark chocolate and a sprinkle of crushed lady fingers. 12. Tahini Tiramisu Don’t shy away from tahini in tiramisu. Its nuttiness enhances the coffee and cocoa in the best way, creating a dessert that’s just as decadent as the original, but with a subtle unexpected twist. 13. Irish Coffee Tiramisu This version of tiramisu swaps the traditional rum or brandy for Irish whiskey, adding a whole new depth. It’s built right in the coffee mugs, making it perfect for a dinner party or even a last-minute dessert. With layers of coffee-and Frangelico-soaked ladyfingers topped with whiskey cream, this one’s bound to be a hit. 14. Date \u0026 Cashew Tiramisu This plant-based version of tiramisu still retains that rich, velvety texture we love, with oat-based biscuits and creamy cashew filling. The addition of coconut milk brings a smooth touch, offering a lighter yet equally satisfying take. 15. Strawberry Tiramisu Perfect for summer, this twist on tiramisu swaps the traditional coffee for a sweeter strawberry flavor. You can easily switch up the berries or use a mix to create your own variation. Simply soak ladyfingers in a strawberry jam reduction and layer with a whipped vanilla bean mascarpone and, of course, extra strawberries. 16. London Fog Tiramisu This version of tiramisu transforms a coffee shop classic into fragrant, tea-infused dessert. Achieve that signature London fog flavor by using a mix of dried and extracted lavender, and infusing the ladyfingers with earl grey tea. 17. Tiramisu Cheesecake Can’t choose between cheesecake and tiramisu? Now you don’t have to. This dessert brings together the best of both worlds with a rich, coffee-laced cheesecake layered with a silky tiramisu filling. 18. 31 Layer Tiramisu Crepe Cake There’s 31 reasons to love this take on tiramisu. While it requires a bit more technique than your average version, the result is an impressive crepe cake stacked with layers of espresso-soaked goodness. 19. Limoncello Raspberry Tiramisu Featuring layers of raspberries and lemony mascarpone, it’s a lighter take on the classic dessert that’s perfect for warmer days (or when you're dreaming of them). With the help of store-bought lemon curd, this tiramisu comes together quickly with little mixing required. 20. Tiramisu Cupcakes We had to include a cupcake version of this dessert, and this one just so happens to recommend topping with an espresso macaron—something we’re definitely not going to say no to. 21. Individual Tiramisus We’ve included an Irish whiskey option, but for another extra-sweet nightcap, try swapping in Irish cream like in this individual tiramisu recipe. We definitely trust Jordan Rondel, the creative behind The Caker, to deliver an exceptional version. 22. Tiramisu Ice Cream Cake Similar to the baked Alaska one, but with a lot less effort. Layer some no-churn tiramisu ice cream with whipped mascarpone and coffee-soaked lady fingers and let the freezer do the rest of the work. What’s your ideal tiramisu recipe?
