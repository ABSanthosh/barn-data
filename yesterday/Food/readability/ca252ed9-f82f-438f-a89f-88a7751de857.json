  "description": "I LOVE LISTS Some things you can do with your leaf blower. What is an egg flight? I’ve been craving stuffed peppers. Oh wow. You can look at abandoned blogs. Photographer visits underground bunker. Can anything become a museum? I would live in a dress like this all summer. David Lynch’s belongings are up for auction. New items coming to TJS. Why does Costco open so late? This must be incredible in person. What’s your unusual collection? Behind-the-scenes photos of the movie Gremlins. What’s the healthiest/unhealthiest Chinese food to pick? I would love to live in a home like this. This home is such a different vibe. Owls in towels. This Japanese technique to relocate trees! This pesto and grilled bread, please. Weekend reading: The Joy Reset If you need a boost to get re-motivated for 2025, join me next month for a Half-Year Reset Workshop. Here’s your chance to pause, reflect, and realign your routines so the rest of 2025 feels more intentional and energized. Half-Year Reset Workshop!
