EVERYTHING below is something I use and love (or have used and loved) – these are all my personal recommendations. I ramble about them too much. They probably come as no surprise considering I’ve talked about almost everything before, but here we are! I’d love to hear what you love so I can build out my wishlist! As a note: I like to get the big items like dyson hair tools at this sale. Also, good skincare, value size shampoo and sunscreen. I also love to buy perfume during the sale, because you can rarely find that on sale (if ever!) – especially Tom Ford, Jo Malone, Killian, etc. None of this is sponsored, I just loooove talking beauty products with you. 2025 Sephora Spring Sale My Skincare Essentials. Augustinus Bader The Rich Cream. This will always be a repurchase for me. I use it as eye cream, as face cream – it’s incredible. Totally worth it for me. Elemis Dynamic Resurfacing Pads. I am loving this. They are gentle enough for daily use. Supergoop Value Size Sunscreen. I buy one of these every summer. It stays in the garage and we have sunscreen every time we step out. Luna Sleeping Oil.Been a favorite for years! Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen. This is incredible under makeup. Such a great primer. Dermalogica SPF 50 Moisturizer. Also another great facial sunscreen. It’s lighter with no fragrance. Tan Luxe The Butter. Favorite self tanning cream. Herbivore Cloud Milk Body Cream. I use this daily and it smells incredible. Light vanilla-ish. Skin Services Softening Body Lotion. This is a new-to-me lotion and it’s so light and thin, but incredibly moisturizing. I don’t have anything like it! Sol De Janiero Bum Bum Cream. Classic fave. Will wear it forever. Sol de Janiero Bom Dia Body Scrub. This scrub smells so delicious. I love using it and how the shower smells after. Dr. Dennis Gross Daily Peel Pads. I use these a few times a week at night. Swear they work on the texture on my face. Dr Dennis Gross Facial Steamer. One of my favorite beauty purchases ever! Fresh Sugar Advanced Therapy Lip balm. This saves my lips every night. Laneige Lip Glowy Balm. Every flavor of this is wonderful. So soft and moisturizing. Kate McLeod The Dry Brush. I use this before every shower! First Aid Beauty Ingrown Hair Pads. I love using these under my arms, especially in the summer. Touchland Hand Sanitizer. I love these, but Emilia is the one who really loves them! Def a good time to stock up because they are pricey and don’t go on sale. Soft Services Hand Cream. This was a gift but I keep it by my bed and it’s luxurious and great to use right before bed. My Makeup Essentials. Beauty Blender. I am never without a beauty blender for foundation/bb cream/concealer/etc. Iconic London Underglow Blurring Primer. I don’t like primers but LOVE this. It just evens out the skin and smooths it – I use it on its own or mix with a tinter moisturizer or foundation. Iconic London Blurring Skin Tint. Also love this!! I’ve been mixing it with the above. Still light coverage, but very natural and nice. Ilia Super Serum Skin Tint. I still don’t like heavy foundation on my skin, and this is my current fave if I want a little more coverage. I’ve used this for two years and love how much it evens out my skintone. I’d say it’s light to medium coverage. Ciele Serum Foundation. This is another excellent one like above that has great coverage but also sunscreen! Sits really nicely on the skin and does not ball up. bareMinerals Complexion Rescue. If you like really light coverage, this is still my absolute favorite. I’ve used it forever. Haus Labs Concealer. I discovered it this year and it’s my holy grail now. Obsessed. Too Faced Born This Way Concealer. This is what I used for YEARS before the above. Also good on the face and not too drying. Gucci Bronzer. Best bronzer ever. I’m on my third one. Fenty Bronzer. This is slightly lighter and cooler than the gucci and I like it in the winter time for a very light contour. Charlotte Tilbury Setting Powder. I use this over tinted moisturizer or sunscreen. It’s awesome. Iconic London Radiance Complexion Booster. Use this mixed in with all my tinted moisturizers! Iconic London Liquid Highlight. Adore this highlight for mixing with foundation or moisturizer. It’s very liquidy and it’s pretty golden (almost too golden for me!) but it is wonderful for mixing. I use this almost everyday. Westman Atelier Contour Stick. My favorite contour stick of all time. I use the shade biscuit. I’m on my second one and it is a great formula. Rare Beauty Liquid Contour. While I do prefer a stick, the cool toned shades of this are INCREDIBLE. And it blends so nicely! Gucci Luminous Matte Blush. This is such a stunning matte blush. Lasts forever. Rare Beauty Luminous Blush. I just got three of these last week and I’m obsessed. It’s a blush and highlighter in one. I LOVE THESE. Patrick Ta Major Headlining Blush. This cream and powder duo has incredible shades AND incredible staying power. Merit Cream Blush. If I want a cream blush, this is what I reach for. YSL Make Me Blush Blush. These colors are also incredible. And this is so pigmented and beautiful. Georgio Armani Luminous Silk Cheek Tint. Another liquid blush that I am loving. Especially in the peach shade. Rare Beauty Silky Touch Highlighter. This is such a gorgeous highlighter and creamy formula. It’a almost always sold out too. If you see it, grab it! Hourglass Unlocked Mascara. I hate buying expensive mascara but omg this is WORTH IT. It’s a tubing mascara and does not flake or smudge, plus gives excellent length. Benefit Gimme Brow. The ONLY thing I use on my brows. It’s so natural. Nothing compares to the tiny brush. Nars Pro Prime Smudgeproof Base. This is my favorite for eyeshadow base. Have used it forever. Makeup by Mario Moistureglow Lip. Obsessed with this. It is SO moisturizing and love the colors. Like a balm with a lot of color! Tarte Maracuja Lip. I adore these, I have so many different versions and colors and I love them all. Another product you don’t need a mirror to apply. Lawless Forget the Filler Gloss. Can you tell I am obsessed with balm and gloss?! I probably have five of these. Lawless Forget the Filler Balm. Equally as good as the above!! Dior Lip Glow Oil. Another classic that I always have with me. my current favorite is the berry shade. Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm. I have one of these stashed everywhere. Fenty Gloss Bomb Stick. Best formula ever – it’s so silky and moisturizing. Fenty Gloss Bomb Ice. If you’re someone who loves a mint lipgloss, this is a fabulous one. Always have one in my car. Sephora Pro Foundation Brush. This is the brush that I use for my westman atelier products. I love how it blends! It’s super soft and I find it to be a great brush for the price. Urban Decay Moondust Eyeshadow. I love these for a single swipe of color. My favorites are space cowboy and rebel star. Makeup By Mario Master Matte Nuetrals Palette. My favorite matte palette. Natasha Denona I Need a Nude Palette. My everyday eye palette! Natasha Denona Glam Palette. I use this when I want a little more drama. On til Dawn Setting Spray. This is essentially hairspray for your face. NOTHING MOVES. My Hair Essentials Crown Affair The Hair Towel. I’ve used hair towels for years but this specific one is THE BEST. It has a strap to tuck the towel in and secure it. Dyson Hair Dryer. Eddie got this for me for Christmas last year. It is life changing. I would only ever buy it if it is on sale, and if you have a lot of hair. It adds so mcu volume and body! Dyson Airstraight. I just got this a few weeks ago and I LOVE it. I feel like it has totally cut out a section of my hair styling time and it’s amazing. Dyson Air Wrap. Another thing I didn’t think I’d ever buy, but last year I did. It is AMAZING! This can definitely be a one stop shop for your hair. If I could only take one hair tool with me to a deserted island, it would be this. It’s so pricey and rarely ever on sale! Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Shampoo. Favorite shampoo ever! Get the value size if you can. Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Conditioner. Same as the above. The scent is so good too. Crown Affair Volumizing Shampoo. I have tried a lot of volume shampoos and this is by far my favorite. The conditioner is good too! Moroccan Oil Root Boost. I love this for some volume when styling. I use on wet hair before drying. Color Wow Dream Coat. This is key in the warmer months for no frizz. Kerastase Hair Oil Serum. I use this once a week on my ends. Living Proof  Restore Perfecting Spray. My favorite leave in condition. Doesn’t weigh down my hair at all. Oribe Dry Texturizing Spray. This is my favorite spray to use on dry hair. Adds texture and volume but isn’t sticky. Sol de Janiero Leave In Conditioner. Again, the best scent. T3 Whirl Trio. I bought this at a VIB sale a few years ago and still use it weekly. It is an amazing high-quality set that took me a long time to buy (so pricey!) but I use it SO much. And I love that it comes with three sizes of the wand. My Fragrance Essentials I am a warm fragrance person. I love all things vanilla, amber, mush, a very very light hint of floral – those are the scents I gravitate towards. These are a few of my all-time faves that I highly recommenced. Fragrance never goes on sale so this is the perfect time to try. I also always try travel sizes first when possible before buying a big bottle. The Maker Dream. This was a new find in 2024 and the scent is fabulous. So warm but not too sweet. Replica Afternoon Delight. Another new find this year, I’ve been wearing it consistently every single day for months. It might be my current #1 right now! Glossier You. This has been one of my favorites for YEARS. It’s delicious. Tom Ford Vanilla Sex. One of my newest perfumes and I adore it. Smells wonderful. Carolina Herrara Good Girl. As a note, I hate this bottle. It kept me from buying it for years. But this is basically the best scent ever. Tom Ford Soleil Blanc. My go to summer scent. A light coconutty but warm fragrance. Tom Ford Lost Cherry Warm and delicious with a hint of red cherry. It’s so good. In Too Deep Perfume. More warm deliciousness. Kilian Paris Love Don’t Be Shy. This is kind of marshmallowy and sweet but also light with light floral. It’s delicious. Jo Malone Mimosa and Cardamom. A longtime favorite of mine. Warm and floraly. [as usual, none of this is sponsored and all of these products were purchased by me. i am not affiliated with any of the companies above, nor do i accept free products. just love to talk about what i like, makeup junkie to makeup junkie. there are some amazon and general reward style affiliate links above. thank you for being here!]",
