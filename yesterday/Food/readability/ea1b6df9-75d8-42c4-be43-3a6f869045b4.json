Popping up on the viral video app in a slew of colors and materials, users are showing off their creative seasonal takes for followers.User @herfragrantoffering transformed a copper Bundt pan two different ways, both of which are easy and can be done using a few key items you might already have on hand. First, they turned the Bundt pan upside down and stuffed the center hole with tissue paper, before inserting fake leaves and a stem to turn it into a makeshift pumpkin. They also flipped the pan and stuffed it with tissue paper, topping it with fall-themed fake grass, pumpkins, and acorns of varying sizes. No mess, no glue, and you’ve got a perfect addition to your fall tablescape.For something a bit more elaborate, TikToker @unicorncraftdesigns purchased a secondhand red Bundt pan and used a hot glue gun to add some floral foam blocks along the inside of it. She then painted a jar lid orange and brown to give it a “rusted-out look,” gluing it to the center hole of the pan. She then inserted a variety of fake flowers that she bought at Dollar Tree around the center of the pan, adding an LED candle in the center for a stunning centerpiece that looks incredibly real. Halloween fans will love the “fun fall DIY ‘Bundtkin’” created by @homesweetfarmhousenc, who began by spray painting a white Bundt pan orange. She took some old wooden candlesticks and sawed them to fit in the center of the pan, staining it to serve as the pumpkin’s stem and using super glue to keep it in place. She then tied a ribbon and showed off her other Bundt-inspired creations, including a red apple and a second “Bundtkin.”Of course, you could easily decorate your Bundt pan for any season or theme, but it feels perfectly timely to create your own autumnal-inspired centerpiece now that fall is finally in full swing.",
