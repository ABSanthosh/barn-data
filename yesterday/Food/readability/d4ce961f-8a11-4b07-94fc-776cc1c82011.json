Whether you like an old-fashioned moka, a traditional drip, or a high-end espresso machine, with the right machine at your disposal, your perfect cup is merely minutes away. However, if you’ve yet to find the right tool for you, let me introduce you to a find I think you just may fall in love with, especially if you like coffee, espresso, and everything in between. Say hello to Ninja’s Espresso \u0026 Coffee Barista System. With just a push of a button, you can have everything from a simple cup to the most delicious cappuccino ready in less time (and money!) than it would cost you to head to your local coffee shop. The best part? You can save 30% on this stellar machine right now during Amazon’s Presidents’ Day sale! So, what exactly are you getting with the Ninja Espresso \u0026 Coffee Barista System? Well, the answer is just about everything. This machine makes your choice of a classic, rich, or over-ice brew (in nine different sizes from cup to carafe) as well as café-style espresso (complete with a silky smooth crema), allowing you to enjoy basic drinks alongside lattes, cappuccinos, flat whites, and more with just one compact machine.As for the type of coffee you’ll need, note that the coffee section of this machine uses ground coffee, while the espresso section requires capsule pods. That being said, the machine is thankfully compatible with most pod varieties (including Nespresso) giving you a range of options. To top it off, you’ll also find a foldaway milk frother, a built-in measuring spoon, an adjustable cup, and a used capsule bin for quick and easy recycling. It’s truly like having your own mini barista!Speaking of which, this machine has found fans in real-life baristas, too! “I worked at a Starbucks for a while and got big into espresso drinks,” shared reviewer Eric Dykstra. “I no longer work there, but wanted to make more espresso drinks. I ordered this setup to brew pot coffee along with espresso. To start, the pot coffee has great taste, runs well, and is easy to clean. No complaints. Espresso, however, exceeded all expectations. It takes pods (kind of like Keurig), and it is just like in the coffee shop. You can choose standard espresso, lungo (longer shot), or over-ice shots. The taste is perfect with the Starbucks pods, and the quality is top-notch.” What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying “This is the only coffee maker you’ll ever need. If you’re someone who relies on that first cup in the morning, this one is easy to program. For those who only need a quick caffeine fix, lucky you—but that’s not us. We often need an espresso pick-me-up once or twice between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. With the right pods, the espresso is great, and the cold frothier on the side works like a charm. I also love the clear carafe on this model—it lets me see from across the room just how dangerously low we’re getting, so I don’t have to walk over and shake it to figure out the situation. Our previous Ninja coffee maker was a workhorse and lasted about five years despite tough conditions and heavy use. If this one lasts half that long, it’ll have been well worth the investment. If it can meet our demands, it should be perfect for you as well.” — Mat J. “This thing is amazing! Want a latte with frothed milk? Done. Want an iced coffee? Doneski! Want an espresso? Nailed it! It’s gonna be one of those days and you want a whole pot? No prob! This is less expensive than its fancier counterpart, but does almost as much. Absolutely worth it!” — SoAtypical “Being a loyal Keurig owner for over a decade, I was very hesitant in switching brands and equipment. Saying how grateful I am would be an understatement!!! This machine rocks in every aspect; coffee, espresso, lattes, milk frothing, etc. Truly a one-stop shop for all your coffee needs. Favorite features are the delayed brew and single cup option. Wife adds a double espresso to her protein shake in the morning and violà! A healthier version of a vanilla iced coffee! If you’re on the fence, trust your instincts and get this machine!!!” — Shawnk Ready to upgrade your at-home coffee bar? This Ninja coffee system usually comes in at $250, but right now during Presidents’ Day weekend, you can save 30% off and pick it up for just $199.95. And with over 3,000 of these machines sold in the last month, I’d say you’re in great company. After all, what’s better than bringing the entire café home? Buy: Ninja Espresso \u0026 Coffee Barista System, $199.95 (normally $249.99)My Kitchn HelperGet our favorite editor-tested and -approved finds sent twice a week to your inbox.",

Saying how grateful I am would be an understatement!!! This machine rocks in every aspect; coffee, espresso, lattes, milk frothing, etc. Truly a one-stop shop for all your coffee needs. Favorite features are the delayed brew and single cup option. Wife adds a double espresso to her protein shake in the morning and violà! A healthier version of a vanilla iced coffee! If you’re on the fence, trust your instincts and get this machine!!!” — \u003ca rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\" data-link-type=\"product\" data-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:6697427236028416\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PPYYCAK2W0TQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?asc_campaign=KT-23710006\u0026amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thekitchn.com%2Fninja-espresso-coffee-barista-system-presidents-day-sale-2025-23710006\u0026amp;asc_source=%7BREFERRAL_SOURCE%7D\u0026amp;tag=kitchn-20\" data-gtm-teaser-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:6697427236028416\" data-gtm-teaser-product-name=\"[PLACEHOLDER NAME]\" data-gtm-teaser-product-retailers=\"Amazon\" data-gtm-teaser-product-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PPYYCAK2W0TQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl\" data-gtm-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:6697427236028416\" data-gtm-product-name=\"[PLACEHOLDER NAME]\" data-gtm-product-retailers=\"Amazon\" data-gtm-product-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PPYYCAK2W0TQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl\" data-gtm-trigger=\"element-visible click\" data-gtm-event-category=\"ecommerce\" data-gtm-ui-component=\"post_product_text_link\"\u003eShawnk\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"Post__item\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eReady to upgrade your at-home coffee bar? \u003ca rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\" data-link-type=\"product\" data-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:6033774618869760\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9YP76FN?asc_campaign=KT-23710006\u0026amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thekitchn.com%2Fninja-espresso-coffee-barista-system-presidents-day-sale-2025-23710006\u0026amp;asc_source=%7BREFERRAL_SOURCE%7D\u0026amp;tag=kitchn-20\" data-gtm-teaser-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:6033774618869760\" data-gtm-teaser-product-name=\"Ninja Espresso \u0026amp; Coffee Barista System\" data-gtm-teaser-product-price=\"249.99\" data-gtm-teaser-product-retailers=\"Amazon\" data-gtm-teaser-product-tags=\"coffee-tea-coffee-maker\" data-gtm-teaser-product-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9YP76FN\" data-gtm-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:6033774618869760\" data-gtm-product-name=\"Ninja Espresso \u0026amp; Coffee Barista System\" data-gtm-product-price=\"249.99\" data-gtm-product-retailers=\"Amazon\" data-gtm-product-tags=\"coffee-tea-coffee-maker\" data-gtm-product-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9YP76FN\" data-gtm-trigger=\"element-visible click\" data-gtm-event-category=\"ecommerce\" data-gtm-ui-component=\"post_product_text_link\"\u003eThis Ninja coffee system\u003c/a\u003e usually comes in at $250, but right now during Presidents’ Day weekend, you can save 30% off and pick it up for just $199.95.
