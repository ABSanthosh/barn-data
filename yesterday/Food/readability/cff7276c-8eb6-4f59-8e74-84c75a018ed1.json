The wines are getting better and better.Carsten Saalwächter, looking over the Rhine, is among a group of young German winemakers focusing on making superb chardonnays.Credit...Stephen Bitterolf/vom BodenFeb. 27, 2025, 5:02 a.m. ETChardonnay is both ubiquitous and despised, neither for good reason.The grape is grown all over the world, more for reasons of commerce than of quality. This has meant a lot of mediocre and bad chardonnay, which has led many wine lovers to dismiss it categorically.That’s a shame, because a lot of great chardonnays are made as well, and from a growing number of places, many of which have never been associated with top-quality chardonnay. Oregon is one example. New Zealand is another.But I want to focus here on chardonnay from Germany. I’ve had some bottles over the last couple of years that have been so good that I’ve become a believer. A recent dinner in New York at which two dozen German chardonnays were poured, possibly the most comprehensive tasting in the United States to date, confirmed this view.The wines were not merely good, they were distinctive, a necessary component when trying to break into a global market with a grape as omnipresent as chardonnay.The best German chardonnays I’ve had walk a tightrope between the freshness and energy that comes from lively acidity and the subtle flavors of ripe, but not overripe, grapes.This balancing act allows for a full range of savory saline and stony mineral flavors, very different from the flamboyant fruitiness and buttery expanse of the reviled California chardonnays of old. I also like the relatively low levels of alcohol, generally around 12 percent.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
