All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Ashia AubourgIn a way, Ina Garten — similar to other legends like Edna Lewis and Julia Child — feels like a grandma to me: a reliable, comforting presence I can always turn to when I’m in the kitchen. Don’t get me wrong, both of my mam’mas can cook, but they’re not pros at everything; sometimes I have to seek wisdom from these culinary matriarchs.With Easter approaching, I’ve been on the hunt for a coconut cake recipe. So when I stumbled on one from the Barefoot Contessa with nearly 600 five-star reviews, I immediately started my grocery list so I could try it out (luckily, I practically had everything on hand!). You see, I know I can always lean on Garten for recipe advice — like a brilliant grandmother, she always comes through.How to Make Ina Garten’s Coconut Layer CakeWhile the oven preheats, prepare the batter. Start by creaming the butter and sugar until  it’s yellow and fluffy. Add the eggs (extra-large, of course), one at a time, mixing in between rounds, then add the vanilla and almond extract. (If the mixture looks a bit curdled, that’s okay; it’s just part of the process!)For the dry ingredients, sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Alternately add the dry ingredients and the milk to the batter in three parts (beginning and ending with dry ingredients). Once combined, stir in the coconut milk, being careful not to overmix. Divide the batter between two (9-inch) round cake pans and bake for 35 to 55 minutes. While the cakes are cooling, make the frosting. Beat together softened cream cheese, butter, vanilla, and almond extract on low speed. Add powdered sugar sugar and continue mixing until it becomes smooth (don’t beat it on a high level unless you want a powder sugar mess everywhere!).To decorate the cake, place one layer on a flat serving plate, top side down, and spread with frosting. Pace the second layer on top, top side up, and frost the top and sides. For more cake frosting tips, check out The Kitchn’s guide here. Finish the cake by sprinkling the top with coconut flakes and lightly pressing more coconut flakes onto the sides.My Honest Review of Ina Garten’s Coconut Layer CakeFrom start to finish, this masterpiece of a coconut cake took under three hours to make. I appreciated some of the gems Garten tucked into this recipe — like adding the eggs one at a time to help with emulsification and sifting the dry ingredients to create a lighter crumb.I tend to get overwhelmed by decorating layer cakes, but this one offers a lot of room for error — here’s why: Both cakes rose pretty evenly, so I didn’t even have to slice off the tops to balance them out. Secondly, once I finished frosting the cake, if there were any naked spots, I could just cover them with coconut flakes.As for the taste, here’s a quick tidbit to show how I know it was delicious: I brought the cake to my mom’s house, and within a few hours, it was gone. My family and I all appreciated the rich and tangy cream cheese frosting, which paired nicely with the sweet cake boasting notes of almonds and coconut. It was tender and airy, making it easy to eat more than one slice at a time. With Easter just a few days away, I’m making a few of these cakes for my spread — because I know if I don’t, I won’t hear the end of it from my relatives. It’s that good.Tips for Making Ina Garten’s Coconut Layer Cake Swap the milk. Swap the whole milk for coconut milk to give this cake an even sweeter and nuttier flavor. Make an exciting filling. Instead of stuffing this cake with cream cheese frosting, make a homemade lemon, passionfruit, or raspberry curd to give it a fruity and bright pop of flavor.   Toast the coconut. Garnish your cake with toasted coconut to add a subtly smoky, sweet, and overall complex flavor.",
