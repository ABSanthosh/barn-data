Suddenly, there’s no shortage of cocktail hours, gift-wrapping parties, and cookie swaps that usually come with the need for a baked good or two. Thankfully, we have more than 2,000 cookie recipes on our site—and so we sifted through them all for the best recipes for swapping, gifting, and eating this season. We of course included the classics like thumbprints, spritz, and gingerbread, but we’ve also included some new recipes that are guaranteed to be the stars of any gathering, big or small. Not only are these treats crowd-pleasers, but they’re also make-ahead friendly, easy to transport, and perfect for batching—whether you’re swapping dozens or just keeping a few for yourself. Trust us, you’ll want to bake these whether or not you’ve got a party on the calendar. 1. Salted Tahini Chocolate Chip Cookies A twist on the classic chocolate chip cookie, Danielle Oron’s recipe combines the nutty richness of tahini with the perfect balance of sweet and salty. Make sure to add extra flaky salt on top to really enhance all the flavors. 2. Brownie Whoopie Pies Paola Velez's brownie whoopie pies are perfect for anyone who loves a good mix of cookie and cake in one bit. While they’re not technically a traditional holiday cookie, we don’t think anyone at the cookie swap will mind. 3. Holiday Crinkle Cookies A holiday staple, these crinkle cookies have a light fudgy center and powdered sugar coating that gives them a snowy, festive look. We guarantee they'll disappear in no time. 4. Snowball Cookies If you’re going to make a snowball cookie, we highly recommend using celebrity pastry chef Duff Goldman’s recipe. They’re the quintessential holiday treat—buttery, crumbly, and dusted in extra powdered sugar. 5. Swedish Pecan Praline Cookies These traditional Swedish cookies are a delightful balance of crunchy pecans and sweet caramelized pralines. The result is a perfect mix of a buttery shortbread and rich toffee. Once again, flaky sea salt is the perfect finishing touch. From Our Shop 6. Classic Sugar Cookies These roll out sugar cookies from Erin Jeanne McDowell have a soft and buttery center with a crisp outer edge. The most joyous party is that you can decorate them with sprinkles, icing, or cut into festive shapes—choose your own holiday adventure 7. Fruitcake Cookies For those who love the flavors of a fruitcake, but want a lower effort, more portable version, these fruitcake cookies deliver all that and more. It’s all the dried fruit, nuts, and spices in a chewy bite-sized form, with lots of room for customization. 8. Leftover Halloween Candy Cookies If you still have leftover Halloween candy (or are starting to get holiday candy), we recommend chopping it up and making a batch of Nea’s cookies. You can customize these however you want by mixing in a variety of chocolate bits to the buttery dough. 9. Red Velvet Cookies Our theory: You can’t go wrong with a red velvet anything. These cookies are guaranteed crowd-pleasers with their soft, slightly tangy dough, white chocolate chip mix-ins, and powdered sugar topping. Plus, their rich color makes them a festive choice for any holiday party. 10. Figgy Pudding Butter Cookies Inspired by the traditional British dessert, these figgy pudding butter cookies are studded with dried figs and a blend of winter spices. The result is a rich cookie with a sophisticated holiday flavor that’s sure to impress. 11. Maple and brown sugar oatmeal cookies For a cozy and comforting option, look no further than these maple and brown sugar oatmeal cookies—aka the best oatmeal flavor in cookie form. The dough blends oats, maple syrup, and brown sugar with some hints of cinnamon and nutmeg, creating a truly holiday-esque flavor. 12. Rum Ball cookies These classic rum ball cookies bring a little boozy bite to the holiday dessert table. Made with crushed cookies, cocoa, and a splash of rum, the final product gets rolled in powdered sugar, making them look extra festive. 13. Salted Rosemary Shortbread If you’re looking to make a more elevated holiday cookie this season, this salted rosemary shortbread recipe is your answer. Savory notes from fresh rosemary perfectly complement the buttery richness of the shortbread, while the touch of flaky salt on top helps to balance the sweetness. 14. Roasted Chestnut and Fig thumbprint cookies Since everyone will be making classic thumbprint cookies, consider switching things up with this roasted chestnut and fig version instead. The mix of toasty, warm flavors from the chestnuts, paired with dollops of sweet jam creates a delicious twist on the traditional favorite. 15. Espresso Martini Cookies A cocktail in cookie form, these espresso martini cookies will give everyone a jolt at your next holiday party. The chocolate dipping takes a little extra time, but trust us when we say it's worth it. 16. Flourless Salted Hot Chocolate cookies These flourless salted hot chocolate cookies are less effort than a flourless chocolate cake, but just as delicious. They’re rich, fudgy, and your gluten-free party guests will love you. They’re also the ideal cookie for any chocolate-lover on your holiday list. 17. Ginger Cookies Spicy, chewy, and just the right amount of sweet, these ginger cookies are the epitome of holiday comfort. The combination of cinnamon, cloves, and ginger give them that warm, aromatic kick that everyone craves this time of year. 18. Chocolate Peppermint Sables If you’re willing to spend a little extra time on cookie decoration, we can’t recommend these chocolate peppermint sables enough. Not only are they visually impressive, but the combination of dark chocolate and fresh peppermint makes them a cool (literally) treat. 19. Spritz Butter Cookies These spritz butter cookies are a holiday classic for a good reason. They’re perfectly bite-sized and melt-in-your-mouth, ideal for when you want to try as many cookies as possible. Whether piped into festive shapes or adorned with sprinkles, they’re always a good idea. 20. Chocolate Almond Cherry Cookies For a flavor combination that will set you apart from all the sugar cookies at the party, try these chocolate almond cherry cookies. You get a nice richness from the dark chocolate, a crunch from almonds, and a burst of tartness from the cherries, which makes it a perfectly balanced cookie. We want to know: What is your favorite holiday cookie?",
