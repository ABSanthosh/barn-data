This week in Bellville, I made a Chicken Pot Pie for a new friend who’s going through something hard—because what else can I do when life feels overwhelming besides wrap it in pie crust? (Rhetorical) Just as I was standing at my kitchen counter, flour in my hair – I could feel it, crimping the crust wondering what I was going to eat for dinner… my neighbor texted. He’d made too much supper, and left a pot on my porch. I hustled out there barefoot like it was Christmas morning and found: half a roasted chicken, smashed potatoes with bacon, corn, and spinach. A full plate of kindness and a generous wave and holler hello from across the street.  It was perfect (and so was the pot pie, I might add). This is your reminder that the nice thing, the thoughtful text, porch pie, or extra scoop of mashed potatoes? It all comes back around. Don’t hesitate with it. Let’s just be the good neighbors this week without a bunch of pomp and circumstance and see how it all shakes out. The offering this week is below.  A picture of Graham shaking paw is above. Take good care and maybe go rummaging through the craft closet just for funsies: •  The most powerful long read of the week. This story stayed with me. It’s a personal, detailed account of survival and silence, and a reminder of how important it is that we listen—truly listen—to one another’s stories, even the ones that are hard to tell, and harder still to write.  This is the Holocaust Story I Said I Wouldn’t Write. (The New York Times Gift Article) •  I relate all to hard to Millennial Hobby Energy. Exhibit A: my entire career. Exhibit B: my craft closet. Exhibit C: the garage bakery I’m starting currently in my mind’s eye and soon to be in my actual garage.  Is this you too? (Substack) •  I’ve never been very keen on using my very BODY to keep up with women’s beauty trends and wow – maybe that’s what’s about to be trendy? Untouched Faces Are Having a Moment on TikTok – But Will They Last? Gen Z is making a case for being “a lil ugly” which is exactly the case I’ve been making since my awkward teen years so – great! Here we are! (Cosmopolitan) •  Let’s spend some time with April’s micromoon this weekend.  (TIME) •  Emily Schuman offered 12 self-care rituals that actually made a difference and I can very much co-sign turning down your bedroom a few hours before bedtime. It’s  turn down service, lavender spray. (Substack) •  We all know someone who could use a hug or a Double Crust Chicken Pot Pie right now. And I can tell you from experience – if you’re going to make one chicken pot pie, you might as well make two (which is exactly why I have a pot pie in my fridge right now). I’m not always great with giving hugs, but I am great with giving pies. (Joy the Baker) •  I am, certifiably, this nosy so this new podcast about OPM (Other People’s Money) is really compelling to me.  What We Spend Podcast (TikTok, Apple) •  Are you a wet hair sleeper? Here are some things to consider (like… a moldy pillow!?) (Self) •  I’m convinced that HOAs exist to make us petty together. (TikTok) •  If you didn’t get the memo, consider this it – We’re growing radishes. It’s very simple and they’re lovely vessels for salted butter this spring and summer. (Hudson Valley Seed, YouTube) •  We’re invited to a Good Friday Crawfish Boil next week and there’s few things I love more than a Lenten fish gathering! The host and hostess are Food Folks® and I’m brainstorming bringing them a crusty loaf of bread and a vegetable bouquet as a host gift. I’m notoriously terrible at flower arranging but maybe if it’s food, I’ll be better equipped? (Joy the Baker, Gardens Illustrated) •  It’s never not Fun Little Drink season. I feel like I need to reach beyond the hibiscus lemonade I’ve been making nearly every week and this Beet Sumac Soda might be just weird enough to pass muster. (Bon Appetit) Have a lovely day, friends! Get after this Sunday! xo Joy",
