My work's been published by Hearst, PureWow, and Bauer Media Group. I'm a Brooklyn-born Jersey Girl (with a BA in English from Montclair State University) who loves a good playlist, a good bagel, and my family (but not necessarily in that order).published yesterdayWe independently select these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.It’s no secret that in order to have a properly functioning kitchen, you need to be organized. And for those who love a bit of design, we’re lucky to be living in a time where you don’t have to sacrifice your taste to have a place for everything and everything in its place. So yes, stylish kitchen organizers are easier to find than ever before, but where should you be looking? Personally, whenever I need some storage that won’t cramp my style — be it for my kitchen, bedroom, or really any space of my home — I always check out Umbra. The brand is beloved for its wide selection of pieces that expertly mix style and function. Case in point: The Umbra Bellwood Countertop Organizer, a special find I’m confident is about to become the one organizer you love to show off everywhere, from your kitchen counter to your dining table and beyond. What Is the Umbra Bellwood Countertop Organizer? This pick is a stylish take on the classic turntable organizer (also sometimes referred to as a “lazy Susan”) and is the perfect choice for anyone looking to get their kitchen in order with a bit of flair. It features a stunning 360-degree rotating wood base with removable dividers, which makes it a versatile find that can seamlessly adapt to your kitchen’s needs over time.While its chic design makes it something you’ll likely want to keep on display, this pick is also a great find for cabinets and pantries, as its turntable design makes it easy to access essentials in hard-to-reach spaces. Measuring in at 12″W x 12”L x 3″H, it’s spacious without overtaking your counter, which makes it a perfect solution for everyday items like oils, vinegars, and spices.Reviewers also mention loving to use this organizer on their tabletop for things like vitamins and napkins, as well as for personal care items like makeup and skincare in other rooms of their home. Wherever there’s a need for organizing, this pick is sure to declutter with style.What Amazon Shoppers Are SayingAverage rating: 4.6/5 stars “I bought this product because I wanted to get an item that could help me declutter and organize my kitchen counters and this product was perfect! Visually, it’s very cute and with its minimalistic colors, it will fit into any space/color scheme. Functionality-wise, it was able to hold a lot of containers (from big/tall oil bottles to small bottles of seasoning and spices) and it spins very smoothly. I really like the rotation mechanism because it allowed me to easily access whichever item it was that I needed. Organizationally, it definitely helped me put items into one place, instead of just having everything laid out on the counter. Surprisingly, this item was very easy to clean as well. I accidentally spilled a little bit of cayenne pepper in it but I just wiped it up and it didn’t stain at all.” —Amazon Customer “This lazy Susan is a game-changer for my pantry! It’s both stylish and functional, with a gorgeous bamboo base and a sleek white divider. The best part? It spins like a dream, making it easy to reach all those condiments hiding in the back. It’s sturdy enough to hold even heavy bottles, but not so heavy itself that it weighs down the shelf. Bonus points for the removable dividers that let me customize the compartments. Definitely adding more of these to my kitchen!” —Esoterica “We ended up using this as a centerpiece for condiments, napkins, etc. The rolling action is smooth. The board itself is hefty yet easy to swivel. The plastic center piece can be removed, which we did so that we could fit more items. There’s also the raised edge/lip so items do go flying off when spinning it around. I feel this is worth every dime spent – recommend!” —SuperUser2023 Ready to add this stunner to your kitchen?
