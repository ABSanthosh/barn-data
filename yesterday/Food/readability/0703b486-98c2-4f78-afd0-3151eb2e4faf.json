I love making a huge spread for my family and friends! Over the years I’ve shared my Thanksgiving timeline and it’s been insanely helpful – especially to me! I look back on these posts on the actual day and follow them exactly. I’m making a full spread and it’s always our best CLASSICS – my family only wants the traditional dishes on Thanksgiving Day. I don’t change a ton in terms of dishes I’ll be serving, and now that I have kids, it helps me SO much to be able to plan and organize in advance. It allows me to enjoy the day so much. Because I love cooking a giant spread for everyone! I shared a post of all my Thanksgiving kitchen essentials, so be sure to check that out in case you still need to grab anything! If you want to see a timeline for four weeks out, check out my 2020 timeline. THE MENU Butter White Wine Roasted Turkey Turkey Stock Buttery Herb Stuffing  How Sweet Eats House Mashed Potatoes The Best Gravy Ever Pomegranate Greens Salad Vanilla Bourbon Cranberry Sauce Lightened Up Sweet Potato Casserole Green Bean Casserole Scalloped Corn Parker House Rolls Pomegranate Jeweled Cheeseball Pumpkin Dream Cake Salted Chocolate Pecan Pie Bars Red Apple Cider Sangria THE WEEK BEFORE: I do a massive fridge clean. I clean the entire fridge, get rid of what I don’t need, make room for the turkey, the dishes I’ll make ahead of time, etc. I go over my master list again and see what else I may need. THANKSGIVING WEEK SATURDAY I grocery shop for the things that are fresh but will last until Thursday, such as milk, potatoes, squash, etc. I also think about next weekend and a lunch and dinner plan right now. I know that at some point we will be sick of leftovers and won’t want to eat out every single meal (and will want something light!) so I try to plan a light meal or two and have some things on hand for easy lunches and dinners during the long weekend. SUNDAY I do any miscellaneous house things and regular life things that must get done to live. Ha! Things like laundry, etc. MONDAY I go over my list again. DO I HAVE EVERYTHING? Probably not. I always forget things. I clean out my dining room and set the table. I set up my own centerpiece space – or at least as much of it as I can. I also like to set out all of my serving and baking dishes with post-it’s of what will go inside. TUESDAY This is house cleaning day! Whether I do it, or it gets professionally cleaned. I do one final grocery shop. Grabbing anything else I may need. I pick up the turkey(s). I prep my dry brine (2.5 T salt + 2t sugar) and prep my turkey, get it all together and stick it in the fridge, UNCOVERED. Let the magic happen. I make my turkey stock. This is SO worth it. Plus, it’s easy. It’s a lot of downtime once it gets going. I make the chocolate pecan pie bars and stick them in the fridge! WEDNESDAY I’m making the lightened up sweet potato casserole. I don’t bake it yet, but cover it and stick it in the fridge. I measure out the topping ingredients and set them aside for tomorrow. I’ve done this for 7 years and it works great! This is a great dish to bring if you are going to someone else’s house. I also make the green bean casserole. I make it up until the point of baking, then store it in the fridge. And I’m making the cranberry sauce, the pumpkin dream cake and prepping the bread and veggies for the stuffing. I leave the bread in baking dishes and sauté the vegetables, then stick them in jars in the fridge. I frost, cover and refrigerate the cake. I peel the potatoes and place them in a pot of cold water in the fridge. I prep the parker house roll dough and bake the rolls before bed. This is a lot of prep, but it makes Thursday go super smoothly. Before I go to sleep, I make sure that the kitchen is clean and the dishwasher is running! THANKSGIVING DAY 9:30AM: Turkey comes out of the fridge to take the chill off. 10:30AM: Prep the cheesecloth, butter/wine mixture for the turkey. 10:45AM: Turkey is stuffed (if you want), legs trussed, ready to go. 11AM: Turkey goes into the oven! A 15lb turkey using this recipe takes about 4 hours. I’m giving myself more time for a slightly larger turkey. I set an alarm on my phone so I know when to baste the turkey, but only do it every 60 minutes or so. I personally don’t even think it needs it. I run the dishwasher again if needed, only so I can have a completely empty dishwasher after dinner! 12PM: I make the sangria and keep it in the fridge. Also make sure coffee and dessert space is prepped! This is also when I shower and get ready myself. 2 PM to 3PM: I make the mashed potatoes. I make them fully, but I keep them warm in a slow cooker until dinner. I make the halloumi for the salad. I take other dishes out of the fridge that have to be heated soon, like the sweet potatoes, green bean casserole, corn and the cranberry sauce. Then I clean up the mess that I probably made. 4PM: It’s snack time. Pomegranate cheese ball coming right up! Roll it in the pomegranate arils and set it out to eat. 4PM: Take the turkey temperatures. Our parents come! We eat and snack and chat. 5PM: Turkey is out of the oven and resting for 30 to 45 minutes. Side dishes that have to be warmed/baked go into the oven. I start making the gravy. I love the gravy made fresh with the turkey drippings. I follow my exact recipe! It’s worth it, trust me. It does reheat well if you make it ahead of time. I throw together the salad quickly. Everything is measured, washed, made and chopped so it takes a few minutes! 5:30PM: Eddie carves the turkeys! 5:45PM: Fill up water and wine glasses, sides come out of the oven, everything is set out and arranged for serving. 6PM: Give thanks and EAT. I live for this day. This week! Truly. It’s all the prep  – that’s where the fun is.",

A 15lb turkey using this recipe takes about 4 hours. I’m giving myself more time for a slightly larger turkey. I set an alarm on my phone so I know when to baste the turkey, but only do it every 60 minutes or so. I personally don’t even think it needs it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI run the dishwasher again if needed, only so I can have a completely empty dishwasher after dinner!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e12PM\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI make the sangria and keep it in the fridge.
