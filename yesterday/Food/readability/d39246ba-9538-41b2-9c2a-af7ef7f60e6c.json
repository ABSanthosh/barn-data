All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Amy Sussman/Getty ImagesWhether you’re a Kraft, Annie’s, Goodles, or Cabot fan, we can all agree that there’s nothing more reliable than a box of mac and cheese. In its purest form, it shines. But when you get creative by sprucing it up, it can transform into an even more satisfying dish. Whether you lean on freezer staples like frozen peas or spicy condiments like pickled jalapeños, there are countless routes you can take to upgrade your pasta. Recently Giada De Laurentiis offered a fun boxed mac tip that is so ingenious yet simple: The celebrity chef swirls in pre-made vodka sauce.  In a recent clip on Giada’s Instagram, she meticulously transforms a box of Annie’s Real Aged Cheddar mac and cheese. She starts by swapping the traditional shells that come in the package (completely optional) with Gnocchetti Napoletani from her brand, Giadzy. Then she cooks “half a box” of that pasta according to the package instructions and finishes it with milk, butter, Annie’s powdered cheese, about half a jar of vodka sauce, and a handful of shredded mozzarella cheese.Giada’s fans raced to the comments to share their excitement about this delicious hack. One person commented, “Oh, this looks so cozy and comforting!” while another mentioned, “Vodka sauce mac and cheese is genius.”In the caption of this Instagram tutorial, Giada points out her inspiration from a recipe shared initially by digital creator Erin Silberman. While Giada and Silberman don’t recommend which vodka sauce they prefer, luckily we recently reviewed one from Carbone and noted that it is “so good,” with a “bright tomato flavor.”According to Giada, this is one of the top meals she and her daughter, Jade, love to enjoy on a “cozy Friday night in.” If you’re searching for a comforting twist to your boxed mac and cheese, this simple hack won’t take up much time (plus, it looks delicious!) — so why not give this recipe a go?",
