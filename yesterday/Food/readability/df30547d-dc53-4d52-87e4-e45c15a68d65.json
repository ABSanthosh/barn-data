  "description": "This is list #460. For this I LOVE LISTS, I will reflect on the past year, here online. Thank you for being here and keeping me going. If you have a moment, say hi and tell me something you’re proud of in 2024.  I want to be proud of you, too. xo 24 things from 2024  I made this soup the most this year. I figured out my favorite things \u0026 shared them. So many new favorite workout videos have been added to my life.  I have been living a mostly non-alcoholic life in 2024. Started 2024 with Everyday Magic, researching myself.  Spread some LOVE.  A bunch of meal prep lists were shared.  Here are all the months of 2024 in my Currently Workbook. (I’m working on Dec now) I documented the whole process as I created it/a youtube channel.  My manifesting worked. I made an idea a reality. I showed off my green thumb \u0026 gardening prowess.  It took me 10 years to figure out my baseball bag essentials. Active grieving in the form of a podcast helped me find meaning + friendship in loss. I completed 14 years of documenting My Everyday Life. My mom was here for 7 of them.  7 years of committing to sharing my Intentions for the Week.  My word for the year was Ritual, and I made one that brings me so much joy with Self-Check-In.  All the art I made for my lists this year. All things I meditated on.  I released my calendar printable pack and taught it with meal prep in a binder class this year.  Did some spring cleaning and made a collage kit.  Morning pages were done the way that works for me. My planner brain shared how I prep for Thanksgiving. I cultivated more planning in my life here.  Which lead me to do some redesigning of my Currently Workbook.  Thank you for not going anywhere. There’s still so much TO DO.      Need some help processing 2024 and prepping for 2025?
