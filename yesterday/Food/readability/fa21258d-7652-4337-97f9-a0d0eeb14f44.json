Once I moved out of the apartment, I rented as a student and into my first “adult” place, I realized that I was seriously lacking in quality cookware and tools. The ones I did own weren’t really built to stand the test of time. The situation wasn’t all that dire when I was dividing my time between class and the library, but I figured it needed to change once I started my full-time job. In the two-ish years since graduation, I’ve made a ton of progress. My random Amazon knife set was ditched in favor of a real chef’s knife. My Keurig was tossed for an espresso machine. My random nonstick pans from Target were traded in for a stainless steel set. Still, I wasn’t grabbing the most expensive upgrades on the market — maybe one day I’ll decide to splurge on pricey brands like Le Creuset and All-Clad — but they’ve still completely transformed my experience in the kitchen. This past fall, I snagged an item that was entirely new to me — it wasn’t replacing something else — but I’d been wanting for a while: a Dutch oven. Naturally, I wasn’t about to grab one for over $300, but I didn’t want to randomly grab the first affordable option I saw. When I finally came across Quince’s Enameled Cast Iron 6.5-quart Dutch Oven, I knew it was the one, and several winter comfort meals later, my suspicions have been confirmed. Here’s why you should grab it before it sells out again.What Is Quince’s Enameled Cast-Iron 6.5QT Dutch Oven?Quince is mostly known for its high-quality, well-priced clothes and bedding, so you might not be aware that it has recently branched out to cookware. I, however, have been on the Quince cookware train since the early days of its launch. My aforementioned stainless steel cookware? Quince. Almost a year later, it’s still my go-to. When I saw that a Dutch oven was added to its lineup, I had to try it out immediately.Made of durable enameled cast iron — same as those pricier options — this piece is suited for slow cooking, braising, roasting, soup-making, and more. Oven-safe up to 500º F, the material heats up evenly and retains it, while the coating makes cleanup effortless. It also has the benefit of extending its life by holding off rust and corrosion, all while being free of PFAs, PFOAs, PTFEs, BPAs, lead, and cadmium. Further, underneath the lid, you’ll find drip points that capture and return moisture to the food inside of it, and the ivory color and gold hardware will instantly brighten up your stovetop.Why I Love Quince’s Dutch OvenEven though this is my first foray into Dutch ovens, I don’t think I’ll ever need to buy another. Though I know performance is more important than looks, I can’t help but appreciate how stunning this gem looks sitting permanently on my stovetop. For its appearance alone, it’s worth sacrificing a burner, but I’ve used it enough this past winter that it’s worth it for that, too. I like the design of Quince’s Dutch oven: I prefer its gold hardware and the lack of logos also appeals to me. Overall, it feels minimal and luxurious.Of course, a stylish design isn’t all it has to offer. In terms of performance, this piece has won over not only me, but my grandma, too. She’s the ultimate cook, so I take her opinion very seriously. When I was stuck in bed with a torn Achilles tendon this past fall, she stayed with me in my apartment to help. She put the Dutch oven to work soon after, whipping up a delicious pot roast. After braising the beef, it turned out so tender, and the veggies were roasted to perfection. I’ve achieved stellar results with chili and soup, too — the liquids came to a boil fast for its size — and the capacity was excellent for making large amounts that I could eat for the rest of the week. Cleanup was more painless than I expected, too. It’s certainly hefty, but the handles made it easy enough to shift from my stovetop to my sink. I’ll admit that after scooping the chili out, I let it sit for a day before I got around to scrubbing it. Luckily, I didn’t have to scrub endlessly. It took only a few minutes of scrubbing before it was spotless again. I may not have owned a Dutch oven prior, but my grandma has, and she says it’s comparable to the fancier brands. A Quince shopper says the same in the reviews: “I have a Staub cocotte that I love, but I was looking for something a bit bigger,” they wrote. “This Dutch oven does it! The quality matches the staub for a fraction of the cost.”If you’re in the same boat as me and aren’t quite ready to drop a couple hundred bucks on your cookware, then Quince’s Dutch oven is a fantastic option. It’s an essential for all of those hearty winter meals and meal prepping — just make sure you grab it sooner than later because it’s sold out repeatedly since I got it a few months ago!My Kitchn HelperGet our favorite editor-tested and -approved finds sent twice a week to your inbox.",

Though I know performance is more important than looks, I can’t help but appreciate how stunning this gem looks sitting permanently on my stovetop. For its appearance alone, it’s worth sacrificing a burner, but I’ve used it enough this past winter that it’s worth it for that, too.

Overall, it feels minimal and luxurious.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"Post__item\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, a stylish design isn’t all it has to offer. In terms of performance, this piece has won over not only me, but my grandma, too. She’s the ultimate cook, so I take her opinion very seriously. When I was stuck in bed with a torn Achilles tendon this past fall, she stayed with me in my apartment to help. She put the Dutch oven to work soon after, whipping up a delicious pot roast. After braising the beef, it turned out \u003cem\u003eso\u003c/em\u003e tender, and the veggies were roasted to perfection. I’ve achieved stellar results with chili and soup, too — the liquids came to a boil fast for its size — and the capacity was excellent for making large amounts that I could eat for the rest of the week. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"Post__item\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eCleanup was more painless than I expected, too. It’s certainly hefty, but the handles made it easy enough to shift from my stovetop to my sink. I’ll admit that after scooping the chili out, I let it sit for a day before I got around to scrubbing it. Luckily, I didn’t have to scrub endlessly. It took only a few minutes of scrubbing before it was spotless again. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"Post__item\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eI may not have owned a Dutch oven prior, but my grandma has, and she says it’s comparable to the fancier brands. A Quince shopper says the same in the reviews: “I have a Staub cocotte that I love, but I was looking for something a bit bigger,” they wrote. “\u003ca href=\"https://atmedia.link/product?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quince.com%2Fhome%2Fenameled-cast-iron-dutch-oven\u0026amp;referralSource=%7BREFERRAL_SOURCE%7D\u0026amp;id=23704679\u0026amp;site=KT\u0026amp;refUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thekitchn.com%2Fquince-dutch-oven-review-ll-23704679\" data-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:5243543024041984\" data-link-type=\"product\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" data-gtm-teaser-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:5243543024041984\" data-gtm-teaser-product-name=\"Enameled Cast Iron 6.5-Quart Dutch Oven\" data-gtm-teaser-product-price=\"79.90\" data-gtm-teaser-product-retailers=\"Quince\" data-gtm-teaser-product-tags=\"cookware-dutch-oven\" data-gtm-teaser-product-url=\"https://www.quince.com/home/enameled-cast-iron-dutch-oven\" data-gtm-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:5243543024041984\" data-gtm-product-name=\"Enameled Cast Iron 6.5-Quart Dutch Oven\" data-gtm-product-price=\"79.90\" data-gtm-product-retailers=\"Quince\" data-gtm-product-tags=\"cookware-dutch-oven\" data-gtm-product-url=\"https://www.quince.com/home/enameled-cast-iron-dutch-oven\"\u003eThis Dutch oven\u003c/a\u003e does it!
