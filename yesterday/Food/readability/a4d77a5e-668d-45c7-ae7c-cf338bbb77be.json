Cherry Republic cherry vanilla coffee. I bought this in august and have enjoyed it so so much. The flavor is phenomenal. I used it in my breville and make lattes. American Spoon hot cocoa mix. Another huge win. The kids love hot chocolate, I love it once every month or so. This one is excellent. HOME Cedar garland. I got this garland for our mantel and staircase this year. It’s awesome. It looks very natural and real. It also feels super cool and is easy to hang. Tineco Vacuum Mop. Another repeat. I’ve mentioned this so much but it saves my life daily! Now that we’re in party mode here (the kids’ bdays + holidays), using this after gatherings is so satisfying. Also gross. But super satisfying! Hotel Lobby Lodge candle. This was my favorite candle last year. It’s warm but smoky but fresh. It smells delicious and is the perfect scent for winter. BEAUTY Elemis Cleansing Oil. I’ve searched far and wide for a cleansing oil I loved as much as the MAC one before they changed it. I’ve tried so many. Just recently got this one and it’s the winner. I wish is wasn’t so expensive, but it’s worth it. Def my fave one. MAC pink peppermint lipstick. I’m pretty sure this is a new shade from MAC and I love it. It’s the perfect lavender/cool toned pink/almost nude. I am in love! I bought two just in case it gets discontinued. Lawless lip balm in sweetie. This color is another one I am loving. Again, it’s a nude shade with lots of sparkle that is perfect when you do a smoky eye. And these balms are great. I have them in many other colors too. Fenty toasted marshmallow body cream. Best scent ever. I like even more than the cinnamon one from last year. It is shimmery, so that can be annoying depending on what you wear. But it smells so good. Laneige eggnog latte lip mask. I thought this would smell gross but it smells incredible! Like warm vanilla cappuccino. Adore it. FASHION Varley coffee bean sweatshirt. I’m living for this shade of brown this year. And the varley fabric just can’t be beat. It’s such high quality. I’ve worn this nonstop. Leopard faux fur peacoat. Favorite find of the fall. Leopard has always been my favorite neutral so I’m going crazy over it this year. Got this coat and adore it. Lululemon sherpa restfeel slides. These are SO comfortable. I want every color. Got the black, but want the others! Cushionaire cozy mule. This ugg knock off is one I got last year and it’s great. Sure, it’s ugly, but it’s super comfortable. It can be a slipper but I also wear it on the school runs! MEDIA Life on Svalbard. I have been waiting for this and we are SO excited over it. Max, Emilia and I have watched Cecilia on youtube for years. Seeing it come to life in her book is incredible. Variation. This was my fave read of the month! I love Rebecca Yarros stand alone novels and this one did not disappoint. The Wicked Sountrack. We can’t stop listening. The end. KIDS Kids’ smart watch. Emilia got this for her birthday and she loves it. It’s so cheap and dinky but it’s her favorite thing ever. Now all my kids want one. It has games too. Fisher Price Wicked Little People. I’ve bought four of these for gifts so far and Jordan has them too. We love little people!! So cute. All the kids are enjoying them. Perfect Practice putting mat. My kids are OBSESSED with this. We’ve had it for a few years and they still use it almost daily. It’s great for a basement or even can go outside in warm weather. We love it.
