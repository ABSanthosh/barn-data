Growing up, she moved constantly, hopping between apartments, neighborhoods, and countries. So when she found a rent-stabilized Brooklyn apartment on Craigslist in 2011, she knew she was staying put. “I think that's the reason why I haven't left—it's so nice because this space is mine,” she said. Fourteen years later, she’s still there, and if she has her way, she’s keeping it in the family for as long as possible. The recipe developer and design obsessive describes her aesthetic as a modern take on a ’70s basement, balancing vintage finds with fresh, contemporary touches. Her walls are an ever-changing gallery of posters, a collection she’s built over the years. “If a concert has a screen-printed poster, I buy it,” she said. Stacey has continually reinvented her apartment, swapping out art, furniture, and decor to match her evolving tastes. Most recently, after a bathroom ceiling collapse led to a full renovation, she saw an opportunity rather than an inconvenience. She enlisted her friend Kate Zaremba, a wallpaper designer, and together, they covered the new walls in a bold wavy black-and-white pattern. A few simple swaps later, and in less than a week, her bathroom felt brand new. Curious how she makes a rental feel like home? We caught up with Stacey to dive into the project and get her best tips for refreshing a space without starting from scratch. Kate Zaremba Wiggle wallpaper in Peppercorn and Wedding Bells Blue Photo by Kate Zaremba The first thing Stacey did when she moved in was paint the walls. \"Stock white just wasn’t for me,\" she said. But more recently, she’s sworn by wallpaper. \"It completely transformed the space. Typically, you can only change things up by painting, but wallpaper felt like the way to go.\" While wallpaper might seem like a big undertaking, Stacey insists it’s actually easier—and much cleaner than grabbing a gallon of eggshell. “I think people are intimidated by it, but you just have to be patient and set the time aside. And if you’re renting (like Stacey)? No worries—she notes that wallpaper can always be steamed off or even painted over. Stacey’s approach to design is simple: nothing in your home has to be permanent. “Since I’ve been in my apartment so long, I redo the space every few years—just to keep it fresh.” Whether it’s wallpaper, paint, or through rearranging furniture, she believes in changing things up as often as you like. “If you don’t end up loving it, take a beat and switch it out. It’s a long project, and that’s what’s lovely about it,” she said. If you’re renting, she recommended keeping original fixtures stored in labeled bags for easy swaps once you move out. As for paint, “Just don’t go with black,” she warned. Another super simple way to update your space is changing out light switch covers. “The ones in rentals are usually painted over a thousand times,” Stacey said. She found unique ones on Etsy and has her eye on designs by artist Lorien Stern—specifically, these ghost-like figures that add a playful touch. She also suggests centering a design around a favorite object or piece of art. “Pulling colors and inspiration from one standout piece can help create a cohesive look,” she said. Whether it’s a concert poster or a vintage print, start small, and build from there. Photo by Kate Zaremba Although installing the wallpaper took just a few hours, it was made even easier—and way more fun—with some extra hands. “When the idea of wallpapering the bathroom felt intimidating, Kate [Zaremba] said she’d help us install it,” Stacey said. Her roommate had worked with Kate before, and was in on the project from the start. “That’s kind of the New York, Brooklyn way—you know someone who knows someone,” she said. That said, Stacey and her roommate, both design school grads, could have managed on their own. They mapped everything out to scale on paper first, set up cutting and wetting stations, and used an X-Acto knife to get every seam just right. Over the years, Stacey has embraced a slower, more intentional approach to decorating. “I mull over things, and I think that makes the end result so much more satisfying,” she said. The same went for choosing wallpaper—she and Kate sifted through different prints before finding the perfect one. “We wanted something fun, bold, and graphic, but not just a typical stripe—so the wiggle design was perfect.” “People try to do everything at once—they hang all their art in one day,” she said. “But as someone who’s been in her space a long time, there are still things I haven’t hung because I’m still thinking about them.” But the wallpaper is up—for now at least.
