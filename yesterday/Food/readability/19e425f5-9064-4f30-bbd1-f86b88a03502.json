As someone who loves food trends, I couldn’t resist digging into what I think we’ll see more of this year. To get a better sense, I turned to Instagram and Slack, asking friends, coworkers, and our Food52 community for their takes. While a few rogue ideas made it through, certain trends stood out repeatedly. Here’s what we think is likely to shape the food scene in 2025. Big soda Is Back, Baby Over the past few years, we’ve seen the rise of healthy-ish soda brands like Olipop, Culture Pop, and Poppi, marketing carbonated drinks as an gut-friendly alternative to traditional soda.

Big soda Is Back, Baby Over the past few years, we’ve seen the rise of healthy-ish soda brands like Olipop, Culture Pop, and Poppi, marketing carbonated drinks as an gut-friendly alternative to traditional soda. But this year, with the help of unpaid (and most likely, some paid) celebrity endorsement such as Dua Lipa, classics like Coca-Cola, Dr. Pepper, and Canada Dry are stepping back into the spotlight. Guinness and Savory Cocktails Are Here To Stay Guinness has seen a resurgence in female drinkers thanks to —what else?—Tiktok and the trend of “splitting the G”. Sales have been up 6 percent in the past year, and I don’t see this trend dying any time soon. While I’ve never been one to order a Guinness, because I’m a very easily influenced person, I wouldn’t be surprised if I get one next time I’m out. When it comes to savory cocktails, I think it’s only the beginning. Bars and restaurants are upping the ante with interesting, desirable flavors, from Double Chicken Please’s Pizza Cocktail in Manhattan to Pebble Bar’s Everything Bagel Martini (in partnership with Black Seed Bagel). Although I’m sure you could find a spot that serves a savory drink in your area, for a DIY option, I recommend this Feta Brine Martini by Emma Laperruque. The Rise of Cannabis Drinks While we’re on the topic of drinks, let's not ignore the fact that cannabis is making its way into beverages, changing the way we think about drinking and consuming THC. Brands like Cann offer low-dose THC sodas (2 to 5 mg per can) that combine aesthetic branding with tasty flavors like Cranberry Sage, while others, like Nowadays, offer THC “liquor,” which you can buy in 750ml bottles and serve in shots . Seth Rogen’s Houseplant even launched sparkling waters with a hit of THC. The trend makes sense, considering Gen Z’s preferences for non-alcoholic cocktails and more mindful drinking and partying. Either sip lightly for just a little buzz, or go all-in. Either way, you won’t have to worry about hangover. Retro Classics Go Modern Old-school American comfort foods are back, and this time it’s more than just shrimp cocktail. Dishes like deviled eggs and meatloaf (like at Williamsburg’s Kellogg’s Diner) have been making a comeback since last summer, and the momentum is only building. Hopefully, more crockpots coming out of storage, and hearty, nostalgic, comfort food classic dominating kitchen tables in 2025. Speaking of—what nostalgic dish should I make next? What food trend do you think will be big in 2025? Let me know below!",
