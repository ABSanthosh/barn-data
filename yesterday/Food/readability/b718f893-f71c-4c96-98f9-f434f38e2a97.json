Food Stylist: Samantha Seneviratne.Genevieve KoGenevieve Ko has baked more than 60 birthday cakes for her kids, including one shaped like a pirate ship.May 7, 2025, 1:29 p.m. ETOn my first day as a line cook in a pastry kitchen, I was tasked with turning lemons into little bowls for housemade sorbet. I angled a sharp paring knife from the edge of a lemon half toward its center, then circled the knife to slice out a cone of seedy yellow flesh. Cupping that emptied half, I scooped out what remained with a metal spoon. Once the glassy sheets of membranes were gone, I had to keep going, gently running the spoon against the pith to create the thinnest possible shell without tearing the peel.That continuous scraping, the gentle pressure to excavate everything inside: That’s what empty nesting has felt like. Somewhere behind my rib cage, some core is being hollowed out, and the rasping feels especially close on occasions like Mother’s Day.Recipe: Easy Carrot Cake With Cream Cheese FrostingWhen they were young, my kids felt pressure from relatives, teachers and the America around them to uphold the breakfast-in-bed tradition that started in the 1930s, about 15 years after Mother’s Day was declared a national holiday. Aside from the fact that I’m not a breakfast eater, I’m also uninterested in doing twice as many dishes and washing syrup stains out of the duvet cover.I’m not alone — according to a 2017 Zagat poll, only 4 percent of mothers actually want breakfast in bed. But I may be alone in wanting to spend the day cooking.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
