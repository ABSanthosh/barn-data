    "description": "The Xiaomi 16 is expected to be unveiled in late September, right after Qualcomm announces the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 SoC that will be powering it. Ahead of that, today we have an alleged CAD-based sketch of the device to look at, showing us its design. As you can see, it's a refinement of the Xiaomi 15's design, with the squircle camera island placed at the top left of the rear.

The information comes from Ming-Chi Kuo, a goldmine of supply chain information who usually focuses on Apple. Speaking of which, it's not coincidental that he's talking about this form factor, as Apple itself has been rumored to be working on a similar device too.
