    "description": "Last week Nothing was rumored to be working on three new smartphones, and one of them was spotted on Geekbench and said to be the Nothing Phone (3). That's not the case. The device in question, with the model number A059, is most likely the Nothing Phone (3a), since it's been spotted in an IMEI database alongside an A059P - the \"P\" stands for \"plus\" in Nothing's nomenclature, so that one will be the Nothing Phone (3a) Plus.

The news comes after Apple proposed investments of $100 million and $10 million last month after initially committing IDR 1.71 trillion ($109 million) in local R\u0026D facilities.
