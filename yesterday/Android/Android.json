    "description": "Huawei launched the Pura 70 Ultra back in April, and the company is now obviously working on its successor. The Pura 80 Ultra's camera specs have been leaked in China today. It's said to come with a 50 MP main camera with a 1-inch type sensor and variable aperture, a 50 MP ultrawide, and a \"super large\" periscope zoom camera with a 1/1.3\" type sensor. Huawei Pura 70 Ultra As we're still quite far off from the Pura 80 Ultra's unveiling (rumored for Q2 2025, presumably April being the most likely month given its predecessor's launch time), do keep in mind that these rumored specs are...",

    "description": "vivo's upcoming Y39 has allegedly been spotted on Geekbench. It managed a 912 single-core score and a 2,214 multi-core score in Geekbench 6.3.0, so clearly this won't be a high-end device. And indeed it seems to be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 chipset, which is a lower-tier SoC. The phone does support 5G, and the tested prototype had 8GB of RAM. There may be other RAM options available upon launch. The Y39 will run Android 15 from day one, and it could be branded Jovi in Brazil thanks to a trademark dispute with Telefonica Brazil which owns the name Vivo over...",
