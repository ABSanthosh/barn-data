    "description": "Samsung's Galaxy Watch8 series is likely to arrive in a squircle body shape, similar to that of the Galaxy Watch Ultra released last year. The Galaxy Watch8 will come in two sizes, while the Watch8 Classic, which is expected to bring back the rotating bezel, will only be available in one single size. This information comes from a deep dive inside the One UI 8 Watch firmware for the Galaxy Watch8 Classic.
