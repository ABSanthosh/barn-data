    "description": "Yesterday was a big day for Motorola, as it announced the Edge 60, Edge 60 Pro, Razr 60, and Razr 60 Ultra. The Edge 60 Pro is also headed to India, the brand has now revealed, and it will have its launch over there on April 30. The phone will be sold through Flipkart, Motorola's online store, as well as \"leading retail stores\", whatever that means.

    "description": "Last week we asked you whether your phone has received the Android 15 update yet. Many already have, which is encouraging to see, but it’s not all rosy. Over 40% of people who responded to our poll have Android 15 running on their phone – or rather the manufacturer’s implementation of Android 15. Around a third of voters are still waiting, even though the first updates started rolling out since October (that was for the Pixels, of course). Worryingly, 20% – one in every five voters – do not have a phone eligible for v15. Extended software support windows are a relatively new trend...",
