    "description": "The OnePlus Watch 2 was announced back in February, followed by the cheaper but almost identical OnePlus Watch 2R during the summer. Now, the company is working on the OnePlus Watch 3, and it's already passed through the FCC. The certification has revealed the fact that the next OnePlus wearable has a huge 648 mAh battery, which is 29.6% larger than the OnePlus Watch 2's 500 mAh cell.

    "description": "Xiaomi's 15 Ultra has now been certified in China by 3C, and this is an interesting time for that to happen since the 14 Ultra only passed through 3C in early February ahead of its late February unveiling this year. So with that in mind, it seems entirely plausible that the 15 Ultra would get official, at least for the Chinese market, in the next few weeks. The certification has revealed the phone's support for 90W wired charging, as well as satellite connectivity - do however keep in mind this is the Chinese model, and that feature may not make it to international markets.
