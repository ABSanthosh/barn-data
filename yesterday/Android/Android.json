    "description": "Earlier today the US Supreme Court upheld the law that will ban TikTok in the US unless it sells by January 19.

The GT 7 Pro launched in November and now it looks like its lesser sibling could be ready to join it soon. The certification reveals that the GT 7 has support for 120W wired charging as well as support for 5G. Neither of those things is surprising given the GT line's positioning in Realme's portfolio as the flagship series, but it's good to have confirmation nevertheless. A previous TENAA certification revealed that the GT 7 will...",
