The Galaxy S25 Slim, which is expected to replace the FE next year, will feature a 200MP main camera (but a smaller 1/1.56-inch sensor than the S24 Ultra's 1/1.3-inch), and a pair of 1/2.76-inch ISOCELL HP5s for the 3.5x zoom and ultrawide. A word on the Galaxy S25 Ultra - its bill of materials (BoM) is \"at least\" $110 over that of the S24 Ultra, so expect it to feature some nicer components, but also cost more. We also saw dummies of the upcoming S25 Ultra, featuring slightly more rounded corners. More on Samsung - the Galaxy A series will finally get 45W charging! Huawei announced pre-orders for the Mate 70 series ahead of the series' official unveil on November 26. The series will consist of Mate 70, Mate 70 Pro, and Mate 70 Pro+ phones, according to Vmall. The Huawei-owned online store also revealed there will be five different memory variants and eight colors split between the three devices. Finally, we have the Galaxy A16 4G in for review and the iPhone SE 4 is expected in March.",
