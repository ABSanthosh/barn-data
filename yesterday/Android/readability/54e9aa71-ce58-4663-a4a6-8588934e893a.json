  "text": "Qualcomm recently announced that it’s entered into a multi-year partnership with Google towards automotive computing efforts, which will see integrations between Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Digital Chassis portfolio, Android Automotive OS and Google Cloud. The two companies want to use this partnership to develop a standardized reference platform for future in-vehicle solutions, which in turn will rely on generative AI courtesy of Google. If all this sounds like tech mumbo-jumbo to you, it’s essentially Qualcomm and Google working on making future cars smarter with features like AI voice assistants, improved map navigation, and even real-time updates to trips and routes, to name a few. READ: Qualcomm Focuses on Automotive Features with its Snapdragon Ride and Cockpit Elite Platforms It’s a team-up that isn’t too surprising, especially given the continued rise of electric vehicles and AI-based software solutions. Patrick Brady, VP of Engineering at Google states: The automotive industry is on the cusp of major transformation enabled by advancements in generative AI, automated driving solutions, and the ability to update software features throughout the platform’s lifecycle… We look forward to extending our longstanding relationship with Qualcomm Technologies with this strategic collaboration to continue developing innovative solutions for software defined vehicles, and to showcase the power of co-innovation in propelling the future of transportation.
