The selfie camera will be a 32MP unit, while the rear camera will have three modules with a 50MP main (there are no details on the other two). Realme 14T The phone will be powered by a 5,080mAh battery with 100W SuperVOOC charging. And it will be rated IP68 and IP69K, which we have been seeing on more and more Realme phones recently. Leakster @ZionsAnvin shares additional images of the phone and offers alternative specs (the store page might just be a placeholder, which won't be 100% accurate). The Realme 14T will allegedly have a 6.67\" 120Hz OLED display with 1080p+ resolution and will be powered by the Dimensity 6300, which was also featured on the Realme 13 and others. The phone will come with 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 128GB or 256GB of UFS 2.2 storage. According to Anvin, the battery will have 6,000mAh capacity and will charge at 45W instead of the 5,080mAh/100W spec listed by the store. Anyway, the phone reportedly measures 163.1 x 75.6 x 7.9mm and weighs 196g. The camera setup will be 50MP (OmniVision OV50D) plus a 2MP helper on the back and a 16MP on the front (Sony IMX480). This too differs from the store specs. The store says “see you in April”, so the official reveal of the Realme 14T is a few weeks out. Source 1 | Source 2 (now deleted) | Source 3",
