  "text": "Case Material Polymer and steel; polymer and titanium Case size 42mm, 47mm, 51mm Colors Silver, Gray, Gold, Black Display AMOLED Storage 16 GB; 32 GB The Epix Pro is a versatile smartwatch that offers a range of tracking features, as well as advanced health monitoring capabilities. Grab it now for its best price yet at $665. Prime Day is just around the corner, but we're already seeing some impressive deals on some of our favorite tech, like this steep discount on the Garmin Epix Pro (Gen 2) Sapphire Edition. This is one of Garmin's top-rated watches that features pretty much everything you'd need to track your health and wellness metrics. Furthermore, it also offers tools to keep you on track with any fitness goals. With that said, you can now score this robust smartwatch for its best price as it drops to just $665. While that price isn't cheap, it is the lowest price we've seen for this watch since its release. You can now save $435 if you act quickly. What's great about the Garmin Epix Pro (Gen 2) Sapphire Edition? We really loved this watch when we reviewed it, praising it for having a beautiful display, great health and fitness tracking features, along with a rugged and durable design. This particular model that's on sale is the 51mm model, which also features a sapphire screen for additional protection. When it comes to the details, this model has a 1.4-inch screen and also features a titanium case. You get watch straps that are easy to change, along with an integrated LED flashlight that can make it easy to find things you're looking for when conditions aren't the best. Perhaps most impressive is that you get up to 31 days of battery life on a single charge. As stated before, you get health and fitness tracking, along with the ability to monitor your sleep quality and stress levels. There's also location tracking as well. So no matter where you are, you'll always be able to get to your location with ease thanks to the watch's Multi-Band GPS. And since this is a smartwatch, you're also going to get notifications on your wrist, and the ability to pay at supported terminals with Garmin Pay. For the most part, this is going to be one of the most complete smartwatches for fitness on the market. Of course, if you're not really feeling this watch, and want to check out some other options, we have some other great ones to recommend.",
