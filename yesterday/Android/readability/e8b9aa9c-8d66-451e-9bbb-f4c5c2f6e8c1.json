  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Gemini showing up in Google Drive has overhauled how we deal with long, messy PDFs. Being able to pull quick summaries or key takeaways straight from the side panel has been a total time-saver. That said, Drive's Gemini-powered PDF summary capabilities are restricted to the web version at present. But signs are pointing to these smart features making their way to Android soon. Related 5 ways to use Gemini in Gmail and Google Drive Essential Gemini tricks for smarter email and file management Earlier this month, Google gave its Gemini integration in Drive a welcome upgrade, allowing you to get instant summaries of PDFs right from the web, saving you from scrolling through every page. While this time-saving magic has been web-only, it looks like Android users won’t be left out for long, as per Android Authority. Gemini’s PDF smarts are likely headed to mobile soon, making it way easier to skim through docs while you’re on the move. Spotted in Google Drive v2.25.250 for Android, a new “Summarize this file” option is apparently in the works. Once it's live for everyone, you can tap the three-dot menu or hit the Gemini icon up top, and you’ll be able to get quick takeaways. With this change, you’ll be able to summon Gemini summaries for any PDF, whether it’s your own or shared, right inside the Google Drive app on Android. This eliminates the need to bounce out of the viewer to get a recap. A sneak peek at the next big shift in how we handle docs This is a big step toward smarter, more proactive AI help. Instead of waiting for you to ask, Gemini will soon surface key information from your PDFs upfront. While Android doesn’t automatically show summaries like the web (yet), you’ll still be able to tap and get the gist whenever you need it. However, if you’re viewing a downloaded PDF offline in Drive, this new summary feature probably won’t kick in. To get those recaps, make sure your PDFs stay stored in Google Drive, so Gemini can do its tricks. On top of summarizing single PDFs, this new feature in Drive might also let you condense multiple files or even whole folders in one go. According to Android Authority, you’ll likely be able to pick a folder for summarization (though probably just one at a time). If that holds up, it’s a big win for keeping tons of documents under control without the usual hassle.",

integration in Drive a welcome upgrade, allowing you to get instant summaries of PDFs right from the web, saving you from scrolling through every page. While this time-saving magic has been web-only, it looks like Android users won’t be left out for long, as per \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-drive-summarize-multiple-pdf-docs-apk-teardown-3571668/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAndroid Authority\u003c/a\u003e. Gemini’s PDF smarts are likely headed to mobile soon, making it way easier to skim through docs while you’re on the move.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eSpotted in Google Drive v2.25.250 for Android, a new “Summarize this file” option is apparently in the works. Once it\u0026#39;s live for everyone, you can tap the three-dot menu or hit the Gemini icon up top, and you’ll be able to get quick takeaways.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n    \n\u003cp\u003eWith this change, you’ll be able to summon Gemini summaries for any PDF, whether it’s your own or shared, right inside the Google Drive app on Android. This eliminates the need to bounce out of the viewer to get a recap.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"a-sneak-peek-at-the-next-big-shift-in-how-we-handle-docs\"\u003e\n                        A sneak peek at the next big shift in how we handle docs\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is a big step toward smarter, more proactive AI help. Instead of waiting for you to ask, Gemini will soon surface key information from your PDFs upfront. While Android doesn’t automatically show summaries like the web (yet), you’ll still be able to tap and get the gist whenever you need it.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eHowever, if you’re viewing a downloaded PDF offline in Drive, this new summary feature probably won’t kick in. To get those recaps, make sure your PDFs stay stored in Google Drive, so Gemini can do its tricks.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                \n    \n\u003cp\u003eOn top of summarizing single PDFs, this new feature in Drive might also let you condense multiple files or even whole folders in one go. According to Android Authority, you’ll likely be able to pick a folder for summarization (though probably just one at a time). If that holds up, it’s a big win for keeping tons of documents under control without the usual hassle.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n    \n\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
