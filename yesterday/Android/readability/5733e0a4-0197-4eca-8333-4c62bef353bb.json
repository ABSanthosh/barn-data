Google has clearly made battery stability a top priority in its Pixel software updates this year, and for good reason. The company has had a long, bumpy history with power-related issues that pushed many users to their limits. Take the Pixel 7a, for instance. There were confirmed cases of battery swelling, even when the phones weren’t heavily used. Google quietly adjusted firmware updates to mitigate the risk and tweaked how the system handles background power loads. Then there was the Pixel 4a incident where users complained about rapid battery drain and device shutdowns. It was so much that Google ended up pulling certain Android updates from its servers to stop users from reverting to unstable versions. The company is currently nerfing the Pixel 6a's battery with a new update that should supposedly save it in the future.  Why your Pixel phone might start charging slower In a recent post shared by Mishaal Rahman on X, Google confirmed a serious battery issue affecting some Pixel 6a phones. Months ago, they were catching fire. Now, the company said that it will send out a mandatory software update to help stop the battery from getting too hot. This update will turn on after the phone has been charged through 400 cycles, slowing down how fast it charges and how much power it can hold to keep the battery safe. A subset of Pixel 6a phones will require a mandatory software update to reduce the risk of potential battery overheating. The update will enable battery management features that will reduce capacity and charging performance after the battery reaches 400 charge cycles. We’ll contact impacted customers next month, with all the information they need to address the issue. Google Spokesperson's statement to Android Authority. Image: u/Zaliver on Reddit Typically, a charge cycle means using up 100% of your battery’s capacity, not necessarily in one go. For example, if you use 50% today and charge it back, then use another 50% tomorrow and charge again, that counts as one full cycle. Image: Google Once you hit 400 cycles, the update will slow down how fast your phone charges to prevent it from heating up. If your phone used to charge from 0 to 100% in 90 minutes, it might take longer after the update. The phone will also stop charging to 100% all the time. It might cap the battery at 80%.  Related: Is Your Google Pixel 7a Battery Swelling? Get It Fixed for Free Pixel owners deserve more than software promises Google's latest battery control system for the Pixel 6a mirrors the Battery Health Assistance feature they introduced on the Pixel 9a. It's built directly into the system as a long-term safeguard and you can't disable it. Once the battery starts aging, the Pixel 9a will automatically reduce the maximum voltage sent to the battery and slow down charging speeds.  Image: r/pixel7series on Reddit It’s becoming harder to reconcile Google’s promise of long-term software support with the actual lifespan of its hardware, especially in the Pixel A-series. Google advertises up to eight years of OS updates and security patches, but your phone’s battery is more likely to start swelling or overheating within two years. Google's ambitions are commendable, but they need to address the disconnect between software longevity and hardware durability with the same urgency they bring to AI features.
