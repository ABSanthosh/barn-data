Google Pixel 9 Pro XLThe Pixel 10 handsets will be powered by Google's Tensor G5 chipset, the first one in the line that will be manufactured by TSMC and not Samsung. That, rumors say, will come with a modem switch from Samsung's Exynos Modem to a MediaTek modem, as well as (hopefully) better performance and thermals. Despite the modem switch, the Pixel 10 family is still expected to retain support for satellite connectivity, according to a recent report. Since Google plans on releasing Android 16 this month, it's a given that the Pixel 10s will be running this version out of the box. They might also come with a higher PWM dimming rate for their screens. Source",
