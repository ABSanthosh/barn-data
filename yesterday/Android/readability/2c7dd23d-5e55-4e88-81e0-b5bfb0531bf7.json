READ: How to use Apple AirPods Pro 2 as hearing aids At least that’s what the numbers show – recent data from research firm Counterpoint Research indicates that the iPhone 15 currently sits as the world’s best-selling smartphone for Q3 2024, even outselling the newer iPhone 16. Trailing behind it are the iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPhone 15 Pro, followed by a number of budget Android phones from Samsung. Surprisingly, the Samsung Galaxy S24 managed to sneak into 10th place, trailing just behind the Redmi 10C. This makes it the first S-series model in a while to climb into the Q3 top ten – the last time this happened was back in 2018. The iPhone 15 was launched last year, and while Apple has promised several years of software support for the device it does lack some features found on the newer iPhone 16 models, such as the camera control button, as well as support for Apple intelligence.
