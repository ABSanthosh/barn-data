With that in mind, users who are looking to upgrade their home security system might want to take advantage of this deal on Google’s outdoor Nest Cam. Currently on sale via Amazon, the Nest Cam is going for less than $130 and packs some pretty useful features at a much lower price than usual. The camera comes with intelligent surveillance that allows it to differentiate between people, animals, and vehicles, sending alerts directly to the Google Home app. It also features 1080p HDR video with night vision for clear 24/7 monitoring from any location, and users can review up to 3 hours of event video history for free, with the option to extend this to 60 days through a separate Nest Aware subscription. The Nest Cam also works with Google Assistant for hands-free live streaming on compatible smart displays, and works with both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity.
