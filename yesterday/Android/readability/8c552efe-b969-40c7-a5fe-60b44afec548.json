More info. The pre-order period is over for Samsung’s Galaxy S25 lineup, but that doesn’t mean the deals have stopped. If you missed out on that initial $50 reservation credit, no worries, there are still many savings to be had. Order Galaxy S25, Save Up to $1140 Buyers of the Galaxy S25 are still eligible for free doubled storage (512GB for price of 256GB, 1TB for price of 512GB), as well as enhanced trade-in values. For example, buyers of a Galaxy S25 Ultra can get up to $900 off when trading in a select device. That $900 off gets you the brand new S25 Ultra (512GB) for just $399. That’s not bad at all. If you want the smaller Galaxy S25 in one of its amazing color options (Coralred or Navy), the price can be as low as $299 thanks to a combination of instant credits and trade-in discounts. And yes, if you’r eligible for Samsung Offer Programs, there are even more savings to be had. Follow the link below to snag your Galaxy S25. Samsung Link",
