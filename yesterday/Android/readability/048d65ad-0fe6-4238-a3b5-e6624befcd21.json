Interestingly, this means India will have gotten two Redmi Note generations this year, as the Redmi Note 13 devices also launched in 2024. That isn't going to be a fluke, as Indian execs have revealed that this line will continue to get updates twice each year, which used to be the case before the COVID-19 pandemic. Then it got slowed to once a year, but now things are back in full swing with \"improved efficiency and manufacturing alignment\". The Xiaomi 15 will reach India in March, and the Redmi A4 will get a full launch later this month as a very cheap 5G smartphone. Source",
