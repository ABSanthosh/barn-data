The Apple iPad mini (2024) now has 128GB storage in its base configuration and 8GB of RAM. The latter is paired with a downgraded A17 Pro chipset to support Apple Intelligence. These AI features will arrive soon as part of the iPadOS 18.1 update (and will initially be limited to the US). There are some other upgrades over the old mini, like faster Wi-Fi 6E and USB-C connectivity (10Gbps, up from 5Gbps). But you’re still getting an 8.3” 60Hz IPS LCD, even though this chip ran the 120Hz display on the iPhone 15 Pro just fine. The old iPad mini (2021) is still available and it is cheaper. The base storage of 64GB is hard to recommend as it will get quite tight between iPadOS and app updates, never mind storing files. You could look at the 256GB model, but at that price you may as well get the 2024 tablet instead. Apple Intelligence is available on devices with Apple A Pro chipsets as well as M-series chips – like the new iPad Pros, for example. These are still the only devices with the Apple M4 chip and the performance gain over the old M2-based iPad Pros is massive. We’ve linked the 256GB (also available with 512GB storage) and 1TB (and 2TB) versions of the iPad Pro (2024) and they are different. The smaller capacity models have 8GB of RAM and 9-core CPUs, while the higher capacity models have 16GB of RAM and 10-core CPUs. Only the higher capacity tablets have the option of nano-textured glass, but keep in mind that it is a pricey upgrade. Moving on from tablets, the new Apple AirPods 4 also come in two variants – without ANC and with ANC. Active Noise Cancellation costs extra, but you’ll appreciate its benefits when traveling or working in a noisy office. The ANC-enabled model also features wireless charging (you can use your Apple Watch charger or MagSafe charger) and a small speaker helps you find the case. The Apple Watch Series 10 is thinner and lighter than previous models while also having the largest display on any Apple smartwatch. It’s kind of a mini-Ultra with a depth gauge that can track your dives down to 20ft (and there is a water temperature sensor too). Apple also upgraded the speaker, allowing you to listen to music or a podcast straight from your watch, no headphones needed. You can still pick up the older Apple Watch Series 9. It got the sleep apnea tracking feature as an update with watchOS 11. It has an ECG sensor and heart rate tracking, but keep in mind that Series 9 and 10 watches (and the Ultra 2) have their blood-oxygen sensor disabled in the US. Finally, the 2023 Apple Mac mini has a nice discount with the help of a coupon. This is powered by the Apple M2 chip (there’s a pricier version with the M2 Pro available as well) and has two Thunderbolt ports, an HDMI port, gigabit Ethernet and Wi-Fi 6E compatibility. It’s not fanless but it is whisper quiet. macOS is also getting a dose of Apple Intelligence. We may get a commission from qualifying sales.",
