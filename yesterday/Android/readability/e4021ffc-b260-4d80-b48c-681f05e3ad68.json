Previously, it was thought that only the Pro Max would get that amount, but Apple has apparently reconsidered. As for the 'vanilla' iPhone 17, Apple reportedly wants to give it 12GB of RAM, but \"potential supply shortages remain a concern\". The company is said to be finalizing its assessment on the matter and will reach a decision next month. Even if the iPhone 17 will only get 8GB, all members of the iPhone 18 family are now rumored to have 12GB. Kuo says Apple's move to put more RAM into its iPhones stems from \"intensifying competition in the smartphone market\". Source 1 | Source 2",
