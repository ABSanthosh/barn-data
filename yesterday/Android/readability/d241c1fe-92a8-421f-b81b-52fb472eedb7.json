During the latest Samsung Developer Conference, the company unveiled its successor, called Gauss2, which brings improved performance and efficiency. Samsung truly believes that AI can enhance productivity and it has been using the Gauss AI internally. It is used in “code.i”, an in-house tool for developers in the Device eXperience (DX) division. Usage of code.i has been growing at a fast pace and now 60% of all developers inside DX are using it. code.i in action Gauss has also been deployed to Samsung call centers where it summarizes and categorizes calls. Another application is the Samsung Gauss Portal, a conversational AI that helps employees in the DX division. Samsung has definitely been practicing what it preaches when it comes to AI. So, what is Gauss2 and how is it better than the old one (and other AI models)? There are actually three models: Compact, Balanced and Supreme. Compact is the smallest model and is optimized for on-device operation. Balanced is bigger and performs better on tasks, but it’s a balance between performance, generation speed and efficiency (hence the name). Supreme is built on top of Balanced and uses the Mixture of Experts approach – instead of having a single model, multiple models are used, each focused on different kinds of problems. There are three Gauss2 models: Compact, Balanced and SupremeDepending on which model is used, Gauss2 supports 9 to 14 human languages and several programming languages. Samsung says that Balanced and Supreme match or beat other AI models on tasks in English and Korean. Even better, “their processing speed per hour is 1.5 to 3 times faster”, which reduces costs and wait times for services powered by the AI model. Samsung is forging on with its “AI for All” plan and says that it will “continue to expand the reach of its AI-based services across all product lines so that users can experience more convenient and enjoyable daily lives. And by integrating knowledge graph technology with AI, Samsung expects to provide even more enhanced personalization services”. Source",
