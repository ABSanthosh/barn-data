It supports up to 65W wired and 15W wireless charging (Qi 1.3). The Zenfone 12 Ultra launched in Europe, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, priced at €1,100. The ROG Phone 9 FE is the first FE model in the series and it brings yesterday's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC. The phone was quietly launched by the brand in Thailand, where it's available to purchase for THB 29,990. On to the Xiaomi 15 Ultra. Rumor has it, that the phone will be unveiled on February 26. We saw the phone in a hands-on video and a photo in the wild. Camera-wise, the 15 Ultra will feature a 1-inch type main camera using the Lytia LYT-900 sensor, a 200MP periscope telephoto (ISOCELL HP9), a 50 MP short-range telephoto (IMX858), and a 50 MP ultrawide (ISOCELL JN5). Its battery is slated as a 6,000mAh unit with 90W charging. Apple unveiled a new app, called Invites. It's an app about creating and managing event invites - pretty simple - but it did make the headlines. Samsung dropped the Galaxy S25 and S25 Ultra Enterprise Editions with a free year of Samsung Knox Suite and three years of enhanced business support.",
