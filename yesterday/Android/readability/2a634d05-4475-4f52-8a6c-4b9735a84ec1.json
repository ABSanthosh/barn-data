For one, users can now include words to their visual query to search with images and text simultaneously, allowing users to perform more specialized searches. For example, users can ask a question with a specific color or visual attribute in mind with better and more relevant results. READ: Chrome just got updated with new performance controls Folks can now free up storage space on their phones by saving content from the web to Drive and Photos directly from Chrome. To add a file, users will need to tap on the Google Drive option when saving their files, which will appear in a folder called “saved from Chrome.” Alternatively, images can also be saved to the Google Photos app instead via a long press. For folks in the United States, Chrome (for select products) will present users with a new “Shopping Insights” feature that finds deals, and shows relevant details such as price history, price tracking and other purchase options. Google adds that this feature will arrive for more regions in the coming months. Finally, users will soon be able to view a mini-map of the location directly in Chrome simply by tapping on an underlined address on their screen. Google does state that it’s still working on the feature, although it will launch it globally over the coming months.
