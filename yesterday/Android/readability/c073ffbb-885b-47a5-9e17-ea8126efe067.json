READ: Google Sneakily Adds in UI Changes to Android Auto This includes streaming services, interactive software and games, and more. Part of Google’s official statement reads: Starting this week, cars with Google built-in will get dozens of new apps to enjoy while parked. This launch is part of our car ready mobile apps program, which we introduced last year to make it easier for developers to distribute their large-screen-optimized mobile apps to car screens. Whether you’re waiting at a charging station or in line at school pickup, you’ll be able to stay entertained with popular streaming and gaming apps like Farm Heroes Saga and F1 TV… Google hasn’t specified all the car models that will receive this update, although the launch will be initially available for select cars from Polestar and Volvo, with more to follow soon.
