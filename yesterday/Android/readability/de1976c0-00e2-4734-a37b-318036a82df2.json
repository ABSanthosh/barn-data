But the reality is that it can be an important piece to upgrade if you're looking to get the best visual experience possible. As you might expect, there are plenty of great gaming monitors out there, but we think Samsung delivers some of the best options. Related 7 most important features you should consider when buying a new monitor Monitor spec sheets are full of buzzwords and other filler, but these are the things you should pay attention to. This is especially the case right now, as the brand has some of its best gaming monitors on sale. If you've been thinking about upgrading, we think it's worth taking a look. Not only can you score hundreds off the brand's fantastic OLED models, but it also has some heavy discounts on its massive 55-inch Odyssey Ark, and the 57-inch Odyssey Neo G9 as well.

In addition to its massive 49-inch screen, you get a 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time.
