  "text": "The phone launches just never stop – following a ton of product reveals from various phone manufacturers throughout the entirety of January (including Samsung’s grand reveal of the Galaxy S25 series), it’s now ASUS’ turn to unveil its upcoming flagship device, the Zenfone 12 Ultra. READ: The ASUS ROG Phone 9 FE could be launching soon While ASUS’ ROG series phones have always featured bleeding-edge hardware, its Zenfone line has likewise maintained its flagship status despite shaving off a bit of extra weight and gaming-centric features. With that said, ASUS posted an official teaser for the Zenfone 12 Ultra’s launch, which is scheduled to arrive next week. Unsurprisingly, ASUS hasn’t revealed much about the Zenfone 12 Ultra, although it’s expected that it will feature the same design as the ROG Phone 9, similar to what it did with last year’s Zenfone 11 series. We can probably expect it to feature the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, which is the go-to SoC for most flagship Android phones for 2025. ASUS will hold its launch event on February 6.",
