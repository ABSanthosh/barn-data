New Time to Walk episodes feature Adam Scott, Rita Ora, Daddy Yankee, and Tiffany Haddish, while Alex Wong leads an exclusive dance workout takeover. Perhaps the biggest news is that Fitness+ is now collaborating with Strava, in such a way that when you share a Fitness+ workout to Strava, the Strava app will now display rich details like the episode image, episode number, music genre, trainer name, and metrics. New and existing Strava subscribers can even redeem up to three months of Fitness+ for free. Apple Fitness+ is $9.99 per month or $79.99 per year and can be shared with up to five other family members. It's also included in the Apple One Premier plan. Fitness+ is only available in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, the UAE, the UK, and the US. The new features will be available on January 6 on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. On Apple Watch you get an extra \"layer of motivation\", Apple says, with real-time metrics to track your progress.
