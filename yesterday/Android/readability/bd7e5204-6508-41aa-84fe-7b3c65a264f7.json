The news comes alongside the streaming giant’s quarterly earning numbers, where they reported record subscription adds, a 16% growth in revenue for the year, and operating income that exceeded $10B for the first time in their history. Again, Netflix set a whole bunch of records this past year and quarter and are now raising prices on you. The new prices look as follows and are already live today: Standard with ads: $7.99/mo (up from $6.99) Standard without ads: $17.99/mo (up from $15.49) Premium: $24.99/mo (up from $22.99) The last Netflix price increase came in October 2023, so I guess we were due to see them go up again? I say that as a question because we’re so used to streaming companies increasing prices that I actually can’t believe it has been more than a year since they last did it. // Netflix",
