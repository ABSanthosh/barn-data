READ: Check Out these Slim Cases for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra! With that said, we’re taking a closer look at the Incase A.R.C. Commuter Pack. A 26L backpack, I recently had the opportunity to use it on a short trip, and it certainly proved to a be a nice addition to my EDC setup, which usually consists of essentials such as headphones, a tablet and charging equipment, and in this particular case some clothing as well. The A.R.C. Commuter Pack is available in a handful of different colors, and we have the black version here which offers a sleek and minimalist aesthetic. Immediately, you’ll notice the abundance of storage options both inside and out, and the design strikes a good balance between functionality and style, avoiding the overly busy look of some heavily compartmentalized backpacks. The exterior is constructed from recycled polyester, with a rubberized material at the top for added water resistance. While this feature is welcome, it would be beneficial to see it extended to more areas on the front of the pack, although this is a minor gripe. On the sides you’ll find water bottle pockets which can also double as convenient storage for items like phones or wallets, offering quick access. A zippered compartment behind the main body provides space for larger tablets, such as the Galaxy Tab Ultra or iPad Pro models, catering to users who carry multiple devices. This should prove useful for content creators or mobile professionals who require a comprehensive gear setup with multiple items in addition to their laptops and tablets, for example. The top handle likewise feels robust and durable with a slight elasticity, and it does feel like it can withstand daily wear and tear. The main compartment features a clamshell-style zipper opening, allowing for wide access to a pretty spacious interior. On the inside you’ll find dedicated slots for a tablet or laptop, along with organized compartments on the top and bottom for items like chargers, cables, and other tech accessories. There’s also a cleverly-hidden magnetic pouch behind the top handle that offers quick access to essentials like wallets, phones, or passports, which is useful when traveling. The backpack’s numerous compartments are undeniably practical for tech-heavy users and those who need to carry clothing. During my trip, I was able to comfortably fit several articles of clothing. The pack remains comfortable even when fully loaded, with straps that don’t feel restrictive even when I wore the backpack all day long. One critique however is the non-removable chest strap, which I don’t use regularly and would prefer to have the option to remove or hide. READ: Best iPhone 16e cases The Incase A.R.C. Commuter Pack is priced at the higher end of the market, although I do think that the quality of materials, versatile storage options, and overall comfort justify the investment. It’s a well-designed backpack for individuals who need to carry a significant amount of tech or personal items for daily use or travel, and it definitely gets a lot of things right.
