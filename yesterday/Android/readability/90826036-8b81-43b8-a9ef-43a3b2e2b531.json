We could probably argue for hours on what the most anticipated smartphone series of each year is, but I think we'd get quite a lot of people arguing in favor of Samsung's S series. Rightfully so. That lineup has been the de facto representative of the Android platform for the last several years. In just about a month, we're going to get our first chance to see the Samsung Galaxy S25+ and the other smartphones in the series. However, the middle child is giving us an early look, thanks to a tipster over on X. Let me spoil things for you: if you've seen the S24+, you've seen the S25+. The Samsung Galaxy S25+ Has Leaked, Showing A Very Familiar Design Image: Jukanlosreve on X The Samsung Galaxy S25+ is in the middle of the three-device S lineup that we see every year. If the rhythm of previous Plus models means something for the upcoming device, it will bring a bigger screen, a bigger battery, faster charging, and more RAM than the vanilla model in the series. We know that the phone generally won't be bringing much to the table in terms of internal hardware, but what about the design? Thanks to Jukanlosreve on X, we have an answer to that, though we sort of knew it anyway. The tipster brings real images of the Samsung Galaxy S25+, giving us our first very clear look at the device. However, the very disappointing part is that essentially nothing changes and it'll probably be incredibly easy to mistake this for the Galaxy S24+. Image: Jukanlosreve on X We see the same flat back with three vertically aligned cameras in the upper-left corner. There were some whispers that the device was going to switch to the concentric rim around each camera like the Z Fold 6, but nope—it's the same old. The flat display and flat frame stick around, though the bezels seem to get a little thinner and we can spot the mmWave antenna under the power button. I Desperately Need Samsung To Excite Me, And Soon Image: Jukanlosreve on X Samsung has been sticking to the “if it ain't broke, don't fix it” dogma, and I sort of see why. They've achieved what might be the perfect minimal design for a smartphone and they don't seem to be in any rush to try something risky with a design change. However, my last phone was a Samsung and so is my current one, but with the way things are looking, the bloodline is going to end there. If the Galaxy S26 sticks to the same design language (and middling specs in some departments), I'm just going to have to pitch my tent elsewhere. Even If The S25 Series Doesn't Excite You, It Will Bring The Launch Of One UI 7 Image: Samsung Samsung fans haven't been eating good, especially when it comes to the release of the Android 15-based One UI 7. While most major OEMs are already releasing stable versions of their new operating systems, Samsung is still playing with betas. However, we know for a fact that the launch of the Galaxy S25 lineup in late January (rumored to be January 22nd) will bring One UI 7 for good. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
