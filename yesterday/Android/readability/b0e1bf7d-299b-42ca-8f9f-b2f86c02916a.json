  "text": "The OnePlus 12 launched earlier this year. If you skipped this model and are waiting for the OnePlus 13, you’ll be pleased to learn that we finally have an official date for the phone’s launch. OnePlus has announced that the OnePlus 13 will be launching on the 7th of January, 2025. What’s interesting is the fact that the OnePlus 13 has already launched. The handset was revealed back in November, but at that time it was only available for China. This announcement by OnePlus suggests that the handset will be making its way to global markets, which is good news for our readers outside of China. The company hasn’t mentioned anything about its availability or how much it could cost, but we expect those details to be shared during the event. As for hardware, we imagine that OnePlus won’t be changing much, or anything at all, from the China variant. This means that we can expect to see the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset coupled with 12GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. It will also feature a massive 2.5D display with an adaptive refresh rate of 1-120Hz, and a brightness that tops out at 4,500 nits. The handset is accompanied by a trio of 50MP Hasselblad cameras on the back. This includes a 23mm camera, a 3x periscope, and a 15mm ultrawide. Lastly, we can expect the global version of the OnePlus 13 to pack a 6,000mAh battery with 100W wired and 50W wireless charging. A graphic novelist wannabe. Amateur chef.
