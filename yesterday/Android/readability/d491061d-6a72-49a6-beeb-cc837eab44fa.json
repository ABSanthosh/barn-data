With that being said, buyers looking for a more lightweight option might want to try out the WF-1000XM5 Earbuds, which are on sale on Amazon right now. In terms of features, you’re getting up to 8 hours (24-hours with case) battery life, AI based noise reduction algorithm and bone conduction sensor for clear calls, active noise cancellation, and a bit of water resistance making them safe for use in workouts and light rain. They also come with a pretty lightweight design, and support touch controls for easy use – you can check the earbuds using the link below.
