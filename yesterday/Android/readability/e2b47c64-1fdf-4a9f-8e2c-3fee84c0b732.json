This video is based on unconfirmed info, but offers potential answers to some burning questions. For example, what’s with that weird square shape? The additional internal volume could help the drivers “breathe” better – this would improve sound quality and ANC. Speaking of sound quality, Nothing struck up a partnership with KEF earlier this year – KEF is a British company that builds high-end audio products and has agreed to tune the Headphones (1) (and other Nothing products). Anyway, the headband doesn’t fold, but the ear cups can be rotated 90° to lie flat. There is an assortment of buttons and sliders to control volume and playback. You can see a USB-C cable plugged into the headphones, a 3.5mm plug is a possibility. Nothing Headphones (1) (leaked images)In terms of price, the Nothing Headphones (1) will be $300 in the US (yes, these are coming to the US and Canada) and €300/£300 in Europe. Via 1 | Via 2",
