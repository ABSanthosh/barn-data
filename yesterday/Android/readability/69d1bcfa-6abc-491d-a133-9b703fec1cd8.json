The announcement first took place in China, followed by an international launch just a fortnight later. They were overshadowed by the Mate X6's global reveal (review here) and the nova 13 series debut, but we believe they deserve attention so we took a pair for a test. So here's what we found out. Table of Contents: Design User Interface Sound Charging Battery life Verdict Design and build quality The buds and case of Freebuds Pro 4 closely resemble those of Freebuds Pro 3 externally. Our model is Black, featuring golden trim around the stem and case, along with a graphic element on the stem that announces the Histen technology. Green and White variants are also available, both adorned with golden accents. Those are bound to be well received in Asian markets, though we have our doubts if Westerners will agree. The touch sensor is positioned on the inner side of the stem and becomes easy to use once you become accustomed to the pinching and swiping gestures. All gestures can be customized through the AI Life app, which we recommend downloading and installing from Huawei AppGallery as it has the latest version. User interface The buds were promoted in China as the first audio wearables featuring HarmonyOS 5.0; however, that claim is missing from the global version. One reason for this change is that Huawei prefers not to promote the Harmony OS too heavily at this time, and another is that this feature holds little significance in the earphone market. The app offers various noise control options. Awareness mode features two settings: Voice Mode, which can be switched on or off; activating this option enhances the earbuds’ ability to pick up voices. Additionally, there’s Off Mode and Noise Cancelling, which includes four distinct settings: Dynamic, Cozy, General, and Ultra, each tailored for specific environments. Detailed control of Awareness and Noise Cancelling is available only in the app, meaning it takes some time to choose your preferred option. There is also an Equalizer with some presets, but you can create one of your own as well. FreeBuds Pro 4 can prioritize sound quality or connection. The higher bitrate sound comes with a shorter battery life too. There is an option that uses sound to map your ear and determine whether the rubber tips are the proper size. However, the feature indicated that all three sizes (Small, Medium, Large) are good enough, so aren't really convinced of its usefulness. Comfort is a key factor with such compact buds. Extended use did not lead to any discomfort – you hardly feel the Freebuds in your ears. We tested them in the gym and during lengthy runs. The outcome is that the buds remain in place as long as there isn't any abrupt movement. There was the occasional issue with one bud slightly slipping out, but this was mainly due to our resident earbuds reviewer having subpar running form, which caused excessive head movement. Sound quality The standout feature of the Freebuds Pro 4 is, without a doubt, the audio performance. Huawei has incorporated a dual-driver configuration along with an 11 mm quad-magnet dynamic driver that delivers bass down to 14 Hz and treble levels reaching 48 kHz, thanks to the planar diaphragm tweeter. The sound quality and notably rich bass are immediately evident when wearing the earbuds. Having tested numerous earbuds from various smartphone manufacturers, we find Huawei's offering to be exceptional; the company truly excelled in this instance. We paired the earbuds with an Android phone, a Huawei device, a desktop using a Bluetooth dongle, and a laptop that has built-in Bluetooth. The connectivity was seamless and worthy of high-end earbuds. We specifically discussed this topic with a Huawei VP, who confirmed that the developers in Shenzhen put significant effort into optimizing connectivity and sound quality for rapid toggling. At the launch event, Huawei presented a video featuring a user wearing the earbuds in the midst of a concert, yet due to the cutting-edge noise cancellation, they could also join a meeting. We gave this a try, but the outcome was less impressive than anticipated. Our assigned reviewer attended a large techno party with thousands of attendees and attempted to make a phone call. The person on the other end could still hear the music, but was able to catch the voice; however, the reviewer had difficulty hearing the quieter sounds. Certainly, this is an anecdotal example, and with the ambient noise exceeding 110 dB you can't really expect miracles. In more moderate settings, the buds perform very well. Charging During our first impressions, we noticed that the Freebuds Pro 4 felt bulkier compared to the Pro 3. However, it turns out that both models have identical battery capacities. Each bud is equipped with a 55 mAh cell, while the case provides an additional 510 mAh. Below is a summary of the charging times as stated by Huawei and the actual times we recorded after multiple charging sessions. To calculate the case and the earbuds, simply add the earbuds time to the case. Advertised time Real-life time Earbuds in the case 40 minutes 45 minutes Case only (wired) 1 hour 65 minutes Case only (wireless) 1.5 hours/150 minutes 160 minutes We must acknowledge that we had significant difficulty reducing the earbuds' battery to zero, as it requires hours of continuous use to fully deplete the battery. Once you place the buds back into the case, it resets the entire process, and the truth is, very few people actually manage to drain their earbuds to 0. Using a wireless charger for the case is what we found to be the most convenient option. It worked seamlessly and didn't take too long to recharge. Battery life We extensively tested the Freebuds Pro 4 to determine an average charging value, and we also gathered insights on battery performance across nearly all scenarios, particularly noting the two modes that prioritize either sound quality or connectivity. Below are our findings from 30 days of continuous use. Advertised Playtime Real-life Playtime Prioritize Sound Quality (ANC on) 6.5 hours 360 minutes/6 hours Prioritize Sound Quality (ANC off) 4.5 hours 220 minutes/3 hours 40 minutes Prioritize Connection Quality (ANC on) 7 hours 380 minutes/6 hours 20 minutes Prioritize Connection Quality (ANC off) 5 hours 240 minutes/4 hours All tests were conducted using Freebuds connected to an Android smartphone, rather than a Huawei device with EMUI. The manufacturer noted that their results were based on tests with a Huawei Mate X6, with audio set to 50%. While lowering the volume and using a Huawei phone could slightly improve battery life, we determined that conducting tests on a non-Huawei smartphone is more logical, given the company's small global market share. Conclusion Huawei has delivered a solid upgrade with the Freebuds Pro 4. They output excellent sound with lossless transmission, offer excellent battery life, and great noise cancellation for this category. During the announcement, Huawei set a price of €199, but none of the Euro-using countries is currently offer these audio devices. The only European nations selling the Freebuds Pro 4 are Turkey and Russia, and we can only hope that the buds will become available soon in the EU. Huawei Freebuds Pro 4 (left) and Freebuds Pro 3 (right)Huawei has introduced the Freebuds to key Pacific markets, including Indonesia, the Philippines, parts of the Middle East, and Northern Africa. If you're outside these regions, you can still purchase the 15-month-old Freebuds Pro 3. However, if you reside in those areas, we strongly suggest opting for the Freebuds Pro 4. Pros The best sound for Huawei Freebuds. Battery life is reliable. Quick connectivity. Attractive price. Plenty of noise cancellation options. Cons Golden trim might not be for everyone. Limited availability in key markets. Not that big of an improvement over its predecessor. Pinching gestures need user's adaptation.",
