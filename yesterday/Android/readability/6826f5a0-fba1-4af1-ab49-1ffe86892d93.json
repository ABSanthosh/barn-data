As with the other A-series devices, this is to become the most affordable model in the current generation Pixel lineup and starts at a relatively modest $499. The unit we have with us comes in the Obsidian variant, which is completely blacked out like the monolith from 2001. The 9a also comes in blue, white, and a pink version depending on your region.

As with the other A-series devices, this is to become the most affordable model in the current generation Pixel lineup and starts at a relatively modest $499. The unit we have with us comes in the Obsidian variant, which is completely blacked out like the monolith from 2001. The 9a also comes in blue, white, and a pink version depending on your region. The front of the device features the comically thick bezels that the A-series has come to be known for underneath a flat Gorilla Glass 3. The aluminum side frame is also flat, much like on the bigger Pixel 9 models. Finally, the back features a flat plastic panel to complete the monolithic appearance. A notable detail of the back is the camera design. Gone is the Among Us visor found on the bigger Pixel 9 models and instead there's just a pill-shaped glass that sits almost flush with the back. On the black model, it's barely noticeable but it does stick out a bit on the other colors and looks quite bland. In comparison, the previous A-series phones more convincingly mimicked the appearance of their more expensive siblings. Google also provided us with its color-matched case for the phone. It would have been nice if the case came bundled with the phone but that's asking too much from a phone that doesn't even come with its own charger. The case provides good coverage but you do not want to see what it does to the already thick bezels. We are currently working on our review for the phone where we will discuss more things, including the display, the camera, the performance, and the software. Follow us on social media for updates on the Pixel 9a and other new and upcoming launches.",
