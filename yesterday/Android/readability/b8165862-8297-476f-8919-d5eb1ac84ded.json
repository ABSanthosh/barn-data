  "text": "WD Black SN850X PCIe 4.0 SSD $530 $880 Save $350 The WD Black SN850X is a slightly upgraded version of the regular SN850. It's one of the best PCIe 4.0 SSDs on the market, and can be used in a gaming PC or a PS5. Grab this 8TB version for one of its best prices as it drops to just $530. If you've been looking to really upgrade the storage on your PC or game console, this 8TB M.2 SSD might be just what you're looking for. The WD Black SN850X not only offers a lot of storage, but the performance is also quite good as well. The best part is that this particular model is now on sale from Amazon, with a steep discount that knocks $350 off the original retail price. What's great about the WD Black SN850X M.2 SSD? Source: Western Digital SSDs are the way to go if you're looking to get the best performance out of your device. So what kind of performance are we looking at with the SN850X? Well, when it comes to sequential read speeds, the SSD can reach up to 7,200MB/s, while sequential write speeds top out at up to 6,600 MB/s. For the most part, this SSD can be used in nearly all kinds of builds, and can even bring some drastic improvements to supported game consoles as well. In addition to the above, you get excellent reliability as well, with Western Digital providing up to five years of coverage. As stated before, this is one of the best prices we've seen on this SSD, making it a good time to pick one up. If you don't need 8TB, you can also purchase smaller storage sizes, with 4TB, 2TB, and 1TB options. But if you're looking to go big, then this 8TB model is going to be for you.",

to go if you\u0026#39;re looking to get the best performance out of your device. So what kind of performance are we looking at with the SN850X? Well, when it comes to sequential read speeds, the SSD can reach up to 7,200MB/s, while sequential write speeds top out at up to 6,600 MB/s.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eFor the most part, this SSD can be used in nearly all kinds of builds, and can even bring some drastic improvements to supported game consoles as well. In addition to the above, you get excellent reliability as well, with Western Digital providing up to five years of coverage.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eAs stated before, this is one of the best prices we\u0026#39;ve seen on this SSD, making it a good time to pick one up. If you don\u0026#39;t need 8TB, you can also purchase smaller storage sizes, with 4TB, 2TB, and 1TB options. But if you\u0026#39;re looking to go big, then this 8TB model is going to be for you.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
