  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Google dropped a surprise Snapseed update for Apple devices. The update includes a major UI overhaul that makes editing photos even easier. It's unclear whether this update will be available for Android devices. Google's Snapseed has been around for quite some time, and while it's still a great editing tool for beginners, it never really advanced with the times, with most thinking that it has just kind of fallen by the wayside, with Google prioritizing other projects instead. Related With that said, it appears that Google hasn't entirely forgotten about the app, and has instead, dropped a pretty major update for those using Apple products. The news comes from the folks at 9to5Google, sharing that Snapseed 3.0 is now available for the iPhone and iPad, bringing a new overhauled UI that should make editing photos a lot easier. The first big change in years Source: Google The new look makes things a lot simpler when compared to the previous menu system, bringing important options front and center. The system is now sorted into three columns, with Looks, Faves, and Tools being available. In addition to the more in-your-face changes, 9to5Google shares that controls for some of the tools are much easier to access as well. While swiping left and right can make changes using various tools, the news outlet also highlights that Google has added the ability to swipe up and down to access options as well. With the Faves section, you can jump straight to the editing tools you use most, which can be a big deal if you rely on your phone to edit a lot of photos. Of course, the big question here is whether this update is coming to Android devices. While the update would be a great surprise, some might even wonder whether it's even necessary anymore, considering that there are so many other quality options. With that said, we know there are some die-hard Snapseed fans, and with over 1 million downloads, we know that there's potentially a lot of interest. We'll be sure to keep an eye out for any changes that might come. And if you're curious about Snapseed for Android, and have never used it, you can download the current iteration from the Google Play Store.",

dropped a pretty major update for those using Apple products. The news comes from the \u003ca href=\"https://9to5google.com/2025/06/12/snapseed-3-0-update-iphone/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efolks at 9to5Google\u003c/a\u003e, sharing that \u003ca href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapseed-photo-editor/id439438619\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSnapseed 3.0 is now available for the iPhone and iPad\u003c/a\u003e, bringing a new overhauled UI that should make editing photos a lot easier.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"the-first-big-change-in-years\"\u003e\n                        The first big change in years\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n    \n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapseed-photo-editor/id439438619?platform=ipad\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoogle\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe new look makes things a lot simpler when compared to the previous menu system, bringing important options front and center. The system is now sorted into three columns, with Looks, Faves, and Tools being available. In addition to the more in-your-face changes, 9to5Google shares that controls for some of the tools are much easier to access as well.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eWhile swiping left and right can make changes using various tools, the news outlet also highlights that Google has added the ability to swipe up and down to access options as well. With the Faves section, you can jump straight to the editing tools you use most, which can be a big deal if you rely on your phone to edit a lot of photos. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eOf course, the big question here is whether this update is coming to Android devices. While the update would be a great surprise, some might even wonder whether it\u0026#39;s even necessary anymore, considering that there are \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/best-image-editing-apps-phone-photography/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eso many other quality options\u003c/a\u003e. With that said, we know there are some die-hard Snapseed fans, and with over 1 million downloads, we know that there\u0026#39;s potentially a lot of interest.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eWe\u0026#39;ll be sure to keep an eye out for any changes that might come. And if you\u0026#39;re curious about Snapseed for Android, and have never used it, you can download the current iteration from the Google Play Store.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n    \n\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
