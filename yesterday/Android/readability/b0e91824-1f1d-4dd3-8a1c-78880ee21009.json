  "text": "Using Home Assistant for smart home automation is for the brave. Want to make the IoT systems work with Home Assistant? You've got to put in some hours and embrace the learning curve. If you're game for a challenge, you can add Node-RED into the Home Assistant and level up smart home automation with some complex ones. The default visual and YAML-based editing options in Home Assistant for crafting automations are enough for most folks. Creating layered ones that include several conditions doesn't guarantee they will work. You can overcome that with a programming approach and do it all inside the Home Assistant interface. Here's an account of how I automated my home with Home Assistant and Node-RED. Related I can't live without these 5 free Home Assistant add-ons These Home Assistant add-ons are genuinely fantastic, and convinced me to switch to HAOS in the first place. 5 Tackling the nodes and flows with patience One step at a time After spending several weekends catching up with Home Assistant, Node-RED looks exciting. However, the learning curve is pretty steep with Node-RED if you've just picked Home Assistant. It felt a bit daunting initially, but reading the official documentation helped me understand the terminology. Hovering a mouse pointer on a node reveals a brief description. The good part is that you'll run Node-RED inside Home Assistant and install it easily, just like other add-ons. Note that Node-RED isn't available with the default Home Assistant add-ons, and you'll need to install the HACS (Home Assistant Community Store) to grab it. Getting started was quick, and I could easily create simple two-step automations. 4 Remember the basics to fix your automation Hit that Deploy button Let me leave you with a tip: turn off the ad blockers. Node-RED may not work if any aggressive ad blockers are active. I learned the hard way and now use Home Assistant in a separate, dedicated browser without ad blockers or extensions. There were times when the flows wouldn't work at all when I'd forget to hit the Deploy button. Now, you can either deploy everything, or just the modified nodes or flows. Tinkering with the nodes to make them work with the flows is rewarding, and you can watch them in action by creating a custom Node-RED dashboard inside the add-on. Of course, the flow-style options will help you design a custom dashboard of your liking. 3 Scour through the library for nodes, flows, and collections Find inspiration The rich Node-RED library contains thousands of collections, flows, and nodes, which helped me keep the ball rolling and create several automations. I experienced several hiccups while creating multiple flows and testing them simultaneously. Some advanced flows and collections are dependent on specific nodes. For example, I tried using the Raspberry Pi system monitoring flow, but that didn't work because I overlooked the requirements. The Node-RED library serves as a smorgasbord of nodes for you to try, so take things slow, one automation flow at a time. Some flows and collections will add new nodes to your existing HA library. Unfortunately, you'll have to search for those nodes to add to your existing or new flows. 2 Tricky way of fixing your borked automation Look for the clues Typically, you'll need to forage through the logs to check why a particular automation didn't work. For me, that often meant googling to locate a forum and finding a solution. However, Node-RED offers a nifty mechanism that shows the state of a node right under it. For instance, I often get 'no connection' or 'error' under the node. That has saved me from combing through text-heavy logs. Besides that, there's a Debug option in the top-right corner to check when automation throws an error. You can make the best of the debug log since it often contains details about a specific node not working and an error message. Whenever my automation broke, I looked under the nodes in the flow sheet and then checked the debug log. Ask for help and you'll get it Several times, the engaging community of Node-RED users stepped up to help troubleshoot or guide them with the Home Assistant integrations. Like many others, I found several tips and helpful information to help me catch up with automation. Building automation using web and script-based components is quite challenging. It's great to have a helping hand or a guiding solution when you've hit the wall, especially if you're not well-versed in JSON script. Whether you're browsing the Home Assistant or Node-RED communities, use the search option to see if someone has already encountered the same problem. I often found solutions to the errors I encountered that way. Related 8 Home Assistant HACS integrations you simply must try HACS can improve your Home Assistant and transform your smart home. Here are some examples of how. When you're ready, go with the Node-RED flow Crafting automation doesn't take long, but you may end up with hundreds of them in Home Assistant. And scrolling through the ones that didn't work is a pain. Instead of making ones that overlap or depend on other automation, try out Node-RED to create several complex and interdependent automation flows. It is a complicated tool if you have little to no programming experience. So start with a few at a time if you don't want the Home Assistant turning into an exploding goose. But if you're running Home Assistant, you're a DIY enthusiast already. If making automations, Node-RED gets fatiguing, so take a break and try these cool things with Home Assistant. Home Assistant",

Node-RED may not work if any aggressive ad blockers are active. I learned the hard way and now use Home Assistant in a separate, dedicated browser without ad blockers or extensions. There were times when the flows wouldn\u0026#39;t work at all when I\u0026#39;d forget to hit the Deploy button. Now, you can either deploy everything, or just the modified nodes or flows.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eTinkering with the nodes to make them work with the flows is rewarding, and you can watch them in action by creating a custom Node-RED dashboard inside the add-on.

I experienced several hiccups while creating multiple flows and testing them simultaneously. Some advanced flows and collections are dependent on specific nodes. For example, I tried using the \u003ca href=\"https://flows.nodered.org/flow/b7289a6d5b6a187481667b9c1a77d9ff\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRaspberry Pi system monitoring\u003c/a\u003e flow, but that didn\u0026#39;t work because I overlooked the requirements.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe Node-RED library serves as a smorgasbord of nodes for you to try, so take things slow, one automation flow at a time. Some flows and collections will add new nodes to your existing HA library.

didn\u0026#39;t work. For me, that often meant googling to locate a forum and finding a solution. However, Node-RED offers a nifty mechanism that shows the state of a node right under it. For instance, I often get \u0026#39;no connection\u0026#39; or \u0026#39;error\u0026#39; under the node. That has saved me from combing through text-heavy logs. Besides that, there\u0026#39;s a Debug option in the top-right corner to check when automation throws an error. You can make the best of the debug log since it often contains details about a specific node not working and an error message. Whenever my automation broke, I looked under the nodes in the flow sheet and then checked the debug log.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch3 id=\"ask-for-help-and-you-39-ll-get-it\"\u003e\n            Ask for
