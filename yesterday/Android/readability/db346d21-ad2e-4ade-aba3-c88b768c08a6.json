  "text": "Sign in to your XDA account Summary Microsoft urges Windows 10 users to adopt Windows 11 to avoid risks before support ends. Most Windows users are reluctant to upgrade due to affordability and PC compatibility issues. The Linux community is capitalizing on Microsoft's sales tactic, offering an alternative for \"exiles.\" It's no secret that Windows 10 will lose support on October 14, 2025. As Microsoft begins putting the operating system to rest, it would really, really like for people using it to migrate over to Windows 11 right about now. The problem is, people use Windows 10 more than they do Windows 11, and the company is having a tough time shifting people over. Things started nicely, with Microsoft suggesting people get a Windows 11 device before time runs out. Then, the Copilot+ devices came out, and Microsoft pushed those, too. Now, the company is just flat out declaring that, if you don't upgrade from Windows 10, you're not going to be on \"the right side of risk.\" Related Microsoft begins turning up the heat on Windows 10 users As spotted by Windows Central, Microsoft has uploaded a video to its Windows YouTube account. The start of the video reminds us that \"Security updates for Windows 10 are ending October 14, 2025.\" It then tells us to \"Upgrade now to a Windows 11 PC\" so that we can \"stay on the right side of risk.\" It then covers some of the benefits of using Windows 11, security-wise. As you might imagine from YouTube comments, people haven't been very receptive to this video. The top comment at the time of writing simply reads, \"Using the end of support for your old operating system as a selling point for your new one is actually insane.\" Others ask Microsoft what to do if their PC doesn't support Windows 11, and if the company believes people have the money lying around to pick up a new PC. There's also a recurring theme about people using this opportunity to switch over to Linux. This is something the Linux community itself has been capitalizing on, when we saw the End of 10 project set up to help the transition over to Tux's domain. We also recently saw KDE open its doors to what it calls \"Windows 10 exiles,\" detailing how to keep an old PC going using Plasma. As we move towards the end-of-support date for Windows 10, we'll likely see a big tug-of-war between Microsoft and Linux as both sides try to win over the hearts and minds of those still hanging on. As for me, I've made my choice already. Windows",

target=\"_blank\"\u003eWindows Central\u003c/a\u003e, Microsoft has uploaded a video to its Windows YouTube account. The start of the video reminds us that \u0026#34;Security updates for Windows 10 are ending October 14, 2025.\u0026#34; It then tells us to \u0026#34;Upgrade now to a Windows 11 PC\u0026#34; so that we can \u0026#34;stay on the right side of risk.\u0026#34; It then covers some of the benefits of using Windows 11, security-wise.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eAs you might imagine from YouTube comments, people haven\u0026#39;t been very receptive to this video. The top comment at the time of writing simply reads, \u0026#34;Using the end of support for your old operating system as a selling point for your new one is actually insane.\u0026#34; Others ask Microsoft what to do if their PC doesn\u0026#39;t support Windows 11, and if the company believes people have the money lying around to pick up a new PC.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s also a recurring theme about people using this opportunity to switch over to Linux. This is something the Linux community itself has been capitalizing on, when we saw the \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/end-of-10-group-windows-10-pcs-landfills-linux/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEnd of 10 project\u003c/a\u003e set up to help the transition over to Tux\u0026#39;s domain. We also recently saw \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/kde-windows-10-exiles/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKDE open its doors to what it calls \u0026#34;Windows 10 exiles,\u0026#34;\u003c/a\u003e detailing how to keep an old PC going using Plasma.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eAs we move towards the end-of-support date for Windows 10, we\u0026#39;ll likely see a big tug-of-war between Microsoft and Linux as both sides try to win over the hearts and minds of those still hanging on.
