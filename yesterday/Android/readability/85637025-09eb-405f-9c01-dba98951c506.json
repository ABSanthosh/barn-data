  "text": "Accessories Backbone One $70 $125 Save $55 This is the controller to get if you're looking to take your mobile gaming to new levels. Right now, you can score a hefty discount on the Backbone One from Woot as it drop to just $70. Controllers are a great way to take your mobile gaming experience to new levels. And while there are a lot of different options, only a select few are going to be really worth your time and money. The Backbone One controller is going to be one of them, offering a fantastic design that works with most phones, and proper controls that really feel great in hand. Related Backbone One review: The controller Android gamers deserve Backbone's controller is one of the best for Android, but the PlayStation Edition could use a few more buttons In fact, we gave this controller a 9 out of 10 in our review, making it one of our top choices when buying a gaming controller for your Android phone. And with its newly discounted price from Woot, it becomes an absolute no-brainer as it drops to its lowest price yet, at just $70 for a limited time or while supplies last. What's great about the Backbone One? The Backbone One is a controller that we really loved, thanks to its sleek design and incredible feel. It's also compatible with a number of different phones thanks to its ability to contract and expand, and there's even USB-C passthrough charging that will allow you to play all day without having to unplug. When it comes to parts of the controller, you get a D-pad, analog sticks, and an array of buttons. The controller also features a 3.5mm audio jack, along with an app that can also elevate the experience. What's great is that this controller is really quite versatile, allowing you to play games with native apps, and even streaming services. You can even pair it with other devices as well, like a computer or tablet, and use it like a regular controller. For the most part, you really aren't going to find controllers that are better for this price. The Backbone One is easy to take with you on the go, and provides an excellent experience for all your gaming needs. The best part is that it's now down to a fantastic low price that can't be ignored. So grab it from Woot for just $70 while you can. This version comes with the controller and also a carrying case. This deal won't be around for long since Woot usually has a limited supply.",

It\u0026#39;s also compatible with a number of different phones thanks to its ability to contract and expand, and there\u0026#39;s even USB-C passthrough charging that will allow you to play all day without having to unplug.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to parts of the controller, you get a D-pad, analog sticks, and an array of buttons. The controller also features a 3.5mm audio jack, along with an app that can also elevate the experience. What\u0026#39;s great is that this controller is really quite versatile, allowing you to play games with native apps, and even streaming services.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eYou can even pair it with other devices as well, like a computer or tablet, and use it like a regular controller. For the most part, you really aren\u0026#39;t going to find controllers that are better for this price. The Backbone One is easy to take with you on the go, and provides an excellent experience for all your gaming needs.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe best part is that it\u0026#39;s now down to a fantastic low price that can\u0026#39;t be ignored. So grab it from Woot for just $70 while you can. This version comes with the controller and also a carrying case. This deal won\u0026#39;t be around for long since Woot usually has a limited supply.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
