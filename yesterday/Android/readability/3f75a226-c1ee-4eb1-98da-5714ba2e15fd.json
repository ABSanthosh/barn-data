The Google Pixel 7a launched two years ago, in May of 2023. It was a typical “a”-series Pixel, with no particularly bad press around it at the time of its launch, and for a Pixel launch, that's as good as things can get. However, it has been two years since the device was announced, and it seems to have a particularly pesky issue. Users with the Google Pixel 7a have noticed that their batteries are swollen, which obviously, shouldn't be happening within two years of having a smartphone and using it daily. The issue is notable enough that Google has now just announced an extended repair program to give you the chance to fix it for free, as well as other options. Who Is Eligible for a Pixel 7a Battery Replacement? If you have a Google Pixel 7a with a battery that is swelling, you might notice it because the back panel is bulging or has popped off entirely. Even if there are no visual signs of swelling, other signs that something is going wrong with your battery include it draining a lot quicker than usual and even failing to charge. The good thing is, whether you can notice actual swelling or not, any of these symptoms will make you eligible for a free fix. To be sure that you're eligible, you can use the support page below, enter the required details, and answer the necessary questions. You'll be able to see which replacement options are available to you if you qualify. However, keep in mind that a phone with evidence of water, blunt force, or puncture damage will not be eligible for a free fix. Image: Google It doesn't matter whether your Google Pixel 7a is out of warranty already. Google will give you the chance to replace your swollen or affected battery one time at no extra charge. However, this option is only available to users who take it to an eligible walk-in repair center or mail it in, though only some countries support the latter. The following table shows the seven supported countries for a free battery replacement and the repair options available: CountryWalk-in RepairMail-in RepairUnited StatesYesYesUnited KingdomYesNoCanadaYesNoIndiaYesYesJapanYesNoGermanyYesNoSingaporeYesNo In Other Markets, Google Will Appease You With Cash Image: Google In the event that you don't live in any of the seven countries above, or you live in one of the countries that solely have walk-in options (i.e, excluding India and the United States), you'll have the choice to continue with your swollen battery but take another form of compensation from Google. They include the following: Phone is out of warranty: The equivalent of $200 in your local currency The equivalent of $300 in your local currency, applied as a discount towards the purchase of another Pixel smartphone on the Google Store Phone is still under warranty: The equivalent of $456 in your local currency Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast.
