  "text": "Earlier this April, shifting tariff policies in North America forced several consumer tech brands to re-think their product pricing, resulting in some significant price hikes. One of these was OnePlus, which raised the OnePlus Watch 3’s price to $499.99, a considerably higher markup from its $329.99 launch price. READ: OnePlus Watch 3 debuts with incredible 16-day battery life With that being said, it looks like the company is bringing the OnePlus Watch 3’s price down again—according to an official statement from Spenser Blank, Head of Marketing \u0026 Communications for OnePlus North America: …After further evaluation, we’re pleased to share that recent adjustments in our supply chain have allowed us to pass some savings back to those who are interested in purchasing the OnePlus Watch 3 in the U.S. As a result, the OnePlus Watch 3 in the U.S. is now available at its new price of $349.99; this is the final MSRP price and will not be changed going forward. Blank adds that buyers who purchased the OnePlus Watch 3 for $499.99 will receive a refund in the difference to their original payment method, and will be contacted directly by the OnePlus Customer Support team. The company maintains that it wants to keep the watch at a more competitive price point in spite of current US market changes.",
