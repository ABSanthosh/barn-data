It makes sense to use the same OS that powers the Vision Pro, but the bad news is that Apple smart glasses are apparently still three years away, or even more. Apple allegedly wanted to come out with a pair of smart glasses as a follow-up to the Vision Pro, so presumably within a year or two, but \"the technical challenges were just too great\". So now Apple wants to bridge the gap between the Vision Pro and the smart glasses by releasing \"other devices in the style of Vision Pro\" that will be cheaper and thus hopefully more enticing to consumers. Those, however, are unlikely to ship this year. Source",
