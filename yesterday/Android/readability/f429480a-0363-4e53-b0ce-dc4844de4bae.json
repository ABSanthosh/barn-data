They can be configured for remote access, and collaboration within the Local Area Network (LAN), and run advanced services such as media streaming, surveillance and security, and even web servers. Although causing damage to a NAS can prove challenging, there are some things you may be doing that could have the potential for undesired results. Related Best NAS devices in 2025 Expand your PC storage with one of these NAS enclosures 5 Shut the NAS down too often A NAS isn't like a PC. It's more like a server, which is designed to remain online for longer periods. The drives inside your NAS are also designed this way, so long as you use NAS-rated storage. It's best to leave your NAS running, even if you're not planning to use it for a few hours. If using mechanical HDDS, the platters and motors prefer to remain spinning instead of halting and starting again as that process causes more wear and tear. I would only shut down your NAS if you know it won't be accessed for a matter of days, not hours. Depending on the network and NAS, you can configure it to Wake On LAN (WOL), a useful setting that allows for remote power-on signals to be sent from other hardware. It's also why I always recommend setting up your NAS where the constant drone of spinning drives and fans won't cause a nuisance. 4 Halt the NAS using the power outlet You should never do this. No, seriously. Never halt your NAS using the outlet it's connected to. This could be a power strip or wall outlet. A NAS should always be powered off using the web GUI, power button, or official app. This is to allow the operating system to safely end processes and inform drives the system will soon power off. Halting the device suddenly can cause damage to mechanical HDDs and even corrupt data. This is also why it's important to consider a UPS. 3 No UPS to handle power grid outages An Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) is a large battery pack enclosed inside a power strip. The role of a UPS is to ensure power is not interrupted if the supply is cut from the outlet for some reason. This could be an accidental switch press or the national grid failing in your area. Should an issue with the power supply be detected by the UPS, it will immediately switch to the battery without causing any connected devices to power off. A UPS is recommended for a NAS and networking equipment, allowing you to remain online even during longer power outages. Some NAS can even have a data link with the UPS, allowing the OS to read the current state of the UPS (whether it's discharging) and how much battery remains. This can be handy when configuring the NAS to safely shut down when the UPS battery depletes to a specific level. 2 Run the NAS with limited ventilation Although a NAS doesn't produce as much heat as your desktop PC, it's still a server wrapped up in a smaller shell. Drives, the motherboard, CPU, RAN, and all other components inside the NAS chassis all produce waste heat, which needs to be exhausted out of the system. Most NAS will have at least one fan spinning to help push (or pull) cool air through the system, so you mustn't place the device somewhere with restricted airflow. cupboards can be fine, so long as it has ample cutouts for air to be drawn in. I recommend installing a fan or two to increase circulation around installed hardware, especially if the NAS is joined by other equipment. Related 1 Using the wrong RAM This can be a real issue when upgrading your NAS with faster or higher-capacity modules. You must ensure the new modules match the currently installed RAM or the specifications of your NAS. Mismatching your new modules and the slots inside the NAS can cause you some serious headaches. The same goes for a PC upgrade. Installing incompatible memory can cause either the motherboard, RAM, CPU, or all three to experience problems. So long as you use the correct RAM module type, generation, and speed, you should be fine. Some NAS models will even support faster RAM than what's specified by the manufacturer, though your mileage will vary depending on the CPU and other components inside the chassis. It's easy to not cause your NAS damage You have to try to cause damage to your NAS as they're fairly resilient devices. So long as you don't go installing it inside a dusty cupboard with no airflow, shut it down from its power source, and install incompatible hardware, you'll have zero trouble. We've got beginner guides and handy tips to help you get on the right path before storing all your sensitive data and maximizing your NAS lifespan. And always remember to follow the 3-2-1 backup rule at the very least.",

It\u0026#39;s more like a server, which is designed to remain online for longer periods. The drives inside your NAS are also designed this way, so long as you use NAS-rated storage. It\u0026#39;s best to leave your NAS running, even if you\u0026#39;re not planning to use it for a few hours. If using mechanical HDDS, the platters and motors prefer to remain spinning instead of halting and starting again as that process causes more wear and tear.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eI would only shut down your NAS if you know it won\u0026#39;t be accessed for a matter of days, not hours. Depending on the network and NAS, you can configure it to \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/why-you-might-want-to-set-up-wake-on-lan-on-your-pc/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWake On LAN (WOL)\u003c/a\u003e, a useful setting that allows for remote power-on signals to be sent from other hardware. It\u0026#39;s also why I always recommend setting up your NAS where the constant drone of spinning drives and fans won\u0026#39;t cause a nuisance.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"halt-the-nas-using-the-power-outlet\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e4 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Halt the NAS using the power outlet\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should never do this. No, seriously. Never halt your NAS using the outlet it\u0026#39;s connected to. This could be a power strip or wall outlet. A NAS should always be powered off using the web GUI, power button, or official app. This is to allow the operating system to safely end processes and inform drives the system will soon power off. Halting the device suddenly can cause damage to mechanical HDDs and even corrupt data.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThis is also why it\u0026#39;s important to consider a UPS.\u003c/p\u003e

The role of a UPS is to ensure power is not interrupted if the supply is cut from the outlet for some reason. This could be an accidental switch press or the national grid failing in your area. Should an issue with the power supply be detected by the UPS, it will immediately switch to the battery without causing any connected devices to power off.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eA UPS is recommended for a NAS and networking equipment, allowing you to remain online even during longer power outages. Some NAS can even have a data link with the UPS, allowing the OS to read the current state of the UPS (whether it\u0026#39;s discharging) and how much battery remains. This can be handy when configuring the NAS to safely shut down when the UPS battery depletes to a specific level.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"run-the-nas-with-limited-ventilation\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e2 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Run the NAS with limited ventilation\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough a NAS doesn\u0026#39;t produce as much heat as your desktop PC, it\u0026#39;s still a server wrapped up in a smaller shell. Drives, the motherboard, CPU, RAN, and all other components inside the NAS chassis all produce waste heat, which needs to be exhausted out of the system. Most NAS will have at least one fan spinning to help push (or pull) cool air through the system, so you mustn\u0026#39;t place the device somewhere with restricted airflow.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003ecupboards can be fine, so long as it has ample cutouts for air to be drawn in. I recommend installing a fan or two to increase circulation around installed hardware, especially if the NAS is joined by other equipment.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n
