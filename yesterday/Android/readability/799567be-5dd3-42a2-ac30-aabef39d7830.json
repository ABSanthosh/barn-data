The best part about the end of the year is that it brings to us the glorious magic of holiday deals, and if there's something that no one has ever complained about in the history of man, it's being able to save money. The good thing is that savings galore never leaves out mobile carriers, at least in the US, and Visible is the latest to throw a good deal your way. The carrier is going to be dropping the prices on its Visible and Visible+ plans, and the best part is that you can lock in those prices for over two years. The Carrier Drops Visible And Visible Plus Plans To $20 And $30 A Month, Respectively Image: Visible Visible is an MVNO that is owned by Verizon and operates on its networks. If you're looking for mobile plans that offer a lot of value for less than the big carriers do, Visible is a good place to find yourself. They're making an even stronger case for themselves with the New Year's deals that they've just announced, giving you the chance to get the Visible and Visible+ plans for less than usual. The regular Visible plan is going to be dropping to just $20 a month, coming from a usual price of $25 a month. However, you can save even more with the Visible+ plan. That one is only going to set you back by $30 each month when it would normally cost you $45. That's 33% in savings compared to the normal price, so that's certainly the kind of deal that we're quick to take notice of. That's not even the best part though. Using the promo code SWITCH25 when checking out, Visible will give you either of those plans at that price for 25 months straight. Yep, you don't even need to use the annual payment plan. As long as you make that payment before this deal expires on January 31st, you'll be locking that price in for the next two years. That means the entirety of 2026 and 2027. This Deal Helps You Save Even More Than The Annual Plan Does Image: Visible If you're a usual patron of the annual plan, you might want to switch over to monthly for the next two years. I get that paying for an annual plan saves you from the headache of your phone bill for the rest of the year, but at the moment, this New Year's deal offers a better discount over the course of a year than the annual plan does. Perhaps this is your time to give it a go. What Do Visible's Plans Offer? Image: Visible If you're strongly considering switching over to Visible on the strength of this New Year deal, then you might want to know exactly what the carrier brings to the table. The first thing that you should take note of is that you get unlimited talk, text, and data on Verizon's LTE and 5G networks. You also get automated blocking of spam and robocalls, the ability to use your phone as a mobile hotspot, and unlimited talk and text to Mexico and Canada. However, for those who need more, you can opt for the Visible+ plan. You get some added perks, including unlimited access to Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband network, 50GB of data on the LTE and regular 5G networks, included smartwatch service at no extra cost, and your mobile hotspot is twice as fast as the regular plan. Plus, there are a lot more perks for international calling, texting, and roaming. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
