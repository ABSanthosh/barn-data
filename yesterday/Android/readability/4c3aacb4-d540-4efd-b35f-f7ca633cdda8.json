Then, a couple of days ago, it seemingly ran Geekbench revealing its chipset, RAM amount, and Android version. But there's a plot twist. According to newly leaked promotional materials, the device that was benchmarked was actually the K13 Turbo Pro, which will launch alongside the K13 Turbo. The Pro model is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 SoC, while the non-Pro device is equipped with MediaTek's Dimensity 8450 chipset instead. Both of them feature a built-in cooling fan, and both will inevitably be aimed at mobile gamers. The K13 Turbo Pro will be available in four RAM/storage combos: 12/256GB, 16/256GB, 12/512GB, and 16/512GB. The K13 Turbo, on the other hand, will have to do with just three: 12/256GB, 16/256GB, and 12/512GB. The image above purportedly shows one of them, with a very visible cutout in the side of its case for the fan. Rumors in China say the duo will get official on July 21, and undoubtedly we'll be hearing a lot more about these two before then, so stay tuned. Source (in Chinese) | Via",
