  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account As we get closer to summer, we're heading into a new season of phone releases, with heavy hitters expected to come from Samsung and Google. In addition, there's a pretty good chance that we're going to see some new wearables from both companies as well, with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic being some of the more exciting ones to look out for. Related While we'd typically be left guessing what to expect, that isn't the case this year, with the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic making an alleged early appearance thanks to an eBay listing for the product. As you can imagine, this type of leak is pretty shocking, especially considering that most times all we get are early renders of the device ahead of its launch. Of course, while the images of the product are exciting, it's also important to get the details, since we can learn a lot just from its specifications. One of the more concerning aspects of the Watch 8 Classic was that it was only going to come in one size. Well, it looks like we're getting some more confirmation on this front from a relatively reliable source, as MysteryLupin on X has shared that the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic will indeed arrive in just one size, coming in at 46mm (via 9to5Google). This may be a big deal for some With that said, this information isn't completely new, as we've seen reports on the one-size offering before. However, with another source chiming in, this pretty much solidifies that the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic will be offered in just one size, which could be a bummer to some. The previous Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, which was released a couple of years ago, was made available in two sizes, with a 43mm and 47mm variant. Moving over to one size could be a change that's aimed at capturing those looking for a new replacement for their Galaxy Watch Ultra. In addition to the one size for the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, MysteryLupin also shares that this model will come with Wi-Fi and LTE, and will be available in two colors: black and white. For most people, this is going to be a huge release, with the rotating bezel being seen as the pinnacle of the Galaxy Watch can offer when it comes to design. Of course, there are going to be some major differences this year as well, with the device sporting a 'squircle' design. Whether you love it or hate it, it's pretty much a given that this watch is going to do some major sales numbers, like most of Samsung's wearables. If the larger size isn't your thing, at least you'll have the option of going with the Galaxy Watch 8, which should come in two sizes. The only real question that remains is how much this thing will cost.",

listing for the product\u003c/a\u003e. As you can imagine, this type of leak is pretty shocking, especially considering that most times all we get are \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/galaxy-watch-8-classic-360-renders/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eearly renders of the device ahead of its launch\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eOf course, while the images of the product are exciting, it\u0026#39;s also important to get the details, since we can learn a lot just from its specifications. One of the more concerning aspects of the Watch 8 Classic was that it was only going to come in one size. Well, it looks like we\u0026#39;re getting some more confirmation on this front from a relatively reliable source, as \u003ca href=\"https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1935045267189080535\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMysteryLupin on X\u003c/a\u003e has shared that the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic will indeed arrive in just one size, coming in at 46mm (via \u003ca href=\"https://9to5google.com/2025/06/17/galaxy-watch-8-classic-size-report/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e9to5Google\u003c/a\u003e). \u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"this-may-be-a-big-deal-for-some\"\u003e\n                        This may be a big deal for some\n               \u003c/h2\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003e With that said, this information isn\u0026#39;t completely new, as we\u0026#39;ve seen reports on the one-size offering before. However, with another source chiming in, this pretty much solidifies that the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic will be offered in just one size, which could be a bummer to some. The previous Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, which was released a couple of years ago, was made available in two sizes, with a 43mm and 47mm variant. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eMoving over to one size could be a change that\u0026#39;s aimed at capturing those looking for a new replacement for their Galaxy Watch Ultra. In addition to the one size for the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, MysteryLupin also shares that this model will come with Wi-Fi and LTE, and will be available in two colors: black and white. For most people, this is going to be a huge release, with the rotating bezel being seen as the pinnacle of the Galaxy Watch can offer when it comes to design. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eOf course, there are going to be some major differences this year as well, with the \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-may-bring-an-ultra-inspired-squircle-design/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edevice sporting a \u0026#39;squircle\u0026#39; design\u003c/a\u003e. Whether you love it or hate it, it\u0026#39;s pretty much a given that this watch is going to do some major sales numbers, like most of Samsung\u0026#39;s wearables. If the larger size isn\u0026#39;t your thing, at least you\u0026#39;ll have the option of going with the Galaxy Watch 8, which should come in two sizes. The only real question that remains is how much this thing will cost. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
