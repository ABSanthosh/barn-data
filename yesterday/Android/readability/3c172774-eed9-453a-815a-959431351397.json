  "text": "(Image credit: Samsung) Samsung's latest midrange masterpiece was just announced, but I've already uncovered a Galaxy A36 deal that deserves your immediate attention. Buy the A series device directly from the source and you'll be eligible for up to $150 of trade-in credit, a deal that could knock the price of the phone down to a mere $249.99. Samsung will also hook you up with some bundle opportunities and three free months of Peacock Premium, so it's seriously a gift that keeps on giving. Amazon's Big Spring Sale is March 25-31st: see all the best deals for Android usersAlthough Samsung's A Series never gets as much press attention as the OEM's flagships, these midrange devices typically make up a huge chunk of the Android phones sold every year, and it isn't hard to see why when you look at the specs. The new Galaxy A36 5G, for instance, boasts a gorgeous 6.7-inch FHD display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 1,200 nits of brightness, while under the hood you'll enjoy an efficient Octa-core processor and 5,000mAh battery. Like most of the best Samsung phones, the software promise with the A36 is also excellent, guaranteeing six years of OS/security updates. If you prefer the simplicity of unlocked phones, you can buy the Galaxy A36 from Amazon or Best Buy and get a free $50 gift card with your purchase, no strings attached. If, however, you have an old or broken phone lying around, why not use Samsung's trade-in tool to see how much you can save? After all, you're looking at over $350 of potential credit and free stuff, and as you know, every penny counts when you're shopping for smartphones.  Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android After almost a decade of working in the e-commerce space, Patrick Farmer (he/him) began his career at Android Central as a Deals and Commerce Writer before moving into a new role as AC's eCommerce Editor in 2023.
