Well, technically, the phones are already available, so this isn’t a pre-order deal, but it is a great one. The Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+ and S25 Ultra all have a free storage upgrade – that means 256GB for the vanilla model and 512GB for the other two. On top of that, there is a £100 discount at checkout and, if that wasn’t enough, there is a £100 credit too. We’ve published our Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review, so you can check that out, if you are still not certain whether it is the right phone for you. We are working on S25 and S25+ reviews as well, expect them soon. The Honor 200 Pro has a massive 42% discount. Not quite a flagship, this phone is powered by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 and has a curved 6.78” 1224p+ OLED display (10-bit, 120Hz, 4,000 nits) and a 5,200mAh Si/C battery with 100W wired and 66W wireless charging. The camera starts off great with a 50MP main with a large 1/1.3” sensor (and OIS), then comes a 50MP 2.5x telephoto module (OIS) and a 12MP ultra-wide. The pill-shaped punch hole on the front is home to a 50MP selfie camera and a depth sensor. That’s a lot of hardware for a mid-range price. Priced slightly lower is the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ 5G. This one is based on the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip and also has a curved OLED display – a 6.67” 1220p+ panel with 12-bit colors (Dolby Vision, 3,000 nits). Its claim to fame is the 120W wired fast charging for the 5,110mAh battery. If you don’t need 100+ watt charging, the Redmi Note 14 Pro 5G is a good deal cheaper and has mostly the same hardware but with 45W charging for the 5,110mAh battery. The only other notable difference is the chipset, a Dimensity 7300 Ultra. That said, the display is the same and so are the rear cameras – the 200MP main (1/1.4”, OIS) and 8MP ultra-wide. The selfie cameras are slightly different, both have 20MP sensors but the Pro+ phone has a wider lens (21mm vs. 25mm). The Nothing Phone (2a) is getting ready for retirement. Priced almost on par with the Redmi Note 14 Pro, it features a comparable Dimensity 7200 Pro chipset and a 5,000mAh battery with 45W charging. The main camera has only a 50MP sensor (1/1.56”, OIS), but the ultra-wide is better with a 50MP sensor of its own (that’s a flagship-level UW camera for some brands). And, of course, the unique Glyph interface. As a reminder, Nothing will unveil the Phone (3a) series in March. The Motorola Moto G85 is powered by the Snapdragon 6s Gen 3 chipset with a whopping 12GB of RAM and 256GB storage (UFS 2.2, but it is expandable via microSD). Despite being the cheapest model on the list, this phone has a curved 6.67” OLED display (1080p+, 120Hz, 10-bit). The cameras include a 50MP main (small 1/1.95” sensor, OIS) and an 8MP ultra wide, plus a 32MP selfie camera (video is capped at 1080p @ 30fps). The 5,000mAh battery charges at 30W.
