These Pre-Order Deals will Save You a Ton In comparison to the standard Galaxy S25 model, the S25 Edge will feature a dual-camera setup, in addition to its thinner build. It will presumably come with the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset as on the main trio, although it shouldn’t be too surprising if Samsung shaves down other specs such as battery capacity, storage, and such. Samsung adds that the Galaxy S25 Edge will come later in the year, and we might see it launch earlier than Apple’s rumored iPhone Air, which will likewise come with a slim design.",
