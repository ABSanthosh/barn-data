The solid aluminum unibody is shockproof and has been tested to survive drops of up to six feet. If you care about security, you can also protect it with an AES 256-bit encrypted password.Samsung’s portable SSDs are great, and this one is among the industry’s top choices, so take advantage of the deal while you can. This is the cheapest we’ve seen it go for in a long time!",
