Launched back in 2003, Microsoft acquired Skype later on in 2011 to replace Windows Live Messenger. READ: Google Messages Might Integrate a WhatsApp Feature Soon Microsoft says that is retiring Skype in order to focus on Microsoft Teams, its alternative video conferencing service. Skype will remain active until May 5 2025, although Teams users will be able to connect with Skype users during the transition phase. Part of the company’s official statement reads: In order to streamline our free consumer communications offerings so we can more easily adapt to customer needs, we will be retiring Skype in May 2025 to focus on Microsoft Teams (free), our modern communications and collaboration hub. With Teams, users have access to many of the same core features they use in Skype, such as one-on-one calls and group calls, messaging, and file sharing. Additionally, Teams offers enhanced features like hosting meetings, managing calendars, and building and joining communities for free. Microsoft adds that Skype users can move to Teams for free, and export their Skype data including chats, contacts, and call history. Last year, Microsoft announced that it will remove ads from Skype altogether, although it did not hint an impending shutdown of the service.
