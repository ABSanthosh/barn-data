Nothing started off making midrange phones, and then after some time, added budget options to its portfolio. However, it has never touched the flagship field, at least until this year. The company has made it clear that its next device, the Nothing Phone 3, is going to be a true flagship, and that's an exciting thought. The phone is expected to launch in July, and leading up to that, expect the OEM to continue to trickle out hints about the phone. Today, it has done that, and this time, it's not exactly good news. One of the most recognizable Nothing features will be done away with, but I think there's a catch. Let's dive into what we know and what we think. Nothing Will Get Rid of Its Iconic Glyph Interface for the Phone 3 Image: Nothing When the very first Nothing smartphone was revealed to the world, I'd argue that beyond the transparent back panel, the most iconic thing about it was the set of LEDs on the back. The company calls it the Glyph interface, and it has been on every Nothing Phone released to date. It's a staple of the experience as a Nothing user, giving you an indicator for notifications, charging, and other features. If you've fallen in love with the feature, now is the time to fall out of love. Nothing has confirmed via its X account that the Nothing Phone 3 simply won't have the Glyph LED lights on the back. Image: Nothing I don't think that will serve as a dealbreaker for anyone, because there's a lot that the Glyph interface does that an always-on display can do just as well. In a way, it was just a well-received gimmick in a smartphone market that was starting to get a little too boring. Removing it will make the device less unique, though I'm sure whatever Nothing has prepared for the Nothing Phone 3 will still be special, in an entirely new fashion. The Glyph Lights Could Potentially Be Replaced By a Dot Matrix Image: Nothing Here's the thing: if Nothing itself is coming to confirm that it is killing one of its most iconic features, there definitely has to be more to the story than that. If the OEM's intent was to turn the back of the phone into a regular back panel, just like every other manufacturer, it would be unnecessary bad press. Instead, I think that the company has something else planned to replace the iconic Glyph lights, and I'm sure that in the OEM's opinion, what it has cooking up is superior. I think the answer is a dot matrix, and I'm going to explain exactly why. Take a look at the post below. Nothing has always embraced simplicity in its typographical choices, but in this case, I think it says a lot more than you might expect. I think the pixel-style dots that make up the “3” in the video are a clever hint that the OEM is planning along those lines. A dot matrix can light up, and it can draw out words and icons, which makes it several times more useful than a few LEDs. If this pans out, I don't think anyone will hate it. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
