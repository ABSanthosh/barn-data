T-Mobile is never shy about throwing various perks and offers your way. As a brand, it's entire T-Mobile Tuesdays program is about giving you stuff for free or at a major discount. It's not that other carriers don't find ways to give you offers, deals, and freebies, but T-Mobile might be the only one that's so structured about it. Speaking of freebies, if you're a big fan of the sport of baseball, then you're going to like what the carrier has prepped for you for next month. You'll get the chance to snag a free subscription to MLB.TV for yourself, covering the entire season. That's a pretty sweet deal for those who are eagerly anticipating baseball season. T-Mobile Will Give You the Chance to Grab a Season's-Worth of MLB.TV Next Month Image: MLB When you hop onto one of the big three carriers, the only thing that you're owed is good service when it comes to calls, texts, and the internet. However, it has essentially become standard to expect a lot more, which is great for the consumer. Now, you can expect to see perks like international roaming, free calls and texts to other territories, and more. One of those “more” includes perks and deals involving third-party services. In today's episode of T-Mobile throwing offers and deals at you, the focus is on baseball. No, this time, it isn't a physical freebie like a baseball cap or an actual baseball. This time, it's a subscription to MLB.TV, the official streaming service of Major League Baseball, which gives you access to pretty much every single game of the season. Image: MLB If you're an avid baseball fan, then I'm sure that you know that the regular season is yet to start—one will have to wait until March 27th for that. Fortunately, two days before that, on March 25th, you will have the chance to snag a free subscription to MLB.TV through the T-Life app. That window will only remain open for about a week—until March 31st—so you're going to have to move fast if you really love the sport. Keep in mind that this isn't the kind of freebie to turn your nose up at. It's worth $150, which is a lot of money to have waived. If you don't care too much about baseball, that's one thing, but if you do, don't let this one slide past you. Set your calendars for March 25th. Don't Forget About T-Mobile's Similar Offer for MLS, Ending March 4th Image: T-Mobile If soccer is more your speed, then you're in luck. T-Mobile is offering a similar perk for the MLS season. The MLS Season Pass is available via Apple TV, and up until March 4th, you have the chance to redeem this limited-time deal. Similar to the MLB plan, you'll get access to the entire MLS season for free. This would normally be $99, but now, it is free, and it's hard to argue that this isn't one of the tastier deals the carrier will offer this year.
