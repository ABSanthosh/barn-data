  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account For years now, Samsung has coasted on refinements, with many voicing their opinions on the matter, sharing how boring things have gotten with its phones. But despite this, it hasn't stopped the brand from achieving sales success, selling millions of phones each year. Of course, we'd love to see Samsung try some new and exciting things, and it appears that we might actually get that this year with its foldables. Related While we have yet to get official word about a release, early intel indicates that new foldables from the brand could be announced on July 9. We've been seeing renders over the past few months, but a new video shows off a dummy model of the Galaxy Z Fold 7. This video offers our clearest look yet at the upcoming phone, showing off just how sleek and thin it really is. This could be the foldable we've been waiting for The video comes to us from the YouTube channel 더신자 TheSINZA, showing off a dummy model of the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 (via SammyGuru). Now, what's interesting is, not only do we get the physical dimensions of the dummy model, but the YouTube channel also shows comparisons to other Samsung phones as well, to give us a better idea of its physical proportions. The Z Fold 7 could end up being the lightest foldable the brand has ever released, coming in at just 215 grams. In addition, the phone could also be the thinnest one from the brand that we've seen as well, coming in at just 4.54mm when unfolded. It's also important to note that there could be some improvements to the display and its crease as well. But if there is one part of the phone that might disappoint, it's the fact that the new model could arrive with a hole-punch camera in the display. Naturally, the position of this isn't quite clear at this point, and could be in the center or the corner, but at the very least, the current information suggests that the phone will not have an Under Display Camera (UDC). Naturally, since this is a dummy model, there is always the chance that some of the details could be off. Luckily, we won't have to wait long to find out — if the phone is set to make its debut next month. In addition to the Z Fold 7, Samsung is also rumored to be working on a new Z Flip 7 with an improved front display, along with new wearables as well with its Galaxy Watch 8 lineup. For the most part, this upcoming event could host the most exciting products released by Samsung in quite some time. And if all of that wasn't enough, we've also been hearing rumors that Samsung has something special in store with a foldable that tops all other foldables. We'll just have to wait and find out.",

We\u0026#39;ve been seeing renders over the past few months, but a new video shows off a dummy model of the Galaxy Z Fold 7. This video offers our clearest look yet at the upcoming phone, showing off just how sleek and thin it really is. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"this-could-be-the-foldable-we-39-ve-been-waiting-for\"\u003e\n                        This could be the foldable we\u0026#39;ve been waiting for\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n\u003cp\u003eThe video comes to us from the YouTube channel \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFcetSB8Sf8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e더신자 TheSINZA\u003c/a\u003e, showing off a dummy model of the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 (via \u003ca href=\"https://sammyguru.com/dummy-galaxy-z-fold-7-gives-us-a-glimpse-of-whats-coming/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSammyGuru\u003c/a\u003e). Now, what\u0026#39;s interesting is, not only do we get the physical dimensions of the dummy model, but the YouTube channel also shows comparisons to other Samsung phones as well, to give us a better idea of its physical proportions. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe Z Fold 7 could end up being the lightest foldable the brand has ever released, coming in at just 215 grams. In addition, the phone could also be the thinnest one from the brand that we\u0026#39;ve seen as well, coming in at just 4.54mm when unfolded. It\u0026#39;s also important to note that there could be some improvements to the display and its crease as well. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eBut if there is one part of the phone that might disappoint, it\u0026#39;s the fact that the new model could arrive with a hole-punch camera in the display.
