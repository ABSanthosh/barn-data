Not everyone likes phones with big screens, and that's understandable. The only thing is that small flagship phones have slowly become extinct, especially if you like devices with screens under six inches. These days, a small device is considered to be one with a screen size of 6.2 or 6.3 inches. It is essentially impossible to find anything smaller. OnePlus is planning to enter the small phone market, though it won't subvert the trend regarding screen size. However, it will make good use of the space it has, as we're hearing that the OnePlus 13 Mini, or 13T, as it might end up being called, could have a massive 6,000mAh battery inside. A Mini Flagship Model Could Join the OnePlus 13 Family Image: OnePlus The OnePlus 13 launched in China in October last year and only just made its way to the United States and other regions in January of this year—in fact, it was the first major smartphone release of the year. The OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R are arguably some of the best flagship phones that are available in 2025 so far, but it looks like the magic of the 13 series isn't going to end just yet. For those who like smaller devices, the OnePlus 13 lineup isn't that inclusive. Both devices sit right up top, near the upper limit of screen sizes for regular bar phones, making it hard for those who like compact smartphones to fall in love. That's why it's great to hear that OnePlus seems to be gearing up to launch a compact flagship phone, just like other Chinese OEMs have been doing. Image: OnePlus Similar to those, the device will come with a 6.3-inch display. These days, it is essentially impossible to find a smartphone that goes under the 6.2-inch mark, especially as bezels keep getting thinner and thinner. The phone is expected to be called either the OnePlus 13 Mini or the OnePlus 13T, the latter of which would be a nice callback to much earlier OnePlus days. The OnePlus 13 Mini Will Have a Massive 6,000mAh Battery Despite Its Size Image: OnePlus This upcoming OnePlus device might be small, but thanks to the magic of silicon-carbon battery technology, it looks like we can expect a shockingly large battery to follow it. A report from Digital Chat Station, a notoriously good tipster, points to a battery that will surpass the 6,000mAh mark. For a device that small, that'd be insane. For full reference, the much larger Galaxy S25 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro XL only manage to fit in 5,000mAh and 5,060mAh batteries, respectively. Compared to the similarly-sized Galaxy S25 and its 4,000mAh cell, OnePlus' mini device will have 50% more battery capacity. That's nothing to scoff at. Even beside the Vivo X200 Pro Mini, it will still outstrip its battery by at least 300mAh. Image: Vivo It won't compromise on performance where it matters either, as it is expected to come with the Snapdragon 8 Elite in the driver's seat. It seems like there are very few compromises those who like smaller phones will have to make with this one.
