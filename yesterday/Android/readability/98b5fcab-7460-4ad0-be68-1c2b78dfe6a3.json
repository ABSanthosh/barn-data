Of course, 128GB is the base storage for Google’s pricier Pixels, even the Pro XL, and the 9a is a good deal cheaper than those. At least for the past couple of generations of “a” models there is a 256GB option. Let’s do a recap of what people liked and what they didn’t about the Pixel 9a. Things in the positive column: it’s a petite phone with a clean look and a nearly flush camera island. Not so positive things: the thick bezels, slow chipset, slow charging and the smaller main camera sensor (1/2.0” vs. 1/1.73” in the 8a). Some people are interested in the Pixel 9a and their number can double with positive reviews – we have a test unit and we are putting it through its paces, so stay tuned for a detailed report. But the truth is that even more people can be attracted to the 9a if it gets a price cut. Which it will soon enough, Pixels are regularly featured in our weekly deals posts. However, there are plenty of excellent mid-rangers in this price segment and most of them offer better hardware – Pixel 9a’s advantages lie in its size and the Google experience with common Pixel Feature Drops. That’s it from the Google Pixel 9a for now, we will let you know once our review is done and if and when we find a good deal on the phone.
