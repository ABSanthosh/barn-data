  "text": "8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless Controller $26 $35 Save $9 The 8BitDo Ultimate 2C delivers premium features at an affordable price. It includes two extra remappable buttons for quick in-game commands and uses Hall Effect tech to prevent stick drift for smooth, precise control. It connects wirelessly to gaming PCs via a 2.4 GHz USB dongle and works seamlessly with Android devices and media players via Bluetooth. This is the game controller you need if you're looking to take your mobile gaming to a new level. 8BitDo has been making controllers for some years now, and has a refined lineup that really delivers when it comes to the look, feel, and performance. The 8BitDo Ultimate 2C has all the controls you'll ever need, and even manages to add a few extra features to ensure that you'll have a good experience. The best part is that it now comes at just $26, which is one of the lowest prices we've seen. Related Do you use a physical controller to play Android games? When it comes to Android games, we get a lot of ports on the Play Store. As a matter of fact, many of Android's best games are ports from consoles/PC. This is why I always recommend picking up a controller for Android. Be it something that attaches to your phone or wirelessly connects to your tablet, there is no shortage of choices to fit your specific needs. And sure, mobile gaming doesn't have the best reputation what with how many titles are aggressively monetized, but there are gems out there, and plenty of them excel with a controller in hand. So, do you own a controller that works with Android, and more importantly, do you use it? Hit the comments to share, as I am curious how many gamers around here game with controllers connected to their mobile. What's great about the 8BitDo Ultimate 2C game controller? Source: 8BitDo We've highlighted this game controller before, but this model is a little different from the usual versions, offering a theme that celebrates Black Myth: Wukong. You get small designs from the game here and there, along with a deep black color across most of the controller with small pops of red that completes the aesthetic perfectly. You can use this controller to connect to any Android device, and there's even a USB dongle included, so it can be used with a PC as well. When it comes to the controller, it features the usual controls, with analog sticks, D-pad, buttons, triggers, and shoulder buttons. There are also two customizable buttons on the rear too. The 8BitDo Ultimate 2C features a familiar design and great performance, and at this newly discounted price, it makes it an easy one to pick up. If you don't like the Black Myth: Wukong version, the pastel colors are also on sale for roughly the same price.",

\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to Android games, we get a lot of ports on the Play Store. As a matter of fact, many of Android\u0026#39;s best games are ports from consoles/PC. This is why I always recommend picking up a controller for Android. Be it something that attaches to your phone or wirelessly connects to your tablet, there is no shortage of choices to fit your specific needs. And sure, mobile gaming doesn\u0026#39;t have the best reputation what with how many titles are aggressively monetized, but there are gems out there, and plenty of them excel with a controller in hand.\n\nSo, do you own a controller that works with Android, and more importantly, do you use it?
