Let’s test that theory – Samsung’s slender flagship just got its first major discount. The 512GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is now under $1,000. Keep in mind that the MSRP of the base 256GB variant is $1,100, so you get more storage for less money. Would you be better off with a Samsung Galaxy S25+? Check out our Galaxy S25+ vs. S25 Edge article for our thoughts on the matter. The S25+ has better battery life, though the gaming test is where most of its advantage comes from – for web browsing and especially video streaming, the S25 Edge comes pretty close. Of course, the S25+ is cheaper but not by much right now – the 512GB models are only $70 apart. Speaking of gaming, the new RedMagic 10S Pro is in the same price range. This one boasts a rectangular 6.85” 144Hz OLED display with an UD camera. It’s powered by an actively-cooled Snapdragon 8 Elite, though our testing shows that the fan doesn’t do much. Even without it, the 10S Pro is one of the fastest Androids around. Switching over to the accessories section, the Samsung Galaxy Watch7 is under $200 for the 40mm model. That puts it on par with the Watch FE and the Watch7 is better in every way. Plus, the FE is available only in 40mm size, while the Watch7 does have a 44mm option for $45 more. For an adventure-ready watch, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra also has a hefty discount. This one is available only in 47mm size and it has LTE connectivity (which is optional on the Watch7).
