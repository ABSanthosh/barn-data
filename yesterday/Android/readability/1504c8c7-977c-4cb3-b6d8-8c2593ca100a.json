One alternative to get the functionality of a smart TV though is by getting an add-on that will allow your TV to access services such as Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and more. As such, Amazon’s Fire TV Stick is a great option for people looking to do just that. Easy to set-up, the Fire TV Stick’s plug-and-play feature lets you access an insane amount of content from top streaming sites, and comes with movies and shows from Amazon as well, all in Full HD resolution. One thing to note though is that you will need Wi-Fi, an HMDI port on your TV, and a power outlet. You can grab the Fire TV Stick for a super low price right now using the link below.
