  "text": "The Poco F7 launched earlier this week and it comes with a discount right out of the gate. But how does it compare against the other F7 models? The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge has also gotten a price cut. The Poco F7 is powered by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 and a large 6,500mAh battery. The chipset comes very close to the performance of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 inside the F7 Pro, though the phone can heat up to unpleasant levels during long gaming sessions. 90W wired-only charging is supported. The Poco F7 Pro is £80 more than the vanilla model. It has a smaller display (6.67” vs. 6.83”), but it is sharper (1440p+ vs. 1280p+). The battery is smaller too at 6,000mAh. Both phones have metal frames and IP68 ratings. While the 50+8MP camera setups look the same at first glance, note that the Pro has a larger sensor in the main (1/1.55” vs. 1/1.95”) and can record 8K video (both can do 4K @ 60fps, though, which is more important). The Poco F7 Ultra is a flagship model with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, which offers significantly more performance (though it throttles worse than average under sustained load). It’s not just the chipset, this model also has a telephoto camera (50MP 1/2.76” sensor, 2.5x/60mm f/2.0 lens with OIS) and a higher resolution 32MP ultra-wide. The battery is relatively small at 5,300mAh, but it supports both 120W wired and 50W wireless charging. For more on the Poco F7 Pro vs. F7 Ultra check out our dedicated article. Going back to the vanilla F7, the Poco X7 Pro is a cheaper alternative at £80 less. It has a smaller 6.67” display and a smaller 6,000mAh battery (90W charging). It’s rated IP68/IP69, however, the frame is plastic. The Dimensity 8400 Ultra chipset comes pretty close to the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, even in graphics tests. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge was quite pricey at launch, but the good news for people who want slim and light phones is that the price is already falling. You can pick up a 512GB model for £1,100 and you can subtract £100 from that if you have a Prime or Prime Student subscription. Or you can just buy a Samsung Galaxy S25+. In our Galaxy S25+ vs. S25 Edge comparison we note that the Plus has better battery life, but the Edge feels more premium and offers comparable camera performance. If you care about the camera, you really should be looking at the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra – it’s £100 more expensive if you want 512GB storage. The Ultra is a lot heavier (218g vs. 163g), but it has two more telephoto cameras than the Edge (which has none). We have a detailed Galaxy S25 Edge vs. S25 Ultra comparison for a more detailed look at the pros and cons. We may get a commission from qualifying sales.",
