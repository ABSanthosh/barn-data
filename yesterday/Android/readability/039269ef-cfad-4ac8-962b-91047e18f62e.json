Very recently, Visible, the MVNO owned by Verizon, announced it was adding a third prepaid plan to its portfolio. It's called Visible+ Pro, and it amps up on the things that you get with the regular Visible+ plan, making it perfect for those who need faster speeds and a few extra features here and there. Today, Visible announced a new perk to make its Visible+ Pro plan even more worth it, and that's the opportunity to score free tickets to music festivals and sporting events, simply by being a subscriber on the new plan. That's not bad, but there are a few things you need to know before you get too excited, so let's talk about those. Visible+ Pro Throws in Free Event Tickets as a Perk for Being on the Plan Image: Visible All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, and that has been echoed for decades now. In fact, most of us know from actual life that saying has a lot more validity than we might have initially given it credit for. As much as you work hard to earn money and afford the things you need and want, it is important for you to be able to kick back and relax on occasion. It's hard to disagree with that unless you're a workaholic. Visible by Verizon knows this, and is prepared to give you a chance to have fun and relax. The carrier recently unveiled a third prepaid plan, called Visible+ Pro. That plan comes with a whole bunch of stuff to make it more appealing to those with premium needs, and now, we know yet another thing that will set it apart from the other plans. You will get the chance to score free tickets to music festivals and sporting events. Image: Visible If you're a music person, you'll get the chance to enjoy music festivals like EDC Las Vegas, The Governors Ball, BottleRock Napa Valley Music Festival, and more. Or if you're into sports, the New Jersey Devils' game on April 16th, the Indycar Sonsio Grand Prix, and even the Indy 500 in May. That value for simply being a customer is immense. What Do I Need to Do to Claim Free Tickets From Visible? Now, you know that the perk exists, but the big question is what you actually have to do to make sure that you can claim these tickets when the time comes. Good question. Well, first off, from today, April 14th, to April 24th, each day will have a limited number of tickets for a new event up for grabs for Visible+ Pro users. The previous image will give you a look at the events and corresponding dates. Image: Visible If you've seen one you want to grab hold of, you need to make sure that you're signed up for the new Visible+ Pro plan, whether you're a new or existing customer. Once that's done, visit enterpromo.com/visible on the appropriate date, enter your details, and provide your Visible+ Pro plan order number as proof that you're on the plan. From there, you have to cross your fingers and hope you were quick enough to get a ticket. The supply is limited and it is on a first-come, first-served basis, so it is all about speed. Also, keep in mind that while there's no limit to how many times you can submit, you can only receive tickets for one event—so don't waste your one try on an event ticket that you don't really want.
