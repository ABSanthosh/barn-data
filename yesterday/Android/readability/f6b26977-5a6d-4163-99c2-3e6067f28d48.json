We then have the upcoming Sony Xperia 1 VII in fourth - the company may not sell that many smartphones these days, but you guys are still following its products closely. Xiaomi's Poco X7 Pro sits in fifth, ahead of the OnePlus 13T and the CMF Phone 2 Pro, which we just reviewed. Eighth position goes to the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max, followed by another Samsung phone. The Galaxy F56 is not going to enjoy global availability, which explains why even in its debut week it couldn't get higher on our chart. The final spot is for the Motorola Edge 60 Pro, which lost a lot of ground, but still made it to yet another edition of the top 10.",
