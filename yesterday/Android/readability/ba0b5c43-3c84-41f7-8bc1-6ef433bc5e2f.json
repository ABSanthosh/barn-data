We have the 41mm option, which is a better fit for smaller wrists. The 316L stainless steel body can still handle 5 ATM pressure and is IP69K-certified against water and dust. The upgrades include new antennas and improved positioning algorithms increase route accuracy by 40%, while distance and pace accuracy improve by 30% and 20%, respectively. The Watch GT 5 also comes with Huawei's new TruSense health-tracking system. It enhances the Sleep Breathing Awareness feature with Sleep Apnea Detection. People in countries outside the EU can also record their emotions to track their emotional well-being too. Stay tuned for the full review to see how the new features work in the real world and whether Huawei improved the user experience further.",
