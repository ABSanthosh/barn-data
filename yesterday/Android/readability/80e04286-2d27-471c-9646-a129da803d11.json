The device in question, with the model number A059, is most likely the Nothing Phone (3a), since it's been spotted in an IMEI database alongside an A059P - the \"P\" stands for \"plus\" in Nothing's nomenclature, so that one will be the Nothing Phone (3a) Plus. The third device has the model number A001, also revealed by the same IMEI database, and there is a small chance this could be the Nothing Phone (3), even though it's more likely to be the CMF Phone 2. Nothing Phone (2a) PlusNow, let's go back to the Phone (3a). This will use the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset, according to the aforementioned benchmark. This would be an interesting supplier switch for the London-based company, as the Nothing Phone (2a) uses MediaTek's Dimensity 7200 Pro instead. On the other hand, the Phone (2a) Plus went with the Dimensity 7350 Pro, so it looks like we should be expecting a slight upgrade in terms of SoC for the (3a) Plus as well. Speaking of chips, the CMF Phone 2 is also rumored to come with the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3. That's all we know about these so far, but of course we can speculate that they will all launch with Android 15 on board. The Phone (2a) was made official in March, so its successor's launch could be coming within the next 2-3 months. In case you're wondering about the Nothing Phone (3), so are we. This year Nothing decided not to release a high-end device, but it did say it would eventually come out with one in 2025. Perhaps the Phone (3) will arrive in the second half of next year. We'll let you know when we find out more. Via",
