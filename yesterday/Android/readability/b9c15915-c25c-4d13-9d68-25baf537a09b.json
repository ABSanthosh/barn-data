  "text": "Edgar Cervantes / Android AuthorityRobot vacuums have seen exponential growth in features and capabilities in just a few years, going from simple vacuums that were decent to incredibly capable, powerful, and self-sufficient products that not only keep your house spotless but also clean themselves. Narwal, a leading international smart home cleaning brand, has been at the forefront of this innovation and growth, releasing devices with industry-first features like the Auto-washing mop, AI-powered DirtSense™, and the Zero-Tangle System.Not one to rest on its laurels, Narwal continues to push the limit and set the standard in the field with its latest flagship robot vacuum, the Narwal Flow. Along with its other new releases, including the Freo Z10, Freo Pro, and the S30, Narwal has something for everyone. Here’s everything you need to know!Narwal Flow: The latest flagship takes automated home cleaning to the next levelEdgar Cervantes / Android AuthorityEvery time you think robot vacuums have reached their peak, Narwal comes by to raise the bar once again. That’s exactly what the company has done with its most powerful flagship yet, the Narwal Flow. With incredible power and a slew of industry-firsts like the FlowWash Mopping System and Deep Carpet Boost, the Flow is an advanced all-in-one cleaning solution that completely automates your home cleaning experience. These features include:FlowWash Mopping System with EdgeReach Technology Mops on traditional robot vacuums tend to get dirty quite quickly, especially when dealing with tough stains. In some cases, you need to manually clean the mop to make sure it doesn’t track these stains to other parts of the floor, while more advanced robots return to the base station to clean the mop before continuing to clean. Narwal addresses both these inefficient pain points with the new and innovative FlowWash Mopping System.The highlight of this system is that the robot now carries both fresh and dirty water tanks for real-time self-cleaning. The constant circulation ensures that the mop is clean and always uses fresh water to not only efficiently remove dirt but also prevent dirt and stains from spreading to other areas of the house.The Narwal Flow also uses a track mop with EdgeReach technology, which basically means that the mop can extend to reach edges and hard-to-clean areas with ease. Compared to the competition, the Narwal Flow’s track mop provides larger cleaning coverage and eliminates any cleaning gaps that usually occur when using robots with rounded mops.The mop also rotates counterclockwise, in the opposite direction of the robot’s movement, to provide complete surface contact. This pushes debris forward to ensure it doesn’t miss any dirt or debris. Combined with the FlowWash system, which provides continuous fresh water, the Narwal Flow has no trouble handling the toughest stains.Deep Carpet Boost and Zero-tangling cleaningEdgar Cervantes / Android AuthorityAnother industry-first feature addition from Narwal is the innovative deep carpet boost feature. When the Flow detects a carpet, the brush cover automatically moves closer to the ground to create a high-pressure air zone that lifts more dust. The robot also moves forward and backward to ensure the roller brush picks up all dust and debris, essentially doubling the dust pickup rate for deep carpet cleaning.Anyone with a pet knows the pain of continuously stopping and detangling the roller brush on their robot vacuums. Narwal fixes this major issue with a zero-percent tangling roller brush that uses a conical design with angled bristles and rubber strips. This design significantly reduces hair wrapping and guides and ejects hair directly into the suction port to prevent tangling.Similarly, you also get dynamic zero-tangling side brushes that move in a “detangle” motion to release caught hair and guide it straight to the air intake for quick disposal. Speaking of side brushes, it features two bristles, with a movable bristle that’s longer than the fixed one. The two are angled apart and work together to provide a more thorough clean. At corners, the movable bristle aligns with the fixed one for increased reach and better corner cleaning.With a whopping 20,000 Pa suction power, the Narwal Flow can handle any dust, debris, and deep carpet cleaning with ease.Twin-AI Dodged Obstacle Avoidance The Narwal Flow comes with an autonomous driving-level AI chip with an industry-leading 10 TOPS of computing power, so you’re getting cutting-edge technology for smart and efficient home cleaning. With dual RGB HD cameras, the robot can recognize up to 200 objects in real-time, allowing for intelligent path creation and obstacle avoidance.It smartly avoids socks, wires, and other obstacles while cleaning less than 1cm around objects, ensuring a thorough clean. The robot also makes real-time cleaning decisions and automatically adjusts the suction power to account for different types of messes.8-in-1 Multifunction base stationEdgar Cervantes / Android AuthorityRounding out its many selling points, the Narwal Flow comes with an 8-in-1 base station that automatically empties dust, washes and dries the mop, cleans the dock, dispenses detergent, refills the water tank, and, of course, charges the robot. A large 2.5L dust bag ensures up to 120 days of hands-free maintenance for a truly automated home cleaning experience.The Narwal Flow will be available in mid-2025.Narwal Freo Z10 – A premium all-in-one home cleaning solution The Narwal Freo Z10 continues to bring important upgrades to the Freo series. While the Flow Z10 is the new flagship, the Freo Z10 is an excellent option for anyone looking for a hands-free cleaning and maintenance experience. The Freo Z10 is packed with a slew of high-end features that make it worth a look. These include: Tangle-free cleaning: The Freo Z10’s side and roller brushes are all designed to prevent hair tangles, ensuring you don’t have to worry about the robot stopping mid-clean. With an impressive 15,000 Pa of suction power, pet hair and other debris won’t get in the way of the Z10. Mop extension for precise-edge cleaning: The Freo Z10 has extending mops that rotate at 180 RPM and can apply 8N of downward pressure to provide spotless cleaning near corners, sideboards, and difficult-to-reach areas. 7-in-1 base station: The Freo Z10 comes with a 7-in-1 base station that can automatically empty the dustbin, clean the mop, and sterilize the base to provide up to 120 days of maintenance-free use. This includes an AI-adaptive hot water mop washing feature that automatically adjusts the water temperature from 113°F to 167°F for optimal cleaning. The Narwal Freo Z10 will be available in April 2025, priced at $1,099. Narwal Freo Pro – The affordable alternative The Narwal Freo Pro may be the affordable option in the company’s robot vacuum lineup, but it packs plenty of high-end features that are more than enough for most households while helping you save a decent chunk of money. These features include: Powerful, tangle-free cleaning: The Freo Pro has 8,500 Pa of suction power, which is more than enough to handle most dust and debris easily. Its side and roller brushes have a tangle-free design that is 99.9% effective in preventing tangles. Reuleaux triangular mop pods: Like its older-generation siblings, the Freo Pro retains uniquely designed mop pads to provide gapless cleaning. With 12N of downward pressure and DirtSense™ Technology, it handles tough stains and provides deep, streak-free cleaning. Self-sufficient base station: The Freo Pro’s all-in-one base station offers automatic mop washing, drying, and dust processing for up to seven weeks of hands-free maintenance. The Freo Pro will launch in March 2025, priced at just $699. Narwal S30 – The new flagship handheld vacuum mop Even if you prefer cleaning your house yourself, there’s no reason why technology can’t help make the process far more efficient, quicker, and better. That’s exactly what you get with the Narwal S30. Building on the features of its predecessor, the S30 takes handheld vacuum mops to the next level. These include: All-in-one vacuum and mop: The Narwal S30 vacuums and mops in a single pass, which not only makes it easy to tackle heavy messes but also makes cleaning far less time-consuming. Dual defense against hair tangling: It also comes with dual-comb hair removal technology and auto hair-cutting features to prevent tangling, which is ideal for households with pets. User-friendly design: The Narwal S30’s design allows it to lie flat at 180°, making it very easy to reach under tables and furniture. You also get an informative LCD panel and voice prompts to let you know about battery levels, cleaning modes, and more. Self-cleaning features: Once docked, the dock utilizes 194°F smart iron drying technology to prevent odors, mold, and bacteria. Multiple cleaning modes: The Narwal S30 has six cleaning modes with DirtSense™ to customize the cleaning experience for various floor types and mess levels. With an impressive 20,000 Pa of suction power, the same as the Narwal Flow, and 20N of downward pressure with the mop, the S30 can handle any mess. The Narwal S30 will launch in Q2 2025, priced at $649.Find out more about Narwal’s exciting new releases at CES 2025.",
