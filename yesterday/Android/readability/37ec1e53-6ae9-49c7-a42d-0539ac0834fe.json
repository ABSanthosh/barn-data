More importantly it’s also on sale at the moment, going for around 19% off via Amazon, making it a bit more affordable thanks to this deal. In terms of what you get with the Galaxy A35, the phone comes with a large 6.6-inch display, up to 128GB of storage (with micro SD card support), 6GB of RAM, and access to all your favourite Android apps and software features. It also comes with an IP67 rating, keeping it safe from light splashes and dusty scenarios. You can check it out using the link below.
