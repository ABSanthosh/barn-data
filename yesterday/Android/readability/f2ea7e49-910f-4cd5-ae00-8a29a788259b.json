READ: HMD to Scale Back its North American Operations Speaking to the folks over at Tech Radar, Google’s President of Android Ecosystem Sameer Samat stated that he was interested in how users went about with their computers. He comments: …we’re going to be combining ChromeOS and Android into a single platform, and I am very interested in how people are using their laptops these days and what they’re getting done, Not much else was revealed about the suspected unification project specifically, but this new development ties in to what Google’s been doing with Android over the past few years, especially when it comes to refining the OS for much larger displays such as tablets and foldables. This also raises some questions as to what Google’s plans are for larger devices, especially considering that it’s barely said anything about the Pixel Tablet over the past couple of years, and has even stopped manufacturing and selling its own line of Chromebooks. Google’s latest major platform launch was Android 16, although as of the moment its still working on its big visual overhaul, which wasn’t available during Android 16’s debut.",
