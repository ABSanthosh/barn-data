  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary The latest Samsung SmartThings update allows broadcasting voice messages to connected smart speakers. New automation tools sync with Samsung Health for sci-fi-like routines. Support for Matter 1.4 and Calm Onboarding show us Samsung's vision for the future of the smart home. There's a new update for SmartThings and it brings some big changes. The standout feature? Users can now broadcast voice messages to speakers in their homes directly through the SmartThings app. Related Samsung announced the update on Tuesday. The company said the update is focused on smarter automation and better ways to keep families connected, and while it's not the first platform to offer announcements, this update brings SmartThings more in line with Alexa and Google Home. There are also new automation tools and integration with Samsung Health. Source: Samsung The latest update brings several quality-of-life improvements to the SmartThings app. It now connects with Samsung Health to create routines based on sleep and wake times, making sci-fi automations a reality. For example, if you use a Galaxy Watch or Galaxy Ring, SmartThings can automatically adjust lighting, open and close curtains, and change temperatures based on when you fall asleep or wake up. It measures temperatures, light, and CO2 levels to give you detailed sleep environment summaries. Routines are also expanded. You can now trigger automations on recurring schedules (weekly, monthly, or yearly) which makes it easier to set up birthday lights and holiday scenes. You can even auto-launch content on your TV based on your routines, such as news or the latest episode of Severance. The biggest update is the new broadcast feature. This lets you send custom messages through any SmartThings connected speaker, such as a Google Nest, Amazon Echo, or even an IKEA smart speaker. Simply use the app to play a message at home, like a reminder or a check-in with your kids. Calm onboarding for third-party devices The update brings support for Matter 1.4 and expands Calm Onboarding for third-party devices. While this greatly benefits Samsung's own ecosystem of connected home products such as refrigerators and televisions, it also allows for cross-platform usage. We saw some of this in action at CES earlier this year and came away impressed with Samsung's latest implementations of smart home technology. SmartThings is finally allowing Samsung to catch up to its vision for the future of homes.",

The company said the update is focused on smarter automation and better ways to keep families connected, and while it\u0026#39;s not the first platform to offer announcements, this update brings SmartThings more in line with Alexa and Google Home. There are also new automation tools and integration with Samsung Health. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-announces-latest-smartthings-update\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSamsung\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe latest update brings several quality-of-life improvements to the SmartThings app. It now connects with Samsung Health to create routines based on sleep and wake times, making sci-fi automations a reality. For example, if you use a Galaxy Watch or Galaxy Ring, SmartThings can automatically adjust lighting, open and close curtains, and change temperatures based on when you fall asleep or wake up. It measures temperatures, light, and CO2 levels to give you detailed sleep environment summaries. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eRoutines are also expanded. You can now trigger automations on recurring schedules (weekly, monthly, or yearly) which makes it easier to set up birthday lights and holiday scenes. You can even auto-launch content on your TV based on your routines, such as news or the latest episode of Severance. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe biggest update is the new broadcast feature. This lets you send custom messages through any SmartThings connected speaker, such as a Google Nest, Amazon Echo, or even an IKEA smart speaker. Simply use the app to play a message at home, like a reminder or a check-in with your kids. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch3 id=\"calm-onboarding-for-third-party-devices\"\u003e\n            Calm onboarding for third-party devices\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe update brings support for Matter 1.4 and expands Calm Onboarding for third-party devices. While this greatly benefits Samsung\u0026#39;s own ecosystem of connected home products such as refrigerators and televisions, it also allows for cross-platform usage. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWe saw some of this in \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-ces-smart-home-showcase/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eaction at CES\u003c/a\u003e earlier this year and came away impressed with Samsung\u0026#39;s latest implementations of smart home technology.
