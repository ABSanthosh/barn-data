  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account The Sphere in Las Vegas is a spectacle that has been making waves since it was first introduced back in 2023. The eye-catching exterior is a sight to behold on the Nevada skyline, while the massive interior screen provides a backdrop like no other. Related Since its opening, there have been a number of unique events, along with fantastic concerts to take advantage of the unique domed screen that spans the interior and exterior walls of the Sphere. And now it looks like Google is utilizing its AI magic in order to bring 'The Wizard of Oz' to life this summer. A new way to see an old classic While it's not clear what exactly 'The Wizard of Oz at Sphere' will entail, one can only imagine that viewers will be enveloped in the classic once they step into the venue. And as you can probably imagine, a project of this scale would have been impossible to create without the power of AI. And, of course, Google's Gemini is making some of this possible. Perhaps the most challenging work here is accommodating the old visuals in a way that stays true to the original but also properly stretches across the entire display nestled in the Sphere. For the most part, this is no small task, as the team is working with original material, which means an \"original four-by-three image on a 35mm piece of celluloid.\" Naturally, there were many directions that the various teams involved wanted to go, but it seemed like from the start that using CGI just wasn't an option and that AI would be necessary to complete this project. While there were lots of hurdles to overcome, it seems that 'The Wizard of Oz at Sphere' is going to be one of those summer events that you cannot ignore if you're in the area. However, don't get too excited because this experience is still months away, with Google sharing that it will make its debut on August 28, 2025. And if you want to give AI a try on your Android phone, just fire up Gemini to see all the things that it can do to enhance your experience.",

will entail, one can only imagine that viewers will be enveloped in the classic once they step into the venue. And as you can probably imagine, a project of this scale would have been impossible to create without the power of AI. And, of course, Google\u0026#39;s Gemini is making some of this possible. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the most challenging work here is accommodating the old visuals in a way that stays true to the original but also properly stretches across the entire display nestled in the Sphere. For the most part, this is no small task, as the team is working with original material, which means an \u0026#34;original four-by-three image on a 35mm piece of celluloid.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, there were many directions that the various teams involved wanted to go, but it seemed like from the start that using CGI just wasn\u0026#39;t an option and that AI would be necessary to complete this project. While there were lots of hurdles to overcome, it seems that \u0026#39;The Wizard of Oz at Sphere\u0026#39; is going to be one of those summer events that you cannot ignore if you\u0026#39;re in the area. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, don\u0026#39;t get too excited because this experience is still months away, with Google sharing that it will make its debut on August 28, 2025.
