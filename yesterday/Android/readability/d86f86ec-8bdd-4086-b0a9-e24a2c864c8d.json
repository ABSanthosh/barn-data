Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 combines \"Corning’s advanced glass technology with Samsung’s proprietary processing and reinforcement technologies\", Samsung says, helping the S25 Edge deliver \"a sleek yet strong design\". Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 has crystals \"intricately embedded within its glass matrix, enhancing the durability and crack deflection capabilities of the display cover\", according to the official press release, which goes on to say that \"the synergy between the glass and crystal components is engineered to provide improved toughness while retaining high optical transparency\". Corning's ion-exchange process further fortifies the glass ceramic material and \"improves retained strength of the display cover\". Kwangjin Bae, EVP and Head of the Mechanical R\u0026D Team of Mobile eXperience Business at Samsung Electronics, said: Galaxy S25 Edge will set a new standard for craftsmanship and performance as our slimmest Galaxy S series device yet. To support this breakthrough design, it was essential to develop a display material that was both exceptionally thin and reliably strong — a challenge that brought Corning and Samsung together, united by a shared vision for purposeful engineering and user-centric innovation. That vision is embedded in every detail of Galaxy S25 Edge. Andrew Beck, Vice President and General Manager, Corning Gorilla Glass, said: With Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2, we’ve achieved a remarkable combination of thinness and strength, giving consumers the best of both worlds — exceptional durability in a modern, sleek and premium design. The craftsmanship of Galaxy S25 Edge with Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 underscores Corning and Samsung’s commitment to meeting the evolving needs of consumers worldwide.",
