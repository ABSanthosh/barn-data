The Xiaomi 15 is not exactly tiny, but it is smaller than the majority of Androids, especially the high-end ones, which rarely dip below 6.7” displays. The Xiaomi 15 had a very positive reception that can only improve with strong reviews. There was a sentiment that the phone is too expensive (indeed, it costs a bit more than the Xiaomi 14 last year), but the overall impression is a good one.

The larger Xiaomi 15 Pro didn’t do as well – here there is a nearly even split between people who are already interested in the phone and those who want to see the reviews first before making up their mind. Price was an even bigger concern for the Pro model. Also, a not insignificant number of people are waiting for the inevitable Xiaomi 15 Ultra to arrive. Last year, Xiaomi announced that it had sold 1.45 million Xiaomi 14 phones just 10 days after the series launched in China. However, it never offered a breakdown of how well each model sold. Maybe the small 14 outsold the 14 Pro? And maybe it will happen again this year too, judging by the poll results.",
