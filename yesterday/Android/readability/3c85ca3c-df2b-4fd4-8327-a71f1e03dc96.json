  "text": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 series is expected to be unveiled later this month, but while everyone else waits for the preorder deals to go live, I just learned of an easy way to beat the crowds and save some cash today. Head to Samsung's website and sign up for the Galaxy Reserve program using just your name and email address and you'll be guaranteed to receive a $50 credit with your preorder, no strings attached. You're not under any obligation to buy anything and you can just unsubscribe once you apply your 50 bucks to your preorder. Yeah, it's that easy. To make the deal even sweeter, signing up for the Reserve program ahead of Samsung Unpacked on January 22nd will also enter you into a sweepstakes to win $5,000. You can even get up to $1,250 off the phones when you process a trade-in alongside your preorder. We don't know much else about preordering the Galaxy S25 just yet, but this seems like a pretty great start. Claim your $50 credit before Samsung Unpacked kicks offSamsung Galaxy S25 series: everything we know so farWe don't have a ton of official information just yet, but leaks and rumors over the past six months have suggested that the flagship series will include the base model Galaxy S25, the super-balanced Galaxy S25 Plus, and a newly-designed Galaxy S25 Ultra. There have also been rumors that a Galaxy S25 \"Slim\" variant will be revealed at some point.All the phones in the lineup are expected to come packed with the laptop-quality Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen Elite chipset, plus seven years of software support and Android 15 straight out of the box. As usual, you can also plan to see some upgraded camera tech and the latest AI-powered software features. Is the Galaxy S25 series destined to find its place among the best Android phones released in 2025? It's too soon to say, but I certainly wouldn't bet against it.  Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android After almost a decade of working in the e-commerce space, Patrick Farmer (he/him) began his career at Android Central as a Deals and Commerce Writer before moving into a new role as AC's eCommerce Editor in 2023.
