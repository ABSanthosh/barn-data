Speaking of wearables, Samsung’s affordable Galaxy Watch FE is currently on sale right now with a deal that brings down its price by as much 16% off. In terms of hardware, the Galaxy Watch FE is available in black, pink gold and silver, with an aluminum case that wraps around a 1.2-inch Super AMOLED touch display. As with most Wear OS devices, it also comes with 5ATM + IP68 certification for added water resistance. The device comes with Samsung’s own Exynos W920 chip, alongside 1.5GB RAM and 16GB of storage for apps. The Galaxy Watch FE also has a wealth of sensors onboard, which include a Samsung BioActive Sensor (Optical Heart Rate + Electrical Heart + Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis), Accelerometer, Barometer, Gyro Sensor, Geomagnetic Sensor, and a Light Sensor.
