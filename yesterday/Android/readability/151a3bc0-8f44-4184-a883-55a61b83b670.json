  "text": "Xiaomi recently took the wraps off its newest tablets, the Xiaomi Pad 7 and 7 Pro. Both tablets share a lot of similarities with each other, although a closer look reveals that there are some key differences between the two tablets. For one, Xiaomi has equipped the Pad 7 and 7 Pro with different chipsets – the Xiaomi Pad 7 comes with the Qualcomm 7+ Gen 3 chipset, while its Pro sibling runs on the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3. No Snapdragon 8 Elite action on here unfortunately, although given the price we really can’t complain. You see, for a starting price of around $280 for the base model, there are some decent specs onboard – both tablets come with an 11-inch LCD display with a resolution of 3200 x 2136 pixels, a 144Hz refresh rate, as well as a peak brightness of 800 nits. The Pad 7 Pro also packs a high-resolution 50MP main camera, which outsizes the 13MP shooter on the regular 7. Both tablets also start at 8GB of RAM, with varying storage options at 128 and 256GB, although the Pro model does have a 12GB + 512GB configuration available. Both have the same battery capacity however, with a 8,850 mAh battery inside, with 45W and 67W wired charging speeds for the 7 and 7 Pro, respectively. At the moment, both tablets are only available in China, although we should see them make their way to more markets soon enough. Source: GSMArena",
