  "text": "At Galaxy Unpacked, we shared how we’re bringing new Gemini and Circle to Search capabilities to Samsung’s latest device lineup, including the Galaxy Z Fold7, Z Flip7 and Watch8 series. Today at Galaxy Unpacked, we announced new updates to Google AI capabilities on Android, like Gemini and Circle to Search, that are available on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold7, Z Flip7 and Watch8 series. These will also be the first new devices to launch with Android 16 and Wear OS 6. Here’s a look at all the updates.1. AI Mode smarts and gaming help in Circle to SearchSince we launched Circle to Search on the Galaxy Unpacked stage last year, we’ve made it available on hundreds of millions of Android devices, and we’ve continued to add rich, new capabilities like on-screen translation and AI Overviews for more visual searches.Now, Circle to Search is about to get even more powerful with AI Mode 1 , our most advanced AI search experience for your toughest questions. On Android, long press on the home button or navigation bar, and circle something of interest to get an AI-powered response, then ask follow-up questions to get deeper insights about what you’re looking at. You’ll find simple breakdowns and helpful links to keep exploring.Try it out today with our latest capability: mobile gaming help. Circle the challenge, character or item on your screen, and get an AI Overview with tips, relevant videos timestamped to your spot in the game, and links to helpful articles to learn more. When you’re done, just resume gameplay right where you left off 2 . 2. Unfold new ways to share your screen and camera with GeminiOn the new Galaxy Z Fold7, long press the power button and share your screen with Gemini for effortless multitasking 3 . You can get live help as you scroll through content or switch apps — it’s perfect for getting a second opinion as you shop online. Say you’re deciding which suitcase to buy for your upcoming trip: Open Gemini Live, share your screen, scroll through the different products you’re considering and ask, “which one should I choose based on material quality?” When you need help with the world around you, the new Galaxy Z Flip7 is a perfect companion. Go Live, tap the camera button and flip to Flex Mode. Your Galaxy Z Flip7 becomes its own tripod, giving you hands-free pointers as you cut your own bangs, take on a DIY project or try to master your yoga form 4 .For the first time ever, we’re also bringing camera sharing with Gemini Live directly to the Galaxy Z Flip7 FlexWindow 5 . This is great for quick answers while you’re on the go, like last minute outfit advice or help styling a new pair of glasses, all without opening your phone. 3. Connect Gemini Live to your favorite Samsung appsWe recently started rolling out Gemini Live support for Google apps starting with Calendar, Tasks, Maps and Keep so you can take action and make plans directly from your conversations . Starting with the Galaxy Z Fold7 and Z Flip7, Gemini will also connect directly with your favorite Samsung apps like Samsung Calendar, Reminder and Notes 6 .See a poster for an event? Open Gemini Live, point your camera and simply ask, “Check if I’m free when they’re coming to town” or “Can you add these events to my Samsung Calendar?” Gemini takes care of it for you. 4. Access Gemini on your wrist with Galaxy Watch8The new Galaxy Watch8 is the first device to come with Wear OS 6, which means everything on your wrist feels faster than before. And you’ll also notice enhanced responsiveness and fluid scrolling with seamless transitions, making every interaction effortless.The Watch8 series is the first to come with Gemini 7 ready to go, right out of the box. In those moments when your phone isn’t handy, Gemini is all about providing you with answers, and helping you check things off your list. And thanks to Wear OS 6, Gemini also works with your go-to Samsung apps like Samsung Health, Calendar, Reminder and Clock.Gemini on your Watch8 is there for you throughout your day, from tracking your morning run, needing to remember a quick thought to share later or even helping you find a restaurant to try and sending details to a friend. Speaking naturally to your watch means you can get things done instantly, keeping your focus on what matters. All these powerful new AI features are ready for you now on your new Samsung Galaxy devices. Galaxy Z Fold7 and Flip7 will both come with 6 months of Google AI Pro, so you can get more access to Google's most capable model Gemini 2.5 Pro, and unlock new and powerful features like video generation with Veo 3 Fast.
