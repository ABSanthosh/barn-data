The brand hasn't revealed any of its specs yet, but does claim that it will have a long-lasting battery, ultra-fast charging, and some AI-powered camera features, of course. Today the K13x's box has been leaked ahead of its official unveiling, which is rumored to be coming by the end of this month (though Oppo hasn't yet issued invites). Along with the box, we also get an idea of what to expect in terms of pricing: the K13x will allegedly be under INR 15,000 in India. That makes perfect sense since this is going to be the successor to the K12x from last year, which launched at INR 12,999. It's still unclear if the K13x will receive a slight price hike or not, by the way. Unfortunately no specs have been outed for the K13x so far, even if it has already been certified and spotted in the Google Play Supported Devices list. So it's anyone's guess as to what it will bring to the table, but when we find out more about it, we'll let you know. One thing's for sure: it will join the already available Oppo K13 in the brand's roster in India. Oppo K12x These are the best offers from our affiliate partners.
