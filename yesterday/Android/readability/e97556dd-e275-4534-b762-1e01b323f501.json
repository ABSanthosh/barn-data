  "text": "With CES 2025 basically here, Samsung gave a sneak peek at its new lineup of monitors, which will be displayed during the event once it goes live in Las Vegas. The new 2025 lineup includes the Smart Monitor M9, Odyssey OLED G8 and G6, Odssey 3D, and the Viewfinity S8. First up is the Smart Monitor M9, which comes with a combination of on-device AI features – this includes AI Picture Optimizer which is able to automatically adjust settings to the type of content being displayed. It’s also capable of AI-based 4K upscaling to enhance low-resolution content during viewing, and packs hardware including a 32-inch 4K OLED screen and a built-in 4K camera. For gaming, there’s the Odyssey OLED G8 which is a 27-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor with a 3,840 x 2,160 resolution 240Hz display, and the Odyssey OLED G6 that packs a 500Hz refresh rate display and a QHD screen with a 2,560 x 1,440 pixel resolution. Both displays have a response time of 0.03ms, support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and NVIDIA G-Sync, and VESA DisplayHDR. Interestingly enough, Samsung’s gaming lineup also includes the 27-inch Odyssey 3D gaming monitor, which is designed with a lenticular lens attached to the front of the panel as well as a front stereo camera, allowing users to view content in 3D without the need for special glasses. There’s also the 37-inch ViewFinity S8, which according to Samsung packs an sRGB 99% color gamut and a sharp 4K resolution screen with 3,840 x 2,160 pixels. Samsung wasn’t too specific about the launch details, although it’s expected that the new monitors will hit the market not too far from now.",
