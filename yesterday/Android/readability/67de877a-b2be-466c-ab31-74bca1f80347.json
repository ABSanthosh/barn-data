  "text": "Apple Mac Mini (M4, 2024) $499 $599 Save $100 The all-new Mac mini is powered by Apple's M4 chip that packs incredible performance into an even smaller form factor of just 5 by 5 inches. This is the mini PC to get if you've been looking for one that can handle everything you throw at it. Grab it now for $100 less as it drops to one of its lowest prices yet. The Apple Mac Mini is one of the most powerful mini PCs that you can buy, handling pretty much everything you can throw at it with ease. The good news is that it doesn't cost all that much for the base model, coming in at just $599. The even better news is that you can now score a $100 discount, which brings it down to one of its best prices yet. So if you've been thinking about grabbing a mini PC and want to go all in with something new, the Mac Mini is going to be right up your alley. Related What's great about this Mac Mini? The great thing about the Mac Mini is that no matter what model you buy, you're getting tons of power thanks to Apple's powerful M4 chip. Despite this being the base model of the Mac Mini, you're getting 10 CPU and 10 GPU cores, along with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It doesn't sound like you're getting a whole lot here, but this thing can handle pretty much anything you throw at it. While doing your day-to-day things is a given here, you're also going to be able to step outside that with the ability to play games and even edit photos and videos. The only thing we'd recommend is adding more storage or RAM at the point of purchase, because you won't be able to upgrade this model later if you need more. However, you can always grab some external storage if space is a concern, which might be a cheaper way to go in the long run. Port selection is pretty good here too, with two USB-C, three Thunderbolt 4, HDMI, Ethernet, and a 3.5mm audio jack. You also get excellent wireless connectivity as well with support for Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. For the most part, you won't be left disappointed with the Mac Mini, so just get it while it's one sale so you can save.",

about the Mac Mini is that no matter what model you buy, you\u0026#39;re getting tons of power thanks to Apple\u0026#39;s powerful M4 chip. Despite this being the base model of the Mac Mini, you\u0026#39;re getting 10 CPU and 10 GPU cores, along with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It doesn\u0026#39;t sound like you\u0026#39;re getting a whole lot here, but this thing can handle pretty much anything you throw at it. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eWhile doing your day-to-day things is a given here, you\u0026#39;re also going to be able to step outside that with the ability to play games and even edit photos and videos. The only thing we\u0026#39;d recommend is adding more storage or RAM at the point of purchase, because you won\u0026#39;t be able to upgrade this model later if you need more. However, you can always \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/best-portable-ssd/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egrab some external storage\u003c/a\u003e if space is a concern, which might be a cheaper way to go in the long run. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003ePort selection is pretty good here too, with two USB-C, three Thunderbolt 4, HDMI, Ethernet, and a 3.5mm audio jack. You also get excellent wireless connectivity as well with support for Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. For the most part, you won\u0026#39;t be left disappointed with the Mac Mini, so just get it while it\u0026#39;s one sale so you can save. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
