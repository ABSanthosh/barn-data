  "text": "After nearly half a decade since the launch of the Xbox Series S|X, Microsoft has finally confirmed that it’s now working on its next-generation Xbox console, and is partnering with AMD to develop the hardware for the upcoming system. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Review (SAVE $400!) READ: Microsoft’s Xbox Handheld is Real, and Arrives Later this Year Nothing too detailed was announced by the company at the moment, although the company says that it’s continuing its work on both first-party hardware and cloud-based services. Microsoft adds that its next generation of consoles will come with “next-level performance, cutting-edge graphics, breakthrough gameplay, and unmatched compatibility.” Backwards-compatibility is also a priority, with the company outright stating that the future platform will work with users’ existing Xbox game libraries. As for its partnership with AMD, Microsoft states that it’s entered into a multi-year agreement with the company to develop hardware across different devices. Not too long ago, the company revealed that it’s partnered with ASUS to develop two handheld gaming devices—known as the ROG Xbox Ally series—which will launch later this year. Both handhelds are also powered by AMD’s Ryzen-series processors.",
