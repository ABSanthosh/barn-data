A lot can happen in a year, so it's super helpful how technology can make it possible to take a look over the events of the last twelve months. Platforms like Spotify popularized the whole “year-in-review” feature, but now, a lot more than just music services let you see how your year went. Even Duolingo neatly summarizes my year for me! It seems like Zynga didn't want to be left out of the fun of a yearly review, so they've brought a new feature to the popular Words With Friends game. Now, you'll be able to take a look at “Your Year In Words”, letting you see stats from your gameplay over the last year. Just Like “Wrapped”, Words With Friends Is Now Letting You Check Out “Your Year In Words” Image: Zynga We all have games that we can't let go of. For me, that's Candy Crush Soda Saga, but I know way too many people who have pitched their tents with Zynga's Words With Friends. They play several matches nearly every single day, and with all that gameplay, there's bound to be a whole lot of very interesting data collected on your words for the year. This is where we can thank the popularization of year-in-review features. Words With Friends has just released its own year-in-review, called Your Year in Words, for the very first time. This gives you the chance to view a personalized report generated from your gameplay during the year, showing you your very best moves, the most epic words you played, your highest scores, and so much more, all collected since January. It's Spotify Wrapped, except this time it is for your favorite word game. Image: Zynga And if you think that maybe you play a bit too much Words With Friends, you'll be able to confirm that through Your Year In Words. You get to see the total number of games you've played over the year and the total number of moves you made. And of course, you don't need to keep your impressive stats to yourself, as you can share them with your friends too. Words With Friends Will Be Celebrating The Most Viral Words Of 2024 Image: Zynga In addition, as the year comes to a close, Zynga has chosen to honor the most iconic words of the year. As we count down, Words With Friends will feature these iconic words as the Word of the Day. The best part is that we already know the five signature words of the year, and perhaps I'm chronically online, but I can point to what makes each of these particularly special in 2024. BRAT; Shoutout to Charli XCX's album that took the girls by storm this summer. DEMURE; That TikTok trend that started to drive me nuts before it came close to ending. Not demure, not mindful. HIPPO; The baby hippo Moo Deng, who else? BREAKDANCING; Don't forget the whole Australian breakdancing fiasco at this year's Olympics in Paris. YAPPING; A word that's been around for a long time, but experienced a particular surge of popularity thanks to social media. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
