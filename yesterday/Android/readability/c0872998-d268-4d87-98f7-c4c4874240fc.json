Thankfully, phone batteries are getting better, but that doesn't mean that the power they provide is always sufficient—that's why power banks are still a thing. Some phones have insanely fast charging that can juice a phone up from 0 to 100 in 10 minutes, but that's a tiny minority. If only there was some way to charge your phone instantly… Well, Swippitt feels like they have the answer to that, and they plan to do it with a home device that looks like a toaster. It's the Swippitt Hub and with a specially-designed case, you'll be able to get extra battery power swapped into your phone in a matter of seconds. Swippitt Shows Off Its Instant Power System at CES 2025 Image: Swippitt Think about it. Sometimes you're about to head out the door and you want to make sure that you have more than enough battery power left to survive the entire day. The problem is, you might not have enough time to charge up your phone—maybe you're about to dash out of the house to go to work or school. A new device called Swippitt is meant to fix that problem for good, and it has been shown off at CES 2025. The system requires two essential parts, however, so let's talk about those. Meet the Swippit Link Image: Swippitt One aspect of Swippitt's system is what is called the Swippitt Link. This is essentially a special phone case that contains a 3,500mAh battery. We've seen battery cases before, but this one has a special trick. The battery inside it can be replaced—more on that later. So, not only do you get extra battery power in your phone's case, but when that extra battery gets low, you can swap it out for a new one in a matter of seconds. At the moment, the company plans to focus on these cases for Apple iPhones, but Samsung Galaxy devices are expected soon after that, and the company has already declared its intentions for Pixel phones too. Meet the Swippitt Hub Image: Swippitt Without the Swippit Hub, the Swippitt Link is merely a battery case, and we've seen those before. The Hub is what makes things special. Yes, it looks like a toaster, so try not to keep it in the kitchen. If you have a phone with a Swippitt Link and the battery in the Link is low, all you need to do is pop it into the Swippitt Hub. With five separate batteries stored inside the Hub, the dead battery in your phone's case will be taken out and replaced with a charged one. The best part is that it all happens in two seconds. Image: Swippitt That means that you're basically getting 3,500mAh of power in two seconds. There's no fast charger in the world that can dream of that. And since the plan is for all Swippitt Links to use the same 3,500mAh cell, it doesn't matter what kind of phone you have. As long as it has a Link on it, it'll work with the Hub. Do I Think This Is a Product for Which to Keep an Eye Out? To be honest, I like the idea of Swippitt. I don't think it is for everyone, to be honest. If you live alone and rarely need to get out of the house in a rush, a charger will probably do the job just fine. However, for families with multiple smartphones, this device could save you a lot of hassle. Image: Swippitt With the device's companion app, parents will even be able to monitor the battery percentage of family members' phones, down to knowing when they've swapped their batteries. That's definitely one route to peace of mind. I think the proprietary cases may be the major barrier to the adoption of Swippitt. I'm not a fan of cases, and when I am, I have specific tastes. And if your phone's actual battery is low, then Swippitt can only buy you some time—though of course, that's better than nothing.

I don\u0026#39;t think it is for everyone, to be honest. If you live alone and rarely need to get out of the house in a rush, a charger will probably do the job just fine. However, for families with multiple smartphones, this device could save you a lot of hassle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.talkandroid.com/?attachment_id=498109\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" width=\"847\" height=\"476\" src=\"https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Swiping-in-Action-847x476.jpg\" alt=\"This \u0026#34;Toaster\u0026#34; Could Be the Fix to Charging Struggles at Home 8\" srcset=\"https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Swiping-in-Action-847x476.jpg 847w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Swiping-in-Action-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Swiping-in-Action-380x214.jpg 380w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Swiping-in-Action-550x309.jpg 550w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Swiping-in-Action-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Swiping-in-Action-1160x653.jpg 1160w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Swiping-in-Action-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Swiping-in-Action.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20width=\u0026#39;847\u0026#39;%20height=\u0026#39;476\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%20847%20476\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-src=\"https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Swiping-in-Action-847x476.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Swiping-in-Action-847x476.jpg 847w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Swiping-in-Action-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Swiping-in-Action-380x214.jpg 380w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Swiping-in-Action-550x309.jpg 550w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Swiping-in-Action-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Swiping-in-Action-1160x653.jpg 1160w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Swiping-in-Action-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.talkandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Swiping-in-Action.jpg 1920w\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eImage: Swippitt\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith the device\u0026#39;s companion app, parents will even be able to monitor the battery percentage of family members\u0026#39; phones, down to knowing when they\u0026#39;ve swapped their batteries.

I\u0026#39;m not a fan of cases, and when I am, I have specific tastes. And if your phone\u0026#39;s actual battery is low, then Swippitt can only buy you some time—though of course, that\u0026#39;s better than nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eThrough Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast.
