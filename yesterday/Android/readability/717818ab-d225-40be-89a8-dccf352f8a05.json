Take for example the Pixel 7a, which is currently on sale right now – it’s an older model, but it’s capable of serving as a reliable daily smartphone. As for hardware specs, the phone comes with a compact 6.1-inch display with a smooth 90Hz refresh rate, and a dual-camera setup on the rear which includes a 64-megapixel main camera and an ultrawide lens, with support for a nice selection of camera modes and 4K video recording. The phone also features a sleek-looking design with a handful of different color options. Google has also included a ton of helpful AI software features, including monthly software updates for security and apps. You can check it out using the link below.
