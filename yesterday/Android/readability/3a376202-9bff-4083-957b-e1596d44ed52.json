  "text": "While a lot of eyes were on google’s I/O Conference today, Computex 2025 was well underway on the other side of the world, with big names in the industry all present for the show. In fact, silicon giant MediaTek took to stage to announce new AI updates, including its work on AI, 6G, edge, and cloud computing. The company showcased its latest developments on hybrid computing which includes its the 5G Generative AI Gateway, an AI Hub for smart homes, and an “edge cloud” collaboration with NVIDIA for low-latency, private AI. MediaTek’s partnership with NVIDIA has also led to the development of the NVIDIA GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, which the company boasts as the world’s smallest AI supercomputer. Both companies are also developing custom ASIC solutions for AI accelerators and datacenters. For the smart automotive segment, MediaTek says that its Dimensity Auto platform will feature AI-powered cockpit solutions including the Dimensity Auto Cockpit C-X1 which can run generative AI virtual assistants, as well as infotainment systems that support 8K displays and Dolby Surround audio. Meanwhile, its Dimensity Auto Connect MT2739 platform supports advanced 5G connectivity and AI-driven network optimization. IoT was another focus with the company’s new MediaTek Genio IoT platform that can run generative AI tools across smart homes, retail, and other industrial applications—this includes the integration of NVIDIA TAO, a model training toolkit in MediaTek’s NeuroPilot AI development tool, and will support Android, Yocto Linux, and Ubuntu operating systems. For connectivity, MediaTek has been working on multi-antenna technology for wearables and AI enhancements for its MediaTek Filogic Wi-Fi platform, as well as its 5G-Advanced LEO NR non-terrestrial network. Finally, MediaTek also unveiled the world’s first 15,000+ zone RGB mini-LED local-dimming control chip for large screens, as well as an 8K 60Hz AI-enhanced scaler for more realistic visuals.",
