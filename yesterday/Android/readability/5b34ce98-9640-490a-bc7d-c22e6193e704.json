Once this graduates from beta and rolls out to everyone, you'll be able to create a new community from the chats tab, by just hitting the hamburger (three dots) button at the top right and then selecting New community. Hitting that button can also take you to the creation of a new group, to your starred messages, or to Settings, as you can see in the screenshot above. Regarding Community creation, this addition basically saves you one tap, since you no longer need to first go to the Communities tab to create a new one. The reason for this could be the fact that the Communities tab will be replaced by a new tab dedicated to AI chatbots, because it's 2025 and you can't ever be allowed to escape AI chatbots. So if the Communities tab goes away, then this will be more than just a small improvement. Source",
