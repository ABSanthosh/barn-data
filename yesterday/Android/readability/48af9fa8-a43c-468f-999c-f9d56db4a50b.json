  "text": "Sign in to your XDA account It's a good time to give Prime a try as the retailer's major summer event is set to take place next week. Prime Day doesn't just deliver tons of impressive discounts on some of our favorite tech products, but it also offers hefty savings on a ton of other products as well. The only catch is that you need to be an Amazon Prime member in order to take advantage of all the sweet discounts, which does require a membership. Luckily, Amazon is offering a bunch of new ways to save on a Prime membership, like its new Prime for Young Adults program that knocks 50% off. This plan is aimed at students and those that are 18â€“24 years old. And while you might be on the fence when it comes to signing up, Amazon makes the deal even more enticing, throwing in a free six-month trial. Amazon Prime for Young Adults Prime for Young Adults lets 18 to 24 year-olds and students enjoy the full benefits of Prime for just $7.50 a month. Just in time for Prime Day, you can get a six-month trial before committing to the subscription! In addition to the above, Prime for Young adults will still be able to take advantage of all the usual Prime benefits, like lightning-quick shipping, exclusive discounts, access to popular shows and movies through Prime Video, and so much more. Again, if you sign up right now, you can get a six-month trial at no cost. And if you decide to keep it, it will only cost you $7.49/month, which is half the price of the usual monthly fee. And if you don't like it, feel free to cancel the service without any penalties. But you'll want to be quick because Prime Day starts next week, which means you'll want to sign up for Prime ahead of the event to take advantage.",
