  "text": "The search functionality in File Explorer helps you locate specific files or folders on your system. However, when dealing with a large dataset, a standard name search may not be efficient. This is where advanced search filters come into play. These filters enable you to find files based on their size, properties, metadata, type, extension, or even content, saving you both time and effort. Here are some advanced filters you can use in File Explorer to enhance your search experience. Related 8 Common file properties filters Use basic file attributes to narrow down your search quickly One of the simplest ways to improve your File Explorer searches is by filtering files based on their common properties. These include file names, modification dates, sizes, and types. The name: filter allows you to search for files that match a specific name or even a part of a name. For example, typing name: Pranav will display all files with \"Pranav\" in their name. This is particularly useful when you remember only a part of the filename. The datemodified: filter helps you find files modified on or within a specific date range. For instance, datemodified: October will return files edited in October, while datemodified:\u003e2/1/2024 will show files modified after February 1, 2024. Another handy filter is size:, which categorizes files based on their size. For example: size: tiny (0 - 16KB) size: small (16KB - 1MB) size: medium (1 - 128MB) size: large (128MB - 1GB) size: huge (1GB - 4GB) size: gigantic (greater than 4GB) You can also use it in other ways, such as size:\u003e100KB, which will list all files larger than 100 KB. If you want to find specific file types, use the kind: filter. For instance, searching kind: document will return Word documents, PDFs, and other text-based files. Similarly, kind: image or kind: picture retrieves image files, while kind: music or kind: video filters out audio or video files. 7 Advanced filters for specific file types Target files by extension, content, or author Advanced filters like file extensions, content searches, and author metadata become invaluable when you know the type of file you're looking for. The ext: filter allows you to search for files with a particular extension, such as ext:jpg for images or ext:mp3 for all mp3 audio files. If you're searching for files that contain specific text within their content, the content: filter can help. For example, searching content: TDS will display files containing the word \"TDS\" within the document body. I really loved this filter as it's a lifesaver when you're looking for files but can't remember their names, only the keywords they contain. For collaborative environments, the author: filter lets you find files created or modified by a specific person. For instance, author: Pranav will show files attributed to Pranav in their metadata. This filter works well for Office files (DOCS, PPTS, EXCELS) where author information is often included. Use metadata to locate photos, videos, and more Media files come with extensive metadata, which makes them ideal candidates for advanced filters. For instance, the datetaken: filter allows you to find photos taken on a specific date. For example, datetaken:12/01/2021 will return pictures captured on December 1, 2021. Note that this filter will only show the images taken by a camera or phone, i.e., the pictures that have been clicked. It won't display any other photos or files saved on your disk. The cameramodel: filter helps you locate photos taken with a specific camera. For instance, cameramodel: Canon will display all images shot with a Canon camera. If you like to find images with a particular width or height, use the width: and height: filters. For example, using width: 2976 will display all the photos with the width of 2976 pixels. Similarly, using height: 1984 will list all the images with height 1984 pixels. If you're organizing or searching by star ratings, the rating: filter can help. For example, rating: 5 stars will show files with a 5-star rating. This is particularly useful for photographers or videographers who rate their work. 5 Filters for music files Organize and search audio files with ease Music files often include metadata like album names, artist names, genres, and release years. The album: filter allows you to locate songs from a specific album, such as album: Number21 will list all the songs from the \"Number21\" album name. Similarly, the artist: filter lets you find music by a particular artist, like artist:Beatles. If you're curating playlists by genre, the genre: filter can help. For example, searching genre: LoFi will list all Lo-Fi music files. To find songs from a particular year, use the year: filter. For instance, year: 2023 will retrieve all audio files tagged with 2023 in their metadata. 4 Filters for documents Narrow your search by title, tags, or subject Document files often include metadata fields like titles, tags, and subjects. The title: filter allows you to search for documents with a specific title in their metadata. For example, the title: Finance will return documents with that title. Tags are another helpful way to organize and search for files. The tags: filter can help you find files tagged with specific keywords. For instance, tags: CamPic will display all files associated with the \"CamPic\" tag. Finally, the subject: filter lets you search for documents by their subject metadata. For example, subject: Promotional will return files with \"Promotional\" in their subject field. 3 Boolean operators Combine filters for even more powerful searches Boolean operators are an excellent way to refine your File Explorer searches by combining multiple criteria. By default, File Explorer assumes an AND relationship between filters. For instance, searching ext:jpg size:\u003c100KB will return all the JPG files of less than 100 KB in size. The OR operator is helpful when you're searching for different types of files. For example, kind: picture OR kind: video will show both image and video files in the results. Similarly, searching for ext: jpg OR ext: pdf will list all the files with JPG and PDF extensions. If you want to exclude specific files, use the NOT operator. For instance, ext: jpg NOT size:\u003c100 KB will display all JPG files larger than 100 KB in size. Additionally, you can use parentheses to group filters and create more complex queries. For instance, (name: project OR name: proposal) AND kind: document will return documents with \"project\" or \"proposal\" in their name. Mastering Boolean operators can make your searches highly precise and efficient. 2 Wildcard filters Use symbols to match unknown parts of a search query Wildcard filters are ideal when you only remember part of a filename or extension. The asterisk (*) acts as a placeholder for any sequence of characters, while the question mark (?) replaces a single character. For instance, the *.pdf will display all the files with .pdf in their name. Similarly, if there are filenames that begin with Pranav, but you don't remember the first three characters, you can simply use the ???nav in the search box. These filters are handy when dealing with files that follow a naming convention but include variations. Wildcards make it easy to locate such files quickly. 1 Search by range Filter files by size, date, or other numerical properties File Explorer supports numeric ranges, which is especially useful for filtering files based on properties like size or modification dates. To search within a specific range, use two dots (..) between the values. For example, searching size: 10KB..100KB will show files that are in the range of 10 KB to 100 KB in size. Similarly, datemodified: 1/1/2024..12/31/2024 will return files modified between January 1 and December 31, 2024. This approach works well for narrowing down large datasets, such as finding files created during a specific project timeline or identifying oversized files taking up disk space. Find your files smartly Windows search is often criticized for being slow and inefficient. However, by using advanced search filters like boolean operators, wildcards, meta-data-based searches, and more, you can make your search a lot better and find exactly what you need. These filters will make you a more efficient and smarter Windows user.",

To search within a specific range, use \u003cstrong\u003etwo dots (..)\u003c/strong\u003e between the values. For example, searching \u003cstrong\u003esize: 10KB..100KB\u003c/strong\u003e will show files that are in the range of 10 KB to 100 KB in size. Similarly, \u003cstrong\u003edatemodified: 1/1/2024..12/31/2024\u003c/strong\u003e will return files modified between January 1 and December 31, 2024.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThis approach works well for narrowing down large datasets, such as finding files created during a specific project timeline or identifying oversized files taking up disk space.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch3 id=\"find-your-files-smartly\"\u003e\n            Find your files smartly\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/how-fix-windows-search-not-working/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWindows search is often criticized for being slow and inefficient\u003c/a\u003e.
