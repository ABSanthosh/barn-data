  "description": "Yesterday we heard that Samsung delayed the Galaxy S25 Edge's planned April launch, and today a new rumor purportedly shares the new date on which the device will be fully unveiled: May 13. It's still unclear what the reason for the delay is, but at least it's not a big one - give or take one month from the initially rumored announcement date of April 15. Some have speculated that the delay doesn't have anything to do with quality issues, but instead is related to some changes in Samsung's management following the death of Samsung DX head Jong-Hee Han.

It's still unclear what the reason for the delay is, but at least it's not a big one - give or take one month from the initially rumored announcement date of April 15. Some have speculated that the delay doesn't have anything to do with quality issues, but instead is related to some changes in Samsung's management following the death of Samsung DX head Jong-Hee Han. If you were expecting another big in-person Unpacked event, you will apparently be disappointed, as Samsung is said to only have an online presentation on May 13. While that is the announcement date, it's still a mystery when the S25 Edge will become available - hopefully in May, but that information hasn't been outed yet. The Galaxy S25 Edge is rumored to sport the same screen as the Galaxy S25+, the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset at the helm, 12GB of RAM, 256 or 512GB of storage, a 200 MP main camera and an ultrawide, and it will be offered in at least three colorways: Titanium Silver, Titanium Jetblack, and Titanium Icyblue. It will allegedly retail in the Eurozone for €1,249, which is €100 more than the Galaxy S25+. Samsung is reportedly planning to make around three million units. Source",
