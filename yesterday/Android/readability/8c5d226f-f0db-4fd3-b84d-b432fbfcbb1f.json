According to the source of these shots, the lone camera on the top is the 200 MP 4.3x zoom periscope telephoto, which uses Samsung's ISOCELL HP9 sensor. On the bottom row we can find the 50 MP main camera, the 50 MP ultrawide, and the 50 MP 2x telephoto. For selfies, you'll get a 32 MP snapper. Xiaomi 15 Ultra leaked renders The Xiaomi 15 Ultra is also rumored to come with a 6.7-inch 120 Hz LTPO OLED micro-quad-curved display, the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset at the helm, and a 6,000 mAh battery with support for 90W wired and 80W wireless charging. The Ultra should run HyperOS 2.0 based on Android 15 from day one. Source",
