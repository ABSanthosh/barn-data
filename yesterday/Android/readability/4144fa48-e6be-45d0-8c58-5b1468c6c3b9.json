The GT 7 Pro launched in November and now it looks like its lesser sibling could be ready to join it soon. The certification reveals that the GT 7 has support for 120W wired charging as well as support for 5G. Neither of those things is surprising given the GT line's positioning in Realme's portfolio as the flagship series, but it's good to have confirmation nevertheless. A previous TENAA certification revealed that the GT 7 will come with a 6.78-inch \"1.5K\" AMOLED touchscreen and will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset just like the Pro model. This will be paired with 8/12/16/24GB of RAM and 128GB/256GB/512GB/1TB of storage. This certification also outed the images below showing the phone with a very similar design to the GT 7 Pro, but not quite identical. The GT 7 has a 50 MP main rear camera, an 8 MP ultrawide, and a 16 MP selfie snapper, as well as a 6,500 mAh battery and an in-display fingerprint sensor. If these specs sound familiar, it's because they're identical to those of the GT 7 Pro, save for one key detail - the non-Pro model doesn't have a telephoto camera on its rear.
