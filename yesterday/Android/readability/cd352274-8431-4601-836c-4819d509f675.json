With that in mind, a new update has began rolling out to Google Wallet which now lets parents keep an eye on when their children make digital payments. READ: Google’s New Updates Make it Easier for Parents to Keep Safe with Their Kids The new update allows users in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Spain and Poland to supervise their kids when accessing digital payments via their Android device. The update will start seeding over the next few weeks, and kids will be able to use Google Wallet for tap to pay, and store passes such as library cards, gift cards, and tickets. With that said, a child’s payment cards can be added with parental consent, and parents and guardians will be notified via email should their kid make a transaction. Additionally, parents will be able to track recent purchases, remove payment cards and turn off access to passes via their Family Link settings.",
