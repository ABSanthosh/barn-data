Fitbit’s rather-affordable fitness band is currently at its lowest price right now, and this deal on Amazon brings it down to around 80 bucks. In contrast to the more expensive Fitbit Versa models, the Inspire 3 is more of a standard fitness tracker, which comes with a slimmer and lighter design, although it does offer longer battery endurance. It comes with all the features you’d expect from a fitness tracker including heart rate monitoring, SPO2 and sleep tracking, and more than 20 different exercise modes.
