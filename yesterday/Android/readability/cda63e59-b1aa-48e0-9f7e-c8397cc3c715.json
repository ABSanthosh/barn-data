The source is allegedly a wireless carrier, and the information was also allegedly confirmed by a second source. So, let's dive in. The Pixel 9a will be powered by the Tensor G4 chipset just like the rest of the Pixel 9 family. The mid-range phone will have 8GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and 128/256GB of UFS 3.1 storage. Google Pixel 9a leaked spec sheet The Pixel 9a comes with a 6.285-inch 1080x2424 display with 120 Hz refresh rate, 240 Hz touch sampling rate, 2,700-nit peak brightness, 1,800-nit HDR brightness, and Gorilla Glass 3 on top. On the rear will be a 48 MP f/1.7 main camera using the Samsung ISOCELL GN8 sensor, and a 13 MP f/2.2 ultrawide using the Sony IMX712 sensor. The same sensor will also be used for the front-facing camera. Google Pixel 9a leaked spec sheet (continued) Battery-wise, we're looking at a 5,100 mAh cell with support for 23W wired charging and 7.5W wireless charging. The Pixel 9a will be IP68 rated for dust and water resistance. The phone measures 154.7 x 73.3 x 8.9 mm and weighs 185.9g. That means it's ever so slightly taller and wider than its predecessor, while weighing less - and all of that with a 13% larger battery. The handset will apparently launch in Obsidian, Porcelain, Iris, and Peony colorways. Pricing will start at $499 for the 128GB model, while Verizon's version with support for mmWave 5G will go for $549. Naturally, the Pixel 9a will arrive with Android 15 on board and will be supported for seven years with OS and security updates. According to previous rumors, the Pixel 9a will become official in March. Source",
