As always, do take all of this with a grain of salt. OnePlus Ace 5 official imageSo, the Ace 5 is said to come with a 6.78-inch \"1.5K\" LTPO OLED screen with 120 Hz refresh rate, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, 12/256GB, 12/512GB, 16/256GB, 16/512GB, and 16GB/1TB of LPDDR5x RAM and UFS 4.0 storage, a triple rear camera system (50 MP with OIS main, 8 MP ultrawide, and an additional 2 MP), a metal frame, an optical in-display fingerprint sensor, and a 6,415 mAh or 6,500 mAh battery (the two sources today couldn't quite agree on this point) with support for 80W wired charging. The only changes the Ace 5 Pro brings are the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, and a 6,100 mAh battery with support for 100W wired charging, otherwise it's fully identical to its non-Pro sibling. Thickness and weight are allegedly \"pretty good\" without any specific details. Past rumors claimed the Ace 5 / 13R would only get a 6,200 mAh battery, so today's rumored capacity is improved - then again, the Pro was supposed to have a 6,300 mAh cell and now it's said to be 6,100 mAh.
