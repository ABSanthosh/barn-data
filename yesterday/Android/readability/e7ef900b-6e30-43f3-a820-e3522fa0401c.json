  "text": "ASUS recently announced the debut of its new ZenScreen Smart monitor, which the company markets as an all-in-one entertainment hub. The monitor runs on Google TV, giving users access to a ton of different content streaming services, as well as pretty impressive hardware specifications. Up front you’ll find a 27-inch 4K-resolution IPS display with 178-degree viewing angles, a 99% sRGB gamut, VESA DisplayHDR™ 400 certification, as well as a pair of front-facing 5 W Harman Kardon-certified speakers. ASUS adds that it’s designed to let users switch between play or productivity modes via an easily accessible source switch. ASUS claims that the Zenscreen Smart is designed to “replace” dedicated PCs, as it lets users do their online video chats, browse the web, and even create documents via Google Workspace, and connect to wireless keyboards and mice. Connectivity via smart home appliances including Google Cast and Miracast is also present. As for design, the ZensScreen Smart packs a rather streamlined and minimalist-looking design, with a handy approach to cable-management that reduces clutter with your cables. It starts at $450.
