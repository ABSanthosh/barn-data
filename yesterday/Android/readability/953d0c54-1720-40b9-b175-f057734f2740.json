Visible is an MVNO that Verizon owns, and it's a good place to find yourself if you're a fan of Verizon's network infrastructure, but you're not a fan of its pricing (especially as those prices have been going up in recent years). Visible also offers monthly and annual pricing plans across its Visible and Visible+ plans. Over the holiday season, Visible introduced a deal offering lower prices on both of its plans, and the discounts were pretty tasty. However, today marks the final day that you'll be able to take advantage of the deal, and it's certainly one worth hopping onto because you'll get those discounted prices locked in for the next two years. Here's the Last Chance to Grab Visible's Discounted Plans (and Lock the Price for 25 Months) Image: Visible Back in December, Visible by Verizon decided to do its own part in making the holiday season better for its subscribers (and intending subscribers). It did so by offering a sensible discount on its Visible and Visible+ plans. For those who choose to pay for the plans on a monthly basis, they'd get $5 off the basic Visible plan and $15 off the Visible+. On its own, that's good enough, but that isn't even all. For those who grab onto the deal, they end up getting those discounted monthly plans locked in for the next 25 months. That's wild and it means that you'll be enjoying the discounted prices through the entirety of 2025 and 2026. You'll only need to worry about new pricing when 2027 comes around, and that seems so far away, doesn't it? Image: Visible Regarding this offer, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that the deal is still active, so if you want, the code SWITCH25 will let you take hold of it. The bad news is that today, January 31st, is literally the last day that it's on offer, so you're going to have to act quickly or lose out on lower prices for the next two years. Just to be clear, you'd be saving $125 and $375 on the Basic and Plus plans, respectively. Here's Why Visible's Plans Are Worth the Money If you're on the fence and you just need someone to give you a push with a little more weight than the discounts offer, then let me paint a picture regarding what you get with Visible. Image: Visible Visible's basic plan, discounted to $20 a month, will get you unlimited talk, text, and data using Verizon's 4G LTE and 5G networks, including unlimited talk and text to Canada and Mexico; 480p video streaming, and unlimited mobile hotspot use. However, if you decide to upgrade to Visible Plus, discounted to just $30 a month, you get a lot of value for the extra $10. For one, you get access to Verizon's 5G UWB, for faster speeds, 50GB of premium data, a $10 discount on Verizon Home Internet, bundled smartwatch service, double the speed on your unlimited mobile hotspot, and quite a bit more. It's definitely worth that extra, especially with the lowered prices. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
