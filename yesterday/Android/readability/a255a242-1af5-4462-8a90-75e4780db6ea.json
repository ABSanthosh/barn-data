The feature was made available following Google’s 2025 I/O conference back in May. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Review (SAVE $400!) READ: AI Mode Finally Arrives for Google Search For those unfamiliar, the AI Mode feature is designed to handle complex and more nuanced queries and runs with Google’s Gemini 2.5 on the backend for advanced reasoning and multimodal capabilities. Additionally, AI Mode lets users ask longer and more detailed questions that previously would have required multiple searches. For example, a user could ask for indoor activities for kids, and AI Mode would provide tailored suggestions, and you can further ask follow-up questions to delve deeper into a topic. Google says that AI Mode stands out thanks to its integration with its information systems, with access to real-time data from the Knowledge Graph, real-world information, and shopping data. For the app, users can speak their queries using the microphone icon, and even upload or take photos for visually-based queries.
