  "text": "While Samsung’s Galaxy S-series devices are undoubtedly its most popular Android phones, the company’s best sellers continue to be its midrange handsets, which fall under the Galaxy A branding. With that in mind, Samsung recently announced the launch of three new additions to its more affordable lineup, which includes the Galaxy A56, A36, and A26. READ: Samsung’s Galaxy A16 is one of the Cheapest Phones You can Buy Right Now While the phones pack some key differences, there are also certain similarities between the three devices – for one, all three models come with a 6.7-inch FHD+ resolution Super AMOLED Display, complete with a 120Hz refresh rate (even on the A26). All three models also feature Gorilla Glass Victus+ on both the front and back, which is a much-welcome addition. All phones also come with 5,000 mAh batteries, all wrapped up in a chassis with IP67 dust and water protection. As for what sets the phones apart, the Galaxy A56 comes with the Exynos 1580 chipset with 8GB RAM and 128GB of storage, while the A36 comes with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 and 6GB RAM and 128GB storage, which is the same memory and storage configuration for the Galaxy A26. Samsung does confirm that all three phones will also receive up to six years of software updates – this includes One UI version upgrades, as well as Samsung’s exclusive AI features in addition to Google AI software such as Gemini and Circle to Search. Samsung has also equipped different camera systems across all three devices – all three come with a 50MP main camera with f/1.8 aperture, AF, and OIS, although there are differences elsewhere. The A56 boasts a 12MP ultra-wide and 5MP macro setup, while the A36 has an 8MP ultra-wide and 5MP macro tandem. Meanwhile, the A26 features an 8MP ultra-wide and 2MP macro system. Additionally, the A56 and A36 both use a 12MP front camera, whereas the A26 uses a 13MP front camera, all with f/2.2 aperture. READ: Samsung’s tri-fold phone could launch at a later date As for pricing, the Galaxy A36 5G starts at $399.99 and is available in Awesome Black and Awesome Lavender variants, with Awesome Lime exclusively available at Best Buy beginning March 26. Meanwhile, the Galaxy A26 5G starts at $299.99, and will be available in Black beginning March 28. The Galaxy A56 5G will be available later this year starting at $499.99.",
