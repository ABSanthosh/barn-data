The company updated its official support page with the new insurance provider, as well as the one-time payment option that covers a Pixel phone, tablet, or watch for two years (via Android Authority). Previously, all Pixel devices had to be protected with Preferred Care via a subscription.Google's Preferred Care plans are a means of insuring a Pixel or Fitbit device, just like AppleCare Plus or Samsung Care. Starting today, there are two different ways of purchasing a Preferred Care plan. You can either insure the device for two years with a one-time payment, or choose a monthly subscription for up to 60 months of total coverage. In the event your screen is cracked, you'll pay $29 for a repair or up to $129 for a replacement.The new offering coincides with a notice that Google changed its insurance provider for Preferred Care: \"If your device is shipped on or after February 24, 2025, your Service Contract Provider will be Asurion Warranty Protection Services, LLC, or one of its affiliates,\" the company explains in the support document. \"If your device is shipped prior to February 24, 2025, your Service Contract Provider will be Assurant.\"The only apparent consumer-facing change as part of the switch is the addition of the one-time payment option. Like the monthly plan, you can either add a plan during checkout at the Google Store or within 30 days of your purchase.The prices for the two-year Preferred Care plans are as follows:Google Pixel 9: $159Google Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL: $249Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold: $279Google Pixel Fold: $279Google Pixel 8 Pro: $249Google Pixel 8: $159Google Pixel 8a: $109Google Pixel 7a: $99Google Pixel 7 Pro: $199Google Pixel 7: $149Google Pixel Tablet: $99Google Pixel Watch 3: $89Google Pixel Watch 2: $89The above prices offer buyers a slight discount on Preferred Care compared to the cost of subscribing monthly for two years. Of course, the downside is that you can't insure your Pixel device with Preferred Care beyond 24 months if you use the upfront option.Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Brady is a tech journalist for Android Central, with a focus on news, phones, tablets, audio, wearables, and software.
