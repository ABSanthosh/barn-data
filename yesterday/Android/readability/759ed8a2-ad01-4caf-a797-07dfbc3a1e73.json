  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Google Fi might not be the most popular option when it comes to cellular service, but it's been a decade since it was first introduced, and it's still alive and kicking, offering consumers another choice with flexible plans, excellent international coverage, along with fantastic discounts on hardware as well. Related Google Fi: What plans does it offer and how can I subscribe? Google's MVNO isn't for everyone, but it can offer substantial savings Of course, timing is everything if you're looking to save big, with new deals popping up at the most unexpected times. With that said, we're now seeing a new promotion from Google Fi that discounts the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9a down to $0, while also providing a hefty discount on the service as well (via 9to5Google). This is one of the more aggressive promotions we've seen in some time, making it a great time to switch services. The Pixel 9 series are some of the best phones we've seen from Google. Not only are you getting solid hardware at the top end, but the more affordable Pixel 9a is also quite good as well. If you've been following Google on its Pixel journey, you'll understand why this is so important. Of course, the software is going to be quite solid, with a number of Pixel-exclusive features being present as well. More importantly, Google Fi is now offering these phones at a hefty discount, dropping the price down to $0, which is a number that's going to pique some interest. However, the way you get these discounts is a little different for each phone, with the Pixel 9 seeing a discount at purchase, then a monthly credit issued over 24 months that brings the total cost down to $0. Those that are looking to pick up a Pixel 9a will see monthly credits applied to their account, which will bring down the phone to $0 after 24 months. What makes these promotions even better is that Google Fi is now knocking $15 off per month when signing up for its Unlimited Premium plan. The plan is normally $65/month and features unlimited talk and text, along with 100GB of high-speed data. The plan also includes smartwatch coverage as well, data in over 200 global locations, hotspot connectivity, and 100GB of storage with Google One. For the price, not a bad deal considering the current discounts. So if you've been thinking about buying a new phone and want to grab something with a plan, this Google Fi promo might just be the thing. Just be aware that Google's Pixel 10 lineup is just around the corner. Google Fi Google Fi is a prepaid phone carrier with coverage and features squarely aimed at Android users. It stands out by offering an unparalleled international roaming feature with competitive pricing when you bring multiple lines. Google Fi also makes use of multiple cell networks for strong 5G and Wi-Fi coverage in both urban and rural areas.",

If you\u0026#39;ve been following Google on its Pixel journey, you\u0026#39;ll understand why this is so important. Of course, the software is going to be quite solid, with a number of Pixel-exclusive features being present as well. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eMore importantly, Google Fi is now offering these phones at a hefty discount, dropping the price down to $0, which is a number that\u0026#39;s going to pique some interest. However, the way you get these discounts is a little different for each phone, with the Pixel 9 seeing a discount at purchase, then a monthly credit issued over 24 months that brings the total cost down to $0. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThose that are looking to pick up a Pixel 9a will see monthly credits applied to their account, which will bring down the phone to $0 after 24 months. What makes these promotions even better is that Google Fi is now knocking $15 off per month when signing up for its Unlimited Premium plan. The plan is normally $65/month and features unlimited talk and text, along with 100GB of high-speed data. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe plan also includes smartwatch coverage as well, data in over 200 global locations, hotspot connectivity, and 100GB of storage with Google One. For the price, not a bad deal considering the current discounts. So if you\u0026#39;ve been thinking about buying a new phone and want to grab something with a plan, this Google Fi promo might just be the thing.
