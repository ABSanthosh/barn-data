  "text": "Google Pixel Tablet Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Google's unique Pixel Tablet timer widget is now available to all. While not through official channels, the Google Clock 7.12 APK provides access on other Android devices. Grab it from APKMirror and gain access to new timer widgets. It's been a couple of years since the release of the Google Pixel Tablet. And while there were some rumblings of a Pixel Tablet 2, all hopes were dashed late last year when we received news of its cancelation. With that said, there is still hope that Google is working on a successor for its tablet, but it's still unclear when and if a new Pixel Tablet will arrive. Related And while there really isn't any choice but to wait, the company has done a great job supporting the current Pixel Tablet with new software updates that offer improvements and new features. The most recent update comes in the form of the March 2025 Pixel Feature Drop, delivering a wealth of new features to enjoy for the time being. Of course, Google does also make an effort to distinguish its products from others on the market, and mostly does this through various software features. And while some of them might be complex, making use of AI, others are a bit simpler, like the exclusive Google timer widget found on the Pixel Tablet. If you've been eyeing this timer widget for your own Android device, the good news is that it's now available to all. The folks at 9to5Google were the first to make this discovery, sharing that a new update makes it possible to load onto other Android devices. With that said, you won't find it by simply updating your device or downloading the latest version from the Google Play Store. Instead, you'll have to use a workaround in order to get it loaded on your device that requires downloading the APK through APKMirror. The good news is that it's actually quite simple and safe. All you need to do is just head to the APKMirror website, download, and install the Google Clock 7.12 update. From here, you'll have access to the new timer widgets on your device that used to be exclusive to the Pixel Tablet. There are a few different widget sizes to choose from, so customize the new timer widget to your liking. For the most part, this isn't really going to be anything essential, but it's just a nice touch to add to your current device.",
