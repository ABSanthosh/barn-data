Huawei Enjoy 70X colors As you can see, the camera island is shaped in the style of the Mate series, instantly elevating the design of what is just a mid-range smartphone after all, and that was clearly the intention here. The Enjoy 70X has a 6.78-inch 1224x2700 OLED screen with 120 Hz refresh rate, 2,160 Hz PWM dimming, and 1,200-nit peak brightness, the Kirin 8000A chipset at the helm, a 50 MP main camera, a 2 MP decorative sensor of some sort, and an 8 MP selfie snapper. The handset could have a 6,100 mAh battery with support for 40W wired charging. It will be 7.98 mm thick and will weigh 189g. Source (in Chinese)",
