Redmi Pad 2 European retailer listings If you want 4G access too, it looks like you'll need to pay €299, but that version also gets you 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, both of which sound much more manageable in 2025 than the 4/128GB combo. The listings show a Mint Green colorway as well as a gray-ish/black one, and we assume those will be the only versions. All of them mention that the tablet is powered by MediaTek's Helio G100 SoC, it has a 9,000 mAh battery, and an 11-inch IPS LCD screen with \"2.5K\" resolution, 90 Hz refresh rate, and 600-nit peak brightness. Camera-wise there will be an 8 MP rear shooter and a 5 MP front-facing one. The tablet will support 18W wired charging but won't ship with a charger in the box in Europe. Via",
