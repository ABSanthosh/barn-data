Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 is expected to debut on the iQOO Z10 Turbo later this month with more devices from Xiaomi, Oppo, Meizu and others set to launch with the new chip soon. Motorola announced the Edge 60 Fusion. It has a 6.67-inch 120Hz P-OLED with a peak brightness of 4,500 nits, a Dimensity 7300 or 7400, depending on the region, and is IP68/IP69 and MIL-STD-810H rated for extreme temperatures and height. The main camera is a 50MP Sony Lytia 700C, there's also a 13MP ultrawide. Upfront is a 32MP selfie shooter. Inside you either get a 5,200mAh or 5,500mAh (region dependent) battery with 68W charging. The Motorola Edge 60 Fusion is starting to appear in regional Motorola sites, like Germany and Spain, where only the 12/256GB model is available and is priced at €330, and India, where the phone is coming soon and will start at ₹21,000. We also saw more than a few images and video samples from vivo's upcoming X200 Ultra flagship. It will have a 35mm main camera, 85mm zoom camera, and a new 14mm large-sensor ultrawide. The X200 Ultra is coming sometime this month. Company Product Manager Han Boxiao shared images captured with the new ultrawide, which has the 50MP Sony LYT-818 1/1.28-inch sensor at the helm - size-wise, it puts the new larger-sensor ultrawide in the Galaxy S25 Ultra to shame. We got the brand new Motorola Edge 60 Fusion in for review and also put the Poco F7 Pro against the F7 Ultra in a comparison review - check 'em out. The latest Moto phone is svelte and pretty in vegan leather in Slipstream blue. Poco F7 Pro vs. F7 Ultra The Ultra is a new addition to the lineup, bringing an even beefier chipset and extra camera chops - is it worth the extra cost over the Pro?",
