  "text": "While it tends to be frequently forgotten and shrugged off, Google’s TV platform is actually quite a big and successful product. Apparently, there are currently more than 270 million Google TV device owners around the world. The online giant is launching a special “insider” program of sorts to help shape the future of the OS. It is called the Google TV Advisory Community, and people have started reporting and seeing banners to join said community popping up on their Google TV devices. The banner description says that the space is an “exclusive online community where you can help improve the Google TV experience.” It seems that Google intends the whole thing to be a bit more involved than simply taking surveys. Sure, there will be that as well, but the tech giant also anticipated other “fun research activities” to take place as well. Expect interaction once or twice a month. There are certain perks for joining. The most obvious one would be to beta test “new Google TV features that are about to be released.”. Beyond that, participants will be eligible to win one of five $50 gift cards in a monthly draw. Presumably, you need to own a Google TV device to participate in the Advisory Community, though there is a public sign-up form that seems to be open to anyone at the moment. Of course, participants will give up quite a bit of personal data, and the terms and conditions allow Google to collect “audio, video, or photographs of you and your interactions with our products and services.” The content captured by the brand may include “your face, voice, physical features, mannerisms, likeness, and interactions.” So, maybe don’t apply if you want your media consumption habits to stay relatively private.
