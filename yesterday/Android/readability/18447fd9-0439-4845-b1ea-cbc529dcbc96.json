The new branding was announced by the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), which is based on Qi v2.2.1. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Review (SAVE $400!) READ: Google’s Pixel Wireless Charger could be its first true Qi2 accessory Alongside the new announcement, the WPC adds that major Android smartphones will join the Qi2 ecosystem. Part of its official press release reads: In addition to Apple iPhone, major Android smartphones will join the Qi2 ecosystem for the first time with this launch. Fourteen devices, receivers and transmitters, completed Qi2 25W certification testing in a limited launch last week. Full-scale certification testing is now open to several hundred devices waiting in the queue to be tested. As you can probably tell from the name, Qi2 25W will support faster charging speeds, compared to the slower 15W that the older Qi2 technology uses. While many Android smartphones support wireless charging capabilities, they tend to lack built-in magnetic hardware such as the ones found in Apple’s MagSafe-equipped iPhones. A lot of manufacturers get around this by working with accessory manufacturers to include magnetic cases to enable physically-secure wireless charging.",
