  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Google showed off Project Astra's latest capabilities in a 90-second video at Google I/O 2025. Astra acts like a real agent, opening apps, navigating Android, and tracking movements. Google's Astra is a step towards a universal AI assistant, evolving from chatbot to a truly personalized assistant. Google's Gemini AI has been steadily evolving since back when it was called Bard. The latest demo takes things to a whole new level. Project Astra, Google's next-gen AI prototype, just showed it can act on your behalf by actually controlling your phone . Related The company showcased a new Astra demo at Google I/O 2025 (via Android Authority). The AI assistant solved a real-world problem entirely on its own in this demo. When the user asked for help fixing their bike, Astra took the reins. It found a manual, opened a PDF, scrolled to the right page, and played a YouTube tutorial video. Astra now acts like a real agent who lives in your phone It's the kind of multitasking AI that sounds like science fiction, but Google showed it off in action. Astra didn't just respond with suggestions in the demo. It actively opened apps and navigated Android using simulated screen taps and swipes. A small on-screen overlay tracked its movements, so the user could confirm it was running commands just like a human would. This is a leap beyond what we've seen from Google's browser-based Project Mariner, which automates online tasks. Astra shows signs of being a truly universal AI agent. It understands context, makes plans, and follows through. Google hasn't said when this feature might launch, but it's clear Astra is in active development. Of course, there are still some rough edges. The video Google shared appears to be sped up, which hints that Astra might take a while to act in real-time. It's also unclear if these capabilities are running on-device with Gemini Nano or if it's all handled in the cloud. We're quickly approaching personal AI Even so, the new Astra demo gives a clear look at where AI is headed. Google hopes Gemini, or whatever it calls it in the future, will evolve from a chatbot into an all-encompassing personalized AI assistant. That vision is clearly becoming a reality in real time as the company builds out multimodal understanding, agentic planning, and action-based features. We're not there yet. But at this rate, Google may beat every other platform to delivering a truly universal AI assistant , whether you want it to or not.",

href=\"https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-universal-ai-assistant/#live-capabilities\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoogle I/O\u003c/a\u003e 2025 (via \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/project-astra-android-ai-agent-3559266/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAndroid Authority\u003c/a\u003e). The AI assistant solved a real-world problem entirely on its own in this demo. When the user asked for help fixing their bike, Astra took the reins. It found a manual, opened a PDF, scrolled to the right page, and played a YouTube tutorial video. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"astra-now-acts-like-a-real-agent-who-lives-in-your-phone\"\u003e\n                        Astra now acts like a real agent who lives in your phone\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s the kind of multitasking AI that sounds like science fiction, but Google showed it off in action. Astra didn\u0026#39;t just respond with suggestions in the demo. It actively opened apps and navigated Android using simulated screen taps and swipes. A small on-screen overlay tracked its movements, so the user could confirm it was running commands just like a human would. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThis is a leap beyond what we\u0026#39;ve seen from Google\u0026#39;s browser-based Project Mariner, which automates online tasks. Astra shows signs of being a truly universal AI agent. It understands context, makes plans, and follows through. Google hasn\u0026#39;t said when this feature might launch, but it\u0026#39;s clear Astra is in active development.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there are still some rough edges. The video Google shared appears to be sped up, which hints that Astra might take a while to act in real-time. It\u0026#39;s also unclear if these capabilities are running on-device with Gemini Nano or if it\u0026#39;s all handled in the cloud.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch3 id=\"we-39-re-quickly-approaching-personal-ai\"\u003e\n            We\u0026#39;re quickly approaching personal AI\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, the new Astra demo gives a clear look at where AI is headed. Google hopes Gemini, or whatever it calls it in the future, will evolve from a chatbot into an all-encompassing personalized AI assistant. That vision is clearly becoming a reality in real time as the company builds out multimodal understanding, agentic planning, and action-based features.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003e\nWe\u0026#39;re not there yet. But at this rate, Google may beat every other platform to delivering a truly universal     \n\n        \n\u003cspan data-id=\"1014893\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/google-gemini-guide/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAI assistant\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n, whether you want it to or not.     \u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n    \n\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
