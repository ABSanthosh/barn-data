The Mate X6 has bigger displays than the Galaxy Z Fold6 but weighs the same 239g. The Mate X6 is also impressively thin when folded at just under 10mm (compared to 12.1mm for the Galaxy). There's a solid feel about the Mate X6. It folds with a neat clasp and unfolds with a mechanical assurance from the hinge. It's also lovely to look at in this Nebula Gray. Both displays are superb.

The Mate X6 has bigger displays than the Galaxy Z Fold6 but weighs the same 239g. The Mate X6 is also impressively thin when folded at just under 10mm (compared to 12.1mm for the Galaxy). There's a solid feel about the Mate X6. It folds with a neat clasp and unfolds with a mechanical assurance from the hinge. It's also lovely to look at in this Nebula Gray. Both displays are superb. The inner one is particularly large (a tad larger than the one on the Honor Magic V3) and is perfect for running two apps side-by-side. Huawei is staying silent regarding the chipset inside the Mate X6, but it's the Kirin 9020 and we can say the Mate X6 feels responsive and every bit flagship-fast at least after the initial setup. Huawei is pushing the envelope when it comes to cameras on foldables. The Mate X6 has a 50 MP main cam with an RYYB sensor and with f/1.4-f/4.0 variable aperture alongside a 48 MP periscope telephoto with 4x optical zoom and a 5cm super macro mode. The third shooter is a 40 MP ultrawide with autofocus. We'll give you a review spoiler and will say the photos from the Mate X6 are impressive - especially the 2x ones. Huawei Mate X6 That's it for now, but stay tuned for our full review!",
