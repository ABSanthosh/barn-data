That said, so far the focus has primarily been the Pro. That changed today as Realme has put up a listing for the 'vanilla' 15, which confirms some of its specs. It's powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7300+ SoC, and boasts a display with 144 Hz refresh rate and 6,500-nit peak brightness, bolder design, smarter AI, and sharper videos from its dual 50 MP 4K cameras.

That said, so far the focus has primarily been the Pro. That changed today as Realme has put up a listing for the 'vanilla' 15, which confirms some of its specs. It's powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7300+ SoC, and boasts a display with 144 Hz refresh rate and 6,500-nit peak brightness, bolder design, smarter AI, and sharper videos from its dual 50 MP 4K cameras. The Realme 15 is 7.66mm thin but still manages to fit a 7,000 mAh battery with support for 80W wired charging. The phone is also IP69 certified for dust and water resistance. It will be offered in Silk Pink, Velvet Green, and Flowing Silver. The missing specs have been filled in by an Indian tipster over on X. He claims the screen size is 6.8\", the rear cameras are a 50 MP main and an 8 MP ultrawide, the selfie camera is 50 MP, and there's an optical in-display fingerprint sensor too. The Realme 15 Pro seems to be incredibly similar, but is 0.03mm thicker, and has a 50 MP ultrawide camera, while being powered by the already officially confirmed Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 SoC. So the chipset, the ultrawide, and the marginal thickness increase seem to be the only differences between the two - well, aside from the price of course. Source 1 | Source 2",
