Get it now for its best price as it drops to just $250 for a limited time. You no longer need to spend $1,000 to buy a really good smartphone in 2025. Sure, spending a lot of money doesn't hurt if you're looking to grab the best, but there's also a lot out there that checks all the right boxes, while still coming in at a price that's really affordable. Related The Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 is one such option, featuring a large and beautiful pOLED display, great performance and battery life, and even comes with a stylus, which is pretty rare to find on smartphones today. The best part is that this phone is pretty affordable, thanks to a steep $150 discount from Amazon, which brings it down to just $250 for a very limited time. What's great about the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024? Motorola is known for making some of the best affordable phones out there and the Moto G Stylus 5G is one of its more alluring options. Not only do you get a sleek and stylish design, but it also features an impressive 6.7-inch pOLED display with a peak refresh rate of 120Hz. You also get a built-in stylus, which means you can easily jot down notes or sketch out some ideas when needed. The overall experience is pretty snappy thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 chip that's paired with 8GB of RAM. You also get 256GB of built-in storage, and a microSD card slot for expansion up to 2TB. This phone is an absolute beast when it comes to battery life, allowing you to go more than a day without a charge. And when you do, you have the option of 30W wired fast charging or 15W wireless charging. You get a 50MP main camera and a 13MP ultrawide camera in the rear, along with a 32MP front-facing camera. Perhaps most surprising, you get a 3.5mm audio jack, which means you can listen to your music using your favorite pair of wired headphones or earbuds. The phone is powered by Android 14, with Google providing an excellent space to work with. There's also access to some of the best apps available via the Google Play Store. You get a lot of bang for your buck here, and at its newly discounted $250 price tag, the phone's even better.
