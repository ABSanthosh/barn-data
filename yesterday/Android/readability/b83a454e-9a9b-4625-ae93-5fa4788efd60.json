  "text": "(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central) The holidays are swiftly approaching, so folks from all over are on the hunt for great Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra deals. Amazon, for example, has extended an excellent Cyber Monday discount that carves 27% off the super-powered smartphone, but before you smash that Buy Now button, it's important to ask yourself one question: is it worth buying a Galaxy S24 when the S25 is likely to be released next month?Indeed, rumors and leaks have suggested that the S25 series is likely to be unveiled in January, and we're sure to see a number of great Galaxy S25 preorder deals that make the flagship phones cheap (or even free). So what should you do? Let's discuss. Samsung's Cyber Week sale ends Sunday! See all the best deals nowIf past years are any indication, we can expect the Galaxy S25 series to be revealed sometime in mid-January with a street date set for a week or two after the announcement. The flagship lineup is likely to include at least three phones — the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra — all packed to the brim with the latest Snapdragon processors and Galaxy AI features. There's no doubt that the phones will be impressive, but there's good reason to expect that they won't be dramatically different from the S24 series. After all, the Samsung phones released this year all come with seven years of OS/security updates and deliver outstanding AI-powered performance, and Samsung typically focuses more on careful refinement than dramatic reinventions with its new releases. So how badly do you really need the latest devices on the street? The choice is yours, but if you're looking for a great holiday gift, I wouldn't snooze on this S24 Ultra deal.In conclusion.. ✅I recommend this deal if: you're shopping for the holidays and you want an amazing Android phone at a stellar discount (even if it's going to be considered last-gen very soon); you want a phone with years of software support, excellent cameras, and AI features. ❌Skip this deal if: you want the latest and greatest from Samsung and don't mind waiting until January; you're looking for a good trade-in opportunity or carrier deal.  Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android After almost a decade of working in the e-commerce space, Patrick Farmer (he/him) began his career at Android Central as a Deals and Commerce Writer before moving into a new role as AC's eCommerce Editor in 2023.
