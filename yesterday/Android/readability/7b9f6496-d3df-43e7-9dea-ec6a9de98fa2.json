  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary AT\u0026T is offering a new International Day Pass for travelers. This plan will be most beneficial to those traveling by cruise ship, with service provided on land and sea. Users will need to pay $20 per day for use, and will get unlimited talk and text, along with 500MB data. When it comes to cellular coverage, big brands like AT\u0026T have done a pretty good job of expanding their network, ensuring that you'll be able to message or take calls, even if you're in some of the more remote regions of the US. Related With that said, there are limitations, and that's when some alternate services or equipment might be necessary, like if you're out to sea on a cruise. And while connectivity would normally not be possible, that's where AT\u0026T's International Day Pass comes into play. A pricey way to expand its offerings Of course, the wireless carrier has offered this service for some years now, but is now making changes that will give its subscribers a bit more. The new pass will be available for use on over 400 cruise ships, which will provide users with a way to stay connected for $20 per day. And yes, that price is the daily rate, so if you're out to sea for quite some time, this daily pass could get pretty pricey. As far as what you'll get, AT\u0026T shares that its new International Day Pass will provide unlimited talk and text, along with 500MB of data. For most, that amount of data isn't really going to be too beneficial. But if you're checking emails or using alternative messaging platforms, it could come in handy. Plus, this plan works whether you're on the ship or walking about at your destination, making it quite versatile. Of course, if you're a heavy data user, it may be more beneficial to pay for the cruise ships' Wi-Fi plan. If you want an alternative solution, you can always sign up for Starlink and bring that with you when you're setting sail. Of course, this is a bit extreme, but if you're someone that's going to be out at sea for weeks or maybe even months, this might actually be worth it considering that Starlink provides impressive connection speeds, since it does offer ocean use plans that start at $250.",

a bit more. The new pass will be available for use on over 400 cruise ships, which will provide users with a way to stay connected for $20 per day.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAnd yes, that price is the daily rate, so if you\u0026#39;re out to sea for quite some time, this daily pass could get pretty pricey. As far as what you\u0026#39;ll get, AT\u0026amp;T shares that its new International Day Pass will provide unlimited talk and text, along with 500MB of data. For most, that amount of data isn\u0026#39;t really going to be too beneficial.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eBut if you\u0026#39;re checking emails or using alternative messaging platforms, it could come in handy. Plus, this plan works whether you\u0026#39;re on the ship or walking about at your destination, making it quite versatile. Of course, if you\u0026#39;re a heavy data user, it may be more beneficial to pay for the cruise ships\u0026#39; Wi-Fi plan.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf you want an alternative solution, you can always sign up for Starlink and bring that with you when you\u0026#39;re setting sail. Of course, this is a bit extreme, but if you\u0026#39;re someone that\u0026#39;s going to be out at sea for weeks or maybe even months, this might actually be worth it considering that Starlink provides impressive connection speeds, since it does offer ocean use plans that start at $250.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                            \n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
