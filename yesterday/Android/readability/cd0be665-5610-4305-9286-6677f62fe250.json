  "description": "Rumors so far suggest that the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip FE is indeed coming next year. It will be a toned-down version of the original Z Flip at a lower price to appeal to the masses. Details have been pretty scarce as of late, but an industry insider has recently posted on X, revealing the chipsets powering up the Galaxy Z Flip FE and the Z Flip7. It looks like the FE will adopt the Exynos 2400e, while the Z Flip7 will get the still-unreleased Exynos 2500. This signals a shift in strategy as the Galaxy Z Flip6 this year launched with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, while the...",

It looks like the FE will adopt the Exynos 2400e, while the Z Flip7 will get the still-unreleased Exynos 2500. This signals a shift in strategy as the Galaxy Z Flip6 this year launched with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, while the successor is now expected to run an in-house Exynos 2500. On the other hand, the Z Flip FE having an Exynos 2400e chipset comes as no surprise as Samsung will be cutting costs to achieve a more reasonable price point. Still, the Exynos 2400e is a pretty powerful SoC to begin with and doesn't seem to be lagging behind the full-fledged Exynos 2400 in common everyday tasks. We've seen it perform well in the Galaxy S24 FE this year, so Samsung opting for it might be a good idea. Back to the Galaxy Z Flip7, the news about using an Exynos 2500 might not be too far-fetched. A recent report came out suggesting the Galaxy S25 lineup will all be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, which in turn means Samsung is reserving its flagship SoC for the foldables. Especially if those rumors about Exynos 2500 yield issues are true. Source",
