  "text": "While Qualcomm is mostly known among tech enthusiasts for its work on smartphone silicon, the company also devotes a lot of resources towards other industry fields, as seen with the unveiling of its latest chips. Dubbed the Qualcomm QCC730M and Qualcomm QCC74xM, the new modules are designed for use with smart home and other IoT products. First up is the QCC730M, which is a dual-band micro-power Wi-Fi 4 module that packs a dedicated MCU running at 60MHz, in addition to 640kB SRM and 1.5 RRAM, integrated hardware crypto accelerator, and secure boot, debug, and storage. A lot of tech speak, but it’s essentially developed to be used with hardware such as IP cameras, and other smart home security gear. Meanwhile, the QCC74xM is a programmable connectivity module, that allows apps to run with RISC-V configurations. It also features wireless connectivity support for WiFi, Bluetooth, and other features including security acceleration engine, security services, and is PSA Certified Level One. Qualcomm says that this works well for applications such as IoT hubs or hotspots, and other hardware for smart home management. With all that said, Qualcomm is now marketing the new chips to potential developers and adopters, with commercial availability set to arrive next year. Source: Qualcomm",
