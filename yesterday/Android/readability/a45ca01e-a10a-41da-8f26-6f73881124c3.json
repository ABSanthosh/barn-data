  "text": "Summary The newest update to the Google Contacts app for Android adds a sync status card so users can see their sync status and number of contacts stored across Google. This new update also allows easier access to sync settings directly from the Contacts app. Small UI tweaks include hiding signed-in accounts for a cleaner view. Google is rolling out a minor tweak to the Google Contacts app for Android . This now makes it easier to check the app's backup and sync status. There are also a few new tweaks to the overall UI. Related Version 4.49 of Google Contacts displays a new card in the Organize tab (via 9to5Google). This card shows some new information that wasn't there before: The number of contacts stored in your Google account. The current Google Account. The last time the account was synced to the cloud. This update brings easier access to sync settings This new info card is interactive. Tapping on it opens a new page with an explanation that reads: “Contacts stored with your Google Account automatically sync with this device and are available across Google services anywhere you sign in, including contacts.google.com.” There's a new shortcut to Google Contacts sync settings below this explainer. Here, you can control your backup and sync options. It's a convenient change to the previous system, where this setting was buried inside Google Play Services, so having access to it directly from the Contacts app is a rather big step in the right direction. The account switcher has also received some love from Google. Now, the Last sync status appears inside the account menu. Any signed-in accounts are no longer listed by default. Instead, you need to tap a chevron to expand and view all the available accounts. You can still quickly switch accounts by swiping up and down from the homepage, if that's what you prefer. It may not seem convenient to hide signed-in accounts at first glance, but it does help keep the UI cleaner and more organized for people with multiple accounts. These updates are rolling out now as part of Google Contacts version 4.49 on Android. The changes are rather small, and insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but there's a lot to be said for a clean and uncluttered UI, and these tweaks make it easier to manage contacts across devices.",
