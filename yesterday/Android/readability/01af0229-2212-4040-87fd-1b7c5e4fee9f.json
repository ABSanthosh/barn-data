That being said, buyers interested in grabbing one might want to take advantage of this deal, which takes off 20% off its usual price. In terms of specs, the Fitbit Sense 2 comes with wireless connectivity for both Android and iOS devices, all-day stress detection, and even lets users keep an eye on their sleep, SpO2 metrics, and even ECG metrics. There are also built-in functions for workouts, GPS tracking, and up to six days of battery life. There’s also an OLED display that features touch controls, and Bluetooth connectivity.
