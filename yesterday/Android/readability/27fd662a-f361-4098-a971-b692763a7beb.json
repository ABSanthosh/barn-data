We’re also rolling out two new features for Find My Device compatible tags:Temporarily Pause Location: You can now temporarily pause location updates from your phone to prevent your device’s location from being used by a detected unknown tag for up to 24 hours. This provides an extra layer of privacy and control, allowing you to take a first action quickly while you locate and physically disable the tag.Find Nearby: If you receive an unknown tracker alert, you can now use the \"Find Nearby\" feature to pinpoint the tag’s location. Your Android device will guide you to the tag, to help you find it if it's hidden.Your safety is our priority, so we're continuously improving unknown tracker alerts to help you stay ahead of unwanted tracking.
