The Samsung tri-fold device has a screen size of just under 10\" when fully unfolded at the moment, but do keep in mind that the same report also tells us that the design hasn't been finalized yet. Interestingly, the report also claims that sales of the Galaxy Z Fold SE are less than 100,000 units so far. Samsung is also rumored to be developing the Galaxy Z Flip FE for this year. Samsung expects to sell around 7 million foldable devices this year, of which 3 million will be Flip7 units, 2 million Fold7 units, 900,000 Flip FE units, and the aforementioned 200,000 tri-fold units.
