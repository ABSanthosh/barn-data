  "text": "Spotify recently announced that it’s rolling out new app updates to make finding, following, and enjoying podcasts easier and more streamlined for users, and provide an easier way for artists and creators to connect with their audience as well. Part of the company’s official statement on the update reads: Spotify is all about bringing you closer to the voices and stories you love… Building on that vision, we’ve started rolling out new mobile features that make it even easier to find, follow, and fall in love with the latest podcasts, audio, and video. This is a win for creators, too, as it gives them new ways to reach even more audiences around the globe. READ: Spotify clarifies they won’t ban users for using a VPN For one, the Home screen now features personalized podcast and video podcast recommendations just below your shortcuts, and users can play or save these suggestions instantly. For podcasts, all new episodes from the podcasts you follow are now consolidated into a single, dedicated Podcasts Following feed within the main Podcast feed on the Home page. Additionally the new “In this episode” section will let creators link directly to other Spotify content (like songs, audiobooks, or other podcasts) mentioned in their shows, right on the episode page. Spotify is also enhancing comments with threaded replies and emoji reactions, and creators still maintain full control over their comment settings via their Spotify for Creators account.",
