  "text": "The OnePlus 13 is certainly one of the more impressive Android devices we’ve seen so far, and it does come with a rather capable camera hardware system. If you own the OnePlus 13, then you might be pleased to now that the OnePlus recently announced an update for the phone’s night mode capabilities. More specifically, the update allows OnePlus 13 owners to use the phone’s native Night Mode feature directly within the Instagram app, similar to how Google implemented Night Sight via Instagram a while back. If you were wondering how to use the feature, here’s quick rundown of what you’ll need to do: Open Instagram’s camera feature (make sure you’ve updated the app) When the scene gets dim, Night Mode will automatically turn on, with a moon icon on the top of your screen Tap the shutter, and hold steady for a few seconds OnePlus hasn’t specified if this feature will arrive for its other devices, although we’re certainly hoping that it does. At the moment however it’s a nice feature to have especially in a phone that’s done a pretty good job when it comes to mobile photography.",
