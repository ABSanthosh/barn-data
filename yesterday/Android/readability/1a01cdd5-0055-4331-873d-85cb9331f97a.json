During Amazon's Memorial Day sale, the retailer has cut the price of the Sony WH-CH520 wireless headphones down to just $38, marking a 37% discount on a pair of headphones that's already pretty affordable.These budget headphones feature up to 50 hours of battery life per charge and are charged using a USB-C charging port. They also include customizable equalization using the Sony Headphones Connect App, and while they miss out on noise-cancelling modes, they still include a built-in microphone for clear phone calls. Plus, they feature smaller ear cups that many people prefer to larger ones included on most premium headphones, and they come in six different colors: Blue, Black, Pink, Cappuccino, and Yellow.Amazon just launched its Memorial Day sale early — I found the 20 deals that no Android user should miss✅Recommended if: you're looking for a pair of headphones that will get you multiple days' worth of battery life; you want an affordable pair of wireless headphones from a trusted brand like Sony; you like headphones with ear cups that are a little on the smaller side.❌Skip this deal if: you'd rather go with in-ear earbuds; you're looking for the best wireless headphones available and don't mind spending the extra money; you need features such as lossless hi-res listening, active noise cancellation, or spatial audio.Those looking for a cheap pair of Sony wireless headphones will find a lot to appreciate with the Sony WH-CH520s, especially due to their 50-hour battery life, comfortable fit, low pricing, and their decent call and audio quality.
