  "description": "The freshly announced Samsung Galaxy A16 5G has landed at our HQ for review, but before we put it through its paces, let's do a quick unboxing and see what's on offer. The Samsung Galaxy A16 5G comes in a white-colored retail box, including some paperwork, a SIM ejector tool, and a charging cable. We've got the blue model, but there are three more colors you can opt for. On the front, we have a 6.7\" FullHD+ 90Hz AMOLED screen with a notch for the 13MP selfie camera.

The Samsung Galaxy A16 5G comes in a white-colored retail box, including some paperwork, a SIM ejector tool, and a charging cable. We've got the blue model, but there are three more colors you can opt for. On the front, we have a 6.7\" FullHD+ 90Hz AMOLED screen with a notch for the 13MP selfie camera. However, there's no fingerprint scanner underneath since it's embedded in the power button. Turn the phone around, and you see a plastic back cover sporting a triple camera setup aligned vertically in the left corner. It's a combination of a 50MP primary, 5MP ultrawide, and 2MP macro cameras. Under the hood is the Exynos 1330 SoC with up to 8GB RAM and 256GB storage. The Samsung Galaxy A16 5G runs Android 14-based One UI 6.1 out of the box and comes with the promise of six years of Android version upgrades and six years of security updates, which is one of the biggest highlights of the smartphone. The Samsung Galaxy A16 5G is IP54-rated, and keeping the entire package up and running is a 5,000 mAh battery with 25W charging support. But if you don't have a compatible power adapter, you'll have to shell out extra money since the smartphone doesn't come bundled with one. We will begin our review process soon, so stay tuned to find out if the Samsung Galaxy A16 5G is worth buying.",
