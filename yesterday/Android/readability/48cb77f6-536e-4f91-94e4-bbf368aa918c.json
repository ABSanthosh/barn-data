Samsung took a huge dump on the bed with its handling of its Android 15-based OS, One UI 7. Although the OS was officially launched several months before the end of last year, it took until April for things to start moving out, even for last year's flagship options. Delay is not denial, as they say, so I'm glad it's here. The best news of all is the fact that even though it took this long, things have finally started moving smoothly. In the last weeks, the S24 had its rollout resumed, and the S23 and S22 families have joined the fun. The S21 family rollout started days ago, so I think it is safe to say things are good. One UI 7 Makes Its Way to the Galaxy S21 Series in South Korea Image: Talk Android Back when the Samsung Galaxy S21 series launched, it was promised that the phones would get four years of major OS updates. Considering that the devices came out in 2021, that gave them up to 2025 to stay up to date with Android, and that year is finally here. That means that One UI 7 is the final update for the S21 phones, so that makes it rather bittersweet that the update has started rolling out to the phone in South Korea. Image: Samsung The S21 is Samsung's oldest flagship slated for One UI 7, so it shows the extent to which the rollout has progressed. At the moment, most users internationally won't have the opportunity to install the update, but it should be available globally in the next few days. It is still wild that it took until May for One UI 7 to be delivered finally.

Things are going smoothly, and hopefully, will continue to do so. Here Are Samsung's Devices Which Have Started Receiving One UI 7 in At Least One Region Image: Samsung Since rollouts tend to start in Samsung's home country of South Korea, several phones from the OEM have started getting the update, but may not have done so in your region just yet. For instance, I have a Galaxy S22 Ultra, and even though the rollout has commenced, it is yet to find its way to my region. That's fine, though, since it shows it's just a matter of time. Here's a list of all the Samsung devices that have started to receive the One UI 7 update in at least one region: Samsung Galaxy S24 family, including the S24 FE Samsung Galaxy S23 family, including the S23 FE Samsung Galaxy S22 family Samsung Galaxy S21 family Samsung Galaxy Z Fold SE Samsung Galaxy Z Fold/Flip 6 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold/Flip 5 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold/Flip 4 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold/Flip 3 Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 family Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 family Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 family Compared to a few weeks ago when we were reporting on the rollout being paused, that's a whole lot of progress. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
