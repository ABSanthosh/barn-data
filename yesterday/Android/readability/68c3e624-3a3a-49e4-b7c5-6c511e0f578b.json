  "text": "Gaming accessory brand CRKD recently announced that it’s launching its new NEO S Frost Edition controller, a new – and exclusive – design of the NEO S gaming controller which unsurprisingly comes with a rather chilly look. It does pack a ton of features as with the rest of CRKD’s other gear, although there’s a catch. Available in limited quantities, the controller is designed for Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac and even Apple TV. It’s also on sale at select Apple stores, adding to its exclusivity. It should be noted that the “standard” NEO S controller works fine with the Nintendo Switch, PC, as well as oher mobile devices. With that said though, if you own an Apple device and are interested in grabbing the controller, it comes with features including Hall-Effect Thumbsticks, integrated Motion Controls, adjustable Trigger Sensitivity, remappable back buttons, as well as adjustable vibration and swappable stick tops for a bit of added personalization. The NEO S Frost Edition goes on sale starting today online and via select Apple Store locations. It’s not too expensive as well, going for $59.99.",
