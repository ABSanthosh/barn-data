  "text": "Audio Sonos Move 2 $359 $449 Save $90 The Sonos Move 2 speaker isn't the most portable, but it can be used wirelessly in your home or other spaces. It delivers a fantastic audio experience and is now $90 off for a limited time. Sonos makes some of the best smart speakers that you can buy right now. And if you're looking for one that offers robust sound and offers tons of battery life, then the Move 2 is going to be right up your alley. Not only is the audio quality good, but it's also extremely versatile when it comes to connectivity, and is now $90 off for a limited time. This is one of the best prices we've seen in quite some time, so get it while you can at this discounted price. Related Sonos Move 2 review: Worth the weight Sonos has nailed the execution — and the sound quality — with its updated portable smart speaker What's great about the Sonos Move 2? The Sonos Move 2 is just one of those speakers that will far exceed your expectations. Not only do you get impressive sound quality, but the ability to be able to connect via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth makes it incredibly versatile too. And while you can keep it plugged in, this speaker is also capable of working on battery power as well, providing up to 24 hours of use on a single charge. When it comes to the design of the speaker, it looks good in any room, offering a simple design that also manages to stand out with just a touch of elegance. For the most part, you really can't go wrong with this speaker, especially at its current discounted price. Perhaps one of the only things you can't do with this speaker is use it for calls. So if that's something that you need, then this is one to avoid. But for most, this speaker is going to be an absolute gem. It delivers the perfect balance when it comes to the experience, and looks good doing it. You gain access to a wealth of features using the app, and there are also touch controls in order to keep things simple. The Sonos Move 2 gained high marks in our review for a reason. So if you've been looking for a smart speaker that's fairly complete, now's going to be the time to grab this one.",

far exceed your expectations. Not only do you get impressive sound quality, but the ability to be able to connect via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth makes it incredibly versatile too. And while you can keep it plugged in, this speaker is also capable of working on battery power as well, providing up to 24 hours of use on a single charge. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to the design of the speaker, it looks good in any room, offering a simple design that also manages to stand out with just a touch of elegance. For the most part, you really can\u0026#39;t go wrong with this speaker, especially at its current discounted price. Perhaps one of the only things you can\u0026#39;t do with this speaker is use it for calls. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSo if that\u0026#39;s something that you need, then this is one to avoid. But for most, this speaker is going to be an absolute gem. It delivers the perfect balance when it comes to the experience, and looks good doing it. You gain access to a wealth of features using the app, and there are also touch controls in order to keep things simple. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe Sonos Move 2 gained high marks in our review for a reason. So if you\u0026#39;ve been looking for a smart speaker that\u0026#39;s fairly complete, now\u0026#39;s going to be the time to grab this one. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
