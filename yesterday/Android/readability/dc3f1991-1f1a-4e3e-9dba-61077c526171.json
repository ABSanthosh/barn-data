It's unclear if these are all the hues in which the A26 will be offered. As you can see, Samsung continues to change the design of the rear cameras for its non-flagship devices. Like other new and upcoming A-series phones, the A26 also has a single oval-shaped camera island housing all three sensors, instead of three separate camera bumps. The phone's screen has a notch and a very substantial chin, while the rest of the bezels are decently sized for this price point. There's also a circular LED flash array on the rear, and the power and volume buttons are on the right as is the tradition for Samsung smartphones. The Galaxy A26 has been rumored to measure 164 x 77.5 x 7.7 mm (9.7 mm with the camera bump), which means it's taller, wider, and slimmer than its predecessor. The screen size has been rumored to be 6.64\". The A26 will be powered by Samsung's Exynos 1280 SoC just like the A25, paired with 6GB of RAM in one version, but of course more memory options could be offered. The A26 is likely to launch running Android 15 with One UI 7 on top. The device has already been certified a couple of times, so its launch may be imminent. Source",
