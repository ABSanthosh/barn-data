There's not a single major network carrier that offers 5G and doesn't throw it in your face. It's understandable since when it comes to the internet, the first thing that customers prioritize is its speed. However, even though there are so many carriers with 5G services, not all phones support the network technology, especially in the budget range. If you don't have a 5G phone but you want to have a taste of that 5G magic, T-Mobile isn't hesitating to help you out. With the carrier's newest deal, you'll be able to get a 5G phone for free, and you don't even need to trade in your old device or even activate a new line. Let's talk about it. Buy a Budget 5G Phone From T-Mobile at Walmart and Get It for Free With No Strings Attached Image: Peter Holden/TalkAndroid If you've really been in need of a phone with 5G capabilities, regardless of how much of a budget device it might be, there's no better place for you to be than with T-Mobile at this moment. Courtesy of The Mobile Report, the carrier's new deal is giving you the chance to get a free 5G device without any strict requirements—you don't need to trade in a phone, and you also don't need to activate a new line to get it. There's only one catch, though I wouldn't consider it to be the most inconvenient in the world. You might know that T-Mobile has a store-in-store program where it operates within other establishments. For instance, Walmart is a good example, as you can walk into a Walmart store and essentially find a T-Mobile section. That's the catch. You're going to have to buy the device at Walmart. However, as long as you're on a postpaid plan and you can finance a new device, you'll be able to take advantage of this deal. You'll technically be buying the phone in installments, but over 24 months, you will receive monthly credits towards the price of the device, meaning that you never have to really pay for it. However, if you do decide to pay the phone off early for whatever reason, you'll forfeit all the remaining credits. Which 5G Phones Is T-Mobile Offering With This Deal? Image: Samsung If you've found yourself perked up at the idea of this deal, then you might want to know which smartphones T-Mobile will actually be offering. Knowing that they have 5G isn't enough on its own. You'll have a little bit of choice in the matter, as the carrier will be offering six devices, namely: Motorola Moto G 5G (2024) Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) Samsung Galaxy A16 5G Samsung Galaxy A15 5G Samsung Galaxy A14 5G T-Mobile REVVL 6x 5G Not All Walmarts Have T-Mobile Kiosks Available Image: Walmart Since this is an in-person deal, you'll have to visit your local Walmart. However, not all Walmart outlets have T-Mobile kiosks. You'll need to make sure that yours does before you go, and this list will help make that easier. That 5G smartphone could be yours soon.
