The flagship model is a bit more expensive this time around, but the 16/512GB option is available with a $100 discount, bringing its price down to that of the OnePlus 12 last year. There is a cheaper 12/256GB model too, but without a discount. We took the OnePlus 13 for a photo tour of Sri Lanka and have a detailed review, which you can check out – video review too. The company has committed to 4 OS updates and six years of security patches. The OnePlus 13R is getting released next week and you can pick it up with a $100 gift card. The 13R is like a “lite” version of its flagship sibling – it has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 instead of an 8 Elite and its 6,000mAh battery does only 80W wired charging (but no wireless). This generation, it even has a telephoto camera, a 50MP 47mm unit with 2x optical and 4x in-sensor zoom. It doesn’t have the reach (or optical stabilization) of the 50MP 73mm module on the 13, but the 13R will be tough to beat in the value-for-money department. Another phone that recently expanded to markets worldwide is the Red Magic 10 Pro. This is a gaming phone with an actively-cooled Snapdragon 8 Elite (thanks to the built-in fan) and it has a 6.85” 144Hz OLED display with an under display camera and square corners – unlike almost anything else on the market. Its 50MP main (1/1.5”, OIS) and 50MP ultra wide cameras are decent, but again, the focus is on gaming. This is why the phone is equipped with a massive 7,050mAh battery with 80W charging. Speaking of gaming, Lenovo unveiled the Legion Go S handheld console this week. What’s unique about it is that it is the first handheld to come with SteamOS out of the box, aside from the Steam Deck itself. However, only the Windows 11 version is available right now. It uses the older AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme APU configured with 32GB of RAM and 1TB storage. Cheaper variants will use the new Ryzen Z2 Go chip. If you’ve been following CES announcements, you can’t have missed Nvidia’s new GPU line-up. Best Buy has three of the new cards – GeForce RTX 5070, 5080 and the top-of-the-line RTX 5090 – on pre-order. These are the Founders Edition, which are dual-slot cards, while most partner brands have opted for thicker coolers. We will have to wait for reviews to find out if Nvidia’s cooling solution is enough (the 5090 in particular has a TDP of 575W). We may get a commission from qualifying sales.",
