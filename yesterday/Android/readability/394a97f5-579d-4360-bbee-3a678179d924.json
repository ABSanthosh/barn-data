  "description": "AnTuTu is back with a new monthly report, this time covering the benchmark runs performed in China in January. As usual, it's a battle between devices powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite and MediaTek's Dimensity 9400 in the flagship smartphone chart. In fact, it's an even 50/50 split between the two in the Top 10. That said, in January the Dimensity 9400 managed to grab the top spot thanks to the vivo X200 Pro's average score of 2,896,624. It's followed by the OnePlus Ace 5 Pro with 2,888,193, the Red Magic 10 Pro+ with 2,868,701, the iQOO 13 with 2,853,651, and the iQOO Neo10 Pro...",

As usual, it's a battle between devices powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite and MediaTek's Dimensity 9400 in the flagship smartphone chart.

It's followed by the OnePlus Ace 5 Pro with 2,888,193, the Red Magic 10 Pro+ with 2,868,701, the iQOO 13 with 2,853,651, and the iQOO Neo10 Pro with 2,836,633 to round up the Top 5. Only the No.1 and No.5 sport the Dimensity 9400, all the others have the Snapdragon 8 Elite. The vivo X200 is in sixth place, the X200 Pro mini in seventh, the OnePlus 13 in eighth, the Oppo Find X8 Pro in ninth, and the Honor Magic7 Pro in tenth. Moving over to the upper-midrange chart, the Redmi Turbo 4 rules with its average score of 1,738,244, which places it at a very comfortable distance from the OnePlus Ace 3V in second place. The Dimensity 8400 SoC in the Redmi clearly shows how important an all-big core CPU configuration is for such benchmark results, while the Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 in the OnePlus is still no slouch, but after a very long period of ruling this chart, it's been very clearly dethroned. The Realme GT Neo6 SE is in third, the Oppo Reno13 Pro in fourth, the Redmi K70E in fifth, the Reno13 in sixth, the Redmi Note 12 Turbo in seventh, the Reno12 in eighth, the Reno11 in ninth, and the iQOO Z8 is in tenth place. The entire chart contains only devices powered by the Dimensity 8 series and Snapdragon 7+ series chipsets. Finally, we have tablets. The Red Magic Nova with its overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is in front of the Oppo Pad 3 Pro using the same chipset, but only barely. These are followed by the iQOO Pad2 Pro with its Dimensity 9300+, the vivo Pad3 Pro with the 9300, the OnePlus Pad Pro with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the Lenovo Legion Y700 2025, the Xiaomi Pad 6S Pro 12.4, the vivo Pad3, iQOO Pad 2, and Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro.
