It’s easier than ever to find and use accessibility features, especially compared to Windows 10. While these tools were built with specific needs in mind, they’re actually useful for everyone — helping you stay focused, work through long documents, and even control your PC with just your voice. Related 8 Windows 11 features that should never have been added Windows 11 is great, but there are features that never should have been added - here are workarounds for some of them 6 Voice access Control your PC with your voice Windows 11 introduced an accessibility feature called Voice Access, which lets you control your PC using voice commands. While voice control is often associated with assistive technologies for people with limited mobility, Voice Access can be an incredible tool for anyone who wants a more hands-free experience. This feature can help you perform a variety of tasks, such as opening apps, dictating text, and navigating through settings. For example, instead of using the keyboard or mouse to open your browser, you can simply say, \"Open Chrome.\" I know it sounds like a modern voice assistant, and it is to some extent, but Voice Access doesn't have the same features you’d expect from something like Google Assistant or even the good old Cortana (RIP). It does come with three modes, depending on what you need. The default mode lets you switch between giving commands and typing text. There’s also a command mode for just issuing commands without dictating. Or you can go with dictation mode if you just want to talk and type without giving commands. Plus, Voice Access doesn’t need an internet connection to work. Related How to set up voice access on Windows 11 Voice access makes it easier to use your Windows 11 PC using just your voice. Here's how to set up this feature. 5 Live captions Useful when you forget your earbuds Captions aren’t just for people with hearing impairments. They’re a great feature for anyone who wants to get the most out of audio and video content. The Live captions feature in Windows automatically generates captions for any audio playing on your PC, whether it’s from a video, music, or even a podcast. You no longer need to rely on pre-set captions that might not even be available. This is especially helpful in noisy environments. It’s also perfect for those who want to stay focused or juggle multiple tasks. Reading captions while listening can actually help reinforce what you're hearing. 4 Focus Eliminate distractions Focus is a Windows feature designed to help you stay on task by cutting down on distractions. Interestingly, Focus isn’t listed under Accessibility settings, but Microsoft still considers it an accessibility feature. That’s probably because it helps users who struggle with distractions, whether due to ADHD, sensory sensitivities, or just everyday interruptions. You can tweak Focus to suit your needs, choosing \"Priority Only\" (which allows only essential notifications like reminders or calls) or \"Alarms Only\" (which silences everything except alarms). You can even set it to turn on automatically during specific times, like when you're in full-screen mode for a presentation or gaming session. And if you're someone like me who needs music to concentrate, Focus even lets you connect your Spotify account in the Clock app to play the perfect background audio, whether it’s the Interstellar soundtrack or just some white noise.

Self-awareness and discipline are also a must. 3 Read text out loud with the Narrator You don't have to read that wall of text The Narrator feature has been a staple in Windows for a while, but its capabilities have greatly expanded over the years. Originally designed as a screen reader for those with visual impairments, Narrator is now a powerful tool for anyone who wants text read aloud. Narrator can read aloud any text on the screen, including documents, websites, and emails. If you often deal with large amounts of text, whether it’s legal documentation, research papers, or eBooks, having text read aloud can be helpful. For example, if you’re reading an article or a long report, you can have Narrator read the text to you while you take care of other tasks, like replying to emails or finishing your snack. You can also customize Narrator to suit your preferences. You can adjust the speed, pitch, and voice or choose from several available voices. 2 On-Screen keyboard For when your keyboard is throwing tantrums The On-Screen Keyboard in Windows is a virtual keyboard that appears on your screen, allowing you to type using a mouse, touch screen, or other pointing device. This feature is especially useful for those with mobility issues, but it also comes in handy for anyone who has temporary difficulties using a physical keyboard, whether it’s due to an injury or because you're working in a setting where a physical keyboard isn’t available. I found it particularly useful when some of the keys on my keyboard stopped working. You can fully customize the On-Screen Keyboard to suit your needs. For example, you can adjust the size of the keys or choose from different layouts, such as QWERTY or Dvorak. 1 Mouse pointer options Give your mouse pointer a new look Windows lets you customize your mouse pointer, and while it’s mainly an accessibility feature, anyone can use it to make their cursor easier to see (or just cooler to look at). The quickest way to change it in Windows 11 is through Settings. You can adjust the size and color to make it stand out more. Just go to Start -\u003e Settings -\u003e Accessibility -\u003e Mouse pointer \u0026 touch and pick what works best for you. You can also enable pointer trails to see where your mouse moves. To turn this on, go to Start -\u003e Settings -\u003e Bluetooth \u0026 devices -\u003e Mouse -\u003e Additional mouse settings. In the Mouse Properties window, open the Pointer Options tab and select Display pointer trails. Windows can also offer visual feedback when you touch the screen, which you can enable from the accessibility settings. If you're looking for even more customization, you can add your own mouse cursor design. While Windows provides some built-in options, you might prefer something more unique. You can browse for custom cursors in the Microsoft Store, where a few options are available for download.

And if the built-in Windows features aren't enough, you can install PowerToys to access more tools designed for power users.

Interestingly, Focus isn’t listed under Accessibility settings, but Microsoft still considers it an accessibility feature. That’s probably because it helps users who struggle with distractions, whether due to ADHD, sensory sensitivities, or just everyday interruptions.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eYou can tweak Focus to suit your needs, choosing \u0026#34;Priority Only\u0026#34; (which allows only essential notifications like reminders or calls) or \u0026#34;Alarms Only\u0026#34; (which silences everything except alarms). You can even set it to turn on automatically during specific times, like when you\u0026#39;re in full-screen mode for a presentation or gaming session.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAnd if

If you often deal with large amounts of text, whether it’s legal documentation, research papers, or eBooks, having text read aloud can be helpful. For example, if you’re reading an article or a long report, you can have Narrator read the text to you while you take care of other tasks, like replying to emails or finishing your snack.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eYou can also customize Narrator to suit your preferences.

screen, or other pointing device. This feature is especially useful for those with mobility issues, but it also comes in handy for anyone who has temporary difficulties using a physical keyboard, whether it’s due to an injury or because you\u0026#39;re working in a setting where a physical keyboard isn’t available.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eI found it particularly useful when some of the keys on my keyboard stopped working. You can fully customize the On-Screen Keyboard to suit your needs. For example, you can adjust the size of the keys or choose from different layouts, such as QWERTY or Dvorak.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"mouse-pointer-options\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e1 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Mouse pointer options\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"give-your-mouse-pointer-a-new-look\"\u003e\n            Give your mouse pointer a new look\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eWindows lets you customize your mouse pointer, and while it’s mainly an accessibility feature, anyone can use it to make their cursor easier to see (or just cooler to look at). The quickest way to change it in Windows 11 is through Settings. You can adjust the size and color to make it stand out more. Just go to \u003cstrong\u003eStart -\u0026gt; Settings -\u0026gt; Accessibility -\u0026gt; Mouse pointer \u0026amp; touch\u003c/strong\u003e and pick what works best for you.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eYou can also enable pointer trails to see where your mouse moves. To turn this on, go to \u003cstrong\u003eStart -\u0026gt; Settings -\u0026gt; Bluetooth \u0026amp; devices -\u0026gt; Mouse -\u0026gt; Additional mouse settings\u003c/strong\u003e. In the Mouse Properties window, open the Pointer Options tab and select Display pointer trails.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWindows can also offer visual feedback when you touch the screen, which you can enable from the accessibility settings. If you\u0026#39;re looking for even more customization, you can add your own mouse cursor design. While Windows provides some built-in options, you might prefer something more unique. You can browse for custom cursors in the Microsoft Store, where a few options are available for download.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n                        \n
