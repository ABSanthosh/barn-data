The two devices are scheduled to arrive on 8th July as well, along with the company’s wearables. READ: OnePlus Buds 4 launch and OnePlus Watch 3 confirmed for July 8 In terms of specifications and features, OnePlus revealed a few key components for the Nord 5—the phone will be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chip, a new 730mm cooling chamber for gaming, and up to “144 fps” gaming for graphically-intensive games. As for the Nord CE5, OnePlus didn’t really say too much aside from some teaser images on its official webpage. In addition to the new phones and wearables, OnePlus has also teased the OnePlus Pad Lite for the upcoming launch, which features a design similar to the brand’s earlier tablet efforts, instead of the newer redesign that we got with the OnePlus Pad 3.",
