The cherry on top is that right now, this monitor can be had for half off, which brings it down to its lowest price to date at just $100. Related Can you use a TV as a computer monitor? If any screen comes with an HDMI port, it can act as an alternative or second computer monitor. What's great about the LG MyView Smart Monitor? Source: LG You get a nice 27-inch IPS display with a resolution that comes in at 1080p. That means great viewing angles and also good colors and contrast. In addition, and as mentioned before, this monitor runs webOS, making it possible to run apps on the monitor, which means access to all your favorite streaming services like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and so many more. The monitor also provides access to over 300 free TV channels, and you can also stream media from your compatible device to the monitor using Apple AirPlay 2. There's also plenty of connectivity as well, with two HDMI ports, two USB-A, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. You also get loud speakers and a remote for easy control. And just in case you want to keep this setup simple, you can also rely on productivity apps built for webOS such as Microsoft 365 and a handful of useful Google applications. Of course, you're going to get the best experience if you're using a PC or laptop hooked up to this monitor, but having the option is always nice. So if you've been looking for something like this and want to get a good deal on it, grab it now during Amazon's Big Spring Sale. You can now save half off the original retail price which makes it an absolute steal at just $100.",
