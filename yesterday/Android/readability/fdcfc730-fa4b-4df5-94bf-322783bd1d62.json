  "text": "If you’re a social media user in the US, it looks like you now have one less platform to use. This is because TikTok has officially gone offline in the US ahead of the ban that would have come into effect today. For those unfamiliar, TikTok has been fighting the US government over a potential ban of its services in the country. This is because TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a company based in China. The US government has grown increasingly wary of Chinese companies operating in the US over the years, citing concerns over potential spying on its own citizens. The ban also applies to other apps owned by ByteDance, such as Capcut and Lemon8. These apps have since been removed from the respective app stores, including those owned by Apple and Google. Now, there is some potential good news, though. According to the message in the app, it seems that TikTok is hoping that US President-Elect Donald Trump will give the company a reprieve. “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned.” Trump is expected to take office on Monday and it is believed that he will give TikTok a 90-day reprieve. However, what happens after remains to be seen. But for now, the ban is in place and TikTok is offline in the US. Some users have tried workarounds like VPNs but to no avail. A graphic novelist wannabe. Amateur chef. Mechanical keyboard enthusiast. Writer of tech with over a decade of experience. Juggles between using a Mac and Windows PC, switches between iOS and Android, believes in the best of both worlds.
