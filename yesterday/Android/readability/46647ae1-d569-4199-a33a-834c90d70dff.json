Since passwords need to be long and strong for security purposes, and you should not use the same password everywhere, it can be difficult to remember them all. This is where password managers come into the picture. As the name suggests, it is a service that manages passwords on your behalf. They make it easier to log into online accounts without remembering all the passwords. They can also help you in generating unique passwords, alerting you about data breaches, and a lot more.  Here are the best password managers of 2025 you can try. NordPass NordPass is a password manager developed by NordVPN, a renowned VPN provider. Although relatively new to the password manager space, it offers a range of features suitable for both individuals and businesses. The best thing about NordPass is that it has a free tier with unlimited password storage. The only catch is that you can use it only on one device at a time. You get features like passkey support, built-in authenticator, data breach monitoring, and email masking. Its Personal plan includes a Family tier that can have up to six user accounts. NordPass is available on all major operating systems and web browsers. 1Password 1Password is one of the oldest and well-known password managers. It offers seamless autofill functionality across compatible platforms. The process of sharing items securely with others is also easy to follow. It has a unique Travel Mode that, when enabled, temporarily erases items from the app that you have not marked safe for travel. Do note that 1Password does not offer a free plan, and its family plan can have up to five members. It is also available across a wide range of platforms and web browsers. Dashlane Dashlane is a password manager best suited for families with over six members. This is because its Family plan supports up to 10 members. Other than that, its premium plans are on the expensive side as compared to other options in the market. As for features, it has all the common features you would expect from a password manager. It also has dark web monitoring and a built-in VPN. Dashlane offers a free tier, but limited to up to 25 passwords and only one device. BitWarden BitWarden continues to be the best pick for anyone looking for a free or affordable password manager. Its free tier is undoubtedly the best out there. You get vault storage, unlimited password storage, and unlimited devices with the free tier. It is open-source and is said to get audited annually by third-party cybersecurity firms. The paid plans offer advanced features like integrated authenticator, file attachments, and emergency access. There is no compromise on the platform availability either. Keeper Keeper password manager does not have a free tier if you are looking for that. Its individual tier is packed with features like unlimited password storage, unlimited devices and sync, unlimited secure password sharing, and unlimited identity and payments. The family plan offers additional benefits like 10GB secure file storage and five private vaults. You can further have add-ons for extra perks, but that will inflate the bill.
