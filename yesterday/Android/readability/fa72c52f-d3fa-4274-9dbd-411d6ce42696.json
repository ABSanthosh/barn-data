  "text": "Android beta users, rejoice – Google recently announced that it’s launched Android 16’s third beta update, which is expected to feature big enhancements to overall platform stability. This means that there’s only one beta update left before Android 16’s official launch, which is expected a few months away from now, around June. READ: Google confirms Android 16 on track for a June release With that said, the third Android 16 beta version comes with updates to accessibility features such as support for Auracast broadcast audio which in turn will work with LE audio hearing aids, text outlines for users with low vision, and “Local Network Protection,” which provides users with better control over apps can access devices on their local networks. Android 16 is expected to arrive for Google Pixel devices first, which will include the upcoming Pixel 10 and Pixel 9a phones, both of which have been leaked into oblivion over the past weeks. Previously, Google released its new phones and Android upgrades over the fall, although this is now obviously changing this year. The last beta update before Android 16’s full release (scheduled for April) will iron out any remaining bugs and issues.",
