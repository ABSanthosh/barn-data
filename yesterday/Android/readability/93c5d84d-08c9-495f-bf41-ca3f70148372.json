  "text": "TriliumNext is arguably one of the best open-source note-taking apps out there. It works on Windows and Windows on ARM, macOS, Linux, and it comes with a ton of features you might not expect. A developer also created a Trilium Sender app for Android devices. However, the best thing about TriliumNext is that you can build a whole knowledge base and self-host notes. Here are a few reasons why you should self-host TriliumNext Notes, especially now that you can do that on an inexpensive device like a Raspberry Pi. Related 5 Enhanced privacy and security You can closely keep an eye on your notes Keeping data on your server is obviously a lot safer than trusting it to a cloud service or even internal storage. By self-hosting TriliumNext Notes, you have full control over your data and the means to protect it. You can implement encryption, secure your server with strong passwords, and set up firewalls to prevent unauthorized access. This ensures that your sensitive information remains private and protected from potential data breaches or third-party access. Moreover, TriliumNext comes with syncing and database backup scheduling features that help you save all your data automatically. You may argue that it’s a costly endeavor, but it’s not the case. You can start your server on an older PC or even a tiny Raspberry PI that you can hold in your hand. After that, you can use it to self-host other processes and applications. Related TriliumNext Notes is still my favorite self-hosted note-taking app TriliumNext Notes was the first note-taking tool I covered in-depth here on XDA, and despite switching between different self-hosted solutions, I keep returning to it. Sure, Vikunja, Joplin, BookStack, and Silverbullet have their perks, but TriliumNext Notes has the perfect set of features for my needs. In addition to its hardcore link maps and node-based file structure, TriliumNext Notes supports mermaid diagrams, Excalidraw, and Markdown documents. The best part? It has a simple and straightforward UI that's powerful enough to serve as a dedicated personal knowledge management platform. 4 Offline access and data ownership No need for an internet connection to check your notes An obvious advantage of a self-hosted solution is that you can access your notes even when you don't have an internet connection. This is particularly useful if you work in remote locations or travel frequently. You can synchronize your notes when you have connectivity and work offline when needed. Clearly, this also works as a protection feature as well. If you unplug your server and power it off after you sync the data, you will still have the database safe and away from any possible attack. Plus, self-hosting ensures that you retain full ownership of your data. You can back up your notes regularly, export them in various formats, and migrate them to other platforms if necessary. This level of control over your data is not always possible with cloud-based services. 3 Better performance You can configure your server as you want Hosting TriliumNext Notes on your own server can translate into better performance and faster access times. You can optimize your server for your specific use case, ensuring that the TriliumNext runs smoothly and efficiently. Of course, this is important only if you have large databases or complex note structures. However, if you’re using TriliumNext to collaborate on notes inside the organization, and have a large database, self-hosting will make a huge difference in performance and access speed. You will also have better control over the resources and be able to expand your server's capabilities as needed. 2 Flexibility for integration and scalability You can upgrade it to meet your needs Self-hosting allows you to integrate TriliumNext Notes with other self-hosted applications and services. For instance, you can create a workflow by connecting it with tools like Nextcloud for file storage, Docker for containerization, and some automation tools. Moreover, TriliumNext is open-source, so you can change it however you please to reach your desired outcome. Apart from that, as I mentioned above, if you need more storage, processing power, or additional features, you can upgrade your server to meet your growing demands. This scalability ensures that your note-taking system can grow according to your needs. 1 Cost savings and customization Self-hosting can be a lot cheaper in the long run While there may be initial costs associated with setting up and maintaining a server, self-hosting can save you money in the long run. The recurring subscription fees associated with cloud-based services will add up and sometimes, they may exceed those initial costs for an in-house server. Plus, self-hosting allows you to modify the TriliumNext Notes application to meet your specific needs. You can change the user interface, add custom features, and integrate it with other tools. This level of customization is often not possible with cloud-based solutions, giving you the freedom to tailor the application to your workflow. TriliumNext When should you self-host TriliumNext notes? Whether or not you should self-host TriliumNext notes depends on the amount of content and resources you have. If you're the IT manager of a small organization, you should definitely do this. That's because you may already have a PC that you can quickly transform into a hosting server and set up. That's also a good idea if you want to create a knowledge base for your organization. However, if you want to lash out and create a communication and collaboration platform and host large databases of notes, you might want to consider outsourcing offers. Many of the advantages I listed above still stand, but you also have to consider the upkeep and management costs.",

covered in-depth here on XDA, and despite switching between different self-hosted solutions, I keep returning to it. Sure, Vikunja, Joplin, BookStack, and Silverbullet have their perks, but TriliumNext Notes has the perfect set of features for my needs. In addition to its hardcore link maps and node-based file structure, TriliumNext Notes supports mermaid diagrams, Excalidraw, and Markdown documents. The best part? It has a simple and straightforward UI that\u0026#39;s powerful enough to serve as a dedicated personal knowledge management platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\n\n                    \n\n\n

This is particularly useful if you work in remote locations or travel frequently.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eYou can synchronize your notes when you have connectivity and work offline when needed. Clearly, this also works as a protection feature as well. If you unplug your server and power it off after you sync the data, you will still have the database safe and away from any possible attack. Plus, self-hosting ensures that you retain full ownership of your data. You can back up your notes regularly, export them in various formats, and migrate them to other platforms if necessary. This level of control over your data is not always possible with cloud-based services.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"better-performance\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e3 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Better performance\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"you-can-configure-your-server-as-you-want\"\u003e\n            You can configure your server as you want\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                                        \n    \n    \n    \u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/proxmox-home-lab-1.jpg\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\"\u003e\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n        \u003cpicture\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/proxmox-home-lab-1.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/proxmox-home-lab-1.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/proxmox-home-lab-1.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/proxmox-home-lab-1.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 481px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/proxmox-home-lab-1.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/proxmox-home-lab-1.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/proxmox-home-lab-1.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/proxmox-home-lab-1.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n                \u003cimg width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"A Proxmox home lab\" data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/proxmox-home-lab-1.jpg\" src=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/proxmox-home-lab-1.jpg\"/\u003e\n    \u003c/picture\u003e\n                                    \n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHosting TriliumNext Notes on your own server can translate into better performance and faster access times.
