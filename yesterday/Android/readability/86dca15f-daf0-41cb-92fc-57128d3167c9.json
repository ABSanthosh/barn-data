  "text": "In true Meta fashion, messaging app WhatsApp recently announced that it will begin rolling out ads for users, which will come alongside a couple more updates to the app. The company promises that the ad implementation will retain user privacy in mind, and users’ messages, calls and statuses remain end-to-end encrypted. Part of WhatsApp’s official release states: Like everything we do at WhatsApp, we’ve built these features in the most private way possible. Your personal messages, calls, and statuses remain end-to-end encrypted, meaning no one (not even us) can see or hear them. To show ads in Status or Channels you might care about, we’ll use limited info like your country or city, language, the Channels you’re following, and how you interact with the ads you see. For people that have chosen to add WhatsApp to Accounts Center, we’ll also use your ad preferences and info from across your Meta accounts. READ: WhatsApp for iPad is finally here—and yes, multitasking works Going back to the new updates, users will now be able to support their favourite channels with monthly subscription fees for updates, and WhatsApp will promote new channels that might pique a user’s interest. Admins can also boost their Channel’s visibility to other users moving forward. As for the ads themselves, users will see ads from businesses and certain products via the Status tab, and will be able to get in touch with them directly.",
