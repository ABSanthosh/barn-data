  "text": "Summary The MSI Claw 8 AI+ offers superior performance and storage but it's pricier than the Switch 2. Nintendo Switch 2 offers Nintendo-exclusive games but has less variety than the PC ecosystem. The Claw 8 AI+ uses hall effect technology for its analog sticks, making it almost immune to drift issues compared to Switch 2. Most fans can't wait to get their hands on Nintendo's new Switch 2 after years of anticipation. The new Switch is a huge upgrade over its predecessor and includes new features like enhanced visuals, the GameChat function, and a faster refresh rate. However, the gaming handheld landscape has changed in its eight years of development, and it's no longer the default choice. Countless rivals like the Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally X, and others are now available, and buyers are spoiled for choice. The big question is whether it's worth getting a Switch 2 or choosing another rival? It probably comes down to your budget and gaming preferences, which often overrule specs and logic. As a universal gamer who loves the Switch and other platforms, I still think Nintendo fans should consider the MSI Claw 8 AI+ instead of the Switch 2. Related 5 things PC gaming handhelds can learn from the Nintendo Switch 2 Nintendo may be charging too much, but there's a lot to love with the Switch 2 More power Superior performance and storage space The MSI Claw 8 AI+ is the priciest handheld on the market, but justifies its cost with the best performance. Its Intel Core Ultra 7 CPU paired with 32GB of RAM and an Intel Arc 140V GPU makes it a gaming powerhouse capable of handling the most demanding titles, and should provide a degree of future-proofing. You also get a whopping 1TB M.2 NVMe, which can be easily upgraded or replaced if you have an issue. A micro SD card reader can also expand memory without removing the back panel. While there's no official word yet, the Switch 2's technical details were leaked by YouTuber Geekerman, who got a view of the internals. According to his breakdown, the Switch 2 has a 207mm Nvidia SoC called the T239, with eight A78C CPU cores. The Ampere-based GPU has around 1,536 CUDA cores, which he claims to have similar performance to a downclocked RTX 2050 laptop GPU. The chips are powered by 12GB of LPDDR5X memory. The Switch 2's confirmed 256GB of storage space doesn't come close, despite being upgradable via the new MicroSD Express cards. Related MSI Claw 8 AI+ vs. Nintendo Switch OLED: Which is right for you? MSI's Claw 8 AI+ is a brand-new handheld, but is it better than the OG, the Nintendo Switch? Here's everything you need to know to decide. Hall Effect sticks and triggers No more drift Joy-Con stick drift was one of the biggest complaints about the original Switch, and it seems like the issue is set to continue on the newer model, which uses the same outdated technology. For those who haven't experienced it, stick drift is when the analog sticks move without you touching them. It can often happen to older controllers after significant use and dust or debris buildup. The solution is to replace your Joy-Con thumbsticks yourself or send the controller to Nintendo for a free repair. On the other hand, the Claw 8 AI+ uses modern Hall Effect technology for its sticks and triggers. They are more responsive than a standard controller, have a longer lifespan, and are practically immune to drifting. This is because there's no physical contact between the parts, which use magnets and electrical conductors instead of standard electrical resistance to measure movement and distance. Related Wider game selection Many stores to choose from The Switch 2 will include some Nintendo-exclusive launch titles, like Mario Kart World, and some third-party games, like Hogwarts Legacy, Street Fighter 6, and Cyberpunk 2077, for variety. It's also compatible with the original Switch games, although some, like Fall Guys, Doom: Eternal, and Rocket League, currently have compatibility issues that might be rectified later. The Claw 8 AI+ offers a wider title selection because it can access multiple online stores. You can download games from the Microsoft Store, Steam, Epic Games, Ubisoft, and more, so you'll never run out of new games to play. The Claw 8 AI+ is also compatible with Microsoft Game Pass and can run emulators to play old console games. Game choice is personal, and Nintendo fans will probably stick to their favorite titles on the Switch 2, while those looking for the most options will prefer the Claw 8 AI+. Related Nintendo's Switch 2 is expensive but you paid more for these consoles The Switch 2's price turned heads, but these two Nintendo consoles were more expensive than you remember. The price eventually balances between them Short and long-term costs Both consoles have been criticized for their pricing. The Switch 2 for breaking the $300 price barrier and the Claw 8 AI+ for its eye-watering $1,000 price tag, which puts it in gaming laptop territory. The Claw 8 AI+ might cost twice as much as the Switch 2, but it somewhat makes up for it with superior hardware and storage space. It also offers dual functionality and can work as a Windows mini-PC for browsing, emails, and other tasks. Handheld consoles are primarily for gaming, and the Claw 8 AI+ has a significant advantage regarding software pricing. It can access great deals on titles from numerous stores and the latest Xbox games via Game Pass. Feeding the Switch 2 is a pricier proposition as the games are significantly more expensive, and the Nintendo store isn't known for marked-down prices on its exclusive titles. You'll also need to pay to upgrade your old Switch games, like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, to run at their best on the Switch 2. Should Nintendo fans consider the MSI Claw 8 AI+ instead of the Switch 2? The Claw 8 AI+ costs around double the price of the Switch 2, but offers far superior performance and storage space so that it can double as a mini-PC. It also has access to a wider range of titles, and sweeter deals can help offset its hefty price tag. I think it's the superior choice if you're looking for the largest game selection and best all-around capabilities, as long as you're willing to sacrifice your itch for the Switch. Related",

You also get a whopping 1TB M.2 NVMe, which can be easily upgraded or replaced if you have an issue. A micro SD card reader can also expand memory without removing the back panel.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhile there\u0026#39;s no official word yet, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/someone-got-the-nintendo-switch-2s-hardware-early-and-spilled-all-the-beans/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSwitch 2\u0026#39;s technical details\u003c/a\u003e were leaked by YouTuber Geekerman, who got a view of the internals. According to his breakdown, the Switch 2 has a 207mm Nvidia SoC called the T239, with eight A78C CPU cores. The Ampere-based GPU has around 1,536 CUDA cores, which he claims to have similar performance to a downclocked RTX 2050 laptop GPU. The chips are powered by 12GB of LPDDR5X memory. The Switch 2\u0026#39;s confirmed 256GB of storage space doesn\u0026#39;t come close, despite being upgradable via the new MicroSD Express cards.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n

the newer model, which uses the same outdated technology. For those who haven\u0026#39;t experienced it, stick drift is when the analog sticks move without you touching them. It can often happen to older controllers after significant use and dust or debris buildup. The solution is to \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/stick-drift-sucks-heres-how-to-replace-your-nintendo-joycon-thumbsticks/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ereplace your Joy-Con thumbsticks\u003c/a\u003e yourself or send the controller to Nintendo for a free repair.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, the Claw 8 AI+ uses modern Hall Effect technology for its sticks and triggers. They are more responsive than a standard controller, have a longer lifespan, and are practically immune to drifting. This is because there\u0026#39;s no physical contact between the parts, which use magnets and electrical conductors instead of standard electrical resistance to measure movement and distance.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n                                        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n                \n

The Switch 2 for breaking the $300 price barrier and the Claw 8 AI+ for its eye-watering $1,000 price tag, which puts it in gaming laptop territory. The Claw 8 AI+ might cost twice as much as the Switch 2, but it somewhat makes up for it with superior hardware and storage space. It also offers dual functionality and can work as a Windows mini-PC for browsing, emails, and other tasks.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eHandheld consoles are primarily for gaming, and the Claw 8 AI+ has a significant advantage regarding software pricing. It can access great deals on titles from numerous stores and the latest Xbox games via Game Pass. Feeding the Switch 2 is a pricier proposition as the games are significantly more expensive, and the Nintendo store isn\u0026#39;t known for marked-down prices on its exclusive titles. You\u0026#39;ll also need to pay to upgrade your old Switch games, like \u003cem\u003eThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\u003c/em\u003e, to run at their best on the Switch 2.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch3 id=\"should-nintendo-fans-consider-the-msi-claw-8-ai-instead-of-the-switch-2\"\u003e\n            Should Nintendo fans consider the MSI Claw 8 AI+ instead of the Switch 2?\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Claw 8 AI+ costs around double the price of the Switch 2, but offers far superior performance and storage space so that it can double as a mini-PC. It also has access to a wider range of titles, and sweeter deals can help offset its hefty price tag. I think it\u0026#39;s the superior choice if you\u0026#39;re looking for the largest game selection and best all-around capabilities, as long as you\u0026#39;re willing to sacrifice your itch for the
