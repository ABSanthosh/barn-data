  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Today we got news that Google's Gemini is coming to more devices with support for Android Auto and Google TV. Samsung also dropped its own news that it will be releasing Gemini for some of its popular accessories like the Galaxy Watch and Galaxy Buds 3 earbuds. While the brand didn't reveal a date, it said that Gemini would arrive in the \"coming months.\" The Android Show gave us some early news ahead of Google I/O, including the major reveal that Gemini would be coming to more devices. While being able to use Gemini with Android Auto and Google TV is going to be a pretty huge change, it appears that Samsung will also provide access to Gemini, introducing it on some of its popular accessories. Related Samsung announced the news through its own website, sharing that its Galaxy Watch lineup would \"get even smarter\" with the addition of Google's Gemini. In addition to its wearables, the brand will also bring access to Gemini to its Galaxy Buds 3 earbuds. For the most part, this is a pretty good move since Samsung has already made Gemini available on its smartphones. Samsung's hardware is getting better As far as what to expect, simply put, you'll be able to interact with your devices in a more natural way, asking your products to do this or that, and having them actually follow through without any issues. The same will apply to both Galaxy Watches and the Galaxy Buds 3 earbuds. As far as when this change will come, Samsung has only shared that it will arrive in the \"coming months.\" Samsung's had a pretty big year when it comes to hardware and software. The brand got off to a strong start with its Galaxy S25 series, and even released a new update to older phones with One UI 7. Furthermore, the Galaxy S25 Edge was finally revealed in full, being a flagship-level phone that's just 5.8mm thin. For the most part, things have been pretty good for the brand, despite many still complaining that it has stagnated. Luckily, we're heading into summer, which means that we'll soon get some new foldables. And there are already rumors that this year should be an exciting one, with Samsung potentially delivering some of its thinnest folding phones yet. Of course, we'll just have to wait and see, but from what we can see, there's already a lot to look forward to in terms of hardware and software from Samsung. If you have an Android phone or tablet, and have yet to give Gemini a try, we recommend taking a look.",
