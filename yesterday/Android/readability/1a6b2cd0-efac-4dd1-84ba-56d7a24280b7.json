With that said, it also comes with enhancements to on-device AI, a tech trend that’s seen a continuous rise in the past couple of years. READ: Snapdragon 8 Elite benchmarks blow the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 out of the water Speaking of the latter, Honor recently announced that its upcoming Magic7 series phones will come with Autopilot AI, a software-based approach that combines on-device AI with the capabilities of the Snapdragon 8 Elite to provide users with what it refers to as “the industry’s first on-device AI Agent for an open ecosystem.” Ray Guo, CMO at Honor comments: Openness and collaboration are in our DNA… With this collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies, we are defining the AI-first ecosystem and revolutionizing user experiences for the AI era. We are thrilled to introduce the industry’s first AI Agent for an open ecosystem, and bring on-device generative AI to gaming powered by NPU computing for the first time. Welcome to the era of Autopilot AI for mobile. With Autopilot AI, Honor says that the Magic7 handsets will be capable of various tasks which use generative AI, including adapting to a user’s preferences for recipes for examples, and can even handle mundane everyday tasks such as booking and scheduling tickets, cancelling subscriptions and more, all with a simple voice prompt. For gaming, the Magic7 phones will also support on-device generative AI, which works around NPU computing. Honor describes this as a real-time AI graphics rendering solution for mobile games, and reduces GPU load for better thermal management and performance overall. We can expect the Honor Magic7 series to make its debut in China on October 30. A writer and content creator with a love for tech and music, Mike is also an avid gamer as well. He and his wife are big fans of Mario Kart. Snapdragon 8 Elite benchmarks blow the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 out of the waterPrevious article More in Devices",
