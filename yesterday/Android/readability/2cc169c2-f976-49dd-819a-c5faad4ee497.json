First teased yesterday, the Android 16 Beta 4 update is now available to all of Google’s still-supported Pixel devices. This will be the last scheduled update in Google’s Android 16 beta program, which includes the latest fixes and optimizations, as well as making the beta available on more devices. As far as what’s new in this Beta 4 build, Google didn’t reveal anything in their developer blog post. There is a chance that we get almost nothing new, since this is as close to a final build as we’ll see before it goes stable, likely at Google I/O in May. Google has posted the image files. The over-the-air update has started as build BP22.250325.007. DOWNLOAD ANDROID 16 BETA 4 ON PIXEL: For those looking to get Beta 4 up and running on your supported Pixel device, it’s easy to do since the Android Beta Program is available. Of course, you could flash images and go through all of that, you just don’t have to. At this point, we are well into the Android 16 Beta program and the updates arrive over-the-air. Release date: April 17, 2025 Build: BP22.250325.007 Emulator support: x86 (64-bit), ARM (v8-A) Security patch level: April 2025 Google Play services: 25.07.33 Here’s the full list of Android 16 Beta devices: Pixel 6 and 6 Pro Pixel 6a Pixel 7 and 7 Pro Pixel 7a Pixel Fold Pixel Tablet Pixel 8 and 8 Pro Pixel 8a Pixel 9 Pixel 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, and 9 Pro Fold Pixel 9a And here are your options to get Android 16 Beta 3 on your device: Easiest way: If you own one of those devices, the easiest way to get Android 16 Beta 4 is to sign-up for the Android Beta Program (here). You’ll simply click the “Opt In” button next to your device on that page to join and then sit back and wait for Google to push an update as Android 16 over-the-air. Already on an Android 16 Beta build: If you are already on an Android 16 Beta build, Google says that you will receive the Beta 4 update over-the-air. Of course, you can manually flash a factory image or OTA file as well, since the over-the-air process often takes forever to process. Flash an image: Want to get updated in the fastest possible way by flashing a factory image or OTA file through adb? That’s always an option! I’ll be going the OTA route, but factory images will be available too. You’ll find Android 16 Beta 4 factory images here and the OTA files here. For instructions on how to flash a factory image, here you go. For instructions on how to flash an OTA .zip file, here you go. Finally, here are the bug fixes: Developer- and user-reported issues Fixed issue that caused the radar map to disappear in the Pixel weather app. (Issue# 407282089) Fixed issues that impacted haptic performance and delayed feedback (Issues # 400455826, 398829454) Fixed issue that caused excessive power drain on some devices (Issue # 395519809) Fixed issue that caused a system restart when a call was answered in some situations (Issue # 402639338) Fixed issue that caused restart when screen magnification is enabled (Issue # 408330740) Fixed issue where screen saver did not start (Issue # 398963286) Fixed issue where phone restarted when ranging API used (Issue # 406577030) Other resolved issues Fixed various other issues that impacted system stability and performance, including a launcher crash // Android Developers",
