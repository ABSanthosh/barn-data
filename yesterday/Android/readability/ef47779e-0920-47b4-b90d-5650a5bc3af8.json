  "text": "While most Snapdragon fans have had their eyes set on the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset (and for good reason), Qualcomm isn’t putting all its eggs into one basket – in fact, the company recently unveiled its new Snapdragon Cockpit Elite and Ride Elite platforms, which are designed for more intuitive driving experiences. Both platforms come equipped with Qualcomm’s own Oryon CPU, which is also found on the Snapdragon 8 Elite. With that said, the Snapdragon Cockpit Elite is designed to give passengers more immersive infotainment experiences, and the Ride Elite focuses on running entire vehicle systems. Qualcomm says that these new platforms are ideal for manufacturers who want to focus on software-defined vehicles (aka SDVs), and want to give passengers a more “futuristic” riding and driving experience somewhat akin to modern electric vehicles these days, with an added boost of AI. The chips are also capable of supporting different operating systems, making them a bit different than their Android-focused counterparts, for example. This means better software experiences which will replace clunky and outdated default UIs in most current vehicle infotainment systems. There’s also a focus on safety and complex multimodal sensors, with as much as 20 cameras for simultaneous 360-degree monitoring, and better power efficiency as well. Nakul Duggal, group general manager for automotive, industrial and cloud at Qualcomm comments: Qualcomm Technologies remains at the forefront of innovation with platforms like Snapdragon Cockpit Elite and Snapdragon Ride Elite, as the automotive industry evolves towards centralized computing, software-defined vehicles and AI-driven architectures… With our strongest performing compute, graphics and AI capabilities, coupled with industry leading power efficiency and cutting-edge software enablement for digital cockpits and automated driving, these new elite Snapdragon automotive platforms address the industry’s needs for higher compute levels, empowering automakers to redefine automotive experiences for their customers. We can expect Qualcomm’s new automotive platforms to be available for sampling next year, with big names such as Li Auto and Mercedes-Benz AG expected to integrate the new Snapdragon systems into their upcoming cars.
