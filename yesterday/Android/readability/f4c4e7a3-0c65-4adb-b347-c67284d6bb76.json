  "text": "NAS, IOT, and everything else Sign in to your XDA account Building a network-attached storage (NAS) enclosure is a great way to learn how everything works, including hardware. Regardless of which operating system you choose to run your server with, there are some steps to take once everything is up and running. From setting static IP addresses to installing Docker containers, here are some helpful pointers on things to do once you've set up a NAS. 5 Assign a static IP address to the NAS Make it more accessible You've just built your NAS and your LAN assigned a lovely new IP address, but this can change depending on how many devices you have connecting to the network, how often you power down the NAS, and other factors relating to how the DHCP server works. To help make it easier to connect to your NAS, be it from other devices or through software, we can tell our DHCP server to assign and reserve an IP address for our storage enclosure. It's possible to set this up on the NAS but I recommend assigning static IPs through the router. You can then configure any clients to use this IP and it will be valid until you release it back to the IP pool. Related 4 Configure your NAS for software updates Keep everything updated Running outdated software is no fun, especially regarding the OS. As soon as you're logged into the web interface, configure updates to be automatically installed for the OS. It's also worth manually checking for new versions while you're here. Once you've started to install software and Docker containers, it's vital to check for updates and install when necessary to keep everything secure. There's nothing worse than running outdated software that can cause security risks for your NAS and the entire network. This is something to consider when opening up your NAS to external access. 3 Create user accounts Don't forget one for yourself! Some NAS operating systems may have you using an admin account when installing everything but it's best practice to keep this for emergencies and create a user account for yourself and everyone else who needs to access the NAS. Permissions can be granted to provide you with the same administrative access as the admin account, but it helps to keep everything secure. Once a few accounts have been created, storage limits can be adjusted, access to various apps and services is granted, and the NAS can become the center of your home. 2 Install some apps or Docker containers Transform your NAS into a homelab server! Your NAS can do so much more than store data. This powerful device can run services and software to create instances that can save you money and bring everything under direct control. Enjoy using Bitwarden as your password manager? Why not install a local server on your NAS and use it to store all your credentials? Pi-hole or other ad blockers can also run on a NAS to filter all your web traffic. Considerably more advanced routes are available for setting up your own home security surveillance system or media streaming service. You can even replace Google Docs with Nextcloud! 1 Back up all your devices Keep your data safe You don't want to lose anything, so back up all your devices. Save a copy in the cloud or utilize your new NAS to back up all your hardware. If you haven't already, read up on our 3-2-1 backup rule to protect your data from natural disasters, drive failure, and malicious parties. The best part is you won't be required to do anything as all anyone requires is a user account, and access to their home partition on the NAS, and everything can be configured on a per-device basis. Also, I recommend configuring automatic backups to negate the need for human input. A NAS is much more than storage NAS used to be precisely that; somewhere to store files on the network. That's no longer the case and modern NAS enclosures are more like servers than simple storage devices. You can run game servers, media streaming platforms, surveillance recording utilities, and much more from the same device. The trusty NAS has become a powerful tool in creating a smarter home and when putting your first enclosure together, it's important to get it right so you don't cause issues down the line. Following these helpful tips will ensure you're off to a good start!",
