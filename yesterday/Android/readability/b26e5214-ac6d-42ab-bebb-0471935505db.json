  "text": "Garmin Garmin Epix Gen 2 Garmin's Epix Gen 2 smartwatch is now down to its lowest price, and it also comes with two-year enhanced warranty coverage too. Garmin's Epix smartwatches are some of the best wearables in the brand's lineup. And while it tends to offer the best features, it can be pretty expensive with a retail price starting at $900. Of course, we're not in the habit of having Android Police readers paying full price for the tech they want, which is why this deal is one that you don't want to pass up with a discount that knocks $400 off for a limited time.

Those that want to take things further can even utilize the Garmin Coach that will keep you on task in order to achieve your goals. And while you might be working out at home, you can also take things outdoors and still track all the data you need thanks to accurate location tracking. There are maps for cities, trails, mountains and even the slopes.
