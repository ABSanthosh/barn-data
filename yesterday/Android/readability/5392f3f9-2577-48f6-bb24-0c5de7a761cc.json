The company gave up on tablets in 2019 before it teased the Pixel Tablet in 2022 and then released it last year, and now it looks like it's ready to give up on the form factor yet again. According to a new report supposedly coming from \"multiple industry sources close to the project\", Google has decided to cancel the development of the Pixel Tablet 3, codenamed internally as Kiyomi. The decision was apparently made last week, which is when all of the teams involved found out about it. People who have been working on the Pixel Tablet 3 have been reassigned to other projects within Google. So it looks like the upcoming Pixel Tablet 2 will be Google's last tablet, at least for a while. The good news is that it might have an official first-party keyboard case, unlike its predecessor. The bad news is that it's not getting a successor. This news clearly indicates that Google's heart simply wasn't in the tablet space even this time around. The company has weirdly shied away from integrating useful tablet-specific features into Android, letting Apple basically run away with the entire market. But fret not for Google's amazing plan to compete with iPads is apparently merging Chrome OS into Android and launching a laptop. We wish we were making this stuff up. If anyone can make any sense out of Google's strategy at this point, please enlighten us in the comments. Source",
