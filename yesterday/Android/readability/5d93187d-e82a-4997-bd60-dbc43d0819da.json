Other than that, leaks have suggested that the K80 series will come with price hikes, and the Pro's price will rise the most. That's not great news, but on the other hand he also revealed that the K80 line's top model will use Qualcomm's next flagship chipset (Snapdragon 8 Elite) and a 6,000 mAh battery. If you've read this far, you're wondering why you've never heard of the Redmi K series before. It's because it's only sold in China under this name. Internationally, devices in this line often get rebranded as part of the Poco F series, and the news regarding price hikes certainly doesn't bode well for the next Poco F models. Source",
