That’s why services like Apple’s Apple Care subscription thrive as it gives users some extra reassurance should something go wrong with their smartphone. READ: Oppo Now Offers a Repair Service for Find X8 Devices As it turns out, other companies like Oppo have also started to adopt a similar approach to giving customers, such as its dedicated Repair Service for the Find X8 which was announced a while back. Oppo has more recently followed up on this service after announcing that it will be offering a similar service for the Oppo Find N5. The company says that its “Oppo Service” will provide N5 owners with access to exclusive hotlines and premium lanes for more convenient and personalized services, especially when dealing with issue with their devices. This also include Oppo Care and other premium services which can be customized according to a user’s particular needs. READ: OnePlus offers lifetime warranty for green lines on its displays For select regions such as Malaysia for example, Oppo Find N5 users have access to complimentary screen protectors, send-in repair services and even loan phones. Oppo Service also provides users with international warranty services with over 75 Oppo service centers in different countries worldwide, so long as the N5 is “officially” sold through Oppo in that region.
