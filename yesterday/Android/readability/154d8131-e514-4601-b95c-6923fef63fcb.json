Simply plug your mount into the power source and forget about it. Next time you need to take a drive, just drop it into the mount and it will start charging.Scosche is a very respected accessory brand, so the quality is good. Additionally, it has a 360-degree rotating design, so you can play with your phone’s orientation as you wish.At just $20 bucks, this is pretty much the price of an average meal, and it will make your driving experience much more convenient. We say it is worth the investment. I swear I can’t go back to a regular phone holder anymore! Go catch this deal before it is gone. It’s a “clearance” offer, and those don’t usually last long!",
