Yesterday, a benchmark run of the US-bound model surfaced with the Exynos 2500 on board, and that seemed to settle things regarding regional availability - in short, it looked like the Exynos would be in worldwide.

Samsung Galaxy Z Flip6This report also reconfirms recent rumors that said the Galaxy Z Fold7 would go with the Snapdragon 8 Elite worldwide. So, at the moment, the situation is very confusing. But, regardless of where exactly we'll see the Exynos 2500 inside the Flip7, it clearly will be powering the device at least in some markets. This will be the first time Samsung has used one of its own chipsets in a foldable smartphone, so it's a pretty major milestone for the company. And it finally gives the Exynos 2500 a very belated debut - it was initially developed to be powering the Galaxy S25 family, but that didn't happen due to its yield issues at the time.
