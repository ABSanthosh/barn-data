The Korean company's next flagship tablet will employ MediaTek's Dimensity 9400+ SoC, which is revealed by the 3.73 GHz Prime core. That said, the results this prototype managed are far from what you'd expect from this chipset, but that can most likely be because this is a very early prototype and Samsung is still tuning things.

Speaking of which, the Tab S10 Ultra came out in October after an announcement in late September, and that timeline might repeat this year. If it does, Samsung will have an issue since the Dimensity 9500 is seemingly going to be announced earlier in September, according to the latest rumors. That won't be a good look - Samsung launching its flagship tablet using an SoC that will no longer be MediaTek's flagship. But of course only time will tell how things actually go. We'll let you know when we find out more. Via",
