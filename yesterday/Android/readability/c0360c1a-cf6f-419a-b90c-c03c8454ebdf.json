This is basically going to be a special version of the Galaxy Z Flip6 for the Chinese market, featuring an entirely new back design, which you can see in the images below. Samsung W25 Flip pictures from TENAA These pictures have surfaced courtesy of the W25 Flip's certification in China by TENAA. This is an obligatory step before sales start. The Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition may end up being sold in China as the Samsung W25, by the way. That one has the model number SM-W9025, whereas the W25 Flip gets SM-W7025. The Flip has the same dimensions as the Galaxy Z Flip6, but comes in at a heftier 198g, most likely owing to different materials being used. The device comes with a 6.7-inch 1080x2640 folding touchscreen, a 3.4\" cover display, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset at the helm, 12GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, a 50 MP main camera, a 12 MP secondary camera, and a 10 MP selfie snapper.
