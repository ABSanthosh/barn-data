Make sure to do so before adding any of these portable power stations to your cart.Anker SOLIX C200 DC Portable Power Station Let’s start with the most affordable one. The Anker SOLIX C200 DC Portable Power Station is a pretty nice entry-level model. It features a large 60,000mAh battery, which is enough to charge your average smartphone about 13 times. It’s also very fast, able to output a total of 200W.The unit features five charging ports: three USB-C and two USB-A ports. Both USB-A ports can power devices at up to 12W. Things get much faster once you move to the USB-C ports, though. These can charge at 15W, 100W, and 140W. The second and third ports are powerful enough to fast charge any smartphone, tablet, and most laptops.If you’re not within reach of an outlet or car socket, this portable power station can also keep you powered off the grid, with support for a 100W solar panel. It also helps that it’s relatively portable—or at least it’s the most portable power station on this list. It measures 3.9 × 4.3 × 7.3in and weighs 4.2lbs.Anker SOLIX C300 Portable Power Station If you don’t mind carrying a larger 6.5 x 6.3 x 9.5in and heavier 9.1lbs power station, the Anker SOLIX C300 is quite the treat. This one has a 288Wh battery, which stores enough juice to charge a smartphone about 19 times.It’s also much faster, with a max output of 300W, or 600W surge peaks. It has three USB-C ports, of which two can reach 140W. There’s also a single 12W USB-A port, as well as three 300W AC outlets and a 120W car socket.Needless to say, you can fast charge any smartphone, tablet, or laptop. Most times, you can reach max charging speeds using the USB-C ports, but if you need more wattage, you can always switch to an AC outlet. Just make sure you have a suitable charger. By the way, this power station also supports 100W solar panels.Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 Portable Power Station Now, those of you with more demanding needs will want to upgrade to a much more serious power station, such as the Jackery Explorer 1000 v2. This is a beast, featuring a huge 1070Wh battery that can charge an average smartphone about 74 times!This one also takes speeds to a whole other level. It has a maximum output of 1,500W, with 3,000W surge peaks. This means it can charge any mobile device at full speeds, but that is only part of the fun. It can also run power-hungry appliances like a fridge, coffee machine, heater, and more.You get two USB-C ports, one of which can charge at 100W and the other at 30W. There are also three AC outlets, which can provide 1,500W. You’ll also get a single 18W USB-A port and a car socket.When it’s time to recharge, you can do so using an AC outlet, a car socket, or up to two 200W solar panels. The only real downside is that it’s pretty big at 9.72 x 8.82 x 12.87in, and it weighs 23.8lbs. It’s a fantastic power station, though. Act quickly if you want to take advantage of any of these power station deals. These coupon deals don’t usually last very long, and the full prices can be pretty high, especially as you start moving to the higher-end models.",
