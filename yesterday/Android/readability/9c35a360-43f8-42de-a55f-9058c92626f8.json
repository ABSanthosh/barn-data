  "text": "Ryan Haines / Android AuthorityTL;DR Oxygen OS 15 stable has arrived a week early for the OnePlus 12 Access is available in IN/NA/EU/GLO markets, and should reach all compatible phones by the end of the week. OnePlus has had to delay some AI features, which are due to land before December. Every phone manufacturer has its own approach to Android platform updates — some are faster to release than others, and some take the time to customize the software to make it really feel their own. Miraculously, OnePlus seems to be quite adept at filling both those roles, and it was one of the first companies we saw get going with Android 15 betas. Last month we saw the formal debut of both the OnePlus 13 and the Android-15-based Oxygen OS 15. Now just over a week later, we’re seeing that release start hitting the company’s existing lineup.OnePlus wasn’t planning to have Oxygen OS 15 ready to hit stable for the OnePlus 12 for another week from now, but the company wrapped things up early, and rather than sit on things any longer than it has to, today announces that Oxygen OS 15 for the OnePlus 12 is now available (via Android Police).This is no overly slow, cautious release, either, and OnePlus has hit “go” on the update for OnePlus 12 owners in North America, Europe, India, and global markets alike. While availability will proceed in batches over the course of the next few days, that’s a pretty wide net to be casting.You’ll want to check out our Oxygen OS 15 overview as well as the company’s changelog for full details on what to expect — if you’re not game for just hitting the ground running and learning from using it. OnePlus does temper expectations a little bit with a warning about AI availability: To provide the signature fast and smooth OnePlus experience, AI-related features are still being tested and will be gradually integrated in future versions by the end of this month. Considering how the Open Beta for this hardware only got started a matter of days ago, and we’re already looking at a stable release, we’re not about to get picky about a few features still waiting in the wings — especially if we can look forward to them arriving within a few more weeks.Expect the OnePlus 12R, OnePlus Open, and OnePlus Pad 2 to be next in line for a stable release of their own.Got a tip?
