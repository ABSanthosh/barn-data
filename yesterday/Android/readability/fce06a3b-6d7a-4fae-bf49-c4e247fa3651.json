It’s about time Google launched a new tablet. The first Pixel Tablet they released in 2023 brought unique features, but it quickly fell behind flagship competitors like OnePlus and Samsung. These brands have outpaced Google with more powerful hardware, better displays, and advanced accessories in the OnePlus Pad, Pad 2, and Galaxy Tab S10 series.  Suppose the recent rumors about the Pixel Tablet 2 are true. In that case, it looks like Google is finally addressing these shortcomings and wants to offer a device that’s not just functional but genuinely competitive in the premium tablet market. Pixel Tablet 2 gets a keyboard upgrade and maybe a Stylus Google is working on a new Pixel Tablet, but its release is still several months away.  An insider source gave Android Authority the tip and also shared that the tablet will include a keyboard cover, addressing a key criticism of the original Pixel Tablet. The first Pixel Tablet didn't have one, and it made productivity harder. Typing long documents or emails wasn’t as easy without a proper keyboard, and you had to rely on the on-screen keyboard or buy third-party options that didn’t always work well.  Image: Google The keyboard cover will attach to the tablet using pogo pins that securely hold it in place and provide a power connection. It will also work as a stand, letting the tablet stay upright for easier typing or viewing.  A stylus wouldn’t be a bad addition to the Pixel Tablet 2, especially since it was promised for the original model but never materialized. Adding one now brings a more complete and versatile experience, particularly for drawing, writing, and navigation. Image: Google Before now, several developers have spotted the Pixel Tablet 2 with the codename QPR3 in the first beta of Android 14. It had two codenames, “Clementine” and “Kiyomi”, which may be linked to other upcoming Google devices. But it's worth noting that the first Pixel Tablet was developed under the codenames “Tangor” and “Tangorpro”. Related: Why The OnePlus Pad 2 Is Better Value Than The Pixel Tablet Pixel 2 may snap sharper shots  A better camera is in store for you with the Pixel Tablet 2. Google is planning to upgrade from the 8MP lens on the front and back sides of the first model. But the exact details about the new camera aren’t available yet. What we do know is that the device will use a better processor, likely the Tensor G4 used in the Pixel 9 series or possibly the Tensor G5. The original tablet used the Tensor G2. As earlier reported, Google will nerf the Tensor G6 chip to appear in the Pixel 11 series and Pixel Tablet 3. The company wants to solve the ongoing overheating and poor battery life issues in their Pixel phones and balance performance. But to achieve that, the Tensor G6 will make heavy compromises, such as removing ray-tracing support and reducing the number of cores in the chip’s digital signal processor (DSP) and system-level cache (SLC).  Image: Google That's to say that future Pixel products to use the chip, including the Pixel Tablet 3, won’t be as good at tasks compared to the more expensive models. The Tensor G6 is also expected to be cheaper to produce, costing around $65 compared to Qualcomm’s $150 chips. Since Android 15 is ready and should be released for more devices soon, the Pixel Tablet 2 may come with either Android 15 or Android 16. Android 16 is expected to be released in 2025.  Irene is an experienced writer with four years in the Tech, E-commerce, and Food niches.
