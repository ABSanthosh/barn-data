Redmi Note 14 Pro+The 5G-capable Redmi Note 14 will arrive in Europe in Coral Green, Midnight Black, and Lavender Purple and will set you back around €300 for the 8/256GB variant, again similar to what its predecessor went for when it launched. The Redmi Note 14 Pro 4G will go for €312, the Redmi Note 14 Pro 5G for €398, and the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ for €498. All of these will have 8/256GB of RAM/storage. There is, however, an important thing to note here: for the Pro models, these prices are for a bundle with the Redmi Watch 5 Lite. The Redmi Note 14 Pro will be offered in Ocean Blue, Aurora Purple, and Midnight Black, while the Pro+ will come in Frost Blue, Lavender Purple, and Midnight Black. All of the leaked prices are pretty much in line with what the Redmi Note 13 family launched at. The new models are expected to arrive in Europe next month. Source",
