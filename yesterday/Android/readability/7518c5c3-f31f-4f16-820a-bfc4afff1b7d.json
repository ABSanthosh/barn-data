The 'pineapple' motherboard name is the same as the OnePlus 12. The tested device also had 12GB of system memory and was running Android 15, indicating OxygenOS 15 onboard, but that part should be obvious. The device scored on par with the other Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 devices we have tested recently. As with previous generations, the OnePlus 13R will be a cutback version of the OnePlus 13, running slightly older hardware and reduced specs for a lower price. We are nearing the launch of this device and more will be revealed in the coming weeks. Source",
