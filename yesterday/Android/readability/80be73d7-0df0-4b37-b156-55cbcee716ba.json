Console and PC gaming prices are going up, sometimes to ridiculous extents. However one area where costs aren’t often considered is mobile gaming. Yes, free to play titles are widespread on the App Store and Google Play. But premium titles and experiences are still available, and can often cost more than ever. So we’ve teamed up with the trusted and well respected key and card distribution service G2A.COM to discuss how you can save money on your mobile gaming, and even everyday use of your smartphone. Google Play Gift Cards This seems the most obvious place to start, but a Google Play gift card is your ticket to all the best premium experiences an Android device has to offer.  There’s a range of amazing RPGs and Adventures that require you to pay a fee up front, and these arguably offer far more satisfying experiences than any F2P game. And with G2A.COM offering a discount on a range of Google Play gift cards – often saving you up to 79% on the list price – you can try all of these titles for a tiny outlay. iTunes Gift Cards And now we move onto the iOS alternative, the iTunes gift card. Yes this can be used on music via Apple’s devices, but – more importantly – games. And there’s a stack of premium experiences for iPhone and iPad gamers to enjoy, and new ones arrive every week. So with G2A.COM offering up to 46% discounts on the list prices on these cards in some regions, it just makes good sense to check out the site first before you buy anything on iOS.  Apple Arcade iOS devices are also home to one of the most impressive gaming subscription services out there too. Apple Arcade is home to a host of hugely varied titles, from indie darlings to spin offs of established franchises. Many titles originated from Apple Arcade and have found a way onto consoles and PC too, although they all feel most at home on iOS devices. To try the service costs very little as well, with G2A.COM providing discounts on a number of subscriptions. From one to three month terms.  Coins and In-Game Currency As mentioned, free to play gaming is rife in mobile. But in most cases titles require you to spend on in-game items to actually enjoy the experience.  Again G2A.COM can help you there, with one example being via purchasing Diamonds for Mobile Legends – Bang Bang. Having these gives you a massive advantage, gaining you access to not only cosmetic enhancements but also new challenges that can help improve your chances against other players.  Security Apps And finally something a little bit different. G2A.COM can also save you money on making your smartphone a little more secure, whether that’s via browsing the web or playing games online.  Services such as Avast Mobile Security for Android can be found on the site at a huge discount, and helps protect you from a range of malicious viruses. There’s also features to help you locate your device if it gets lost or stolen. The above only touches upon the ways you can save money on mobile gaming via G2A.COM too – so make sure you check out the site yourself and have a browse! Previous Post",
