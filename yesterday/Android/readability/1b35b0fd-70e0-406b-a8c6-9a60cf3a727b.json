With that said though, the rollout will begin for users in the United States, Korea, as well as India. READ: Samsung’s One UI 7 Beta to Arrive for More Devices The One UI 7 beta upgrade bumps up the OS version to Android 15, and also features the March 2025 security patch, although users who want to try out the beta for themselves will need to sign up for via the Samsung Members app. One UI 7 also comes with Samsung’s new AI-based features (in addition to ones from Google), and this beta update in particular comes in at around 4.7 GB. One caveat however is that not all phones in the S23 lineup will get the phone – the S23 FE will be left out, at least for the time being. Earlier on, the One UI 7 beta update was made available for Galaxy Z Fold6 and Z Flip6 users in India, Korea, the U.K. and the United States, which was made available on March 6. Source: GSMArena",
