  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary The Google Merch Shop has released a new Chrome Dino accessory bundle. The YouTube Skater Pack is limited to 280 pieces and costs $16. This accessory bundle doesn't include the Chrome Dino, which is a separate purchase. The Chrome Dino has been a fun part of Google's browser history for over a decade now, offering those without an internet connection a way to kill time. So if you've been a fan, you'll also probably know that the Google Merch Shop has some excellent items available related to the character, like shirts, pins, and even figures. With that said, the shop has dropped a new item, one that you might want to add to your collection, featuring the Chrome Dino with a skateboard and boombox. Related A cute must-have accessory if you're a fan Source: Google Merch Shop The new merch was spotted by the folks at 9to5Google, and as of this article going up, there's only 280 pieces left for this particular model. The new accessory set comes with the boombox and skateboard. The skateboard has YouTube branding and there is a red and black colored theme across all the accessories. It's cute, and a great product to pick up if you're a fan of the Chrome Dino or even Chrome. Just to be clear though, this is just for the accessories that are shown, which are the skateboard and boombox. If you don't have the base dinosaur, you'll need to pick up the starter set which comes in at $30. The new accessory bundle doesn't come in cheap either, with a price of $16, which is a touch higher than previous accessory packs that have been featured in the past. And while most of these products are limited, they don't tend to sell out quickly, so you'll have some time to decide. If you're in the US, head to the Google Merch Shop to pick up the Chrome Dino, or just check out some other products from Google, like shirts, sweaters, stationery, and special collections as well. If you are a fan of Google or know someone that is, this is the perfect place to shop. And get ready for more news with Google I/O 2025 taking place in a couple of weeks.",
