The Magic V5 is shaping up to be the world’s slimmest and lightest foldable smartphone, taking that title from the OPPO Find N5. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Review (SAVE $400!) Honor has already confirmed a July 2 launch event, but for now, that’s only happening in China. There’s no word yet on when the Magic V5 will get a global release. The Honor Magic V5 teaser images, shared by Abhishek Yadav on X, show off just how sleek the device is. One photo in particular highlights the sharp contrast between the thin body and its oversized circular camera module. It’s thicker than the phone itself when unfolded, but that seems to be the tradeoff. Honor’s previous model, the Magic V3, was already impressively slim at 9.2mm folded and 4.35mm unfolded. But the Magic V5 looks even thinner, aiming to beat the OPPO Find N5’s 8.9mm folded profile. It’s not just for show either. Honor is promising powerful specs under the hood. Early details point to a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, 16GB of RAM, and an LTPO OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. There’s also talk of PC-level productivity features and new AI tools built into the phone. Some leaks hint at a large 6,100mAh silicon-carbon battery with 66W wired charging. Camera-wise, we’re expecting a 50MP main shooter, a 200MP periscope telephoto lens, and an ultrawide. But we’ll know for sure in a couple of weeks. If Honor delivers on the design and power, the Magic V5 could be one of the most compelling foldables of the year. We just hope it doesn’t stay China-only for long.",
