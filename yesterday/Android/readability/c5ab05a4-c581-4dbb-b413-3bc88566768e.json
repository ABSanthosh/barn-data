Now a purported spec list for the upcoming A56 has been outed by a tipster over on X. He claims the phone will be powered by the Exynos 1580 SoC, and will have a 120 Hz refresh rate AMOLED screen with FHD+ resolution, an aluminum frame, and a glass back.

Samsung Galaxy A56 leaked imageSpeaking of which, on that back will be a 50 MP main camera, along with two others: a 12 MP and a 5 MP (we assume the former to be ultrawide and the latter macro). Selfies will be taken care of by a 12 MP camera. The phone will come with 8/12GB of RAM and 128/256GB of storage apparently, as well as a 5,000 mAh battery with support for 45W wired charging. In the UK, the Galaxy A56 is said to start at £439, which is exactly the price its predecessor launched at. With that in mind, we assume there may be no price hikes whatsoever across the globe for this one. Samsung Galaxy A55 Source | Image source",
