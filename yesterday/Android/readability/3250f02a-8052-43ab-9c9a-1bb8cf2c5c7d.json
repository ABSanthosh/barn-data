Whether you are dealing with internet issues or simply desire to go for solo gaming, there are many offline games that provide thrilling gaming experiences and endless entertainment. Here are the best offline games that I love playing on my Windows PC. The following list also includes games from the Steam platform. To play Steam games offline, you must first launch the app and switch to offline mode. The same applies to the games from the Epic Game Store. Also, although all of the following games can be played offline, some require periodic internet access for the latest updates and improvements.

Set in the late 1800s, you take on the role of Arthur Morgan, an outlaw struggling to keep his gang alive while also dealing with his own sense of morality. It is an open world that seems alive, with cities, regions, and mysteries to uncover. What I really love about the game is its level of detail. From dynamic weather systems to lifelike NPC interactions, each instance feels alive. The offline story mode has more than 50 hours of the best missions ever, side missions, and random encounters. However, while playing offline, you will miss out on Red Dead Online, which includes cooperative missions, competitive modes, and community-driven events. Red Dead Redemption Rockstar's latest open-world adventure, set in the tragedy and beauty of the Old West. 14 The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt A sprawling fantasy world filled with adventure The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is often cited as one of the best RPGs of all time, and for a good reason. In the game, you play as Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter traveling a war-torn world searching for his adopted daughter, Ciri. The game features an epic main story accompanied by countless side quests that are as engaging as the main story. The open-world design is magnificent, boasting a variety of regions to explore, from the lively metropolis of Novigrad to the ghostly swamps of Velen. Its offline mode allows you to immerse in its rich lore, strategic combat, and more without any interruption. Thanks to its multiple endings and popular DLCs like Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine, The Witcher 3 has given me hundreds of hours of unforgettable gaming experience. However, it's worth noting that while the offline mode is excellent, the online mods and community-created expansions can add even more to the experience. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt One of the greatest RPG adventures and fantasy games available on this generation of consoles. 13 DOOM Eternal High-octane action and demon-slaying thrills When I want to smash my gamepad's buttons in a turgid fashion, DOOM Eternal is the game that will give me what I crave the most. Your mission as the Doom Slayer is to eliminate hordes of demons and protect Earth from destruction. The quick, brutal combat mixed with puzzle-like level designs has kept me hooked to the game, and I began to level up faster than I thought possible. The single-player campaign is a marvel of game design, with tons of weapons, upgrades, and difficult enemies. From chainsawing demons for ammunition to executing gruesome Glory Kills, DOOM Eternal keeps the action fast and furious every single moment. The offline mode lets me relish the chaos uninterrupted, making it perfect for first-person shooter enthusiasts. However, when offline, you'll miss online multiplayer Battlemode, where one player goes head-to-head against two others who control demons. DOOM Eternal A gloriously violent action game in which you must eradicate a demon invasion personally. 12 Grand Theft Auto V A virtual world of endless possibilities Grand Theft Auto V - Do I need to say more? Its online mode is very popular, but the offline story mode is equally impressive. You have to take on three different characters: Michael, Franklin, and Trevor, who live in the overgrown city of Los Santos and go on intertwined adventures. The game's offline mode allows me to navigate its massive open world, commit heists, and pursue hundreds of side activities like racing, golfing, and even stock-market trading, all at my own pace. With its exceptional graphics, witty writing, and infinite potential for mayhem, GTA V is a benchmark for open-world games. You can also try GTA Online, which includes new missions, updates, and multiplayer fun with friends. Grand Theft Auto V 11 The Sims 4 Create your dream world without internet When I'm in the mood for creativity and simulation, I go to The Sims 4. The game enables me to create my own characters and homes and dictate every detail of their existence. From building careers to forming relationships, there are endless possibilities. While The Sims 4 has lots of online content, its offline mode is still a rich experience. You can explore the base game offerings or expand it with DLC packs. It's a calming, enjoyable way for me to relieve stress and unwind my imagination. The Sims 4 10 Civilization VI A strategy game that spans the ages Civilization VI is a strategy game where your goal is to build an empire that lasts ages. As the head of a civilization, you need to lead your people through the Stone Age to the Information Age, making important choices related to politics, science, and military strategy. The game's turn-based nature makes it well-suited for offline play, allowing you to plan your next move at your own pace. With many ways to achieve victory, including, but not limited to, domination through warfare or conquest of space, the game provides strategy fans like me with immense replay value; Civilization VI by itself is easily its own full-time endeavor. Civilization VI In Civilization VI you slowly progress through human history. In this turn-based strategy game, you must create your own army, develop technology, and interact with other city inhabitants. Unlock new skills, conquer nations, and rule the world. 9 Celeste A heartfelt journey with challenging platforming Celeste is a platformer with solid controls, gorgeous pixel art graphics, and an emotional story about overcoming personal challenges.

Set in the late 1800s, you take on the role of Arthur Morgan, an outlaw struggling to keep his gang alive while also dealing with his own sense of morality. It is an open world that seems alive, with cities, regions, and mysteries to uncover.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhat I really love about the game is its level of detail. From dynamic weather systems to lifelike NPC interactions, each instance feels alive. The offline story mode has more than 50 hours of the best missions ever, side missions, and random encounters. However, while playing offline, you will miss out on \u003cem\u003eRed Dead Online\u003c/em\u003e, which includes cooperative missions, competitive modes, and community-driven events.\u003c/p\u003e
