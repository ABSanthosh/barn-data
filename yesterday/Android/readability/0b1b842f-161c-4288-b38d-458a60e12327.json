  "text": "Google AI Mode update is getting serious. Early users already loved its clean look and fast responses, but now Google’s pushing it even further. Starting today, millions more Labs users in the US are getting access. And with it, something big: full-blown multimodal search powered by Lens. With this Google AI Mode update, you can snap a photo, ask a question, and get detailed answers instantly. Not basic stuff, either. We’re talking about context-rich responses, product comparisons, and deep dive links. Basically, it feels like Google combined Lens with Gemini’s brainpower, and it works. Google’s calling it “query fan-out,” which means AI Mode doesn’t just look at your photo—it picks it apart. Objects, shapes, colors, and even the way they’re arranged. Then, it fires off a bunch of smart queries to give you way more than a simple result. Want to ID books on a shelf and get recommendations? Done. Wondering what plant you just photographed? You’ll get answers and suggestions, plus places to buy it. The update feels like a natural step after years of building visual search. But here’s the best part: AI Mode doesn’t just understand your image; it understands your intent. Google claims this makes answers more nuanced and useful than regular search. This new feature is available in the Google app on Android and iOS. Google is still calling this a test phase, though, and wants feedback. So, if you try it, definitely let them know what you think.",
