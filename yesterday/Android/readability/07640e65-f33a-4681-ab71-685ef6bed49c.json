  "text": "Accessories Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 $16 $30 Save $14 The Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 is the Korean giant's second item tracker, featuring 50% longer battery life, a new design, and SmartThings Find integration. The tracker is IP67 certified and can last up to 700 days for extended item tracking with the new Power Saving Mode. Smart tags are essential if you want to easily and accurately keep track of your belongings. And while they can be expensive, they don't have to be if you know when and where to buy them. If you're someone that owns a Samsung device, the brand's SmartTag 2 is going to be the best option. Related And while one tag will typically cost $30, we're now seeing a fantastic deal from Amazon that knocks the price down to its lowest to date at 47% off its retail price, which brings it down to just $16 for a limited time. This is the best price we've seen for this smart tag so be sure to get it while you still can. What's great about Samsung's SmartTag 2? You really can't go wrong by investing in a smart tag. And for Samsung device owners, the SmartTag 2 is going to be the one. Not only do you get something compact, but it's also quite durable thanks to its fantastic design and also has an IP67 rating as well. But what's really important here is its ability to track things. While you can slip this into a bag or purse, you can also attach it to products using its built-in key ring. Using Samsung's SmartThings app, you'll be able to easily track the smart tags whereabouts. Plus you'll get alerts if you ever leave something behind, and with UWB, you'll get accurate directions to the location of a lost item that has the smart tag attached. And as far as battery life goes, it's absolutely fantastic, with the ability to last up to 700 days if needed. The good news here is that there's no charging required. If you ever have a smart tag that's low on power, you can just pop into a store, buy a common button battery and easily replace it. Perhaps the only drawback of this product is that it is only compatible with Samsung Galaxy devices. So if you've been looking to keep better track of your things, then the Samsung SmartTag 2 is going to be the one to get. Just be sure to act quickly as this deal won't be around for too long. And if you aren't sure, be sure to check out our other smart tag recommendations.",
