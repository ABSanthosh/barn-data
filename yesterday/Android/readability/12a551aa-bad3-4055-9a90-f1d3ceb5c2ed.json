One example is the JBL Tune 510BT, which is currently on sale via Amazon at the moment—the 510BT packs quite a number of features that’ll make you double-check its low asking price. In terms of features, you’re getting a powerful bass sound, easy switching between two different paired devices, up to 40 hours of battery life on a single charge, physical earcup controls, and support for smart assistant access including Google Assistant and Siri.
