Samsung sure made us all wait for One UI 7. Besides those who have Samsung devices that were launched in 2025, the rest of us have been waiting for the overhauled OS to come our way, but Samsung was notably quiet about it. Thankfully, the company just let us know that One UI 7 will finally start rolling out on April 7th. However, in that post, while Samsung mentioned a bunch of its older flagships and a tablet or two, there were many other flagships that should have been on the list (such as the Galaxy S22 Ultra that I daily), which weren't. Thankfully, that list wasn't exhaustive, and Samsung has just silently expanded that list. The List of Samsung Devices Due for One UI 7 Has Gotten Healthily Larger Image; Samsung When Samsung finally broke its long silence on One UI 7 and its older smartphones, it let us in on two important things. The first of those was that the update would start rolling out to the Galaxy S24 series and the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6 on April 7th, but there was not exact date for the rest. And speaking of “the rest,” the other devices mentioned as eligible for the update were part of a list a lot more limited than expected. That was particularly worrying to me since I have a Galaxy S22 Ultra, and the South Korean OEM did not mention it. However, it seems that was far from an exhaustive list, as I reckoned. Sammyfans noticed that Samsung's Singapore newsroom updated its list with additional devices (though that region has a different rollout date). Image Credit: Peter Holden/TalkAndroid Besides the exact rollout dates being bound to differ depending on the region you're in, there's no reason not to expect the same devices to be eligible across the world. Here they are: Samsung Galaxy S24 Family (including S24 FE) Samsung Galaxy S23 Family (including S23 FE) Samsung Galaxy S22 Family Samsung Galaxy S21 Family (including S21 FE) Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Newer Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Newer Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Series Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Series Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE Series Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Series Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite Where Are the Midrangers Getting One UI 7? Even though the list has gotten a lot larger, if you have a keen eye, you'll know that it is certainly isn't exhaustive at this point either. While the list has all the flagship devices that will be receiving the update, it completely neglects the midrangers and even budget smartphones that have every right to be in line. Image: Samsung At the very least, we know that the Galaxy A53, A54, and Galaxy A55 should be eligible for One UI 7, in addition to the A33, A34, and A35. There are also some budget devices that are expected to be included in the rollout, though those will likely be at the tail end and may drop a lot of the AI features that the higher-end models get to have. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
