  "text": "The launch of the first-generation Nothing Phone (1) from a couple years back was undoubtedly one of the most highly-anticipated smartphone releases in recent years, and the company is looking to recapture the same level of hype and excitement with the arrival of the Nothing Phone (3), the latest flagship handset from the brand. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Review (SAVE $400!) With that said though, nothing wasn’t content in unveiling just a single product today—enter the Nothing Headphones (1), which go beyond the brand’s many wireless earbuds in terms of both sound and functionality. Let’s check them out! While there’s been no shortage of Nothing Phone models over the past few years, the Phone (3) marks a return to flagship-tier hardware for Nothing. Up front it is a 6.67-inch AMOLED display with super-slim bezels all around, wrapped inside a design that somewhat looks familiar when compared to older Nothing devices. The Phone (3) ditches the Glyph Interface lighting setup, in lieu of a simple and more straightforward Glyph Matrix display, which still serves as a notification hub of sorts. It also functions as a display for your battery level, clock, stopwatch, and a mirror of sorts. Also present is the Essential Key, an additional action button that can be mapped for specific functions. As for cameras, the Phone (3) features an interesting setup with an asymmetrical lens layout , led by a 1/1.3-inch main sensor. Video recording maxes out at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second throughout all lenses, with support for optical image stabilization as well. This entire setup is powered by a Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 chipset, alongside a 5150 mAh silicon-carbon battery, with support for 65W fast-charging. Nothing Headphones (1) Also at the event were the Nothing Headphones (1), the brand’s first-ever over-ear wireless headphones. The new headphones come with Nothing’s signature look with a semi-transparent design—interestingly enough, Nothing has gone for a squared-off look that might be a bit divisive for some fans, but it nevertheless retains the brand’s overall visual identity. The Headphones (1) were developed in collaboration with audio veteran KEF, and feature custom-built 40mm dynamic drivers alongside support for on-device spatialization, head tracking, Hi-Res Audio support, LDAC, USB-C lossless playback, and connectivity via a 3.5mm jack as well. You’re also getting active noise cancellation, in addition to around 35 hours of playback with ANC, and quick switching between audio apps. As for price, the Nothing Phone (3) starts at $799 for the 256GB storage variant, while the Headphones (1) start at $299.",
