Oftentimes, the most interesting conversations seem to happen when your signal is at its worst. What could’ve been a great moment turns into a struggle just to stay connected. If you're tired of that happening, AT\u0026T may have the solution you need. The mobile carrier is offering a new program called Try AT\u0026T that lets new postpaid and prepaid customers experience their wireless service for free for 30 days. They’re giving you a chance to test out their 5G network and see the performance firsthand before making any commitments. If you're interested, here's more information. Enjoy uninterrupted 5G connectivity on iOS Try AT\u0026T is a newly introduced service that allows you to experience AT\u0026T’s wireless network for free for 30 days. That is, if you're a new user. With the trial offer, you’ll test the network without any commitments or credit card requirements. You just need to download the myAT\u0026T app or visit the program's information webpage to get started. Image: AT\u0026T Once you begin the trial, you’ll enjoy unlimited talk and text, along with 100GB of data for all your browsing and streaming needs. You’ll also receive 25GB of personal hotspot data, which lets you connect your phone, tablets, and even laptops to AT\u0026T’s 5G network.  Also, you can send unlimited texts from the USA to over 230 countries. However, the trial is currently limited to iOS users with eSIM-compatibility. If you're an Android user, you'll wait until 2025. AT\u0026T doesn't say when exactly, but we're only two months away from the new year.  Zero commitment \u0026 no credit cards required Throughout the 30 days trial for Try AT\u0026T, you have the flexibility to switch to a different plan or stop your trial at any time, all without any penalties. If you find that it doesn’t work for you, you can easily move on. When your plan ends, it ends for good and doesn't automatically renew. Even if you decide to continue using the service before the 30 days are up, you have the option to switch to a paid plan at any time during your trial. Image: AT\u0026T You can keep your current phone number and transfer it to AT\u0026T, or you can opt for a new number. If you choose the former, you'll receive a temporary eSIM on your device to create a temporary AT\u0026T Wireless account.  When the trial ends, you can delete the eSIM from your device settings if you choose not to continue with their service. Overall, the program aims to give you the opportunity to see how the company's services can work for you before making a long-term commitment.  Try AT\u0026T eligibility While AT\u0026T’s new program sounds rosy, there are some eligibility requirements. You do not qualify for the trial under the following conditions: Your phone model doesn’t support eSIM. Your phone is locked by your current provider. You live outside the United States. Your device is signed out of your Apple ID.  Image: Apple As aforementioned, only iOS users can enjoy the trial program. Although the carrier says that it's compatible with iPhone XR, only iPhone 12 or newer models support the 5G network. So, even though you can join the program, your experience will be slower than users with newer models. Irene is an experienced writer with four years in the Tech, E-commerce, and Food niches.
