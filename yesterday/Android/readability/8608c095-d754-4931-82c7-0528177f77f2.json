  "text": "Summary Google's planned transition from Google Assistant to Gemini is now visibly beginning on Wear OS smartwatches, following recent confirmations of Gemini's expansion to wearables. Specific changes observed include a Gemini splash screen when triggering the assistant and a Gemini icon in recent apps, linked to Assistant app version 1.18.x, which also introduces a \"Digital assistant\" name in settings. Despite these visual and naming hints, the underlying AI currently remains Google Assistant, suggesting the changes are initial preparations for the full Gemini integration expected soon. Google's long-term assistant strategy is clear as day — Gemini will replace the long-standing Google Assistant on all surfaces. The tech giant openly communicated the transition plan earlier in March this year, and we're already starting to see the deprecation starting to kick-in on Android Auto and Automotive, Fitbit wearables, Google Maps, and more. Earlier this week, Google CEO Sundar Pichai reiterated that Gemini is coming for tablets, headphones, and even your wearables. Now, we're now starting to see the first clues that point to the AI assistant arriving on the latter. Related For reference, when you trigger Google Assistant, your watch first displays a splash screen while the assistant loads in the background. Once ready to be used, the familiar \"Hi, how can I help\" Google Assistant screen pops up. Up until recently, the splash screen, of course, surfaced in the familiar visual style of Google Assistant. Though that is no longer the case. Highlighted by an Android Police reader and tipster (thanks Eduardo), triggering Google Assistant on their Galaxy Watch 4 now surfaces the Blue Gemini logo splash screen. I tried to replicate the tip on my OnePlus Watch 2, and lo and behold, my watch is showing me the Gemini logo too. The screenshot on the left is what I'm seeing on the splash screen, and the screenshot on the right is the familiar Google Assistant UI that pops up after the splash screen. We're also seeing the Gemini logo in the recent apps menu, but in the app drawer, it retains its regular blue, red, yellow, and green Google Assistant look. Still Google Assistant inside The appearance of Gemini assets coincides with version 1.18.175.746241784 of the Assistant (Wear OS) app, which also renames the app to Digital assistant, and automatically sets it as the default assistant app. Additionally, 'Google Assistant' isn't present in the list of default assistants to choose from. It's likely that 'Digital assistant' is just a placeholder, and it will eventually be updated to read Gemini. Older builds, like version 1.16.x, still highlight Google Assistant as the app's name, with no change to its splash screen or 'recents' logo. Currently, Google Assistant remains the underlying tech-powering interactions on the watch. Google is likely updating said UI elements in preparation for the full transition, which will likely come soon, judging by how things are going. Thanks: Eduardo Related",
