The Four Seasons has taken Netflix by storm this May, captivating audiences with its perfect 10/10 rating. This brilliant comedy series, inspired by a 1980s cult classic, has quickly climbed to the top of Netflix's most-watched list. Comedy lovers are already clamoring for a second season of this refreshingly witty show created by comedy powerhouse Tina Fey. Netflix has struck gold with their latest comedy offering that premiered on May 1st, 2025. In just a matter of days, The Four Seasons has emerged as the platform's standout success, earning perfect ratings and drawing viewers in with its smart writing and stellar cast. This reimagining of a beloved 80s film has resonated with audiences seeking quality comedy amidst the sea of dramas and thrillers dominating streaming platforms today. Comedy dream team behind Netflix's newest hit The Four Seasons brings together an exceptional ensemble of talent both behind and in front of the camera. At the helm is comedy veteran Tina Fey, who serves as creator, writer, and lead actress. Her previous successes with 30 Rock and Mean Girls have established her reputation for crafting intelligent, character-driven comedy. Joining Fey is a remarkable cast including Steve Carell of The Office fame and the versatile Colman Domingo. This powerhouse trio delivers performances that critics are calling “perfectly balanced” and “genuinely hilarious.” Their chemistry elevates the show's already sharp dialogue to new heights. What sets this series apart is how it tackles relationship complexities with both humor and heart. Unlike many contemporary comedies that rely on shock value, The Four Seasons employs: Sophisticated character development Witty, authentic dialogue Relatable relationship dynamics Thoughtful exploration of adult friendships The production quality matches the writing excellence, with beautiful cinematography capturing the seasonal settings and a soundtrack that complements the emotional undertones of each episode perfectly. Fresh take on relationships earning perfect scores The premise of The Four Seasons follows three married couples who vacation together every season in New York.

What unfolds is a thoughtful examination of modern relationships that avoids clichés while maintaining genuine humor. Critics have praised the series for its refreshing approach to adult friendships and romantic partnerships.
