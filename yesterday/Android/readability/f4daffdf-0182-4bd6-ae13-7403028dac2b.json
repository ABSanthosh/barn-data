The Camera app will become much cleaner with fewer distractions around the viewfinder but also integrate some of the settings that are currently available outside the app, like resolution and frame rate control during video recording.

The Camera app will become much cleaner with fewer distractions around the viewfinder but also integrate some of the settings that are currently available outside the app, like resolution and frame rate control during video recording. That's something Android got right from the very beginning and it will finally happen in iOS 19. The video doesn't show the actual redesign because fpt. doesn't want to expose its sources within Apple. Instead, the video shows a close representation of the future Camera app. Everything is centered around the viewfinder with minimal distractions. All the settings and camera modes are more condensed, animations are more fluid, so you have to swipe to access them. Potential iOS 19 Camera app redesign In a way, it looks very similar to some Android camera apps, especially the part where you can now change the resolution and frame rate within the camera app instead of going into the general Settings menu. But the leak suggests there's more to it than just a redesign. The whole aesthetic of the camera app and the way you can interact with the UI is reminiscent of visionOS, which means that a full, system-wide redesign awaits us in iOS 19. That doesn't sound too far-fetched given that the last major iOS redesign came with version 7. On the other hand, we might witness a gradual shift toward visionOS aesthetics by starting with subtle redesigns of some core iOS apps before spilling out into the system itself. After all, it's a bit too early to be certain, so we can only speculate, because iOS 19 is at least 9 months away for the regular user, so a lot can change in that time.",
