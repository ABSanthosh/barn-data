However, a confirmation that the company is working on the chipset comes from an unlikely place - Samsung's earnings report.

The report says the Korean tech giant is working on refining the flagship SoC and wants to \"secure design wins for mobile models scheduled for release in H2 2025\". And what comes in the second half of 2025? The foldables, of course. This is a hint that Samsung wants to release its upcoming Galaxy Z Fold7 and Z Flip7 phones with Exynos 2500 on board. Still, we don't know whether all versions of these phones will run on the Exynos or if some markets will get the Snapdragon 8 Elite from Qualcomm, as Samsung usually does. There will be Exynos 2500-powered units, though, that's almost a guarantee at this point. The chipset's specs have been featured in a couple of leaks so far, but the latest one is from a few days ago, showing a change in the CPU clusters with a 1+2+2+5 configuration, instead of 1+2+3+4 used in the Exynos 2400.
