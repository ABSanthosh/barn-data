Related Satechi Stand \u0026 Hub for Mac review: The perfect companion for Mac mini or Mac Studio If you're looking for a way to add expandable storage to your Mac mini or Mac Studio, this is the cleanest way to do it. So good, in fact, that if you didn't know, you'd swear that this was made by Apple. We loved this accessory in our review, giving it a very solid 9 out of 10, which is a monster score. And at its newly discounted price during Amazon's Big Spring Sale, it's an absolute must-buy for any Mac Mini or Mac Studio owner. What's great about the Satechi Stand \u0026 Hub? Satechi has been around for some time, making some great accessories that are both sleek and reliable. The Stand \u0026 Hub is made for the Mac Mini and Mac Studio with an M1 or M2 chip. This particular accessory will not work with the latest Mac Mini M4. But if you're looking for that model, Satechi has one out right now that we also really loved. When it comes to port expansion, you're looking at a wide variety, all of them sitting at the front, making it easier to connect any accessories. There are SD and microSD card slots, a 3.5mm audio jack, three USB-A ports, and one USB-C port. On the inside of the device, there's a single M.2 SSD slot that can be used to expand your Mac's storage.
