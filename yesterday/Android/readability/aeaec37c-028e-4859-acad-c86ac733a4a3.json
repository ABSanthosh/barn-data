That isn't a road often traveled by the brand, and the same can be said for the design of the camera island. It definitely doesn't scream OnePlus, from a distance it actually looks most similar to what Google did for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. There are also some traces of the Xiaomi Mi 11 in it. It's definitely interesting to see OnePlus switch things up design-wise, but at this point we're not sure if this is the new design language that we should expect from its future devices, or just a one-off for the upcoming smaller flagship. The OnePlus 13T has a 6.31-inch LTPO OLED screen with \"1.5K\" resolution and 120 Hz refresh rate, the Snapdragon 8 Elite at the helm, a 50 MP main camera, a 50 MP telephoto with 2x optical zoom, a 6,200 mAh battery with 80W wired charging support, and it will be the first OnePlus phone to ditch the Alert Slider for a programmable button, according to past rumors.",
