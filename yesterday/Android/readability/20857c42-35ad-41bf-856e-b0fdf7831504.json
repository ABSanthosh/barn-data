  "text": "Realme fans are in for a treat—the brand has finally launched its new GT 7 and GT 7T phones, which are priced to compete with other midrange devices such as the Galaxy S24 FE and iPhone 16e, for example. READ: Google’s Partnership with TSMC will Last for Several Pixel Generations, Reports Claim The Realme GT 7 packs a Dimensity 9400e chipset with up to 16GB RAM/512GB storage, and a 6.8-inch FHD+ AMOLED 120Hz display. Performance is further handled by Realme’s IceSence cooling technology for better thermal management. For software, the phone runs Realme UI 6.0 based on Android 15, with up to four years of OS updates and six years of security patches. For cameras, the GT 7 packs a 50MP telephoto lens (2x optical zoom), a 50MP (IMX 906) main camera with OIS, an 8MP ultrawide lens, and a 32MP front camera. Powering the device is a 7,000 mAh silicon-carbon battery with 120W wired fast charging. Meanwhile, the more affordable GT 7T features a 6.8-inch FHD+ 120Hz AMOLED display with 1,800 nits peak brightness. It’s powered by a custom Dimensity 8400-Max chipset, with up to 12GB RAM/512GB storage; there’s also a dual-camera system includes a 50MP (IMX896) main sensor and an 8MP ultrawide lens, plus a 32MP selfie camera. Like the GT 7, it runs Realme UI 6.0 based on Android 15 with the same update commitment, IP69 dust and water resistance, a 7,000 mAh battery, and 120W charging. The GT 7 and 7T are priced starting at 750 and 650 EUR, respectively.",
