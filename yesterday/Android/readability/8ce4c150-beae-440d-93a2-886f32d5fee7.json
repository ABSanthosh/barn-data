Samsung says the Now Bar is a \"defining element\" of One UI 7. This is basically the Korean company's own interpretation of the Dynamic Island concept. In Samsung's own words, the Now Bar \"gives personalization a new meaning by seamlessly integrating your everyday actions and most-used apps into your lock screen\". As you can see from the image above, the Now Bar resides at the bottom center of your lock screen, and lets you \"control your entertainment, time your next personal best workout, get directions to your next meeting, or start communicating in other languages\". The Now Bar will also \"be an access point for the most comprehensively insightful experiences ever\" on Galaxy devices. If you're packing for a trip, for example, it will prompt you to create a folder of your essential apps for quick access. It will also let you know when it's time to leave for the airport, something Google has been doing successfully for many, many years on Android devices left and right, but hey - this is Samsung's take on the same feature. The Now Bar will even provide a \"curated travel playlist to set the mood\" for your flight, though it's unclear in what music app it will do that. You can access the weather forecast with a single swipe, and at the end of each day the Now Bar will help you \"relive the highlights\". Now Bar aside, Samsung has also detailed its Personal Data Engine, \"a powerful privacy advancement that ensures on-device, cross-app personal data protection\". The data is stored in a secure space, safeguarded by an encryption key managed by Knox Vault, the same trusted platform that secures your biometric data. There's an added layer of protection with post-quantum cryptography as well. Source",
