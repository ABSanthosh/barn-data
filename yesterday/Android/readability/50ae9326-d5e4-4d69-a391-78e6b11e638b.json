  "text": "Not too long ago, MediaTek recently took the wraps off its latest addition to its Dimensity chip range in the form of the Dimensity 8300, a chipset designed for upper midrange devices. The company more recently revealed a follow-up with the Dimensity 8350, which makes its debut in several new devices from Oppo, which include the Reno 13 series and Oppo Pad 3. Built on a 4nm process, the Dimensity 8350 is a minor step-up of sorts from the 8300, and is equipped with an eight-core processor that runs on 3.35GHz Cortex-A715 prime cores. One key addition found on the 8350 is the “StarSpeed Engine,” which takes over the somewhat “older” HyperEngine for gaming tasks. MediaTek claims that the StarSpeed Engine results in 10% less power consumption and better frame-rate consistency during gaming. In addition to four Cortex-A715 cores and four Cortex-A510 cores, the 8350 also packs a Mali-G615 MC6 GPU, support for high-speed LPDDR5X RAM (up to 8533Mbps) and UFS 4.0 storage. AI tasks are handled by MediaTek’s NPU 780, and there’s support for up to a single 320MP camera sensor, up to 180Hz FHD+ displays, Bluetooth 5.4, and WiFi 6E. Source: MediaTek (CN)",
