We will start with the Google Pixel 9 Pro as this one has the best discount. It’s not automatic, you have to use the code listed below (but it’s also listed on the Amazon page, so it’s easy to copy and paste). The Pixel 9 Pro is on the small side as far as Android flagships go, but has a high-res LTPO display, a 50+48+48MP camera (including a 5x 113mm periscope), satellite SOS and will receive 7 years of support. You can go larger with the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL – with a 6.8” display and 221g of weight, it’s a hefty device. On the plus side, it has a large 5,060mAh battery with 37W wired and 23W wireless charging, which is faster than any Pixel before it. Even with a large discount, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is still quite pricey. However, this is a tablet in your pocket with an 8” inner display (120Hz LTPO) and a manageable 6.3” 20:9 cover display to use when folded. The cameras aren’t as good as the other 9 Pro models with a 48MP main (small 1/2.0” sensor), 10.8MP 5x 112mm periscope and 10.5MP 127° ultra wide. The Google Pixel 9 is the exact same size as the 9 Pro and has the same Tensor G4 chipset. However, the 6.3” display isn’t an LTPO panel and you lose the 5x periscope (but you keep the 50MP 1/1.31” main and 48MP 123° ultra wide cameras). The 42MP selfie camera of the Pro is also replaced by a basic 10.5MP selfie cam. Right now, the price difference is so small that getting the Pixel 9 Pro over the vanilla 9 is a no-brainer. If it’s cheap that you want, the Google Pixel 8a is cheaper (if not necessarily cheap). It’s on the small side too with a 6.1” display. While it’s short on processing power with the old Tensor G3 chip, it will receive 7 years of support, just like its pricier siblings. It is equipped with a 64MP main camera (1/1.73”) and a 13MP ultra wide (120°). The 4,492mAh battery supports both wired (18W) and wireless charging (7.5W), both of them slow. Note that the Pixel 8a doesn’t come with $200 off the Pixel Watch 3 or 50% off the Pixel Buds Pro 2 – that offer is for Pixel 9 phones only. For completeness’ sake, here is how much the watch and buds cost without the special discount. Moving on, Samsung still sells tablets with IPS LCD screens in the form of the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and Tab S9 FE+ slates. The former is a 10.9” tablet, the latter a 12.4” model, both with 90Hz panels and both powered by the Exynos 1380 chipset. They support DeX multitasking on their own screen, but there’s no video out. Samsung has smartwatches too and the Galaxy Watch Ultra is more adventurous than its Pixel sibling. It is rated 100m for diving and has a large 590mAh battery plus an efficient 3nm chipset, so that it can go longer between charges. Both watches have ECG. We may get a commission from qualifying sales.",
