  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Despite a lot of backlash about rising prices and other small issues, T-Mobile's future looks bright. The wireless carrier just announced its best quarter yet by adding 1.3 million paid subscribers, crushing competitor Verizon, which saw a record loss. Related Not only that, but during its Q1 earnings call, CEO Mike Seivert went a little more in-depth about its upcoming satellite service that's currently in beta. Sievert shared on the call that it would be called T-Satellite and that it would be priced at $10 per month. A new way to communicate The service has amassed quite a number of users during its short trial period, with hundreds of thousands of users giving it a try. And it's easy to understand why. Being able to communicate in places that previously didn't have service is a huge leap. Not only is this crucial when you're in an emergency situation, but it also makes it possible for those in remote areas to stay connected as well. The big news today was that when the service goes live, and as mentioned before, that it will be available for just $10 per month. It's important to note that T-Mobile customers with the Go5G Next and Experience Beyond plans will get satellite service access for free. Perhaps the icing on the cake here is that this pricing will also be extended to AT\u0026T and Verizon customers as well. Sievert stated that the rate will be good for at least a year, and that commercial service will make its debut in July, but didn't deliver any word on pricing. You can watch the details in the video above, starting at the 7-minute and 30-second mark. Currently, T-Mobile has over 550 satellites in orbit to make this service work, and was able to achieve this with the help of SpaceX. Now, T-Mobile isn't the only one working on satellite service for its customers, with both Verizon and AT\u0026T also offering similar services. It will be interesting to see how this space takes off in the years to come.",

Sievert shared on the call that it would be called T-Satellite and that it would be priced at $10 per month.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"a-new-way-to-communicate\"\u003e\n                        A new way to communicate\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe service has amassed quite a number of users during its short trial period, with hundreds of thousands of users giving it a try. And it\u0026#39;s easy to understand why. Being able to communicate in places that previously didn\u0026#39;t have service is a huge leap.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eNot only is this crucial when you\u0026#39;re in an emergency situation, but it also makes it possible for those in remote areas to stay connected as well. The big news today was that when the service goes live, and as mentioned before, that it will be available for just $10 per month. It\u0026#39;s important to note that T-Mobile customers with the Go5G Next and Experience Beyond plans will get satellite service access for free.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the icing on the cake here is that this pricing will also be extended to AT\u0026amp;T and Verizon customers as well. Sievert stated that the rate will be good for at least a year, and that commercial service will make its debut in July, but didn\u0026#39;t deliver any word on pricing. You can watch the details in the video above, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXVrYVEDOIg\u0026amp;t=454s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estarting at the 7-minute and 30-second mark\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, T-Mobile has over 550 satellites in orbit to make this service work, and was able to achieve this with the help of SpaceX. Now, T-Mobile isn\u0026#39;t the only one working on satellite service for its customers, with both Verizon and AT\u0026amp;T also offering similar services. It will be interesting to see how this space takes off in the years to come. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                            \n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
