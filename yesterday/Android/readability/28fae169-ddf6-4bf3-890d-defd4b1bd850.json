More specifically, the collaboration will bring Mistral AI’s Ministral 3B and Ministral 8B AI models for on-device usage. Due to their relatively compact sizes, the 3B and 8B are ideal for use with hardware including vehicular infotainment systems, smartphones, and even computers. They’re also power-efficient, and feature enhanced privacy capabilities. Durga Malladi, Senior VP GM for technology, planning and edge solutions at Qualcomm states: We are thrilled to announce our collaboration with Mistral AI to help achieve our goal of empowering devices at the edge with the latest advancements in AI technology… Mistral AI’s Ministral 3B and Ministral 8B will enable device manufacturers, software vendors, and digital service providers to deliver innovative experiences, such as AI assistants and other applications that understand users’ wants and needs, thanks to the immediacy, reliability, and enhanced privacy of on-device AI.
