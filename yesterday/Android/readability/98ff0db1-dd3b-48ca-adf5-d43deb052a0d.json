  "text": "Alienware Pro Wireless Gaming Headset $180 $230 Save $50 We loved these headphones when we reviewed them, delivering good sound quality and ANC. They were also extremely comfortable, wireless, and were also packed with an abundance of great features. Right now, you can score these headphones at their best price as they drop to $180. There are a lot of things to look for if you're shopping for a new gaming headset. Perhaps the thing that comes to mind first for most is going to be sound quality, but we think comfort is more important, because if you can't wear them for an extended period, they aren't going to be worth buying. Related Alienware Pro Wireless Gaming Headset review: The only headset you need? Alienware wants this headset to be your go-to audio device for gaming and more, but that might be a tough sell On top of good sound, you're also going to need a clear microphone, along with excellent compatibility. With that said, we think this Alienware Pro Wireless Gaming Heaset checks most of those boxes, providing an excellent experience, while also being on sale. For a limited time, you can save 22% off the retail price of $230, bringing it down to its lowest at $180. What's great about the Alienware Pro Wireless Gaming Headset? As you can see, this Alienware wireless gaming headset features a simple design and comes in two colors: black and white. Despite its appearance, the headset is packed with features, and also offers great sound quality as well. You get comfortable memory foam padding on the ears, and a headband that attempts to relieve pressure so you can make it through long gaming sessions. You get an abundance of physical controls that are located on both earcups, making it easy to make adjustments on the fly. Plus there's even a removable microphone, just in case you don't need the accessory at all. With that said, the microphone is pretty solid, providing excellent voice clarity and noise-cancelling features. There's even ANC to help you stay focused, even if your surroundings are a little distracting. The best part is you get versatile connectivity with Bluetooth, 2.4Ghz wireless, and USB. And battery life is also quite good, with the headset providing up to 75 hours of use on a single charge. There's even quick charging that will get you eight hours of use with a 15-minute charge. Overall, this is a fantastic pair of headphones that really offers a lot of features. And while we thought they were great at retail price, it became an absolute no-brainer with its newly discounted price of $180. Just be sure to grab them quickly because this steep discount won't be around for long.",

going to need a clear microphone, along with excellent compatibility. With that said, we think this Alienware Pro Wireless Gaming Heaset checks most of those boxes, providing an excellent experience, while also being on sale. For a limited time, you can save 22% off the retail price of $230, bringing it down to its lowest at $180. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"what-39-s-great-about-the-alienware-pro-wireless-gaming-headset\"\u003e\n                        What\u0026#39;s great about the Alienware Pro Wireless Gaming Headset?\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, this Alienware wireless gaming headset features a simple design and comes in two colors: black and white. Despite its appearance, the headset is packed with features, and also offers great sound quality as well. You get comfortable memory foam padding on the ears, and a headband that attempts to relieve pressure so you can make it through long gaming sessions. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eYou get an abundance of physical controls that are located on both earcups, making it easy to make adjustments on the fly. Plus there\u0026#39;s even a removable microphone, just in case you don\u0026#39;t need the accessory at all. With that said, the microphone is pretty solid, providing excellent voice clarity and noise-cancelling features. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s even ANC to help you stay focused, even if your surroundings are a little distracting. The best part is you get versatile connectivity with Bluetooth, 2.4Ghz wireless, and USB. And battery life is also quite good, with the headset providing up to 75 hours of use on a single charge. There\u0026#39;s even quick charging that will get you eight hours of use with a 15-minute charge. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOverall, this is a fantastic pair of headphones that really offers a lot of features. And while we thought they were great at retail price, it became an absolute no-brainer with its newly discounted price of $180. Just be sure to grab them quickly because this steep discount won\u0026#39;t be around for long. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                            \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
