We say seemingly because while an Italian retailer purportedly uploaded its listings for the trio too soon (and has since taken them down), the prices themselves look odd. Purported Galaxy S25 pricing Let's take a look. The S25 is allegedly €973 with 128GB of storage, €1,036 with 256GB of storage, and €1,162 with 512GB.

Let's just say it outright: the Galaxy S25 will definitely not have these numbers as recommended retail prices. Those end in 49 or 99. So it's either €949 or €999 for the base version, and so on. Purported Galaxy S25+ pricingWe don't know if this retailer just wanted a bit of online exposure by uploading opportunistic prices or what's going on, but anyway, let's continue with the S25+. With 256GB of storage, €1,246. With 512GB, €1,371. And finally, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is allegedly coming in at a whopping €1,571 with 256GB, €1,696 with 512GB, and €1,948 with 1TB of storage. Purported Galaxy S25 Ultra pricingIf we round all of these prices up to the nearest hundred euros, then it seems like Europe is in for a €100 price hike across the board. Then again, these prices might just be an Italian's imagination at work. There's no telling at this point. If you're wondering why the Galaxy S25 Slim isn't covered, that actually makes sense since it's rumored to be releasing a few months after the other three. Via",
