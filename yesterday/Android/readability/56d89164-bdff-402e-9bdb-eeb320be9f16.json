With that said, it's important to have a versatile robot vacuum that can clean hard and soft surfaces. Now, there are a ton of different robot vacuums on the market today, but Ecovacs is really pushing the upper limit of what's possible, while also offering a range of devices for nearly every budget. So if you've been looking to buy a robot vacuum, we have some great ones to recommend this Prime Day, with Evocavs knocking up to $500 off some of its best models, like the DEEBOT T50 Pro Omni and DEEBOT T30S. Both models feature a mop and vacuum function, and are very good at what they do. There's also an included base station that can handle maintenance, making them easier to use. Ecovas DEEBOT T50 Pro Omni Source:Â Ecovacs An elegant and powerful robot vacuum that doesn't skimp on features or functions. You get a sleek design with a vacuum that can handle pretty much anything you can throw at it. It features an impressive 15,000Pa of suction power, and the ability to reach every corner and crevice. In addition to its powerful vacuum, the T50 Pro Omni can also handle mopping duties as well. And when things get tough, the robot vacuum can also roll up its sleeves to deliver impressive cleaning power over hard surfaces with precision scrubbing. There's even a base state that can collect the debris from the bin, clean the mop brush with hot water, dry the brush with hot air, and refill the water. Ecovas DEEBOT T50 Pro Omni $600 $800 Save $200 An impressive robot vacuum that can handle double duty as a vacuum and mop. The best part is that it also has a base station that can take care of most of the maintenance. Furthermore, it doesn't cost all that much right now, thanks to this Prime Day deal that knocks $200 off. Ecovas DEEBOT T30S Another great option if you're looking for a robot vacuum that can do pretty much all you need it to. You get a sleek design and impressive base station that takes all the work out of the maintenance portion. While this robot vacuum isn't as slim as the T50 Pro Omni, it still packs tons of great features, with the ability to deliver impressive results with its vacuum and mopping. You get 11,000Pa of suction power here, bristles that won't get tangled up, and edge-to-edge cleaning. Mopping is also going to be quite good here, with the power of AI picking up spots that need a little extra work. The base station will also take care of all the maintenance, like washing the mop heads with hot water, hot air drying and collecting dry debris. Ecovas DEEBOT T30S $500 $1000 Save $500 A powerful and elegant robot vacuum that not only vacuums, but it can also mop as well. You also get a base station that can handle all the maintenance that you don't want to do, like cleaning the mop head, emptying the vacuum, and more. Score this fantastic vacuum for less as it drops to an impressive price for Prime Day. Overall, these are some impressive units. You get something a little different with each model, but both are extremely capable when it comes to vacuuming and mopping. That means that, regardless of which one you choose, you're going to be getting an excellent cleaning experience. Just be sure to pick these up during Amazon's Prime Day sales event because these prices won't be around for long.",
