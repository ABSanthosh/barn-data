Excitement continues building as CES 2025 prepares to showcase the latest trends in technology from January 7 to January 10. So far, we've seen AI glasses, a toothbrush that cleans your teeth in 20 seconds, and even intelligent bassinets to help babies sleep. Keyboards and headphones may not seem as impressive in this grand picture, but they still play a big role in our frequent work and entertainment lifestyles. JLab continues to see this need and has released product bundles to help you save and have a great time doing what you do. Related: Here’s All The Tech You Can Expect To See At CES 2025 Work comfortably with JLab’s ergonomic bundle Now, with the looming changes to taxes under Trump's administration, it's a great time to lock into that gadget you've had your eye on. As tariffs and taxes may impact product prices, buying what you need now can help you get ahead of any price hikes that could follow. In JLab’s offerings, “ergonomic” and “audiophile” are the keywords. In home setups, you want to stay comfortable and healthy while you're spending those long hours at a desk. The brand has released the JBuds Flow Wireless Keyboard and Mouse bundle, which you can customize to work exactly how you want using the JLab Work App.  Image: Lab The keyboard is curved in shape to promote a more natural typing posture, recognizing that not everyone sits perfectly straight when typing. The product is meant to adapt to your body’s movements, allowing your wrists and hands to rest in a more comfortable, neutral position, even if you tend to slouch or lean forward. The keys pop out clearly, so that it's easy to find and press them. The mouse also mirrors this contoured design, and both will sell for £59.99 (≈$75) on the official website.

The first one is the Go Lux ANC Wireless On-Ear Headphones bring Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) to block out distractions, plus a “Be Aware” mode to let some outside noise in when needed. Image: Lab The fit is a comfortable one, courtesy of the Cloud Foam earpads and headband that you can also customize with the JLab app. The price is £49.99 (≈$63), and they’ll be available for order from January 6th. Although the Go Pop ANC True Wireless Earbuds already entered the market in black, fuchsia, and teal, JLab says that they've added new transparent colors, blue, green, and purple. These models will be available for pre-order in Spring 2025, priced at £34.99 ($44). Image: JLab Also arriving in Spring is the third audio device, the Epic Lux Lab Edition Wireless Headphone. This premium headphones comes with ANC, up to 90 hours of playtime, four microphones, and Bluetooth Multipoint. It'll cost £199.99 (≈$251).
