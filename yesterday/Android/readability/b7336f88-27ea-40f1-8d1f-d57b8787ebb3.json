  "text": "As part of an ongoing team-up coinciding with the Galaxy S25 series’ launch, Samsung recently announced that it’s worked with Google to bring a new “Galaxy Watch for Kids” experience, which will be exclusive for Galaxy Watch 7 LTE models (at least for now). The feature works with Wear OS and integrates other Google features such as Google Family Link, which will allow parents to set up additional security features for their kid’s smartwatch. Parents can pair their child’s Galaxy Watch to their own smartphone and activate the watch’s eSIM, and access several features for monitoring and communication. These include location sharing, as well as contact management that allows parent accounts to limit who their kids can contact and vice-versa. There’s also a built-in SOS feature that can be activated via pressing the side button five times, as well as a built-in “school time” mode that limits distractions during learning hours. For personalization, there’s a selection of several kid-friendly watch faces and apps on Google Play, as well as kids bands designed for the Watch 7. The feature rolls out beginning today for users in the United States, with availability through Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT\u0026T.",
