  "text": "4 of the best prebuilt NAS operating systems on turnkey systems OS Sign in to your XDA account Picking one of many turnkey Network-Attached Storage (NAS) servers can prove daunting, especially considering the operating system (OS). Each branded enclosure has a proprietary OS, but which is best for your storage needs? That's where this list of the best prebuilt NAS OS comes into play, ranking all the top software. Each of these NAS operating systems is available free with their respective servers. Related Best NAS devices in 2025 Expand your PC storage with one of these NAS enclosures 4 TerraMaster TOS Great if a little rough TerraMaster may be the last OS on our list, but it's not necessarily the worst. Although slightly dated, this OS is just as good as many of the others, running atop the brand's NAS servers. These devices are usually priced aggressively to take on Synology with better specifications and you could think of its TerraMaster OS (TOS) as a similar affair on the software side. It won't win design awards but TOS gets the job done. TerraMaster has worked hard in recent years to polish TOS and bring it up to the same standard as the competition. While there are still some ways to go, the company has made strides to get where it is today. You'll likely only find some minor issues with design element inconsistencies, slight mistranslations with newer features, and a lack of first-party apps, though full Docker container support is present. TOS is the OS to go with if you prefer a barebones experience with very little bloat to get in your way of creating your dream NAS. 3 QNAP QTS User-friendly yet capable QNAP focuses on getting you to your destination when using their web interface. The underlying OS is rock solid and the company is known for its robust hardware and software offerings. QTS is a great OS and one you can safely rely on for all your storage needs with many of the basic features, as well as some more advanced stuff for power users. Like other turnkey NAS OS, QTS has a plethora of apps available. Want to configure some SSDs for caching? No problem. Want to set up SSL for more secure links to your NAS? That's doable! QNAP even sells optional AI compute hardware to improve the performance of your QNAP NAS with a better Neural Processing Unit (NPU) and higher TOPs for image search, home security, and more. The company is responsible for creating some of the most powerful prebuilt NAS devices around. 2 Asustor ADM Powerful and fun to use Asustor has been around for some time but it remains a small player in the NAS game. Its software offering is one of the most robust platforms for storing lots of data, however, especially when compared to other turnkey NAS OS. You've got a comprehensive app store with plenty of popular choices, and full Docker support is present should you wish to go it alone or need something more obscure. Instead of a desktop-like experience that other OS user interfaces (UI) offer, Asustor kept to the mobile look with big app icons on the main screen for quick and convenient access. This is a web view designed to get you where you need to be without much work. But if you do want to dive deep into your NAS settings and configure almost anything about the enclosure, that's also possible. There are some major features here too, including a powerful search system with the ability to preview media files, easy web server deployment, and enhancements to Btrfs. 1 Synology DSM Best for beginners Synology is one of the leading prebuilt NAS brands for a reason. Its hardware has always been cutting edge and the software support has been second to none. The latest version of DiskStation Manager (DSM) is excellent and so too are the enclosures it supports. While some may find Synology's more recent NAS underwhelming compared to previous-gen models, its NAS OS is still rated as among the best in the business. Designed from the ground up to be as easy to learn as possible, DSM is often recommended to beginners. You can run just about anything on a DSM-powered NAS, including Docker containers. Set up a web server, media streaming service, home surveillance system, and much more with nothing but a Synology NAS. It may be a proprietary system with a closed ecosystem, but Synology is the Apple of the NAS world. With its impressive cloud service support, Synology is now much more than a simple NAS vendor. The company is a cloud platform provider with the means to power not only your local backup storage but also collaborative needs across multiple geo-locations. Synology is the better choice for a more refined experience with some of the best options around. You can't make a wrong choice Your choice of operating system largely depends on the platform you intend to use. If it's a turnkey solution, this will depend entirely on which brand you go with. Thankfully, most of these operating systems are excellent and worth using. Whether you're rocking a Synology DiskStation DS224+ or Asustor AS5402T, you'll have a great time setting everything up, running software, and storing all your data. Interestingly, you're usually locked down with your brand's OS, though some do allow sideloading, including specific TerraMaster NAS. Related Building your own NAS?

Although slightly dated, this OS is just as good as many of the others, running atop the brand\u0026#39;s NAS servers. These devices are usually priced aggressively to take on Synology with better specifications and you could think of its TerraMaster OS (TOS) as a similar affair on the software side. It won\u0026#39;t win design awards but TOS gets the job done.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eTerraMaster has worked hard in recent years to polish TOS and bring it up to the same standard as the competition. While there are still some ways to go, the company has made strides to get where it is today. You\u0026#39;ll likely only find some minor issues with design element inconsistencies, slight mistranslations with newer features, and a lack of first-party apps, though full Docker container support is present.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eTOS is the OS to go with if you prefer a barebones experience with very little bloat to get in your way of creating your dream NAS.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"qnap-qts\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e3 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            QNAP QTS\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"user-friendly-yet-capable\"\u003e\n            User-friendly yet capable\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eQNAP focuses on getting you to your destination when using their web interface.
