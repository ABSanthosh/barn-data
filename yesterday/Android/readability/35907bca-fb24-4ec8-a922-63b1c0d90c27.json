Cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated every day, and Windows laptops are a common target because of their high user base and not-so-closed environment. From sudden slow performance to seeing unexpected apps, all such signs indicate that your laptop is probably hacked. It's crucial to recognize the warning signs of a hacked laptop so that you can take immediate action to regain control over it. I'll share the 14 most common indications of a possible compromised laptop and also what actions you can take. All the signs listed here indicate a possible compromised laptop; however, they could happen due to various other reasons too. So, don't get frightened and thoroughly check for a hacking attempt on your device. Related 7 awful things that could infect your computer Learn about all the horrendous stuff that infects your poor computer. 14 Your laptop is running slower than usual A sudden drop in performance could indicate malicious activity Laptops slow down gradually, but if yours suddenly slows down after a recent online activity, it might be due to malware running in the background. Hackers often use your system's resources for tasks like cryptocurrency mining, data exfiltration, or even running botnets, all of which can slow down your device. Your laptop might struggle to open even simple apps like a browser or Notepad. In such situations, you can take these steps: Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) and check for unfamiliar processes consuming high CPU, memory, or disk usage. Look for names that seem random or don't match any known software you have installed. Run a full system scan using a trusted antivirus program. I recommend using tools like Windows Defender (built into Windows) or third-party options like Malwarebytes. Uninstall any suspicious programs from the Control Panel. Sometimes, malware disguises itself as legitimate software, so be thorough in your review. Regularly update your software and operating system to patch vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit. Outdated software is one of the easiest ways for hackers to gain access to your system. 13 Unusual battery drain Excessive battery drain can signal unauthorized background processes It's normal that a laptop's battery life diminishes over time, especially when you use it regularly. However, if your laptop's battery is depleting faster than usual, it's possible that malware or unauthorized apps are running in the background. These processes often consume significant power, even when your laptop is idle. Here's what you need to do: Check the battery usage report in Settings \u003e System \u003e Power \u0026 Battery. Expand the Battery Usage section to check which apps are consuming the most power. Identify and terminate any suspicious apps or processes. If you see an app you don't recognize using a lot of power, it's worth investigating further. Perform a malware scan using a reliable antivirus tool. Some malware is designed to hide itself, so a thorough scan is essential. 12 Strange pop-ups and ads Unexpected pop-ups and ads are a classic sign of adware If you're seeing random pop-ups or ads, even when you're not browsing the internet, your laptop might be infected with adware. It's a type of malware that malicious actors develop to generate revenue by displaying intrusive advertisements. This recently happened to me when my browser was hijacked and bombarded with pop-ups every few seconds, making it nearly impossible to use. In such a situation, you can take these steps: Install an ad-blocker extension for your browser. Tools like uBlock Origin (or uBlock Origin Lite) can help block unwanted ads. Run a malware scan to detect and remove adware. Sometimes, adware embeds itself deeply into your system, so a full scan is necessary. Carefully check the installed extensions on your browser. Uninstall or disable the ones you don't remember installing or don't need anymore. To eliminate unwanted extensions, reset your browser settings to default. Go to your browser's settings and look for the option to restore defaults. Avoid clicking on suspicious ads or downloading software from untrusted sources. Always verify the legitimacy of a website before downloading anything. 11 Unusual changes to the browser Browser hijacking is a common tactic used by hackers Browser hijacking is a popular form of taking control of your internet activities and, eventually, your whole device. If your browser's homepage, search engine, or extensions have recently been changed without your consent, it's likely due to browser hijacking malware. To counter it, follow these steps: Reset your browser settings to default. This will remove any unwanted changes and restore your browser to its original state. Remove any suspicious extensions or add-ons. Go to your browser's extensions menu and delete anything you don't recognize. Run a malware scan to eliminate the root cause (probably an adware program). This will help ensure that the hijacking malware is completely removed.

These pop-ups look pretty convincing, with official logos and urgent messages, literally scaring you to take immediate action. I've often seen warnings claiming to be from Microsoft or other reputable companies, but they're almost always fake. When facing such warnings: Do not click on any links or buttons in the pop-up. Closing the pop-up directly might trigger more alerts, so use Task Manager to end the process. If the pop-up doesn't go away, use the Task Manager to close it. Also, look for suspicious browser processes and end them. Run a full system scan with a trusted antivirus program. This will help identify and remove any malware that causes fake warnings. Always verify the source of security warnings and avoid downloading software from unverified websites. If you're unsure, visit the company's official website, which should be mentioned in the warning. 9 Seeing Command Prompt window on system startup A Command Prompt window appearing at startup could indicate malicious activity If you notice a Command Prompt (CMD) window flashing or staying open briefly when your laptop starts up, it's a potential sign that a script or malware is running in the background. Although it can also be due to a harmless startup process, it's best to identify the source. Hackers often use scripts to execute commands that can install malware, steal data, or modify system settings without your knowledge. What you can do is: Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager and check for any suspicious startup programs under the Startup tab. Disable anything that seems unfamiliar or unnecessary. Next, launch Task Scheduler and look for any unusual scheduled task or process, especially those scheduled to run on startup. Run a full system scan using a trusted antivirus program. Malware often uses scripts to execute commands, so a thorough scan is essential. Disabled security tools are a red flag for hacking attempts If security tools like antivirus or firewall have been turned off on your laptop without your knowledge, it's a strong indication that someone is trying to bypass your system's defenses. Hackers do this as soon as they get access to your device so that they can install malware without detection. In such a situation, you need to be proactive, and here's what to do: Immediately turn off the internet/Wi-Fi connection on your laptop. If the security apps are disabled, the intruders may have already started malicious activities on your device. Re-enable your antivirus and firewall immediately. Go to your security settings and make sure everything is turned on. Check for any unauthorized changes in your security settings. Sometimes, malware will modify settings to weaken your defenses. Scan your system with a portable security solution. Always have a portable malware removal tool for such emergencies. It's always good to have a backup plan in case your primary antivirus fails. 7 Unknown software installed Unfamiliar programs could be malicious While using your device, if you notice new software you don't remember installing, it could be malware like a keylogger or a backdoor installed by a hacker. Follow these steps if you suspect unusual apps on your laptop: Go to Control Panel \u003e Programs \u003e Uninstall a Program and remove any suspicious software. Look for anything that seems out of place or has a vague name. Run a malware scan to ensure no remnants are left behind. If not entirely removed, some malware can reinstall itself. Review your installed programs regularly to catch any unauthorized additions. Make it a habit to check your installed programs list every few weeks. Always download software from official sources or trusted websites. Avoid third-party download sites, as they often bundle malware with legitimate software. 6 Mouse pointer moving on its own An autonomous mouse pointer could mean remote access If your mouse pointer is moving or clicking without your input, someone might be remotely controlling your laptop. This is one of the creepiest signs of a hack, and it's something I've thankfully never experienced personally, but I've heard plenty of stories on the internet. In this case, you can follow these steps: Disconnect your laptop from the internet immediately. This will cut off the hacker's access to your system. Check for remote access software like TeamViewer or AnyDesk and uninstall it. These programs are often used legitimately, but they can also be exploited by hackers. Open Task Manager and check if any suspicious app is using the system resources. If your laptop has too much sensitive data, consider using a hardware firewall to secure your internet connection. This can help prevent unauthorized access to your system. 5 Webcam or microphone turns on randomly Unauthorized access to your webcam or microphone is a privacy nightmare Sometimes, you might notice that your webcam's light is activated all of a sudden or your laptop's microphone activates without your permission. If that's happening to you, it's a clear sign that someone has infiltrated your device and is spying on you. The good thing is, it's pretty rare, risky, and difficult to perform such a level of hacking, and it is generally done for something extremely rewarding. So, mostly, it's a paranoia of a person. If you still feel someone is watching or listening to you on your laptop, here's what you can do. Cover your webcam when not in use. This is a simple but effective way to protect your privacy. You can use sticky paper for this. Disable your webcam and microphone in Device Manager. This will prevent them from being accessed without your knowledge. Go to Settings \u003e Privacy \u0026 Security and check the camera and microphone permissions. Turn off the permissions for the unverified and not-in-use apps. 4 Frequent crashes or blue screen errors System instability can be caused by malware Your system was running smoothly, but suddenly, it started to crash randomly and display blue screens. If that's the case, it could be due to malware interfering with your system files. Some malicious programs can reach your system folder and harm essential files, leading to crashes, freezing, and BSODs. Here's what you should do: Run a full system scan to detect and remove malware. Update your drivers and operating system to fix any compatibility issues. Outdated drivers can sometimes cause crashes. Perform a system restore to revert to a previous stable state. This can help fix any system file corruption caused by malware. Run file-repairing commands such as SFC and DISM. Regularly back up your data to avoid losing important files during crashes. This can save you a lot of headaches in the long run. 3 Unusual network activity High network usage could indicate data theft Hackers use malicious programs to send and receive data from your laptop to their servers. If your laptop is using an unusually high amount of network bandwidth, it might be sending or receiving data without your knowledge. What to do: First of all, disconnect from the internet and run a malware scan. This will help prevent further data theft. Use Task Manager or a network monitoring tool to identify suspicious activity. Look for any processes using a lot of network bandwidth. Change your Wi-Fi password and enable network encryption. This will help secure your network and prevent unauthorized access. Use a firewall to monitor and block unauthorized network traffic. This can help protect your system from data theft. 2 Hard drive is constantly running A perpetually active hard drive could indicate malicious activity When an infiltrator gets access to your system, some process will always be active in your background, even when your laptop is idle. So, you might observe that your hard disk is constantly being used, indicating a potential hacking attempt. If that's what you suspect, here's what you should do: Restart your system. Sometimes, a genuine process might be stuck in an endless loop, causing continuous hard disk activity. Check Task Manager for any suspicious processes. Look for anything using a lot of disk activity. Run a full system scan to detect and remove malware. 1 Receive ransomware messages Ransomware locks your files and demands payment If all the files on your computer are locked and renamed with a weird extension, and you get a message or Notepad text file demanding payment to unlock your files, your laptop has been infected with ransomware. Unfortunately, there's nothing much you can do about it because the attacker won't release the decryption key for your encrypted files without getting a ransom. Here's how you can handle this situation: Disconnect your laptop from the internet to prevent further damage. This will help prevent the ransomware from spreading. Do not pay the ransom, as there is no guarantee that your files will be restored. Paying the ransom only encourages further attacks. Try using ransomware decryption tools available online to recover your files. If you're lucky, you might decrypt the files without paying the ransom. Enable Windows ransomware protection from security settings. Regularly back up your data to avoid losing it to ransomware attacks. Also, ransomware mostly infiltrates a system when you download anything from suspicious sources. So, avoid such practices. Stay vigilant and take quick action A Windows laptop hacking attempt is rare but can happen to anyone, especially when you aren't careful with your online activities and ignore the malicious indications. With the signs listed in this article, you'll be able to identify whether your device is compromised and what actions you can take if stuck in such scenarios. Remember, the best defense is a good offense, so regularly update your software, use strong passwords, and back up your files to stay one step ahead of hackers.",
