  "text": "Motorola’s “E” series has come a long way since its initial debut around a decade ago, and as with most budget phones these days the Moto E phones have evolved to feature more “competent” hardware features, at least for the price. Take for example the Moto E15, which joins Motorola’s latest lineup of Android phones. Running with the lightweight Android 14 Go edition inside, the phone packs a 6.67-inch LCD screen with an HD+ resolution (that’s 1604 × 720 pixels) as well as a 90hz refresh rate. The phone is powered by a MediaTek Helio G81 chip with 2GB of RAM, and there’s also 64GB of expandable storage, as well as a large 5,200 mAh battery with support for 18W charging speeds.

At the moment, there’s no price listing for the device but we can expect it to go head-to-head with phones such as Samsung’s Galaxy A-series models and a number of Xiaomi Redmi smartphones.",
