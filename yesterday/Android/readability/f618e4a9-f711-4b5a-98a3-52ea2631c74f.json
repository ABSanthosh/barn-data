  "text": "Not too long ago, Nothing finally unveiled the Nothing Phone 2a Plus Community Edition, which featured a somewhat new take on a current device with design input from Nothing Phone fans, from the phone’s exterior design all the way to UI elements like wallpapers. If you were hoping to grab one for yourself however, you might be out of luck. Only 1,000 units of the phone will be made, and Nothing says that the phone sold out from its online store in just under 15 minutes. If you missed the initial online sale however, you can still get the phone via a limited release on November 16 via Nothing’s physical store in Soho, London. While the Community Edition’s specs remain pretty much the same as the regular 2a Plus, the phone’s main highlight is its glow-in-the-dark design, which adds a bit of lighting to the glyph interface (which itself already packs an LED lighting system) whenever the lights are off. In terms of specs, the Nothing Phone 2a Plus comes with a MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro chipset, a 6.7-inch display, a 50MP main camera, as well as a 5,000 mAh battery.",
