  "description": "Today we have with us the new 2024 Mac mini, which features a new design and the latest Apple M4 processor. The new Mac mini is an incredibly small computer, measuring just five inches in length and breadth while being just under two inches tall. The design is just over an inch bigger than the latest Apple TV 4K model, which is incredible when you consider the Mac mini is a full-fledged computer. The packaging for the new model isn’t that much wider than the computer itself, which is typical for Apple. It’s also relatively empty with just a power cable inside, which is also...",

The new Mac mini is an incredibly small computer, measuring just five inches in length and breadth while being just under two inches tall. The design is just over an inch bigger than the latest Apple TV 4K model, which is incredible when you consider the Mac mini is a full-fledged computer. The packaging for the new model isn’t that much wider than the computer itself, which is typical for Apple. It’s also relatively empty with just a power cable inside, which is also typical of Apple. The new Mac mini has a reworked port layout. On the back are three Thunderbolt ports, which are Thunderbolt 5 on the M4 Pro model and Thunderbolt 4 on the M4. You also get HDMI 2.1, Gigabit Ethernet (with optional 10Gbps upgrade), and the power connector. New to this generation are ports on the front, which includes two USB-C ports, a power LED, and a headphone jack. The Mac mini offers you the choice of M4 or M4 Pro processors with a range of memory and storage options. Our unit here is the absolute base model, which features the M4 processor, 16GB memory, and 256GB storage and comes in at $599. We figured this would be the most popular model this time around (it’s undoubtedly the best value) so we went with this one. Over the next few days, we will be putting this little computer through its paces, checking for productivity performance, gaming, and thermals. Stay tuned for the full review and let us know if there’s anything in particular you’d like to see tested.",
