  "description": "Google is expected to announce the Pixel 10 series of smartphones on August 20. Today a new leak tells us that the phones' telephoto camera is getting a new feature: the ability to take macro shots. Thus, it will be a tele-macro. Interestingly, Google reportedly plans to continue fitting its Pixels with ultrawide cameras with autofocus - which means the ultrawides will continue to have macro abilities of their own. The ultrawides will be able to focus closer than the telephotos, so you'll get a choice between using the ultrawide or the telephoto for close-up shots but it's not really a...",

The ultrawides will be able to focus closer than the telephotos, so you'll get a choice between using the ultrawide or the telephoto for close-up shots but it's not really a choice - logic dictates use the telephoto unless what you're trying to capture is closer than its minimum focusing distance, in which case the ultrawide will save the day (presumably with worse quality, but a macro shot is better than no macro shot). The Pixel 10 devices are rumored to become available on August 28. They will be powered by the new Tensor G5 SoC, manufactured by TSMC for the first time (which will hopefully translate into better performance and efficiency than its Samsung-made predecessors). Google is switching up its phones' colorways this time around, as reported a few days ago. And all of them should support Qi2 wireless charging, but not with built-in magnets a la Apple - instead, Google's cases will provide the magnets. Source",
