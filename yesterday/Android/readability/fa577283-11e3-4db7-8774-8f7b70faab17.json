  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account If you're looking to reduce the cost of your wireless plan, going with a prepaid carrier might be the way to go. Not only will you get excellent wireless coverage, but brands often feature impressive discounts for those looking to switch. Related With that said, Total Wireless is making a huge push right now, offering some exciting promotions that look to lure Cricket and Metro customers to their brand. The wireless carrier is now taking 50% off its usual pricing for those that are looking to switch, which means plans now start at just $20. A tempting offer for those looking to switch So if the promotion sounds tempting, there are a few things you need to know before jumping in. First is that you need to currently be a customer on Metro or Cricket that's looking to switch carriers. You'll also need an unlocked device, so that you can use the service once it's activated. The fine print also states that you need to switch from a comparable unlimited plan in order to take advantage, which means, if you're on a $30 plan on Cricket, then you'll need to get something similar from Total Wireless. If you're unsure about this point, we recommend speaking to someone from the brand in order to get things clarified before making the change. For the most part, though, since Total Wireless is a competitor, there are plans that are similar to those being offered by Cricket and Metro. On the Base plan, you'll get unlimited talk, text, and data for just $20 per month, and the Total 5G plan will offer the same, with just faster data, along with 15GB of hotspot data for $25 per month. Those looking to get the most out of their plan will want to opt for the Total 5G+ plan that cost $30 per month, which adds unlimited hotspot access. The plans look pretty good thanks to the impressive 50% discount. All the plans will reward subscribers for sticking around for 12 months with a $200 credit that can be used to purchase a new handset. For the most part, not a bad deal considering that you're score 50% off. Perhaps the cherry on top here is that Total Wireless is offering a five-year price lock on all its plans, which should provide some peace of mind for anyone that's looking to switch. Total Wireless Total Wireless is a Verizon-owned prepaid carrier with three unlimited plans and solid multi-line discounts. Total even included hotspot data on all of its plans as well as data roaming in Mexico and Canada.",

The wireless carrier is now taking 50% off its usual pricing for those that are looking to switch, which means plans now start at just $20.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"a-tempting-offer-for-those-looking-to-switch\"\u003e\n                        A tempting offer for those looking to switch\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eSo if the promotion sounds tempting, there are a few things you need to know before jumping in. First is that you need to currently be a customer on Metro or Cricket that\u0026#39;s looking to switch carriers. You\u0026#39;ll also need an unlocked device, so that you can use the service once it\u0026#39;s activated.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe fine print also states that you need to switch from a comparable unlimited plan in order to take advantage, which means, if you\u0026#39;re on a $30 plan on Cricket, then you\u0026#39;ll need to get something similar from Total Wireless. If you\u0026#39;re unsure about this point, we recommend speaking to someone from the brand in order to get things clarified before making the change.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFor the most part, though, since Total Wireless is a competitor, there are plans that are similar to those being offered by Cricket and Metro. On the Base plan, you\u0026#39;ll get unlimited talk, text, and data for just $20 per month, and the Total 5G plan will offer the same, with just faster data, along with 15GB of hotspot data for $25 per month.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThose looking to get the most out of their plan will want to opt for the Total 5G+ plan that cost $30 per month, which adds unlimited hotspot access. The plans look pretty good thanks to the impressive 50% discount. All the plans will reward subscribers for sticking around for 12 months with a $200 credit that can be used to purchase a new handset.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFor the most part, not a bad deal considering that you\u0026#39;re score 50% off. Perhaps the cherry on top here is that Total Wireless is offering a five-year price lock on all its plans, which should provide some peace of mind for anyone that\u0026#39;s looking to
