We saw photos of the Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra's display assembly, giving us an idea of the lineup's fronts. We also saw a render of One UI 7's new control (command?) center on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. MediaTek announced the flagship 3nm Dimensity 9400 SoC. It's built on TSMC's 3nm N3E node, has a Cortex-X925 prime core running at up to 3.63GHz, and three Cortex-X4s at 3.3GHz. The GPU is Immortalis-G925, which was announced earlier this year. It runs at 1612 MHz frequency, promising 41% performance improvement, 40% faster ray tracing performance, and 44% power savings. The AI is handled by the NPU 890, which should consume 35% less energy than its predecessor. MediaTek is already shipping Dimensity 9400 chips to OEMs. We expect to see the flagship platform in the Oppo Find X8 and vivo X200 series this month. Vivo's upcoming X200 series was all over the news this week. The X200 Pro and X200 Pro mini will adopt the vivo X100 Ultra's 200MP periscope shooter. The series will feature the aforementioned Dimensity 9400. Speaking of chipsets, we heard the Exynos 2500 is facing yield issues and could force Samsung to use only Snapdragon chips in the Galaxy S25 series.",
