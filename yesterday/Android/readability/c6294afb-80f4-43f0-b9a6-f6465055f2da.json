  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary One UI 7's rollout was a mess, with Samsung missing its July 2024 beta deadline and only releasing it widely in April 2025. Reliable leaks suggest One UI 8's beta might arrive as early as June 2025, possibly launching with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7. One UI 8 likely won’t introduce any major UI changes, but will serve as a refined version of One UI 7. By now, it's clear that Android 15-based One UI 7's journey was rocky (and frankly, embarrassing) to say the least. Despite being one of the biggest redesigns we've seen in the One UI lineup, the company really messed it up with its release timeline. Initially, Samsung claimed that One UI 7's beta would launch in July 2024, but it didn’t push it out until December 2024, after months of making fans wait and deal with leak after leak. Although the stable version first debuted on the Galaxy S25 series, the company twisted things around yet again... by not launching it on other devices. Of course, not a lot of people would be willing to upgrade their device to the latest lineup solely to get a taste of what One UI 7 had to offer. Samsung finally ended up rolling out the stable version widely on April 10 in the United States, and ironically, the delays didn’t end there either. The company had to postpone the rollout due to a \"major\" bug in the stable release firmware, even after six months of testing. While it’s unclear what exactly that bug was, it was likely significant enough for Samsung to risk testing the patience of already-frustrated fans even further. One UI 7 finally arrived on all eligible flagships in the US earlier this week, and though it triggered a battery life issue on the Galaxy S24 and the Fold 7, at least the wait is finally over. Related 6 hidden One UI 7 features you probably missed Samsung has paid attention to the little things Fortunately, new leaks suggest that Samsung may have finally learned its lesson, and that this won't be the case with the next update. One UI 8 beta might drop in June 2025, if we're lucky A new post from reliable tipster @tarunvats33 on X (formerly Twitter) suggests that Samsung might launch the One UI 8 beta as early as June (via SamMobile). While the company has been testing the Android 16-based One UI internally even when One UI 7 was clearly not under control, this isn't entirely a surprise, since previous leaks have suggested that Samsung will roll out One UI 8 \"sooner than previously thought.\" Though the One UI 7 delay fiasco has left most fans struggling to trust Samsung's words this time around, this could be because the company plans to roll out its upcoming foldables, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7, with One UI 8 out of the box, possibly as a way to make up for the delay. Tarun, the tipster mentioned above, expects One UI 8's stable version to launch in August or September 2025. However, he also goes on to mention that it's best to take this information with a grain of salt, since \"Samsung’s update timelines can shift anytime.\" Nonetheless, from what we've seen so far, One UI 8 will focus on minor refinements and won’t bring any major UI changes. It'll mostly be a more polished version of One UI 7, with improvements like rolling out Now Brief and Log video to all of Samsung’s 2024 flagships that don’t have them yet.",

Despite being one of the biggest redesigns we\u0026#39;ve seen in the One UI lineup, the company really messed it up with its release timeline. Initially, Samsung claimed that One UI 7\u0026#39;s beta would launch in July 2024, but it didn’t push it out until December 2024, after months of making fans wait and deal with leak after leak. Although the stable version first debuted on the Galaxy S25 series, the company twisted things around yet again... by not launching it on other devices.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, not a lot of people would be willing to upgrade their device to the latest lineup solely to get a taste of what One UI 7 had to offer. Samsung finally ended up rolling out the stable version widely on April 10 in the United States, and ironically, the delays didn’t end there either. The company had to \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-hits-pause-on-one-ui-7-rollout-due-to-major-bug/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epostpone the rollout due to a \u0026#34;major\u0026#34; bug\u003c/a\u003e in the stable release firmware, even after six months of testing.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhile it’s unclear what exactly that bug was, it was likely significant enough for Samsung to risk testing the patience of already-frustrated fans even further. \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/one-ui-7-2021-2022-flagship-rollout-us/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOne UI 7 finally arrived on all eligible flagships in the US\u003c/a\u003e earlier this week, and though it triggered a battery life issue on the Galaxy S24 and the Fold 7, at least the wait is finally over. \u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n                                        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n
