There's a reason why October has been given the nickname of Techtober. There's something about the month that ushers in the last quarter of the year that just makes smartphone manufacturers rush to throw phones into the market. This year, it's no different at all. We knew that Oppo and OnePlus, two closely linked smartphone manufacturers, were going to be launching their newest flagship devices this month. However, we've gotten reassurance that's the case for the OnePlus 13 and the Oppo Find X8 series now has an actual date to look forward to. The Oppo Find X8 Series Is Going To Be Arriving On October 24th, Just Two Weeks Away Image: Oppo I've never owned an Oppo device but I've always admired the company's flagship devices from far away. The Oppo Find X8 series has even more reason to be admired as the company has confirmed that it'll be the first Find series to go global since the Find X5 family—that means you can actually get your hands on this one, at some undisclosed time in the future. Over on Weibo, Oppo has confirmed that the Find X8 series is going to be showing up on October 24th, which is exactly two weeks away from today. That's good news. It will be a China-only release, which might dampen your excitement some, but since it'll eventually go global, you can get a good look at the device and decide if you want to get one for yourself eventually. Image: Oppo The company hasn't made anything about the device official beyond the chipset that we can expect, and as the rumors said, it will be the MediaTek Dimensity 9400. The chip was announced yesterday and it is quite a monster. Even if you're a Snapdragon lover, there's more than enough performance here to not know the difference. The OnePlus 13 Will Also Come Out Before October Ends; Expect Plenty Of Power The OnePlus 12 was a spectacular smartphone. This year, OnePlus seems set to one-up themselves, with the OnePlus 13 set to launch this month. We heard last month that we would be able to expect it this month and a OnePlus exec has just reiterated that on Weibo. There's no date known yet, so it might make it in before October ends. Just like the Oppo though, this release is for China, before the global release some time later. Image: OnePlus Just like with the Oppo too, we've gotten official confirmation of the chipset that will be inside, which is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 4. That's hardly a surprise. OnePlus flagships have been relatively faithful to Qualcomm since the OEM's inception. With the new processor, we've been told to expect a “big leap” in performance and smoothness. Considering it's rumored the device will come with 24GB, that's not a ridiculous claim. Wait Until October Is Over Before You Buy That New Flagship There are going to be a lot of smartphone launches in the month of October. If you're looking to get yourself a new flagship phone, I'd recommend waiting until the month is over, as you'll have at least four new flagships to consider—Oppo, OnePlus, Xiaomi, and Vivo are all slated for a flagship release this month. Honor might be in the mix too. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post Next Post",
