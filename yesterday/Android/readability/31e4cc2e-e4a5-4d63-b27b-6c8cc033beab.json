The Pixel 4a is among Google's oldest smartphones still in circulation today. It may not have the latest hardware today, but it was a standout model at the time of its release in 2020. Early this year, Google rolled out a surprise Android 13-based Pixel 4a Battery Performance Program for the device. It's the first update to come since they ended support in September 2023. Ironically, the program brought more issues for users, and it doesn't help that the company has now removed all previous updates. You can no longer revert to an earlier stable version of the software.  No more rolling back to older updates on Pixel 4a It was a surprising day for users on January 8, 2025, when Google rolled out the Pixel 4a Battery Performance Program. The update was meant to fix battery problems on some Pixel 4a phones. But, instead of helping, the update caused battery life to get worse Phones drained very quickly, and the battery indicator became inaccurate. Some users saw their phones go from 100% to almost empty in less than usual, even with little use. Google has determined that certain Pixel 4a phones require a software update to improve the stability of their battery’s performance. An automatic update to Android 13 will roll out to all Pixel 4a devices starting January 8, 2025. For some devices (“Impacted Devices”), the software update reduces available battery capacity and impacts charging performance. We want our customers to have the best possible experience with their products, so users of these Impacted Devices are eligible for an appeasement from Google. Image: Google Google then offered users a free battery replacement. If you didn't want the replacement, you could get $50 or a $100 discount on a new Pixel phone. It makes sense if you preferred neither and wanted to revert to older software versions to recalibrate your phone. However, that's no longer possible. Google has removed all previous Pixel 4a updates. Days ago, Pixel 4a owners discovered something disturbing. The company had removed all older firmware downloads for the phone from the Factory and Full OTA Images for Nexus and Pixel Devices website. Image: Google The only available update is the recent one (TQ3A.230805.001.S2), while Images for the Pixel 4a 5G model still remain. Now, you're stuck with a problematic update that will eventually force you to make a choice: Either get a battery replacement or put the appeasement money towards buying a new device entirely. Related: The Pixel 10a Could Make an Unpopular Downgrade to Save Costs Why did Google really launch a battery program? According to Google, the lithium-ion batteries in their Pixel phones naturally degrade over time, affecting their performance. Their program was an effort to address faster-than-expected degradation in some devices. But the explanation is not enough for users who are already sharing conspiracy theories. Some are saying it's a planned move to force you to upgrade. Others say it's possible they want to avoid a PR nightmare, especially if the issue is a faulty battery or hardware that could cause safety problems. Many made reference to the Galaxy Note 7 explosions in 2016, which later led Samsung to recall all models. Image: Google It makes the more probable reason, since users didn't have much of a choice in the matter. While Google's battery program update could be manually downloaded, most users eventually had it automatically pushed to their devices when it was released. Some even reported receiving their purchased phones in special packaging with warnings and safety measures for handling a possibly damaged battery.  In the meantime, it's not all pitchforks and curses raised against Google. Some shared solutions may be your saving grace. Users are installing LineageOS on their Pixel 4a, and the necessary Google apps from a third-party website. As claimed, the result is an upgraded device to Android 15 and a stable battery. Irene is an experienced writer with four years in the Tech, E-commerce, and Food niches.
