Learn more. 2025 has been full of wild things, but if there’s one weird happening that I didn’t expect to see, it was the launch of a whole Donald Trump-themed mobile carrier. I know the president of the US made waves as a businessman, but I don’t think that you’ll disagree with me that a carrier is a very odd place to pitch your tent. The carrier currently has only one plan, but to pair with that, it also has a single smartphone that you can opt for. The Trump T1 Phone proudly stated via the official Trump Mobile website that it was “Made in the USA”, which tracks, considering the president’s philosophy. However, all is not as it seems, and that claim might be entirely untrue. The Trump T1 Phone Has Gone From Made in the USA to “American-Proud Design” Image: White House There’s nothing wrong with phones being manufactured in China. Even if you’re not buying your device from a Chinese OEM, the likelihood that the device itself was put together in China is very high. The populous Asian nation is a manufacturing giant, and that’s most notable when it comes to electronics. However, there’s a big problem with making phones in China if you’re Donald Trump. The President of the United States has held a combative stance against China for a long time, and most recently, that was shown with massive reciprocal tariffs placed against the country. The idea was to promote production in the US, so if Trump was going to release a product, it’d only make sense for that product to be manufactured in the US, right? Image: Trump Mobile That’s what we thought, too, so it made sense when we saw that the Trump T1 Phone, under the Trump Mobile carrier, was proudly stated to be made in the USA. Confusingly, that assertion isn’t being made anymore and has disappeared from the website entirely. Instead, we see lines like: “Designed with American values in mind” “Proudly American” “Brought to life right here in the USA” That wording seems to want to infuse the device with American values, if the flag on the back didn’t do enough of that, but it now refuses to allude to where the device might have been made. That’s probably a smarter choice. The Device’s Specs Have Changed As Well; Expect a Smaller Phone Image: Trump Mobile The claim of being born in the USA isn’t the only thing that silently gets changed regarding the phone. It has also had its spec sheet modified to some extent, with some aspects changing pretty drastically. Either there was a big mistake from the start, or the manufacturer originally contracted to make the phone has been dropped in favor of another. Here’s a look at how the “new” specs of the device contrast with the old ones: New Trump T1 SpecsOld Trump T1 SpecsScreen6.25-inch AMOLED, 120Hz6.78-inch AMOLED, 120HzStorage256GB256GB, expandableMemoryN/A12GBRear Cameras50MP + 2MP macro + 2MP depth50MP + 2MP macro + 2MP depthSelfie Cameras16MP16MPBattery5,000mAh5,000mAhCharging20W20W wiredLaunch Date“Later This Year”August/September So, not only does the phone get notably smaller (joining a limited variety of compact phones), but for some reason, the carrier has cleared the RAM spec from its website.
