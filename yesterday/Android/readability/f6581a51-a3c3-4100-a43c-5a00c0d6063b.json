There are also instances where it can be used to summarize things like emails, text messages, and more. But it seems that with Galaxy AI, Samsung is thinking outside the box where maybe AI could be used to replace the Settings menu one day. According to a report from ETNews, Samsung is working on a new Galaxy AI feature that would allow users to adjust their phone settings without having to go into the settings menu, and this will be accomplished with Galaxy AI. It seems that this will rely on AI “that can predict what consumers want in advance by improving the performance of ‘touch points’ such as keyboard and camera.” We’re not sure what exactly that means, so we’ll have to wait and see. As SamMobile notes, perhaps we’ve already gotten a preview of what that could look like in the One UI software for Samsung’s smart TVs. It shows users frequently accessed menu items when you launch the Settings app. This saves users time from having to go through their settings all over again. It sounds quite interesting, but whether or not it will be useful remains to be seen. There’s no word on when this new AI feature will roll out, but we’ll keep our eyes peeled.
