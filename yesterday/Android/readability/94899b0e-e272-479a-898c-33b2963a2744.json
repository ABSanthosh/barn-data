  "text": "With the Nintendo Switch 2 arriving soon, now feels like a great time to figure out what's missing from the Nintendo Switch Online SNES collection. While the service does contain many classic games from that system, it doesn't include everything you would want. Nintendo has confirmed that it will continue to support NSO, with the announcement that GameCube games will be added to the Expansion Pack version of the subscription. While there are several changes Nintendo could make to NSO in Switch 2, hopefully, one of those changes will no longer involve adding SNES games to the service. In addition to all the Switch 2 games I'm excited to play, I want to add five more SNES games to the service. For these five games, we went with games not on the service and not available on Nintendo Switch in their original form in the eShop. I also tried to avoid highly unlikely games due to licensing, but a few iconic games can't go unmentioned, even if the chances are low. Related 9 Nintendo franchises we want Switch 2 releases from With the Switch 2 on the way, here's the series I want to see return this console generation. 5 Chrono Trigger One of the most iconic JRPGs of all time should be playable on Switch Chrono Trigger is, without question, one of the greatest and most influential RPGs of all time. However, Square Enix has not done the best job keeping it relevant, with Chrono Trigger available in only a few select places. It is on Steam and mobile devices, but it's not available on any of the modern consoles, including the Nintendo Switch. Square Enix has made multiple exclusives or timed exclusives on Switch, like Triangle Strategy or Octopath Traveler, so the two companies appear to have a friendly relationship. While some people are holding out hope for an HD-2D remake of Chrono Trigger, it's an excellent candidate for NSO. While a remake would be great, it's important for people to have access to the original version of the game. Even if there are rough edges or quality-of-life features that now feel standard that are missing, being able to see as close to an original version as possible is important for gaming culture. You wouldn't want the original versions of Robocop or Total Recall to be unavailable just because the remakes are available, right? Save states and rewinds would also make the Nintendo Switch Online version a great compromise of modern features and classic design choices. 4 Mario Paint Switch 2 mouse mode changes what games can be played Source: Nintendo Mario Paint is a game that made sense to not be included on Nintendo Switch Online. The game was made to work with a mouse controller for the SNES, something that wouldn't translate well to Switch controllers. However, Nintendo Switch 2 is a different beast for one simple reason: mouse mode. For anyone unaware, Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons will be able to go into mouse mode, where they can be placed flat on a surface and used like a computer mouse. So far, Nintendo has promoted this feature as an alternate way to play new games like Sid Meier's Civilization VII and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, but I think it could work for old games. Now, to be clear, I don't know if the mouse mode on the Switch 2 could easily be used to play Mario Paint on Nintendo Switch Online. That may require some effort on Nintendo's part to make it work, but Nintendo has made online multiplayer work in these retro classics, so it doesn't seem impossible. It's also one of the few fully Nintendo-owned games not on NSO, so there shouldn't be any issue when it comes to getting the rights. 3 Yoshi's Cookie This underrated puzzle game stars everyone's favorite green dinosaur Source: Nintendo Yoshi's Cookie is a tile-shifting puzzle game featuring Yoshi, and of course, Mario. There are tons of puzzle games on Nintendo Switch Online, including ones that play similarly to Yoshi's Cookie. However, this game does offer enough differences from Tetris and Puyo Puyo style puzzle games, which makes it unique enough to justify its existence. That said, it shouldn't have to justify its existence. There is no real argument for Nintendo to keep any of its first-party games from that era off the service. Yoshi's Cookie doesn't require a special controller or dealing with a third-party publisher, so there is no reason for it not to be on the service, even if it might not be popular. Nintendo has chosen to slowly roll out new NSO games, which is fine since it makes it easier to see new games on the service and check them out, but Yoshi's Cookie doesn't deserve to be forgotten over time. Related 2 NBA Jam Come on and slam, and welcome to the jam NBA Jam is probably a licensing nightmare for Nintendo to try to get on Nintendo Switch Online, especially considering the involvement of the NBA, players, and Midway Games no longer exists, although it appears the license is now owned by Electronic Arts, which published a modern game in 2010. Even with some of that to consider, there are also several player likenesses in the game, and some non-players, like Bill Clinton, but if Nintendo could make it happen, it would be huge. The 2v2 arcade basketball game took out fouls, let players jump unrealistically high, and created a streamlined version of basketball that still felt like basketball. There are many sports games from that time period that would be worth having, like NHL '94, but NBA Jam is the holy grail of arcade sports games from that era, and Nintendo has the money and connections to make it happen. 1 Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars Why not offer the classic version of this legendary RPG, too? Why would I choose a game that has a remaster (or remake, depending on who you ask) already on Nintendo Switch? It's simple, really. Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars is not only a classic RPG, it's also the formula that the modern Mario RPGs, like Paper Mario: The Origami King, are built on. In some cases, those Mario RPGs have been poorly received when they stray too far from the original. Being able to buy the shiny new version of Super Mario RPG for $60 is better than it not being on Switch at all, but there is no real reason for the original to be left out. The original features classic music, animation, and graphics, and letting people experience that original version in addition to the remaster gives modern games more historical context around their gaming. It's also not unprecedented for a game with a paid version to still appear on Nintendo Switch Online. Super Mario 64 was available in a paid package with Super Mario 3D All-Stars, which contained a slightly improved version of the game. That situation is a little different, since Super Mario 3D All-Stars was sold for a limited time, but all the same, it shows it's still possible. Square Enix would also need to be on board, but it let the remaster happen, so it seems like it might play ball. More classics waiting to come to Nintendo Switch Online While Nintendo hasn't made it clear how it will support older consoles on Nintendo Switch Online for Switch 2, it may shift its focus to GameCube games. Nintendo should continue to support consoles like the SNES when the Switch 2 launches, as those catalogs of games are still missing a few important and great games. While Nintendo did not promise to offer every game from those systems, the five games listed above feel like they need to come to the service, even if some feel like an impossible ask. Related",

Even if there are rough edges or quality-of-life features that now feel standard that are missing, being able to see as close to an original version as possible is important for gaming culture. You wouldn\u0026#39;t want the original versions of \u003cem\u003eRobocop \u003c/em\u003eor \u003cem\u003eTotal Recall\u003c/em\u003e to be unavailable just because the remakes are available, right? Save states and rewinds would also make the Nintendo Switch Online version a great compromise of modern features and classic design choices.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"mario-paint\"\u003e\n

a game that made sense to not be included on Nintendo Switch Online. The game was made to work with a mouse controller for the SNES, something that wouldn\u0026#39;t translate well to Switch controllers. However, Nintendo Switch 2 is a different beast for one simple reason: mouse mode. For anyone unaware, Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons will be able to go into mouse mode, where they can be placed flat on a surface and used like a computer mouse. So far, Nintendo has promoted this feature as an alternate way to play new games like \u003cem\u003eSid Meier\u0026#39;s Civilization VII \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eMetroid Prime 4: Beyond\u003c/em\u003e, but I think it could work for old games.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eNow, to be clear, I don\u0026#39;t know if the mouse mode on the Switch 2 could easily be used to play \u003cem\u003eMario Paint \u003c/em\u003eon Nintendo Switch Online. That may require some effort on Nintendo\u0026#39;s part to make it work, but Nintendo has made online multiplayer work in these retro classics, so it doesn\u0026#39;t seem impossible. It\u0026#39;s also one of the few fully Nintendo-owned games not on NSO, so there shouldn\u0026#39;t be any issue when it comes to getting the rights.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2

the license is now owned by Electronic Arts, which published a modern game in 2010.

That situation is a little different, since \u003cem\u003eSuper Mario 3D All-Stars \u003c/em\u003ewas sold for a limited time, but all the same, it shows it\u0026#39;s still possible.
