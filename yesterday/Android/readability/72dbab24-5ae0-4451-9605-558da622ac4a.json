As a world leader in AI and accelerated computing, NVIDIA has collaborated with Google and Alphabet for years on a wide variety of projects, including Android, advanced AI research, next-generation hardware and software optimizations, and beyond — all with the goal of making AI more accessible for developers.This week at the NVIDIA GTC global AI conference, we’re doubling down on our partnership with NVIDIA with announcements across Google and Alphabet:Google Cloud’s AI infrastructure will help transform businesses with NVIDIA’s latest GPUsTraining large AI models requires serious computing power, and NVIDIA continues to raise the bar on GPU performance. We’re excited to announce our A4 VM is now generally available, based on NVIDIA HGX B200 GPU — and our A4X VMs based on NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 will be available soon, too. We’re committed to supporting the latest Blackwell GPUs, including the just-announced NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell and NVIDIA GB300. This means faster training times, smoother deployments and the ability to tackle even more complex AI challenges.Google DeepMind and NVIDIA will make the power of Gemini available to more peopleGoogle DeepMind’s Gemini is the result of decades of large language model research and is our most capable AI model. This week we’ll share how rapid advances in Gemini are designed to support more developers and end users — and how our collaboration with NVIDIA is helping to make that possible.The Google DeepMind team also released Gemma 3 last week, the latest in our collection of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models. NVIDIA played a key role in the development of these open models, working closely with our researchers to optimize Gemma to run on its vast accelerated computing ecosystem. This means developers can easily access the same technology that powers Gemini and implement it on any NVIDIA GPU available to them.Separately, NVIDIA also announced today that it has employed Google DeepMind’s SynthID watermarking tool on its Cosmos video generation platform. This marks our first external deployment of the technology, and we’re proud to help instill user trust in AI-generated content.Alphabet and NVIDIA will use AI to tackle the world’s most complex issuesOur collaboration with NVIDIA isn’t just about building AI tools to help in daily life; it’s about fundamentally improving the quality of life for everyone. That means working together to apply AI to address some of the world’s most complex challenges. For starters, we’re teaming up to apply the most advanced frontier models to areas from energy to drug discovery.Smarter energy grids. Tapestry, X’s moonshot for the electric grid, and NVIDIA are researching methods to increase the speed and accuracy of electric grid simulations.Improved drug discovery. Isomorphic Labs and NVIDIA are advancing the development of new medicines using AI.More capable robots. Intrinsic and NVIDIA are making robots more intelligent and capable, with the integration of NVIDIA’s Isaac foundation models for more adaptive grasp capabilities.Advanced robotics simulation. Google DeepMind and NVIDIA are launching MuJoCo-Warp, a new open-source physics simulator that will accelerate robotics research.We’ve always believed that the value of technology lives in its capacity to benefit people everywhere. That’s been foundational to our mission and it’s what our growing collaboration with NVIDIA is built on. By combining Google’s expertise in AI research and infrastructure with NVIDIA’s leadership in accelerated computing, we’re committed to strengthening the foundation of AI, making AI more accessible and helpful to developers and users, and collaborating in ways that will drive innovation for years to come.If you’re attending GTC this week, swing by Google Cloud’s booth #914 and check out one of the many Google sessions to learn more about our work together.",
