  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Chrome for Android will soon allow users to archive tabs by dragging and dropping them. Users can test this feature in the latest Chrome Canary build. This new feature is set to be included in Chrome 139, which will release on July 30, 2025. There are a lot of choices when it comes to browsers. But if you're someone that's reliant on Google products, there's a pretty good chance you're using Chrome on mobile and desktop because of the added convenience of keeping things in sync. Related Luckily, Google's been really good at bringing updates and features to both versions, and we're now seeing something new pop up in the Canary build that could be quite interesting. The new feature, which was spotted by Leopeva64, will allow users to drag and drop tabs in order to archive them. Coming soon Source: Leopeva64 The good news is that this feature should be arriving in the public build of Chrome for Android very soon, slated to make an appearance in Chrome 139, which is scheduled to be released on July 30, 2025. As far as how the feature works, it's pretty simple. Users will be able to drag and drop open tabs into the Inactive tabs section in order to archive them. By doing so, users will be able to see the count of Inactive tabs increase each time one is added. You can see how this works thanks to Leopeva64's video above. For the most part, this looks like a pretty nice addition to Chrome, which some users should see some value. Of course, as mentioned before, this isn't something that's launching to the public today and can only be accessed if you're using the Canary build. You can give it a try if you'd like, but just be warned that it isn't the most stable, and you could experience some issues with it.",

we\u0026#39;re now seeing something new pop up in the Canary build that could be quite interesting. The new feature, which was spotted by \u003ca href=\"https://x.com/Leopeva64\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLeopeva64\u003c/a\u003e, will allow users to drag and drop tabs in order to archive them.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"coming-soon\"\u003e\n                        Coming soon\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://x.com/Leopeva64/status/1929600443706986984\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLeopeva64\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe good news is that this feature should be arriving in the public build of Chrome for Android very soon, slated to make an appearance in Chrome 139, which is scheduled to be released on July 30, 2025. As far as how the feature works, it\u0026#39;s pretty simple.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eUsers will be able to drag and drop open tabs into the Inactive tabs section in order to archive them. By doing so, users will be able to see the count of Inactive tabs increase each time one is added. You can see how this works thanks to \u003ca href=\"http://x.com/Leopeva64/status/1929600443706986984\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLeopeva64\u0026#39;s video above\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eFor the most part, this looks like a pretty nice addition to Chrome, which some users should see some value. Of course, as mentioned before, this isn\u0026#39;t something that\u0026#39;s launching to the public today and can only be accessed if you\u0026#39;re using the Canary build. You can give it a try if you\u0026#39;d like, but just be warned that it isn\u0026#39;t the most stable, and you could experience some issues with it. \u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n    \n\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
