In the early days of Android, there was more of a noticeable increase in the growth of different specifications, particularly displays. Just about 10 years ago, I had a device with a 4.5-inch screen, and I thought that was large. Having had experience with my dad's BlackBerry Storm with a 3.25-inch screen, I thought 4.5 was massive. Well, it's 2024 now and I have a smartphone with a 6.8-inch screen, and I genuinely think we've reached a plateau with how long devices have stayed below this mark. However, Nubia's gaming subbrand, RedMagic, clearly doesn't agree and all signs point to its next device coming with a 7-inch display. The RedMagic 10 Series Looks Set To Have At Least One Phone With An Insane 7-Inch Screen Image: RedMagic The largest screen you can get on a non-folding smartphone released this year is 6.95 inches, and that's the obscure Cubot Max 5. After that, there's the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max, but Android users don't want to hear that. Other than those two, you've got a massive variety of devices with 6.8-inch screens, since that seems to be the unofficial limit for most OEMs. We've seen 7 inches in the recent past, but none this year. RedMagic wants to change that, and potentially make these larger screens the trend. At least, that's what a leak from the typically reliable Digital Chat Station on Weibo points towards. After all, with bezels being at the narrowest they've ever been, a 7-inch smartphone wouldn't necessarily feel massive in your hands. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is just 0.2 inches away from that target. The RedMagic 10 Series Would Be Able To Put A 7-Inch Display To Good Use Image: RedMagic I do think that a bigger screen would suit RedMagic's upcoming devices particularly well too. After all, look at the RedMagic 9s Pro and 9s Pro+, and you'll see they utilize an under-display selfie camera, leaving the entire front of the phone entirely unblemished. As a gaming phone at that too, it should make your gaming sessions a lot more enjoyable. Another perk that will come along for the ride is a bigger footprint, which should mean more space for cooling hardware or at least a bigger battery. And, with the way that batteries are going right now, I wouldn't find myself surprised if the “7” that RedMagic is teasing also doubles for a 7,000 mAh battery. The RedMagic 10 Series Will Become Official On November 5th, With A Snapdragon 8 Elite Inside At the moment, nothing regarding the screen or battery is certain though, beyond the fact that “7” is going to somehow be relevant for these imminent gaming phones. Do you know what is certain though? The release date and the chip of choice. Image: RedMagic RedMagic has made it official that the RedMagic 10 series is going to be launching on November 5th, which is just roughly a week away. On top of that, we know for a fact that the chip of choice is going to be the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, which of course, is hardly surprising. There's expected to be a RedMagic 10 Pro, 10 Pro+, and 10 Ultra, and I'm particularly excited to see what the latter will bring. RedMagic phones are already crazy enough without adding an Ultra to the mix. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast.
