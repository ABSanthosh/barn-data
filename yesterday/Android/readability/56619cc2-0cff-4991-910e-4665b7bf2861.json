If you've forgotten to charge your phone or earbuds for the morning commute, Anker has launched an innovation that will change your life. The Soundcore P41i earbuds offer a 3-in-1 design, including earbuds, a built-in USB-C charging cable, a 3,000mAh battery, and even a built-in phone stand to watch your content hands-free. It's like someone at SoundCore had a brainstorming session on how to improve the P40i and came up with this. What's more, Soundcore's P41i earbuds don't cost the earth; they are reasonably priced at £89.99 Features: Portable Phone Charging: The case charges an iPhone 16 Pro to 50% or a Samsung Galaxy S24 to 45% with 10W of power and 3,000mAh of battery capacity. Ultra-long Battery Life: You can listen for up to 12 hours on a single charge, and the case extends this to 192 hours. A quick 10-minute charge gives you an extra 5 hours of listening time. Adaptive Noise Cancelling: The earbuds constantly monitor your surroundings and use advanced algorithms to block external noise, so you stay fully immersed in your audio when you're on the go. Thunderous Bass: Powerful 11-mm composite drivers deliver captivating sound enhanced by BassUp technology for intense, high-impact bass. Superior Call Quality: 6 microphones and AI noise reduction ensure you're heard loud and clear on important calls or urgent voicemails, wherever you are. Built-in Phone Stand: Watch your favourite shows on the move with ease. The patented design automatically snaps the stand back into its storage slot when you close your case for complete convenience. Built-in Display: Check the battery status of the earbuds and case, and how fast your phone is charging by looking at the display. It's not much of a stretch to say that Soundcore's new P41i earbuds could be the second most important thing to have in your pocket, after your phone. And at just £89.99, the P41i earbuds could be the difference between a bad trip and a great journey. You can pick up a set on Amazon and directly from Soundcore's online store. With over a decade's experience covering the world of Android and having reviewed more devices than he can count, Peter is excited about where the world of tech is heading. He is currently packing the Oppo Find X8 Pro, OnePlus Pad 2, and an ASUS Chromebook Plus. Previous Post",
