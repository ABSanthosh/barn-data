In addition, it also has a refresh rate of up to 240Hz and an excellent response time at 1ms. And just in case you need that extra boost, this monitor also offers support for AMD's Freesync Premium Pro that can reduce screen tearing when playing fast-paced games. The design is minimalist, but it also offers some customizable RGB just in case you want to add a pop of color to your desk setup.

As stated before, you get a 49-inch panel that delivers crisp details with vibrant colors and great contrast. Plus, it has a 1000R curvature that\u0026#39;s able to increase the level of immersion when playing your favorite games or when watching TV shows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis curve is also great when browsing the web and getting some work done as it can reduce eye strain as well. Since this is an ultrawide screen with a 32:9 aspect ratio, it does allow for some great perks, like being able to put two screens side by side without the need for two physical monitors. In addition, it also has a refresh rate of up to 240Hz and an excellent response time at 1ms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just in case you need that extra boost, this monitor also offers support for AMD\u0026#39;s Freesync Premium Pro that can reduce screen tearing when playing fast-paced games. The design is minimalist, but it also offers some customizable RGB just in case you want to add a pop of color to your desk setup. The monitor can also be adjusted in a number of ways for optimal viewing, with adjustments for tilt, swivel, and height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou really can\u0026#39;t go wrong with this monitor, especially now that it\u0026#39;s being discounted to $760.
