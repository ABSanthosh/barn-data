that\u0026#39;s got it priced at $40, and is also offering an additional 10% off, bringing the total down to just $36 for a limited time. The product ships directly from the retailer, which seems to have a pretty good track record, judging from the review left. It\u0026#39;s also offers fast shipping times as well. So if you\u0026#39;ve been thinking about buying a new controller, grab the 8BitDo Pro 2 for just $36 while you can. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"what-39-s-great-about-the-8bitdo-pro-2-controller\"\u003e\n                        What\u0026#39;s great about the 8BitDo Pro 2 controller?\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow if you were a gamer in the late 90s and early 2000s, chances are you\u0026#39;re going to recognize the design of this controller. While it might not be the fanciest controller out there, it does get the job done and is perfect if you\u0026#39;re looking to just have a blast while playing some retro games. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, this a controller built just for retro gaming and can be used on modern titles as well. As stated before, you\u0026#39;re getting great compatibility here with the ability to pair with Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS devices. As far as the sticks and buttons, you\u0026#39;re getting the usual here, and there\u0026#39;s even two programmable buttons located at the rear. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhile you can use the controller wired, you can also use it wirelessly, and it can be recharged using the controller\u0026#39;s USB-C port. As an added bonus, the controller has a removable battery that can be replaced just in case you have any issues down the line. For the most part, you really can\u0026#39;t go wrong here. The 8BitDo Pro 2 really does have it all at a price that can\u0026#39;t be ignored. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eJust be sure to grab it at this price while you can because supplies are limited.
