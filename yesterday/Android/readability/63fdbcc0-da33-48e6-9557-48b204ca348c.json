The benchmark gives us an idea of what to expect, performance-wise, from the SoC that was meant to be in the Galaxy S25 family but ended up being replaced with the Snapdragon 8 Elite due to yield issues. Let's just outright say it: it's definitely not up there with the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 SM-F766U with Exynos 2500 runs on Geekbench.Specificationsüî≥ Exynos 25001 Core @ 3.30 GHz2 Cores @ 2.75 GHz5 Cores @ 2.36 GHz2 Cores @ 1.80 GHzüéÆ Samsung Xclipse 950 GPUüç≠ Android 16- 12GB RAMScoresSingle-core: 2012Multi-core: 7563‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/SpOu7Fl7N4‚Äî Abhishek Yadav (@yabhishekhd) May 26, 2025 The Flip7 prototype managed a 2,012 single-core score and a 7,563 multi-core score, which is more in line with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 than its successor. And when we take a look at the CPU configuration, it starts to make sense - this chip has a ten-core CPU, with one Cortex-X925 core clocked at up to 3.3 GHz, two Cortex-A725 cores clocked at up to 2.75 GHz, five Cortex-A725 cores clocked at up to 2.36 GHz, and two Cortex-A520 cores clocked at up to 1.8 GHz. The clocks are much lower on this chip than on its competitors from Qualcomm, MediaTek, and even Xiaomi. We're not sure whether that's a specific setup for this device, given how it's a foldable and won't be great at heat dissipation, or if this is the standard Exynos 2500 configuration. Anyway, the Flip7 will launch running Android 16 with One UI 8 on top, and will have 12GB of RAM, according to the Geekbench database. It's expected to be introduced in early July alongside the Galaxy Z Fold7.",
