There are very few names that I would consider to be comparable to Anker when it comes to high-quality and reliable charging accessories. Anker's build quality is solid, its designs are fresh and modern, and the actual charging performance is up there—the company never hesitates to throw those high wattages out at us. At CES 2025 in Las Vegas, Anker has decided to unveil a bunch of new products, but the two that caught my eye are the new 140W charger with four ports and a 25,000mAh power bank that can charge your devices with a total output of 165W. I like the sound of that. Let's dive into them. Anker Launches Two New Charging Accessories for All of Your Mobile Devices In case you somehow couldn't tell, I am a big fan of Anker and the quality of their products. To me, in this modern age, it is a pretty much a no-brainer that if you're get well-built charging accessories at a sensible price, Anker is exactly where you should be. Fortunately, that is not close to changing, and the company's new devices, showcased at CES 2025, are testament to that. Anker's New Power Bank Comes with a Display, Four Ports, and Massive Capacity Image: Anker Our phones do everything for us these days, so it isn't ridiculous to say that a battery that dies unexpectedly can derail your entire day. You can take your charger around with you, but you won't always find a socket to plug it into, and that's why power banks exist. Power banks can be simple, we all know that, but Anker doesn't like simple. Anker's new power bank comes with a huge 25,000mAh capacity, which gives your phone several full charges and helps keep your other devices juiced up too. Despite its capacity, it is still TSA-approved for air travel. It has three USB-C ports, one USB-A port, and a built-in and retractable USB-C cable. Each USB-C port can charge at up to 100W and in total, the power bank can deliver 165W of power spread across multiple devices. Image: Anker Oh, and I can't forget to talk about the color display that it has. If you're the kind of guy who likes to track charging specs like the total output, the output per port, the power bank's temperature, and how long it might take to recharge, the screen will give you insight into all of those categories. The power bank will set you back $99.99, which is a lot of value for that price. This 140W Anker Charger Will Juice Up All Your Devices Simultaneously If you're like me, you don't use a power bank that often—instead, you prefer to keep things at 100% as much as you can. If that's the case, you need a charger, and a good one at that. With Anker's new four-port charger, you can charge your phone, smartwatch, earbuds, and anything else you might have, all at the same time. The charger has three USB-C ports and one USB-A port, and across those four, it can deliver up to 140W watts at once. That's a lot of juice. And this one has a display too, because why not. You can check out the total power output from the charger as well as the power output per port. Anker's new charger will set you back $89.99, but for a charger that can juice up your phone, laptop, and more, at the same time, that's not bad. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
