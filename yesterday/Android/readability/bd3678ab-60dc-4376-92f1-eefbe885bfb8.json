  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Carriers offering freebies is nothing new — T-Mobile was recently seen giving away a free year of DashPass to its customers. But if you're a Verizon customer, you might want to act fast, as the company is giving out free Amazon gift cards. Earlier today, Verizon announced an overhaul of its customer support system, integrating AI across the entire vertical. To celebrate, it seems the company is giving away free Amazon gift cards worth $5 and $20. Related To claim the offer, head to the new My Verizon app. In the app, go to the \"Me\" section, then to \"myAccess\", and under that select \"My savings \u0026 benefits.\" In the \"Featured Rewards\" section, you should see a banner for a free Amazon gift card. Tap it to claim your gift card. Once claimed, go back to the \"myAccess\" page and then to \"Claimed deals and more\" to find your gift card. You can redeem it directly from there by hitting the Redeem button, or you can manually redeem it by going to Amazon's website or app. You can snag a free Amazon gift card from Verizon right now The page notes that gift cards are available for a limited time or until supplies run out. According to some Reddit users, the $20 gift cards are already gone, but $5 gift cards are still being claimed. $5 might not sound like much, but free money is free, especially with Prime Day coming up, where you can stack this with already discounted deals. Verizon hasn't been known for freebies like T-Mobile, which runs the T-Mobile Tuesdays program, offering weekly perks and discounts. But this could be a start. The company seems to be trying to retain customers with the new myAccess perks, especially since it's been losing a lot of users this year.",
