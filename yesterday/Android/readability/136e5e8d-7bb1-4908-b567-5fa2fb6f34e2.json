everything that you can throw at it. It has six USB ports in total, with four USB-C and two USB-A. The USB-C port can support a maximum of 100W, and the charger in total can output 200W. This is great if you need to charge multiple devices at once. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to fantastic charging capabilities, you also get plenty of safety features as well, with Anker\u0026#39;s ActiveShield 3.0 system that monitors charging temperatures to ensure that your devices don\u0026#39;t get damaged. Perhaps best of all is that Anker includes a 24-month warranty with this charging station, just in case you need support later on down the line. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOverall, not a bad charger to go with if you need to charge lots of devices at once. This charger is built to handle laptops, tablets, smartphones, accessories, and more. Get it now at its discounted price while you can because this deal won\u0026#39;t be around for long.
