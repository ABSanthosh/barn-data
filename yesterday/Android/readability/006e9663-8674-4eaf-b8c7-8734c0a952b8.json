These have both speakers and microphones. This means you can listen to your music, make or take calls, and more, all hands-free.Of course, you will also get direct access to Alexa and all its capabilities. You can use the digital assistant to request music, check on the weather, ask for any random information, solve math problems, and even control your smart home devices.
