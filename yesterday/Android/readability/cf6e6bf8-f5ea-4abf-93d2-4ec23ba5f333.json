  "text": "Qualcomm recently announced its latest flagship chipset. This comes in the form of the Snapdragon 8 Elite, the successor to this year’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. Qualcomm already gave us a bunch of numbers on how much better performance and energy efficiency is, but these Snapdragon 8 Elite benchmarks should give us a better idea. One of the things to note about the new Snapdragon 8 Elite is that it is the first Qualcomm Snapdragon mobile chipset to feature the use of the new custom Oryon cores. Prior to this, Qualcomm licensed the Kryo cores from Arm, but the new chipset uses custom cores instead, which should give Qualcomm more freedom to get the chips to do what it wants. But it also begs the question, how much better are these new cores? According to Qualcomm, the  Snapdragon 8 Elite on benchmarking platforms such as Geekbench should give us a score of around 3,221 for single-core performance, and 10,426 for multi-core performance. Assuming these numbers are accurate, the Snapdragon 8 Elite blows its predecessor out of the water. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 managed a single-core score of 2,193 and a multi-core score of 7,304. The differences are staggering! Looking at other benchmarking platforms like AnTuTu, the Snapdragon 8 Elite is predicted to score about 3,014,075 points. This is versus the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which depending on the handset in question, seems to range from around 1.7 million and going up to a max of around 2.2 million. Basically it doesn’t even come close. Keep in mind that these benchmark scores don’t necessarily represent real-life performance. There are many other factors to consider, but it looks like the new chipset is definitely going to be a massive upgrade. A graphic novelist wannabe. Amateur chef. Mechanical keyboard enthusiast.
