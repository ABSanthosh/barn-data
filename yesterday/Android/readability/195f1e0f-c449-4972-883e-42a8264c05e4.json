All it takes is your Chromebook or Android phone, a quick prompt, and, optionally, a photo upload. These are popular image styles to try with ChatGPT. Related 10 Turn your portraits into cartoon images Transform photos into cartoon images with big eyes and bold colors. Upload a selfie (or any portrait) to ChatGPT and prompt it with the following: Turn my photo into a cartoon avatar with a bright smile and comic-style shading. Use it to make your profile picture stand out. You can also turn group photos into custom stickers or convert a family picture into a fun postcard. 9 Use anime style to transform into a Ghibli-inspired hero Turn your pictures into an anime-style character with sparkly eyes, dynamic hair, and that iconic Japanese charm. Whether you want the soft, dreamy style of Studio Ghibli or the bold lines of manga, ChatGPT delivers. The Studio Ghibli-inspired art style has been going viral since ChatGPT launched the new generative AI. Upload a photo and describe the look you want. For example: Redraw the image as an anime character with a Ghibli-style hand-painted background and big expressive eyes. Or start with a blank canvas: Generate a teenage anime hero with spiky blue hair and a city skyline behind him. Design a fresh avatar for your social profiles or gaming accounts. Print your anime self on a custom phone case or T-shirt and live out your Naruto or Totoro fantasies. Related 8 Celebrate your pet's personality in creative styles Reimagine your pet in unexpected styles. Turn them into a regal oil painting, a cartoon character, or a costumed icon. Upload a photo and add this prompt: Paint my dog in the style of a Renaissance portrait, wearing royal attire and a serious expression. Or: Turn this photo of my cat into a Disney-style cartoon. Pet lovers can use these portraits to decorate their homes. They also make great gifts or greeting cards, like a birthday card featuring a friend's puppy piloting a spaceship. It's a fun, personal way to celebrate your companions. 7 Use superhero makeover to turn your team into a comic squad ChatGPT can draw you in a comic art style or edit your photo to add superhero elements. There are two ways to try it: Generate a comic book-style illustration of a superhero with comic book shading. Add a photo if you want your face on the character, or describe your features: Put a superhero cape on me in this photo and add a dramatic sky background with lightning. Kids love seeing themselves as comic book characters on birthday invites. Even the office can join in. Turn your team into The Avengers for a presentation slide. Anyone can be a superhero for a day. 6 Design DIY cards and stickers for birthdays, invites, or journals ChatGPT can add basic text to illustrations and design birthday cards, invitation backgrounds, or sticker designs. Describe what you want. For example: Generate a cheerful birthday card with a cute cupcake character and the text 'Happy Birthday, Sam!' in fun lettering. For a sticker: Generate a round sticker of a smiling Earth wearing sunglasses with the text 'Stay Cool' around it. Text placement can sometimes be tricky, so you may need to try a few times. Use it for quick custom e-cards, hobby logos, or last-minute party invites. If you scrapbook or journal, design unique stickers with personal jokes or themed visuals. DIY design is effortless when you can describe what you want. Related What is Bing Image Creator? Discover Bing Image Creator's AI power, turning your words into beautiful visuals 5 Turn your ideas into cinematic posters Turn your ideas into movie posters or scenes from a film. ChatGPT adds Hollywood charm, dynamic angles, and bold typography. Describe a movie poster featuring anyone you want, and ChatGPT creates the poster. Start with a title or concept and list the key elements. For example: Generate a movie poster for a comedy called 'The Office Pets,' starring a dog in a tie and a cat with a briefcase, with skyscrapers in the background and a funny tagline. Or use your photo: Take my photo and make it look like an action movie poster with explosions behind me and the title 'My Life: The Movie' at the bottom. Be specific about the style. Action, drama, or whatever suits the concept. This works great for social media. Who wouldn't tap a post resembling a blockbuster featuring their friend group? 4 Reimagine your photos as Van Gogh or da Vinci creations ChatGPT remakes your photos into artworks inspired by classic masters. Think selfie in Van Gogh's swirly brushstrokes or your portrait reimagined as the Mona Lisa. Upload a photo and specify the artist or style: Generate this portrait in the style of Van Gogh's Starry Night, with bold strokes and a starry background. Or: Make my living room look like a watercolor by Monet. You can also go with: Turn this photo of my dog into a Renaissance oil painting in Leonardo da Vinci's style. ChatGPT can mimic a range of styles, particularly those of historical artists. Try posting a side-by-side of your original photo and the classic art version, and yes, your cat as a baroque noble is fair game. 3 Give your selfie a retro twist with the time machine filter From Victorian portraits to 1970s Polaroids, ChatGPT can make any photo look vintage. ChatGPT replicates each era's visual quirks through scratches, sepia tones, and black-and-white grain. Pick a decade or style and describe it: Make this photo look like a 1920s silent film still—grainy black-and-white with high contrast. Or: Give my picture a 90s disposable camera feel, with faded colors and a timestamp in the corner. You can also generate scenes from the past: A sepia-toned photo of a bustling city street in 1890. Turn a photo of you with a smartphone into something that looks 50 years old (perfect for a #ThrowbackThursday post). 2 Pixel art style gives your photos a retro video game look This style transforms photos or ideas into old-school pixel art, inspired by classic games from the 80s and 90s. Expect the chunky pixels, limited color palettes, and retro charm of an NES or SNES game. Upload a simple photo and prompt: Turn this picture of my dog into pixel art, like a character from a retro video game. Or generate a scene: 8-bit pixel art of a knight fighting a dragon in a castle courtyard. Choose a blocky 8-bit or a detailed 16-bit. Create actual game assets or decorate their spaces with pixelated portraits. Turn your family into a \"Family RPG\" lineup with a healer, warrior, and mage. It's also perfect for retro-styled Twitch or Discord avatars. Related 1 Explore neon skylines and space stations with sci-fi style Fast-forward to the year 3000 and bring your sci-fi visions to life. Think neon-lit skyscrapers, flying cars, cyberpunk alleyways, or intergalactic architecture. If you're a fan of Blade Runner or Star Wars, this style lets you create tech-filled, awe-inspiring scenes with ChatGPT. Describe a futuristic setting: A sprawling cyberpunk city at night, with neon Japanese signs, flying vehicles, and rain-slick streets. Or: A Mars colony with domed habitats under a pink sky, astronauts walking around. The more details you include, the better the result. Use these visuals as backgrounds for videos, presentations, or social posts. ChatGPT visualizes your imagined worlds, whether you're building a game or writing a story. AI can be fun when you use it to create, not just work AI isn't only for grinding through tasks or boosting productivity. Sometimes, it's about having fun and getting creative. Step away from the serious stuff, explore the playful side of AI, and let your imagination take over.",
