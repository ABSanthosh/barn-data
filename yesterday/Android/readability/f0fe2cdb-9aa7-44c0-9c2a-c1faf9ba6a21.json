  "text": "Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Google's latest Gemini feature allows users to ask contextual questions about specific locations in Google Maps. The Ask about place chip in Gemini integrates with Google Maps, providing information about businesses and restaurants. While still in early stages, the integration works well for specific locations, with potential for more functionality as it develops. Google's newest Gemini feature ties directly into Google Maps. It gives users the ability to ask contextual questions about specific places, such as \"Does this store carry milk?\" Related Google Maps vs. Waze Which navigation app is better for you? The feature appears as a new Ask about place chip when you launch Gemini from within Google Maps (via Android Authority). You can query Gemini for information about restaurants, businesses, tourist traps, etc. At least, that is the idea, although the new feature is not yet available to everyone. How the Ask about place integration works You can invoke Gemini directly in Google Maps by tapping on a place and then summoning Gemini on your device like you normally would. When the Gemini input bubble opens at the bottom of your screen, you will see a chip labeled 'Ask about place.' Tapping it passes a Maps URL to Gemini, and it will understand what you're referring to. Gemini will then answer questions like how to get there, what's nearby, and menu details for restaurants. We gave it a try and found the integration works best with specific businesses and locations. Broad queries about neighborhoods or entire cities don't work. We also found it fell back on Google Search for some questions, especially more nuanced queries. However, it works surprisingly well most of the time. My own test correctly identified that my local Mediterranean restaurant serves souvlaki. It also gave me a list of other menu items from the same place. It's still early but shows promise This Ask about place feature is still in an early rollout phase and may not be available across all accounts. Gemini may fail to load Maps context, or the chip may not even appear. We don't know if Gemini Advanced is required for full functionality, although it seems as if it isn't. My own tests worked, and I am not a Gemini Advanced subscriber. You will need the Google app version 16.10.40, Gemini app version 1.0.686588308, and Google Maps version 25.12.01. We will continue monitoring this as it develops into something incredibly useful.",

Broad queries about neighborhoods or entire cities don\u0026#39;t work. We also found it fell back on Google Search for some questions, especially more nuanced queries.
