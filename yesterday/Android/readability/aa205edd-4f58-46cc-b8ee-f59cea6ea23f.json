If you’re wondering if that’s true, you’ll have to wait a little bit longer because, according to tipster Max Jambor, the tri-fold Samsung phone will launch at a date later than we expected. Samsung is planning on launching the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 phones later this year. Based on the launch of the Fold 6 and Flip 6, we’re assuming it will take place towards the middle of 2025. We’re also under the assumption that the tri-fold phone will launch alongside the new Fold and Flip phones. But that is no longer the case. According to the tipster, Samsung will launch its tri-fold phone at a later date. This means that the handset won’t be unveiled alongside the new Fold 7 and Flip 7 phones. The tipster does not provide us with a date except to say “at a later point in time.” This delay is disappointing for those eager to see Samsung’s next big innovation. But maybe we should have seen it coming—Samsung has been shifting its launch strategy for a while now. Take, for example, the Galaxy Z Fold FE. The handset was launched after the release of the Fold 6 and Flip 6 models. This year, we have the Galaxy S25 Edge. The handset was not announced together with the Galaxy S25 models. So, Samsung opting to reveal its tri-fold phone separate from its main foldable lineup feels par for the course. However, why is the company going with this strategy? Maybe Samsung isn’t confident that its tri-fold phone will sell, so they don’t want to distract customers from its main foldables. On the flip side, maybe Samsung thinks that this phone is so revolutionary it deserves an event of its own. Size matters—but maybe timing does too. Whether Samsung is playing it safe or building hype, we’ll have to wait a little longer to find out if the future of foldables is really bigger and better. A graphic novelist wannabe. Amateur chef.
