READ: Gemini video summarization in Drive now lets you ask questions about any video With that in mind, google recently announced the arrival of a new update that integrates Gemini-powered summarization for Gmail. The feature previously required users to input a manual prompt, although Google says that it will now appear by default at the top of relevant email conversations. Google adds that the feature will generate summaries for “longer email threads or messages with several replies,” while highlighting key points and updating automatically as new responses come in. While the feature will be enabled by default for English-language emails, users can still manually request a summary for any email by tapping the “Summarize this email” chip. The rollout will take up to around two weeks, although it should be mentioned that the new feature is currently exclusive to Google Workspace subscribers, Google One AI Premium subscribers, and customers with Gemini Education/Gemini Education Premium.
