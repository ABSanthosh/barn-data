I went to my first-ever concert yesterday, and while enjoying the music, the tech guy in me couldn't help but notice something rather odd. Among all the phones in front of me that were lifted up to record the performance, I probably noticed at least 10 phones with green lines racing down their screens. The green line problem is far from rare, and while I've never experienced it before, it's one of the more annoying smartphone display problems that you might need to contend with. However, OnePlus believes that you won't have to deal with that with them, going as far as making the bold offer of a lifetime warranty for that problem. OnePlus Seems Very Confident That It Has Cracked The Code For Displays Image: OnePlus It's still exclusive to China for now, but according to DisplayMate, the screen for the OnePlus 13 is so good that they had to create an entirely new ranking for it. Apparently, it's not just the visual quality of the screen that has improved. It also seems like OnePlus has made sure that the actual build quality of that display is on the high end as well. OnePlus is doing a whole lot to make sure that its screens are “built different” from the competition. Its AMOLED screens are going to have a new “Enhanced Edge Bonding Layer” which uses a “PVX edge-sealing material”. I wish I understood exactly what all of that meant, but from what I understand, it will make for a stronger barrier against moisture and oxygen and make the screens more resistant to extreme temperatures. Image: OnePlus They've also improved their quality control processes, with a battery of more than 180 tests to make sure your phone's screen can handle every single real-world condition it might be put through. Notable is the Double 85 test, which makes sure that the screen can withstand 85°C heat and 85% humidity for extended periods. That Confidence Has Led The OEM To Provide A Lifetime Warranty For Screen Issues And it seems that OnePlus isn't just fluffing its feathers with all that talk. It really means it, which explains why it is offering a lifetime warranty (absolutely unprecedented) on “green line-related issues”. That has been an issue for a lot of devices that use AMOLED screens, but OnePlus clearly feels like it must have cracked the code. Image: OnePlus What makes this even more exceptional is that even though its anti-green line stance might not have existed with its older devices, it is making that warranty active on all of its devices, whether you're talking about smartphones or tablets, or whether you're talking about old or new devices. And no, it doesn't even matter if your old phone is out of its warranty period already. OnePlus will be replacing the screen anyway. Any company that offers a lifetime warranty on any of its products is publicly stating its confidence in the quality of that product. For OnePlus to offer a lifetime warranty against green lines, it could finally mark the last time we worry about that problem. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
