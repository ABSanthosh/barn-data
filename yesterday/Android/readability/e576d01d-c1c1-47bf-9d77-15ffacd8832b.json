It was about six weeks ago that Android 15 was pushed to AOSP, giving OEMs the chance to start working on their own takes on the new OS. It took Vivo less than a month to get there, marking itself as first in line. However, since then, Google and Motorola have joined the squad, and now another major manufacturer has made its intentions known. OnePlus will be a part of the exclusive club before the month ends when it brings out OxygenOS 15. On October 24th, the Chinese manufacturer will be showing off its shiniest new OS, with a major focus on speed and fluidity. OnePlus' OxygenOS 15, Based On Android 15, Will Be Officially Launched On October 24th Image: Peter Holden/Talk Android Manufacturers who can get their versions of Android 15 released within October have the right to make a big deal about it. Google only pushed its own version out a few days ago, and if you can be neck-and-neck with Google itself, you should be proud. OnePlus is about to join the esteemed band of OEMs as it has announced that it'll be announcing OxygenOS 15 on October 24th. The company isn't just going to start rolling it out on that date, but it's going to have an online event to accompany it, likely to publicize every new aspect of OxygenOS 15. You can tune in at 3:30 PM GMT on October 24th. At the moment, it's not clear how many devices will be getting the update right away, but we can all make an educated guess and say that the OnePlus 12 series and the OnePlus Open will be on that list. The New Operating System Will Have A Major Focus On Speed, As Well As AI Image: Peter Holden/Talk Android OnePlus has always been very focused on the fluidity and speed of its operating system and that doesn't change this year either. The company reemphasizes how much it wants to provide a “Fast \u0026 Smooth” experience and says it has included an “industry-leading software algorithm technology”. Well, I'm looking forward to seeing that fluidity put to the test. It also seems that those who have been seeking something of a UI refresh will be getting their prayers answered. OnePlus has said it's going to bring a unique visual style with some features inspired and tweaked by the feedback from OnePlus community members. And of course, AI is always going to be an honored guest at the party. OnePlus has said that its latest AI features will be included in the new operating system. They're designed to “maximize productivity and creativity”, but that's all that we really know about them, so we're going to have to just wait until October 24th (just a week away) before we get any additional insight regarding what we can expect. The Biggest Android Manufacturer Is Nowhere To Be Seen Image: Samsung Other manufacturers have made it a priority to get their versions of Android 15 on the phones in the hands of their consumers, and they're doing a pretty good job of that so far. However, Samsung, the biggest Android manufacturer, isn't going to be rolling out a release version of One UI 7, based on Android 15, until early next year. That's tardy. To be fair though, as a Samsung user, I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they aren't trying to rush perfection. That's fair if that's the case. However, there will be very high expectations for One UI 7 and I hope that the company is able to meet them. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
