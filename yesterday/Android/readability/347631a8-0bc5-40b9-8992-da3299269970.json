  "text": "Technology has made our lives easier in various ways. One is the streamlined “Sign in or up with Google” option button. Like magic, this method offers a convenient way to join sites without entering an email address and a unique password. This is especially important in today’s digital era, where managing emails and passwords for various sites can be tricky, especially when we use multiple devices like phones, tablets, and Chromebooks. The technology leverages the SSO (Single Sign On) feature to help you sign in to sites and apps seamlessly. You can utilize a single email for various accounts, removing the need to craft or remember different usernames and passwords for the platforms. When you tap the “Sign in with Google” button on a third-party site, you allow the platform to verify your identity and then use this data to log in. While this feature’s main selling point is convenience, it comes at a cost. In this guide, I explore the potential risks of signing in with Google. Related 5 I want complete control over my accounts on various platforms Manage accounts independently Source: Amazon Instead of allowing Google and third-party platforms to control my accounts, I prefer doing it independently. Although this might seem like an uphill task, as it means a few more usernames and passwords to memorize, it gives me total control over my accounts. If you find it hard to keep track of passwords, use a reliable password manager. The best options have secure vaults that store your passwords and help you create better passwords. However, independent login credentials for various platforms allow me to reset passwords separately, review and manage security settings on sites individually, and keep everything organized. 4 Creates cold comfort Not all platforms you log in to through your Google account are secure Source: Soundtrap Signing in with Google’s SSO feature offers solid security features as it relies on two-factor authentication, different identity providers (IdPs), and robust protocols to control authentication on different services and domains. While this is a good thing, as it assures users of their privacy and security, it is not usually the case. The application or site where you use the SSO feature to sign in might have weaknesses that could be exploited to steal your data. To be on the safe side, I stopped using the feature as it means depending heavily on Google’s security undertakings without reviewing the security of third-party platforms. 3 I want to reduce Google’s impact on my life Limit Google’s tracking and profiling Source: Google If you use any Google service, such as Gmail or YouTube, the tech giant may track your online activities. If you sign in via its SSO feature, you give the platform more control over your digital life. Google may collect your information from the sites and applications you access. It uses sophisticated technologies to profile and track your activities in the digital space. This includes what you view, what you do, and the pages you visit. Based on this information, Google may craft a detailed profile of your demographics, preferences, and interests. The profile may also include your real age, purchasing habits, hobbies, location, and gender. This is important for advertising as it can be used to serve you targeted ads. While nothing is wrong with this, it raises concerns about how much Google or other companies know about you and whether they use it sensibly. Additionally, using the sign-in feature centralizes your online profile within one entity. 2 It’s a data giveaway The fewer platforms with my information, the safer I feel Lucas Gouveia/Android Police Another drawback of using “Sign in with Google” to access various platforms is privacy concerns. You are technically giving the tech giant authority to access and share your data with the services you want to use. This data includes your photos, email address, friends list, and name, sometimes without you realizing it. That’s why it is important to read the privacy policy before you sign up for anything or tap the “Continue with Google” button. While some platforms may require minimal data, others ask for more, which is a risk to your privacy. At a glance, this may seem harmless. But do you know how these third-party apps use your data? What if their site is breached and your sensitive data is exposed? For example, if you sign up on a travel site using a Google account that you used to sign up on Facebook, the travel platform can access your friends to search for reviews and experiences. An e-commerce site or online taxi service like Uber can use your Google ID to access your Google Wallet in some cases, which you may not be willing to share. Additionally, various businesses face challenges when an employee uses their official Gmail account to sign in to platforms. This can lead to accidental sharing of sensitive information such as contacts, task lists, and calendars. So, before you continue, keep in mind that “Sign Up with Google” is not just a convenient shortcut. It could mean handing over your sensitive data to malicious actors. That’s why limiting who can access my Gmail account is a no-brainer. Related 1 If my account is breached One compromise could put all my accounts at risk Source: play.google.com and Markus Spiske - Pexels Most sites that use the “Sign up with Google” feature may not be as secure as Google. This puts your data, including name, age, email address, and pictures, at risk if there is a breach or if it is accessed by malicious actors. This is especially true if you use the same Gmail account to access several platforms. If the account is compromised, it becomes a loophole that attackers can use to steal your data on the compromised platform and all associated accounts. For example, if your Google account is hacked, cybercriminals usually check linked apps under the settings section. They can use the data to access the accounts linked to the email. Additionally, using Google’s SSO feature limits access to accounts. With any account you create or sign up for using your Gmail account, you are technically connecting that account to your Google account. If your Google account is compromised or you lose access to it, the platforms you created using the email could be at risk. To avoid such inconveniences, I avoid using SSO services. Signing in with Google’s benefits comes with trade-offs At face value, Google’s SSO feature may seem an obvious choice. After all, it streamlines the login process, is convenient, has better security with two-factor authentication, and you have one less password to memorize. However, after using the feature for over half a decade, I realize it comes with some risks that I am not willing to take. I stopped using this method, and I believe you should, too. Instead, take the time to craft unique usernames and strong passwords for each platform you sign up for. If this does not cut it, consider a reliable password manager to help you create and store login credentials. This will give you peace of mind that your accounts on various sites are secure and that your personal data is protected.",

any Google service, such as Gmail or YouTube, the tech giant may track your online activities. If you sign in via its SSO feature, you give the platform more control over your digital life. Google may collect your information from the sites and applications you access. It uses sophisticated technologies to profile and track your activities in the digital space. This includes what you view, what you do, and the pages you visit.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eBased on this information, Google may craft a detailed profile of your demographics, preferences, and interests. The profile may also include your real age, purchasing habits, hobbies, location, and gender. This is important for advertising as it can be used to serve you targeted ads. While nothing is wrong with this, it raises concerns about how much Google or other companies know about you and whether they use it sensibly.

\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e Another drawback of using “Sign in with Google” to access various platforms is privacy concerns. You are technically giving the tech giant authority to access and share your data with the services you want to use. This data includes your photos, email address, friends list, and name, sometimes without you realizing it. That’s why it is important to read the privacy policy before you sign up for anything or tap the “Continue with Google” button.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhile some platforms may require minimal data, others ask for more, which is a risk to your privacy. At a glance, this may seem harmless. But do you know how these third-party apps use your data? What if their site is breached and your sensitive data is exposed?\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFor example, if you sign up on a travel site using a Google account that you used to sign up on Facebook, the travel platform can access your friends to search for reviews and experiences. An e-commerce site or online taxi service like Uber can use your Google ID to access your Google Wallet in some cases, which you may not be willing to share. Additionally, various businesses face challenges when an employee uses their official Gmail account to sign in to platforms. This can lead to accidental sharing of sensitive information such as contacts, task lists, and calendars.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSo, before you continue, keep in mind that “Sign Up with Google” is not just a convenient shortcut. It could mean handing over your sensitive data to malicious actors. That’s why limiting who can access my Gmail account is a no-brainer.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n

\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e Most sites that use the “Sign up with Google” feature may not be as secure as Google. This puts your data, including name, age, email address, and pictures, at risk if there is a breach or if it is accessed by malicious actors. This is especially true if you use the same Gmail account to access several platforms. If the \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/ways-to-tell-phone-hacked/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eaccount is compromised\u003c/a\u003e, it becomes a loophole that attackers can use to steal your data on the compromised platform and all associated accounts.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFor example, if your Google account is hacked, cybercriminals usually check linked apps under the settings section. They can use the data to access the accounts linked to the email. Additionally, using Google’s SSO feature limits access to accounts.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWith any account you create or sign up for using your Gmail account, you are technically connecting that account to your Google account. If your Google account is compromised or you lose access to it, the platforms you created using the email could be at risk. To avoid such inconveniences, I avoid using SSO services.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch3 id=\"signing-in-with-google-rsquo-s-benefits-comes-with-trade-offs\"\u003e\n            Signing in with Google’s benefits comes with trade-offs\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt face value, Google’s SSO feature may seem an obvious choice. After all, it streamlines the login process, is convenient, has better security with two-factor authentication, and you have one less password to memorize. However, after using the feature for over half a decade, I realize it comes with some risks that I am not willing to take.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eI stopped using this method, and I believe you should, too. Instead, take the time to craft unique usernames and strong passwords for each platform you sign up for. If this does not cut it, consider \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/password-managers-personally-recommend/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea reliable password manager\u003c/a\u003e to help you create and store login credentials. This will give you peace of mind that your accounts on various sites are secure and that your personal data is protected.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
