When the company revealed the early version of Gemini 2.5 Pro on March 25, it was exclusive to Gemini Advanced subscribers. That exclusivity period didn't last long, as Google extended its best experimental model to free users by Saturday, March 29.\"Gemini 2.5 Pro is taking off,\" the company wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on the Gemini app account. \"The team is sprinting, TPUs are running hot, and we want to get our most intelligent model into more peopleâ€™s hands asap.
