If you’re looking for a new phone, watch and/or TWS buds, here are the best offers we found for Samsung and Google devices. The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is cheaper than it was last week, at least for the 512GB model, which has a better discount – that puts it only $70 over the 256GB model. You can pair it with a Samsung Galaxy Watch7, both the Bluetooth and 4G LTE versions are $75 off. The watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, so we’ve linked both below. For the buds, Amazon is selling the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro with a $60 discount and a $20 gift card. If the S24 Ultra is over your budget, have a look at the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE – its cameras are no match for the Ultra, but the FE costs half as much. Unusually for the US, this is with an Exynos chipset, but the 2400e proved to be a solid performer in this price class. You can go even lower with the Samsung Galaxy A35, which is down to $300 at the moment. Unlike the FE (or any S-series phone, for that matter), the A35 has a microSD slot for cheap and easy storage expansion. We flip over to the Google side of Android and Best Buy. The Google Pixel 9 series is $150 off across the board (except for the foldable, see below) and you can further reduce the price by up to $650 if you trade in an old device. We have a series of comparison articles to help you decide between the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL and between the Pixel 9 Pro XL and Galaxy S24 Ultra. The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is discounted by $300 (it needs it more than its rigid siblings) and you can still do a trade-in. The Google Pixel Watch 3 is also available in Bluetooth and 4G LTE and two sizes as well – 41mm and 45mm. Most functions on the Pixel Watch will work with a non-Pixel phone too (including ECG, which isn’t the case with the Galaxy Watch). For the headphones, there are the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 – they are comfortable, sound great and don’t have pesky stems. We may get a commission from qualifying sales.",
