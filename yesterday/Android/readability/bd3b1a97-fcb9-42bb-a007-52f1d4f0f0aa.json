Movie streaming giant Netflix has rolled out a new feature called Moments on the mobile app. If you’re watching something and there’s a part you love, just tap a button to save that exact scene as a clip. Right now, it’s only on iPhones, but Android users should get it soon. The clips you save go into the My Netflix tab so that you can jump back to your favorite moments anytime. You can also share them directly on social media or send them privately to friends.  Capture movie scenes legally with Netflix Moments Netflix has given us a great alternative to a feature many of us needed. Moments is their answer to the fact that they don’t allow traditional screenshots or screen recordings. Instead, with this new feature, they’re giving you a legitimate way to save and share scenes you love without breaking any rules.  When next you open the Netflix app, you may see the new icon beside your playback controls. You can use it to bookmark Wednesday Addams' (Jenna Ortega) creepy and iconic dance scene or capture Simon (Regé-Jean Page) dramatically yelling “I burn for you!” at Daphne (Phoebe Dynevor) in Bridgerton. You'll have an excuse to discuss them on WhatsApp, Instagram, and other social apps. Image: Netflix Also, when you tap on Moments scenes, the app picks up right where you left off. So you can rewatch them without having to scan through the episode or app again. Since the feature is still rolling out globally, it may take a while to appear on your phone. So, be patient.  Saves Moments without consuming space Unlike downloads, Moments don't count towards your storage. Netflix lets you save as many as you want. But the actual number you can keep depends on how long the movie or episode is. The company's spokesperson, Dorian Rosenburg, told The Verge that there’s generally more than enough space for users to keep their favorite Moments without running into a limit. Netflix's exciting feature release coincides with its new marketing campaign, “It's So Good.” This campaign highlights memorable scenes from different shows and movies on the platform. It features appearances or endorsements from well-known personalities like Cardi B, Simone Biles, and Giancarlo Esposito. The campaign aims to engage viewers and encourage them to share their own favorite moments. All Netflix plans support Moments You can use Moments no matter which plan you’re on. In the USA, the streaming service currently offers the Standard with ads plan for $6.99 per month (availability may vary with some third-party providers), the Standard plan at $15.49 per month with an option to add extra member slots for $7.99 each, and the Premium plan at $22.99 per month, also allowing extra member slots for $7.99 each.  Image: Netflix As of July 2024, the Basic plan has been discontinued, but it remains available in other countries. If you didn't switch to a different plan before it ended, your subscription must have been canceled by now unless you subscribe to a new plan. If you don't want to upgrade, consider alternative streaming services that may offer value for less.  Irene is an experienced writer with four years in the Tech, E-commerce, and Food niches.
