The brand recently teased its upcoming smartphone launch, which will feature two new devices under the 10 series. The biggest (literal) highlights about the upcoming phones might be the fact that they’re set to come with large displays – we’re talking mini tablet territory here – with the Red Magic 10 Pro and 10 Pro+ featuring screen sizes that are almost seven inches in width. Meanwhile, the Red Magic 10 Ultra will come with a display that extends beyond seven inches. In addition to large displays, Red Magic says that its upcoming phones will pack a special edition of the Snapdragon 8 Elite, dubbed the 8 Elite “Extreme Edition.” Not much else was revealed however, so other details such as pricing and availability are a mystery at the moment.
