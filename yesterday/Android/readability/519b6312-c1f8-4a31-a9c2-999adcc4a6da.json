You probably pre-registered for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile back in March, hoping to dive into the action when it launched. A game that popular on computer brings an exciting opportunity to experience it mobile devices. The initial system requirements were discouraging enough for low-end users, and now a recent update will kill your dreams. Starting November 14, 2024, Warzone Mobile will require iOS 17 or Android 13 and a phone with a GPU capable of bindless texturing. This update introduces WZM's integration with Black Ops 6. If you’ve recently upgraded to a slightly newer phone, or were planning to play it on a future upgrade, it's probably time to say your goodbyes. It's game over for older phones on CoD Warzone Mobile Activision’s upcoming update to the Warzone Mobile game means that your device may no longer meet the game’s standards. Before now, you were good to go with Android 9 or higher, 3GB of RAM, and a Qualcomm Adreno 530 GPU or higher. On iPhones, you needed iOS 12 or higher, with at least 3GB of RAM and an Apple A9 chip or later.  Image: Activision The updated minimum specs for the game now require Android 13 or iOS 17 or higher, with a GPU capable of bindless texturing. Bindless texturing is a technique that lets a game’s graphics chip access tons of textures, or visual details, all at once without needing extra setup steps.  The minimum device specifications for Warzone Mobile needed to be increased for future updates and integrations with the Call of Duty franchise to meet our high standards of performance while providing a best-in-class gameplay experience. Activision Image Credit: Activision It's not your lucky moment as Activision has put together a list of unsupported devices, and it's a long one—around 98 pages, including plenty of Samsung's Galaxy phones. Even the Razer’s hybrid gaming Edge tablet released last year didn't make the cut. You get a consolation prize in the end If your device doesn’t meet the new Warzone Mobile requirements, you won’t be able to update the game after November 14, 2024. If you already have the current version 3.10 installed, keep playing it until around May 5, 2025 as long as you don’t uninstall it, and use any remaining points you've bought in-game.  You'll keep any progression, weapons, camos, and other content you unlocked before the update, and you can still unlock more items within the version. But you won’t be able to spend Arsenal Coins or Event Store currency anymore. Should you delete this version accidentally, you can't reinstall and play it again until you upgrade to a supported device.  Also, starting in Season 01 of the new update, progression, items, and content linked to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will only be accessible to those who meet the new minimum specs and update to the latest version. Image: Activision After May 5, the old version will go offline. On the bright side, Activision is making up for this drastic change by offering special rewards in their other game, Call of Duty: Mobile. Just log into CODM after November 14, 2024, with the same account you used for Warzone Mobile to claim them. Irene is an experienced writer with four years in the Tech, E-commerce, and Food niches.
