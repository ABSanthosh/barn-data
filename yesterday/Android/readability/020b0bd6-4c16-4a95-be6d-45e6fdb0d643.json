  "text": "The launch of Google’s Circle to Search feature was a pretty handy and innovative way to streamline image and general search queries on Android phones, and while the feature initially arrived for Google and Samsung devices, it has now been made available for more handsets from different manufacturers. As such, Nothing is the latest smartphone brand to bring over Circle to Search for its phones, which include the Nothing Phone 2, Phone 2a, and Phone 2a Plus. This follows the arrival of Android 15 for several Nothing Phone models, via Nothing OS 3. READ: Nothing OS 3 Finally Begins its Stable Roll-out The search feature is available on Nothing Phone 2 units with Nothing OS 3.0 and build number Pong-V3.0-241207-0124, while Phone 2a owners should have their devices updated to Pacman-V3.0-241210-2057. Circle to Search works by long-pressing either the navigation bar or home button, and drawing a literal circle on an object you’d like to search for online. In addition to Circle to Search, Nothing OS 3 packs some new changes to the user interface, as well as enhancements to security and stability, to name a few. Source: GSMArena",
