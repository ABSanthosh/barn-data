In fact, Xiaomi Group Partner and President Lu Weibing confirmed that the company will unveil a new phone during the Barcelona-based event. More specifically, the device in question is the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, which was revealed during a fan Q\u0026A video session. As MWC 2025 is scheduled for early March this year, it’s likely that the phone will first make its debut in Chinese markets in February, to be followed by a global launch. READ: The Xiaomi 15 Features a Familiar Look with Powerful Internals In terms of specs, it’s predicted that the phone will feature a 2K OLED display, a massive 6,000 mAh battery with 90W charging support, as well as Qualcomm’s trusty Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. Rumored camera specs include a Sony Lytia LYT-900 main camera, which is accompanied by a 50 MP Samsung ISOCELL JN5 ultrawide, a 50 MP close range telephoto, and a 200 MP periscope telephoto camera as well. In any case, it looks like the Xiaomi 15 Ultra is shaping up to be a rather-impressive camera smartphone.
