Even though 6G is the future, it is still very far from ending up in the hands of consumers like you and me. 5G is the present and every single mobile carrier wants to make sure that you never forget that—you can tell just by looking at all of their marketing. The word “5G” shows up everywhere. That's because 5G is very fast, and it can make our lives more convenient. The biggest problem with 5G has been its accessibility, whether you're talking about living in an area with good coverage or having a device that supports it. With Boost Mobile's new device though, it's hard to say accessibility is a problem. Boost Mobile Launches Its New Summit 5G Smartphone; A Budget Device With 5G Speed Image: Boost Mobile Even though Boost Mobile doesn't sit on a similarly-sized throne as the Big Three carriers in the US, they still offer exclusive smartphones like the others do. And now, they've just added a new one to the mix, in the form of the Boost Mobile Summit 5G. I'll tell you right now, what makes this device such a catch is its price. You get 5G support, which means 5G speeds, without paying through the nose for that privilege. Before anything else, let's talk about the specs that you get from the Summit 5G. First off, this is a budget device, and it does a good job adopting modern design trends like a flat frame and a mostly flat back panel, but you can obviously tell it isn't an premium phone. On the front side, it has a teardrop notch for the selfie camera and a big bezel under its 6.6-inch HD+ screen. Image: Boost Mobile On the back of the device is a 13MP camera with autofocus and a 2MP depth sensor. On the front is a 5MP selfie shooter, so don't expect too much. There's a very basic MediaTek MT6835V octa-core processor with a 2.2GHz clock speed, along with 64GB of storage, 4GB of RAM, and a 5,000mAh battery. Budget specs, as one might expect. The Summit 5G Will Only Set You Back $94.99 Image: Boost Mobile The specs aren't fantastic, but that's what you get when the major selling point is the price. In the case of the Summit 5G, buying it outright will only cost you $94.99, which for a smartphone, is considered affordable for most people. The best part is that the specs are good enough and you get 5G. There's little to complain about. But hey, if you're already a Boost customer who wants to upgrade to this device, you can get it for even less—only $19.99. I think $20 is affordable for literally everyone, making this 5G device as accessible as they come. Image: Boost Mobile It's hard to deny that this smartphone hits the perfect balance of affordability and performance, especially for people who have been looking for a cost-effective way to join the 5G party. And since Boost Mobile offers plans that start as low as $25 each month, it's going to be pretty easy to start enjoying the 5G life, at least until 6G shows up.
