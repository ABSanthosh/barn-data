  "text": "I was reflecting on what I learned about CSS Carousels recently. There’s a lot they can do right out of the box (and some things they don’t) once you define a scroll container and hide the overflow. Hey, isn’t there another fairly new CSS feature that works with scroll regions? Oh yes, that’s Scroll-Driven Animations. Shouldn’t that mean we can trigger an animation while scrolling through the items in a CSS carousel? Why yes, that’s exactly what it means. At least in Chrome at the time I’m playing with this: It’s as straightforward as you might expect: define your keyframes and apply them on the carousel items: @keyframes foo { from { height: 0; } to { height: 100%; font-size: calc(2vw + 1em); } } .carousel li { animation: foo linear both; animation-timeline: scroll(inline); } There are more clever ways to animate these things of course. But what’s interesting to me is that this demo now combines CSS Carousels with Scroll-Driven Animations. The only rub is that the demo also slaps CSS Scroll Snapping in there with smooth scrolling, which is effectively wiped out when applying the scroll animation. I thought I might work around that with a view() timeline instead. That certainly makes for a smoother animation that is applied to each carousel item as they scroll into view, but no dice on smooth scrolling.",
