I was invited to host the panel discussion with the speakers, including a couple of personal heroes of mine, Stéphanie Walter and Sarah Fossheim. But I was just as stoked to meet Kardo Ayoub who shared his deeply personal story as a designer with a major visual impairment. Smashing Meets Accessibility originally published on CSS-Tricks, which is part of the DigitalOcean family. You should get the newsletter.",

But I was just as stoked to meet Kardo Ayoub who shared his deeply personal story as a designer with a major visual impairment. I’ll drop the video here: I’ll be the first to admit that I had to hold back my emotions as Kardo detailed what led to his impairment, the shock that came of it, and how he has beaten the odds to not only be an effective designer, but a real leader in the industry. It’s well worth watching his full presentation, which is also available on YouTube alongside the full presentations from Stéphanie and Sarah. Direct Link →",
