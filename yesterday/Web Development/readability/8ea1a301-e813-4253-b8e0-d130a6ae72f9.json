  "text": "State of Devs 2025 survey results are out! While the survey isn’t directly related to the code part of what we do for work, I do love the focus Devographics took ever since its inception in 2020. And this year it brought us some rather interesting results through the attendance of 8,717 developers, lots of data, and even more useful insights that I think everyone can look up and learn from. I decided to look at the survey results with an analytical mindset, but wound up pouring my heart out because, well, I am a developer, and the entire survey affects me in a way. I have some personal opinions, it turns out. So, sit back, relax, and indulge me for a bit as we look at a few choice pieces of the survey. And it’s worth noting that this is only part one of the survey results. A second data dump will be published later and I’m interested to poke at those numbers, too. An opportunity to connect One thing I noticed from the Demographics section is how much tech connects us all. The majority of responses come from the U.S. (26%) but many other countries, including Italy, Germany, France, Estonia, Austria, South Africa and many more, account for the remaining 74%. I mean, I am working and communicating with you right now, all the way from Nigeria! Isn’t that beautiful, to be able to communicate with people around the world through this wonderful place we call CSS-Tricks? And into the bigger community of developers that keeps it so fun? I think this is a testament to how much we want to connect. More so, the State of Devs survey gives us an opportunity to express our pain points on issues surrounding our experiences, workplace environments, quality of health, and even what hobbies we have as developers. And while I say developers, the survey makes it clear it’s more than that. Behind anyone’s face is someone encountering life challenges. We’re all people and people are capable of pure emotion. We are all just human. It’s also one of the reasons I decided to open a Bluesky account: to connect with more developers. I think this survey offers insights into how much we care about ourselves in tech, and how eager we are to solve issues rarely talked about. And the fact that it’s global in nature illustrates how much in common we all have. More women participated this year From what I noticed, fewer women participated in the 2024 State of JavaScript and State of CSS fewer women (around 6%), while women represented a bigger share in this year’s State of Devs survey. I’d say 15% is still far too low to fairly “represent” an entire key segment of people, but it is certainly encouraging to see a greater slice in this particular survey. We need more women in this male-dominated industry. Experience over talent Contrary to popular opinion, personal performance does not usually equate to higher pay, and this is reflected in the results of this survey. It’s more like, the more experienced you are, the more you’re paid. But even that’s not the full story. If you’re new to the field, you still have to do some personal marketing, find and keep a mentor, and a whole bunch of stuff. Cassidy shares some nice insights on this in a video interview tracing her development career. You should check it out, especially if you’re just starting out. Notice that the average income for those with 10-14 of experience ($115,833) is on par with those with between 15-29 years of experience ($118,000) and not far from those with 30+ years ($120,401). Experience appears to influence income, but perhaps not to the extent you would think, or else we’d see a wider gap between those with 15 years versus those with more than double the service time. More than that, notice how income for the most experienced developers (30+ years) is larger on average but the range of how much they make is lower than than those with 10-29 years under their belts. I’m curious what causes that decline. Is it a lack of keeping up with what’s new? Is it ageism? I’m sure there are lots of explanations. Salary, workplace, and job hunting I prefer not drill into each and every report. I’m interested in very specific areas that are covered in the survey. And what I take away from the survey is bound to be different than your takeaways, despite numbers being what they are. So, here are a few highlights of what stood out to me personally as I combed through the results. Your experience, employment status, and company’s employer count seem to directly affect pay. For example, full-timers report higher salaries than freelancers. I suppose that makes sense, but I doubt it provides the full picture because freelancers freelance for a number of reasons, whether its flexible hours, having more choice to choose their projects, or having personal constraints that limit how much they can work. In some ways, freelancers are able to command higher pay while working less. Bad management and burnout seem to be the most talked-about issues in the workplace. Be on guard during interviews, look up reviews about the company you’re about to work for, and make sure there are far fewer complaints than accolades. Make sure you’re not being too worked up during work hours; breaks are essential for a boost in productivity. Seventy percent of folks reported no discrimination in the workplace, which means we’re perhaps doing something right. That said, it’s still disheartening that 30% experience some form of discrimination and lowering that figure is something we ought to aim for. I’m hoping companies — particularly the tech giants in our space — take note of this and enforce laws and policies surrounding this. Still, we can always call out discriminatory behavior and make corrections where necessary. And who’s to say that everyone who answered the survey felt safe sharing that sort of thing? Silence can be the enemy of progress. Never get too comfortable in your job. Although 69% report having never been laid off, I still think that job security is brittle in this space. Always learn, build, and if possible, try to look for other sources of income. Layoffs are still happening, and looking at the news, it’s likely to continue for the foreseeable future, with the U.S., Australia, and U.K. being leading the way. One number that jumped off the page for me is that it takes an average of four applications for most developers to find a new job. This bamboozles me. I’m looking for a full-time role (yes, I’m available!), and I regularly apply for more than four jobs in a given day. Perhaps I’m doing something wrong, but that’s also not consistent with those in my social and professional circles. I know and see plenty of people who are working hard to find work, and the number of jobs they apply for has to bring that number up. Four applications seems way low, though I don’t have the quantitative proof for it. Your personal network is still the best way to find a job. We will always and forever be social animals, and I think that’s why most survey participants say that coworker relationships are the greatest perk of a job. I find this to be true with my work here at CSS-Tricks. I get to collaborate with other like-minded CSS and front-end enthusiasts far and wide. I’ve developed close relationships with the editors and other writers, and that’s something I value more than any other benefits I could get somewhere else. Compensation is still a top workplace challenge. JavaScript is still the king of programming (bias alert), taking the top spot as the most popular programming language. I know you’re interested, that CSS came in at third. To my surprise, Bluesky is more popular amongst developers than X. I didn’t realize how much toxicity I’ve been exposed to at X until I opened a Bluesky account. I hate saying that the “engagement” is better, or some buzz-worthy thing like that, but I do experience more actual discussions over at Bluesky than I have for a long time at X. And many of you report the same. I hasten to say that Bluesky is a direct replacement for what X (let’s face it, Twitter) used to be, but it seems we at least have a better alternative. Health issues Without our health, we are nothing. Embrace your body for what it is: your temple. It’s a symbiotic relationship. — Mrs. N. I’m looking closer at the survey’s results on health because of the sheer number of responses that report health issues. I struggle with issues, like back pains, and that forced me to upgrade my work environment with a proper desk and chair. I tend to code on my bed, and well, it worked. But perhaps it wasn’t the best thing for my physical health. I know we can fall into the stereotype of people who spend 8-12 hours staring at two big monitors, sitting in a plush gaming chair, while frantically typing away at a mechanical keyboard. You know, the Hackers stereotype. I know that isn’t an accurate portrayal of who we are, but it’s easy to become that because of how people look at and understand our work. And if you feel a great deal of pressure to keep up with that image, I think it’s worth getting into a more healthy mindset, one that gets more than a few hours of sleep, prioritizes exercise, maintains a balanced diet, and all those things we know are ultimately good for us. Even though 20% of folks say they have no health issues at all, a whopping 80% struggle with health issues ranging from sleep deprivation to keeping a healthy weight. You are important and deserve to feel healthy. Think about your health the way you think about the UI/UX of the websites you design and build. It makes up a part of the design, but has the crucial role of turning ordinary tasks into enjoyable experiences, which in turn, transforms into an overall beautiful experience for the user. Your health is the same. Those small parts often overlooked can and will affect the great machine that is your body. Here’s a small list of life improvements you can make right now. Closing thoughts Diversity, representation, experience, income, and health. That’s what stood out to me in the 2025 State of Devs survey results. I see positive trends in the numbers, but also a huge amount of opportunity to be better, particularly when it comes being more inclusive of women, providing ample chances for upward mobility based on experience, and how we treat ourselves. Please check out the results and see what stands out to you. What do you notice? Is there anything you are able to take away from the survey that you can use in your own work or life? I’d love to know!",
