Published: March 18, 2025 Imagine a world where your code directly impacts millions of users, and where you're part of a community that's shaping the very fabric of the internet. This is Chromium, and our Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program is your invitation to join us. Your journey: From aspiration to achievement Each year, talented individuals begin their journeys as Chromium contributors through GSoC. Whether you're driven by improving web performance, enhancing user experiences, or diving deep into the Chromium engine, there's a project tailored for your unique skills and interests. For example, Ahmed Elwasefi was keen to improve accessibility in Chromium, and spent his GSoC experience working with the Chromium Accessibility team. His work led to improvements to Chromium accessibility and performance. Mentorship that matters GSoC at Chromium is more than just coding; it's about growth, mentorship, and community. You'll have seasoned engineers as your guides, offering not just technical expertise but also career advice and life lessons. This holistic mentorship is a hallmark of the Chromium GSoC experience. Consider Tao Xiong's testimonial: \"Trevor has been an outstanding mentor—patient, knowledgeable, and consistently encouraging... I'm thrilled to have reached a point where I can independently search for relevant code and fix some errors\". Such stories highlight the supportive environment that defines our community. Real projects, real impact In 2024, our GSoC contributors tackled diverse projects with tangible impact: Customizing side panels to enhance user experience. Improving audio capture on Linux, enabling seamless casting and screen sharing. Validating language settings for Android users, ensuring a more streamlined language setting. Enhancing developer resources for the Web Audio API, making web audio development more accessible. These weren't mere academic exercises; they were real contributions to a project used by millions, and demonstrate the direct impact you can have. GSoC 2025: Your adventure awaits This year, we have an array of exciting projects for GSoC 2025: Interaction to Next Paint (INP): Dive deep into web performance by helping developers gain insights into INP latency issues. Android Virtual Printer Application: Develop an Android application to emulate a printer. Chrome Extension APIs: Enhance the Chrome extension platform with new APIs and features. Chromium Web Audio Testing: Improve testing methodologies within Chromium to reduce resource consumption. Enhancing the webstatus.dev User Experience: Improve accessibility and user-friendliness across a wider range of devices. Don't just take our word for it. Jingqi Sun, who worked on size panel sizing in Chrome in 2024, noted, \"My mentors were highly supportive and provided valuable guidance throughout the project... helping me grow both personally and professionally\". We pride ourselves on maintaining a high-quality codebase, a responsive and supportive community, and a robust review process, all geared towards ensuring your success. Your Chapter in the Chromium Story Chromium GSoC is more than just a summer project; it's a launchpad for your career, a chance to make a real impact, and an opportunity to join a community that cares. Imagine seeing your code improve the browsing experience for millions worldwide. Ready to write your chapter in the Chromium story?
