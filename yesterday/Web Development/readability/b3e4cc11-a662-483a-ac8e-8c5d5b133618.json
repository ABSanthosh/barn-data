Folks write in with questions about the “other” side of web design and front-end development — not so much about tools and best practices as it is about the things that surround the work we do, like what happens if you get laid off, or AI takes your job, or something along those lines. You know, the human side of what we do in web design and development. Well, it just so happens that I’m co-hosting the show. In other words, I get to sprinkle in a little advice on top of the wonderful insights that Brad expertly doles out to audience questions. Our second episode just published, and I thought I’d share it. We’re finding our sea legs with this whole thing and figuring things out as we go. We’ve opened things up (get it?!) to a live audience and even pulled in one of Brad’s friends at the end to talk about the changing nature of working on a team and what it looks like to collaborate in a remote-first world. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bquVF5Cibaw Direct Link →",
