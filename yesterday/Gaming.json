Even its protagonist's ever-present narration crackles and whispers as if broadcast through a transistor radio picking up a signal from another realm. Read more",

    "description": "One of the strange, hard-to-grasp questions that quietly haunts a lot of games is whether we are the people we are controlling. Whether we are meant to be those people, anyway. Are we Mario, or are we his custodian for the hours in which we play? Is there one of us involved in these jumps and dashes and Goomba stomps, or two of us, and where are the boundaries to be found? Sometimes the controls in a game are so intuitive that it really feels like it's us on the other side of the screen. We're in sync. And then something will happen - a glitch, a funny movement, a cut-scene - and the gap between avatar and player becomes jarringly visible. It's odd stuff and tricky to think about for long stretches of time without starting to feel a bit weird. Read more",

    "description": "Developer Bloober Team faces a challenging balancing act in bringing a cherished 2001 classic like Silent Hill 2 to a new generation. The good news is that the Silent Hill 2 Remake - released on PlayStation 5 and PC - does capture the essence, the atmosphere of Konami's survival horror, all while making smart upgrades to its design. Despite rebuilding the game on Unreal Engine 5, you'll still recognise its iconic, foggy view over Toluca Lake at the game's start. The cutscenes are now acted out with new motion capture and voice overs and while in control, you'll explore Silent Hill's woodland trails and apartment blocks with an updated control scheme - complete with newly devised puzzles. Likewise, its soundtrack is re-arranged by legendary composer Akira Yamaoka, and even the world layout, the ordering of events, is remixed at points to keep fans, old and new alike, on their toes. Even through all these twists though, at its core, Bloober still successfully takes apart and puts back together the beating heart of what made the 2001 original work. Read more",

    "description": "For a new game studio, there are few genres as difficult to break into as that of the tactical shooter.

Newbies face a demanding set of player expectations, with a checklist that includes immaculate gunplay, perfect pacing and ultra-clear level design as the bare minimum. And only when you get beyond that do things get really interesting. What have you got that's fresh, and can encourage new forms of tactical thinking? Can you provide enough of a hook that players will want to stick around to master the mechanics? Is your game simply different enough to stand out? Read more",

How does PSSR fare in our first extended look at the technology? Is this a good replacement for native 4K, or does it fall short of that lofty target? Read more",

Made by just a two person team, developer Pounce Light has crafted a simple and charming gameplay loop: make, create, and arrange castles, villas, or cottages to your liking using the game's flexible building system. It may be cozycore on the surface, but there's plenty of bespoke stuff driving its warm pastel aesthetic, including ray-traced global illumination (RTGI), ray-traced reflections and loads of procedural tech. Impressively, it all runs really well on near-decade-old GPUs too. RT on a GTX 1060? Believe it. Read more",

    "description": "It's been 17 years since Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 and its 3D-arena-based combat graced consoles, and ever since, fans have clamored for a return to that old style. Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero has answered the call, with the benefit of an entirely new story arc to explore thanks to Dragon Ball Super--which wasn't part of the Dragon Ball canon until 2013.

Each fighter has a mix of physical and ki-based attacks, highlighted by flashy and bombastic special attacks like the Kamehameha, Final Flash, Spirit Bomb, and other iconic Dragon Ball techniques.As is immediately noticeable, the visual style of Sparking Zero is top-notch, from the main menu to the heat of battle. Every character moves and fights fluidly, and the small scenes that play during a successful ultimate attack are a delight, which makes connecting with those moves even more exhilarating.

    "description": "At the end of the 2024 Halo World Championships, 343 Industries made some big announcements about the future of Halo. The studio is rebranding as Halo Studios, and future Halo titles will now be developed in Unreal Engine 5, rather than Slipstream Engine. This move has also reignited speculation about Halo games potentially appearing on PlayStation 5. And according to industry experts, this will make porting Halo a lot easier.\"From a multi-platform game development perspective, moving to Unreal Engine 5 would certainly be easier for the developer than porting across the existing Slipspace engine,\" said Digital Foundry's Rich Leadbetter via Eurogamer. \"It stands to reason that an engine designed for deployment across multiple platforms would be easier to work with than existing technology built for Xbox and PC.\"Earlier this year, The Verge reported that Microsoft was considering bringing more games to PlayStation 5, including Halo. While Halo is one of the primary Xbox franchises, cross-platform releases have already proven to be beneficial for Microsoft. Sea of Thieves found a new audience on PS5, and Bethesda has announced plans to bring Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to the console following a few months of exclusivity on Xbox Series X|S.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Arizona Cardinals Quarterback Kyler Murray has announced a partnership with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, despite previously being criticized by fans who believed his love of the shooter was impacting his on-field performance. The partnership comes alongside a new Replacer ad, which features the Replacer taking a press conference for Murray.Murray announced the partnership deal on Twitter, writing, \"To the trolls who memed me into a bag, thank you!\" Murray is referring to previous criticism he received about playing Call of Duty too much, which came after he signed a new contract with an \"independent study\" clause, which was later removed. The clause stated Murray must spend four hours a week focused on studying football film, without other distractions, something that is relatively unheard of for starting quarterbacks in the NFL. After the contract clause was put in the public spotlight, rumors circulated that it was due to Murray playing too much Call of Duty. This led to fans making fun of Murray, even doing breakdowns of his performances on double XP weekends compared to his usual stats. The new ad even references this, with the YouTube description reading \"No need to wait for a double XP weekend when you have The Replacer.\"Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "description": "Russian development studio Ice-Pick Lodge has announced the latest entry in the Pathologic series: a follow-up to 2019's Pathologic 2 that is aptly titled Pathologic 3. The studio has also confirmed that fans of the franchise who backed Pathologic 2 via its initial 2014 KickStarter campaign will gain access to Pathologic 3 for free.The announcement was released alongside a trailer and a link to the upcoming game's Steam page, where players can add the game to their wishlist. Although Ice-Pick Lodge has yet to announce a specific release date, it has confirmed that the next chapter in Pathologic's story will arrive on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC sometime in 2025. The trailer's contents reveal that Pathologic 3 will see players experience the same events that took place in Pathologic 2, but this time they'll be seeing things through the eyes of Danil Dankovsky, also known as \"The Bachelor.\"Set in a small town located in Russia's remote steppes in the early 1900's, Pathologic follows the story of three main characters: Artemy Burakh (\"The Haruspex\"), a local healer returning to his hometown to address a recent tragedy; Danil Dankovsky (\"The Bachelor\"), a certified doctor visiting from the city in the hopes of uncovering a scientific breakthrough; and Clara (\"The Changeling\"), a mysterious young girl who has the ability to save (or end) lives with a single touch of her hands, but has no idea how or why she arrived in the town. There's no word yet regarding when players might get their hands on Clara's version of events, but after the announcement of Pathologic 3, it stands to reason that Clara's playthrough is also in the works.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

    "link": "https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-action-movies/2900-5809/",
    "description": "It's hard to imagine movies without the action genre. It's often the reigning king of the summer blockbuster season, generating tons of money with over-the-top fight sequences, stunts, and edge-of-your-seat stories. With decades of excellent, pulse-pounding action films, though, knowing the top ones to watch can be difficult. Luckily, we've done the heavy-lifting for you to bring together the best action movies of all time, according to the GameSpot team.There is nothing that gets the blood pumping faster than an intense action movie. Whether it's Bruce Willis as John McClane shooting bad guys in Die Hard or people running from dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, the genre is incredibly expansive, offering all manner of cinematic excitement.. And typically there's something for everyone. Even those who just want to watch excellent hand-to-hand combat on screen will have more than their fair share of flicks. And what if you want to see some wild car chases? There's a whole subgenre for that, featuring films like Mad Max: Fury Road and the Fast and Furious franchise. What if you want some action-based horror? Again, there's a subgenre featuring movies like Aliens.Over the decades, with action movies exploding in popularity, there have been so many big-budget blockbusters that thrilled audiences in the theaters around the world--many of these films coming from other countries that might have been missed by American audiences. With all of that in mind, let's get to it. Here are the 25 best action movies of all time, as chosen by the staff of GameSpot.Why stop at action, though? Make sure to check out the best horror movies of all time. Police Story (1985)Royal Hong Kong Police Force Sergeant Chan Ka-Kui attempts to take down a crime lord. However, after the criminal escapes Ka-Kui's grasp, the villain frames the officer for a murder, and it's up to Ka-Kui to clear his own name.In Hong Kong, Jackie Chan had already made a name for himself by 1985, with the most notable of his films to that point being Drunken Master. However, Police Story was the first of Chan's starring roles that broke through into the US, and for good reason. The US got a taste of what Hong Kong cinema had to offer. It featured dangerous stunts from an incredible team, which counted the film's star as a full member--Chan himself did everything you see his character do on screen. The sequences had the audience on the edge of their seats, as it weaved together a compelling story.Where to watch: Max Buy on Amazon Aliens (1986)Ellen Ripley wakes from stasis almost 60 years after the events of the first Alien movie. Ripley and a group of space marines are sent to a planet being terraformed by a corporation--one that Ripley knows pretty well--and they realize that these aliens are everywhere.What Alien did for sci-fi horror, Aliens did for sci-fi action. As soon as the group gets to the colony, it becomes a free-for-all. The movie doesn't lose its horror elements--there are plenty of jump-scares. However, the primary focus for this film are the numerous scenes of space marines trying their best to shoot down aliens. Coming off of the heels of The Terminator, director James Cameron took the elements that made that movie a success and turned them up to 11 with Aliens. It's more than just compelling characters and a fantastic story: It's watching a terrifying horde of foes up against a few soldiers in a battle that never seems to end.Where to watch: Hulu, Disney+, Max Buy on Amazon RoboCop (1987)Taking place in Detroit in the near, dystopian future, an evil corporation rules over the police department and wants to enforce the law using robots. Meanwhile, a hard-working human officer is mortally wounded and turned into half-man, half-cop: RoboCop. This cyborg law enforcer takes down criminals and the corrupt institution that created him.RoboCop, the character, became a pop-culture phenomenon for all ages, appearing on cartoons, getting action figures, and even wrestling in WCW. The movie, however, is very much not for kids. It's brutal. It's violent. It's social commentary on police violence and corporations taking over every aspect of life. And it undeniably had a huge impact on dystopian action movies and its lead characters. The movie never pulls its punches and delivers a gun-fueled adrenaline rush, powered by the performance of Peter Weller as the hybrid man/machine.Where to watch: Max Buy on Amazon Die Hard (1988)While attending an office party at Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles with his estranged wife, a New York City police officer finds himself in the middle of a terrorist takeover, and only he can save the day.Die Hard is a great example of the one-man-army trope becoming a huge hit. It's not the same type of action you'd see in a typical version of that trope because Die Hard elevates it. Between the gunshots are scenes of tension and the lead character, John McClane, rising to complete his hero's journey. He's just a normal, everyday man, taking the fight back to the villains who took over a building. Bruce Willis was already a rising star when Die Hard released, but this movie made him an icon.Where to watch: Hulu, Disney+, YouTube TV Buy on Amazon Terminator 2 (1991)Years after the events of The Terminator, a cyborg that looks exactly like the one that tried to kill Sarah Connor in the first movie returns to protect her and her son from another futuristic robot. In doing so, they'll save the human race from the robot uprising.Terminator 2 takes a lot of what we saw in the first movie and flips it on its head, while raising the stakes. Connor thought she prevented the end of the world by surviving the events of the first movie. But that's not the case. The antagonist returns as a hero, and a more dangerous, seemingly unkillable villain emerges. Much like Cameron's Aliens, T2 takes everything fans loved about the first movie and turned up the volume. The movie is still rooted in the dystopian horror of what's to come, but makes a hard left turn into action. The film features numerous edge-of-your seat moments, eye-popping practical and digital visual effects, plenty of excellent fighting scenes, and an epic finale in a steel mill.Where to watch: Paramount+, Fubo, Netflix Buy on Amazon Demolition Man (1993)A police officer and a criminal are cryogenically frozen and find themselves resuscitated nearly 40 years later. Once again, the officer is tasked with taking down this criminal in an unusual future that, while seemingly utopian on the surface, is hiding plenty of deadly secrets.As you already know, sci-fi and action movies are a perfect fit; however, what separates Demolition Man from many in this genre is that it presents most of its futuristic setting as a utopian, not dystopian, future. It takes place in a world where violence is a thing of the past, and when you throw in your typical action-movie violence, the reaction of the other characters in this world is just as great as the intense sequences themselves.However, not everything is as great as it seems, on the surface, as there's a growing rebellion underground, which the villain is trying to stop.Where to rent/buy: Prime Video, Microsoft Store Buy on Amazon Jurassic Park (1993)An entrepreneur uses revolutionary technology to clone dinosaurs, which he plans to use to open a dinosaur zoo. Of course, before the zoo can open, everything goes wrong, and a group of people have to run for their lives because cloned dinosaurs will kill you as easily as actual dinosaurs.Jurassic Park is one of those action movies where you know that the humans won't win and can only hope to escape with their lives. There's no way for them to actually beat the dinos, outside of the island being bombed with napalm--like in the book! What makes this a great action film is the suspense of the humans on the run. They're placed in numerous situations where the cast is on the run and on the brink of being eaten. The sets, monsters, and characters' reactions to these situations make this a great action movie. If you ever wondered what a dinosaur slasher movie killer would be like, look no further than the raptors. Additionally, this is a movie that weaved CGI and practical effects together exceptionally well, and the CGI still holds up, more than 30 years later.Where to watch: Hulu Live TV, YouTube TV Buy on Amazon Heat (1995)Written and directed by Michael Mann, Heat follows a group of thieves who go on elaborate heists. However, the LAPD catches up to them and they feel \"the heat\" of potentially being busted.The typical heist film features numerous scenes of a group of thieves working together to accomplish the impossible, and that's how Heat kicks things off. The kicker for Heat is that a lot of the action comes by way of suspenseful moments with these criminals on the run. It's a fantastic melding of action, drama, and suspense. The performances of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are iconic and this film was highly influential within filmmaking and even video games.Where to watch: Paramount+ Buy on Amazon Mission: Impossible franchise (1996)Based on a TV series, Mission: Impossible follows a spy named Ethan Hunt who finds himself in various situations of double-crosses, triple-crosses, and terrorists trying to destroy the world.The Mission: Impossible franchise can get a little convoluted at times, but there's a reason there have been seven--soon to be eight--movies in this franchise: the out-of-this-world stunts and action sequences. Each film features star Tom Cruise in an incredible stunt sequence that gets people talking. Even the worst Mission: Impossible movies (We see you, M:I 2) have incredible action sequences laced throughout, and they only seem to get bigger and more engaging with each new movie. The best ones, though, like M:I III, Fallout, and Ghost Protocol, though, are action-movie experiences that are largely unrivaled by any other franchise.Where to watch: Paramount+ Buy on Amazon The Fifth Element (1997)In the distant future, a cab driver stumbles upon a mysterious woman who has a connection to the embodiment of evil and a cosmic weapon that can destroy it.When you see Milla Jovovich and Bruce Willis starring in a movie together, you know you're likely going to get a fantastic action movie. Will Willis's character shoot people? Yes. Will Jovovich's character kick and punch people? Yes. The film isn't 100% action. It's surrounded by a futuristic landscape, aliens, and a comical villain, which ultimately almost makes this a parody of sci-fi action or, at the very least, a commentary on them. However, the exposition and story told between the action sequences are what make those fight scenes so much more exciting.Where to watch: AMC+ Buy on Amazon Face/Off (1997)An FBI agent undergoes a cutting-edge procedure that sees him assume the identity of a terrorist by physically having the evildoer's face replace his own. Then the terrorist wakes up, takes the FBI agent's face, and goes undercover as him. Chaos ensues.The plot is incredibly wild--and a lot of fun. Director John Woo brings his gruff action style to this almost-unbelievable story and makes it work. To boil it down, it's a story about trust and deception. Woo's action sequences are quick and intense: a style he perfected in the past with Hard Boiled and The Killer. The type of action Woo presents to an audience is different from other action movies. It's far more stylized with the camerawork from Woo, which includes high camera angles and dramatic movements.. Face/Off is very suspenseful, even when the plot is two people swapping faces.Where to watch: Paramount+ Buy on Amazon The Mummy (1999)An American in the French Foreign Legion heads to an archaeological dig, where an ancient city was revealed. Inside the city is a mummy who is brought back to life, and said mummy wants to reincarnate his dead lover.The Mummy has a lot of familiar elements. In many ways, there's a lot of overlap between this movie and Indiana Jones. However, The Mummy sits firmly in the genre of action, as it primarily features a group of memorable characters on the run--and occasionally fighting back--against a supernatural force. However, unlike Jurassic Park, you know these heroes have a fighting chance against the villain, and the primary way they'll win is through huge action sequences and magic. While Brendan Fraser was primarily known for comedies prior to The Mummy, it showed that he has what it takes to play an action star and a compelling tough guy.Where to watch: Peacock, Fubo Buy on Amazon The Matrix (1999)A hacker named Neo is offered an escape from reality, which he discovers is one created by machines. He and other humans leverage the fake reality they came from, using superhuman advantages in that simulation, to try to take down the machines.The Matrix changed everything for the look and feel of modern action. Right from the start of the film, the viewer is treated to the character Trinity running on walls, dodging bullets, and beating up multiple people. As the film continues and Neo learns about what he can and can't do in this machine-created reality, it gets the viewers pumped because these characters are all placed in escalating situations where the action gets more and more intense. And while Keanu Reeves has been in action movies in the past, his intense performance in The Matrix made him an action star.Where to rent/buy: Prime Video, Microsoft Store Buy on Amazon The Bourne Identity (2002)A man with amnesia finds himself being hunted by assassins. He needs to know why this is happening, as the government is hunting him down in order to stop him from remembering what he did in the past.The Bourne Identity puts viewers right alongside Jason Bourne. We feel the confusion. We want to learn more about why people are trying to kill him. In doing that, we feel just as confused as Bourne, which heightens the excitement of these scenes where Bourne is punching people or evading gunshots. Star Matt Damon has proven he's great in dramas and comedies prior to this film. He also had a role in Saving Private Ryan to show some of his action chops. However, The Bourne Identity showed that Damon really can lead his own action movie, which is now pretty obvious, since there were a number of Bourne movies made after this.Where to watch: Starz Buy on Amazon Kill Bill series (2003)An assassin wakes after a coma, and she vows revenge on everyone who wronged her.The two Kill Bill movies are easily summarizable, and that's perfectly fine, because these movies are a love letter to numerous genres: action, martial arts, and more. Both movies have the viewer following this main character from set to set, fighting and killing these incredibly talented, and tough, rival assassins. Kill Bill is an arcade beat-'em-up in the best ways possible. Uma Thurman had already been in one Quentin Tarantino film (Pulp Fiction), but the two come together again to produce something magical here: one of the most important action movies featuring a woman in the lead role.Where to watch: Prime Video Buy on Amazon Old Boy (2003)A man imprisoned for 15 years inside of a small apartment is released into the world and wants to seek revenge on the person who put him there.Old Boy is a masterpiece in filmmaking. It's a brilliant mystery, drama, and action movie, all rolled into one. The action sequences can be exceptionally intense and brutal. Remember that hallway fight scene from the Daredevil TV show? That's a clear homage to Old Boy, which features an even more intense version of that. That's one of the most memorable moments of the film--a very long, single-shot sequence of the main character, walking down a hallway, and beating a plethora of thugs.Where to watch: Netflix Buy on Amazon Collateral (2004)A cab driver picks up a client: an assassin who holds the cabbie hostage and forces him to drive from hit to hit.Tom Cruise does action exceptionally well, and Collateral takes Cruise on a much darker path. His character Vincent is intense and intimidating, leaving you to watch him go from scene to scene, fighting and murdering people. Each scene features unique elements, with the assassin slowly getting beaten down but somehow surviving.Where to watch: Paramount+ Buy on Amazon Hot Fuzz (2007)An overzealous London police officer is sent to a small village to continue his job, where he uncovers a sinister plot.Hot Fuzz is a love letter to action movies. There is even a scene where the two main characters watch a bunch of '90s action movies. Of course, this movie contains a lot of action sequences featuring gun fights and fist fights, but one of the great things Hot Fuzz does is utilizing quick cuts between scenes to create a sense of dynamism and excitement, even if it's a scene of someone buying an ice cream cone in the local shop. Hot Fuzz was a follow-up to Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead--a parody of zombie movies--and because this film also stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, the audience once again stands behind these two characters. It doesn't hurt that Pegg's portrayal of grizzled officer Nicholas Angel is an extreme version of the one-man-army trope, as it's done to perfection.Where to watch: Peacock Buy on Amazon Fast Five (2011)The family comes back together to plan a fascinating heist in Brazil, but standing in their way are a drug lord and a federal agent played by Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson.The first three Fast \u0026 Furious movies were about racing cars. The fourth film in the franchise was a transition between car racing and action. Fast Five was the first film in the Fast Saga to nail down what would elevate the series to the heights it's since reached: heists, over-the-top action, and what feels like a complete lack of self-awareness. The action sequences are ridiculous in the best way possible and constantly disobey the laws of physics. The film closes with the family dragging a giant safe through the streets of Rio de Janeiro as it smashes through anything--and anyone--in its way. While it's incredibly ridiculous at face value, it's a moment that will have you stand up to cheer. Also, somehow, over a decade later, the dangling plot threads from this movie were picked up in Fast X.Where to watch: Peacock, Fubo, SlingTV Buy on Amazon The Raid/The Raid 2 (2011)A group of police officers raids an apartment building to take down a crime lord. They're ambushed and the survivors work their way up each floor, fighting everyone.Both of The Raid movies follow what seems like a traditional cop film: a group of police officers take down a bad guy, and there's collateral damage along the way. What The Raid movies do differently is they continually raises the stakes through increasingly impossible odds. The audience is treated to long takes of intense action sequences that make you want to rewatch the film--or at least these scenes. It's a style of filmmaking we haven't seen much of in recent cinema and because of that, it feels incredibly fresh. The sequel is a great follow-up, and while it takes the film in a different direction with more espionage elements, it's still 100% an amazing action movie.Where to rent/buy: Prime Video, Microsoft Store Buy on Amazon Skyfall (2012)James Bond must hunt down a threat that has targeted and attacked MI6.This was Daniel Craig's third outing as 007 and is considered one of the better films during his run. There are a lot of spectacular action sequences, which Bond fans have come to expect throughout the series. There is a heart-pumping sequence where Bond is fighting someone on top of a train. There's another memorable moment that looks incredible, featuring a silhouetted fight scene with a neon backdrop. There is another action aspect of this movie that lots of people remember: when Bond booby-traps a house--Home Alone-style, and it's shockingly good. The action is great and so are the aesthetics. As far as action goes, Skyfall does it better than any other Bond film.Where to watch: Prime Video Buy on Amazon Dredd (2012)In a dystopian future, Americans live in an extremely large city called Mega-City One. In one of the slum Mega-Block buildings, a police officer/judge named Dredd and his psychic partner work their way through the residential building with 750,000 people inside in order to take down a drug lord who locked down the block.Dredd isn't the first adaptation of the Judge Dredd comic, but it is definitely the superior one. That's beside the point, though. This is an action movie about a cop working their way through a building to take down the bad guy--not unlike The Raid, which was in production at the same time as Dredd. However, Dredd adds its own spin to this trope by adding in some cool science fiction and visuals--like the Slo-Mo drug affecting people during action sequences. The film uses high-tech weaponry to deliver action sequences in surprising ways, all while the heroes are being hunted down, with danger around every corner.Where to watch: Prime Video Buy on Amazon John Wick (2014)A man's dog is killed by a Russian mob member, and he seeks his revenge on the killer--and everyone who stands in his way.It's hard to remember that John Wick was originally an indie film, considering how popular and big-budget the franchise has become. The film that kicked off the series is full of martial arts, brutal fight scenes, plenty of close-up gun play, and an incredibly deep lore featuring gold coins, a hierarchy of assassins, and chain of hotels. It also helps that Keanu Reeves returns to an action movie, but compared to The Matrix, the violence is incredibly grounded and brutal. It felt revolutionary for its time because the main character is right up in the action, and because of all his loss, he's not afraid to die, so long as he gets his revenge.Where to rent/buy: YouTube, Fandango, Prime Video Buy on Amazon Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)Post-apocalyptic action hero Max Rockatansky returns and teams with a group of female prisoners--and one enforcer--to take down an evil city ruler.It had been a long time since George Miller got behind a camera to take viewers to the dystopian world we loved decades ago, but it was worth the wait. Fury Road did not disappoint and is the best film in the Mad Max series. There are spectacular car-chase scenes throughout the film, all using massively scaled practical effects, which is something most Hollywood movies have moved away from. The film is intense and unlike anything else we've seen in action, and features incredible performances from a nearly silent Tom Hardy as Max and Charlize Theron as Furiosa: the coolest person in the post-apocalypse.Where to watch: Max Buy on Amazon The Night Comes For Us (2018)A Triad gang enforcer finds himself caught up in a violent insurrection inside of his own crime family, while he's on a mission to protect a young girl.The Night Comes For Us delivers everything you want from an action film: intense hand-to-hand combat, one-vs.-many sequences, and plenty of suspenseful moments. The scene of the main character Ito taking on a large group of gang members in a warehouse is easily the most memorable part of the movie, as he fights them, one-by-one, killing most of them with a pool cue ball. It's hard to not love when an action movie works unique weapons into its arsenal.Where to watch: Netflix",

    "description": "The best thing about an anime or a manga series reaching its end is that you can dive into it and not have to worry about cliffhangers. Attack on Titan is a fine example of this, and for Prime Big Deal Days, you can pick up the entire saga in print form at its best price yet. If you've never read it, Attack on Titan has long been hailed as one of the best stories told in print and on TV. A harrowing tale of survival in a world filled with almost-unkillable man-eating giants, the series has steampunk action and gruesome devastation, and it touches on heavy themes like genocide.What's nice about these Attack on Titan omnibus editions is that you're getting the maximum bang for your buck when it comes to reading material. You're getting three regular manga volumes in one chunky edition--except for the final omnibus in this series--and on average these are almost 600 pages in size. That gives you a chunk of story to read through in a single sitting, and the early chapters feature some of the lowest prices here as the second and third volumes are less than $8 each.Attack on Titan omnibus editionsAttack on Titan omnibus editionAttack on Titan Omnibus Volume 1 -- $12.90 ($20)Attack on Titan Omnibus Volume 2 -- $7.72 ($20)Attack on Titan Omnibus Volume 3 -- $6.80 ($18)Attack on Titan Omnibus Volume 4 -- $16.43 ($20)Attack on Titan Omnibus Volume 5 -- $13.98 ($20)Attack on Titan Omnibus Volume 6 -- $16.87 ($20)Attack on Titan Omnibus Volume 7 -- $11.85 ($20)Attack on Titan Omnibus Volume 8 -- $11.51 ($20)Attack on Titan Omnibus Volume 9 -- $18.60 ($20)Attack on Titan Omnibus Volume 10 -- $17.21 ($20)Attack on Titan Omnibus Volume 11 -- $15.30 ($18)Attack on Titan Omnibus Volume 12 -- $14 ($18)Attack on Titan manga season collectionsAttack on Titan manga season collectionIf you'd like to try something different, you can also pick up manga collections that are in line with the anime adaptation.

    "description": "Developer 4J Studios has shared the first gameplay trailer of Reforj, an open-world sandbox being developed by the Minecraft co-developer. The people in charge of porting Minecraft to consoles, as well as content packs are now working on their own iteration of the genre, presenting a voxel-crafted world to build, explore, and survive within.The gameplay might seem familiar at first glance if you're a Minecraft fan, but there are some subtleties that are already teasing some different novelties. The character has the ability to glide, both outside and inside dungeons, making for a more fast-paced way of traversal. There are first and third-person cameras for gliding, too. The usual resource-gathering actions present some novelty, too. The gameplay showcases being able to manipulate objects and their shapes at a distance while building. You can pick up items quite quickly by destroying an entire tree just by destroying one block near the root, as well as taking down three blocks simultaneously in one go. Crucially, there aren't any specific tools on display while doing these tasks.Continue Reading at GameSpot",

It’s just a list of more or less random questions I’ve been posting on this blog every Monday morning for the past quadrillion years (since 2007). 1. Last person who complimented you on your makeup? My coworker last week. I was wearing a little more coverage than usual, so I think the overall look was more polished than the bare bones FOTDs I’ve been wearing for months now. Amazing what a difference a little bit of concealer makes! 2. Last dream you can remember? Marnie and I were like the Scooby Doo detectives in our neighborhood, ha ha ha! We were working a case to unveil who had stolen all the tuna sandwiches in our circle. 3. Today the temperature in my neighborhood is/was ____. The Bay Area is experiencing a heat wave, ugh! It’s supposed to hit 94. I’m so over it. 4. Your cookie of choice? Lately I’ve been obsessed with snickerdoodles.[Continue reading...] The post Makeup and Beauty Blog Monday Poll, Vol. 851 appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

    "description": "Rosie soaked up the last bits of summery weather today. She enjoyed basking underneath the trees, which still have leaves on them (but not for long). Among the many things she contemplated were cold fusion, a better way to produce nutritionally dense cat treats, how Marnie the dog is slowly ruining her life, and most importantly, what she’ll wear for Halloween. Unlike Tabs, who loved elaborate costumes, Rosie likes to keep it simple and chic. I asked if she needed any help brainstorming, but all I got were slow blinks and a tum flash in return. When it got too hot to be outside, Rosie made her way back indoors. I couldn’t help but notice her ignoring Marnie… I suspect Rosie’s afraid of Marnie rocking a costume that will steal Rosie’s thunder. Marnie, on the other hand, hasn’t even begun to think about Halloween. She started Marathoning Gilmore Girls this weekend, and she’s currently obsessed.

    "description": "1. It does so much makeup heavy lifting. I swear, I can get away with wearing so much less makeup when I’m wearing a bright lip. I can feel completely put together with just a bright lipstick, mascara and concealer. 2. Bright lipstick shouts however you’re feeling out loud to the world. A smile is that much bigger and brighter with a bright lip. 3. It’s a classic. Red lipstick never goes out of style! 4. The long-wearing matte formulas have improved so much. They last through water, coffee, cat kisses… 5. They’re just so fun to collect! You can never have enough. 🙂 Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict, Karen The post 5 Reasons to Love Bright Lipstick appeared first on Makeup and Beauty Blog | Makeup Reviews, Swatches and How-To Makeup.",

I forgot how beautiful it looks in pictures! The Honest Beauty eyeshadow palette comes with a card with four looks you can do with the palette. I followed the one called “Classic Smoky Eye” for this post, although with one tweak. I started by buffing the matte beige shade (Vanilla’d Velvet) all over my lids as a base so the subsequent colors would pop a little more. I was a wee bit nervous about using the shimmery gold all over my lids and the shimmery dark purple on the outer corner because…I’m in my 40s now, and shine doesn’t always play well with my 40-something skin, particularly in the crease. Some may even say that I’m “overly picky about shimmery finishes,” *ahem*. Can you blame me though? One false move and you see every fine line!

If you could move anywhere in the world without having to put any effort into it at all (assume someone takes care of the packing, logistics, paperwork, finances, etc.), where would you go? I’d move us to the Manoa neighborhood on Oahu in a heartbeat. 3. What’s a weird breakfast that you like to eat?

To celebrate the occasion, Halo Studios have released some footage of Project Foundry, an expansive Unreal Engine 5 prototype and spawning vat for actual Halo games, which is billed by the Xbox Newswire as a kind of ur-Halo - \"a true reflection of what would be required for a new Halo game using Unreal, and a training tool for how to get there\".

    "description": "Graham asked me if I'd discovered what the metaphor in Metaphor: ReFantazio might be, and I replied, \"I don't know haha\", or something along those lines. Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect. Metaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed. Read more",

    "description": "There’s a genre of lesser fun that only makes itself known to me once I’ve completely given up on enjoying a game in any traditional sense, lurking under the surface like a silly icon on a losing scratchcard. I’ll call it ‘system tourism’ in lieu of something better. It’s not like the actually fulfilling virtual tourism you might do in something like Yakuza’s Kamurocho, where you’re scarfing down deep fried whiskeys, entranced by the lights. It’s more like doing a Google street view tour of Venice’s canals to see if you can spot someone taking a leak off the side of a gondola - hunting for anarchic anomalies because, honestly, the sights just aren’t grabbing you. At the risk of sounding like some sort of horrible joy-mathematician: My experience with open world zombie survival game Dread Dawn involved precisely two and half discrete instances of fun, plus some additional appreciation for a few genuinely good ambient bits I’ll get into shortly. With a significant overhaul of basically every player interaction Dread Dawn offers - from the abysmally tedious looting to the rusty combat - it might some day be worth your time. It harbours some incredible ambition, though it’s surrounded by murk and detritus, like a dictatorial rat in a toilet bowl. Mostly, though, I can only give you advance warning to avoid it.

    "description": "My default movement mode in horror games that actually scare me is: meandering. I seek to approach without approaching, scooting back and forth across the path like a stray hamster, worrying at the corners and avoiding clear perspectives of the route ahead, while keeping the route behind me in my peripheral vision. I have been trained to do this especially by Amnesia, where tilting your gaze too decisively at anything nasty drives your character nuts. Lurks Within Walls has no time for my hamstery antics. Developed by Here Be Monsters, it's a grid- and turn-based first-person dungeon crawler - a long-lost cousin of Etrian Odyssey that has wound up in an asylum jammed with internet cryptids, reminiscent in cinematic texture of F.E.A.R. In keeping with other grid-based dungeon crawlers, it only lets you turn the view by 90 degree angles and travel in straight lines. Going by the demo, it's a promising restraint for a horror game, though they really do need to expand on the combat, which is currently a slight waste of some terrific creature art. Read more",

Its visuals are stark and foreboding, its dialogue delivered in riddles, and its haunting choral music sounds like it's been recorded in a wind tunnel. It’s a point-and-click that calls back to early 90’s Lucas Arts adventure games, and while it shares the same frustrations, the presentation makes it feel entirely contemporary. What begins as a standard detective game - chatting to strangers, rummaging through junk, finding addresses found on the net - soon spirals into something else entirely. I’ve finished it twice and I’m still not sure I totally understand what it all means. Read more",

I’ve seen, read, heard, intuited and telepathically detected a lot of complaints about Outlaws stealth, ranging from “it doesn’t look realistic when she punches out stormtroopers through their blaster-resistant hats” to “please remove the hide-and-seek entirely, I wishly merely to pew-pew”. Seems likely that the patch won’t lay all these grievances to rest, to say nothing of the other problems people have with Outlaws.

While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do after remaking Silent Hill 2.

I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer. Read more",

    "description": "One blemish on Throne and Liberty’s barnstorming release – one day in and it’s so far up the Steam charts it’s only visible by telescope – has been some unexpected Steam Deck trouble. Despite the fantasy MMORPG having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began trickling in of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: Easy Anti-Cheat, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error. Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a Steam Deck OLED as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many. Read more",

There's an Ashkenazi rabbi, a Saxon serf, some French knights, a Czech spy, a German dwarf, and a pair of inseparable Italian peasants. This rowdy band of roustabouts I've collected in the Crusader Kings 3's Roads To Power expansion has the feeling of a found family, each fellow wanderer sporting their own ambitions and quirks. They won't all make it. Many of the people I'm looking at in the glow of these embers will fall on the road, victims of robbery, landslides, and animal attacks. One of them will sacrifice their life to save the rest of us. All will bring me a step closer to my goal: I am walking from Ireland to China. Read more",

And yet, living in Wales for the last decade must have rubbed off. The sweet sheep, they sing to me. The relative rarity of stop motion and other practical effects in horror media is surely one of the greater tragedies of our age, although not too surprising given the incredible amount of work it takes.

The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. Specifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a \"cursed\" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees. Read more",

Developed by Yustas and published by Wall World and Beholder outfit Alawar, it casts you as an AI mayor, Iris, who is trying to create the perfect city in a world of social and economic calamity. A world of social and economic calamity that looks, nonetheless, rather pleasant. I like the art deco retro-future vibe. Read more",

    "description": "Something feels off. I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first. That is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.

A newer, shinier journey to a similar setting sounded like just the ticket. After spending a few hours with the preview build, I do have at least one bit of very positive news to share: I’m definitely going to play Arcanum now, because despite some fetching environments and potentially interesting social systems, New Arc Line just isn’t doing it for me.

In fact, the game’s demo managed to make me go “oooh” then “ah!” in three different ways before I’d even exited the starting elevator. It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep. Read more",

Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. Conversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components.

The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects. I go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?

Speaking as both a news editor and a former paperboy, who broke his mind and body hauling obese Sunday editions to the millionaire houses at the top of the valley, Paperboy is my role model. Or he would be if my role model weren't actually Steven Spielberg's Freakazoid. Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza. This, at least, is the condensed analysis offered by Food Boy, which launched this week on Steam. Read more",

You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have \"consequential dialogue choices\" and a \"Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads\".

    "description": "Like a samurai poised patiently for an opening in their opponent’s defences, Shogun Showdown understands that focus and finesse are the means to delivering an impactful blow. This rare roguelike distils the genre down to its purest components, all in favour of amplifying its dizzying combat that plays gracefully with the concepts of positioning and patience. Highly refined, stylish and complex, Shogun Showdown is a delight. Read more",

    "description": "These apparitions and portents, Crystal Dynamics - what game are you playing now? It turns out the game they are playing is: a remaster of amazeballs vampire odyssey Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver, together with its less amazing but sturdy sequel. Said remaster project was rumoured earlier this year, when Sarafan scouts caught sight of a telltale plaque at San Diego Comic-Con. Consider that rumour strongly trending towards the status of a Real Thing, because Sony are in the habit of publishing Real Things, and they've just (accidentally, I guess) popped a bunch of screens and a trailer with a release date - 10th December 2024 - on the PlayStation website.

    "description": "Look out, it's Spiders. It's fun to write about Spiders, because you get to frighten people for a moment, before they realise you're talking about the game development studio, Spiders. They have just released GreedFall 2: The Dying Land into early access. For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the \"old world\". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks. Read more",
