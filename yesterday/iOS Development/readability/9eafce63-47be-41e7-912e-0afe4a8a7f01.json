  "description": "Before I went to work for Audible (five years ago now — time flies!) I had a bias about engineers that worked for large corporations. I assumed that they weren’t as good as indies and engineers at small companies, or else they’d actually be indies or work at small shops like Omni. Obviously I knew there had to be exceptions, particularly at Apple, or else we wouldn’t have had great things like AppKit and UIKit and everything else we’ve built on over these years. But the bias persisted. * * * Before Audible, the largest company I’d ever worked at (Newsgator) had just over 100 people. When I worked at Omni it had roughly half that number. I’ve spent half my career working at even smaller companies, with just me and Sheila (Ranchero Software) or at places with three people (Q Branch) or like six people (UserLand Software). And of course I was arrogant enough to think that I was better — much better — than any corporate engineer. While a corporate engineer might own some small part of an app or framework — or just a single button, as the (lame) joke went back in the day — I was shipping entire apps on my own or with a very small team. Popular, valuable, newsworthy apps that people loved. And I wasn’t the only one: think of Flying Meat, Rogue Amoeba, Bare Bones, Red Sweater, The Iconfactory and many more. * * * And so I learned very quickly when I started at Audible that I was very wrong. I was impressed, and grew more impressed as time went on, by my fellow engineers’ rigor, talent, professionalism, care, and, especially, ability to work with other people toward common goals. While I’m the die-hard introvert who just wants to go into a room and sit in front of a Mac and write some code and get things done, I learned that my co-workers — even if they, like me, kinda just wanted to sit and write code — were great at app development as a team sport. I was impressed with how they wanted to grow and did grow — always leveling-up their individual skills and their ability to work on a team and across teams. And what a team it was! It’s not a new observation, but the indies I mentioned above, and the ones I didn’t, tend to be white men born in the United States — the people who could most afford to fail, in other words, because for them (for me, absolutely) there’s always another opportunity. My team didn’t look like that — it was quite a contrast with my previous experience. Many more women, people of color, people born outside the United States. (But note that there’s always more progress to be made!) The engineers on my team could write apps as well, if not better in many cases, than the indies I know. And the ones who aren’t quite there yet — well, just give them a little more time. They’ve all given me reason to believe in them. I regret my bias about engineers working in corporate environments, and I’m so glad I learned the truth almost from day one on starting at Audible. * * * For a couple years I did a lot of hiring — a lot of interviews — at Audible. And I noticed something: there was a strong correlation between being hirable and having worked with other people. The folks who’d worked largely by themselves, or on just one small team, weren’t as good candidates as the folks who’d worked with more people. This, of course, went against my original bias that indies are the best engineers — but by then I knew that a candidate who’d worked with lots of other people had been exposed to more code, more dilemmas, more challenges (technical and human), and they were not just more ready to work on a larger team but more knowledgeable. Even their individual skills were greater. Advice time: if you’re a newer engineer, find ways to work with other people. Not just because you’re more likely to get hired at a place like Audible — but because, no matter where you want to work, you’ll be better at it. You can’t just sit alone in front of your computer all day and write code and expect to be a great engineer. Lesson learned! * * * With retirement imminent — this is my last job, and June 6 is my last day (maybe I’ve buried the lede here) — I want to thank my team publicly for how they’ve made me a better engineer and, more importantly, a better person. From the bottom of my heart. I learned more from them than I could ever have taught; I got the better part of this deal. Thank you, team! So much. ❤️",
