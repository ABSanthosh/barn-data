Three Philosphers Interject I bought the dang bread, and she didnâ€™t mind. I spent the whole afternoon thinking about that moment, and why it meant so much to me. In the end, I came back to three philosophers and their philosophies. John Rawls John Rawlsâ€™ Veil of Ignorance is a thought experiment about how to design a just society. Imagine yourself behind a veil of ignorance, where you donâ€™t know your place in that society. You donâ€™t know your race, gender, class, talents, or job â€” and because you could end up a CEO or a janitor, youâ€™d rationally choose to build a society rooted in fairness and decency for all. Now imagine youâ€™re born into a world where you could be a human or a duck. Humans shape the world to their whims, while ducks hunt for scraps and take handouts from strangers. What if you were the duck â€” not the one giving bread, but the one hoping someone kind might offer you a piece? Thatâ€™s the essence of contractualism. This is not a truly just world â€” but it is our world. Blaise Pascal Pascalâ€™s Wager is a similar framework â€” but more inward-looking. Blaise Pascal argued that the only rational thing to do is believe in God. Why? If you believe in God and youâ€™re right, you gain infinite reward: a spot in heaven for the rest of eternity. If you believe in God and youâ€™re wrong, you lose a little: some wasted time and lifestyle shifts. If you donâ€™t believe in God and youâ€™re wrong, you risk infinite loss: eternal fiery damnation. If you donâ€™t believe in God and youâ€™re right, you only gain a little: temporary freedom and earthly pleasures. I think about Pascalâ€™s Wager a lot â€” not just when Iâ€™m wondering about my everlasting fate. Feeding ducks good bread isnâ€™t exactly a God-tier question, but I do often ask: what are the consequences of my choices if Iâ€™m right or wrong about my assumptions? Itâ€™s often worth putting in the extra effort â€” because maybe Iâ€™m wrong, and thereâ€™s more to this mortal plane than I know. Immanuel Kant And then we have Deontology â€” or more specifically, Kantian Ethics. Kant believed that morality isnâ€™t about outcomes or self-interest â€” itâ€™s about duty, reason, and universal principles. His Categorical Imperative says: Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law. That's a philosophical way of saying Kant believed in the Golden Rule. If I were a duck, Iâ€™d want the good bread just like any person does. And so, as a human, I have a responsibility to feed ducks the good bread. Back to Central Park Reader, I did not feed the ducks the good bread. Not because Iâ€™m morally bankrupt â€” we simply did not find enough ducks to feed the giant loaf of bread Iâ€™d stressed about all day. The few we did find got some decent sandwich bread leftover from our picnic. When I got home, I left out the remainder of our picnic for the neighborhood birds â€” some fruit that they seemed to appreciate. The next day, we used the good bread to make delicious sandwiches and played lovingly with our little cat. Not feeding the ducks wasnâ€™t a moral failing â€” it was just a coincidence. Sometimes, you need to find more ducks in your life so you can feed them the good bread. Spend some time looking for a duck to feed â€” you might be surprised how much it fills you up, too. Look â€” no one really knows how any of this works. Not Kant, not Pascal, not Rawls. But I feel pretty strongly that small acts go a long way. So when you get the chance, you should feed ducks the good bread. Metaphorically speaking, of course. It turns out that bread isnâ€™t great for ducks, and ethics are complicated â€” but kindness is always warranted.Joe Fabisevich is an indie developer creating software at Red Panda Club Inc. while writing about design, development, and building a company.
