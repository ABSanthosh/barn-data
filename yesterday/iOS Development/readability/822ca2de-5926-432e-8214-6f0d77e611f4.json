  "description": "It’s an ice-cold late winter’s morning in Canada, but the offices of Ubisoft Quebec are ablaze with excitement.The Ubisoft team is preparing the release of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, the 14th main entry in the series and an evolution for the franchise in nearly every detail. It’s set in feudal 16th-century Japan, a rich and elegant period that’s been long sought-after by fans and Ubisoft team members alike. It introduces a pair of fierce protagonists: Yasuke, a powerful warrior of African origin, and Naoe, an agile Shinobi assassin, both brought to life with attention to historical accuracy. Its world feels alive with an ever-changing dynamism that’s apparent in everything from the shifting weather to the rotating seasons to the magical interplay of light and shadow.And what’s more, it’s set to release on Mac the same day it arrives on PCs and consoles.“It’s been a longtime dream to bring the game to Mac,” says Ubisoft executive producer Marc-Alexis Côté, who debuted the game on Mac during the WWDC24 Keynote. “It’s incredible that I can now open a MacBook Pro and get this level of immersion.” Shadows will also be coming later to iPad with M-series chips.Naoe, one of the game’s two protagonists, is an agile assassin who’s at her best when striking from the shadows.Today marks one of the first times that the gaming community will get its hands on Shadows, and to celebrate the occasion, the Ubisoft offices — a mix of cozy chalet-worthy reclaimed wood and wide-open windows that afford a view of snowy Quebec City rooftops — have been reskinned with an Assassin’s Creed theme, including a display that emphasizes the heft of Yasuke’s weapons, especially an imposing-looking 13-pound model of the character’s sword. (On this day, the display is hosted by associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois, who appears quite capable of wielding it.)Pre-order Assassin's Creed Shadows from the Mac App StoreCôté calls Shadows his team’s “most ambitious” game. In crafting the game’s expansive world, Ubisoft’s development team took advantage of an array of advanced Mac technologies: Metal 3 (working in concert with Ubisoft’s next-generation Anvil engine), Apple silicon, and a mix of HDR support and real-time ray tracing on Macs with M3 and M4 that Côté says was “transformative” in creating the game’s immersion.It’s been a longtime dream to bring the game to Mac.Marc-Alexis Côté, Ubisoft executive producer“Seeing those millions of lines of code work natively on a Mac was a feeling that’s hard to describe,” Côté says. “When you look at the game’s performance, the curve Apple is on with successive improvements to the M-series chips year after year, and the way the game looks on an HDR screen, you’re like, ‘Is this real?’”Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a balance of the technical and creative. For the former, associate technical director Mathieu Belanger says the capabilities of Mac laid the groundwork for technical success. “The architecture of the hardware is so well done, thanks in part to the unified memory between the GPU and CPU. That made us think the future is bright for gaming on the platform. So many things about doing this on Mac were great right out of the box.”Naoe’s counterpart, Yasuke, prefers the use of brute force.On the creative side, Ubisoft creative director Jonathan Dumont focused on a different opportunity. “The important thing was: Does this feel right? Is it what we want to send to players? And the answer was yes.”The creative team’s goal was nothing short of “making this world feel alive,” says Martin Bedard, a 20-year Ubisoft veteran who served as the game’s technology director (and is very good at playing as Naoe). “You’re put into a moment that really existed,” he says. “This story is your playground.”There are also fluffy kittens. We’ll get to those.The ever-changing seasons lend an incredible variety to the game’s environments.And there’s tremendous power behind the beauty, because the game’s biomes, seasons, weather, and lighting are all dynamic creations. The sunset hour bathes the mountains in soft purple light; the sun’s rays float in through leaves and temple roofs. Pretty much every room has a candle in it, which means the light is always changing. “Look at the clouds here,” says Bedard, pointing at the screen. “That’s not a rendering. These are all fluid-based cloud simulations.”“Japan feels like it’s 80 percent trees and mountains,” says Dumont. “If you’re building this world without the rain, and the winds, and the mountains, it doesn’t feel right.”Wherever you are, wherever you go, everything is beautiful and alive.Mathieu Belanger, associate technical directorAnd those winds? “We developed a lot of features that were barely possible before, and one of them was a full simulation of the wind, not just an animation,” says Belanger. “We even built a humidity simulation that gathers clouds together.” For the in-game seasons, Ubisoft developed an engine that depicted houses, markets, and temples, in ever-changing conditions. “This was all done along the way over the past four years,” he says.To pursue historical accuracy, Dumont and the creative team visited Japan to study every detail, including big-picture details (like town maps) to very specific ones (like the varnish that would have been applied to 16th-century wood). It wasn’t always a slam dunk, says Côté: In one visit, their Japanese hosts recommended a revision to the light splashing against the mountains. “We want to get all those little details right,” he says.

It’s eminently customizable, both from a game-progression standpoint but also in terms of aesthetics. Where the battle scenes are a frenzy of bruising combat or stealth attacks, the Hideout is a refuge for supplies, artwork, found objects, and even a furry menagerie of cats, dogs, deer, and other calming influences. “There are progressions, of course,” says Dumont, “but it’s peaceful. You can say, ‘I feel like putting some trees down, seeing what I collected, upgrading my buildings, and petting the cats.”“The kittens were a P1 feature,” laughs associate game director Dany St-Laurent.Yasuke prepares to face off against an opponent in what will likely be a fruitful battle.Yet for all those big numbers, Dumont says the game boils down to something much simpler. “I just think the characters work super-well together,” he says. “It’s an open-world game, yes. But at its core, it features two characters you’ll like. And the game is really about following their journey, connecting with them, exploring their unique mysteries, and seeing how they flow together. And I think the way in which they join forces is one of the best moments in the franchise.”And if the Ubisoft team has its way, there will be plenty more moments to come. “I think the game will scale for years to come on the Mac platform,” says Côté. “Games can be more and more immersive with each new hardware release. We’re trying to create something here where more people can come with day-one games on the Mac, because I think it’s a beautiful platform.”Pre-order Assassin's Creed Shadows from the Mac App Store",

You can say, ‘I feel like putting some trees down, seeing what I collected, upgrading my buildings, and petting the cats.’\u003c/p\u003e\u003ccite\u003e\u003cp\u003eJonathan Dumont, Ubisoft creative director\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhich brings us to the Hideout, Naoe and Yasuke’s home base and a bucolic rural village that acts as a zen-infused respite from the ferocity of battle. “It’s a place that welcomes you back,” says Dumont. It’s eminently customizable, both from a game-progression standpoint but also in terms of aesthetics. Where the battle scenes are a frenzy of bruising combat or stealth attacks, the Hideout is a refuge for supplies, artwork, found objects, and even a furry menagerie of cats, dogs, deer, and other calming influences. “There are progressions, of course,” says Dumont, “but it’s peaceful. You can say, ‘I feel like putting some trees down, seeing what I collected, upgrading my buildings, and petting the cats.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The kittens were a P1 feature,” laughs associate game director Dany St-Laurent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/CDC4E65A-25EA-4911-92C0-43F5410386D9/2048.jpeg\" data-img-dark=\"https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/wwdc-services/articles/images/CDC4E65A-25EA-4911-92C0-43F5410386D9/2048.jpeg\" data-hires=\"false\" alt=\"In this screenshot from Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Yasuke prepares to take on an opponent in an outdoor market.\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYasuke prepares to face off against an opponent in what will likely be a fruitful battle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet for all those big numbers, Dumont says the game boils down to something much simpler. “I just think the characters work super-well together,” he says. “It’s an open-world game, yes. But at its core, it features two characters you’ll like. And the game is really about following their journey, connecting with them, exploring their unique mysteries, and seeing how they flow together. And I think the way in which they join forces is one of the best moments in the franchise.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd if the Ubisoft team has its way, there will be plenty more moments to come. “I think the game will scale for years to come on the Mac platform,” says Côté. “Games can be more and more immersive with each new hardware release. We’re trying to create something here where more people can come with day-one games on the Mac, because I think it’s a beautiful platform.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/assassins-creed-shadows/id6497794841?mt=12\"\u003ePre-order Assassin\u0026#39;s Creed Shadows from the Mac App Store\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/article\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
