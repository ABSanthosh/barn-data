The Action Button set out to replace the mute switch, which had existed since the first iPhone was released back in 2007. The Action Button is a software-powered button, replacing what previously was a hardware switch that would toggle your phone’s silent mode on or off. The appeal of the Action Button was that now you could decide what the side button should do for you. If you wanted it to be a mute switch, no problem, the Action Button can still be one. But if you want to use it to toggle your flashlight, launch the camera, or turn on Do Not Disturb mode, these alternatives and more are now possible. The unspoken downside has always been that it’s hard to decide what the Action Button should do, if it can only do one thing.",

    "link": "https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=sqd5xv4n",
    "description": "Ask Jason Toff whether his Apple Design Award winner is a game or an app, and his answer is yes.“There’s no one-sentence description for Rooms, and that can be a blessing,” laughs Toff, CEO and head designer of Things, Inc. “It’s not entirely a game, and it’s not entirely a tool. It’s more like a toy.”It’s also a blank canvas, cozy game, coding teacher, and social network — but we’re getting ahead of ourselves. At its heart, Rooms is a collection of user-generated 3-D spaces that feels like the open-ended world of the early internet. Start with an empty room or existing template, then fill it with an array of voxel decorations, items, pets, and avatars to create whatever space you like: a college apartment, medieval castle chamber, floating fantasy realm, pirate ship, or a Weezer concert (really), to name just a few. The only limits are the room’s boundaries — and Rooms fans have even gotten around those. “Our 404 page is a room with no walls,” Toff says, “so people just started copying it to work around the constraint.”ADA FACT SHEETRooms Winner: Visuals and Graphics Team: Things, Inc. Available on: iOS, iPadOS Team size: 4 Learn more about RoomsDownload Rooms from the App StoreIn fact, that community element is a strong point: This creative tapestry of quirky games, tranquil havens, and clever ideas has been conjured by real people, which makes Rooms a social network as well. What’s more, users can click on each item to reveal its underlying code, offering them more options for customization.To create Rooms — which, incidentally, won the ADA for Visuals and Graphics in games — Toff and cofounders Nick Kruge and Bruno Oliveira threw themselves back into their childhoods. “I was obsessed with Legos as a kid,” says Toff, not unexpectedly. “I found myself wondering, ‘What’s the digital equivalent of that?’” Rooms isn’t just about rooms; creators have plenty of ways to noodle on their ideas.Drawing on that inspiration — as well as Toff’s experiences with Kid Pix on his dad’s 1989-era Mac — the Rooms team began envisioning something that, as Oliveira says, kept the floor low but the ceiling high. “We wanted anyone from 4-year-olds to their grandparents to be able to use Rooms,” he says, “and that meant making something free-form and creative.”It also meant building something that gave a sense of approachability and creativity, which led them right to voxels. “Blocks have a charm, but they can also be kind of ugly,” Toff laughs. “Luckily, Bruno’s were cute and soft, so they felt approachable and familiar.” And from Oliveira’s side, blocks offered a practical value. “It’s much easier to do 3-D modeling with blocks,” says Oliveira. “You can just add or remove voxels whenever you want, which lowers the bar for everyone.” We wanted anyone from 4-year-olds to their grandparents to be able to use Rooms, and that meant making something free-form and creative.Jason Toff, CEO and head designer of Things, Inc.Rooms launched in 2023 as a web-based app that included 1,000 voxel objects and allowed users to write their own code. It gained traction through both word of mouth and, more directly, a video that went viral in the cozy-gaming community. “All of a sudden, we had all these people coming,” says Oliveira, “and we realized we needed to prioritize the mobile app. Nick was like, ‘I think we can get feature parity with desktop on the iPhone screen,’ and we basically pulled a rabbit out of a hat.” Today, the vast majority of Rooms users are on mobile, where they spend the bulk of their time editing. “We were just shocked by how much time people were spending making rooms,” he says. “These weren’t quick five-minute projects. We did not anticipate that.”Of course the Things, Inc. team rebuilt their own offices in Rooms.All that building fed into a social aspect as well. Toff says most of the items in Rooms are now created, edited, and amplified by lots of different users. “Here’s a good example: We have a sway effect that makes things wave back and forth a little,” he says. “Someone realized that if they put some branches on a tree and added that effect, the tree immediately looked alive. Now everyone’s doing that. There’s a real additive effect to building in Rooms.” Today, the Rooms library contains more than 10,000 items.There’s a lot of power under the hood, too. “Rooms uses a Lua scripting language that runs in a C++ context,” says Oliveira, “so it’s kind of Lua, encased in C++, encased in Unity, encased in iOS.” Every room, he says, is a new Unity instance. And adding native iOS elements — like sliders on the Explore page and a bottom navigation — gives what he calls the “design chef’s kiss.”An early sketch of Rooms shows how the room design came together early in the process.Like its community, the Rooms team is used to moving fast. “One day I said, ‘It would be cool if this had a D-pad and A/B buttons,” says Toff, “and about 10 hours later Bruno was like, ‘Here you go.’” On another lark, Toff mentioned that it would be fun to let users fly around their rooms, and Kruge and Oliveira promptly created a “camera mode” that’s come to be known internally as the “Jason-Cam.”That’s satisfying to a team that simply set out to build a cutting-edge plaything. “We always had this metaphor that Rooms was a swimming pool with a shallow side and a deep side,” says Oliveira. “It should be fun for people dabbling in the shallow side. But it should also be amazing for people swimming in the deep end. If you just want to look at rooms, you can. But you can also dive all the way down and write complicated code. There’s something for everyone.”Meet the 2024 Apple Design Award winnersBehind the Design is a series that explores design practices and philosophies from finalists and winners of the Apple Design Awards.

ASO refers to being strategic about how you assemble your app's store listing (keywords, name, subtitle, description, screenshots, etc) so that it ranks well when people search for keywords related to your app. In many cases what you actually want to do is avoid popular keywords in the beginning, focusing on less popular ones where you have more of a fighting chance until you get \"popular\" enough that you can try challenging the real ones. How and when you ask for reviews also plays a big role here as reviews also affect your app's rank. I strongly recommend Appfigures for learning and applying ASO for your apps. The owner, Ariel, has posted many videos explaining different strategies you can take, and that's how I got to know about it. In my case, ASO was only time-intensive in the first few weeks following the app's launch. After it picked up some steam and became no.1 in a couple of important keywords, I was able to leave it alone and enjoy full organic growth ever since. I'm my app's primary user Most indie apps fail because they are trying to solve problems that don't exist. The devs come up with the solution first, and then try to find users who have a problem that match their solution. This rarely works. The easiest way to avoid this is to ignore other people and just focus on your own set of problems. If you can manage to build something that would make your own life better, certainly you'll find other people who will also appreciate it. In my case, I built Burnout Buddy because iOS's default Screen Time feature was too simple for me. I wanted to make more complex scenarios such as schedule or location based conditions, but iOS only allows you to setup simple time limits. You also can't do \"strict\" conditions where there's no way to disable the block once it goes into effect. I searched for other alternatives, but none of them were good enough for me. So I built my own! Once my problem was solved, I figured out that most likely there were others out there who could also make use of it. I made the app public with zero expectations, and sure enough, there were tons of other people with the same problem I had. Being my app's primary user also means that I'm perfectly positioned to know which features the app should and shouldn't have. I don't need things like user interviews, because again, I built this for myself. All I have to do is ask myself what I'd like the app to do, and the result is sure to also be a hit with others with the same problem the app aims to solve. I attribute Pieter Level's Make book for helping me understand this concept. It's also a great resource for learning more about indie development and how to create successful products in general! No backend, everything happens client-side Another decision that I've made that massively simplified things for me is that everything happens on the client. There are no accounts or backend, and I gather zero data from the users. This means I have no backend to manage, and most importantly, no monthly server costs. As long as Apple doesn't push iOS updates that break the APIs I use (unfortunately happens a lot), I can trust that everything is working as it should and focus my attention on other things. People seem to really appreciate this too, since many apps nowadays have accounts for no reason other than wanting to hoard data which is really shady. The app just works After the first couple of releases, I spent a good amount of time building a good suite of tests and architecting the app so that it would be easy to expand and make it even more testable. This means I very rarely have to worry about whether or not I'll push something that will fundamentally break the app. Having no backend-related code also greatly helped here. This doesn't mean that the app is bug-free (there are a bunch of SwiftUI issues I can't seem to solve, and Apple somehow manages to break their APIs on every iOS release as mentioned above), but when it comes to the core experience of the app, I can trust that everything works as it should. This saved a lot of testing / debugging time on my end and also made sure I almost never had to deal with support e-mails regarding broken features and such. I don't extort my users Burnout Buddy is a one-time $9.99 bucks purchase. For a long time it used to be $4.99 even. Why this matters? Because most alternatives are stupidly expensive subscriptions. Most of them also don't have backends and have even less features than BB, why the hell are these apps subscription-based??? Some people justify that subscriptions are necessary even for \"simple\" apps like BB because of things like recurring support work. While I can see the point, I also think there are other ways to tackle these issues. I for example created a FAQ support page, and that reduced 99.9% of the support requests. I'm not trying to extort my users and I believe this was a strong factor for the app's success. Things that didn't help It would be naive of me to claim that everything went right. I've made a couple of bad decisions that worked against the app's success, and I wanted to document them as well. Thinking I could make it big without marketing Like I mentioned in the ASO section, it doesn't matter how good your app is. You need to get the word out, otherwise it will just not work. There is a saying in tech that goes \"if you build something good, people will follow\". Whoever said this has absolutely never attempted to sell something. I'm as a tech nerd as it can get and I can safely say that when it comes to building businesses, marketing is a billion times more important than building the actual product! Unfortunately for me, I hate doing marketing work. I'm fine with putting a sponsorship section on this blog, but reaching out to journalists and hustling on X / LinkedIn is really not my thing. This means that while thankfully I was able to do just enough of it to get some nice results in the beginning, the app is destined to die a slow death as it drops in ranking in the App Store and other similar apps manage to get their word out better than me. Marketing is something you have to do constantly, but unfortunately for me it's something I just don't want to do, so there will always be a hard cap to how far I can go with any given project alone. Making the app too cheap This will sound weird because I mentioned above that not extorting my users was a positive. But allow me to clarify this. One thing I've learned the hard way is that you need to avoid cheapskates like the plague. This means people who expect nothing but the highest quality products, but at the same time are not willing to pay anything for it. You know when you see one because they behave like huge assholes and will do everything in their power to extract as much value from you as possible while giving nothing in return, much like the meme of a Karen screaming at the supermarket cashier because of some worthless coupon. When Burnout Buddy was $4.99, I was constantly having my support e-mail being spammed by such people. They would constantly aggressively complain about different app features and demand refunds, often threatening that they would download a different app if I didn't help them (...why would I care about that?). A lot of these reports didn't even make sense, they were clearly people just searching for excuses to be an asshole and get free stuff. It was such a waste of my time that I even briefly considered abandoning the project entirely / pulling it from the App Store just so I wouldn't have to deal with them anymore. It was only when I read someone complaining about the exact same problem on HackerNews that I realized what my issue was. It's not that giving support is a thankless job, it's that the app was too cheap. The cheapskates are attracted by free (or in this case, almost free) products. If you raise the price of your product just slightly, you can filter out these people without driving way the good (and kind) users. After doing just that, these bizarre e-mails completely vanished without resulting in any loss of revenue. While I of course still get support requests every now and then, they are now all very polite and helpful, which makes everything a breeze! In other words, the \"fail\" here is that I should've made the app cost $9.99 from the get-go to have filtered the cheapskates from the very beginning. Not gathering analytics This is an interesting one because it's both a good and a bad thing depending on how you look at it. I mentioned above that having no accounts was a good thing because it made things easier on my side and was appreciated by the users. But it also meant that I had no information regarding how users were using the app. This made things harder for me because 1) I couldn't determine which features were more popular / worth expanding upon (and which ones weren't), and 2) when people reported bugs, I had no easy way to trace their steps in order to quickly reproduce the issue (or to confirm they misunderstood the app / were doing something wrong). If I could go back, I would probably have gone for a solution that allowed me to gather analytics data for the above reasons. Using SwiftUI This is mostly out-of-topic for this post, so I'll keep it short. I decided to use SwiftUI for this project as a learning opportunity, and I sort of regret it. As mentioned in my SwiftUI vs UIKit post, SwiftUI is good for simple apps, but awful for more complex ones. As BB grew and became more intricate, SwiftUI became more and more of an issue. The app today is full of dirty hacks and visual bugs that are impossible to solve (as of writing) because they originate from SwiftUI itself, in ways that are impossible for me to control without dumping the entire framework.",

    "link": "https://swiftrocks.com/my-home-automation-setup",
    "description": "I recently upgraded my smart home hardware, and I felt like writing a post describing my current setup to serve as inspiration for those wanting to get started or just interested in home automation in general. The Software I use Home Assistant OS like many others. The way I like to describe HA is that it's an Alexa on steroids. With an Alexa, you buy smart devices, link them with the Alexa, and then setup automations to control those devices based on conditions like time, weather, and so on. But the problem with Alexas is that 1) the devices must support Alexas specifically, and 2) the automations themselves are very limited, only allowing you to do simple things. Home Assistant doesn't have such limitations. HA is open-source and has a thriving community, meaning you can find plugins that enable integrations for pretty much anything you can think of, and if you don't, you can build such plugins yourself assuming you have the programming chops to do it! HA is very extensible, and thus perfect for power users who want to set up complex automations or integrate unusual devices in unusual ways. The Hardware For a long time, my setup used to be a simple Raspberry Pi 3b and a SD card. The HA community tells you that this is a bad idea (The 3b is weak and SD cards can die if you use them too much), but in my experience this is fine as long as you don't have too many devices / automations / integrations. It's a good starting point, and it did the trick for me for a couple of years until I started wanting to do more complicated integrations. Nowadays, I've retired the 3b in favor of a Raspberry Pi 5 w/ 8GB RAM, with a 256GB official RPi NVMe SSD and enclosed on the Argon One V3 case. This gives HA enough power and cooling to do everything that I need with ease. The way I run the server is via WiFi. The community says that this is also a bad idea and that you should use a wired connection to prevent latency issues, but I never had any such issues running HA via WiFi. For voice control, I use an Alexa. The way this works is that HA has a plugin called Emulated Hue which allows you to trick an Alexa into thinking your HA server is a Philips Hue hub, allowing you to expose your devices and scripts to the Alexa in order to make use of its voice features. But you can also pay for HA Cloud and enjoy the official \"proper\" Alexa integration, which I don't because I want to keep everything running on the local network. I also have a Sonoff ZBDongle-E USB stick plugged into the server in order to drive my Zigbee devices, which I'll mention in more detail further below. The Protocol Currently, I'm running a combination of WiFi and Zigbee devices, which is an alternate wireless protocol made specifically to be used by IoT devices that uses less energy and lays off a mesh network where the devices communicate with each other (as opposed to WiFi devices where everything goes through the router, thus creating a star network). The reason I run this mix is just because I didn't know about Zigbee in the beginning. If I could go back in time, I would have the entire network consist of Zigbee devices because I think they are just better than WiFi ones overall. It uses significantly less energy (many Zigbee devices can run on those coin cell batteries), the mesh network allows you to have devices very far away from the server, and best of all: they work even when the WiFi is down. When you buy Zigbee devices, usually the store will say that you need a hub to drive them, which they also sell. It's true that you need a hub, but it doesn't have to be that store's specific hub. When using something like HA, you can use a USB antenna stick like the one mentioned above and that will allow you to control any Zigbee device from any manufacturer via HA. The Devices Here are the IoT devices that I have around my apartment, excluding things that are \"smart\" by default like TVs and such. Sonoff Basic R2 (WiFi) This is a DIY WiFi switch that you hook into \"dumb\" devices in order to be able to make them smart and turn them on and off via WiFi. Given a bit of skill with electronics (stripping / crimping wires), these switches are much cheaper and more durable compared to buying smart lamps, and I have many of these spread around the apartment! By default, these require you to expose your device to some awful Chinese cloud server. Luckily for us, you can flash these devices with custom firmware like Tasmota, allowing you to have full control of them. This also requires skills with electronics and some special equipment, so keep that in mind. As previously mentioned, If I could go back in time, I would have instead bought these switches' Zigbee equivalent to make things easier and better, so I'm in the process of replacing them. Sonoff S26 R2 (WiFi) This is the same as above, but as something that you plug directly into the wall socket, thus requiring no messing with wires unless you want to flash the firmware to stop China from spying on you. If I could back in time, I would have bought these IKEA wall sockets instead, as they run on Zigbee and can even provide data on your electrical consumption, so these are also something I'll be replacing soon. Broadlink RM4C mini This is a WiFi IR blaster that you can configure IR commands and thus be able to create automations that allow you to control devices that require a remote control, like your TV. In my case it turned out that newer Samsung TVs have some sort of API integration where you can control them over the web, but I used these blasters for a long time before I discovered this. This also puts your device on some Chinese cloud though, and in this case I'm not sure if custom firmwares are available. Random IKEA IoT utilities IKEA has lots of IoT devices like buttons, remote controls, motion detectors, temperature thingies, and more. They are all Zigbee and thus very easy to connect to use. I think only the button and the remote control took a bit more effort because you need to find out exactly how they work in order to build automations against them in HA, but nothing that a simple Google search couldn't solve.",

    "title": "SwiftUI Keyboard Shortcut Scope",
    "link": "https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swiftui-keyboard-shortcut-scope/",
    "description": "A SwiftUI keyboard shortcut remains active as long as the control it’s attached to is still in the view hierarchy, even when not onscreen. Adding Keyboard Shortcuts SwiftUI added The .keyboardShortcut modifier in iOS 14. You apply the modifier to a control. The keyboard shortcut performs the primary action of the control. The shortcut defaults to using the command modifier but you can change that: .keyboardShortcut(\"D\", modifiers: [.control, .option]) Here’s an example of navigation from a root to detail view with keyboard shortcuts applied to the buttons: struct ContentView: View { @State private var isPresented: Bool = false var body: some View { NavigationStack { VStack(spacing: 16) { Button(\"Detail\") { isPresented = true } .keyboardShortcut(\"D\") Button(\"New\") { ... } .keyboardShortcut(\"N\") } .navigationTitle(\"Title\") .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline) .navigationDestination(isPresented: $isPresented) { Button(\"Edit\") { ... } .keyboardShortcut(\"E\") .navigationTitle(\"Detail\") } } } } A command-N on the root view performs the new button action. A command-D performs the detail button action triggering a navigation to the detail view. On the detail view, command-E performs the edit button action. Keyboard Shortcut Scope What’s surprising to me is that the command-N and command-D keyboard shortcuts are still active on the detail view. You can see this when holding down the command key to view the available keyboard shortcuts. Here’s the available shortcuts from the root view: If I navigate to the detail view, the new and detail button are no longer onscreen but their shortcuts still show up and trigger their actions: What’s Happening? From the documentation: The target of a keyboard shortcut is resolved in a leading-to-trailing, depth-first traversal of one or more view hierarchies. On macOS, the system looks in the key window first, then the main window, and then the command groups; on other platforms, the system looks in the active scene, and then the command groups. So the system searches for the first control associated with the shortcut in the window/scene view hierarchy. It doesn’t matter if the control is offscreen. I can see situations where you might want a shortcut to trigger when the control is offscreen but it’s not what I want here. Workaround The best workaround I’ve been able to come up with is to disable controls when I don’t want the shortcut to be active. In this example, I can use the isPresented state to disable the new and detail commands when I’m presenting the detail view: Button(\"Detail\") { isPresented = true } .keyboardShortcut(\"D\") .disabled(isPresented) Button(\"New\") { ... } .keyboardShortcut(\"N\") .disabled(isPresented) See also this comment from Curt Clifton SwiftUI Keyboard Shortcut Scope was originally posted 07 Apr 2025 on useyourloaf.com.

    "title": "SwiftUI Accessibility Language",
    "link": "https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swiftui-accessibility-language/",
    "description": "How do you change the accessibility language used by VoiceOver with SwiftUI? What’s The Problem? If you’re working on any sort of language learning application you might want a view showing text in two different languages: struct ContentView: View { private let english = \"Good morning\" private let italian = \"Buongiorno\" var body: some View { VStack(spacing: 8) { Text(english) .font(.headline) Text(italian) .font(.subheadline) } .frame(width:300, height: 200) .background(Color.yellow) } } This causes a problem for VoiceOver when it speaks the two lines of text. By default, VoiceOver speaks with the user’s locale. If my device is using an English locale it pronounces “Good morning” fine but sounds ridiculous when attempting “Buongiorno”. I want VoiceOver to use an English pronunciation for the former and an Italian one for the latter. Accessibility Language If I was using UIKit I’d set the accessibilityLanguage property on the text labels to override the language VoiceOver uses when speaking: englishLabel.accessibilityLanguage = \"en\" italianLabel.accessibilityLanguage = \"it\" Unfortunately, there’s no such view modifier in SwiftUI. So how do I change the language VoiceOver uses when working with a SwiftUI view? One suggestion I’ve seen is to use AttributedString which does have an .accessibilitySpeechLanguage attribute: private let italian = AttributedString( \"Buongiorno\", attributes: AttributeContainer([ .accessibilitySpeechLanguage: \"it\" ]) ) That doesn’t work for me. Changing the Locale A tip on Mastodon from Łukasz Rutkowski suggested changing the locale environment for each view: Text(english) .font(.headline) .environment(\\.locale, .init(identifier: \"en\")) Text(italian) .font(.subheadline) .environment(\\.locale, .init(identifier: \"it\")) That didn’t work until I realised the Text view was treating the text as a localized string key. I never want to localize those values. Using the verbatim initializer for the Text view fixed the problem: Text(verbatim: english) .font(.headline) .environment(\\.locale, .init(identifier: \"en\")) Text(verbatim: italian) .font(.subheadline) .environment(\\.locale, .init(identifier: \"it\")) VoiceOver now pronounces the English text in English and the Italian text in Italian. Label and Button The need to use a verbatim String does force you to use the longer form for views like a Label: Label { Text(verbatim: italian) } icon: { Image(systemName: \"globe\") } .environment(\\.locale, .init(identifier: \"it\")) You can apply the locale to the label or the child text view. A Button works the same way if I use a Text view for the label: Button { } label: { Text(verbatim: italian) .environment(\\.locale, .init(identifier: \"it\")) } However, if I use a Label to include an icon the locale only takes effect when applied to the Button. It’s ignored when applied to the child Label or Text view: Button { } label: { Label { Text(verbatim: italian) } icon: { Image(systemName: \"globe\") } } .environment(\\.locale, .init(identifier: \"it\")) That does mean VoiceOver pronounces “button” in the modified locale (in the above case I hear “Buongiorno, pulsante”) but I can live with that.
