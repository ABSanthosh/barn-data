    "link": "https://swiftrocks.com/things-that-did-and-didnt-contribute-to-burnout-buddys-success",
    "description": "Back in 2022 I launched Burnout Buddy, and today the app has succeeded far beyond my expectations. Netting between $600 and $1000 each month as of writing, BB has been growing 100% organically with little to no effort on my part. In this post, I'd like to lay out exactly what I've done that I believe contributed (and didn't contribute) to this growth, serving as documentation and inspiration for the indie dev community out there. Things that helped Understanding ASO I cannot understate the value of having a good grasp of App Store Optimization (ASO). The case is simple: It doesn't matter how good your app is, if you don't get eyes on it, it will never succeed. ASO refers to being strategic about how you assemble your app's store listing (keywords, name, subtitle, description, screenshots, etc) so that it ranks well when people search for keywords related to your app. In many cases what you actually want to do is avoid popular keywords in the beginning, focusing on less popular ones where you have more of a fighting chance until you get \"popular\" enough that you can try challenging the real ones. How and when you ask for reviews also plays a big role here as reviews also affect your app's rank. I strongly recommend Appfigures for learning and applying ASO for your apps. The owner, Ariel, has posted many videos explaining different strategies you can take, and that's how I got to know about it. In my case, ASO was only time-intensive in the first few weeks following the app's launch. After it picked up some steam and became no.1 in a couple of important keywords, I was able to leave it alone and enjoy full organic growth ever since. I'm my app's primary user Most indie apps fail because they are trying to solve problems that don't exist. The devs come up with the solution first, and then try to find users who have a problem that match their solution. This rarely works. The easiest way to avoid this is to ignore other people and just focus on your own set of problems. If you can manage to build something that would make your own life better, certainly you'll find other people who will also appreciate it. In my case, I built Burnout Buddy because iOS's default Screen Time feature was too simple for me. I wanted to make more complex scenarios such as schedule or location based conditions, but iOS only allows you to setup simple time limits. You also can't do \"strict\" conditions where there's no way to disable the block once it goes into effect. I searched for other alternatives, but none of them were good enough for me. So I built my own! Once my problem was solved, I figured out that most likely there were others out there who could also make use of it. I made the app public with zero expectations, and sure enough, there were tons of other people with the same problem I had. Being my app's primary user also means that I'm perfectly positioned to know which features the app should and shouldn't have. I don't need things like user interviews, because again, I built this for myself. All I have to do is ask myself what I'd like the app to do, and the result is sure to also be a hit with others with the same problem the app aims to solve. I attribute Pieter Level's Make book for helping me understand this concept. It's also a great resource for learning more about indie development and how to create successful products in general! No backend, everything happens client-side Another decision that I've made that massively simplified things for me is that everything happens on the client. There are no accounts or backend, and I gather zero data from the users. This means I have no backend to manage, and most importantly, no monthly server costs. As long as Apple doesn't push iOS updates that break the APIs I use (unfortunately happens a lot), I can trust that everything is working as it should and focus my attention on other things. People seem to really appreciate this too, since many apps nowadays have accounts for no reason other than wanting to hoard data which is really shady. The app just works After the first couple of releases, I spent a good amount of time building a good suite of tests and architecting the app so that it would be easy to expand and make it even more testable. This means I very rarely have to worry about whether or not I'll push something that will fundamentally break the app. Having no backend-related code also greatly helped here. This doesn't mean that the app is bug-free (there are a bunch of SwiftUI issues I can't seem to solve, and Apple somehow manages to break their APIs on every iOS release as mentioned above), but when it comes to the core experience of the app, I can trust that everything works as it should. This saved a lot of testing / debugging time on my end and also made sure I almost never had to deal with support e-mails regarding broken features and such. I don't extort my users Burnout Buddy is a one-time $9.99 bucks purchase. For a long time it used to be $4.99 even. Why this matters? Because most alternatives are stupidly expensive subscriptions. Most of them also don't have backends and have even less features than BB, why the hell are these apps subscription-based??? Some people justify that subscriptions are necessary even for \"simple\" apps like BB because of things like recurring support work. While I can see the point, I also think there are other ways to tackle these issues. I for example created a FAQ support page, and that reduced 99.9% of the support requests. I'm not trying to extort my users and I believe this was a strong factor for the app's success. Things that didn't help It would be naive of me to claim that everything went right. I've made a couple of bad decisions that worked against the app's success, and I wanted to document them as well. Thinking I could make it big without marketing Like I mentioned in the ASO section, it doesn't matter how good your app is. You need to get the word out, otherwise it will just not work. There is a saying in tech that goes \"if you build something good, people will follow\". Whoever said this has absolutely never attempted to sell something. I'm as a tech nerd as it can get and I can safely say that when it comes to building businesses, marketing is a billion times more important than building the actual product! Unfortunately for me, I hate doing marketing work. I'm fine with putting a sponsorship section on this blog, but reaching out to journalists and hustling on X / LinkedIn is really not my thing. This means that while thankfully I was able to do just enough of it to get some nice results in the beginning, the app is destined to die a slow death as it drops in ranking in the App Store and other similar apps manage to get their word out better than me. Marketing is something you have to do constantly, but unfortunately for me it's something I just don't want to do, so there will always be a hard cap to how far I can go with any given project alone. Making the app too cheap This will sound weird because I mentioned above that not extorting my users was a positive. But allow me to clarify this. One thing I've learned the hard way is that you need to avoid cheapskates like the plague. This means people who expect nothing but the highest quality products, but at the same time are not willing to pay anything for it. You know when you see one because they behave like huge assholes and will do everything in their power to extract as much value from you as possible while giving nothing in return, much like the meme of a Karen screaming at the supermarket cashier because of some worthless coupon. When Burnout Buddy was $4.99, I was constantly having my support e-mail being spammed by such people. They would constantly aggressively complain about different app features and demand refunds, often threatening that they would download a different app if I didn't help them (...why would I care about that?). A lot of these reports didn't even make sense, they were clearly people just searching for excuses to be an asshole and get free stuff. It was such a waste of my time that I even briefly considered abandoning the project entirely / pulling it from the App Store just so I wouldn't have to deal with them anymore. It was only when I read someone complaining about the exact same problem on HackerNews that I realized what my issue was. It's not that giving support is a thankless job, it's that the app was too cheap. The cheapskates are attracted by free (or in this case, almost free) products. If you raise the price of your product just slightly, you can filter out these people without driving way the good (and kind) users. After doing just that, these bizarre e-mails completely vanished without resulting in any loss of revenue. While I of course still get support requests every now and then, they are now all very polite and helpful, which makes everything a breeze! In other words, the \"fail\" here is that I should've made the app cost $9.99 from the get-go to have filtered the cheapskates from the very beginning. Not gathering analytics This is an interesting one because it's both a good and a bad thing depending on how you look at it. I mentioned above that having no accounts was a good thing because it made things easier on my side and was appreciated by the users. But it also meant that I had no information regarding how users were using the app. This made things harder for me because 1) I couldn't determine which features were more popular / worth expanding upon (and which ones weren't), and 2) when people reported bugs, I had no easy way to trace their steps in order to quickly reproduce the issue (or to confirm they misunderstood the app / were doing something wrong). If I could go back, I would probably have gone for a solution that allowed me to gather analytics data for the above reasons. Using SwiftUI This is mostly out-of-topic for this post, so I'll keep it short. I decided to use SwiftUI for this project as a learning opportunity, and I sort of regret it. As mentioned in my SwiftUI vs UIKit post, SwiftUI is good for simple apps, but awful for more complex ones. As BB grew and became more intricate, SwiftUI became more and more of an issue. The app today is full of dirty hacks and visual bugs that are impossible to solve (as of writing) because they originate from SwiftUI itself, in ways that are impossible for me to control without dumping the entire framework.",

    "description": "I recently upgraded my smart home hardware, and I felt like writing a post describing my current setup to serve as inspiration for those wanting to get started or just interested in home automation in general. The Software I use Home Assistant OS like many others. The way I like to describe HA is that it's an Alexa on steroids. With an Alexa, you buy smart devices, link them with the Alexa, and then setup automations to control those devices based on conditions like time, weather, and so on. But the problem with Alexas is that 1) the devices must support Alexas specifically, and 2) the automations themselves are very limited, only allowing you to do simple things. Home Assistant doesn't have such limitations. HA is open-source and has a thriving community, meaning you can find plugins that enable integrations for pretty much anything you can think of, and if you don't, you can build such plugins yourself assuming you have the programming chops to do it! HA is very extensible, and thus perfect for power users who want to set up complex automations or integrate unusual devices in unusual ways. The Hardware For a long time, my setup used to be a simple Raspberry Pi 3b and a SD card. The HA community tells you that this is a bad idea (The 3b is weak and SD cards can die if you use them too much), but in my experience this is fine as long as you don't have too many devices / automations / integrations. It's a good starting point, and it did the trick for me for a couple of years until I started wanting to do more complicated integrations. Nowadays, I've retired the 3b in favor of a Raspberry Pi 5 w/ 8GB RAM, with a 256GB official RPi NVMe SSD and enclosed on the Argon One V3 case. This gives HA enough power and cooling to do everything that I need with ease. The way I run the server is via WiFi. The community says that this is also a bad idea and that you should use a wired connection to prevent latency issues, but I never had any such issues running HA via WiFi. For voice control, I use an Alexa. The way this works is that HA has a plugin called Emulated Hue which allows you to trick an Alexa into thinking your HA server is a Philips Hue hub, allowing you to expose your devices and scripts to the Alexa in order to make use of its voice features. But you can also pay for HA Cloud and enjoy the official \"proper\" Alexa integration, which I don't because I want to keep everything running on the local network. I also have a Sonoff ZBDongle-E USB stick plugged into the server in order to drive my Zigbee devices, which I'll mention in more detail further below. The Protocol Currently, I'm running a combination of WiFi and Zigbee devices, which is an alternate wireless protocol made specifically to be used by IoT devices that uses less energy and lays off a mesh network where the devices communicate with each other (as opposed to WiFi devices where everything goes through the router, thus creating a star network). The reason I run this mix is just because I didn't know about Zigbee in the beginning. If I could go back in time, I would have the entire network consist of Zigbee devices because I think they are just better than WiFi ones overall. It uses significantly less energy (many Zigbee devices can run on those coin cell batteries), the mesh network allows you to have devices very far away from the server, and best of all: they work even when the WiFi is down. When you buy Zigbee devices, usually the store will say that you need a hub to drive them, which they also sell. It's true that you need a hub, but it doesn't have to be that store's specific hub. When using something like HA, you can use a USB antenna stick like the one mentioned above and that will allow you to control any Zigbee device from any manufacturer via HA. The Devices Here are the IoT devices that I have around my apartment, excluding things that are \"smart\" by default like TVs and such. Sonoff Basic R2 (WiFi) This is a DIY WiFi switch that you hook into \"dumb\" devices in order to be able to make them smart and turn them on and off via WiFi. Given a bit of skill with electronics (stripping / crimping wires), these switches are much cheaper and more durable compared to buying smart lamps, and I have many of these spread around the apartment! By default, these require you to expose your device to some awful Chinese cloud server. Luckily for us, you can flash these devices with custom firmware like Tasmota, allowing you to have full control of them. This also requires skills with electronics and some special equipment, so keep that in mind. As previously mentioned, If I could go back in time, I would have instead bought these switches' Zigbee equivalent to make things easier and better, so I'm in the process of replacing them. Sonoff S26 R2 (WiFi) This is the same as above, but as something that you plug directly into the wall socket, thus requiring no messing with wires unless you want to flash the firmware to stop China from spying on you. If I could back in time, I would have bought these IKEA wall sockets instead, as they run on Zigbee and can even provide data on your electrical consumption, so these are also something I'll be replacing soon. Broadlink RM4C mini This is a WiFi IR blaster that you can configure IR commands and thus be able to create automations that allow you to control devices that require a remote control, like your TV. In my case it turned out that newer Samsung TVs have some sort of API integration where you can control them over the web, but I used these blasters for a long time before I discovered this. This also puts your device on some Chinese cloud though, and in this case I'm not sure if custom firmwares are available. Random IKEA IoT utilities IKEA has lots of IoT devices like buttons, remote controls, motion detectors, temperature thingies, and more. They are all Zigbee and thus very easy to connect to use. I think only the button and the remote control took a bit more effort because you need to find out exactly how they work in order to build automations against them in HA, but nothing that a simple Google search couldn't solve.",

    "link": "https://useyourloaf.com/blog/reducing-motion-of-animations/",
    "description": "Reduce or disable animations when the user requests you to reduce motion in the device accessibility settings. What’s the problem? Apple’s Human Interface Guide has some guidelines when applying motion to your user interface: Don’t add motion for the sake of adding motion. Gratuitous or excessive animation can distract people and may make them feel disconnected or physically uncomfortable. They also suggest making motion optional: Not everyone can or wants to experience the motion in your app or game, so it’s essential to avoid using it as the only way to communicate important information. When you do apply motion you need to be aware when it can be problematic for users. Apple highlights a number of situations: Oscillating motions, especially with large amplitudes and frequencies around 0.2 Hz (one oscillation every five seconds). For spatial interfaces like visionOS, head-locked content with rapid camera motion. Large animations that simulate objects flying in or out of the screen. Reduce Motion Accessibility Setting A user can request to reduce the motion of the user interface in the device accessibility settings: The system can take the setting into account when applying standard view transitions (but I’ve not found this documented anywhere). For example, the zoom navigation transition (new in iOS 18) creates the effect of the view flying towards/away from you which can be a problem. That automatically falls back to a standard navigation transition when you choose reduce motion. For custom animations you need to take the appropriate action yourself by disabling or replacing problematic motion. Detecting Reduce Motion The reduce motion setting is available in the environment for SwiftUI views: @Environment(\\.accessibilityReduceMotion) var reduceMotion The documentation offers us a hint on how to react: If this property’s value is true, UI should avoid large animations, especially those that simulate the third dimension. Note: For UIKit, listen for the notification reduceMotionStatusDidChangeNotification. Disabling Animations I find it convenient to create animations as a computed property that takes the reduce motion state into account. For example, to disable the animation: struct MyView: View { @Environment(\\.accessibilityReduceMotion) var reduceMotion private var linearAnimation: Animation? { guard !reduceMotion else { return nil } return Animation.linear(duration: 0.3) } } Then when applying the animation using the computed property. A value of nil disables the animation: .onTapGesture { withAnimation(linearAnimation) { enabled.toggle() } } You don’t have to always disable the animation, as with the zoom transition you could replace an animation with a less problematic version. The point to remember is that it’s not automatic for your own animations. You need to decide when and how to respond.

    "title": "Swift Parameterized Testing",
    "link": "https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swift-parameterized-testing/",
    "description": "Apple introduced Swift Testing at WWDC24. One of the interesting features is the ability to pass arguments to a test function. Parameterized Testing The Swift Testing @Test macro has an arguments parameter which accepts a collection of values: @Test(\"Even Value\", arguments: [2, 8, 50]) func even(value: Int) { #expect(value.isMultiple(of: 2)) } Swift Testing calls the test function once for each value in the arguments collection. The Test Navigator shows the results of each of the test runs: If you pass a second argument, Swift Testing generates test cases for all combinations of the two arguments: @Test(\"Product is even\", arguments: [2, 8, 50], [3, 6, 9]) func productEven(value: Int, multiplier: Int) { let product = value * multiplier #expect(product.isMultiple(of: 2)) } The Test Navigator shows nine test results covering all combinations of the input arguments: You’re limited to at most two arguments. If you don’t need every combination you can zip the arguments to pair them: @Test(\"Product is even\", arguments: zip([2, 8, 50], [3, 6, 9])) func productEven(value: Int, multiplier: Int) { let product = value * multiplier #expect(product.isMultiple(of: 2)) } The Test Navigator now shows this test running three times with consecutive pairs of arguments: That all makes for a good demo but how useful is it in practise? Migrating from XCTest I recently migrated some XCTest based unit tests to Swift Testing. I was happy to find examples where I could use parameters to either combine or simplify tests. The parameter based testing works best when you have a collection of input arguments for which you expect the same result. I’ve found this extra convenient when you can organise the input data as a CaseIterable enum that can drive the tests. For example, I like to verify the attributes of each property in my Core Data managed object classes. This protects me from accidentally renaming or changing the type of the property in the Core Data model editor. I have the attributes of each Core Data class listed as enums organised by type. For example, a Country has these String attributes: enum StringAttribute: String, CaseIterable { case capital case name case continent case currency } A test to verify each of these string attributes: private let entityName = \"Country\" private let container: NSPeristentContainer @Test( \"Verify String attributes\", arguments: Country.StringAttribute.allCases) func stringAttributes(_ name: Country.StringAttribute) throws { let entity = try #require( container.managedObjectModel.entitiesByName[entityName]) let attribute = try #require(entity.attributesByName[name.rawValue]) #expect(attribute.type == .string) } I’m yet to find a practical example for when I need all combinations of two arguments though I have some situations where I’ve found zip’ing two arguments useful. Why Bother? I can write the previous test without arguments using a for-loop to iterate over the enum cases. The Swift Testing approach with parameters has some advantages: Each call of the test function with a different argument is an independent test case than can run in parallel. It’s much clearer when a test case fails. You can also rerun just the failing argument from the test navigator by clicking on the red failure icon: Learn More Migrating XCTest to Swift Testing WWDC24 Go further with Swift Testing Swift Parameterized Testing was originally posted 06 Jan 2025 on useyourloaf.com.
