They must be tired of answering these sorts of questions, but hey, if people are asking the question, there must be demand. Or they are just whining like I have been.Canon’s Executive Vice President and Imaging Group Manager, Tsuyoshi Tokura, responded to queries at the press conference on February 27, the first day of CP+ in Yohohama, Japan.Mr Tsuyoshi TokuraMr Tokura responded in Canon executive-speak to questions about the full-frame release of third-party lenses, “Other companies have begun to release several RF lenses, but we have no knowledge of what types of lenses they will release; we only know that these have been released. We cannot disclose the contents of contracts, such as licenses, to the public. Right now, all I can say is that we are deciding the contents of contracts within our business strategy.”.Last year, Mr Tokura was asked a similar question and responded, “We are communicating with third-party manufacturers. I think we’re more than halfway there in terms of communication (until commercialization).” Later, in 2024, both Sigma and Tamron released RF versions of their APS-C lenses.Sigma’s DC DN lenses are available for the RF mount.After the initial flurry of Tamron and Sigma announcing their APS-C lenses for the RF mount, Samyang announced later in 2024 that its Samyang AF 12mm F2.0 would be coming to the RF mount.Samyang 12mm F2.0 AF for Canon RF-SOne problem that I’m seeing with the way Canon is going around this is that we don’t know who is officially licensed by Canon. I’m going to assume that while Samyang had early versions of their lenses on the RF mount and pulled them off the market with the insistence of Canon, this lens is officially approved by Canon for release on the RF mount.So, while Mr Tokura’s comments may be discouraging, it should be noted that Canon never comes out and directly states something. When you think about it, they really couldn’t. We all know what lenses Sigma and Tamron could port to the RF mount, so it wouldn’t take a brain surgeon to put two and two together if Mr Tokura came out and stated, “Oh yes, two manufacturers are looking to release full-frame lenses soon”, Which could certainly interrupt those companies’ marketing plans for the lenses.If anything, we can note that he didn’t say “no”.So, for now, we can look with a little jealousy at the development announcements of the Sigma 35mm F1.2 DG DN | Art II and hope that Canon and Sigma optimize their relationship and time to market further.I do know one thing personally: I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall during the conversations between Canon and the various third-party lens manufacturers to know what the criteria are and were and just how much Canon is charging these vendors (if anything) to create RF mount lenses.Source: MyNavi NewsWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
