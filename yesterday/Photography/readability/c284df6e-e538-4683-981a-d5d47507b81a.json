They’re all over the place on the South Island and even from the middle of a town or city you’re often only a few minutes from the beginning of a trail that will take you into a beautiful, serene environment where you’ll barely see another human. The paths often cross little streams and regularly pass by lovely waterfalls like this one. Great for popping your shoes off and cooling down some tired feet on the way back.
