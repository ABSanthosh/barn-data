  "description": "We spent 9 days there with the whole family (it was just a vacationâ€”no work) at our kidâ€™s favorite place â€“Â Tokyo, and this was our best trip there yet! I shared some of my favorite shots from the trip using Adobe Express: Hereâ€™s the link if youâ€™ve got a sec. Hope you can stop by and check them out. ðŸ™‚ Right now, Iâ€™m in Vegas My workshop here, with my co-instructor Erik Kuna, kicks off tomorrow, where 12 photographers from all over will get together for a week of learning, laughing, and lunching (not necessarily in that order). Our first stop tonight â€“ is dinner at Carmineâ€™s (the same folks behind the one on W44th and Broadway in NYC), but this oneâ€™s in the Caesarâ€™s Palace Forum Shops. What a great way to kick off the workshop! That all from here â€“Â thanks for letting me share my trip(s) with you! -Scott The post My Favorite Shots From My Tokyo Trip appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",
