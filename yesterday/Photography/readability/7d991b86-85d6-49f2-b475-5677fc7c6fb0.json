Photo by Growtika It has also gotten the attention of massive names like Adobe and Figma. In fact, those two platforms, among others, will be integrating this ChatGPT feature into their workflows going forward, giving millions of users access to some of the most powerful image-generation tools out there.  If this seems like just the beginning, you’re not the only one. We’re not surprised to see this happen, but we thought that these platforms would probably want to have more control over the service (that is, you know, make their own image-generation tools which they are but I guess when you see the best, you know it).  ChatGPT’s blog post about the integration shows off some of the work from the major platforms which include the aforementioned Adobe and Figma as well as Airtable, Gamma, HeyGen, OpusClip, Quora, Wix, Photoroom, and Playground, among others.  And the tool will focus on a unique area for each platform. For example, GoDaddy will be taking advantage of the logo-generating abilities of the platform to help its users create easy, editable logos, ChatGPT writes.  Interestingly, one use case that is listed is Instacart which, unlike the others, will be used to help generate shopping lists and suggested recipes for customers which gives us all some idea of the depth and breadth of possible uses for ChatGPT’s AI.  Naturally, how it got this talent this fast continues to be a source of debate, particularly in Japan if you missed our story from earlier this week.  Have you tried out ChatGPT’s image generation tool? Let us know your thoughts on it in the comments.  We have some more news for you to read at this link.
