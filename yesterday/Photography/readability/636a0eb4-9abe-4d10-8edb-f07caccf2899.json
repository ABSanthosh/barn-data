There aren’t may publications or reviewers out there that take their time with a product for reasons that one could consider obvious.One publication that we do love here at Canon Rumors is ePHOTOzine. Their reviews are always extremely thorough, appear for the most part to be unbiased and tend to hit how the market eventually ends up feeling about a product.We always look back on Roger’s Law of New Product Introduction, which has been and will always be true.If you’re looking into the Canon EOS R5 Mark II as your next camera sometime down the road, this is probably one of the reviews you should read in full to help with your purchasing decisionsIt’ll be worthwhile for those DSLR shooters that haven’t made the move to mirrorless yet, and there are a lot of you out there, or others that haven’t decided if they want to move on from an R6 or R5 series camera, or even R3 shooters that want some more resolution and the latest and great autofocus performance.Canon EOS R5 Mark IIThere’s also the question of saving a pile of money and just buying the Canon EOS R5 instead?John Riley does a thorough review of the camera and doesn’t really have many negative things to say about it, beyond it’s $4299 USD pricepoint. In the USA at least, as we’re already seeing refurbished EOS R5 Mark II cameras being offered just over $400 below retail, along with a few discount programs, such as the B\u0026H Photo Winter Trade-in Event.The rest of the planet? It’s still a camera that can be hard to come by and we haven’t seen any movement on price at this time, though we can’t know pricing at every retailer.One knock on the EOS R5 Mark II from John, and it’s a minor one for a lot of people, is that cold performance is officially limited to 0c. Which I think is just Canon simply protecting themselves with things like warranty costs and battery performance.Canon also uses LCD screens on the back of the camera, and at a certain temperature, they will freeze dead. So it’s best to just not use them and turn the screen around, which may help keep it a bit warmer from the camera heat. I didn’t keep track of what the temperature was, or how long it took for the LCD to die.The OLED EVF won’t have any issues operating in cold temperatures, at least I haven’t been somewhere cold enough to cause an issue.The LCD screens will thaw and come back to full functionality.Frozen and Still Working Canon EOS R3 – Rated to 0CThere is also the issue of acclimating cameras and lenses properly, which can cause failure and other issues. It’s no different if it’s cold outside, or warm outside. One must take some care in that regard.The temperature rating of the EOS R5 Mark II is the same as the Canon EOS R5 and shouldn’t worry any potential customers.I spent last January in -30c weather chasing Pallas’s Cats in Mongolia over 6 days, and there were plenty of EOS R5 cameras on that trip that didn’t miss a beat.The Always Grumpy Pallas’s Cat – Mongolia 2024The Canon EOS R3 is also rated to 0C.The same can’t be said for the A1’s used by a couple of people, as they all failed numerous times in the extreme cold. I will note, the Nikon DSLRs that some friends had didn’t miss a beat..My process with gear in extreme cold (from a Canadian)Put your gear in your bag and close it up.Remove the batteries from the cameraPlace your bag outside of your accomodation for 60-90 minutes before your shoot.Always have silica packs in your bag, as your accomodation can get humid from drying clothing and using a shower for example.Do the same process when coming back into your accomodation. Don’t open your bag for 60-90 minutes.A -30C environment is extreme for a lot of us, so I wouldn’t worry too much about shooting in cold weather with the EOS R5 Mark II. Just make sure that you have a dozen batteries. :)The new Canon R5 Mark II is an impressive all rounder. The price point may be a tad high, but Canon users wanting to upgrade will not be disappointed if they take the plunge.Performance is excellent, features covering the whole gamut of photography and videography.Ergonomics are a personal thing, but some features are universally useful and the outstanding EVF is one of them.The EVF has come of age and rivals the best optical pentaprism viewfinders. The offset here is the price, so although the performance is there it does not come cheap.
