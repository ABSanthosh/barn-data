You can check out our first look reviews of the Canon RF 16-28mm F2.8 IS STM and see how it matches up.Canon EOS R6 Mark II with the Canon RF 28-70mm F2.8 IS STMI suspect we’ll see another lens that continues from 70mm to form the trinity of lenses for this series. But for now, we have the Canon RF 16-28mm f/2.8 IS STM and the Canon 28-70mm f/2.8 IS STM.When reading any review, you must take the data and think how the data mimics your shooting style and objectives for the lens. For me, the fact that it’s stellar at 28mm makes this an instant win. I shoot far more at the wide and 50mm focal ranges than 50 to 70mm.Canon RF 28-70mm F2.8 IS STMBut you may be the type of person to shoot more between 50 and 70mm, and if your sample of this lens is similar to to the reviewers, then there are some question marks over its performance.The Canon RF 28-70mm f/2.8 IS STM has the weirdest resolution characteristic that we’ve seen from a zoom lens in a long while. In the low to mid-range, the lens can rival prime lenses with an outstanding broader center quality and a very good outer image field.At 70mm, the broader center is still superb, but the border/corner quality falls apart. The border quality is still good at f/2.8 but the corners are downright poor. For decent corners, you have to stop down to f/11 (!) here, but it’s at least not impossible. https://opticallimits.com/canon/canon-rf/canon-rf-28-70mm-f-2-8-is-stm-review/To be honest, this sounds like a design decision. Everything else with the lens (sans no lens hood) Klaus didn’t find anything too out of the ordinary and OpticalLimits breaks down the pros and cons as follows for the Canon RF 28-70 f/2.8 IS STM.PROSExcellent quality in the low to mid-rangeQuick AFLightweight and compactCONSWhat happened at 70mm, Canon?Retractable lens designRelies heavily on auto-correctionOverpricedNo lens hood at this price point isOptical Limits gives the lens an overall score of 6/10 – but keep in mind what we stated that this may be a bad lens.Optical Quality – 6/10Build Quality – 7/10Price / Performance – 5/10According to OpticalLimitsThe Canon RF 28-70mm f/2.8 STM IS is a somewhat strange combination of qualities that you can find in professional and budget lenses. This doesn’t mean that this concept doesn’t work. If you can live with a few compromises, the lens can deliver great results.Optically, it is nothing short of impressive in the low- to mid-zoom range. The center quality is still great towards the long end, but the corners are weak here. If you use 70mm for portraits, this won’t matter, but it’s not ideal for landscape or architecture photography.The lens relies heavily on autocorrection. In RAW images, the distortion and vignetting is high, but then again – image autocorrection is a fact of life now anyway.There are always compromises on lenses. This is certainly a lens about which you have to decide if the compromises are worth it.Is the Review Accurate?I rarely question reviews, and this isn’t about me being a Canon fanboy.Klaus may also have had a bad sample of the lens that exhibited a large resolution falloff at 70mm in the corners. I’m wondering if this is a bad sample because we didn’t notice the resolution dropping off this significantly, as we discussed in our preview of the Canon RF 28-70mm F2.8 IS STM.Canon’s MTF plot for the Canon RF 28-70 F2.8 IS STMAs we can see, the blue lines indicate resolution, and if anything, 70mm should have been better than 28mm.I’ll be curious to see other reviews that break down the resolution scientifically, but that doesn’t seem to be the case for the Canon RF 28-70mm F2.8 IS STM.Usually, the MTF is similar to real life results and in this case, it’s not. This could also indicate a problematic QA lens, so make sure you check the lens at 70mm quickly if you buy one.Source: Optical LimitsWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
