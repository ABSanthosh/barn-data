That technique is to restrict yourself. That can be done in different ways. Using a single prime lens is one that I talked about recently. Restricting the number of shots you take is another, as is revisiting the same location multiple times. Today, I would like to talk about another restrictive technique that I think really boosts your creativity. Limiting yourself to just one hour. I tried it out recently for a YouTube video I was creating and found it a very compelling way to get more creative, and the images I have used in this article were taken in that one period. Let me explain a little more. Why Restrict Yourself? Restricting yourself in photography, in general, might seem a counterintuitive way of doing things. After all, digital gave us the freedom to shoot as much as we liked for as long as we wanted (given enough batteries). That, however, is the problem. That freedom to continue shooting everything can often come at the cost of creativity. We speed up, we shoot everything and anything, our photography becomes less considered, less patient, and in my opinion, less creative. I have a disdain for photographers who boast on social media about how many shots they got on a particular shoot. I would rather have 5 good shots than 500 average shots. Adding any of the restrictions I mentioned above, you will tighten up your compositions, take more time, and get better shots. So why one hour? This image is from about 20 minutes in. By Jason Row Photography Restricting Yourself To One Hour When we go out with no fixed time frame in which to capture images, we can get lazy. We can overthink a single image, or conversely, we can try to capture far too much without thinking creatively. We can get a good shot, but ignore the fact that the light is going to improve in 5 minutes, missing out on a great shot. In short, we lose focus on what’s important. Many of us live busy lives, and often that can mean that when we do get the chance to take some photos, we tend to try and shoot as much as we can. As I mentioned, restricting yourself in general can be a very good thing in photography. Restricting yourself to one hour has some very specific and perhaps surprising results. The first thing that you will notice is that you start to think and compose quicker. You start to notice things faster and, in turn, see more of the details in a shot. You may well start to see the light differently, how it can change minute by minute at a given location. Time limiting can actually boost creativity. By Jason Row Photography Another thing that you may well notice is that you don’t actually feel rushed. You are not trying to cram in as many shots as you can, rush around from location to location. That lack of haste is actually a creativity boost. You will find yourself slowing down despite the time restriction. So, how would you go about a one-hour photo shoot? One Hour To Better Photography The first thing is to manage your expectations. Not just about what you will capture but the location and the weather as well. The concept works best without too much preplanning. Pick a location that you think will be suitable. It could be a district of a city or town, a beach, or perhaps a mountain landscape. Choose a time to go and shoot, and don’t worry too much about the weather. In terms of equipment, don’t weigh yourself down with loads of kit. Like having too much time, having too much gear leads to indecision on what lens to use, whether to set up a tripod, etc. I like to restrict myself to one camera, one lens, which can be a prime or zoom. My preference is for zooms when shooting in just one hour. Get to the location and take a few minutes just to relax and look around. Then set a timer on your phone for exactly one hour and just wander. Try not to look at the timer; doing so can introduce haste. Instead, take your time to observe, compose and shoot. The key to a one-hour photo shoot is not the quantity, but the quality. Remember to look back on your stroll. By Jason Row Photography If a particular shot or location is working, don’t feel the need to rush it and move on; instead, simply enjoy what you are doing. I would also advise not to chimp your photos, trust your instinct and enjoy the fruits of your labour when you get home. Often, chimping can lead us to continually retake the same shot, as well as delete shots that might not have worked. Those poor shots are worth keeping as they show us where we went wrong. When the timer alarm goes off, stop shooting, regardless of what you are taking at that moment. Put the camera away, perhaps get a coffee, relax and think back over the shots that you have taken. There is always something to shoot. By Jason Row Photography What Will You Learn In One Hour? In a single one-hour shoot, you will learn not to rush and to take time with individual compositions rather than shooting everything you see. However, if you use the one-hour technique on a regular and frequent basis, you will learn much more. The first and perhaps most important thing is that you will become much more instinctive with your camera controls. The simple act of raising the camera, choosing the settings, and shooting will become second nature. The last shot of the hour. By Jason Rowe Photography You will find yourself scanning a scene much more carefully, yet picking out good compositions much quicker. You will also find yourself working on a single composition instead of hunting for many. Perhaps most importantly, you will find yourself gaining confidence. Confidence not only in your ability with the camera, but also with the work you are capturing. Restricting your photography to just one hour might seem counterintuitive; however, if you try it out regularly, you will soon find your creativity improving and your ability with the camera getting more instinctive. That can only be a good thing considering the limited time you need to put into it.",

Often, chimping can lead us to continually retake the same shot, as well as delete shots that might not have worked. Those poor shots are worth keeping as they show us where we went wrong. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n  When the timer alarm goes off, stop shooting, regardless of what you are taking at that moment. Put the camera away, perhaps get a coffee, relax and think back over the shots that you have taken. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://www.lightstalking.com/wp-content/uploads/reflection-of-a-statue-in-the-pub-window-in-durham.jpeg.webp 2048w, https://www.lightstalking.com/wp-content/uploads/reflection-of-a-statue-in-the-pub-window-in-durham-400x267.jpeg.webp 400w, https://www.lightstalking.com/wp-content/uploads/reflection-of-a-statue-in-the-pub-window-in-durham-1024x683.jpeg.webp 1024w, https://www.lightstalking.com/wp-content/uploads/reflection-of-a-statue-in-the-pub-window-in-durham-768x512.jpeg.webp 768w, https://www.lightstalking.com/wp-content/uploads/reflection-of-a-statue-in-the-pub-window-in-durham-1536x1024.jpeg.webp 1536w, https://www.lightstalking.com/wp-content/uploads/reflection-of-a-statue-in-the-pub-window-in-durham-1200x800.jpeg.webp 1200w, https://www.lightstalking.com/wp-content/uploads/reflection-of-a-statue-in-the-pub-window-in-durham-1980x1320.jpeg.webp 1980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" type=\"image/webp\"/\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://www.lightstalking.com/wp-content/uploads/reflection-of-a-statue-in-the-pub-window-in-durham.jpeg\" alt=\"Reflection of a statue in the pub window in Durham, England\" srcset=\"https://www.lightstalking.com/wp-content/uploads/reflection-of-a-statue-in-the-pub-window-in-durham.jpeg 2048w, https://www.lightstalking.com/wp-content/uploads/reflection-of-a-statue-in-the-pub-window-in-durham-400x267.jpeg 400w, https://www.lightstalking.com/wp-content/uploads/reflection-of-a-statue-in-the-pub-window-in-durham-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://www.lightstalking.com/wp-content/uploads/reflection-of-a-statue-in-the-pub-window-in-durham-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.lightstalking.com/wp-content/uploads/reflection-of-a-statue-in-the-pub-window-in-durham-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://www.lightstalking.com/wp-content/uploads/reflection-of-a-statue-in-the-pub-window-in-durham-1200x800.jpeg 1200w, https://www.lightstalking.com/wp-content/uploads/reflection-of-a-statue-in-the-pub-window-in-durham-1980x1320.jpeg 1980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThere is always something to shoot.
