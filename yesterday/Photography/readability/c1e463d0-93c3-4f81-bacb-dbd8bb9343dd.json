That headline above – that’s a question I got asked this week, and here’s what I do: A. The only two things I do are to make sure when I export the files as JPEGs (using Lightroom Classic’s Export window seen below) are: (1) converted to sRGB mode for the Web, and (2) I add sharpening for online in that same Export window. I don’t resize the image – I upload the full-resolution image as is. Above: (1) Here’s where you choose sRGB as your color profile for viewing in a Web Browser. Above: (2) In the Output Sharpening section of the Export dialog, I turn on the Output Sharpening checkbox and choose “Screen” as the destination, and set my Amount to ‘High’ (unless I’ve previously sharpened this image using a plug-in, like Topaz Sharpen AI or On1 Tack Sharp. I have a full course on Adobe Portfolio If you want to learn how to use Adobe Portfolio (to get your portfolio up and running tonight), then you can watch my easy step-by-step course called “Getting your portfolio online tonight using Adobe Tools” which is kind of a lame name, but the course itself is really helpful (at least that’s what photographers who have watched the course have said). You don’t have to be a KelbyOne member to watch the course – you can buy the course and own it for just $29. Here’s the link. Have a great Monday everybody. 🙂 -Scott The post Q.
