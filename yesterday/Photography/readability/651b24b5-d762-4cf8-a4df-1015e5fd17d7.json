  "text": "TLDR; Canon is Doomed.Okay, since you are still reading, let’s discuss. Canon is in an “odd place” right now with several cameras. We know that one ILC camera (EOS RV) is forthcoming, and the new PowerShot V1 has already been released in Asia. This, combined with the fact that Canon’s latest releases in the later part of 2024 were high-priced, low-volume items (the EOS R1 and R5 Mark II), means that Canon is in a bit of a down cycle right now.So, no, Canon is not doomed.That said, the “product mix” that Canon and other manufacturers have been mentioning each quarter for the last 5+ years is making it so that they aren’t selling volume but trying to extract as much profit as possible from each camera they sell. This always makes me feel a bit uncomfortable, but I’m not paid to worry about those corporate-level decisions.Hopefully, this year will be the year of selling as many units as possible with the upcoming EOS RV, EOS RE-1, and possibly an EOS R7 replacement.MAP Camera’s Top 10 List for February 2025I’m not really writing this to discuss Canon, but about the crazy eclectic top 10 list February turned out to be.

Cameras with integrated lenses take 5 out of the top 10, with three full-frame cameras and only two APS-C cameras.Fujifilm X100VITo be honest, the Fujifilm X100VI’s taking the #1 spot isn’t much of a surprise; it’s an incredibly popular camera in Asia. It’s out of stock everywhere. Fujifilm can’t make enough of them.Fujifilm X100VIPanasonic LUMIX DC-TZ99The Panasonic LUMIX DC-TZ99 caught me by surprise because it was a half-hearted update that added a type-C USB jack and removed the viewfinder. Oddly, it seems to be selling well, with this being the first month of camera availability. I guess the Canon cripple hammer was officially licensed over to Panasonic for this latest release.Panasonic LUMIX TZ99Why are we talking about this anyway?The top 10 list is usually pretty boring with the usual suspects in the top 10 (Sony, Canon, Nikon and Fuji), but this year clearly shows that something weird and wonderful is still happening in Japan.As we previously mentioned, the camera companies care deeply about the domestic market.Photography trends typically flow out of Japan and around Asia first and then to the rest of the world. So, watching what happens in Japan can help tell us something about what the future may hold for the rest of the industry.We were the first to discuss compact cameras and the lack of new cameras from Sony, Canon, and others, especially with the trends from Japan. Now, around a year later, here we are with a new PowerShot V1 to talk about.
