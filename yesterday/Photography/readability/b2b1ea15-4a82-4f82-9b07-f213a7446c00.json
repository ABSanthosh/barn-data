We have already seen announcements from OM Systems and Nikon, with the latter having another round. Sony is expected to announce some new lenses and Panasonic won’t be left out.Canon is going to be no exception and we expect at least one camera to be announced ahead of the show, and maybe as early as next week and it’ll be the PowerShot V1. Unless something drastically changes, the camera is already in the hands of the usual suspects.Also possible is the rumoured firmware announcement for both the EOS R1 and EOS R5 Mark II, which are said to be significant. It’s always difficult to nail down firmware dates, but we think we’ll get an announcement ahead of the actual release.It’s probably time Canon lets us know what the little window on the back of the EOS R1 is for.Lenses? We had the RF 16-28mm f/2.8 IS STM announced late last month but we have had no word on any others coming before CP+. There is a possibility of being surprised again or even some kind of development announcement. Those don’t happen all that often for lenses and they’re extremely hard to get advanced information about.The EOR R50 V has really only been mentioned by name, so we don’t think it’ll be coming in the near term. Hopefully, we get some clarification on that this week.We do expect some new gear from Canon in March, and there have been a bunch of times in the past that Canon waits until after a large consumer-focused trade show.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.",
