Black Lenovo laptop computer turned on displaying man in red shirt in Photoshop. Photo by Onur Binay Whether this is a good thing is still up for debate but the future moves forward nonetheless with today’s headline coming from none other than Adobe who used to worry that such advancements would make their very customers obsolete. Today somewhat furthers that narrative with agentic AI or, essentially, an AI-based chat assistant to help you with your workflow in Adobe products. Think of it as a kind of ChatGPT but for Adobe and focused on creative endeavors. In all, it sounds like a host of great features to add but one in particular caught our eye and that’s how Photoshop will benefit: “Our vision is for Photoshop to be able to analyze your image and recommend smart, context-aware edits. Want a more dramatic sky? Photoshop could not only spot the opportunity to improve your image but also take the action for you with a single click, while keeping you in control. We also envision you being able to use natural language to access more than 1,000 one-click actions in Photoshop.” At this stage of the game, a lot of the heavy lifting will still be done by human hands but this might help ease others into using Adobe products. After all, some people find them somewhat intimidating and while simple usage is not hard to grasp, more advanced and nuanced applications of Adobe’s software often takes time and practice. Agentic AI might help shorten that learning process. Any thoughts on AI-powered chatbot assistants in Adobe products are welcome in the comments. We have some more news for you at this link.
