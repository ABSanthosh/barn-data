Blue red and green letters illustration of social media icons. Photo by Alexander Shatov Well, you’d be wrong because apparently there are enough people not on the platform to warrant paying creators to bring new to Meta’scrown jewel. That’s not a new business tactic, but it’s sort of novel for social media which is probably why it is just in a beta testing phase at the moment, FStoppers reports. When you consider some of the recent legislative action in the States, there is some incentive to push forward such a program. Creators basically have users sign up via a link and are then paid per sign up or after 1000 “qualified taps.” Successful promoters can earn up to $USD 20,000, the website reports. Naturally, it’s going to be hard to reach that level but there are certainly some accounts that could blow past that requirement with ease given their scale and reach. This new strategy would seem to be in direct competition with TikTok’s and YouTube who have similar programs, highlighting the intense competition in the social media space. You might recall some time back there was talk of banning TikTok in the United States. While that hasn’t gone anywhere, it did spur a kind of blood-in-the-water approach by rivals to scoop up users left behind if TikTok were banned. And while that didn’t happen, the race to secure as many users as possible continues, even while it becomes increasingly harder for creators to make money no matter what the platform. Any thoughts on this strategy are welcome in the comments. Check out some of our other photography news at this link.
