We also offer a handful of quick tips – so that if you want to capture some beautiful images of your own, you know exactly what to do. Ready to be blown away? Let’s dive right in. What is forced perspective photography? Forced perspective is a technique that manipulates human perception to make objects appear larger, smaller, farther, or closer than they actually are. Generally speaking, a forced perspective photo contains a near (foreground) subject and a distant (background) subject. Through careful positioning, the photographer makes the two subjects appear on the same plane – when they are, in fact, several (or hundreds) of feet apart. Even if you’ve never heard the term “forced perspective” before, you’ve probably seen classic examples of this type of image: tourists pretending to prop up the Leaning Tower of Pisa, people “holding” one another in the palm of their hands, or a person “crushing” a building with their foot. Amazing forced perspective examples Check out these 16 outstanding examples of forced perspective photography! Be warned, however: They’re incredibly mind-bending.

You just need to know a few tricks: 1. Choose a small foreground subject and a big background subject The best forced perspective images tend to feature a clear foreground and background subject. So I recommend you select these in advance. The background subject should be many times larger than the foreground subject. Look at the examples above; see how the foreground element appears slightly larger than (or equal in size to) the background element. That only happens when the foreground is small and the background is big! The most basic method is to position a person (or a person’s hand) in the foreground and a (reasonably) tall building in the background. This is a perfectly valid approach, and when you’re just starting out, it’s a great way to have plenty of forced perspective fun. Over time, you’ll start to notice more and more photo opportunities, and you can create more complex images that include unique foreground and background subjects. 2. Use a narrow aperture to keep the entire scene in focus To create the most effective forced perspective illusion, you must trick the viewer into believing that your foreground and background subjects exist on the same plane. Which means that your foreground and background subjects should both appear sharp. After all, two objects on the same plane should feature identical levels of sharpness! If you simply point your camera and shoot, you’ll often end up with a sharp foreground subject and a blurry background subject (or vice versa). Instead, you should switch your camera over to its Manual or Aperture Priority mode, then dial in a narrow aperture (such as f/8, f/11, or beyond). I’d also encourage you to switch your lens over to manual focus, then adjust the focus ring until you’ve focused about a third of the way into the scene. The narrow aperture will ensure that your shot has a deep depth of field, and by carefully focusing your lens, you can keep the entire scene in focus (from foreground to background). 3. Carefully position the foreground subject To maintain a forced perspective illusion, you must make sure that your foreground subject’s position sells the shot. Don’t just position the subject sloppily. Instead, pay careful attention to the effect you’re trying to create – and make sure the foreground subject lines up perfectly with the background. If your subject is “touching” a building with an outstretched finger, the finger should be positioned right on the edge of the object. If your foreground subject is “holding” another person in their palm, the background subject’s shoes should be aligned with the top of the foreground subject’s hand. Pro tip: If you’re struggling to position your subject, try leaving it and moving your camera instead. And if you can’t sell the effect without perfect positioning, I encourage you to use a tripod; it’ll keep your camera in place while you adjust your settings as needed. Forced perspective photography examples: final words Now that you’ve finished this article, you know to create beautiful forced perspective shots of your very own – and you’ve seen plenty of amazing examples! So head out with your camera and practice. Pay careful attention to positioning, control your settings, and select the perfect foreground and background subjects. Good luck!

id=\"quick-tips-for-amazing-forced-perspective-photos\"\u003e3 quick tips for amazing forced perspective photos\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCapturing jaw-dropping forced perspective shots isn’t hard. You just need to know a few tricks:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 data-section=\"\" id=\"choose-a-small-foreground-subject-and-a-big-background-subject\"\u003e1. Choose a small foreground subject and a big background subject\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best forced perspective images tend to feature a clear foreground and background subject. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I recommend you select these in advance. The background subject should be many times larger than the foreground subject. Look at the examples above; see how the foreground element appears slightly larger than (or equal in size to) the background element. That only happens when the foreground is small and the background is big!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most basic method is to position a person (or a person’s hand) in the foreground and a (reasonably) tall building in the background. This is a perfectly valid approach, and when you’re just starting out, it’s a great way to have plenty of forced perspective fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver time, you’ll start to notice more and more photo opportunities, and you can create more complex images that include unique foreground and background subjects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 data-section=\"\" id=\"use-a-narrow-aperture-to-keep-the-entire-scene-in-focus\"\u003e2. Use a narrow aperture to keep the entire scene in focus\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo create the most effective forced perspective illusion, you must \u003cem\u003etrick \u003c/em\u003ethe viewer into believing that your foreground and background subjects exist on the same plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich means that your foreground and background subjects should both appear sharp. After all, two objects on the same plane should feature identical levels of sharpness!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you simply point your camera and shoot, you’ll often end up with a sharp foreground subject and a blurry background subject (or vice versa). Instead, you should switch your camera over to its \u003ca href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Manual (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eManual\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-versus-shutter-priority-which-shooting-mode/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Aperture Priority mode (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eAperture Priority mode\u003c/a\u003e, then dial in a \u003ca href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"narrow aperture (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003enarrow \u003c/em\u003eaperture\u003c/a\u003e (such as f/8, f/11, or beyond).

Carefully position the foreground subject\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo maintain a forced perspective illusion, you must make sure that your foreground subject’s position \u003cem\u003esells\u003c/em\u003e the shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t just position the subject sloppily. Instead, pay careful attention to the effect you’re trying to create – and make sure the foreground subject lines up \u003cem\u003eperfectly \u003c/em\u003ewith the background. If your subject is “touching” a building with an outstretched finger, the finger should be positioned right on the edge of the object. If your foreground subject is “holding” another person in their palm, the background subject’s shoes should be aligned with the top of the foreground subject’s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePro tip: If you’re struggling to position your subject, try leaving it and moving your camera instead. And if you can’t sell the effect without perfect positioning, I encourage you to use a \u003ca aria-label=\"tripod (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/best-tripods-for-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003etripod\u003c/a\u003e; it’ll keep your camera in place while you adjust your settings as needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-section=\"\" id=\"forced-perspective-photography-examples-final-words\"\u003eForced perspective photography examples: final words\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that you’ve finished this article, you know to create beautiful forced perspective shots of your very own – and you’ve seen plenty of amazing examples!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo head out with your camera and practice.
