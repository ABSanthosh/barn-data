  "description": "Sure enough, no sooner had I posted a link to my post from Friday on my Facebook page than someone had to comment that they wouldn’t subscribe to any of Adobe’s plans. Ugh. I didn’t take it up with him there, but for all those still holding out (and “stickin’ it to the man”), there have been hundreds of enhancements added over the years that make both Lightroom and Photohsop work better, much faster, much easier, with much better workflows all around, but beyond all that – here are some of the big features you’ve missed in Lr and Ps by holding out : LIGHTROOM: Of course, none of this includes all the Camera support updates, or Len Profile updates or like I mentioned, all the myriad of tweaks and enhancements that make Lightroom so, so much better than it was before. Important to note: As I mentioned on “The Grid,” if we consider only the standard rate of inflation, which Adobe has already taken into account with the perpetual model, today’s perpetual price would be approximately $1,355.00. All at once. Up front. This does not include upgrades. They would be $225 every year to 18 months based on those same inflation rates. Of course, you don’t have to upgrade; you could continue to use outdated software with fewer features and no camera or lens updates, but most users didn’t skip those updates for those very reasons. To the holdouts: you can use faster, better software with more features, or you can keep “sticking it to the man.” Your call. Have a kick butt Monday, everybody! -Scott P.S.
