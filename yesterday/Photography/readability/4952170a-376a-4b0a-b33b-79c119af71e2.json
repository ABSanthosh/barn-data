The company is planning to launch the 18-300mm F/3.5-6.3 Di III-A VC VXD lens in the summer of 2025. Image via Tamron Tamron is developing the 18-300 mm lens for the Nikon and Canon interchangeable lens, APS-C mirrorless cameras. The zoom range is quite versatile, as it covers a huge range from 18mm for landscapes and other wide angle shots to 300mm that can be used to capture wildlife and sports. The entire zoom range can be used to capture various subjects and genre of photography, including portraits. The lens is expected to be of compact design and that makes it even more impressive as it can be carried along easily when travelling or when on hikes. The lens is fast, has image stabilization and hence will help in capturing crisp details of the subjects. Here are some of the most important features of this lens: Zoom range from wide to telephoto – 18-300mm F/3.5-6.3 Di III-A VC VXD (Model B061) for APS-C mirrorless format cameras 19 lens elements in 15 groups Fast and precise autofocus Maximum magnification ratio – 1:2 (wide) and 1:4 (tele) Amazing optical performance in the entire zoom range Tamron's Vibration Compensation Filter size – 67mm Weight approximately 620g 7 aperture blades More details about this lens can be found here.
