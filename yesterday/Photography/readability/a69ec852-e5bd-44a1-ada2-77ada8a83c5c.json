  "text": "The U.S. Department of State has announced that nonimmigrant visa applicants must now disclose and set all social media accounts to public as part of an enhanced vetting process. In a significant policy shift, the U.S. Department of State has updated its requirements for F, M, and J nonimmigrant visas, stating that applicants must now set their social media accounts to public visibility, effective immediately. The directive is stated to be aimed at strengthening identity verification and national security screening processes for international students and exchange visitors seeking entry into the United States. “The State Department is committed to protecting our nation and our citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process. A U.S. visa is a privilege, not a right,” details the press release announcement by the Office of the Spokesperson. “We use all available information in our visa screening and vetting to identify visa applicants who are inadmissible to the United States, including those who pose a threat to U.S. national security. Under new guidance, we will conduct a comprehensive and thorough vetting, including online presence, of all student and exchange visitor applicants in the F, M, and J nonimmigrant classifications. To facilitate this vetting, all applicants for F, M, and J nonimmigrant visas will be instructed to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media profiles to public.” Public Social Media Access Now Required for Vetting The change affects individuals applying under three major visa categories: F visas for academic students, M visas for vocational students, and J visas for exchange visitors. Under the new guidance, applicants will be expected to make all existing social media profiles publicly accessible to U.S. consular officials as part of the vetting process. The State Department has emphasized that this step is designed to facilitate a “comprehensive and thorough” evaluation of each applicant’s admissibility to the United States. In response, U.S. embassies around the world have begun posting the news to social media to help update and inform potential applicants. National Security Framing Guides Policy Shift This development underscores the Department’s position that a visa is a privilege rather than a right. According to the announcement, U.S. visa screening already incorporates a wide range of tools and sources, and the addition of publicly visible social media content is intended to further assist in identifying individuals who may present a risk to public safety or national interests. The policy is part of a broader strategy to increase scrutiny of visa applicants amid heightened global concerns about border security and digital threats. Officials stress that each visa adjudication is a national security decision and that the U.S. must remain vigilant in determining the intent and eligibility of those seeking entry. Implementation Timeline and Next Steps for Applicants Consular posts around the world will begin scheduling F, M, and J visa appointments again in the near future. Prospective applicants are advised to monitor embassy and consulate websites for the most up-to-date appointment availability. The new requirement has already drawn attention from education stakeholders and international communities, many of whom are expected to seek further clarity on how the policy will be implemented and whether it will impact application outcomes. “Every visa adjudication is a national security decision. The United States must be vigilant during the visa issuance process to ensure that those applying for admission into the United States do not intend to harm Americans and our national interests, and that all applicants credibly establish their eligibility for the visa sought, including that they intend to engage in activities consistent with the terms for their admission,” the press release states. As the U.S. government moves to incorporate digital transparency into its visa decision-making process, the long-term implications for privacy, access to education, and international exchange remain to be fully understood.
