With the RX1R series being a popular one among select photographers, Sony decided to release a new model. Sony has used a back-illuminated CMOS image sensor combined with the BIONZ XR image processing engine, that produces high quality images and low noise. The sensor comes with anti-reflective coating which helps to eliminate the optical low-pass filter, resulting in better image quality. Image via Sony As with most of Sony's professional cameras in the Alpha series, the RX1R III comes with an AI processing unit that can recognise movements of most subjects, making tracking subjects easy even when their face is not visible. Even though the camera comes with a fixed 35mm lens, the Step Crop shooting function will allow the user to switch between three equivalent focal lengths – 35 mm, 50 mm and 70 mm through assigned buttons/dials. The camera lens also comes with a macro ring, that enables switching to macro mode instantly. Following Sony's “Road to Zero” initiative, the RX1R III and other of Sony's imaging products are manufactured at facilities that operate on 100% renewable energy. The packaging also comes in environmental friendly material. Here are some of the most important features of the Sony RX1R III: Sensor – 61MP full-frame Exmor R CMOS sensor ZEISS Sonnar T 35mm F2 lens – fixed BIONZ XR processor  Macro ring for instant macro mode switching – 20 cm minimum focus distance Anti-reflection coating on sensor Step Crop Shooting – 35mm, 50mm, 70mm equivalent 693 phase-detection AF points High iso sensitivity Advanced AI for subject recognition and AF tracking 12 creative presets and 3 film style looks Touch LCD screen Compact and lightweight Battery life: 300 still images USB Type-C port If you wish to watch the product video, check the YouTube video below: And, the concept video can be watched below: The RX1R III also has optional accessories that can be purchased separately: TG-2 – thumb grip that can be attached to the multi-interface shoe, to provide stability when handholding the camera LCS-RXL – protective case for the camera with access to all ports LHP-1 – lens hood that can be attached to the bayonet mount, is lightweight and can protect the lens from impact The Sony RX1R III is available to pre-order and will be available by the end of July 2025.
