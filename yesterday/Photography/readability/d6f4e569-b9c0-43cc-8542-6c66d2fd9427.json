  "description": "With a series for f/1.2 lenses in the Nikkor Z range like the Nikkor Z 50mm f/1.2 S a standard prime lens and Nikkor Z 85mm f/1.2 S, a short telephoto lens, Nikon has now announced another of its fast lens, the Nikkor Z 35mm f/1.2 S lens.

This lens is not a wide or a moderate focal length lens, but is one that will be slightly wider than the 50mm f/1.2 lens. Image by Nikon This slightly wide angle prime lens can capture scenes in great detail with excellent clarity and contrast. Nikon has designed this lens aimed at both filmmakers and professional photographers because of its convenient 35mm focal length. This lens will be a great choice for photographers who wish to capture intimate portraits with dreamy blurry backgrounds or environmental, street portraits where the environment needs to be included in the frame. The f/1.2 aperture will help to capture stories in a true but magical way. Here are some of the technical features of the lens: Full frame lens with precise autofocus and internal focusing Advanced anti-reflective coatings (Meso Amorphous Coat, Nano Crystal Coat, and ARNEO Coat) to minimise distortions, flare and ghosting Minimum aperture f/1.2 and maximum aperture f/16. Weighs approximately 1.06 kg 17 lens elements arranged in 15 groups Aperture with 11 diaphragm blades Filter size 82mm Weather sealed for dust and drip resistance The f/1.2 aperture will provide a superfast performance and has huge light gathering capability. The lens coatings are made to handle even the harshest of lighting situations where portraits can be captured without much issues like flares and artefacts even when shooting into the light. The lens is expected to cost around $2799.95 and more details about the lens can be found here. You can read more photography news at the link here.",
