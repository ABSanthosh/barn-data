  "description": "Announcing ON1 Pro and Lightpanel! We’re excited to announce the launch of ON1 Pro, a new brand from ON1 designed to meet the unique workflow challenges faced by professional photographers. While ON1 is expanding with this new line, they’re not going anywhere—their nearly 20 years of developing photo editing software will continue to power everything they do, including growing the ON1 product line and ON1 Photo RAW. The first product under the new ON1 Pro brand, Lightpanel, is an AI assistant that works seamlessly inside Adobe Lightroom Classic. This new application, designed for high-volume portrait and wedding photographers, will deliver AI-driven culling, AI-driven editing, and soon, job tracking—right inside the Lightroom Classic workflow. All of it is designed to cut the culling and editing time in half. As award-winning Photoshop, photography \u0026 Lightroom author Scott Kelby puts it: “Instead of requiring photographers to learn a new product, Lightpanel supercharges the workflows we already have, cutting workloads in half.” Learn more about ON1 Pro and Lightpanel in their overview video.
