We are seeing growth in 35 and 120 film, there is the obvious boom of instant cameras, the return of the fixed lens compact, such as the Canon PowerShot V1 and it looks like the next thing will be “retro” styled cameras.We’re pretty confident at this point that we will see a retro camera based on the Canon AE-1 some time in Q4 or early Q1 2026 for the 50th anniversary of the AE-1. We are going to call the new camera the Canon EOS RE-1, because it just makes sense.Nikon ZfNikon has obviously done well in this segment, or they wouldn’t keep releasing new models such as the mirrorless Nikon Zf.We have been told that the camera will not be in the upper segment in teh Canon lineup such as the EOS R5 Mark II or the EOS R6 Mark III whenever that comes to market.Canon EOS RE-1 FeaturesThe Canon EOS RE-1 will be based on Canon’s current non-stacked 24mp sensor that we see in both the Canon EOS R6 Mark II and Canon EOS R8.If that isn’t what you wanted to hear, it makes a lot of sense if you think about it. The camera will be geared torwards photographers and to tug on the hearstrings of nostalgia. It will have to be a camera that sits at a similar pricepoint as the Nikon Zf, and that’s around $2000.This won’t really be a camera videographers will be into, so the market is probably a lot smaller than something like an Canon EOS R6 Mark III.Canon AE-1We have also been told that it will be equipped with IBIS, so it’s not just a Canon EOS R8 redo at a higher price. $2000 is the likely sweet spot.It would probably also do quite well as a second body for some full-frame shooters.We Can’t Wait To Be HonestWe don’t know if it will come in both black and silver at this time, but as long as there is a silver one with a matching lens or two, we think it would be pretty cool.The Canon RE-1 will probably be a slow burn for information, but as mentioned earlier, we’re pretty confident that it is indeed coming.Love or hate the idea, let’s just let the ones that love it, love it.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
