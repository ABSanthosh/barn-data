The chorus has become louder over the years, and it will likely get even louder the longer that customers have to wait.Modern third-party lenses don't peak my interest all that much, but there is a large segmenet of photographers that really want to see them come to market, as Canon lenses aren't getting any cheaper.That said, Canon has had no problem selling their “overpriced” lenses since the launch of the EOS R syste.SIGMA RF 10-18MM F/2.8 DC DNAPS-C Format | f/2.8 to f/2216-29mm (Full-Frame Equivalent)Ultra Wide-Angle ZoomFast Internal Focus SystemRounded 7-Blade DiaphragmDust \u0026 Splash-Resistant DesignIt wasn't until this year that we saw the first three manufacturers bring third-party APS-C lenses to the RF mount. SIGMA has announced 6 lenses, all of which should hit the street before the year is out. Tamron and Samyang have both announced one a piece. We do expect Meike to enter the fold sooner than later.We have been told (along with others) that at least three Chinese lens makers may be the first third-party full-frame RF lenses to come to market in late 2025. The most mentioned brand is Viltrox and the likelihood of bringing their upcoming 35mm f/1.2 LAB lens to the RF mount first. Viltrox has quickly become a recognized brand and has released some really night autofocus lenses for the E and X mounts.Tamron RF 11-20mm f/2.8 Di III-A RXD18-32mm (35mm Equivalent)Fast Ultra-Wide Angle ZoomRapid eXtra Silent Stepping Drive Motor1x XLD, 2x GM Asph., and 2x LD ElementsBBAR-G2 Lens CoatingWeather-Sealed ConstructionRounded 7-Blade DiaphragmWho the other brands are is anyone's guess at this time, but we've seen both Samyang and Meike bring autofocus full frame lenses to other mounts like the E and X mounts.We have also heard numerous times over the last year or so that Venus Optics is also working on a series of full-frame autofocus lenses, they are known for the Laowa brand.This is good news, even if it's not SIGMA who's going to be the first out of the gate, which doesn't surprise me. I think the Chinese lens makers want to be somewhat more affordable than SIGMA, as SIGMA appears to want to be up-market and still provide great value when compared to the OEM lenses from the likes of Canon, Sony and Nikon.Once we move into 2025, there will likely be a lot more information that will flow if indeed third-party full frame lenses are coming in late 2025. Keep in mind, making lenses is a hard process, and the Chinese makers are playing catch-up for the moment, but we do see the gap closing quickly.There is also another report that hit the web today with the same information, so you can check out what thenewcamera.com has to say.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
