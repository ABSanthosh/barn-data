Over the years, photography has evolved, but one thing remains constant: the passion of photographers to capture moments, tell stories, and push creative boundaries. However, with the rise of AI-generated content (AIGC), it’s become increasingly challenging for genuine photographers to gain recognition. That’s where PULSEpx steps in—with a bold new solution to keep the focus on real talent. Competitions are at the heart of PULSEpx, and we are committed to keeping them fair, meaningful, and focused on real photography. That’s why we’ve introduced PULSEpx AI Moderation—a practical tool designed to ensure authenticity and uphold the integrity of our contests. Here’s how it works: AI-Generated Image Detection As generative AI tools become more common, distinguishing between authentic photography and AI-generated content is increasingly important. Our moderation system identifies and filters out AI-generated images, ensuring that all submissions come from genuine human creativity. This keeps the playing field level and fair for all participants. NSFW Content Filtering To maintain a professional and welcoming space, PULSEpx AI Moderation also screens for inappropriate or offensive content. By automatically filtering out NSFW images, we ensure that our competitions remain respectful and enjoyable for everyone involved. By prioritizing fairness and authenticity, PULSEpx continues to be a platform where real photographers can confidently showcase their talent.
