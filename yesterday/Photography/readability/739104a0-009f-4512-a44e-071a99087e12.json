  "text": "AI images have been circulating the internet, more than ever for about a couple of years now and with AI being integrated into most editing programs, google has also been working on several models and one of the most recent is the Gemini 2.0 Flash experimental model. If you are looking to access the features of Google Gemini, you will need to have a google account and be signed in. Image via Google Google has already been working with many models in the past and their most capable one seems to be the Gemini 2.0. Gemini 2.0 Flash experimental model is built on the success of Gemini 1.5 flash and is available freely to all Gemini users. Gemini 2.0 Flash is faster and comes with new capabilities like natively generated images mixed with text. Gemini 2.0 Flash requires the user to type in prompts that ask Gemini to create an image based on the description provided. You can further change elements or subjects in your images through further prompts. You also have the option to choose a desired aspect ratio for the final image through prompts. In the experimental version, you will get a resulting image that has a watermark on it. Besides the above process of generating images, you can also upload your own image and make changes to it. For example, if you are using a portrait, you can make changes to the outfit, hair, etc., adding hair or try to get different poses/perspectives of the image. For example a side view, a lower perspective of an image and so on. This is applicable for all genre of photos. Besides the above, Gemini 2.0 Flash can also be used to remove unwanted objects or replace objects from a photo, replace backgrounds or even colorise photos. The results achieved using Gemini 2.0 Flash and the capabilities are more similar to the jobs done using photoshop, where some tools in the program were used to perform these actions, whereas in Gemini 2.0 Flash the job is done using prompts. With the Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental already being tried by many users it looks like it could kill programs like Photoshop in the near future, but generating images using prompts, with the help of AI – is this still photography? All these advancements in the field of AI makes us question if we can trust photos anymore, especially when used as evidences. It also makes us check the credibility of the photographer presenting an image. We think AI may change photography in some areas, but it can never replace genuine photography. What are your thoughts on this? Let us know in the comments section below. We would love to hear. We have more news for you to read if you are interested at this link here.",
