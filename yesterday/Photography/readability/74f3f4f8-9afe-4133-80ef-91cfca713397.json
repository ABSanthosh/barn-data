But never fear, because Staten Island Chuck and Jimmy the groundhog had different opinions and said spring would arrive early this year.Lexar Memory CardsYou can never have enough cards, so here are two deals from Lexar that will help you save your photos securely and safely.Lexar 256GB Professional 2000x UHS-II SDXC Memory CardThis deal saves you $105 off the regular price once you add it to the shopping cart. This is a significant savings on a great UHS-II SD card.Key Features256GB CapacityUHS-II / V90 / U3 / Class 10Max Read Speed: 300 MB/sMax Write Speed: 260 MB/sMin Write Speed: 90 MB/sRecords Full HD, 3D, and 4K VideoWater, Shock, Vibration, and X-Ray ProofCan Withstand Extreme TemperaturesBuilt-In Write Protect SwitchBlackmagic Qualified The 256GB Professional 2000x UHS-II SDXC Memory Card from Lexar features a storage capacity of 256GB and takes advantage of the UHS-II bus to support advanced DSLR functions such as continuous shutter bursts and rapid shooting, as well as raw and JPEG captures. This card is also well-suited for video capture, including 4K, 3D, and Full HD video, and can achieve maximum read speeds of up to 300 MB/s and maximum write speeds of up to 260 MB/s. Thanks to its V90 speed class rating, minimum write speeds are guaranteed not to drop below 90 MB/s, making it qualified for use with cameras that include the Blackmagic Pocket 6K G2 and Ursa G2.UHS-II cards achieve their speed through an extra row of pins, and while this card has been designed for cameras that are UHS-II / V90 compatible, it may be used in devices that do not support UHS-II / V90. However, bear in mind that this card will then default to your device’s speed class and bus rating, such as UHS-II and V60, which supports minimum write speeds of 60 MB/s, UHS-II and V30, which supports minimum write speeds of 30 MB/s, or UHS-I and U3, which also supports minimum write speeds of 30 MB/s. If your device does not support U3, this card is compatible with the U1 and Class 10 standards, each of which guarantee minimum write speeds of 10 MB/s.As with most Lexar media, this memory card is able to withstand water, shock, vibration, X-rays, and temperatures from -13 to 185°F, allowing you to take this card with you into extreme environments, such as snow and deserts. Should the card become compromised, users in the Americas will benefit from a limited lifetime warranty, while those in Germany and regions not recognizing the lifetime warranty will benefit from a limited 10-year warranty.Lexar 128GB Professional CFexpress Type B Card GOLD SeriesThis deal saves you $105 off the regular price once you add it to the shopping cart. This is a significant saving for those users who have cameras that use Compact Flash Express Type B cards.Key Features128GB Storage CapacityPCIe 3.0 x2 BusMax Read Speed: 1750 MB/sMax Write Speed: 1500 MB/sMin Sustained Write Speed: 1000 MB/sRecords Raw 8K VideoShock / Vibration / Temperature ProofLimited Lifetime Warranty Get next generation performance with the 128GB Professional CFexpress Type B Card GOLD Series from Lexar, which smoothly captures 8K raw video with ease.

For a limited time, it’s 25% off its regular price. You can never go wrong with a Manfrotto ballhead. This one has a capacity of up to 20lb, so for mirrorless gear, this is suitable for a wide range of applications.Key features;Load Capacity: 19.8 lbHeight: 3.9″Weight: 10.58 ozUp to 90° Portrait Angle TiltIndependent 360° Rotation with LockBall-and-Socket Tension Control200PL-PRO QR Plate, RC2/Arca-CompatibleThis 494 Center Ball Head with 200PL-PRO Quick Release Plate from Manfrotto features an integrated RC2 quick release cam lock and a 200PL-PRO quick release plate. It features a load capacity of 19.8 lb and can be attached to tripods or other support systems that feature a 3/8″-16 mount. By loosening the head’s primary locking knob, the ball-and-socket joint can be quickly swiveled, angled, fully tilted, or returned to its upright position. A recessed dial set within that locking knob can be rotated to apply tension control to the ball-and-socket joint’s movements. Along the opposite side of the ball head, a secondary locking knob controls the ability to rotate the head 360°.Canon RF15-30mm F4.5-6.3 IS STM LensCanon has a lot of wide-angle choices, but this one is their bang for the buck option for now, a limited time.

By loosening the head’s primary locking knob, the ball-and-socket joint can be quickly swiveled, angled, fully tilted, or returned to its upright position. A recessed dial set within that locking knob can be rotated to apply tension control to the ball-and-socket joint’s movements. Along the opposite side of the ball head, a secondary locking knob controls the ability to rotate the head 360°.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr/\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"ub-advanced-heading-77985e25-0586-4f22-a475-402d3b881f9a\" data-blockid=\"77985e25-0586-4f22-a475-402d3b881f9a\"\u003eCanon RF15-30mm F4.5-6.3 IS STM Lens\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI1MDAiIGhlaWdodD0iNDIxIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDQyMSI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgZmlsbD0iI2NmZDRkYiIvPjwvc3ZnPg==\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"421\" data-src=\"https://www.canonrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/61gra2yMUgL.png\" alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://www.canonrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/61gra2yMUgL.png 500w, https://www.canonrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/61gra2yMUgL-150x126.png 150w, https://www.canonrumors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/61gra2yMUgL-450x379.png 450w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eCanon has a lot of wide-angle choices, but this one is their bang for the buck option for now, a limited time.
