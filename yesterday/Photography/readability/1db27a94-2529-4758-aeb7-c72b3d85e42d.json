But if you’re tired of coming home with photos that don’t quite capture the magic of your trip, I’ve got something that’ll help.Tomorrow, June 5, 2025, at 2PM EDT, I’m hosting a free live webinar – “7 Things Pros Know About Travel Photography That Most People Don’t” – where I’ll walk you through the real-world system I use to create my favorite travel images, from start to finish.I made a quick video to tell you exactly what the webinar’s about (it’s just below), but here’s the short version: If you want to stop taking snapshots and start creating the kind of photos you actually want to share and print, this is for you. Whether you’re traveling across the world or just around the corner, you don’t need fancy gear or a huge time investment—you just need a better approach. That’s what I’m going to share with you. I’d love for you to join me (and bring a friend who’s got a trip coming up—they’ll thank you later).Grab your spot here: https://bit.ly/travel-webinar-25Hope to see you there tomorrow!",
