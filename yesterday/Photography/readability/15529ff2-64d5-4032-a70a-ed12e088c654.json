  "text": "Sigma has added a new camera to its compact and lightweight full frame mirrorless series, the Sigma BF. This is a new more compact camera compared to its other pocketable versions the fp and fp L cameras. Image by Sigma The Sigma BF is the first camera to have a unibody design carved out of a single block of aluminium. The shooting mode dial, all the menu and settings are controlled with just three buttons and a dial pad. The new status monitor at the back of the camera displays the current setting and hence the display screen at the back is neat with a clear view of the frame being photographed. The compact design and lesser buttons does not mean that the camera is limited. It comes with advanced technologies, is fast and produces high quality images. This camera is also versatile for filmmakers who wish to capture stories as motion pictures. Here are some important features of the Sigma BF: Interchangeable lens mirrorless camera Approximately 230 GB internal memory L mount Hybrid autofocus system Huge dynamic range and incredible low light performance 24.6 MP sensor Electronic image stabilization for videos Electronic shutter USB-C port for fast charging and data transfer Weight – approximately 446 g including battery The BF camera is available in two colors – silver and black and comes with a completely new user interface and minimal controls. Sigma is also launching 9 lenses along with the Sigma BF in matching colors. More details about this camera can be found here. We have some more news for you to read if you are interested at this link here.",
