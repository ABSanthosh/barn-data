This lens is designed for photographers who are serious about wildlife (especially birds) and sports photography. FE 400-800mm f/6.3-8 G OSS – Image by Sony This lens is the first from the alpha series to reach the 800mm range. The lens produces high quality images throughout its entire zoom range with a neat, creamy and natural looking bokeh and sharp details. Moreover the lens has internal zoom, so while handholding the camera, the lens is perfectly stable when zooming in and out. The autofocus is fast and precise and hence can be a great tool to capture birds and sports subjects that are far and quite fast. The tripod mount allows quick switch between horizontal and vertical orientations. The lens hood comes with a lock button and filter opening to ensure easy operation under any circumstances when out on location. Here are some of the most important technical features of the lens: Fast and precise autofocus to capture very fast moving subjects Teleconverter compatibility with Sony's 1.4x and 2x teleconverters but can cut a lot of light. Tripod mount Optical steadyshot stabilization Lens hood with lock button and filter opening 27 lens elements in 19 groups 6 extra low dispersion glass elements to control chromatic aberration, flare and ghosting 11 blade circular aperture Internal focusing and zooming Weather and dust sealing Weight – 2470 g The lens is priced at $2,899.99 and is available to pre-order.
