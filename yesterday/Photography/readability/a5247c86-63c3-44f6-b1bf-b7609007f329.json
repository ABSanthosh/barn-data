There has been a loose roadmap for 2025 that has been given to one authorized retailer we know of.We initially reported to expect an announcement in Q1 of this year, but that has obviously changed. It looks like Canon is all in on APS-C for Q1.Specifications haven’t changed all that much since the rumored specifications last year. We don’t put a lot of stock in detailed specifications so far in advance of an announcement.New Canon RF LensesWe don’t have any information of what two lenses we’ll see alongside the Canon EOS R6 Mark III.Canon EOS R6 Mark III Rumored SpecificationsThere will be a couple of Canon feature firsts we have been told. It looks like the 6 series is going to be used to bring new features to the EOS R lineup. For example, the EOS R6 Mark II was the first EOS R camera with precapture.We’re told that Canon has a new flippy screen design that mimics recent Sony mirrorless cameras. It will flip out for the usual selfie rotation, as well as up and down without flipping it out.We’ve also been told that this will be the first Canon camera with an OLED external screen. This feature I would put at 50/50 of happening. I’m not sure OLED external screens are a needed feature, even if it would be cool.SummaryThere’s not much new to report as far as specifications go. We still expect it to see a 24mp stacked sensor that would be related to the sensor in the Canon EOS R3.We also expect a move to at least one CFexpress Type B card slot, it’s time.We’re going to see the DIGIC Accelerator and it will have the autofocus system from the EOS R5 Mark II. We don’t expect to see eye-control autofocus.We think you can basically expect a lot of the features we already see in the latest Canon full-frame cameras.We’d be surprised if there were any real surprises, and we’re going to get what we expect.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...
