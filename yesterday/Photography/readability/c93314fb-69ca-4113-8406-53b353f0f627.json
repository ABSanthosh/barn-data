  "description": "Although weâ€™ve talked about Virtual Copies here on the blog, I havenâ€™t done anything about them recently for people new to Lightroom Classic, so today thatâ€™s what weâ€™re doing. So, when would Virtual Copies come in handy? Well, what if you wanted to see different versions or edits of the same photo? Maybe you edit one so itâ€™s in black and white, and maybe another version with a color tint, and then a real contrasty version, and maybe a version that was cropped differently, so you can pick the one that looks best to you? What might keep you from doing that is having to duplicate that high-resolution file every time you wanted to try a different look because it would eat up hard drive space like nobodyâ€™s business. Luckily, you can create virtual copies, which really donâ€™t take up space (well, maybe the size of a thumbnail, soâ€¦basically nothing) and allow you to try out different looks and versions, side-by-side, without any of the file size overhead. STEP ONE: You create a virtual copy by Right-clicking on the original photo and then choosingÂ Create Virtual CopyÂ from the pop-up menu (as shown here), or using the keyboard shortcutÂ Command-â€™Â (apostrophe;Â PC: Ctrl-â€™). These virtual copies look and act the same as your original photo, and you can edit them just as you would your original, but hereâ€™s the difference: itâ€™s not a real file; itâ€™s just a set of instructions, so it doesnâ€™t add any real file size. That way, you can have as many of these virtual copies as you want, and experiment to your heartâ€™s content without filling up your hard disk. STEP TWO: When you create a virtual copy, youâ€™ll know which version is the copy because the virtual copies have a curled page icon in the lower-left corner of the image thumbnail (circled in red here) in both the Grid view and in the Filmstrip. So now, go ahead and tweak this virtual copy in the Develop module any way you want (here, I increased the Clarity and added an edge vignette using the Effects panel). When you return to the Grid view, youâ€™ll see the original and the edited virtual copy (as seen here). STEP THREE: Now, you can experiment away with multiple virtual copies of your original photo at no risk to your original photo or your hard drive space. So, click on your first virtual copy, then press Command-â€™ (PC: Ctrl-â€™) to make another virtual copy (thatâ€™s rightâ€”you can make virtual copies of your virtual copy), and then head over to the Develop module, and make some adjustments (here, I lowered the Vibrance a bit; lowered the Highlights and the contrast and opened up the Shadows a bit). Now, make some more copies to experiment with (I made a few more copies and changed the creative profiles for each one, making a couple of black and whites as well).Â  Note:Â When you make a copy, you can hit the Reset button at the bottom of the right side Panels area to return the virtual copy to its original unedited look. Also, you donâ€™t have to jump back to the Grid view each time to make a virtual copyâ€”that keyboard shortcut works in the Develop module, too. STEP FOUR: Now, if you want to compare all your experimental versions side by side, go back to the Grid view, select your original photo and all the virtual copies, and then press the letterÂ NÂ on your keyboard to enter Survey view (as shown here). If thereâ€™s a version you really like, of course, you can just leave it alone and then delete the other virtual copies you donâ€™t like. (Note:Â To delete a virtual copy, click on it and press the Delete [PC: Backspace] key, and then click Remove in the dialog that appears.) If you take this virtual copy over to Photoshop or export it as a JPEG or TIFF from within Lightroom, it goes to the original file to create a real copy of the image using the settings you applied to the virtual copy. Pretty cool, huh? Hope you found that helpful, and I hope you give these Virtual Copies a try. ðŸ™‚ -Scott The post When Lightroomâ€™s Virtual Copies Can Really Come In Handy appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",
