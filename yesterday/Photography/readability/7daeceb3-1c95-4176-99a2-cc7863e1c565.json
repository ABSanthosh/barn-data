We’re going to get the Canon EOS R50 V and Canon EOS RV sometime soon. We’re also expecting an updated Canon EOS R7 later this year.With those sorts of APS-C cameras on the horizon, we’re going to be getting at least 3-4 new RF-S lenses.We also expect the Canon EOS R6 Mark III to be the big full-frame camera announcement for photographers and videographers alike. Though we do think that there is something else cooking besides just the much rumored “retro” camera.New Canon RF-S Lenses in 2025We are going to get at least 2 RF-S Power Zoom lenses for the new segment of APS-C cameras. We expect wide-angle and a standard zoom pair of PZ lenses.We are also expecting a new fast prime lens for the RF-S mount. I don’t think anyone would be upset to see an RF mount version of the much-loved EF-M 32mm f/1.4 STM.Canon EF-M 32mm f/1.4 STMAlso rumored is an RF-S f/2.8 constant aperture zoom. We think it’ll be something like the EF 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM. We’re told that it’ll start wider than the 17mm of the EF version of the lens. Going to 15mm would give the RF-S lineup a 24-70mm 35mm equivalent lens.We will hopefully be able to update the lenses that are coming in the very near future, for the moment we must be somewhat ambiguous.Read between the lines a bit.New Canon RF Lenses in 2025There have been a few lenses which have been rumored for as long as I can remember. Everything based on our experience says they are coming, but none of them have come to market yet. It has been frustrating.The autofocus tilt-shift lenses really need to come to market. One of Canon’s strengths in the EF days was their tilt-shift lenses. They are the sort of lenses that will bring certain types of photographers into the system.Canon EF 200-400mm f/4L IS USM 1.4xThe last one on the list……Canon TS-R 14mm f/4LCanon TS-R 24mm f/3.5LCanon RF 200-500mm f/4L IS USM (Perhaps with a TC)Canon has said in the past that they want to release 8 or so lenses a year for the foreseeable future. If everything mentioned here comes to market in 2025, that only leaves one or two more lenses that could be announced if Canon holds true to those plans.New “Big White” Prime LensesWe don’t think Canon will replace their RF 400mm f/2.8L IS USM and RF 600mm f/4L IS USM this year, and Canon will wait until early 2026 at the earliest to do that. 2026 is a World Cup and Olympic year. They always makes a splash for those events.Is An Astrophotographer Dream Lens Coming?We do think we’re finally going to see a fast ultra-wide L prime lens. The astrophotography world has been asking for one for years now. We have seen the patents for these designs and believe this is the year we’re going to see. We have been told one will come in the 2nd half of 2025 from a source with mixed success.Sigma 14mm f/1.4 DG DN ArtIn ClosingThere are some known truths in the report above, but we can’t write what some of the exact products will be at this time. This is normal, and by now, we should all be aware of how closed Canon has become over the last few years when it comes to leaks.There are going to be a dozen or so desires in the forum thread attached to this post, and a few of them that are going to be mentioned are likely to come one day. Well, the desires that fit the laws of logic and physics.However, Canon must put some focus into their coming revamped APS-C camera lineup and that means new and very good RF-S lenses have to be launched with cameras like the EOS R50 V, EOS RV and EOS R7 Mark II.Just to put some good vibes out there. We’d love to be surprised by a photography focused lens or two. A Canon RF 35mm f/1.2L USM anyone? Even if an RF 28mm f/1.2L (oooh!) USM would be a much better lens to make (if you know, you know).When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
