Before we get into it, we should note that Canon didn’t have anything new until the late summer, and these rankings tend to favour recency.Most surprising, though, is how well Fujifilm did for sales for Map Camera in 2024, taking 3 out of the top 5 positions, with the number 1 item going to the Fujifilm X100IV. I understand this is a very difficult camera to get a hold of, as it’s continually being sold out. So well done, Fujifilm. If only we had a Canonet.The top rankings for 2024 are as follows;Fujifilm X100IVFujifilm X-T50Sony A7CIINikon ZfFujifilm X-T5Z6 IIISony A7 IVCanon R6 Mark IICanon R5 Mark IINikon Z8Nikon did well with 3 overall, and you have to go all the way down to 8th position before you see Canon (Yes, they are doomed). The R5 Mark II making the top 10 is rather impressive, considering it wasn’t shipping until October.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.",
