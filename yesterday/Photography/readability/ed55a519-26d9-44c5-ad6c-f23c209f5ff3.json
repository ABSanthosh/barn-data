There is speculation, but we’ll wait to wait for actual information.We have been told Canon plans to release two versions of the next Canon EOS R7. One will be video-focused, perhaps called the Canon EOS R7 V, and the other photography-focused. The EOS R7 Mark II will potentiall be something like a baby EOS R1 with an APS-C sensor.During the EF days, the Canon EOS 7D series was pretty close to a baby version of the EOS-1D X line. We’d love to see that return to the lineup.I think the Canon EOS R50 V will give us some idea of what Canon has planned for these “V” series RF mount cameras.It’s interesting to see “V” come up for PowerShot as well as EOS R.I’d grab the salt shaker for now on this information.
