  "description": "I once won a photography competition with a $50 camera, so no, gear doesn’t matter. I could end this article right here, except gear does matter in many circumstances. So when I see the arguments on social media about this subject, it always seems to be painted in black and white, clearly, it isn't. Today I want to explore this area a little more and look at why the “gear (doesn’t) matter\" argument is much more nuanced than social media would suggest. The post Does Gear Really Matter in Photography? It’s Not That Simple appeared first on Light Stalking.",
