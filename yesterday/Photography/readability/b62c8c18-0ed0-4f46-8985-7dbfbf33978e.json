Not many companies manufacture film cameras but there are a lot of trusted sites that sell used cameras. One of the companies that still sells analog cameras is Leica and they are launching their own black and white film, the Leica MONOPAN 50. Image via Leica Leica mentions, With its distinctive look, our Leica MONOPAN 50 black-and-white film recalls the early days of 35 mm photography. It takes us back to 1925, when we presented the revolutionary Leica I to the world. The Leica MONOPAN 50 film allows 36 high resolution shots, since it has ultra fine grain and super panchromatic sensitivity. The resulting images are amazingly sharp with great tonal range. The film can be processed in all developers available to develop black and white film. As the name suggests, the iso sensitivity for the Monopan 50 film is at 50 which means it can be used to capture images in bright light conditions using a wide aperture value. It can be a perfect film to use with the fast M-lenses of Leica's analog cameras. Here is a summary of the film specifications: Type of film – Black and White Number of frames – 36 Iso sensitivity – 50 Resolution – 280 line pairs/mm Sensitivity – super panchromatic 780nm Price is about $12 Can be developed in all developers for black and white film The specifications for the Monopan 50, match the ones for Adox HR-50. Leica has also mentioned that the enhanced spectral sensitivity of the Leica MONOPAN 50 film makes it a great choice for infra-red photography. The film can also be used along with Leica's yellow, orange and green color filters, to capture high depth, contrast, tonal values and character in black and white images. More details about the Leica Monopan 50 film can be found here and the film will be available from August 21, 2025. We have more news for you to read if you are interested at this link here.",
