  "description": "Erik Kuna and I am back from an amazing week in Tokyo with 13 wonderful photographers. Man, we had an incredible experience – tons of photo opportunities, great food, great people (love the Japanese people), and a really great culture, lots of laughs and fun, and we even took a photo or two, all in an absolutely incredible place. If you’ve got a minute, here’s a link to some of my favorite images from the week, the story of it all, and some behind-the-scenes photos. Here’s the link. Next, here’s an absolutely fantastic new video from Terry White on 5 ways to speed up Lightroom Classic, and this is so helpful – SO helpful. If you’ve got a sec, check it out (it could save your hours. Heck, days!). Kick butt video, right? Thanks, Terry. 🙂 The Big Photography Show Coming To New York This Summer – It’s B\u0026H Photo’s BILD Expo And I’m thrilled to be one of their speakers again this year. The BILD Expo, produced by the folks at B\u0026H Photo, is an incredible event, with a stellar collection of instructors, tons of industry vendors and camera manufacturers, and a bunch of training tracks.
