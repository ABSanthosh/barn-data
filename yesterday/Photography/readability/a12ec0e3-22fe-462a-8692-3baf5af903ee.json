  "text": "Polaroid, the company famous for its instant film and cameras has released a new instant camera, the Polaroid Flip. The camera comes with features like sonar autofocus and scene analysis that can help prevent exposure and focus issues. Image via Polaroid The camera comes with a hyperfocal 4 lens system that helps to capture sharp shots every time. The sonar autofocus system ensures that the subject being captured is always in focus. And, the scene analysis feature helps with capturing shots that are correctly exposed, avoiding over or underexposure. The in-built flash is powerful and helps with capturing images under any light conditions. The flip design means, the camera lens can be protected from dust and other elements when not in use outdoors. The new polaroid flip can be used to capture images of all genre, from landscapes, long exposures to streets and portraits. The LED display helps with checking the battery levels, modes, film counts, etc., when needed. The viewfinder LED alerts you if you are too close to the subject or if there is not enough light in the scene. Here are some of the most important features of this camera: Flip open lid LED display for modes, film counts and battery level Viewfinder LED warning for scene analysis – alerts for under or overexposure Sonar autofocus to keep the subject in focus Powerful built-in flash 4 lens system (two lens structures with 4 zones) Tripod mount Lens filter snap Compatible with Polaroid i-Tyype and 600 film The camera will be available to purchase by mid May from retailers or by the end of April from the Polaroid store if you become a Polaroid member. More about this camera can be found here. We have more news for you to read if you are interested, at this link here.",
