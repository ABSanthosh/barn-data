Photo by Waldemar Yet it’s also an increasingly popular medium, so much so that storied brand name Kodak is revamping its film production to meet the increasing demand for the once-dominant medium. The company recently shut down its New York factory to upgrade its production facilities for film. This news was heralded in the community as a great sign, particularly when we are so accustomed to seeing tales of decline in the camera segment.  The Verge quotes Kodak CEO Jim Continenza who, during a third quarter earnings call for the company, described the update process at the Rochester film factory. “Our film sales have increased on motion picture and in still film and other films. So on film, we’re doing a shutdown in November, total shutdown…We’ve continued to invest in our manufacturing process, while we need to shut down completely to bring light into the dark, right? Film is made in the dark.” The revamp at the Rochester factory is also being taken as a serious sign of commitment on the company’s part to keep manufacturing film for photographers and videographers as long as the demand is there. While there is certainly a trend towards digital, the full embrace of the modern format isn’t shared by all and, for those people, film is probably not going anywhere anytime soon. Continenza outlined during the call how the company stocked up on inventory ahead of the shutdown to make sure that current supply chains face minimal disruption during the factory’s short but necessary upgrade process.  Any thoughts that you might have on the resurgent popularity of film are welcome in the comments.
