Photo by Voyage Pro But there might be a grain of truth to all of that when you read stories like today’s latest from the AI wave. An AI-powered camera operator is taking aim at social media creators even though its applications are actually much, much broader. Roll Cam AI shows off a variety of use case scenarios including the aforementioned social media content creation as well as real estate agents. You can watch a video over on YouTube about the Roll Cam AI and its initial specs at this link. What is it? Basically, as multiple websites are pointing out, it is a tripod on wheels that uses AI to keep subjects in frame. It can support everything from traditional cameras to smartphones and is still in the development stages pending a launch on Kickstarter in March. The company is asking users to sign up for a VIP list, promising initial enlistees a 65% discount on the device when it launches which puts it at $USD 259 (or over $USD 700 without the discount we estimate). Roll Cam AI promises a variety of tracking modes and options when it comes to filming. And if users want to take control of everything themselves, the company is also promising and manual mode to let users control the mobile tripod. The device promises smooth, quiet movement at up to 5 mph which seems fast enough for its stated use case scenarios as well as approximating what a human camera operator could accomplish. Any thoughts on an AI-powered camera operator are welcome in the comments. We have some other articles for you to read at this link.
