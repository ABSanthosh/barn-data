  "text": "Motorized Precision announced Evo, a compact, portable cinema robot that folds up so small that it can fit in a hard case. The latest in a line of cinema innovations announced at NAB 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada, the Evo is a cinebot that maker, Motorized Precision, promises is its most versatile yet. The Evo is powered by Motorized Precision’s proprietary intuitive motion control software, either the MP Studio Lite essential option best for creators on a budget, or the more powerful MP Studio Pro for “demanding workflows, multi-robot support, virtual production ready, and unlimited keyframes.” Evo works with standard video game controllers to ensure user-friendliness and fun operation. It even supports hand-guided moves, with the ability to grab and move Evo to initiate and record motion paths quickly. Motorized Precision writes, “Evo puts affordable cinematic motion control in your hands. Built from the same DNA as our premium robots, Evo delivers precise, repeatable camera moves in a compact package. Ideal for YouTubers, indie filmmakers, and studios on a budget, Evo seamlessly works with MP Studio Pro or Lite software. Customize your Evo to fit your unique needs and budget.” Customization is available as software upgrades such as scene control, timelapse, additional virtual production tools, and added controls from gripper to in and output. Hardware upgrades include a three-channel FIZ kit, one-channel FIZ kit, DMX interface, input and output interface kit, and turntable kit. Mounting options finish the customization of Evo units with the choice of gripper, bottom adaptor plate, and Mitchell mount, or camera adaptor plate and LR-50 clamp. The customizable Evo has a base weight of 44 pounds (20 kilograms) and can support payloads up to 11 pounds (five kilograms). Fully extended, the cinebot is four feet (1.2 meters) tall, not including a tripod or support, with a reach from the center of 2.79 feet (0.85 meters). Motorized Precision promises that the Evo is plug-and-play, set up in minutes for filmmakers on the go. With its compact design, the unit fits into a case, with the option to add on a custom-cut foam-filled hard case. Portability is further supported by the cinebots ability to run on 110v/220v power or even off-grid via a portable AC generator. Pricing and Availability Pre-orders for the Evo have begun with prices starting at $10,000 for the base model and will ship in waves. The required software packages are an additional $5,000 for MP Studio Lite or $15,000 for MP Studio Pro. Either software choice required an additional yearly subscription to a support and update plan at $2,000 for MP Studio Lite or $15,000 for MP Studio Pro, as shown above.
