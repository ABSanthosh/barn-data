The Canon PowerShot V1 was announced in Asia as you know, but when it will come to the rest of the world could be up in the air.We noticed today that B\u0026H Photo pulled their Canon PowerShot V1 listing. We think there are a couple of possible reasons.Canon USA may have requested it be pulled down since it has not been officially announced in the United States. Or it could be an issue with where it’s made and Canon has to see how those challenges play out.The Canon PowerShot V1 has been presented to US retailers and the pricepoint was set at $899 USD. We’re going to have to wait and see how this plays out.We’re not really providing anything new beyond a few tidbits, it’s just good to do a round-up every now and then. The EOS R6 Mark III will be a big camera launch and we’re seeing some hints of it coming in the near future.Canon EOS R6 Mark IIIThe long rumored Canon EOS R6 Mark III is scheduled to arrive some time in Q2 of this year. The announcement timeframe has bounced between Q1 and Q2 from conflicting reports, but we’d be surprised if it was announced in the second half of 2025The current Canon EOS R6 Mark II is once again see drop in MSRP down to $2199 USD and there is also a $200 instant rebate to bring it back down to $1999, which is where it was fod a good chunk of time in 2024.The drop of the MSRP is a good sign that a replacement is on the horizon. It’s not always 100% accurate, but it is more often than not.Canon RF 200-500mm f/4L IS USMThis lens has become fantasy for a lot of us and there are so many conflicting reports about it now. I have heard everything that it’s actually an f/5.6 all the way to it having a built-in 1.4x teleconverter.This is one of those lenses that is just going to drive us crazy and we’re not really into reporting on it until we get some confirmations.This is one of the frustrations that the rumor world goes through sometimes, it’s not the first time and it won’t be the last.Canon RF 28-70mm f/2L USMCanon RF 24-70mm f/2L USMThis is an interesting one. We recently saw Sony announce a much lighter and smaller 28-70mm f/2 GM and perhaps Canon has their own follow-up coming?I have been told twice that the follow-up to the RF 28-70mm f/2L USM will be 24mm at the wide-end and still trim significant weight off the current lens.There has been no suggestion on when we may see such a lens, but we hope this brings out further information as can happen sometimes.We already saw Canon bring a new RF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM Z with a different design, so there’s precedent of Canon changing or upgrading original RF lenses.Canon Autofocus Tilt-Shift LensesThese have been rumored for as long as I can remember, and we have seen plenty of patents for electronically driven tilt-shift lenses.The wait could be software related with the cameras that are going to be compatible with all the features that will be coming.We have no expected arrival, but the line-up needs tilt-shift lenses, it was one of things that drew people to the EF mount and Canon.Canon EOS R50 VWe only have this camera in name, but it comes from a pretty reliable source. We don’t have any sort of specifications and we haven’t seen anything visual.Canon APS-C LineupI can’t say too much at this time, but there should be information soon that we can share about the next EOS R7 and another APS-C camera. The APS-C line-up is definitely going to look at different by the end of 2025.Canon AE-1Canon Retro CameraThis is coming, we can feel it. The Canon executive speak about such a camera was pretty telling if you have experience reading between the lines.My favorite is the AE-1 – for myself, that would be my choice. But whether as a company, as the Canon brand, we would revive that in digital format or not is a different topic. So I cannot make any clear comments on that, unfortunately, but my personal preference is the AE-1. https://www.canonrumors.com/canon-possibility-of-a-retro-camera/The 50th anniversaty of the Canon AE-1 is next year, so an announcement in Q4 would make a lot of sense. We’re rolling with the camera being called the Canon RE-1, it just makes sense.Love or hate the idea of a throwback camera, we think it’ll do exceptionally well.Canon RF 28-70mm f/2.8 IS STMSummary2025 will be a busy year for Canon, and we’ll be seeing a few new lines and we expect 6-8 new lenses this year along with 4-5 RF mount camera bodies.It wouldn’t surprise us to see a telephoto f/2.8 to match the RF 16-24mm f/2.8 IS STM and the RF 28-70mm f/2.8 IS STM. The latter being a lens that I quickly fell in love with. A trinity of relatively affordable lenses would be great for the line-up. We hope to see some rebates on those lenses in the near future. We think they’d be a great value when they’re under $1000.There will be more to come in the very near future.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
