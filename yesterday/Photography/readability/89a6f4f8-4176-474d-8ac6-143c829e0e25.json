I don’t care about being wrong in that regard.We have been told that there will be another PowerShot camera in the second half of 2025 and it will be some kind of replacement for the PowerShot SX70 HS.If you don’t know the camera specs, it’s a 20mp fixed lens camera with a 65x zoom with a 21mm-1365mm focal length (35mm equivalent).We are told not to expect that kind of range. I doubt we’ll see something as silly as 1300mm, especially if it comes with a larger than 1″ sensor. I think you’ll be fine in the 600mm-800mm range on the long end.The image sensor for the PowerShot cameras will be Canon made. That question keeps coming up, so we’ll keep writing it.We don’t know what the full roadmap for PowerShot cameras will be. It may be a case of seeing how the market actually responds to these new cameras. How Canon fits them into the vlogging world will also be interesting.If the current demand for the PowerShot G7 X Mark III is any indication, the new PowerShot cameras will be very well received.More to come…When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.Go to discussion...",
