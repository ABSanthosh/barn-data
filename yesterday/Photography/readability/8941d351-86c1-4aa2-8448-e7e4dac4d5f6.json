  "text": "Professional sports are almost always photographed with digital cameras these days, but this week one photographer decided to do something unusual: not only did he shoot an NFL football game on 35mm film, but he developed, scanned, and posted the photos before the game had even ended. Photographer Miles Myerscough-Harris attended the Monday Night Football game on October 14th between the New York Jets and the Buffalo Bills at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. His equipment of choice was a Canon EOS 1-V 35mm film SLR camera loaded with Kodak Portra 800 color negative film. His lenses of choice were the 18-35mm f/2.8, 70-200mm f/2.8, and 300mm f/4. After filling up some rolls of film, Myerscough-Harris passed them onto Will of Analogue Wonderland (an online film retailer), who processed the film during halftime in a backstage bathroom of the stadium. Development was done using the AGO Film Processor, a $479 automated system for B\u0026W, C-41, and E-6 films.
