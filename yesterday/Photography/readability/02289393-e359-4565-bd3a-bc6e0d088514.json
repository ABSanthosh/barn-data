Photo by Semeon Hrozian Talk about a small step for Google, but a giant leap for smartphone kind. The camera bump is a constant reminder of how sophisticated smartphone cameras are as well as how design cannot overcome the limitations of physics. Let’s face it, cameras are sophisticated pieces of kit whether enhanced by processing power or not. Well, today we have an interesting piece of news as MacRumors reports that Apple is far from abandoning the camera bump with its next iPhone. Even so, you can still say goodbye to the camera bump. And say hello to the camera bar. That’s right, the camera bump is now a full-length bar of wizardry at the top of the next-generation iPhone.  Really, no one is shocked given the arms race in that market. Increasingly sophisticated technology would require more of a footprint the thinking goes. Even so, Apple is known for leading in terms of design and there are more than a few rumors about the next iPhone in this regard. Another rumor is a so-called iPhone Air which is an ultrathin model allegedly sporting only one camera. Whether that is actually coming will be a question time will answer but all of this is highlighting the fact that, bar some kind of revolutionary tech, the camera bump might not be going away any time soon.  Another thing to consider is that, as consumers seek more sophisticated cameras, more of them will likely turn to the more traditional models we know and love so perhaps this is a rising tide floats all boats situation.  You can watch a video on YouTube about the upcoming iPhone at this link. Your thoughts on the camera bar, camera bump, or flush design are welcome in the comments.  We have some other news at this link.
