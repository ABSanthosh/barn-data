  "description": "It just came out a few weeks ago, and it’s in bookstores now. Check out the short video below, where I explain what the book is all about. You can get your copy at Amazon (link), Barnes \u0026 Noble (link), or directly from the publisher, Rocky Nook (link). It’s available in Print [it’s beautiful in print] and eBook versions. Hope you give it a look. Have a great weekend, everybody. All of my teams are already out of the playoffs or College Championship, so I’ll be….well….rooting for some team I don’t really care about all that much. I guess I’m going in on the Lions since they’ve never won a Super Bowl, and I like their coach. So, #GoLions, I guess. -Scott P.S. If you’re not rooting for any teams this weekend, you know what might be a lot of fun instead? Reading a good photography technique book. (hint, hint).
