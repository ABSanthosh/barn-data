  "text": "The World Photography Organisation unveiled the 10 category winners for this year’s Sony World Photography Awards. Now in its 18th year, photographers from over 200 countries submitted over 419,000 images to the 2025 Sony World Photography Awards competition. The prestigious photo contest includes Professional and Open categories. The Professional segment awards photographers for cohesive series of photos, while the Open contest celebrates the best single images. “The Open competition celebrates the ability of an individual photograph to capture and distil a singular moment, and to evoke a broader narrative,” the World Photography Organisation explains. The 10 categories in the Sony World Photography Awards 2025 include architecture, creative, landscape, lifestyle, motion, natural world and wildlife, object, portraiture, street photography, and travel. All category winners are featured below.
