The lens looks to perform quite well, especially considering the relatively low price of $329. Canon RF-S 14-30mm F4-6.3 is STM PZ5APS-C | f/4-6.3 to f/22-3622-48mm (Full-Frame Equivalent)STM Focusing Motor with Power ZoomBuilt-In Optical StabilizationMinimum Focus Distance: 5.9\"Click-Stop Control Ring A versatile, video-ready zoom in a compact package, the Canon RF-S 14-30mm f/4.5-6.3 IS STM PZ Lens is made specifically for use as a kit lens for the APS-C-format R50 V mirrorless camera, where it delivers a wide-angle to short telephoto equivalent zoom range of 22-48mm. Fully compatible with any other RF-mount body, the lens has both power zoom functionality and image stabilization to deliver optimal results when shooting video. Canon has taken care with the optical design, using two aspherical elements, an ultra-low dispersion element, and Super Spectra Coating to minimize aberrations and reduce ghosting and flare. The small form factor and 5.9″ minimum focus distance make it useful for intimate portraits in tight spaces. The built-in image stabilizer will also work with Movie Digital IS in compatible bodies like the R50 V. Additionally, the lead screw-type STM AF system is fast enough to keep up with speedy continuous focus while being smooth and quiet enough to work for video. Summary According to the results at The-Digital-Picture, the RF-S 14-30mm f/4-6.3 IS STM PZ is going to have good value performance especially for video. Photographers are also going to be happy with the price, size and optical performance.
