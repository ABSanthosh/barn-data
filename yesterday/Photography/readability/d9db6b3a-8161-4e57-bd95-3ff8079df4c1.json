Even those lucky enough to be talented enough to play for organized teams probably didn’t go on to be a champion – or even a professional.But for budding photographers, there is still a chance to be involved in the world of sports thanks to your other passion. You may not make the headlines of the sports pages or feature on the top online betting sites but you can be as close up to the action as it gets without actually playing – and you won’t even have to pay for your ticket.Sports photography mixes two great interests and creates some of the most stunning images ever produced. You don’t even have to be a fan to appreciate some of the most famous sports photographs of all time but there is more to becoming a sports photographer than just liking sports and owning a camera. Here are some tips on getting ahead in the game.Know Your SportIt isn’t an absolute prerequisite that you play or even understand the sport you are going to be capturing. But it will really help with your final images if you do know the sport well. Just like any kind of subject, you will be able to get the best shots if you have some kind of idea of what is going on in front of your eyes.This basic knowledge is even more important when it comes to sports, if anything. If you have studied the sport in question – or even just watched a lot of it – you will be able to better predict what might happen. If you understand the game, you can set yourself up well to capture the special moments.Use the Right EquipmentAlthough technology has advanced to the point that we can now use the phones in our pockets to capture incredible shots, if you are serious about sports photography you should really get the best equipment possible. It doesn’t always have to be expensive – and Canon is great for cameras and other necessities.You will need a DSLR camera with autofocus so you don’t have to waste time and miss split-second opportunities. A high shooting speed is obviously preferred, while telephoto and wide-aperture lenses will work depending on what kind of shot you are aiming for. Monopods are also better than tripods, purely for ease of use and movement.Pick Your PositionIf you have ever watched sports on TV – as you most definitely should have if you want to be a sports photographer – you will have probably seen cameras positioned at the end of the field of play or court. That’s because that is where most of the action happens in most sports – and those are the images the media wants.But there are other options for any budding sports photographer looking to carve a niche for themselves in the business. Elevated views are good for getting a wide range of images and subjects, especially away from the action (which we will look at in a moment). Look for the less popular positions and you might be able to get a unique shot.Look Away from the ActionIf you have a brief to capture the most important action at a sports event then you probably want to focus on the athletes scoring the goals, touchdowns, runs, or baskets. But the world of sports is so interesting because there is so much else going on in any stadium at any given event.While those with strict instructions can capture the main action, you can look away from the field altogether and find subjects and moments that may be even more interesting. The passion and drama of sports come as much from the fans as from the athletes, so looking at them is a good idea. Even just photographing stadiums can be a good idea if you find good light and interesting angles.Put the Hours InWe’re afraid there really is no way around it. Just like anything worth doing, sports photography is worth doing well – and that means putting the time in. You may have an exceptional natural talent for getting the best shot but you will only improve over time, getting as much practice as you can.Don’t worry if you are unable to get media access to professional sports events when you start out (because you probably won’t). Just go along to your local high school or club event. You will be able to hone your craft on a smaller stage and hopefully come away with a good enough portfolio that you can convince someone to pay for you to take photos at the Super Bowl in a few years’ time!Think About the StoryThey say a picture tells a thousand stories but it is so much more than that really. Photography is all about telling a story and with sports photography you are telling a story about something at the event. That doesn’t have to be the game-winning touchdown but anyone who is lucky enough to see your image will understand the story being told.Sports photography isn’t easy but it can be hugely rewarding and allows those involved to enjoy sports in a way that no one else can. Always be looking for the right image that can tell the story you think is important – and you won’t go far wrong.When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.",
