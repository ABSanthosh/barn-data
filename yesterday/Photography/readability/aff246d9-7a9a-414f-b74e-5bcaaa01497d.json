The lens is lighter, weighing at about 1340g. This the company's second f/2 zoom lens in the GM series. The zoom range of this lens, 50-150mm and the f/2 fixed aperture along the entire zoom range, makes it a great lens for wedding, portrait and event photographers where the subject can be isolated with a shallow depth of field. Unfortunately the lens does not have internal image stabilization. Image via Sony Similar to Sony's range of G Master series of other lenses, the FE 50-150mm f2 GM lens produces stunning images of very high resolution and beautifully smooth bokeh. This will make this lens a great choice for professional photographers who already work with the Sony Alpha camera system. This lens will also be a great choice for professional video makers because of its stunning cinematic results and great clarity. The lens comes with Nano anti-reflection coating, that will help to reduce flare and ghosting significantly even in backlit situations. The lens also comes with four extreme dynamic linear motors for faster and accurate focusing. Some of the most important features of this lens are: Focal length – 50 to 150mm, E mount lens Maximum aperture – f/2 Aperture blades – 11, rounded aperture Lens elements – 19 elements in 17 groups Filter size – 95mm Image stabilization – No Internal focusing and zooming – Yes Aperture, focus and zoom rings Weather and dust sealed Weight – 1340g The lens seems to be quite expensive, priced at $3,899.99 and is available to pre-order now. The estimated shipping date is towards the end of May, 2025. More details about this lens can be found here. We have more news for you to read if you are interested at this link here.",
