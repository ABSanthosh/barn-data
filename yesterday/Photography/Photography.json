    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/want-to-get-creative-with-your-white-balance-this-tip-can-help-you-find-the-best-look/",
    "description": "So, here’s the scenario: you’re not looking for an accurate white balance – instead, you want to try something creative, but you’re not sure which white balance setting you might like best. This is where Virtual Copies (and another great Lightroom feature we’ll talk about in just a sec) come in really handy.  First, if you’re not familiar with Virtual Copies, here’s a quick glimpse at what they are, and we’ll use Photoshop as an example. If you were to open a 50-megapixel image in Photoshop and you want to compare that image with another copy of it, you would have to duplicate that image. That means you now have another 50-megabyte photo on your computer. You’ve literally doubled your file size just to see a second version of your image. In Lightroom, when you create a Virtual copy, it doesn’t duplicate the file. It essentially duplicates just the thumbnail, so it barely takes up any space at all. SoK you can make as many copies as you like, so you can compare them without really taking up any extra space. It’s why they’re called “virtual copies” — it doesn’t make a real copy. This will make more sense in just a moment. Follow along below: STEP ONE: Here’s our original image with our ‘As Shot’ white balance. To make a virtual copy, you simply right-click on the image (if you’re on a Mac and don’t have a 2nd mouse button, just Ctrl-click on it) and a menu appears (seen above). Choose ‘Create Virtual Copy’ as shown here. When you do this, if you look at your thumbnails in the Library Grid view (or down in the Filmstrip) you’ll see it created a thumbnail just to the right of the original and it looks exactly like another copy of your image file, but remember — it’s not — it’s just a virtual copy. It’s perfect for experimenting with things like White Balance. STEP TWO: Since this is a virtual copy, let’s experiment and choose a different white balance by dragging the Temperature and Tint sliders. Since we’re doing this on a Virtual Copy, it doesn’t affect our original at all. We’re just experimenting — our original remains untouched. STEP THREE: Let’s do it again. Let’s make another Virtual copy and try a different white balance. If you want an even faster way, there’s a keyboard shortcut. It’s Command-‘ on Mac or Ctrl-‘ on a Windows PC). Once your new virtual copy appears, in the Develop Module, drag the White Balance Temperature and Tint sliders around to come up with another white balance look for your image. STEP FOUR: You can repeat this process of making virtual copies and tweaking the white balance as many times as you like. Since these are all virtual, it doesn’t add any drive space or overhead to Lightroom. This is an unlimited experimentation time. STEP FIVE: Once you’ve got a bunch of ’em — all with different White Balances, here’s the fun part: Select them all, then press the letter ‘n’ on your keyboard to enter Lightroom’s Survey Mode, which arranges all your selected images on screen so you can see all the different looks, and find the one (or more) you like best. STEP SIX: Once you know which one you like, you can leave Survey mode by pressing ‘n’ again, and it returns you to the Grid View. Now, if you like, you can mark your favorite image as a 5-star, or give it a color label, a pick flag — something to mark it as your white balance choice. Now you can delete the other Virtual Copies if you want. Note: You can see which ones are virtual copies by looking in the bottom left corner of the thumbnail. If you see a turned-up page corner (I circled it above in red), it’s a virtual copy. Just click on any one you want to delete, then press the Delete key (Backspace on PC) to remove its thumbnail, and now it’s like it never happened. But what about that Virtual Copy — it’s not real, right? What if you want to print that one you liked or export it outside of Lightroom? How do you make it into a real file? Well, here’s the good news — you don’t have to do anything. Lightroom treats it like it’s a real file, and when you want to export it from Lightroom using the Export feature (maybe you want to upload it to your portfolio or Instagram or Facebook), it automatically calls on the original file to create a real image for you, so it looks and acts like the real thing all the way through saving or printing. This is just another reason I love virtual copies (and survey mode, too!). Have a great weekend, everybody! 🙂 -Scott P.S. Don’t forget – the Lightroom Conference is next week!

    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",
