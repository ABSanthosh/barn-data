This is next level stuff – check out the video below: Pretty mind blowing stuff, right? That’s me teaching in Adobe’s booth last week at “the Photography Show” (thanks to Allison Reber at Peakto) What a great show, and always an honor to speak for Adobe (I did a session called 20 Photoshop Tips in 20 Minutes), and one on using AI in Photoshop (and still sleep at night). I also did sessions on Lightroom in the Post Production theater, a talk on photography, and two book signings. It was a busy but super fun few days. Thanks to Linda Paulson and the whole Adobe team for another wonderful experience, and to Ruth and the awesome team at The Photography Show for having me speak at the show. I loved every minute of it! 🙂 Next year, the show moves from London back to the NEC in Birmingham. Have a great Monday everybody! -Scott The post Select Subject in Photoshop Just Got Crazy Better!

    "title": "When Lightroom’s Virtual Copies Can Really Come In Handy",
    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/when-lightrooms-virtual-copies-can-really-come-in-handy/",
    "description": "Although we’ve talked about Virtual Copies here on the blog, I haven’t done anything about them recently for people new to Lightroom Classic, so today that’s what we’re doing. So, when would Virtual Copies come in handy? Well, what if you wanted to see different versions or edits of the same photo? Maybe you edit one so it’s in black and white, and maybe another version with a color tint, and then a real contrasty version, and maybe a version that was cropped differently, so you can pick the one that looks best to you? What might keep you from doing that is having to duplicate that high-resolution file every time you wanted to try a different look because it would eat up hard drive space like nobody’s business. Luckily, you can create virtual copies, which really don’t take up space (well, maybe the size of a thumbnail, so…basically nothing) and allow you to try out different looks and versions, side-by-side, without any of the file size overhead. STEP ONE: You create a virtual copy by Right-clicking on the original photo and then choosing Create Virtual Copy from the pop-up menu (as shown here), or using the keyboard shortcut Command-’ (apostrophe; PC: Ctrl-’). These virtual copies look and act the same as your original photo, and you can edit them just as you would your original, but here’s the difference: it’s not a real file; it’s just a set of instructions, so it doesn’t add any real file size. That way, you can have as many of these virtual copies as you want, and experiment to your heart’s content without filling up your hard disk. STEP TWO: When you create a virtual copy, you’ll know which version is the copy because the virtual copies have a curled page icon in the lower-left corner of the image thumbnail (circled in red here) in both the Grid view and in the Filmstrip. So now, go ahead and tweak this virtual copy in the Develop module any way you want (here, I increased the Clarity and added an edge vignette using the Effects panel). When you return to the Grid view, you’ll see the original and the edited virtual copy (as seen here). STEP THREE: Now, you can experiment away with multiple virtual copies of your original photo at no risk to your original photo or your hard drive space. So, click on your first virtual copy, then press Command-’ (PC: Ctrl-’) to make another virtual copy (that’s right—you can make virtual copies of your virtual copy), and then head over to the Develop module, and make some adjustments (here, I lowered the Vibrance a bit; lowered the Highlights and the contrast and opened up the Shadows a bit). Now, make some more copies to experiment with (I made a few more copies and changed the creative profiles for each one, making a couple of black and whites as well).  Note: When you make a copy, you can hit the Reset button at the bottom of the right side Panels area to return the virtual copy to its original unedited look. Also, you don’t have to jump back to the Grid view each time to make a virtual copy—that keyboard shortcut works in the Develop module, too. STEP FOUR: Now, if you want to compare all your experimental versions side by side, go back to the Grid view, select your original photo and all the virtual copies, and then press the letter N on your keyboard to enter Survey view (as shown here). If there’s a version you really like, of course, you can just leave it alone and then delete the other virtual copies you don’t like. (Note: To delete a virtual copy, click on it and press the Delete [PC: Backspace] key, and then click Remove in the dialog that appears.) If you take this virtual copy over to Photoshop or export it as a JPEG or TIFF from within Lightroom, it goes to the original file to create a real copy of the image using the settings you applied to the virtual copy. Pretty cool, huh? Hope you found that helpful, and I hope you give these Virtual Copies a try. 🙂 -Scott The post When Lightroom’s Virtual Copies Can Really Come In Handy appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",

    "link": "http://strobist.blogspot.com/2024/06/ive-been-working-on-something.html",
    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",
