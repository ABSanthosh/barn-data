    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/delta-makes-the-difference/",
    "description": "By Larry Tiefenbrunn, MD CEO and inventor, Platypod Pro LLC  Don’t get me wrong. I absolutely love tripods. I personally own about a half a dozen of them of all different brands. I use them for studio work, group portraiture, even some product shots.   However, when I’m out and about, the last thing I want to do is carry around unnecessarily heavy equipment. And I certainly don’t want to be told by security guards (#TripodPolice) that I can’t use a tripod to take long exposures for whatever reasons they conjure up. A compact flat tripod that slips into my camera bag, that doesn’t take up the space of a telephoto lens, is why I invented the very first Platypod, and that is why I have dedicated 10 years of time to this company… so that I can share my idea with like-minded photographers.   After several iterations of “the world‘s most compact tripod base” I have taken the very best features of our patented designs, and coalesced them into what I believe is going to be the most popular tripod of its kind, the Platypod Delta. The triangular design, flip out legs and adaptations to straps and 1/4” threaded accessories make this the fastest and most versatile Platypod to date. You just add on your own tripod head to this plate, and you are ready to shoot photo or video. Don’t have a spare tripod head? Look at any of our Platyball ballhead models or the Platypod grip for your smart phone.  What is new and different about Delta?  Δ Flip out hinged spikes – when we introduced the recent Platypod eXtreme, everyone was so happy that they no longer had to insert each spike individually. They could now simply pull out the hinges and flip the spikes into place. Our previous hand sized model, the Platypod ultra also required the spikes to be carried in a separate wallet which was not as convenient. For Delta, we designed all new heavy duty hinges with adjustable tension (with included 2 mm Allen wrench). Three 1/4 inch threaded spikes take three or four seconds to deploy.   They also incorporate our unique nylon/silicone retractable feet to reveal the sharp spikes for stone and concrete, or conversely, to cover them with a soft rubber tip to protect delicate surfaces.  Δ Triangular design – All our previous designs relied upon a primarily four legged system for added stability. The sacrifice however was speed since on almost any uneven surface some degree of leg adjustment was necessary for balance as well as to avoid jitter. The three legged system allows instant stability upon spike deployment.  Δ Super lightweight design – at only 4.2 ounces including spikes and tips this is our most lightweight and compact Platypod with a substantially smaller surface area due to the aircraft like cut out design. We bumped up the thickness of the metal from 5 mm to 6 mm to maintain maximum strength and stability. Fits beautifully into any camera bag or your pocket.  What remains the same?  It is compatible with our entire product line and maintains the Platypod features our users love:  …and yes, it really does open beer bottles.  Delta is available for discounted pre-order via Kickstarter now through February 15, 2025 and later on at platypod.com   Platypod®?

    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",
