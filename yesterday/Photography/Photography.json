    "title": "Adding an Edge Effect in Lightroom Classic",
    "link": "https://lightroomkillertips.com/adding-edge-effects-to-your-image-in-lightroom-classic-2/",
    "description": "It seems like edge effects are making somewhat of a comeback (these things go in cycles), so I thought I cover how to use them inside of Lightroom Classic (this one requires Classic’s Print Module, even though you might not be making a Print, but you can use it anyway). This is super easy to do (even if you’re new to Photoshop). Here we go: STEP ONE: First, you’ll need an edge. You can download free edges from the Web (there are a ton of them out there for free download and use), or you can find loads of them on inexpensive stock sites. What we need to do is make the center of the edge image (that white area) transparent. So, to do that start by duplicating the background layer (press Command-J on Mac, or Ctrl-J on a Windows PC). Then, get the Magic Wand tool from the toolbar (as shown here) and click it once in the center of the image to select that entire white center area inside the edge (as seen here where the inside center white area of the edge is selected). STEP TWO: Once that white center area is selected, hide the background layer from view by clicking on the little “eye” icon to the left of its name over in the Layers panel. Now hit the Delete key and it deletes that white area you selected on the top layer. The gray and white checkerboard shows you which parts of the image are transparent, so as you can see, the entire area that was white, is now fully transparent. While you’re there, get the Crop tool and crop it fairly tight like you see here. Now, you can click and drag that original background layer (named Layer 1) into the trash can at the bottom of the Layers panel to delete it. STEP THREE: To keep that transparency intact when we go over to Lightroom, all we have to do is the save the Photoshop file as a PNG, so head over to Save As and when the Save As window opens, from the Format pop-up menu choose “PNG” as shown here. A PNG format options window will appear. Just choose, “Large Size” and will and click OK. STEP FOUR: Now to go Lightroom Classic and click on the Print module. Choose a template from the Template picker in the left side panels (I chose the Maximum Size template). Go to the Image Settings panel and turn on the Zoom to Fill checkbox (so your image fills the cell), then go to the Layout panel and use the Margin and Cell size sliders (as shown here) to get your image to the size and position on the page where you want it. STEP FIVE: Go to the Page panel and turn on the checkbox for Identity Plate. This is the feature we’re going to use to bring that transparent center edge image into Lightroom. Once you’ve turned the checkbox on, click anywhere inside that gray checkerboard area and a pop-up menu appears. Choose ‘Edit’ (as shown above). STEP SIX: Clicking ‘Edit’ brings up the Identity Plate Editor you see above. Since we’re going to use that edge graphic we edited in Photoshop, you’ll need to click the ‘Use a graphical identity plate’ button up top, and then click the ‘Locate File’ button (as shown here). This brings up a standard ‘Open” window, so navigate to wherever you saved that edge graphic and click the ‘Choose’ button.STEP SEVEN: This brings the edge image into Lightroom, and you can see the center of it is transparent because by default it appears over your image (as seen here), but of course, it probably won’t be the exact right size so in the next step we’ll resize it to fit your image. STEP EIGHT: You can use the corner handle that appear around your graphic to scale the edge down to size, and you can click and drag anywhere inside that border to reposition the edge so it fits your image. It only allows you to scale proportionally (so you can’t drag just drag one side or the other to move just that size), so you’ll want to make sure, back in Photoshop, that the center of the edge is the proper size to fit a digital image (Oh, now he tells me). Luckily, most edges you download will already be perfectly sized to fit a standard image. STEP NINE: When click off that border, the border handles are hidden from view and you see your final image (as seen above). To save this image as a JPEG, go to the Print Job panel (bottom of the right side panels), and from the ‘Print to’ pop-up menu choose “JPEG File.” That’s all there is to it. NOTE: You might be thinking, “Scott, I see in the Identity Plate area of the Page panel, there’s a checkbox for ‘Render behind image.’ Why can’t we skip the whole Photoshop transparency part and just bring in the edge and put it behind our image?” It’s because, while that sounds easier, it’s actually not. You’ll spend a lot of time futzing around with the margin sliders and cell sliders to get your image to fit properly (I’ve tried), and so this is actually a much faster, easier way. Plus, once you’ve saved that file with a transparent center, now you can skip the Photoshop part going forward and just pop this edge in anytime you want. OK, that’s a lot of steps for something so easy. It is, but again, part of it (the first three steps) you won’t have to do again – you’ve created a transparent center graphic you can use anytime without going to Photoshop again. Have a great Holiday weekend, everybody, and #GoBucs! -Scott The post Adding an Edge Effect in Lightroom Classic appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",

    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",
