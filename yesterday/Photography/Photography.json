    "description": "The Good News: On Monday, I wrote a post about my favorite underrated feature from Adobe June Lightroom update, which was the fact that they updated the workflow for the Noise Reduction feature, and that: (1) They moved it to a more discoverable place (the Detail Panel), and more importantly: (2) It no longer makes a 2nd copy of your Raw image and applies the noise reduction to this new DNG image. Now it doesn’t make a 2nd copy, and it applies it to your raw image just like any other edit. I love it! The Potentially Bad News: Depending on your workflow, this could be bad news, and here’s why: Using the old method, you could select more than one image at a time, apply noise reduction, and the whole process happened in the background, and you were free to keep editing other images. The new version broke that workflow, so if you select multiple photos and apply noise reduction, it no longer processes your images in the background. Instead, a progress bar comes up, and while it’s processing the images (which, as you know, can be a few minutes to a whole bunch of minutes, depending on the speed of your computer and how many images you’re applying it to), you can’t do anything else until it’s done. If you didn’t regularly batch process images for noise reduction, then this probably isn’t an issue at all (I never did more than the one image I was working on at the time, so it never was for me), but for some folks, this could really be an issue, and I totally get it. Some Potentially Good News: Adobe is very aware of the issue, and I imagine they are working on some sort of solution. I’ll be keeping an eye on the issue, and if I hear anything I can share, I’ll let you know, but in the meantime, I thought it was important to let you know about the issue, and that Adobe know about it. Important disclaimer: Anytime I mention Adobe and Lightroom in the same sentence, it triggers a small, special group of photographers who, after 12 long years, are still somehow holding out for Adobe to sell Lightroom and Photoshop as a perpetual license. If you’re one of those people, I had a frank discussion with folks feeling this way on this week’s episode of “The Grid.” You can watch it below (rather than leaving the same predictable comment as always). It starts at the 5:57 minute mark. If you’re into Travel Photography, there’s an online conference coming next month for you! Check out the official trailer below. It’s 2-days, 2-tracks, tons of great classes on everything from the photography to the post processing, and if you use On1’s plugins, you absolutely don’t want to miss this one (plus, you get the entire conference archieved to stream on-demand for an entire year). You can get your ticket (and save $100) right now at kelbyonelive.com Thanks, everybody.

    "description": "First, a big thanks to everybody who came by to see me at the BILD Conference, either on the main Photography stage or at Adobe’s booth theater (shown above – photo by Terry White). What an incredible event the folks at B\u0026H Photo pulled off – it was jam-packed the whole time, it was a huge show floor, lots of great sessions, and it was so great to see a big show in New York, like back in the pre-COVID days. Seriously, fantastic event from start to finish. My hats off to B\u0026H Photo for pulling off an event of this scale, and my thanks to them and Adobe for the honor of having me speak at the show. Can’t wait until the next one! My Favorite Underrated Feature One feature that kind of slipped by a lot of folks, because of all the big features (like people and reflection removal, and the super handy landscape masking features), is a big change to the AI noise reduction feature, called ‘Denoise.’ When you used this in the past, first you had to know where to find it (it was a bit buried), and then when you did use it it created a separate DNG file, so you had the original image, and then a duplicate that had Denoise applied, and it was just kind of a clunky workflow. Now, after the June update, Denoise is not only right there in the Detail panel (along with Super Resolution), but applying it no longer creates a separate DNG – it’s applied to your raw photo, but of course, it’s still 100% non-destructive and easily undoable. It’s a little thing, but it makes a big difference. Hope you all have a great Monday. 🙂 -Scott The post The Most Underrated Lightroom Classic Update From the June Adobe Update appeared first on Lightroom Killer Tips.",

    "link": "http://strobist.blogspot.com/2024/06/ive-been-working-on-something.html",
    "description": "Hey gang, it’s David. It’s been a while! In 2021, I archived Strobist as a completed project. I can’t honestly say that I’ve missed the breakneck pace of running a solo site. But I’ve definitely missed interacting with so many cool people all of the time. That said, I am still teaching. X-Peditions gives me the twin advantages much smaller class sizes, plus being in Hanoi every fall. And that’s been wonderful. Better yet, my new schedule has given me the breathing room to be able build my current project. Like Strobist, this project is designed for photographers. But unlike this website, it has nothing at all to do with flash. Today I’m introducing my new book, The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto. It aspires to be for traveling photographers what Strobist always tried to be for lighting photographers. The premise of the book is that your camera can, and should, be much more than just a pricey recording device when you travel. It can also serve as a passport, opening up new connections and possibilities that otherwise might not have happened. Using a photo trip to Southeast Asia as a framework, the book walks through many things that you can do to help this to happen. I have uploaded three documents to help you to know if TTPM might be suited for you: 1. A 5-minute summary: This will quickly give you a feel for the book. 2. A 27-page supplement: Only a small portion of the book, which is unillustrated, is about camera operation. This visual supplement is available for readers who are more visual learners. And it will give you a quick skim of parts 4 and 5. 3. A sample chapter: How to become more comfortable meeting and engaging with people as a photographer. As you'll see from the summary, most of the book is not about camera operation at all. It’s more about the countless little things that working photojournalists do while on assignment that an enthusiast might not think of. These little habits, taken together, can start to form the impression of a photographer being consistently, conspicuously lucky. When in reality, luck had very little to do with it. So, if this is the sort of thing that interests you, I hope you’ll give the book a spin. It is available now, on Amazon.com worldwide. Just as with Strobist, I welcome your feedback from this project as well. My email is listed on the copyright page and elsewhere. And of course, I will read and take to heart every Amazon review. Because my goal is for the project to continue to evolve and improve over time, just as the material on this website did. Thanks for your interest, and for your readership of Strobist. As always, please say hi at any time on Twitter at @Strobist. Cheers, David The Traveling Photographer’s Manifesto (Amazon.com)",

    "description": "In 2006 I started a lighting blog while working full-time as a staffer at The Baltimore Sun. By early 2007, it became obvious that I didn't have the personal resources to give 100% to both Strobist and my job at the newspaper. That’s exactly the position I find myself in today. For the past year I have been working on a new project. It is photography-based, and will be as unique to the photo space as Strobist was back in 2006. But, as I found with Strobist in 2007, this project will require all of my focus. So I am shifting Strobist into archive mode to allow myself the time and mental space to do that. If I had more available brain cells/hours in the day, I would be happy to do both. Alas, I do not. So I am choosing the one I think can make a bigger difference to photographers. When the new project launches, I’ll do my best to make sure you hear about it. So please, stay tuned! For those of you who are interested in our in-person lighting workshops and/or our X-Peditions trips (both of which are currently on pause during the pandemic) we absolutely are planning to restart them once the coast is clear. Please make sure you are on the relevant notification list(s) by clicking through to the links above. Finally, I want to take this moment to say thank you to the countless people I have met, and new friendships made, as a result of publishing Strobist over the past 15 years. It is impossible to express how much you all have enriched my life, and that of my family. Thank you so much, David",
