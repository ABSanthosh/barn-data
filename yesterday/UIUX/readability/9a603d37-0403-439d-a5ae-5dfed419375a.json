That said, it’s that time of the year again! What is Adobe MAX 2024? Adobe MAX is an annual creativity conference for creative professionals put on by Adobe Inc. It has been happening every year for over 20 years now and the event helps Adobe showcase its latest developments and inspire a legion of creatives around the world. Adobe has popular programs like Photoshop, Illustrator and more recently Adobe AI-Powered Tools like Adobe Express that often get a lot of attention during this event. Key Highlights Inspiring Keynotes \u0026 Product Announcements The main highlights of MAX are the inspiring keynotes that kick off each morning. This is where Adobe’s bosses take the stage to show off new features and software updates coming soon. They call these first looks “Sneaks” – it’s your sneak peek at top-secret projects! Hands-On Training But keynotes are just the start. MAX also has so many hands-on labs and training classes taught by experts. You can take classes on things like photo editing, digital art, audio production, and more. Some are a few hours long, while others are multi-day intensive courses. Exhibitions \u0026 Feedback And then there’s the huge exhibitor space, kind of like a creative park! Adobe sets up demos showcasing their latest tools. You can talk to Adobe employees and get guided tours. Lots of other companies also have booths set up to introduce their own creative products. What Else is There? Entertainment MAX is about much more than just product announcements and training though. A big part of the experience is the entertainment and overall vibe of the event. Adobe always lines up special musical guests, celebrities, entertainers, and more to perform on stage. Networking Opportunities There are also tons of networking opportunities during social hours, receptions, and after-parties. Adobe MAX is a great place to connect with other creatives from around the world who you may never get to meet otherwise. You can share projects you’re working on, get feedback and advice, and just have fun with people who are as passionate about creativity as you are, gaining creative inspiration from keynotes and sessions. Get ready to dive into an amazing experience, online or in-person, from October 14–16. Whether you’re an agency owner like me or a creative who’s just starting out, there’s something for everyone here. What Happened Last Year in 2023? Let’s take a look back at what happened at last year’s Adobe MAX in 2023. It was a total game-changer for creative pros! Adobe unveiled three new powerful AI models called Firefly that can generate amazing images, graphics, and designs on demand. Over 100 crazy cool AI features landed across programs like Photoshop and Premiere Pro too. One of the biggest hits was Adobe Express, the easy app for making social posts, graphics, and more. It has abilities like Image Generation where you just describe what you want and boom – it makes it for you! There was also Text to Template where you write out ideas and Express builds beautiful designs automatically. Another huge reveal was GenStudio, a complete workflow solution connecting all of Adobe’s major apps. Now creators can make AI-powered content super quickly, approve it through shared review links, get data insights, and more – everything in one smooth end-to-end process. David Wadhwani from Adobe couldn’t stop gushing about the warm welcome for Firefly so far. Billions of images created by it already! He emphasized how this AI tech boosts experimentation while still giving artists full control of their creative vision. Speaking of control, Adobe made a big deal about content transparency too. New Content Credentials act like nutrition labels revealing what was AI-generated in any piece of content. It’s all about building trust as this new AI era takes shape. On that note, see our list of the best AI tools and best AI tools for graphic design. There was just so much more at MAX 2023 – wild AI brushes and effects in Photoshop, automatic relight and background swap tools in Premiere Pro, and so on. Creators left feeling energized to take their skills to the next level and gain new skills. And that brings us to Adobe MAX 2024 in sunny Miami! This year is sure to pack even more mind-blowing innovation as AI continues transforming the creative world. You won’t want to miss seeing the future first-hand at this can’t-miss event! Why Miami Beach Convention Center for 2024? So why did Adobe pick Miami Beach vs LA to host MAX 2024? A few key reasons: First off, the location itself is a creative’s dream. Miami has an amazing art/design scene with vibrant colors and cultures around every corner. Plus the city has gorgeous beaches just steps from the convention center. Speaking of the venue, the massive Miami Beach Convention Center offers over 500,000 square feet of space. That’s more than enough room to fit everyone comfortably for those jam-packed keynotes and exhibits, creating a uniquely immersive experience for all attendees. Adobe Max 2024 is an Event You Won’t Want to Miss! For designers, filmmakers, photographers, and any other creative professionals, Adobe MAX, the creativity conference, is the ultimate place to get recharged and ready for what’s next. Getting hands-on experience with upcoming Adobe tools and connecting with creative geniuses from across the globe, it’s a truly special experience. This October in Miami Beach, Adobe MAX 2024 is setting the stage for an unforgettable creative festival. Inspiring demos, celeb-studded shows, endless networking, it’s all happening there. Save those dates and get ready to soak in tons of creative energy at this one-of-a-kind event! Adobe Max 2024 Sessions I’m Excited About! With the massive event just right around the corner, I’m excited to hear many of my contemporaries take center stage and share with the world what they’ve been putting out. On-demand sessions will also be available, allowing attendees to engage with pre-recorded presentations and discussions at their convenience. Here’s a quick rundown of select sessions—some of which are available only in-person—I’m particularly looking forward to. Aaron Draplin: Old Dog, New Tricks First up, we have the legendary Aaron Draplin in his session called ‘Old Dog, New Tricks.’ If you haven’t heard of him yet, where have you been? In my opinion, he’s a design powerhouse who’s had no problem whatsoever in staying relevant. Why would he when he’s quite literally one of the people that continuously shapes discussions in the world of design? In his session, he’s going to share his journey of self-discovery and creative breakthroughs, proving that even the most seasoned pros still learn new things along the way. Expect to walk away with valuable design tips, like how to use ‘subtraction’ to elevate your work and how to not lose your ‘edge’ in an industry that consistently demands cohesive themes and conformity. Also, I’m excited to see him talk about the many things he’s ideated and produced throughout his professional career. Harnessing the Power of Social Media’ session with James Barnard and Kristy Campbell Now, if social media is more your jam, then you’ll definitely want to check out the ‘Harnessing the Power of Social Media‘ session by James Barnard and Kristy Campbell who were speakers at our recent Brand Builders Summit.

Today’s digital landscape has made it ten times easier to build a clientele and work with like-minded creatives, and James and Kristy are the right people to show you how. You’ll come away with actionable insights on how to effectively leverage your social media to connect meaningfully with your audience. Unseen to Unforgettable: The Power of Personal Branding with Kristy Campbell Another session you won’t want to miss is ‘Unseen to Unforgettable: The Power of Personal Branding‘ still with Kristy Campbell.

Here, Kristy will share her wisdom on integrating your personal brand with your business to create a memorable and recognizable identity. So if evoking emotional resonance and crafting an identifiable legacy is something up your alley, make sure to check this out. She’ll cover everything from taking creative risks to developing your unique character. Building Brands: From Brand Strategy to Social Content with Rian Harmon And for those eager to dive into the world of branding, Rian Harmon’s session, ‘Building Brands: From Brand Strategy to Social Content,’ is a treasure trove of ideas and data. As the co-founder of the award-winning agency, Day Job, Rian has helped build successful brands like Recess and Fly by Jing. Here, he’ll walk you through the foundational principles of building a brand identity and making the most of social media for intentional engagement. If you’re looking to enhance your content creation process, he’ll talk about in-depth tips and tricks about Adobe Express. Creativity Super Session: Graphic Design Last but certainly not least, get ready for the Creativity Super Session: Graphic Design, featuring Adobe’s leading minds.

Mark your calendars for October 14-16 and get ready to unleash your creativity! My Adobe Live Session: The Logo Design Process (Step by Step) While you’re at it, be sure to tune in to my Adobe Live session, where I walk you through The Logo Design Process (Step by Step) using my San Francisco logo design as the case study. I cover everything from the strategic foundation and in-depth research to the creative design process and final implementation, showing you exactly how I craft iconic logos. Lastly, I’m thrilled to share that I was recently featured as an Adobe Live ‘Featured Artist’. You can check out the feature to see some of my design work in action! Adobe, AI, and The Future There’s never been a more vital time to tell stories and shape conversations until today. We live in a world where creatives have a much bigger say now. And artists of all kinds, copy-based or art, are now taking space and holding their own. I personally couldn’t be happier to have a reliable partner like Adobe in this journey. With AI technologies taking over, I’m confident that Adobe will continuously help creatives push the envelope and take part in better, more inclusive, and more meaningful explorations of design. After all, design should feel accessible — not intimidating and exclusive. From breaking down the components of branding to mastering social media strategies, this year’s Adobe Max, the creativity conference, has an incredible lineup of sessions designed to inspire and equip you to harness your imagination and efficiency like never before.
