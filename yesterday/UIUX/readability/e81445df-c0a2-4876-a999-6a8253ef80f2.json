It’s a scenario we’ve probably all experienced before, but have you ever stopped to think: What if every time your phone beeped, it was as loud and jarring as a car horn?The thought is unsettling, but this seems to be the reality for millions living in urban areas where car horns have become a constant source of noise pollution.I live in a decently population-dense city where rush hour traffic would start at 3 pm and my commute time would essentially double if not triple. I’ve noticed a peculiar trend where drivers seem to use their horns more frequently in moments of frustration or aggression, yet remain silent when safety truly demands it.Source: https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/local-news/vancouver-among-worst-cities-for-rush-hour-traffic-in-north-america-6596249What has happened to the car horn’s original purpose as a safety tool?Instead of alerting others to potential dangers, it’s often used as an outlet for anger or impatience, contributing to the urban noise pollution.I’ve observed this phenomenon over and over again, where drivers would honk in road rage incidents, while others fail to sound their horns when necessary, such as when pedestrians step into the road unexpectedly. This misuse signals the improper usage of car horns as safety devices, but also reflects how we communicate on the road.The original design and intentThe car horn was originally designed as a safety tool to alert pedestrians and other drivers of a vehicle’s presence. Its history dates back to the late 19th century when automobiles began sharing roads with pedestrians, horses, and cyclists.The need for an audible warning device was apparent as roads grew busier and accidents became more frequent.",
