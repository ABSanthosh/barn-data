This is an all too common reality in the world of design today — a consequence of cultural blind spots that leave certain voices unheard.In industries such as tech and design, those responsible for crafting these experiences often fail to reflect the diversity of the very individuals they are designing for.When cultural nuances are overlooked, the consequences range from mild frustration to significant exclusion.Consider design choices that fail to account for different languages, accessibility needs, or cultural preferences. These aren’t just oversights; they’re missed opportunities to create truly inclusive products that resonate deeply with all users.",
