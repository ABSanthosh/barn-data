However, asking the same question to creative folks will get you suggestions like bookmarks, stacking towers, a calendar, and party garlands.These answers help to illustrate how the humble deck of cards can achieve two important criteria of sustained usage:Reusability: the quality of being able to be used again repeatedlyVersatility: the quality of being adaptable in different functions or activitiesCards can be both reusable when they are used to play games and versatile for their multi-functionality.
