  "text": "How to guide organisations towards innovation with a more interconnected, dynamic approach to design.Systems thinking shifts our attention from single isolated components to interconnected wholes.Systems are everywhere, from websites and businesses to entire cities and economies. They consist of many interconnected parts working together to achieve a goal, like how immune cells team up to protect the body against infections.Viewing the world through a systems lens helps us look beyond isolated parts to see everything as a whole. This mindset shift is vital for innovating products, services, and any initiative to enhance a process, community or economy. Welcome to systems thinking.Thinking in SystemsSystems thinking is an approach explored by the late Donella H. Meadows in her book Thinking in Systems: A Primer. It teaches us to understand system parts, structure, and behaviour to design for a more sustainable and efficient world.“A system is a set of things — people, cells, molecules, or whatever — interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behaviour over time.” — Donella H. Meadows.",
