  "text": "A comprehensive explanation.Photo taken by author.Every day, I talk with people struggling to find a UX design, research, or content job.The UX job market has never been this difficult to navigate. Even seasoned, talented UX professionals are struggling to land their next job. Many report applying to hundreds of positions without getting invited to a single interview. For some, months of unemployment have pushed them to reconsider continuing their careers in UX.I regularly hear reports of dozens, sometimes hundreds, of people applying for positions, sometimes within the first 24 hours of posting. If you’re a UXer applying for work, it’s easy to become disheartened by the seeming fruitlessness of your efforts.The UX job market is a mess. Here’s a comprehensive guide to why and what you can do about it.It wasn’t always this way.Getting a UX job three years ago was much more straightforward. In fact, from the early 2000s until late 2022, landing one was much easier, as there was a heavy demand for people with UX skills.I have joked that, a few years ago, all a UX professional needed to do was sit in a darkened room and whisper, “I can do UX.” In an instant, a half-dozen recruiters would materialize and start bidding on who would get the UXer into the first interview. That doesn’t happen anymore.UX professionals became in high demand after the infamous Dot Com crash of 2000–2001. That global economic crash happened because companies jumped into emerging web technology too quickly without considering the need to make websites usable. Companies realized they needed their sites to be well-designed, pushing the newly formed UX field into a growth period.When the iPhone arrived in 2007 and apps emerged in 2009, the need for high-quality UX became even more prominent. The field expanded further with the growth of B2B, SaaS, and consumer applications like Netflix and Airbnb.When the pandemic hit in March of 2020, while other businesses were shutting down, tech companies shifted their focus to lockdown-related businesses, such as at-home delivery and supply chain management. These all required more UX support.Then, we saw the most significant hiring spike in UX history. The Biden Administration’s 2021 Inflation Reduction Act included special R\u0026D tax credits. Congress believed a massive investment in new technologies would boost the economy, so tech companies took advantage of those credits to hire speculatively.From the beginning of 2021 until late 2022, companies hired massive numbers of tech workers, including UX designers, researchers, and content professionals. Many were hired to work on speculative projects like the Metaverse, crypto, and consumer-grade self-driving cars. Venture capitalists and companies invested billions of dollars in these new technologies, and great UX was crucial.But it didn’t last. The growth in the UX market suddenly inverted. Whereas previously, there were far more open positions for UX professionals than there were people to fill them, things had changed. Now, there are far more unemployed UX professionals than open positions.And the question is why?What didn’t cause this job market mess?Suddenly, starting in late 2022, attaining UX jobs became much more difficult, but nobody seemed to know why.People posted on LinkedIn and other social networking sites that their companies were laying off their entire UX teams. Dozens, sometimes more than a hundred UX folks, were let go at once.Theories emerged. People started talking about how UX had lost the respect of executives, and that’s why companies were letting teams go. Some insinuated that corporate management thought they could replace UX professionals with inexpensive AI.The general belief was the UX industry was collapsing because it had suddenly become obsolete. We can now see, several years later, that none of this turned out to be true.There is no evidence that anything has triggered a loss of respect for UX. While UX leaders have always struggled to demonstrate UX’s full value, that did not change significantly from 2020 to 2023. Nor has there been a single documented instance of a UX person being replaced by an AI tool.Instead, as I write this during the first days of 2025, more UX professionals are employed globally than ever. Some estimates put the field currently at more than 2 million people. UX folks are employed by more organizations than ever, finding themselves in every industry, from environmental safety to sewage processing to government to shipping logistics.There are now more open UX positions than ever, and the field is growing at its highest rate.Yet, there are also more unemployed UX people than ever. And that’s the problem.If this current hiring mess wasn’t caused by AI or a massive, sudden devaluation of UX, what was the cause?Five things that changed to cause this mess …It turns out that there wasn’t one cause. Instead, five things changed simultaneously.Change 1: The tax credit expired.In the U.S., the Republican-led Congress chose not to renew the portions of the Inflation Reduction Act that gave companies hiring and retention incentives. As a result, employees suddenly became more expensive, and tech companies started seeking ways to cut costs.This change pushed tech companies into significant layoffs. They cited the substantial unrealized expenses in those speculative projects (we never did get our Metaverse, did we?) and cut their losses.There’s a myth that companies targeted UX people more in layoffs than engineering or product people. However, there’s no evidence to support this.When Meta laid off 21,000 people in 2022 and 2023, a few hundred were UX people. That might have been the largest layoff for UX people, but the discipline was not a special target. All the other layoffs were similar. UX people were never more than a small proportion of the total people let go.Change 2: Interest rates increased due to inflation.Since Congress did not cooperate to keep inflation down, the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank started raising interest rates. In April 2020 (right after the pandemic began), the Federal Reserve interest rate was at 0.05%. However, at the peak of inflation in June 2022, the Fed had raised the rate to 1.21%.As interest rates rose, investors feared their corporate investments were no longer good deals and demanded that companies pay them back. This demand resulted in massive market stock buybacks, which allowed investors to withdraw their money. The buybacks forced companies to cut costs even further, which resulted in laying off more workers of all kinds, including UX workers.Change 3: Bootcamp programs flooded the market with inexperienced UX professionals.Meanwhile, the speculative hiring period from 2021 to 2022 encouraged people to switch to tech fields, including UX. Low-cost boot camp programs took advantage of the demand and started a factory approach to producing graduates.Thousands of newly minted UX professionals with zero years of work experience were now competing against the recently laid-off experienced UXers for the limited number of available positions.Change 4: Automated hiring systems reduced application friction.Advances in online job sites and application tracking systems made it much easier to apply for jobs. Before these advances, Human Resources employees had to process every application. Online software now processes millions of applications with little human intervention.Because of this change, applying became as simple as uploading a résumé document and answering a few questions. Job seekers could apply to dozens of jobs each day.Nothing in these new application tracking systems ensured only qualified candidates applied for the listed positions. Suddenly, people applied to any available position, regardless of their qualifications. The systems were flooded with unqualified candidates, and positions received hundreds of applications immediately upon opening.This change slowed the hiring process tremendously and made it more difficult for hiring managers to focus on genuinely qualified candidates.Change 5: Companies offered remote positions.Because of the pandemic, working from home was now possible, independent of the company’s location. Before the pandemic, your job required you to work at an office that was an (almost) reasonable commute distance from your home. When companies started offering remote positions, you could work anywhere.This shift to remote work removed the geographic restrictions on job applications, giving applicants many more viable positions to apply to. The result was a dramatic increase in applications for every open position.… And two things that should’ve changed but didn’t.There are a couple of things that, had they changed leading up to 2022, this inversion would’ve dampened if not been outright prevented.Non-change 1: UX should have gone strategic.Since its popularity in the 2000s, UX has been 100% tactical in most organizations. UX teams have devoted the bulk of their work to designing and validating specific designs. Companies started hiring Product Designers instead of UX Designers or Information Architects to create a one-size-fits-all position that works hard to deliver the least terrible products as quickly as possible.UX should have grown into more strategic roles as the field expanded and matured, but that didn’t happen. Instead, UX teams remained tactical, emphasizing design aesthetics and cleaning up poor UX.This pervasive tactical approach became the de facto model of UX, with no real discussion among UX leaders about how to do anything differently. Thus, product managers and senior stakeholders had no alternative models with which to work.Organization management saw UX as an adjunct practice to support product and development efforts. The question became, “How few UX folks can we get away with while keeping our development and delivery efforts moving forward?” This mindset limited the value of adding more UX people to teams.Non-change 2: UX management didn’t create senior opportunities.Without a strategic career path, senior UX professionals were left to hone their skills instead of learning new ones. Eventually, they became better at their practice than their companies demanded.Being at the top of your career path can become repetitive for many folks. They don’t feel challenged in their work, which leads to frustration and a feeling that they can’t grow without moving into a different profession, such as UX management or product management.It also limits the possibility of promotion and salary increases. Some UX folks tried changing jobs, but they quickly hit the ceiling in their new positions.Simultaneously, having the most senior people stuck at the top of the career ladder limited promotion for more junior positions. And without the current junior UXers moving up the ladder, early-career folks had limited opportunities to get their first jobs.This lack of a career ladder created a hiring traffic jam, which increased the number of early-career UXers in the market. They looked for any opening that would take them, and they started applying to the open positions they could find, even when those early-career folks could see they didn’t have enough experience for those positions. The result was hundreds of people applying to practically every open position.How long will this UX job market mess continue?When will it go back to the way it was? Not for a long time. If ever. It took 20 years to reach this inversion, and it could take a decade or more for the market to reverse again.Another inversion would require many more open positions than available UX people to fill them. That might happen if some market changes trigger a massive increase in demand for UX people.There is precedent for this. After the 2001 Dot Com Crash, the companies that took their time to move into websites had just watched the first wave peak and then crash and burn. (We miss you, Pets.com sock puppet.)Those companies could see that the web offered some value, but it was clear that success would require a thoughtful approach. Out of this clarity emerged our first massive demand for UX.The same phenomenon repeated in the early 2010s with the success of app stores and SaaS products. Investors and founders saw their chances of success increase significantly when they built strong UX efforts. (In that era, demand grew so much that banks, big-bucks consultancies, and other old-school institutions acquired entire design firms to have an already up-and-functioning team.)However, whatever massive growth trigger there may be, it won’t arrive for years. Until then, this is the market we’ll have to live with.Navigating the new normal.Successfully navigating this new post-inversion UX job market requires different job-seeking skills and practices than what worked before the inversion. This change is throwing many UX practitioners off their game, as what previously worked for them is no longer working.In the pre-inversion days, hiring managers faced more challenges because fewer qualified candidates were available. Even if a candidate didn’t 100% match the manager’s needs, they would still consider them.Waiting for a 100%-qualified candidate could delay filling the position for weeks or months, so hiring managers would compromise with candidates who weren’t perfect matches. It was common for candidates to accept another company’s offer because the hiring manager took too long to complete the interview process and make an offer. Even then, many candidates had multiple offers to choose from, requiring the “losing” companies to start the hiring process over with other candidates.In the current market, hiring managers have the luxury of passing up a close match to see if they can find someone perfectly qualified. With hundreds of applications for each open position, there’s a good chance that a better match is waiting in the same pile.This new hiring climate requires significant adjustments to how candidates present themselves and how hiring managers evaluate their candidates.What you must do if you’re looking for your next job.If you’re currently looking for your next job, there are a few things you can do to make the process easier.Don’t take this personally. Even if you were let go without warning. It is not about you or your abilities.Think of the job search as a months-long project. While there are actions you can take that will reduce the length of your search, it will likely still take months. (Not like the short timeframes of the pre-inversion times.)Don’t apply to jobs for which you’re not highly qualified. The “spray-and-pray” approach of applying to every possible job doesn’t work. Neither does applying to jobs you’re overqualified for. These things don’t increase your chances. They just clog up the hiring pipelines for everyone else.Work your existing network. Reach out to people who know you and your work already and ask them how they’re doing. When they reply, you can say you’re in between positions and excited for your next opportunity. Your friends will automatically tell you about any positions they’re aware of, so you don’t need to ask.Don’t search alone. To fight the loneliness and potential depression of a long job search, build a community of folks who are also looking so you can talk to others who “get it.” Current job seekers tell me great things about participating in the activities of ADPList and Phyl Terry’s Never Search Alone project.Tailor your résumé, portfolio, and cover letter to the specifics in the job ad. You must demonstrate that you’re 100% qualified for the position. Everything in your application submission must prove that you can do this job because you’ve already done it elsewhere. Everything you’ve done that isn’t proof you can do this job becomes noise to the hiring manager, so leave it out. Only focus on what matches the hiring manager’s needs.Finally, take care of yourself. Seriously, this is the most important thing. Pay attention to your own needs, stay hydrated, and take long walks. Permit yourself to tackle your job search like any critical project. Give yourself room to do your best job finding.What you must do if you might enter the job market soon.You may be gainfully employed today, but what if that changes? Many folks were surprised when their organizations unexpectedly decided to cut expenses. These folks weren’t ready to suddenly enter the job market. Being prepared is the key.You might also be among the UX professionals ready to move on, but today’s messy job market is foreboding. There are things you can do before you jump in.Build up your Career Management Document. Make sure you regularly collect the artifacts and journey of your work experience. A rich CMD makes responding to positions with tailored materials much more manageable, which means you can respond to positions early.Start reaching out to your existing network now. Don’t wait until you’re out of work to contact folks. Connect with people in your network immediately, then keep in touch every few months. That way, it won’t seem like you only reach out when you need job leads (which you should never do — just ask how they’re doing).Build up a bigger network. Track who gets to know you and the quality of your work. Connect with these folks on LinkedIn or add their non-work email addresses to your contacts. Find common interests outside of work, so you have things to continue talking with them about. Networking is all about building rich, lifelong relationships. (Think of it like planting a new apple tree. It takes years for the tree to produce fruit, so you must put it in the ground as soon as possible.)Constantly survey the market. In the olden days, UX folks had recruiters regularly banging on their doors and updating them on what hiring managers were seeking. Post-inversion, reading job ads is the best way to learn what the market wants. You don’t have to apply, but knowing what the market is seeking can give you insight into how to plan your career going forward.Be a lifelong learner. Dedicate time and effort to learn new things (and document what you’re learning in your CMD). The more knowledge you gain, the more expertise you can communicate with hiring managers. Too many UX professionals let themselves stop learning, just repeating identical work assignments in every project. They end up without a good story to tell their next employer about their continual desire to grow.What can you do if you’re hiring new UXers for your team?As a UX team manager, you can make the hiring process smoother.Far too many job ads are vague and only describe the attributes that would qualify anyone who is a competent UX professional. (Real bullets from recent job ads: “Must be able to communicate with team members” or “Leverage usability insights to guide your involvement across a broad solution space.”)When your job ads are too vague, they signal you (or, at least, your HR department) don’t know what you want from your next new hire. It turns away many of your most qualified candidates, leaving you with many less-qualified applicants. Vagueness makes it hard for highly qualified candidates to get you the evidence they are a close fit for the position.I recommend hiring managers write a First Anniversary Thank You Note to their unknown new hire. The note should describe the accomplishments you want your new UXer to achieve in their first year.When you publish the position’s job ad, the more you can post about the details of that note, the better your applicant quality will get. You’ll give potential candidates insights into the comparable experience you’ll use to assess their fitness for the job.You’ll get better quality applications, which will get you to an offer sooner.The mess is here to stay (for a while, at least).It’s important to realize that the job market has changed significantly and will not change back for a while. It’s navigable, but the most successful approaches vastly differ from those before the inversion.Those who adapt have a much higher chance of nailing their next opportunity faster. UXers who keep trying outdated approaches will likely only experience frustration without getting their desired outcome: landing a great job.This article was originally published on CenterCentre.com.We have many UX job search resources available in our 52,000 member UX Leader community, Leaders of Awesomeness.

Low-cost boot camp programs took advantage of the demand and started a factory approach to producing graduates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"90bc\"\u003eThousands of newly minted UX professionals with zero years of work experience were now competing against the recently laid-off experienced UXers for the limited number of available positions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"5105\"\u003eChange 4: Automated hiring systems reduced application friction.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp id=\"321e\"\u003eAdvances in online job sites and application tracking systems made it much easier to apply for jobs. Before these advances, Human Resources employees had to process every application. Online software now processes millions of applications with little human intervention.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"b779\"\u003eBecause of this change, applying became as simple as uploading a résumé document and answering a few questions. Job seekers could apply to dozens of jobs each day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"c2c5\"\u003eNothing in these new application tracking systems ensured only qualified candidates applied for the listed positions. Suddenly, people applied to any available position, regardless of their qualifications. The systems were flooded with unqualified candidates, and positions received hundreds of applications immediately upon opening.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"9086\"\u003eThis change slowed the hiring process tremendously and made it more difficult for hiring managers to focus on genuinely qualified candidates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"03d4\"\u003eChange 5: Companies offered remote positions.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp id=\"8c21\"\u003eBecause of the pandemic, working from home was now possible, independent of the company’s location. Before the pandemic, your job required you to work at an office that was an (almost) reasonable commute distance from your home. When companies started offering remote positions, you could work anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"fa58\"\u003eThis shift to remote work removed the geographic restrictions on job applications, giving applicants many more viable positions to apply to. The result was a dramatic increase in applications for every open position.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"5c9f\"\u003e… And two things that should’ve changed but didn’t.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp id=\"d2de\"\u003eThere are a couple of things that, had they changed leading up to 2022, this inversion would’ve dampened if not been outright prevented.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"8a01\"\u003eNon-change 1: UX should have gone strategic.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp id=\"6727\"\u003eSince its popularity in the 2000s, UX has been 100% tactical in most organizations. UX teams have devoted the bulk of their work to designing and validating specific designs. Companies started hiring \u003cem\u003eProduct Designers\u003c/em\u003e instead of \u003cem\u003eUX Designers\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eInformation Architects\u003c/em\u003e to create a one-size-fits-all position that works hard to deliver the least terrible products as quickly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"051a\"\u003eUX should have grown into more strategic roles as the field expanded and matured, but that didn’t happen. Instead, UX teams remained tactical, emphasizing design aesthetics and cleaning up poor UX.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"c97b\"\u003eThis pervasive tactical approach became the de facto model of UX, with no real discussion among UX leaders about how to do anything differently. Thus, product managers and senior stakeholders had no alternative models with which to work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"e0d7\"\u003eOrganization management saw UX as an adjunct practice to support product and development efforts. The question became, “How few UX folks can we get away with while keeping our development and delivery efforts moving forward?” This mindset limited the value of adding more UX people to teams.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"6e22\"\u003eNon-change 2: UX management didn’t create senior opportunities.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp id=\"f0cb\"\u003eWithout a strategic career path, senior UX professionals were left to hone their skills instead of learning new ones. Eventually, they became better at their practice than their companies demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"ee46\"\u003eBeing at the top of your career path can become repetitive for many folks. They don’t feel challenged in their work, which leads to frustration and a feeling that they can’t grow without moving into a different profession, such as UX management or product management.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"7034\"\u003eIt also limits the possibility of promotion and salary increases. Some UX folks tried changing jobs, but they quickly hit the ceiling in their new positions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"55b0\"\u003eSimultaneously, having the most senior people stuck at the top of the career ladder limited promotion for more junior positions. And without the current junior UXers moving up the ladder, early-career folks had limited opportunities to get their first jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"1522\"\u003eThis lack of a career ladder created a hiring traffic jam, which increased the number of early-career UXers in the market. They looked for any opening that would take them, and they started applying to the open positions they could find, even when those early-career folks could see they didn’t have enough experience for those positions. The result was hundreds of people applying to practically every open position.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"04f3\"\u003eHow long will this UX job market mess continue?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp id=\"c257\"\u003eWhen will it go back to the way it was? Not for a long time. If ever. It took 20 years to reach this inversion, and it could take a decade or more for the market to reverse again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"629e\"\u003eAnother inversion would require many more open positions than available UX people to fill them. That might happen if some market changes trigger a massive increase in demand for UX people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"9791\"\u003eThere is precedent for this. After the 2001 Dot Com Crash, the companies that took their time to move into websites had just watched the first wave peak and then crash and burn. (We miss you, Pets.com sock puppet.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"e98f\"\u003eThose companies could see that the web offered some value, but it was clear that success would require a thoughtful approach. Out of this clarity emerged our first massive demand for UX.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"51a0\"\u003eThe same phenomenon repeated in the early 2010s with the success of app stores and SaaS products. Investors and founders saw their chances of success increase significantly when they built strong UX efforts. (In that era, demand grew so much that banks, big-bucks consultancies, and other old-school institutions acquired entire design firms to have an already up-and-functioning team.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"0999\"\u003eHowever, whatever massive growth trigger there may be, it won’t arrive for years. Until then, this is the market we’ll have to live with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"ceff\"\u003eNavigating the new normal.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp id=\"457b\"\u003eSuccessfully navigating this new post-inversion UX job market requires different job-seeking skills and practices than what worked before the inversion. This change is throwing many UX practitioners off their game, as what previously worked for them is no longer working.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"4d21\"\u003eIn the pre-inversion days, hiring managers faced more challenges because fewer qualified candidates were available. Even if a candidate didn’t 100% match the manager’s needs, they would still consider them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"8376\"\u003eWaiting for a 100%-qualified candidate could delay filling the position for weeks or months, so hiring managers would compromise with candidates who weren’t perfect matches. It was common for candidates to accept another company’s offer because the hiring manager took too long to complete the interview process and make an offer. Even then, many candidates had multiple offers to choose from, requiring the “losing” companies to start the hiring process over with other candidates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"4bb9\"\u003eIn the current market, hiring managers have the luxury of passing up a close match to see if they can find someone perfectly qualified. With hundreds of applications for each open position, there’s a good chance that a better match is waiting in the same pile.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"2e31\"\u003eThis new hiring climate requires significant adjustments to how candidates present themselves and how hiring managers evaluate their candidates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"44a7\"\u003eWhat you must do if you’re looking for your next job.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp id=\"5132\"\u003eIf you’re currently looking for your next job, there are a few things you can do to make the process easier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"fdbd\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eDon’t take this personally.\u003c/em\u003e Even if you were let go without warning. It is not about you or your abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"4c8a\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThink of the job search as a months-long project.\u003c/em\u003e While there are actions you can take that will reduce the length of your search, it will likely still take months. (Not like the short timeframes of the pre-inversion times.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"a901\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eDon’t apply to jobs for which you’re not highly qualified.\u003c/em\u003e The “spray-and-pray” approach of applying to every possible job doesn’t work. Neither does applying to jobs you’re overqualified for. These things don’t increase your chances. They just clog up the hiring pipelines for everyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"d7cd\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWork your existing network.\u003c/em\u003e Reach out to people who know you and your work already and ask them how they’re doing. When they reply, you can say you’re in between positions and excited for your next opportunity. Your friends will automatically tell you about any positions they’re aware of, so you don’t need to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"dd7f\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eDon’t search alone.\u003c/em\u003e To fight the loneliness and potential depression of a long job search, build a community of folks who are also looking so you can talk to others who “get it.” Current job seekers tell me great things about participating in the activities of \u003ca href=\"http://adplist.org\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eADPList\u003c/a\u003e and Phyl Terry’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.phyl.org/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNever Search Alone\u003c/a\u003e project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"f9e3\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eTailor your résumé, portfolio, and cover letter to the specifics in the job ad.\u003c/em\u003e You must demonstrate that you’re 100% qualified for the position. Everything in your application submission must prove that you can do this job because you’ve already done it elsewhere. Everything you’ve done that isn’t proof you can do this job becomes noise to the hiring manager, so leave it out. Only focus on what matches the hiring manager’s needs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"ca1e\"\u003eFinally, \u003cem\u003etake care of yourself.\u003c/em\u003e Seriously, this is the most important thing. Pay attention to your own needs, stay hydrated, and take long walks. Permit yourself to tackle your job search like any critical project. Give yourself room to do your best job finding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"b1bc\"\u003eWhat you must do if you might enter the job market soon.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp id=\"8925\"\u003eYou may be gainfully employed today, but what if that changes? Many folks were surprised when their organizations unexpectedly decided to cut expenses. These folks weren’t ready to suddenly enter the job market. Being prepared is the key.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"16ce\"\u003eYou might also be among the UX professionals ready to move on, but today’s messy job market is foreboding. There are things you can do before you jump in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"c995\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBuild up your \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/the-career-management-document/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCareer Management Document\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e Make sure you regularly collect the artifacts and journey of your work experience. A rich CMD makes responding to positions with tailored materials much more manageable, which means you can respond to positions early.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"7de2\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eStart reaching out to your existing network now.\u003c/em\u003e Don’t wait until you’re out of work to contact folks. Connect with people in your network immediately, then keep in touch every few months. That way, it won’t seem like you only reach out when you need job leads (which you should never do — just ask how they’re doing).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"2233\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBuild up a bigger network.\u003c/em\u003e Track who gets to know you and the quality of your work. Connect with these folks on LinkedIn or add their non-work email addresses to your contacts. Find common interests outside of work, so you have things to continue talking with them about. Networking is all about building rich, lifelong relationships. (Think of it like planting a new apple tree. It takes years for the tree to produce fruit, so you must put it in the ground as soon as possible.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"be67\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eConstantly survey the market. \u003c/em\u003eIn the olden days, UX folks had recruiters regularly banging on their doors and updating them on what hiring managers were seeking. Post-inversion, reading job ads is the best way to learn what the market wants. You don’t have to apply, but knowing what the market is seeking can give you insight into how to plan your career going forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"aac7\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBe a lifelong learner.\u003c/em\u003e Dedicate time and effort to learn new things (and document what you’re learning in your CMD). The more knowledge you gain, the more expertise you can communicate with hiring managers. Too many UX professionals let themselves stop learning, just repeating identical work assignments in every project. They end up without a good story to tell their next employer about their continual desire to grow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"c561\"\u003eWhat can you do if you’re hiring new UXers for your team?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp id=\"80e7\"\u003eAs a UX team manager, you can make the hiring process smoother.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"b836\"\u003eFar too many job ads are vague and only describe the attributes that would qualify anyone who is a competent UX professional. (Real bullets from recent job ads: “Must be able to communicate with team members” or “Leverage usability insights to guide your involvement across a broad solution space.”)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"b79d\"\u003eWhen your job ads are too vague, they signal you (or, at least, your HR department) don’t know what you want from your next new hire. It turns away many of your most qualified candidates, leaving you with many less-qualified applicants. Vagueness makes it hard for highly qualified candidates to get you the evidence they are a close fit for the position.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"32f3\"\u003eI recommend hiring managers write a \u003ca href=\"https://articles.centercentre.com/the-thank-you-note-a-sketching-tool-for-ux-hiring/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eFirst Anniversary Thank You Note\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e to their unknown new hire.
