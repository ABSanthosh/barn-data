So, how can we create more inclusive experiences that work better for everyone?Neurodivergent needs are often considered as an edge case that doesn‚Äôt fit into common user journeys or flows. Neurodiversity tends to get overlooked in the design process. Or it is tackled late in the process, and only if there is enough time.But people aren‚Äôt edge cases. Every person is just a different person, performing tasks and navigating the web in a different way. So how can we design better, more inclusive experiences that cater to different needs and, ultimately, benefit everyone? Let‚Äôs take a closer look.By considering neurodiversity early in the design process, we can create better experiences for everyone. (Image source: Neurodiversity Design System) (Large preview)Neurodiversity Or Neurodivergent?There is quite a bit of confusion about both terms on the web. Different people think and experience the world differently, and neurodiversity sees differences as natural variations, not deficits. It distinguishes between neurotypical and neurodivergent people.Neurotypical people see the world in a ‚Äútypical‚Äù and widely perceived as expected way.Neurodivergent people experience the world differently, for example, people with ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, synesthesia, and hyperlexia.According to various sources, around 15‚Äì40% of the population has neurodivergent traits. These traits can be innate (e.g., autism) or acquired (e.g., trauma). But they are always on a spectrum, and vary a lot. A person with autism is not neurodiverse ‚Äî they are neurodivergent.One of the main strengths of neurodivergent people is how imaginative and creative they are, coming up with out-of-the-box ideas quickly. With exceptional levels of attention, strong long-term memory, a unique perspective, unbeatable accuracy, and a strong sense of justice and fairness.Being different in a world that, to some degree, still doesn‚Äôt accept these differences is exhausting. So unsurprisingly, neurodivergent people often bring along determination, resilience, and high levels of empathy.Design With People, Not For ThemAs a designer, I often see myself as a path-maker. I‚Äôm designing reliable paths for people to navigate to their goals comfortably. Without being blocked. Or confused. Or locked out.That means respecting the simple fact that people‚Äôs needs, tasks, and user journeys are all different, and that they evolve over time. And: most importantly, it means considering them very early in the process.Better accessibility is better for everyone. Instead of making decisions that need to be reverted or refined to be compliant, we can bring a diverse group of people ‚Äî with accessibility needs, with neurodiversity, frequent and infrequent users, experts, newcomers ‚Äî in the process, and design with them, rather than for them.Neurodiversity \u0026 Inclusive Design ResourcesA wonderful resource that helps us design for cognitive accessibility is St√©phanie Walter‚Äôs Neurodiversity and UX toolkit. It includes practical guidelines, tools, and resources to better understand and design for dyslexia, dyscalculia, autism, and ADHD.GOV.UK‚Äôs posters with accessibility dos and don‚Äôts are just one of the many useful resources you‚Äôll find in St√©phanie Walter‚Äôs collection. (Large preview)Another fantastic resource is Will Soward‚Äôs Neurodiversity Design System. It combines neurodiversity and user experience design into a set of design standards and principles that you can use to design accessible learning interfaces.Last but not least, I‚Äôve been putting together a few summaries about neurodiversity and inclusive design over the last few years, so you might find them helpful, too:ADHDAutismChildrenColorblindnessDeafnessDyscalculiaDyslexiaLegibilityLeft-Handed UsersMental HealthMotivationOlder AdultsScreen ReadersTeenagersA huge thank-you to everyone who has been writing, speaking, and sharing articles, resources, and toolkits on designing for diversity.
