  "text": "AI replacement and people displacementWhat NAFTA can teach us about AI and power inequalityIn a recent innovation conference, Gary Vaynerchuk, one of the keynote speakers, addressed AI as a tsunami heading our way.“Technology is like a humongous wave. … 98% of this room is gonna put their head in the sand on AI and the wave is gonna crush them.” — Gary Vaynerchuk. Link to a similar speechConferences are often marred by predictions that never materialize, but what really stuck with me is the fear in the eyes of some audience members.Those glances with a hint of terror seemed familiar. Like a long-forgotten memory of a tsunami I witnessed many years ago.Fear is impossible to wipe clean.In 1994, I was a teenager with a teenager's brain, feeling forced by my parents to spend my Saturday mornings at an English academy.Secretly, my rebellion was never about giving me opportunity to learn the language of MTV; it was about spending part of my weekend trying to speak English with a group of older male professionals, when I could have invested that time in a newly discovered imperative: Trying to talk to Spanish with girls my age (something I never mastered in either language).",
