  "text": "Algorithmic angst \u0026 the death of humanityEwan McGregor as Mark Renton from Trainspotting (Dir. by Danny Boyle, Miramax)Choose AI.Choose automation. Choose a fucking big neural network, algorithms, pipelines, machine learning models, and electrical tin openers that predict your every move. Choose high-speed internet, low-human effort, and zero accountability.Choose a chatbot that never shuts up.Choose synthetic voices and matching fake emotions. Choose research done by AI because talking to people takes too long.Choose infinite A/B tests with no real insights. Choose predictive analytics and wondering who the fuck you really are when the machine knows you better than you know yourself.Choose dark patterns, endless cookie banners, and onboarding flows stuffed with tooltips no one fucking reads.Choose fixed subscription plans and endless notifications.Choose a design system built by a model and a future with no fucking designers.Choose sitting on that couch scrolling mind-numbing spirit-crushing bullshit created by an algorithm.Choose stuffing fucking clickbait into your brain until you can’t think straight. Choose deepfakes, spam filters, and AI-generated influencers to replace yourself. Choose rotting away in virtual reality, pissing away your last shred of free will, nothing more than an optimized data point feeding the system. Choose your future.Choose AI.But why would I want to do a thing like that? I chose not to choose AI. I chose somethin’ else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who needs reasons when you’ve got a fucking big dataset?",
