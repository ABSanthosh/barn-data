  "text": "On Apple’s calculator appsThe sliding scale between skeuomorphic design and abstractionLike many designers before me, I have developed an obsession with the calculator designed by Steve Jobs for the 1984 Macintosh.The apocryphal story goes that Chris Espinosa (who apparently started working for Apple at the ripe old age of 14) got a brainwave on how to use the Macintosh’s showcase Quickdraw program. He wanted to come up with “desk ornaments”. Especially, a calculator. He struggled, however, to get final sign off from Jobs on a design version.This is a familiar story that many who worked under Jobs have told. Hundreds and hundreds of iterations with Jobs tearing them apart but offering no clue about what he actually wanted. Espinosa thought he finally had it. Instead, Jobs said:“Well, it’s a start but basically, it stinks. The background color is too dark, some lines are the wrong thickness, and the buttons are too big.”Color contrast, line thickness and proportionsThis Jobs quote now is seared in my mind as a succinct summary of the elements of effective UI design. Getting these elements to work together in balance is the name of the game.",
