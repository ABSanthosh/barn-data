Which of the following types of images need ALT text? All images Decorative stock photos Icons accompanied by a descriptive label Images that include task-related information What are the 3 components of the rhetorical triangle? Argument, Evidence, Conclusion Logos, Pathos, Ethos Speaker, Audience, Message Introduction, Body, Conclusion Which of the following is NOT a best practice for participant screeners for UX studies: Ask about participants’ past behavior. Rely on YES/NO questions. Include a few open-ended questions. Pilot the screener. What is the primary purpose of journey-centric design? To create aesthetically pleasing products To optimize individual interactions within the product To design for the user's entire lifetime experience with a product To minimize production costs Which of the following scenarios exemplifies the sneak-into–basket deceptive pattern? A website automatically adds service fees at the final stage of the purchase, without declaring them upfront. A service automatically adds a warranty plan to the user's cart during checkout without their knowledge. A subscription service commits the customer to regular payments unless they explicitly cancel their one-month free plan.  A registration form automatically commits the customer to marketing emails when they agree to create an account. The term “sparkle ambiguity” refers to: The fact that the sparkle icon has an ambiguous meaning for users — while they agree it represents something special, they do not know what Microinteractions or small animations that are designed to delight users, but end up causing distraction or uncertainty The trend of incorporating modern, flashy UI elements that may not necessarily fit the context or purpose of the application The challenge of designing interfaces that are both attractive and clear, where the visual appeal does not lead to confusion about the interface's functionality Which of the following is an appropriate outcome metric for an A/B test? User satisfaction from a survey Preference for a background color Number of usability issues encountered by a user Click-through rate on a call-to-action button Which AI-chatbot behavior does sycophancy refer to? The AI model uses language that is subservient and flattering to the user who prompted it. The AI model adapts responses to align with the user’s view, even if the view is not objectively true. The AI model persistently avoids any mention or criticism of its creators in its responses. The AI model persistently praises humans in its responses. What does directness measure in a tree test? The proportion of participants who found the correct answer The proportion of participants who backtracked or changed categories for a particular task The proportion of participants who went to the right answer without backtracking or changing categories The proportion of participants who correctly selected the first category on the path to the answer Which of the following is an example of an attitudinal research method: Eyetracking Preference testing for a visual design A/B testing Usability testing   What Was Your Score? 10: You’re a UX expert!
