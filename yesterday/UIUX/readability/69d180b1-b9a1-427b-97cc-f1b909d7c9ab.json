I recently switched from Windows to Mac, and the first thing I noticed was how typing just feels smoother like the text flows better, looks softer, and is easier on the eyes. At first glance, macOS text tends to appear more faithful to the font’s design, while Windows text looks crisper and more sharply defined.

Broadly speaking, Apple prioritizes aesthetic fidelity i.e. rendering fonts true to their design, as if they were printed on paper whereas Microsoft prioritizes on-screen readability and sharpness, even if it means deviating from the font’s pure design. In other words, Apple’s approach preserves the shape and weight of the typeface, while Microsoft’s approach “hammers” outlines to the pixel grid for crispness.
