From the initial boasts of technologists, PR bluster and social media half-facts, a more mature discovery of practical, real world utility and use-case scenarios are emerging.Can Generative AI help speed up learning how to code?For example, currently, I am teaching myself Python via a Harvard course (available for free on EdX). The terms of participating in the course, for those interested in earning a certificate, include an ethics code that prohibits the use of AI in assignments. However, my learning outcomes are more flexible and experimental.
