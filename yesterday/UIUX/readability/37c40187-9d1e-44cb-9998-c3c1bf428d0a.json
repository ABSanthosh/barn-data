  "text": "… or do you think you’re already a master at gathering product insights from your users?Photo by Towfiqu barbhuiya on UnsplashLet’s cut to the chase. You’re confused why 1) customers aren’t signing up in droves to use your product, and 2) for those that do, they churn before very long.And you’re especially confused because whenever you talk to someone about your ideas, people say they love ‘em.My guess is you’re not having very valuable conversations with these folks.Part of the issue may be that you’re talking more than listening.Another part may be that you’re hearing more than listening.And the final part may be that the questions you ask are just plain useless for getting you the insights you’re looking for. [No link this time — that’s this article!]Your product can only be as good as the insights you attain from your customers. Yet, you’re walking into user interviews armed with nothing but the hope that you’ll stumble upon some game-changing revelation.The sad part is that you know quite well that it takes more work than that.Maybe you just don’t know how to step up your game. Or maybe you just need a little push.",
