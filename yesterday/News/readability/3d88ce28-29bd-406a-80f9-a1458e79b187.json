  "text": "US vice president Kamala Harris In a bid to strengthen her appeal among Black men in the upcoming November election, US vice president Kamala Harris announced an extensive set of economic policies on Monday. This initiative, called the \"Opportunity Agenda for Black men,\" aims to solidify a crucial voting bloc aheadof the presidential election, where recent polls show a decline in support for Democrats, according to USA Today.Forgivable loansHarris' proposals include offering one million \"fully forgivable\" loans to Black business owners, designed to help those who lack the necessary resources and connections to launch their enterprises. The loans, which can reach up to $20,000, will be administered through a new partnership with the Small Business Administration.Marijuana legalisationAdditionally, Harris called for national legalisation of marijuana for recreational use, aiming to ensure that Black entrepreneurs gain access to the cannabis industry. Her campaign said, \"Kamala Harris will fight to ensure, as the national cannabis industry takes shape, Black men – who have, for years, been over-policed for marijuana use – are able to access wealth and jobs in this new market.\" This move is very different from how the previous administration handled things. President Joe Biden's team has recently worked to change marijuana's classification from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug.Addressing voter concernsThe unveiling of these policies comes as the Harris campaign faces pressure from within, particularly as former President Donald Trump gains traction among Black male voters. Recent polls indicate that Harris leads Trump by a margin of 78%-15% among Black voters, a significant drop from the 90% support Biden received in 2020.Harris will discuss her economic agenda at a Black-owned business in Erie, Pennsylvania, before a campaign rally later in the evening. Former President Barack Obama also weighed in, urging Black men to rally behind Harris, noting that some hesitation comes from her being a woman.Protecting cryptocurrency investors and expanding educationHarris' agenda includes regulations for cryptocurrency to safeguard investors. The campaign highlighted that more than 20% of Black Americans own or have owned cryptocurrency assets, signalling the importance of this measure.Harris also aims to expand education and mentorship opportunities for Black men. Key initiatives include increasing the number of Black male teachers, promoting registered apprenticeships, and enhancing the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness Programme to attract and retain Black male educators.Health equity initiativeFurthermore, Harris plans to launch a health equity initiative focused on addressing health issues disproportionately affecting African Americans, including sickle cell disease, diabetes, and mental health challenges.",
