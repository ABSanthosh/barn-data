  "text": "Two men have been arrested in connection with a drone attack in January that killed three U.S. troops and injured more than 40 others at a military base in Jordan.They are accused of violating export laws by leaking sensitive American technology information to Iran, which U.S. officials said allegedly helped that country launch the attack.One of the men — Mahdi Mohammad Sadeghi — is an Iranian American citizen living in Massachusetts who was arrested Monday, Justice Department officials said at a news conference. The second man — Mohammad Abedini — is an Iranian citizen who was arrested in Italy and could be extradited to the United States. His last name is listed in court records as Abedininajafabadi, but officials referred to him as Abedini during the news conference.Sadeghi works for a Massachusetts-based semiconductor company, and Abedini has a Iran-based company, prosecutors said.Abedini — who prosecutors said is charged with violating anti-terrorism laws as well as export laws — is accused of establishing a front company in Switzerland as a cover to obtain technology from the Massachusetts company where Sadeghi worked.Joshua Levy, the U.S. attorney in Massachusetts, said Sadeghi funneled items from that company to Iran. Those items were allegedly used to make at least one of the drones used in the deadly attack in Jordan. “These charges today underscore that the Department of Justice will not cease in its efforts to seek justice for service members who are killed or harmed overseas,” Levy said.The Jan. 28 attack was launched on sleeping quarters at a small U.S. outpost in Jordan, near the country’s borders with Syria and Iraq. It killed three U.S. soldiers — Sgt. William J. Rivers, 46, and Specs. Breonna Moffett, 23, and Kennedy L. Sanders, 24 — and wounded several dozen others. The United States launched scores of airstrikes on militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen in the days that followed.The bloodshed in Jordan followed weeks of attacks by Iran-backed militias on U.S. forces in the region after the beginning of the war in Gaza triggered by the Oct. 7, 2022 Hamas attacks on southern Israel.While earlier attempts to target U.S. forces had either been repelled or largely ineffective, the Jordan attack exposed gaps in U.S. capabilities and confusion over whether to target the incoming drone or not. No air-defense system at the base, known as Tower 22, was capable of shooting down the unmanned aircraft. U.S. military officials later assessed that the threat may have been missed because of its low flight path, and said the military needs better drone-detection systems to give U.S. troops more time to identify incoming threats.Hamas, along with Houthi rebels in Yemen and the militias in Iraq and Syria, receive training and weapons from Iranian forces, combining to form a network of proxy forces that Iran has utilized to expand its reach across the Middle East.Attacks on U.S. forces became less frequent after the retaliatory airstrikes by the United States, but have continued to occur on occasion, defense officials said, including as recently as early this month on a U.S. military position in Syria.Sanders’s mother, Oneida, said on Monday that her family was grateful to authorities for doing a thorough investigation. “We feel that this is a major development in the case that will open up more possibilities to bring all those involved to justice,” she said.Moffett’s mother, Francine, also said her family was grateful to the FBI and Justice Department for bringing justice to her family. “But no amount of Justice will bring our Baby back or heal my heart,” she wrote in a text message.",
