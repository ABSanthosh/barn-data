  "text": "US President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of an additional 1,500 military personnel to the border with Mexico as part of a series of measures to address immigration, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. This deployment will increase the total number of active-duty troops at the border to approximately 4,000, with border security being a top priority for the president since declaring a national emergency at the US-Mexico border on his first day in office.The reinforcements comprise 1,000 Army personnel and 500 Marines, according to a senior US military official at the Pentagon, as reported by AFP. The Marines, previously designated for California wildfire support but not utilised, have been reassigned to the border operation.\"These forces will work on the placement of physical barriers and other border missions. First operations for them should commence within the next 24 to 48 hours; they're moving right now,\" the senior military official said.The official also anticipates the deployment of additional airborne intelligence, surveillance, and support assets to enhance situational awareness at the border. Acting defense secretary Robert Salesses stated that the US military will assist with flights to deport migrants out of the country.\"The department will provide military airlift to support DHS (Department of Homeland Security) deportation flights of more than five thousand illegal aliens from the San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas sectors,\" Salesses said in a statement.The senior military official confirmed that the deportation effort will involve approximately 100 US military personnel. The deployment of additional troops is considered an initial effort, with many additional missions expected to follow, according to a senior defense official.From Day 1 in office, Trump has remained firm with crackdown on illegal immigration. Trump has claimed that he's fine with legal immigrants but soon after he took office, an app that streamlined the legal process was shut down. This has left many waiting at the Mexico-US border in disillusion and feeling defeated.",
