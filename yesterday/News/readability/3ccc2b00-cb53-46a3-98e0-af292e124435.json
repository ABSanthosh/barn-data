  "text": "A photo of a young Kamala Harris donning a blue dress apparently of McDonald's when she did a stint there has gone viral. But MAGA supporters pointed out that it was a doctored image shared mostly by pro-Kamala Harris accounts on X. They shared the original image of a McDonald's staff which they claimed had been manipulated to put Kamala Harris' face. Working at McDonald's emerged as a key flashpoint between the GOP and the Democrats as Donald Trump claimed Kamala Harris lied about working at McDonald's 41 years ago. To emulate her 'false claim', Donald Trump last Sunday worked a shift at a McDonald's outlet in Pennsylvania and said he worked 15 minutes more than Kamala Harris because Kamala Harris never worked at any McDonald's -- as there is no record of it. “We have checked with McDonald’s, and they say, definitively, that there is no record of Lyin’ Kamala Harris ever having worked there,” Trump wrote after his McDonald's shift. “In other words, she never worked there, and has lied about this ‘job’ for years.”The truth of Kamala Harris' McDonald's stintKamala Harris said she worked at a Bay Area McDonald's 41 years ago when she was in college in the summer of 1983. But the Trump campaign claimed that there has been no record of Kamala Harris working at McDonald's she claimed and hence she lied. But reports said it was a pre-digital era and no record found may not hint at 'never worked'.
