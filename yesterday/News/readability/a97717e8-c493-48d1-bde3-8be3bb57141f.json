Musk dismissed the article as \"pure propaganda\" and advocated for legal proceedings against those who leaked information.Meanwhile Trump expressed concerns about Elon Musk's Chinese business connections whilst standing with Hegseth, suggesting these ties might pose security risks if classified military information were to be disclosed to him.Following the White House meeting, Donald Trump expressed reluctance about sharing American strategic plans regarding potential conflict with China, alluding to Musk's possible divided loyalties.\"I don't want to show that to anybody. But certainly you wouldn't show it to a businessman, who is helping us so much,\" Reuters quoted Donald Trump said. \"Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that,\" Trump said.",
