  "text": "The World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai in July 2023.Aly Song | ReutersAlibaba is cutting prices on its large language models by up to 85%, the Chinese tech giant announced Tuesday.The Hangzhou-based e-commerce firm's cloud computing division, Alibaba Cloud, said in a WeChat post that it's offering the price cuts on its visual language model, Qwen-VL, which is designed to perceive and understand both texts and images.Shares of Alibaba didn't move much on the announcement, closing 0.5% higher on the final trading day of the year in Hong Kong.Nevertheless, the price cuts demonstrate how the race among China's technology giants to win more business for their nascent artificial intelligence products is intensifying.Major Chinese tech firms including Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, JD.com, Huawei and TikTok parent company Bytedance have all launched their own large language models over the past 18 months, looking to capitalize on the hype around the technology.It's not the first time Alibaba has announced price cuts to incentivize businesses to use its AI products. In February, the company announced price reductions of as much as 55% on a wide range of core cloud products. More recently, in May, the company reduced prices on its Qwen AI model by as much as 97% in a bid to boost demand.Large language models, or LLMs for short, are AI models that are trained on vast quantities of data to generate humanlike responses to user queries and prompts. They are the bedrock for today's generative AI systems, like Microsoft-backed startup OpenAI's popular AI chatbot, ChatGPT.In Alibaba's case, the company is focusing its LLM efforts on the enterprise segment rather than launching a consumer AI chatbot like OpenAI's ChatGPT. In May, the company said its Qwen models have been deployed by over 90,000 enterprise users.",
