  "text": "Donald Trump said he would not deport Prince Harry.Royal experts think President Donald Trump made a funny comment when he said he won't deport Prince Harry from the United States as he already has a terrible wife, Meghan Markle but Harry should now keep his head down and focus on his charitable works. British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard told Fox News that Trump admired the Royal family and won;t unnecessarily jeopardize his relationship with the working members. \"His stance is America first,\" said Chard. \"He is strong on border control, immigration and deportation. Despite his funny statement highlighting he won't deport Harry, he could well have a change of heart if Harry is found guilty of lying on his visa documents. Prince Harry could be the perfect poster boy… however, Trump dislikes Meghan and deporting Meghan is not on the cards.\"Meghan Markle is an American and after their exit from the Royal Family, Harry and Meghan made Montecito their home, though Heritage Foundation filed a lawsuit against Harry questioning whether Harry disclosed in his visa forms that he took marijuana, cocaine as he acknowledged in his memoir which was published years after he came to the US. \"Trump speaks highly and values our monarchy,\" said Chard. \"For this reason, he is giving poor hoodwinked Harry a right to stay in the US. Prince Harry is a small fry for Trump to bother with. He has more important issues to deal with.\"\"I always doubted that Harry would be deported over the visa application issue,\" Royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams said. \"Donald Trump values his relationship with the royal family. And to have the fifth in line to the throne fighting to avoid being deported, if he hadn't revealed his drug taking, would have been an undignified cause celebre. We know they have a mutual antipathy.\"What Donald Trump said on Harry and MeghanIn an interview to the New York Post, Donald Trump said he would leave Harry alone as he already has several problems because of his terrible wife Meghan Markle. It came across as a hilarious comment but an insult to both Harry and Meghan who are no fans of Trump either.",
