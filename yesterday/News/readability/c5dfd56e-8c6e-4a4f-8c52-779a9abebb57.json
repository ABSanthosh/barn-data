Trump made it clear that Elon Musk reports to him and he is not doing anything without approval. The concerns mounted after Elon Musk's DOGE team was given access to the federal government's payments system and then Elon Musk announced that he would put an end to the US Agency for International Development. Trump said Elon has got access only to letting people go but only if the administration agrees with him.\"Elon got access only to letting people go that he thinks are no good if we agree with him and it's only if we agree with him. He's a very talented guy from the standpoint of management and costs and we put him in charge of seeing what he could do with certain groups and certain numbers. Some of the numbers are horrible what he's found. A 100 million dollar for condoms to Hamas and many other things frankly ore ridiculous,\" Trump said.\"They are finding a tremendous amount of waste, really waste more than anything else I think you could say. Probably fraud and abuse can be added to that. But they are finding tremendous amounts of really bad things, bad spending.\"\"Elon can’t do and won’t do anything without our approval. And we’ll give him the approval where appropriate, and where not appropriate we won’t. But he reports in and it's something that he feels very strongly about. I am impressed because he obviously runs a very big company, has nothing to do with it. If there's a conflict, we won't let him go near it. But he does have a good natural instinct and a team of very talented people. We are trying to shrink the government and he can. probably shrink it as well as anybody else can if not better. Where we think there's a conflict or a problem, we won't let him go near it,\" Trump said.",
