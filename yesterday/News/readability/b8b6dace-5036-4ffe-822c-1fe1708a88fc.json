  "text": "BEIRUT — Israeli attacks killed scores of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, authorities there said, as troops expanded ground operations inside the shattered enclave and the Trump administration expressed its full support.At least 85 people were killed, the Gaza Health Ministry said, and more were trapped under the rubble. The strikes brought the death toll over the past 72 hours to more than 500 people, the ministry said, 312 of them women or children. Israel said it had “eliminated” the head of Hamas’s General Security Forces and its chief in its Khan Younis sector.Hamas fired back with rockets for the first time since Israel resumed strikes on the territory this week, breaking an internationally mediated ceasefire, as the conflict threatened to return to all-out war.Hamas’s military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, described the launches as retaliation for the “massacres against civilians.” The Israel Defense Forces said three projectiles were fired from Gaza. One was intercepted, the IDF said; the others fell in open terrain, causing no injuries.Israel announced fresh ground incursions and threatened strikes elsewhere as the day unfolded. The IDF was operating in the southern city of Rafah and along the coastal highway in the northern city of Beit Lahia. Gazans were again prohibited from moving between north and south on Salah al-Din, the enclave’s main road, a spokesman said. He warned residents in the southern municipality of Bani Suheila, where he said militants were firing rockets, to head west for their own safety.Israel blocked all food, fuel and aid to Gaza more than two weeks ago. An estimated 70,000 Palestinians have fled Israeli strikes and the renewed ground offensive so far, deepening the misery of a shocked and exhausted population that has been displaced multiple times.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump had warned Hamas there would be “hell to pay” if the militants did not release the 59 hostages whom they and other groups have been holding in Gaza since their Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Of the 59, 24 are believed to be alive.“The president has made it very clear that he wants all of those hostages to come home, and he fully supports Israel and the IDF and the actions that they’ve taken in recent days,” Leavitt told reporters in Washington.Family members of the hostages have called repeatedly for a deal to secure their release. Many relatives expressed horror at the possibility that the resumption of fighting this week could further imperil their relatives. Protesters at demonstrations around the country have warned that time is running out to save those who are still alive.Crowds tried to breach barriers near one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residences in Jerusalem. Police responded with water cannons and knocked a former member of parliament to the ground, local media reported.The offensive is aimed at pressuring Hamas to release more hostages, Israeli officials said. They said Thursday that they had killed General Security Forces leader Rashid Jahjuh and Khan Younis sector chief Ayman Atsalih.But Israeli and U.S. analysts said the likelihood of extending the ceasefire was low and the chance Israel would resume an all-out assault was soaring. Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior U.S. intelligence official, said the conflict was quickly barreling toward an end scenario of an Israeli military occupation of Gaza that would last months, if not years.Netanyahu and other officials have vowed publicly in recent weeks to fully eliminate Hamas’s influence. “The default is going to be an Israeli military occupation of Gaza,” said Panikoff, now a fellow at the Atlantic Council. “There’s nothing that says Hamas is ready for a new deal immediately, or that the Israelis are ready. Both the current Israeli government coalition and Hamas are in maximalist positions that do not have meaningful overlap.”Itamar Ben Gvir, the leader of the far-right Jewish Power party, said this week that he welcomed Israel’s return to “intense fighting” and would rejoin Netanyahu’s coalition government ahead of a critical vote to keep it in power.The return to war follows plans drafted over recent weeks that allow the army to escalate in phases to pressure Hamas back to negotiations, Israeli officials said.At least six of the dead in Gaza in recent days were employees of the United Nations, officials said. An explosion at a U.N. guesthouse in Deir al-Balah on Wednesday killed a Bulgarian national and wounded five others. Five others have been killed since Tuesday, the head of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency said Thursday, bringing the total since the war started to 284.“They were teachers, doctors and nurses: serving the most vulnerable,” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said on X.Israel recaptured part of the Netzarim Corridor that bisects Gaza and deployed an infantry brigade along the enclave’s perimeter Wednesday, officials said. The ban on crossing the corridor Thursday sparked panicked discussions among Gazans about where, if anywhere, was safe. Many worried that if Israel besieged the north, they could again be separated on either side of the enclave indefinitely.Ahmed was on the move Thursday trying to find refuge in Gaza City. He spoke on the condition that his last name be withheld to protect his privacy.Ahmed, who returned to the north last month, was staying in a shelter on a road near the Netzarim Corridor. The area was the site of frequent violence during the war, and he feared it was unsafe now.He had a lead on a clinic where he might stay elsewhere in Gaza City. But every move brings complications. He has spent the war trying to protect his two prized cars from airstrikes and thieves. Relocating his family was costly and dangerous each time.Another resident, Ghadeer Ayoub, 33, said she had felt “constant anxiety” since Israel renewed its attacks. Her parents left Deir al-Balah at the start of the ceasefire in January to return to their home in Beit Lahia; she stayed to work. On Thursday, she said, they told her clearly: They would not leave their land again unless the north faces another ground invasion or a siege. It had been too difficult for them to get back there.“It’s not easy for them to leave their land,” she told The Washington Post by text. “They will stay in the north for as long as they can.”But the thundering resumption of attacks moved more quickly than her parents had anticipated. Within hours, Ayoub said, they were grappling with what to do. “They can’t make a decision,” Ayoub said.Gazans could still move south using the coastal road, the IDF said Thursday, but some expressed fear they could be shot along the route.“Maybe they could set up a tent in Gaza City, or somewhere else that’s empty,” Ayoub said. But she was also grappling with where she might go if troops advanced toward her location. In Deir al-Balah, news footage Thursday showed long bread lines forming.Loveluck reported from London. Shih and Berger reported from Jerusalem. Mohammed El Chamaa in Beirut and Lior Soroka and Shira Rubin in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.",
