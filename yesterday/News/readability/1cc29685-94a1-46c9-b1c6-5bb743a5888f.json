  "text": "Moscow: Ukraine on Sunday launched one of its largest drone-based operations on Russia to date, striking five air bases deep inside Russian territory.\"Today, the Kyiv regime staged a terror attack with the use of FPV drones on airfields in the Murmansk, Irkutsk, Ivanovo, Ryazan, and Amur Regions. All terror attacks on military airfields in the Ivanovo, Ryazan, and Amur Regions were repelled. No casualties were reported either among servicemen or civilians. Some of those involved in the terror attacks were detained,\" the Russian defence ministry said in a statement.Russia said several of its aircraft \"caught fire\" in the attacks. \"As a result of the launch of FPV drones from territories in the close proximity to military airfields in the Murmansk and Irkutsk Regions, several aircraft caught fire. The fires were extinguished,\" the statement said.Ukraine, however, said at least 40 aircraft had been damaged specified that they included nuclear capable TU-95 and Tu-22 strategic bombers. Among the attacks was one on a military unit in the village of Sridni, the first such attack in Siberia, confirmed by Russian governor of the Irkutsk region.The attacks were aimed at destroying enemy bombers far from the front in Russia, sources told news agency AFP, adding that a fire broke out at the Belaya air base, one of the military installations which was targeted.  Ukrainian media claimed that the large-scale special operation was conducted by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU). Army and civilian responders have already been mobilised to tackle the threat, and the source of the drone launch has been blocked, according to an RT report.❗️Russia's Irkutsk region governor confirms 1st DRONE attack in SiberiaSays military unit targetedArmy and civilian responders already mobilized to tackle threat, source of drone launch blocked pic.twitter.com/jMgCajhXbT— RT (@RT_com) June 1, 2025The attacks come as Russia and Ukraine are scheduled to begin a second round of peace talks in Istanbul on Monday. The Russian delegation led by Kremlin aide Vladimir Medynsky has already reached Turkey.How The Attack Was PlannedThe operation has been launched under a special operation code-named \"Pavutyna\" - or \"Spider Web\" - aimed at degrading Russia's long-range strike capabilities, according to a Ukrainian publication, Pravda.Ukraine reportedly planned the attack for a year. The drones were hidden in mobile wooden sheds, which were placed on cargo trucks. At chosen times, the roofs of trucks opened remotely, giving time for drones to flow out and target the chosen airbases.Ukraine, which lacks Russia's vast arsenal of missiles, has instead built up a large fleet of attack drones, which it has used to attack Russian military and oil facilities in the past as well.Russia had proposed a fresh round of talks in Istanbul on Monday, a proposal that was accepted by Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that a delegation led by his minister Rustem Umerov will be in Istanbul on Monday for talks with Russia.\"I have also defined our position before the Monday meeting in Istanbul\", which includes priorities to reach \"a complete and unconditional ceasefire\" and the return of prisoners and abducted children, he said on social media on Sunday.",
