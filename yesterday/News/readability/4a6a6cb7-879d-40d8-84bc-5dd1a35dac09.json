  "text": "TEL AVIV — Deadly Israeli airstrikes hit a school turned shelter and other targets in Gaza on Monday, according to rescue workers and witnesses, as a controversial new private aid organization with ties to both the Israeli and U.S. governments said it began distributing food inside the enclave.Faris Afana, an ambulance driver in Gaza who was at the scene of the strike, said that civil defense crews demolished walls to reach victims trapped under burning debris. He said he counted at least 30 fatalities and that, with many more suffering severe burns, he expected the death toll to rise.“The school is very large and shelters thousands of displaced people; even the courtyards and playgrounds are filled with tents,” Afana said. He said the school “showed no signs of any armed presence.”The strikes killed at least 25 people, according to Zaher al-Wahidi, an official at the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says most of those killed in the war are women and children.The Israeli military said in a statement that the strike targeted an active intelligence “command and control center” operated by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group in the Strip.On Monday morning, three missiles were fired from Gaza into southern Israel.The Israeli strikes came as uncertainty continued to swirl around humanitarian aid deliveries into the enclave.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) said in an emailed announcement that it began “delivering truckloads of food to its Secure Distribution Sites, where distribution to the Gaza people began” Monday.Goods to stock the Secure Distribution Site One, near the Philadelphi Corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, were transported early Monday accompanied by U.S. security contractors who also guarded the site, according to two people familiar with the operation. The number of Gazans who showed up to the site — located in an area near Rafah city that has been largely destroyed and bulldozed by Israel — was relatively small, the people said, and no incidents were initially reported.The GHF posted photographs of what it said were Gazans carrying boxes of aid away from the site.The opening came in the wake of resignations by the two senior officials of the organization. Jake Wood, who resigned as executive director, said in a statement late Sunday that the group’s plans could not be consistent with what he called the “humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence.” The chief operating officer, David Burke, also resigned, according to people familiar with the situation who, like others discussing the aid situation, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Burke could not be reached for comment.John Acree, a former USAID official who served as the GHF mission director in Gaza, was named as interim executive director.The GHF is a nonprofit registered both in Switzerland and Delaware and backed by the United States and Israel, which aims to use armed private contractors to provide security at Israeli-designated corridors and distribution “hubs,” from which aid groups would distribute food packages to vetted Gazans.Wood’s resignation comes two months after he was approached to lead the organization and amounted to a vote of no confidence in the foundation’s plan, which has faced skepticism from humanitarian agencies about its feasibility and morality since its inception. The United Nations and established humanitarian groups have repeatedly voiced their refusal to work with the group, citing concerns that its plans to get aid into Gaza violate humanitarian principles, would militarize aid delivery and could force further displacement of Palestinians, which is a war crime.In an emailed statement late Sunday, the remaining GHF board said that it was “disappointed” to learn of Wood’s resignation but that its work would continue and it was aiming to reach more than a million Gazans by the end of the week. The office of the Israeli prime minister did not respond to requests for comment on the beginning of the government-sanctioned aid operations.In Jerusalem, Israeli officials repeated promises to keep fighting until Hamas is destroyed or disarmed, and until it returns the remaining 58 hostages the militants still hold inside Gaza.As negotiations including representatives of Israel, Hamas and the United States continued in Doha, Qatar, there were conflicting reports that an agreement had been reached to release at least some of the hostages held in exchange for an interim ceasefire leading to negotiations, under U.S. auspices, for a permanent one and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.Hamas spokespeople said at various times the group had agreed to the plan. U.S. negotiator Steve Witkoff differed with that description of the proposal and said in an interview with CNN that Hamas had not agreed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that “I hope we’ll be able to announce something regarding this issue — if not today, then tomorrow.” An Israeli official later told Ynet news site that the prime minister was referring to “the near future, not specifically today or tomorrow.”Meanwhile, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said, “To our enemies I say today once again: Israel will never surrender to terrorism.” He spoke alongside visiting U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi L. Noem and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who attended a memorial event for the two Israeli embassy employees shot dead in Washington, D.C., by a pro-Palestinian gunman last week.As Israel expanded military operations in Gaza last week, Netanyahu said he would allow “minimal” aid to enter the enclave, describing potential mass starvation there as a “red line” that could cost Israel support from allies, including the United States.Israel’s recent operations in Gaza have drawn rebukes from some of its staunchest allies and prompted them to reexamine their relationships with Netanyahu’s government. Britain is suspending free-trade negotiations with Israel, and the European Union is reviewing commercial ties. On Monday, Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany, told broadcaster WDR: “Harming the civilian population to such an extent, as has increasingly been the case in recent days, can no longer be justified as a fight against Hamas terrorism.”Earlier, on Sunday, President Donald Trump said, “Israel, we’ve been talking to them, and we want to see if we can stop that whole situation as quickly as possible.”Israel, which was instrumental in developing the GHF mechanism, and the United States, which has promoted the GHF as a U.S. initiative and tried to encourage funding for it, have both expressed hopes that it will prevent Hamas from seizing and reselling humanitarian aid from which they charge the militants have generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. But Israel has never presented proof to corroborate that claim to Western officials or humanitarian organizations, The Washington Post has reported.The GHF has been questioned about whether it had sufficient funding, with major potential donor countries in Europe and Asia backing away, and whether it had a viable logistical plan — including how it will work with the Israel Defense Forces — to distribute aid to hundreds of thousands of Gazans.The foundation could also be subject to investigations in Switzerland after TRIAL International, a Swiss nongovernmental group that supports victims of war crimes, said it had asked Swiss authorities to investigate the foundation to see whether its mission aligned with Swiss and international humanitarian law. Swiss authorities are exploring a potential investigation, Switzerland’s Federal Department of Foreign Affairs said, while declining to comment on ongoing investigations.Ahead of the GHF starting operations, Israel said it had allowed about 500 U.N. trucks, largely providing flour, to enter Gaza in the past week. Relief workers say the population needs at least 500 trucks of food a day.Cheeseman reported from Beirut and DeYoung from Washington. Cate Brown in Washington, Andrew Jeong in Seoul, Mustafa Salim in Baghdad and Lior Soroka in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.correctionA previous version of this article incorrectly said that GHF had envisioned using private guards to vet aid recipients. The plan was for them only to provide security for transport and aid distribution sites.",
