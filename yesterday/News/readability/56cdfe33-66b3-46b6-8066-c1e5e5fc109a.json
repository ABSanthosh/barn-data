Earlier this week, he visited Saudi Arabia and Qatar on the first major international visit of his second term.Here are five takeaways from Mr. Trump’s trip:He broke the diplomatic ice with Syria.Mr. Trump spoke with Syria’s new president, Ahmed al-Shara, on Wednesday in an extraordinary meeting that reversed longstanding U.S. policies toward the country and Mr. al-Shara. A former militant who once led a branch of Al Qaeda, Mr. al-Shara came to power as the head of the rebel alliance that ousted the former dictator Bashar al-Assad in December.A day earlier, Mr. Trump had announced that he would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, which would offer a significant economic lifeline to Mr. al-Shara as he tries to rebuild a country devastated by years of civil war. His unexpected announcement drew enthusiastic applause from a crowd of dignitaries in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Big deals were announced, but details were lacking.The White House has said Mr. Trump’s visit resulted in deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars for U.S. companies, including a large order from Qatar for Boeing passenger jets.But details have been sparse and some of the agreements had already been in the works. In the case of the Boeing deal, Mr. Trump boasted that it was worth $200 billion, but a fact sheet from the White House said the true number was $96 billion.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
