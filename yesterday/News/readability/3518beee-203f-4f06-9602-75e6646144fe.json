  "text": "Israel is bracing for a distressing moment as Hamas is set to return the bodies of four hostages, including three members of the Bibas family, on Thursday.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged the loss, calling it \"a very difficult day for the State of Israel – a heartbreaking day, a day of grief. We are bringing home four of our beloved hostages – fallen heroes.\"The deaths of Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel, 5, and Kfir, 2, the youngest hostages held by Hamas, were described as \"heart-shattering\" by an Israeli group campaigning for hostage releases.Shiri’s husband, Yarden Bibas, was abducted separately on October 7, 2023, but was released on February 1 as part of a previous hostage-prisoner exchange.Hamas has claimed that Shiri Bibas and her two sons were killed in an Israeli air strike early in the war, though Israel has never confirmed this. The Bibas family had continued to hope they were still alive. \"We have held onto hope for 16 months, and we are not giving up now,\" wrote the boys' aunt, Ofri Bibas, on Facebook.Hamas has signalled a willingness to free all remaining hostages in a single swap during the next phase of the ceasefire. \"We have informed the mediators that Hamas is ready to release all hostages in one batch during the second phase of the agreement, rather than in stages as in the current first phase,\" said senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu.The Israel-Hamas ceasefire has been in effect since January 19 and has so far led to the release of 19 Israeli hostages in exchange for over 1,100 Palestinian prisoners.The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has mediated the hostage exchanges, urged all sides to ensure a respectful transfer of the remains. \"We once again call for all releases to be conducted in a private and dignified manner, including when they tragically involve the deceased,\" the organisation said.On October 7, 2023, Hamas and its allies took 251 people hostage during an attack on Israel. Of these, 70 remain in Gaza, including 35 whom the Israeli military believes are dead.The attack resulted in the deaths of 1,211 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures. Israel’s retaliatory campaign has killed over 48,000 people in Gaza according Gaza health ministry.",
