  "text": "Al Jazeera said it denies and “vehemently condemns” a claim by the Israel Defense Forces that six of its journalists were affiliated with militant groups in the Gaza Strip.The Israeli military said Wednesday that it uncovered documents linking six of the Qatar-based network’s journalists, whom it named, to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.Al Jazeera called the accusation “a blatant attempt to silence the few remaining journalists in the region.” The network said the journalists have been reporting from northern Gaza, where Israel launched a major operation this month.On Thursday, the IDF published three alleged Hamas documents that it said showed “cooperation” between the network and Hamas, including two from 2022 allegedly offering directives for coverage and a third from 2023 saying the group should “establish a secure communication channel” between Hamas’s emergency operations center and Al-Jazeera. The documents published by the military include colored annotations and English translations added by the IDF.The documents have not been independently verified, nor is it clear whether the documents were received by Al Jazeera, or if its recommendations were acted on by the news organization.In a statement to The Washington Post on Thursday, Al Jazeera rejected the “persistent false” allegations, saying it has “never shied away from broadcasting a story or hosting a guest who is relevant or integral to a narrative.” It says it “openly hosts and reflects all views and opinions” and covers news stories “in-depth and from all sides, without censorship or bias.”The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was “aware” of the accusation, adding that “Israel has repeatedly made similar unproven claims without producing credible evidence.”One of the journalists named by the IDF, Hossam Shabat, described Israel’s accusations as “fabricated dossiers framing us.” He said it was part of a “systematic propaganda campaign to justify the unjustifiable.”“This blatant and belligerent attempt to transform us, the last witnesses in the north, into killable targets is an assassination threat,” Shabat tweeted Wednesday. He said that he and his colleagues plan to continue reporting the facts on the ground.Another of the journalists, Talal al-Arouqi, said the IDF accused him of joining Hamas when he was 16. “How could I have joined such groups at that age and continued working in the media field afterward?” he said in a video statement released Wednesday.“These fabrications are part of an incitement campaign against Al Jazeera, its media network and its employees in Gaza,” Arouqi said.At least 128 journalists and media workers, 123 of them Palestinian, have been killed during the war, according to the CPJ. Al Jazeera journalists have been among those killed and injured, including cameraman Fadi al-Wahidi, who was shot in the neck and put in a coma while reporting from Jabalya on Oct. 9. Another Al Jazeera cameraman was severely injured two days prior.The press freedom nonprofit said the IDF previously claimed that Al Jazeera journalist Ismail al-Ghoul had received a Hamas military ranking in 2007, “when he would have been 10 years old.” Al Jazeera has denied the allegations. Ghoul was killed in an Israeli airstrike in July. When asked for evidence by The Post in August, the IDF said it had “no further comment.”Al Jazeera, which was established in 1996 and is backed by the Qatari government, has long been a target of censorship and criticism by the Israeli government, which accuses it of bias and propaganda. Israel shut down Al Jazeera’s operations in the country in May. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused its correspondents of having “harmed the security of Israel,” calling the channel “Hamas’s mouthpiece.”Al Jazeera in its Wednesday statement reaffirmed its commitment to “delivering accurate, impartial reporting from conflict zones, despite the grave risks and baseless accusations.”The network “remains committed to revealing the full extent of the calamity inflicted upon the Gazan population,” it added Thursday.",
