  "text": "Here’s the latest on the hostage and prisoner exchange.Israel on Thursday released more than 100 Palestinian prisoners — including some convicted of deadly attacks against Israelis — in exchange for hostages held in Gaza after a chaotic Hamas-led hostage handover in Gaza cast doubt on whether it would go ahead.Hamas released a total of eight Israeli and Thai hostages after a year in captivity, including one in a tightly choreographed ceremony in northern Gaza that went relatively smoothly. But in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, the handover devolved into tumult, with the hostages surrounded by crowds of people, including some chanting support for Hamas or other armed groups.The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said after that tumult that he had suspended the prisoners’ release until cease-fire mediators — which included Qatar, Egypt and the United States — secured guarantees from Hamas of “the safe exit of our hostages in the next rounds.”The government later said that mediators had guaranteed the hostages safe passage in future releases. Not long after, buses carrying 110 Palestinian prisoners were seen leaving the Ofer prison in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.The Palestinian prisoners were being freed as part of the third hostage-for-prisoner swap in the ongoing cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas. During the first 42 days of the agreement, Hamas pledged to free at least 33 hostages in exchange for over 1,500 Palestinians jailed by Israel.On Thursday, large numbers of Palestinians gathered before the hostage release in Khan Younis near the home of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s leader in Gaza who was killed by Israel in October. A small white van surrounded by armed gunmen slowly pushed its way through yelling crowds of people seeking any glimpse of the captives.The militants later carved a path through the surging crowd as many pushed their way to the front with cameras. Photos and video showed hostages walking through the chaotic crowd. In one video, Arbel Yehud, 29, one of the last living female hostages, at times appeared afraid while surrounded by rifle-wielding militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad as they made their way toward the Red Cross convoy that would take her to Israeli soldiers.Under the terms of the cease-fire, Israel is to release 110 Palestinian prisoners on Thursday, including 32 serving life sentences for deadly attacks against Israelis. One of them is Zakaria Zubeidi, who was a prominent militant in the north of the Israeli-occupied West Bank during the second intifada. He joined a 2021 prison break before being arrested again.Here’s what else to know:A closer look: The three released Israeli hostages include a young Israeli army lookout, an 80-year-old farming expert and a woman who worked as a guide at a space and technology center.Thai hostages: The Thai hostages were abducted during the Hamas-led attack in 2023 from four farms close to the Gaza border, where they were agricultural workers. Dozens of Thai farmworkers were kidnapped or killed during the assault, making them the second-largest group of victims in the Oct. 7 attack, after Israelis.Exiled prisoners: About 20 of the Palestinian prisoners are set to be expelled abroad and will not be allowed to return to their homes in the West Bank or Jerusalem, according to the Hamas-linked prisoners’ office. Expelled prisoners can head to the Gaza Strip or leave for Egypt, where discussions over their final destination are ongoing, according to the Palestinian commissioner for prisoners’ affairs.Palestinians gather in the West Bank to welcome prisoners released by Israel.ImageFreed Palestinian prisoners in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Thursday.Credit...Ahmad Gharabli/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesImageA Palestinian prisoner is greeted in the West Bank city of Ramallah, on Thursday.Credit...Nasser Nasser/Associated PressImageBuses carrying the freed prisoners make their way through the crowd.Credit...ReutersSamar Faisal stood among a crowd in the crisp winter air, shivering as much from her excitement as the cold. She was in disbelief, she said, that this day had come. Her brother, after spending more than 20 years in an Israeli prison, was being released.“I’m anxious and praying for the moment I finally see him,” Ms. Faisal said, as volunteers in fluorescent vests hurried by. Her brother had been jailed for fighting in the armed wing of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which the United States and European Union designate a terrorist group.Ms. Faisal was among a throng of Palestinian families gathered in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Thursday, eagerly waiting to welcome more than 100 Palestinian prisoners being released from Israel in exchange for hostages held in Gaza. It was the third hostage-for-prisoner swap in an ongoing cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas. During the first 42 days of the agreement, Hamas has pledged to free at least 33 hostages in exchange for over 1,500 Palestinians jailed by Israel.Standing outside a government recreation center, people restlessly checked their phones for news or fielded calls from loved ones who were anxious for updates.Finally, around 7 p.m., a chain of buses arrived carrying dozens of Palestinian prisoners, including some who had been convicted of deadly attacks against Israelis. Sixty-seven prisoners arrived in Ramallah on Thursday, including 27 children, officials said. Another 14 arrived in Jerusalem and nine in Gaza, while 20 were sent to Egypt.Earlier in the day, Hamas had released eight Israeli and Thai hostages held in Gaza.For some waiting outside the recreation center, their anticipation was tempered by sorrow.Alaa Zubeidi waited with her sisters and friends, all dressed in the black clothes of mourning in memory of her eldest son, Mohammad, who was killed by an Israeli drone strike in the West Bank city of Tubas in September.She was awaiting the release of her husband, Zakariya Zubeidi, a former militant turned theater director whom Israeli forces arrested in 2019. He became well known in both Israel and the Palestinian territories in 2019 for briefly escaping an Israeli prison.The Zubeidi family was removed from their home in Jenin by Israeli forces after Mohammad’s death, and Ms. Zubeidi and two of her other children, Samira and Ayham, were arrested and detained for several hours. Since then, she said, operations by Palestinian security forces had left them unable to return to their home.But those concerns were eclipsed by joy after Mr. Zubeidi’s release on Thursday, when people in the crowd hoisted him onto their shoulders and chanted his name.Beaming, Mr. Zubeidi flashed the victory sign with both hands.“May God protect Jenin camp at this time,” he told the crowd. “Today is a public referendum in favor of the fighters.”VideoPalestinian militants released a total of eight Israeli and Thai hostages, and Israel released 110 Palestinian prisoners, in a chaotic third round of exchanges between the two sides as per the cease-fire agreement.CreditCredit...Nader IbrahimMuhammad Deif, Hamas Military Commander in Gaza, Is DeadImageAn undated handout photo said to be of Muhammad Deif, the Hamas military leader.Credit...via Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMuhammad Deif, the shadowy leader of Hamas’s military wing in Gaza and one of the chief architects of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that ignited a war, was confirmed by Hamas on Thursday to be dead. He was in his late 50s.Mr. Deif, whose real name was Muhammad al-Masri, was one of the most senior Hamas leaders inside Gaza, and he was one of Israel’s most-wanted militants for decades. He survived a number of Israeli assassination attempts before the one that killed him and was lionized by some Palestinians as a symbol of Hamas’s resilience — albeit an enigmatic one.While Israel announced in August that he had been killed, Abu Obeida, the spokesman of Hamas’s military wing, only acknowledged his death on Thursday in a recorded video statement. Both Israel and the United States considered him a terrorist with their citizens’ blood on his hands.Mr. Deif was killed on July 13, Israel said, when its forces bombed a compound on the outskirts of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, according to the Israeli military — making him one of the most senior Hamas commanders slain inside Gaza in the war. Mr. Obeida did not say when or where Mr. Deif was killed.The strike that killed Mr. Deif also killed at least 90 Palestinians on the ground, the Gaza health ministry said, hitting within the Al-Mawasi area of southern Gaza, a part of a humanitarian zone designated by Israel. The health ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its death tolls.The zone was a large expanse filled with hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians, many living in makeshift shelters, according to the United Nations. Israel said that Hamas was operating from the targeted compound within the zone.Mr. Deif was “the beating heart” of Hamas’s military wing and one of its most important military strategists, said Michael Milshtein, a former Israeli intelligence officer specializing in Palestinian affairs.There were few photographs of Mr. Deif in circulation, and he was rarely seen or heard from as he spent decades in hiding. His adopted name, “Deif,” means “guest” in Arabic, widely understood as a nod to the frequency with which he changed locations to avoid death or capture.He led the Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, and was credited with transforming what was once a diffuse network of armed cells into a formidable fighting force with tens of thousands in its ranks.“He’s a legendary figure in Hamas,” Ibrahim Madhoun, a Palestinian analyst close to Hamas, said before Mr. Deif’s death was confirmed by the militant group.ImageMr. Deif was killed in an Israeli strike on a compound in the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis in southern Gaza in July, Israel said.Credit...Haitham Imad/EPA, via ShutterstockBorn in 1965 to a poor Palestinian family, Mr. Deif grew up in the Khan Younis refugee camp in southern Gaza, not far from Yahya Sinwar, the top Hamas leader killed in October. In the 1980s, he studied at Islamic University of Gaza, focusing on the sciences, and joined Hamas around the time it was founded in the late 1980s.He quickly rose through the ranks, developing a reputation as a master bombmaker and orchestrating a number of attacks on Israel, including a series of deadly bus bombings that killed dozens of people and derailed the peace process in the mid-1990s.Not long after Hamas was founded, Israel imprisoned Mr. Deif for 16 months, starting in May 1989.Mr. Deif was also held by the Palestinian Authority for a short time starting in 2000. At that time, the Palestinian Authority was a governing body with limited autonomy over parts of the West Bank and Gaza, and it was dominated by Fatah, a Palestinian faction that rivaled Hamas.When a founder of the military wing of Hamas, Salah Shehadeh, was killed by an Israeli airstrike in 2002, Mr. Deif took the helm.He upgraded and expanded the production and importation of rockets and helped develop Hamas’s extensive tunnel network underneath Gaza. He also commanded the so-called Shadow Brigade, which guards Israeli captives held by Hamas, and oversaw investment in new technologies like reconnaissance drones for the Qassam Brigades, according to Mr. Madhoun, the analyst.Mr. Deif was believed to have lost an eye and suffered other serious wounds in the Israeli attempts to kill him, which often claimed the lives of others, including civilians. His ability to escape death — and oft-stated dedication to the destruction of Israel — enhanced his heroic status among some Palestinians.Israeli and Palestinian analysts also credited Mr. Deif with transforming the Qassam Brigades into something closer to a traditional army.ImageFighters from the Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, in the Gaza Strip in 2022. Mr. Deif was credited with transforming what was once a diffuse network of armed cells into a formidable force.Credit...Mohammed Saber/EPA, via ShutterstockMr. Deif was one of the top names on Israel’s most-wanted list for decades, and survived more than eight attempts on his life, according to Israeli intelligence. In 2015, the U.S. State Department labeled him as a “specially designated global terrorist.”He was the target of a 2002 missile strike by an Israeli helicopter on a busy street in Gaza City. In 2014, an Israeli airstrike killed one of his wives, an infant son and his 3-year-old daughter. During an earlier war with Hamas in Gaza in 2021, Israel’s military said it had tried to kill him several times.That war — launched by Hamas after Israeli efforts to evict Palestinians from their homes in East Jerusalem and Israeli police raids of the Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem’s Old City — was a turning point, Osama Hamdan, a Hamas leader based in Beirut, later told The New York Times.Over the next few years, Hamas enhanced its military abilities.It stockpiled about 15,000 rockets along with mortars, antitank missiles and portable air-defense systems, according to American and other Western analysts. And its leaders — Mr. Deif and Mr. Sinwar — drew up closely guarded plans for the Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel, as Hamas fighters trained on flying paragliders and taking hostages.Once the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel got underway, Mr. Deif released a rare message. He declared that Hamas had decided to launch an operation so that “the enemy will understand that the time of their rampaging without accountability has ended,” speaking in a recorded address.“Righteous fighters, this is your day to bury this criminal enemy,” he said. “Its time has finished. Kill them wherever you find them. Remove this filth from your land and your sacred places. Fight and the angels fight with you.”The Oct. 7, 2023, attack has come to symbolize one of the greatest intelligence failures in Israel’s history and the shattering of its image as an impenetrable military power. It was the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. Some 1,200 people were killed in the rampage and roughly 250 were taken hostage.The attack ignited a devastating war that killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, including civilians. The 470-day war displaced most of the people in Gaza, led to a hunger crisis and the spread of dangerous disease, and made many Palestinians wonder if they had a future in the territory. A cease-fire came into effect on Jan. 19, but it remains unclear how long it will hold.Israel responded by going to war against Hamas in Gaza with Mr. Deif and the other Hamas leaders in its cross hairs. In March, Israel killed his top deputy, Marwan Issa.In November, the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for Mr. Deif’s arrest, accusing him of war crimes and crimes against humanity in connection with his role before, during and after the October 2023 attack.ImageIsraeli soldiers inspecting the bodies of victims of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in the village of Kfar Azza, Israel.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesThe move had been seen as largely symbolic, with a slim likelihood of Mr. Deif’s ending up in custody. He had spent decades underground in Hamas’s tunnels under Gaza, according to Israeli intelligence officials, and had not been seen publicly in years.The court also issued arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant.Recently, senior Israeli defense officials said the military believed that Mr. Deif had developed health problems that forced him to spend more time above ground.That is apparently where an Israeli airstrike found him on July 13.An Israeli unit that oversees the identification of high-value targets, staffed by operatives from military intelligence and the Shin Bet, had spent weeks observing a villa inside the southern Gaza humanitarian zone where another top Hamas lieutenant — Rafa Salameh — was believed to be staying with his family, according to the defense officials.After learning that Mr. Deif appeared to be at the villa, the Israeli government authorized fighter jets to drop at least five precision-guided bombs on it, according to the officials.That evening, Mr. Netanyahu said that an airstrike had targeted Mr. Deif but that there was not yet “absolute clarity” over his fate.“His hands are steeped in the blood of many Israelis,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “At the beginning of the campaign, I laid down a rule: The Hamas murderers are dead men, from the first to the last.”Zakaria Zubeidi, a Palestinian militant who briefly escaped an Israeli prison in 2021, is among those released.ImageZakaria Zubeidi, at center right, arrived in city of Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Thursday.Credit...Alaa Badarneh/EPA, via ShutterstockAmong the Palestinians released on Thursday in a hostage-for-prisoner swap between Israel and Hamas was Zakaria Zubeidi, who over the past two decades has been a militant, a theater director and an escaped prisoner whose flight stunned Israelis and Palestinians alike.Mr. Zubeidi, 49, rose to prominence as a militant leader during the Second Intifada, or uprising, in the early 2000s, during which Palestinian militants committed deadly attacks against Israelis, including suicide bombings that targeted civilian thoroughfares.Israel responded by reoccupying major Palestinian cities amid street battles. Some of the toughest fighting took place in the Palestinian city of Jenin, Mr. Zubeidi’s hometown. His mother and one of his brothers were killed during the clashes.He later emerged as a top commander in the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, an armed militia loosely linked with the secular Fatah party, the dominant Palestinian political faction in the West Bank. On at least one occasion, Mr. Zubeidi publicly announced that the group had conducted armed attacks against Israelis.After the Second Intifada, Israel granted sweeping amnesty to militants affiliated with Fatah; the party now controls the Palestinian Authority, with which Israel coordinates closely on security in the West Bank.Mr. Zubeidi later turned to theater, which he said was a more effective means of resistance than violence. He helped direct the Freedom Theater, a community cultural center in the hardscrabble Jenin refugee camp, which was founded by Palestinians displaced by the 1948 wars surrounding Israel’s establishment.“I don’t miss weapons,” Mr. Zubeidi said in an interview with Israeli television several years ago. “I miss the intifada, the revolution.”But in 2019, Israel arrested him again on charges that he had returned to militancy, accusing him of involvement in recent West Bank violence.Two years later, Mr. Zubeidi and five other Palestinian prisoners conducted a jailbreak by crawling nearly 32 yards through an underground tunnel outside one of Israel’s maximum-security prisons.ImageZakaria Zubeidi, a Palestinian militant who rose to prominence during the Second Intifada, near Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Thursday.Credit...Ali Sawafta/ReutersAlthough they were later recaptured, the prison break shook Israelis and thrilled Palestinians. Israelis saw Mr. Zubeidi’s escape as a chilling security breach with the potential to incite further violence. Many Palestinians called it a temporary victory against Israel’s mass incarceration of Palestinians.An Israeli drone strike killed Mr. Zubeidi’s son, Mohammad, in September. The Israeli military called the son a “significant terrorist” and said he had been involved in shooting at Israeli troops.Other militants convicted of involvement in deadly attacks against Israelis were also among the Palestinians being released on Thursday.One was Sami Jaradat, 56, who was serving multiple life sentences for involvement in a deadly 2003 suicide bombing that targeted a restaurant in Haifa, on the Israeli coast. Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militant group, claimed responsibility for the attack.At least 21 people were killed in the bombing, according to the Israeli authorities, including women, children and a one-year-old girl.Mr. Jaradat, like many Palestinian detainees involved in the deadliest attacks against Israelis, will not be allowed to return to his home near Jenin. Under the terms of the deal, he will be expelled to either the Gaza Strip or another country like Egypt.Unlike Mr. Jaradat, Mr. Zubeidi is expected to remain in the West Bank.On Thursday, Mr. Zubeidi’s wife, Alaa, 39, stood with her sisters and friends in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, dressed in black, to wait for him to be released from prison.She said she had been in mourning since her son Mohammad’s death, visiting his grave daily until mid-December, when Palestinian security forces began operating in the Jenin refugee camp.Fatima AbdulKarim contributed reporting.The release in Khan Younis descended into chaos.ImageA large crowd of people trying to catch a glimpse of the handover of hostage Arbel Yehoud in Khan Younis on Thursday.Credit...Jehad Alshrafi/Associated PressThe release of hostages in southern Gaza on Thursday descended into chaos and disorder as Palestinian militants struggled to control a large crowd of people trying to catch a glimpse of the handover.The scene in the southern city of Khan Younis was in stark contrast to the handover of an Israeli soldier in the morning in the north. While both were performative stunts meant to show Hamas maintained popular support and was very much in control in Gaza, the one in the north went relatively smoothly.Hamas said in a statement that the crowds at the handovers showed how Palestinians were determined to remain on their land. But to Israelis, the chaos in Khan Younis illustrated Hamas’s desire to humiliate and torment the hostages even as they were being freed. In each of the four handovers since the cease-fire came into effect, militants have driven hostages through crowds before transferring them to the Red Cross.On Thursday, when a white van, apparently carrying a hostage or hostages, arrived near the home of Hamas’s former top leader, the militants failed to stop people from surrounding the vehicle. Minutes later, Arbel Yehud, 29, one of the last female hostages in Gaza, was marched to a Red Cross vehicle, as people stretched out their arms in an attempt to take images of her.Ms. Yehud, surrounded by militants from four different groups, was visibly frightened as she walked slowly toward the Red Cross vehicle. At one point, Ms. Yehud seemed to lower her head and close her eyes.In a separate video, Gadi Moses, an 80-year-old hostage, could be seen escorted by militants through the crowd.Yves Daccord, a former director general of the Red Cross, said the handover in Khan Younis was “risky,” “unacceptable,” and “absolutely psychological torture.”“Releasing hostages in this way creates an enormous trauma on top of everything that has already happened,” he said in an interview. Hostages, Mr. Daccord said, should ideally be released away from crowds and cameras.In total, seven Israeli and Thai hostages were transferred to the Red Cross in Khan Younis on Thursday. All of them were abducted during the Hamas-led October 2023 attack on southern Israel that left roughly 1,200 people dead.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel blasted what he described as “shocking scenes” and called on mediators to ensure they don’t happen again.“This is additional proof of the inconceivable brutality of the Hamas terrorist organization.” he said.In a statement, Hamas asserted its military wing was participating in “organized handover operations.”Hamas has claimed it has treated hostages well. Former hostages, however, have reported being abused, including one who spoke publicly about being sexually assaulted and tortured.Hamas just announced that Muhammad Deif, the leader of its military wing, was killed in an Israeli airstrike last year. Abu Obeida, the spokesman for the military wing, confirmed Deif’s death in a video statement after months in which Hamas officials had mostly been silent as to his fate. Israel had announced Deif’s death a couple of weeks after it targeted him in an airstrike that killed and injured dozens of Palestinians.Throughout the war, Hamas rarely confirmed the deaths of its senior military commanders or even of rank-and-file fighters. That changed after the cease-fire came into effect. On Thursday night, Obeida formally announced not only the death of Deif, but also those of other senior Hamas military leaders. Last week, Hamas also held a public funeral for Rawhi Mushtaha, a high-ranking Hamas leader in Gaza.The Israeli prison authority just said that all 110 Palestinian prisoners slated to be freed in the current hostage-for-prisoner swap had been released. The release had been delayed for a few hours after a chaotic handover of Israeli and Thai hostages in Gaza prompted Israeli ire.ImageCredit...Hatem Khaled/ReutersImageCredit...Mahmoud Illean/Associated PressThe release of the Palestinian prisoners concluded the third exchange in the fragile six-week initial cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. On Saturday, Hamas is expected to release three more living male hostages in exchange for Palestinians jailed by Israel as the truce continues.Red Cross buses carrying Palestinian prisoners freed in the exchange have arrived in Beitunia in the occupied West Bank, according to footage live-streamed on Arabic television networks. There was no immediate comment by the Israeli authorities.Palestinians hurled stones at Israeli forces who fired stun grenades in response, near Beitunia in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. That was around the same time the buses carrying Palestinian prisoners freed in the hostage-for-prisoner swap entered the town. It was unclear whether anyone was hurt.VideoCreditCredit...ReutersAgam Berger, the Israeli lookout soldier released from captivity on Thursday morning, arrived in “good” condition, according to Dr. Eytan Wirtheim, the C.E.O. of Beilinson Hospital, where Berger was taken. The four other lookout soldiers who were released on Saturday were “improving from day to day,” Dr. Wirtheim said in a televised statement, adding that they had decided to stay in the hospital to keep Berger company during her first days of freedom.Israelis gathered outside Sheba Hospital to welcome Arbel Yehud in the city of Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv, on Thursday. VideoCreditCredit...Avishag Shaar-YashuvThe family of Arbel Yehud said after her release, “Our life’s mission to bring Arbel back to us has succeeded.” In a statement posted by the Hostage Families Forum, an umbrella organization representing the families of Israeli hostages, the family urged officials to pursue the cease-fire agreement until all hostages, including Ms. Yehud’s partner and his brother, are released. “Everyone must be brought home immediately so that we can heal as a society,” her family said.The five released Thai hostages have undergone initial medical examinations and were found to be in “good” condition, a spokesman for Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said in a statement. Thailand’s foreign minister, Maris Sangiampongsa, is scheduled to arrive in Israel this weekend, the spokesman said.Six of the released hostages — Gadi Moses and the five Thais — have left the initial reception point near the Gaza border on helicopters headed toward hospitals in Israel, the Israeli military said. The Thais will be welcomed there by representatives of Thailand’s government, the military said. Another hostage released today, Arbel Yehud, will be flown to a hospital together with her family soon, according to the military.ImageCredit...Itai Ron/ReutersThe Israeli government said that mediators had guaranteed that hostages in the coming exchanges would be given safe passage, averting chaotic scenes like those earlier today in Gaza. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, had demanded the commitment today in exchange for releasing the 110 Palestinian prisoners as stipulated by the cease-fire agreement with Hamas, according to a statement by Mr. Netanyahu’s office.A faraway vigil for hostages ends in happy tears in ThailandImageWiwwaeo Sriaoun, the mother of Watchara Sriaoun, who was released after 15 months of captivity in Gaza, at her house with another relative in Thailand’s Udon Thani Province on Thursday.Credit...Napat Wesshasartar/ReutersVilas Thanna, the father of Pongsak Thanna, a Thai fruit farmhand who was held hostage in Gaza, could barely get the words out as he digested the news of his son’s release after 15 months of captivity.“When we are happy, we cry,” he said. “When we are sad, we also cry. But these are happy tears.”Mr. Pongsak was among five Thai hostages who were released on Thursday. Working on farms in often dangerous parts of Israel, Thai farmhands suffered a heavy toll in the Hamas-led attacks of Oct. 7, 2023. At least 39 were killed, and at least 31 were taken hostage, according to an earlier tally from the Thai foreign ministry.In November 2023, 23 of those hostages were released. Two more died in captivity, the Thai foreign ministry said last May. (On Thursday evening, a Thai foreign ministry official said that the total fatalities were 46, but it was not clear whether that number referred only to the Oct. 7 attacks.)The hostages released on Thursday were Mr. Pongsak, Sathian Suwannakham, Watchara Sriaoun, Bannawat Seathao and Surasak Lamnao​. The fate of one remaining Thai hostage, Nattapong Pinta, is not clear.Mr. Vilas, Mr. Pongsak’s father, said he planned to go to Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, to meet the plane carrying his son, although costs can be prohibitive.Thai hostages in a previous round of releases in November 2023 said they had to initially pay for their flights from Bangkok back to their home provinces. Thai labor officials say they have since disbursed funds to returned workers.Economic hardship has spurred thousands of Thais, particularly from the Isaan region of northeastern Thailand, to take agricultural jobs in Israel, despite the risks. Besides those who lost their lives in the Oct. 7 killing attack, other Thai farmworkers have been killed over the years in rocket attacks on Israel, including in October.But the money earned in Israel can be life-changing, and villages in Isaan are dotted with modern houses built from these overseas earnings. Some workers who suffered through the Oct. 7 attacks have since gone back to Israel to finish out their contracts.Wiwwaeo Sriaoun, the mother of Mr. Watchara, another of the five Thais released on Thursday, was gathered at home with a gaggle of relatives when she heard of his return.She, too, spoke of tears of joy. As her family cheered around her, Ms. Wiwwaeo’s voice rose to an excited yell.“I hope he can come home safely,” she said.But she was not sure whether she could afford to go to Bangkok to meet her son.For now, she said, she was happy to see her son’s name on the TV screen among those who were finally free.Qadura Fares, the Palestinian prisoners’ affairs commissioner, said in a text message the Palestinian prisoners were now slated to be released around 5 p.m. local time (10 a.m. Eastern). There was no immediate comment by the Israeli authorities.The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said the release of the Palestinian prisoners was being delayed after the chaotic release of Israeli and Thai hostages in southern Gaza, where they were escorted through a surging crowd by armed Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants. Mr. Netanyahu said Israel would not release the Palestinian prisoners until it had received a commitment for “the safe exit of our hostages in the next rounds.”The release of over 100 Palestinian prisoners slated for today has been suspended until further notice, according to Zivan Frieden, a spokesman for Israel’s prisons authority. The decision to suspend the release of Palestinian prisoners was made by Israel’s government, he said in a text message.Israeli officials have expressed outrage at the way that Hamas and Islamic Jihad handed hostages over to the Red Cross in the southern city of Khan Younis, with hundreds of people crowding the area. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the scenes as “shocking.”Nattapong Pinta was not among the five Thai hostages released today. It is unclear whether he is still alive.Before the release of the five Thai hostages, the Israeli authorities had said that eight Thai hostages were in Gaza, though two were declared dead last May. Mr. Nattapong had not been declared dead.Here’s a closer look at the 3 Israeli hostages released today.ImageIsraelis gathered to watch the release of the hostages from what is known as “Hostage Square” in Tel Aviv on Thursday.Credit...Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York TimesHamas released eight hostages, including three Israelis and five Thais, on Thursday as part of a hostage-for-prisoner exchange, more than a year after they were taken captive during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.Agam Berger, an Israeli army soldier, was released first in a highly choreographed ceremony in northern Gaza. A second hostage release in southern Gaza descended into chaos as crowds pushed forward to try to get a glimpse of them.The hostage release is part of a 42-day cease-fire deal that went into effect this month, pausing the fighting between Israel and Hamas. Hamas agreed to incrementally release 33 of the nearly 100 remaining hostages in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinians jailed by Israel and a partial Israeli withdrawal.Here’s a closer look at the Israelis released on Thursday.Agam BergerImageAgam Berger before being handed over to Red Cross representatives in Jabaliya, Gaza, on Thursday.Credit...Mohammed Saber/EPA, via ShutterstockMs. Berger was 19 and recently assigned as a lookout when Hamas-led militants stormed the Nahal Oz army base where she was working, killing more than 50 soldiers and abducting her and six other soldiers. Four of them were earlier released in an exchange on Saturday.Ms. Berger’s mother, Meirav, said she last saw her daughter when they dropped her off at the base on Oct. 5, 2023, two days before the attack. According to a website created by her family, and her parents’ accounts in Israeli news media, Ms. Berger called her parents in the middle of the attack, using the phone of a friend who was killed next to her. She told them that she could hear shots being fired and that people were crying, but that she was not afraid, according to the website.In November 2023, Agam Goldstein-Almog, who was taken captive with her daughter and two sons and was released as part of the first cease-fire deal, said that she had been held in a tunnel with Ms. Berger and the other soldiers serving as lookouts who had been captured. She said that Ms. Berger was praying a lot, and seemed to be in good spirits.In August, Ms. Berger’s family held an event to mark her birthday at Tel Aviv’s Anu Museum of the Jewish People, centered on music because she is passionate about music and plays the violin. She has a twin sister and two other siblings.Gadi MosesImageGadi Moses being escorted by Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters as he is handed over to the Red Cross in Khan Yunis, Gaza, on Thursday.Credit...Jehad Alshrafi/Associated PressGadi Moses, a farming expert, was abducted in Kibbutz Nir Oz after stepping out of a safe room to trying to reason with the militants.His partner, Efrat Katz, hid inside a safe room in their home with her daughter and two visiting grandchildren, before they were also taken by militants. Their kidnapping was captured on video that showed them squashed in the back of a pickup truck.Ms. Katz was killed when an Israeli helicopter, responding to the Hamas-led assault, fired on the vehicle in which she was being held. Her daughter and grandchildren were released during the November 2023 cease-fire.Mr. Moses, then 79, was seen in December of 2023 in a video released by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, calling on Israel to work for his release. The family said in September that they had had no word of his fate since.Arbel YehudImageArbel Yehud in Khan Yunis on Thursday.Credit...Haitham Imad/EPA, via ShutterstockArbel Yehud was 28 when she was taken hostage along with her boyfriend, Ariel Cunio, from their home on Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel. Mr. Cunio is believed to still be held captive. Her brother, Dolev Yehud, a medic, was thought to be a hostage as well but was identified last year as having been killed during the Oct. 7 attack.Ms. Yehud’s family has described her as passionate about space and astronomy and said she had worked as a guide at a space and technology center.In February, her father, Yechi Yehud, told The Daily Mail that he had been avoiding watching or reading any news so as not to raise his hopes for a deal. Her mother, Yael Yehud, described herself as “broken” and said she often imagined her children walking through the door again.On Ms. Yehud’s 29th birthday in June, her close friend, Shani Goren, who had been a hostage and was released in the first cease-fire deal, spoke at a rally in Tel Aviv and described the difficulty of recovering.“Every day I wake up, I’m still held hostage,” she said. “Because until Arbel and everyone else return home, we can’t even begin to discuss rehabilitation and moving forward. I know. I was there.”Ms. Yehud had been expected to be released on Saturday, prompting one of the most significant disputes between Israel and Hamas since the start of the cease-fire.Israeli officials had said they believed she was not being held by Hamas, and had suggested that another militant group was responsible for the holdup in her release. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad on Monday released a video, which an analysis by The New York Times dates to Jan. 25, in which she says, “My family, I’m OK. I miss you endlessly and I hope to return to you soon, like the girls who had been released.”Rights groups and international law experts have noted that, by definition, such hostage videos are made under duress, and that the statements in them are usually coerced.Wiwwaeo Sriaoun, the mother of Watchara Sriaoun, a Thai hostage who was just released, said: “I’m so, so happy. I was tearing up earlier.” As she said this, there were cheers in the home, and her voice rose to an excited yell. “I hope he will come home safely,” she said. She said she hadn’t heard from any Thai or Israeli officials, but saw her son’s name on the TV screen.ImageCredit...Lillian Suwanrumpha/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe Israeli government confirmed that Arbel Yahud and Gadi Moses were back in Israeli custody after over a year in Hamas captivity in Gaza.​The Israeli prime minister's office ​also identifie​d the five Thai hostages released ​t​oday: Pongsak Thanna, Sathian Suwannakham, Watchara Sriaoun, Bannawat Seathao and Surasak Lamnao​.All seven have crossed into Israeli territory, according to the Israeli military.

At one point, Ms. Yehud appeared to be afraid of the people pressing toward her as she slowly walked toward a Red Cross vehicle.In increasingly chaotic scenes, ​a small white van surrounded by armed gunmen​, apparently carrying the hostages​, slowly pushed its way through a large, seething crowd in Khan Younis.​ The van then went inside a partly ruined structure.A ​short while later, a small group of Palestinian gunmen marched through the crowd​ — apparently escorting the hostages — as large numbers of Gazans mobbed them, seeking any glimpse of the ​soon-to-be-freed captives​.VideoCreditCredit...ReutersThis handover is in stark contrast to the one that took place in northern Gaza this morning, which was highly choreographed and controlled.In Thailand, an anxious vigil continues for hostages half a world away.ImageWiwwaeo Sriaoun, the mother of Watchara Sriaoun, one of the Thai hostages in Gaza, watching the news at home in Udon Thani Province, Thailand, on Thursday.Credit...Lillian Suwanrumpha/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIn the impoverished villages of Isaan, as Thailand’s northeast is known, families have become used to a vigil from half a world away.On Thursday, five families hoped that their loved ones were finally being released from Gaza, after 15 months as hostages in a conflict whose contours they do not fully understand. The Thai foreign ministry has said that five Thai nationals will be among those released on Thursday.“Is there any news yet?” asked Wiwwaeo Sriaoun, the mother of Watchara Sriaoun, one of the remaining Thai hostages. “We are happy but also anxious waiting for the names to come out.”Neither Israel nor Hamas have named the Thai hostages due to be released on Thursday.Like the other 30,000 Thai farmworkers laboring in Israel before the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, Mr. Watchara had grown accustomed to nurturing produce in what sometimes turned into a battle zone, his mother said.At least 39 Thai agricultural workers were killed in the Oct. 7 attacks, and at least 31 were taken hostage, according to the Thai foreign ministry. Of the 31 hostages, at least two died in captivity, Thai officials said. During a cease-fire in November 2023, 23 Thai hostages were released.Vilas Thanna, the father of Pongsak Thanna, another Thai hostage, said he hoped that his son, a fruit tender, might be one of the five to be released on Thursday. The family, including Mr. Pongsak’s 14-year-old daughter and many other relatives, had gathered in an excited throng at his home in Buriram, in Isaan.“I am very super duper happy, so excited,” Mr. Vilas said. “I couldn’t sleep since last night.”The fate of the sixth Thai hostage believed to be in Gaza is unclear. While Thai government officials have said he is alive, Thai and Israeli workers charged with taking care of the released hostages say they have been told he has died.Despite the dangers, Thai farmhands have continued to tend fields in Israel. Among them are some who suffered through the Hamas-led killing spree 15 months ago.In October, four Thais were killed by Hezbollah rockets in northern Israel. The same month, another Thai was killed near the Israel-Lebanon border when unexploded ordnance detonated in an orchard.",
