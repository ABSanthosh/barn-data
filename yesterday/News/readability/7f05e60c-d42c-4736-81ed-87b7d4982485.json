So he recorded the snow plow or plows on his Ring door bell camera between 3:08 a.m. and 3:13 a.m.“When I looked out the window I was surprised to see snow plows going at least 40-45 miles per hour,” Bellucci said. Lee’s Summit parents react to the possibility of school in June It’s unclear exactly how fast the driver on West 85th street was going as he passed on Bellucci’s side of the four lane Kansas City maintained street three times and his neighbors across the street twice. Each time snow trails covered as far as the camera could see on the 35 mile per hour street. However, according to the city, all snow plow operators must adhere to a strict speed limit of 20–25 mph, a guideline consistently reinforced before each shift.“They were doing their job. Were they doing it as well as they could, I don’t know? Were they going too fast? Absolutely they were going too fast!” Bellucci exclaimed.The City reports each October, Public Works conducts comprehensive snowplow driver  providing hands-on experience maneuvering through city streets, managing different weather conditions, and effectively utilizing the internal plow tracking system.That map Thursday showed snow plow drivers had been on a large number of the city’s 6,400 lane miles in the past 0-4 hours shown in green and 4 to 8 hours in yellow.But Bellucci questions how effective snow plowing can be, when it looks like the video he recorded.“Those blades can’t be close to the asphalt. They’ve got to be up some to be going that fast and what happens if there’s an accident?” he said.
