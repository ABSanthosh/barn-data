In the recording, which Hezbollah said was made during a military manoeuvre, Nasrallah urged his fighters to defend their nation. \"We count on you... to defend your people, your families, your nation, your values and your dignity, and to defend this holy and blessed land and this honourable people,\" Nasrallah said, according to AFP news agency.He was killed on September 27.Meanwhile, tensions between Israel and Hezbollah continue to escalate. A drone attack in northern Israel on Sunday injured at least 20 people in the town of Binyamina, N12 News reported. The head of Israel’s ambulance service said five of the victims were seriously hurt.In response to ongoing missile attacks from Iran, the United States announced it will send an advanced anti-missile system to Israel, along with US troops to operate it, aiming to strengthen Israel’s air defences.The situation in southern Lebanon also remains tense. UN peacekeepers reported that Israeli tanks \"forcibly entered\" one of their positions on Sunday, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling for the peacekeepers to withdraw.In a show of solidarity, the UAE launched its \"UAE Stands with Lebanon\" campaign, preparing 200 tonnes of aid in 10,000 relief packages to support Lebanon during its current humanitarian crisis.
