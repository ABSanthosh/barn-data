  "text": "Leonardo RochaBBC World Service Latin America editorEPAMasked protesters clash with law enforcement officers in Valle de Agua Abajo, Bocas del ToroPanama has declared an emergency in its main banana-producing region, after shops were looted and buildings vandalised in ongoing protests over a pension reform. The government says constitutional rights will be suspended for the next five days in the north-western Bocas del Toro province. The measure restricts freedom of movement and allows the police to make arrests without a warrant. Troubles in the region began a month ago, when the local banana workers union joined a nationwide protest against proposed pension cuts and declared a strike.\"In the face of the disruption of order and acts of systematic violence, the state will enforce its constitutional mandate to guarantee peace,\" said Juan Carlos Orillac, minister of the presidency.The measure, he added, would allow to \"rescue the province\" from radicals.Protests across the Latin American nation erupted back in March over the pension reform. In Bocas del Toro, the unrest has been largely led by workers at a Chiquita Brands banana plantation. The confrontation escalated last month after the company sacked thousands of striking employees.Protesters have been setting up roadblocks in the province, often clashing with police.Earlier this week, crowds damaged one of Chiquita Brands' facilities as well as a local airport.",
