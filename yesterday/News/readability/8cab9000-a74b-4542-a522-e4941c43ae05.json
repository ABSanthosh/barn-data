  "text": "Georgia-Florida game turns violent (Video credit: Ohio’s Tate's X account)A disturbing incident occurred during the Georgia-Florida college football match at EverBank Stadium on Saturday, when two police officers were seen repeatedly striking different supporters in the stands.A 15-second video shared on X showed one officer delivering three strikes to a supporter already down, whilst another officer struck a different supporter at least seven times before forcing him onto the concrete. A third officer visible in the footage remained uninvolved in any physical altercation.A bystander was heard expressing shock, shouting \"Why are you punching him?\" as one officer continued striking the supporter repeatedly.The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office responded on X on Saturday, saying, \"The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office's Professional Standards Division is aware of the videos circulating from the Georgia-Florida football game. Administrative reviews of the incidents are being opened. As such, the agency will not comment until all facts are known and the reviews have been completed.\"Whilst spectator altercations have occurred at various sporting events this year, including incidents at MetLife Stadium and State Farm Stadium, this situation stood out due to law enforcement involvement.The incident occurred with just over 11 minutes left in the fourth quarter of this annual rivalry match, traditionally held in Jacksonville as a neutral venue, known as \"The World's Largest Cocktail Party.\"Despite Georgia's No 2 AP ranking, Florida led 13-6 at halftime, capitalising on two interceptions thrown by Bulldogs quarterback Carson Beck.Georgia dominated the second half, scoring 28 points in the final 30 minutes. They secured victory with a seven-play, 75-yard touchdown drive with four minutes remaining.The match concluded with Aidan Warner's interception for Florida, followed by Dwight Phillips Jr.'s four-yard touchdown run for Georgia, establishing a two-possession advantage.Georgia's next fixture is against No 19 Ole Miss, whilst Florida faces No. 6 Texas in Austin on Saturday.",
