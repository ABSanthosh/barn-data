  "text": "37-year-old Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger who shot himself in the head before his Tesla Cybertruck exploded in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas was a big supporter of Donald Trump and voted for him in November, his uncle Dean Livelsberger told the Independent. As Livelsberger chose a spot linked to President-elec Donald Trump and a car manufactured by Trump's aide Elon Musk, the FBI is not dismissing any political motivation but the report claimed that, if anything, the bomber was a fan of Trump -- and a registered Republican. Livelsberger was a Rambo-type., 100 per cent patriot, his uncle who was also in the Army said. “He used to have all patriotic stuff on Facebook, he was 100 percent loving the country,” Dean said. “He loved Trump, and he was always a very, very patriotic soldier, a patriotic American. It’s one of the reasons he was in Special Forces for so many years. It wasn’t just one tour of duty.”'Matt was a supersoldier, could have made sophisticated explosives'When Dean Livelsberger was interviewed, he was aware of the Las Vegas explosion but not of his nephew's connection with this. He was bewildered and said it did not make any sense that a skilled warrior and a patriot like Matt would cause an explosion like this -- an amateurish construction. “Matt was a very skilled warrior, and he would be able to make — if it was him, and if he did this — he would’ve been able to make a more sophisticated explosive than using propane tanks and camping fuel. He was what you might call a ‘supersoldier.’ If you ever read about the things he was awarded, and the experience he had, some of it doesn’t make sense, when he had the skills and ability to make something more, let’s say, ‘efficient.’ His skills were enormous from what he had been taught in the military.”Did the gunshot cause the explosion?Several questions remain unanswered as new details emerge in the case that Matthew Livelsberger shot himself in his head before the explosion. The explosion occurred immediately after the suicide. His motive is not clear. It is not confirmed whether he wanted to end his life and the explosion was an accident after the shooting. Livelsberger’s military ID and passport were found inside the Cybertruck, as well as a Desert Eagle .50 caliber semi-automatic pistol and an SLR Rifleworks B30. Both weapons, and Livelsberger himself, were burnt almost beyond recognition, police said. Investigators also recovered a cache of fireworks, along with an iPhone, a smartwatch, and several credit cards in Livelsberger’s name.The firearms were legally purchased on December 30. 'Everyone thought the world of Matt'His uncle said Livelsberger was not estranged from his family and he just had a newborn with his partner. Livelsberger divorced his first wife several years ago who now lives in South Florida with her new husband. Livelsberger has a new partner and the two have a child.
