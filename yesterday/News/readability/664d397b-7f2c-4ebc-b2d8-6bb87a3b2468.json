  "text": "OTTAWA — In 2012, when Mark Carney left Canada to helm the Bank of England, he said he was going to where “the challenges are greatest.” Those now facing him as Canada’s prime minister are significant.The five-week campaign and electoral map revealed a country with two dominant parties with starkly different agendas — and regional divisions that could test national unity as Canada confronts President Donald Trump’s trade war and annexation threats.Carney, a former central banker, overcame a 20-plus-point polling deficit and rescued the Liberals from electoral annihilation, giving them a rare fourth consecutive term. He argued that his experience navigating economic tumult made him the crisis manager Canada needs at a turbulent time.But the results showed anxieties here go beyond Trump. Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre focused his campaign on long-standing concerns about the spiraling cost of living, picking up dozens more seats in key battlegrounds, even if he lost his own.Addressing both concerns will be a critical test of Carney’s government.A deepening political divideThe popular vote has no bearing on the results, but it showed the emergence of a two-party system — at least for now — in a country with a multiparty parliamentary system. For the first time since 1930, the Conservatives and Liberals each won more than 40 percent of the vote. The left-leaning New Democrats collapsed. The sovereigntist Bloc Québécois was diminished.“Millions of our fellow citizens preferred a different outcome,” Carney said in his victory speech. “My message to Canadians is this: No matter where you live, no matter what language you speak, no matter how you voted, I will always do my best to represent everyone who calls Canada home.”The Liberals won or were leading in 169 seats in the House of Commons, just shy of the 172 needed for a majority. The Conservatives trailed, with 144 seats. The New Democrats were projected to win 7 seats — down from 25 in the 2021 election.The Liberals were poised to win a minority government, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. projected, leaving them reliant on the support of smaller parties to pass their agenda and stay in power. Analysts said they expected Carney would get the backing, at least initially.“I’m sure that there will be some degree of cooperation,” said Robert Gillezeau, an associate professor of economic analysis and policy at the University of Toronto. But it won’t be “as smooth” as it’s been in the past, he added.The Trump troublesOne of Carney’s toughest challenges will be handling Trump, who has questioned Canada’s viability as a country. The prime minister has declared the traditional U.S.-Canada relationship “over” and pledged to fight back with targeted retaliatory tariffs and to act with “purpose and force.”He has said that he will seek a new security and trade relationship with the United States, Canada’s largest trading partner, but that he will also look to diversify trade and seek deeper economic ties with “reliable allies.” Canada sends nearly 80 percent of its exports to the United States.Decoupling the Canadian and U.S. economies has often been contemplated, but it is not easily done.“A lot of people think that we can kind of snap our fingers and diversify our trading relationships,” Gillezeau said. “But even if you were to sign a whole bundle of new free-trade agreements, these are structural changes in the economy that take decades, not years.”The tariffs are weighing on a stagnating economy. The Bank of Canada said this month that a prolonged global trade war could tip Canada’s economy into a “severe” recession that permanently reduces the standard of living. The levies are hitting business and consumer sentiment here.Carney has said that Trump is serious about his 51st state threat, and Canadian officials say the president has raised it and previously uncontroversial cross-border treaties in calls. On Monday, as Canadians headed to the polls, Trump repeated the threat.“[His] gratuitous intervention in the Canadian election yesterday, I thought, was repugnant,” Frank McKenna, a former Canadian ambassador to the U.S., said in an interview with the CBC.Carney and Trump spoke Tuesday, the prime minister’s office said, and the president offered congratulations and to meet in person in the “near future.”“The leaders agreed on the importance of Canada and the United States working together — as independent, sovereign nations — for their mutual betterment,” a Canadian readout said.Domestic fracturesThe Conservatives won several seats in the vote-rich suburbs outside Toronto, where the cost of living is a major issue. Household budgets are being squeezed by high grocery costs. Soaring housing prices and a housing shortage make homeownership a pipe dream for young Canadians.The Liberals were buoyed by a strong showing in Atlantic Canada, Quebec and cities such as Toronto and Vancouver. The Conservatives maintained most of their support in the oil-rich prairie provinces, their traditional stronghold.Before Monday’s vote, politicians in the prairies, who have sought more autonomy from Ottawa, were warning that another Liberal government could stir renewed feelings of alienation and disenchantment there.For the past decade, officials in Alberta and Saskatchewan have argued that they have been taken advantage of by Liberal governments and Canadians in the east who have benefited from their oil and gas sector while imposing policies designed to scuttle it and thumbing their nose at them.Analysts say getting Canada’s crude oil and energy to new markets could help reduce reliance on the U.S. Carney has pledged to make Canada an “energy superpower” and to invest in “clean and conventional energy.” But building new infrastructure such as pipelines has in the past been complicated here because of regulatory processes, the constitutional need to consult with Indigenous people and regional opposition.Alberta Premier Danielle Smith on Tuesday pledged to fend off “future hostile acts from Ottawa.” Last month, she made a list of demands that must be addressed “to avoid an unprecedented national unity crisis.”“A large majority of Albertans are deeply frustrated that the same government that overtly attacked our provincial economy almost unabated for the past 10 years has been returned to government,” she wrote in a post on X.Carney, a former U.N. special envoy on climate, will also be pressed to balance developing Canada’s natural resources with taking action to fight climate change. His predecessor, Justin Trudeau, pledged to do just that — and made no one happy in the process.“That national unity question is going to be a bigger issue for Mark Carney than I think people are assuming,” said Darrell Bricker, chief executive of pollster Ipsos Public Affairs in Toronto. “This is for real.”Carney, who grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, noted in his victory speech that he visited the prairies on several occasions during the campaign, even though it’s “tough out there” for Liberals.“I went there because I intend to govern for all Canadians,” he said.",
