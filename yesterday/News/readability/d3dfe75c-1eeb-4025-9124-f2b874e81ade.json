  "text": "Pope Francis, who in his final year of life developed a special connection with the people of Gaza and especially the enclave’s small Christian community, left its people a parting gift: his popemobile.Before his death last month at the age of 88, Francis directed the Catholic relief organization Caritas to turn the vehicle, which he used during a 2014 visit to the West Bank, into a mobile clinic to treat Palestinian children.Francis approved the initiative, labeled “Vehicle of Hope,” and prayed for its success, according to a November 2024 letter written by a senior Vatican official reviewed by The Washington Post.“With the vehicle, we will be able to reach children who today have no access to health care — children who are injured and malnourished,” said Peter Brune, secretary general of Caritas Sweden, which is supporting the initiative. “This is a concrete, lifesaving intervention at a time when the health system in Gaza has almost completely collapsed.”Brune and Anton Asfar, the secretary general of Caritas Jerusalem, first came up with the idea to use the popemobile last year. Cardinal Anders Arborelius of Sweden, who is a contender to succeed Francis as pontiff, pitched the idea to Francis, Brune said. Francis “responded positively, saying of course, if there’s anything I can do for Gaza, the children in Gaza, please use my popemobile in whatever way you want,” Brune said.A key question is whether Israeli authorities will allow the organization to bring the vehicle into Gaza. Humanitarian organizations say aid has not been allowed into the enclave since March 2. Asfar said he plans to request authorization from COGAT, the Israeli Defense Ministry unit that coordinates civil affairs in the occupied territories.“We are hopeful that the Holy Spirit will enlighten the leaders and will open the gates for this great initiative from Pope Francis,” he said.The popemobile, a Mitsubishi that was one of the many vehicles used to transport the pontiff in public, was a gift from Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas for Francis’s 2014 visit to Bethlehem, the West Bank city that is believed to be the birthplace of Jesus. Francis later gifted the vehicle to the Franciscan order in Jerusalem, which gave Caritas permission to modify it.Francis’s visit to the Holy Land in 2014 was his first as pontiff, and he continued to advocate for interreligious understanding and speak out against violence throughout his papacy.Francis spoke out publicly against Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack against Israel and called for the release of all the hostages. He also strongly criticized the rising human cost of Israel’s military operation in Gaza. He repeatedly urged both sides to reach a ceasefire and issued emotional pleas to protect Palestinian children, calling every child sacred.During the war, he called a church in Gaza nearly every day to check in with those seeking refuge from the fighting.According to Vatican News, Pope Francis called the Holy Family Catholic Church in Gaza nightly since the beginning of the war between Hamas and Israel. (Video: Zoeann Murphy/The Washington Post)Now, as Caritas Jerusalem works to convert the popemobile into a medical vehicle, Brune said he hopes this will show children in Gaza that “the world hasn’t forgotten about you.”The popemobile will be fitted with windows and stocked with equipment to diagnose, examine and treat children, including rapid tests for infections, suture kits, oxygen supply, medicine and vaccines. A driver and doctors will work on the vehicle as it travels around Gaza to help children who are sick or injured, Asfar said, adding that the work could be finished in about 10 days.One element of the vehicle will not change: The seat on which Francis sat will remain, and patients will sit on it when they are examined and treated, Asfar said. The organization hopes this will “convey the love of the Holy Father to the people of Gaza, especially the children,” he said.Asfar said the plan for the popemobile to deliver primary health care in hard-to-reach areas is especially important because “the health system has collapsed in Gaza.” According to the World Health Organization’s latest update in March, only 48 percent of primary health-care centers in the enclave are functional.COGAT told The Post in a statement that it was not familiar with the initiative and that approval for the popemobile to enter Gaza would have to come from the government. The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office did not respond to a request for comment Monday.Brune said Caritas plans to expand the Vehicle of Hope initiative beyond Gaza and convert vehicles into mobile primary health-care clinics in conflict zones around the world.“Gaza was only the start,” he said.",
