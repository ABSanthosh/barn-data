  "text": "Matt Gaetz, the former Florida congressman, became the subject of online jokes about his makeup after appearing on his talk show, The Matt Gaetz Show, New York Post reported. In the second episode, which aired on Friday, Gaetz invited his former colleague George Santos to offer beauty advice. This followed a social media frenzy where many mocked Gaetz for looking like a \"Who from Whoville,\" a reference to the quirky, round-faced characters from Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas.Gaetz asked Santos for help with his makeup, saying, “What’s going on with my makeup? Help me! Give me advice!” Santos, a former drag queen, quickly offered his thoughts. “Let me tell you something, highlighter is not for you,” he said. Santos explained that highlighting the centre of Gaetz's face made his eyes look smaller and didn’t give the right effect. Gaetz tried to defend his makeup, mentioning his deep-set eyes, but Santos disagreed.“Look at the flawlessness in my skin. No highlighter needed!” Santos said. He continued, “You’re a Florida man. I’m in Florida right now. When you’re tan and you’re a Florida man, you don’t need that level of highlighter.” Santos then recommended Gaetz use “Double Wear foundation from Estee Lauder,” an expensive product that costs $52 per ounce.But Gaetz’s makeup isn’t his only issue. He is also involved in a serious sex scandal, facing accusations of trafficking, fraud, and drug use, along with allegations of having sex with a 17-year-old girl. In November, Gaetz announced he was withdrawing as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general. His chances of Senate confirmation were slim due to ongoing investigations into alleged drug use and payments for sex. He submitted his resignation to Congress.",
