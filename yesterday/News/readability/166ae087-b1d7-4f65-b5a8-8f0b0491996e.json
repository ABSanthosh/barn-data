  "text": "We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street’s Radar Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks. Users are adopting artificial intelligence tools at an unprecedented pace. As reported by Reuters, OpenAI weekly active users surged past 400 million in February, reinforcing the observation. The artificial intelligence startup had 300 million weekly active users in December 2024, signifying an increase of 100 million users. Furthermore, the company’s paying business users also crossed 2 million in February, a figure that has more than doubled from its last update in September 2024. READ NOW: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines and 15 AI Stocks Every Investor Should Be Watching With OpenAI boasting its successes despite DeepSeek’s emergence, other tech companies are also joining in the parade. xAI, led by Musk, has recently revealed Grok3, the latest iteration of its chatbot. This innovation is in direct competition with AI models by companies such as OpenAI and DeepSeek. It is being rolled out immediately to Premium+ subscribers on X. xAI is also launching a new subscription tier, SuperGrok. This would be for users accessing the chatbot via its mobile app and Grok.com website. \"Grok-3 across the board is in a league of its own”. Analysts are also pouring in their comments about xAI’s latest innovation. \"The introduction of Grok-3 puts xAI back in the race for leadership in open-source LLMs. It outperforms the current state-of-the-art models on some benchmarks, which makes xAI relevant again”. While Luria did point out xAI’s relevancy in the leadership in open-source LLMs, it was also noted that improvements over the Grok-2 model appear to be too small to justify the enormous resources used to train it. Meanwhile, Anthropic, another AI startup, is doing its best to catch up with firms such as OpenAI. More than a week ago, the company projected that its revenue could reach as high as $34.5 billion in 2027. The report revealed that in a base case scenario, Anthropic's revenue would reach $12 billion in 2027, up from $2.2 billion in 2025. Back in January, Reuters also reported how Anthropic is nearing a deal to raise $2 billion at a price that values the company at $60 billion. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.",
