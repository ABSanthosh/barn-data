  "text": "Getty ImagesThe US has launched a \"decisive and powerful\" wave of air strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen, President Donald Trump has said, citing the armed group's attacks on shipping in the Red Sea as the reason.\"Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at US aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies,\" Trump wrote on his Truth social platform, adding that their \"piracy, violence, and terrorism\" had cost \"billions of dollars\" and put lives at risk.The Houthi-run health ministry said at least 15 people were killed and nine others injured in the strikes.The group - which began targeting shipping in response to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza - said its forces would respond to US strikes.The Houthis reported a series of explosions on Saturday evening in Sanaa and in the northern province of Saada - the rebels' stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia. The Iranian-backed rebel group, which considers Israel its enemy, controls Sanaa and the north-west of Yemen, but it is not the country's internationally-recognised government.Unverified images show plumes of black smoke over the area of Sanaa's airport - which includes a military facility.In a statement, the Houthis blamed the US and the UK for \"wicked\" aggression targeting residential areas in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa - though it is understood that the UK did not participate in Saturday's US strikes against the Houthi targets but it did provide routine refuelling support for the US.These attacks, Trump said, \"will not be tolerated\".He added: \"We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\"The Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.Who are the Houthis and why are they attacking ships?Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.The group has not been deterred by the deployment of Western warships to protect merchant vessels, or by multiple rounds of US and British air strikes on its military targets.Israel has also carried out air strikes against the Houthis since July in retaliation for the 400 missiles and drones that the Israeli military said had been launched at the country from Yemen, most of which were shot down.Major shipping companies have been forced to stop using the Red Sea - through which almost 15% of global seaborne trade usually passes - and use a much longer route around southern Africa instead.Trump said that it had been more than a year since a US-flagged ship had sailed safely through the Suez Canal - which the Red Sea leads to - and four months since a US warship had been through the body of water between east Africa and the Arabian peninsula.The Suez Canal is the quickest sea route between Asia and Europe, and is particularly important in the transportation of oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG).Addressing the Houthis directly, Trump wrote that if they did not stop, \"HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE\".But the Houthis were unwavering in their response, saying the aggression would not wane their support for Palestinians.\"This aggression will not go without response and our Yemeni armed forces are ready to answer escalation with further escalation,\" the group said. Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the Houthi's \"benefactor\", Iran, was \"on notice\".The Houthis launched 190 attacks in the Red Sea between November 2023 and October 2024, according to the US Congress.Previously, the UK and US conducted joint naval and air strikes against the group. Israel has also targeted sites linked to the Houthis in separate strikes.Trump urged Iran to cease its support for the Houthis, warning that Washington would hold Tehran \"fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it\".He also accused the previous White House administration, under Joe Biden, of being \"pathetically weak\" and allowing the \"unrestrained Houthis\" to keep going.",
