  "text": "The Sudanese military recaptured the capital of Khartoum on Wednesday, the military chief announced, a significant victory nearly two years into the civil war that has killed more than 150,000 people and created what international aid groups describe as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.There was no immediate comment from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), but footage posted on social media showed fighters streaming over a bridge and out of the city on foot. The military had recaptured the airport earlier Wednesday, and Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the military chief and de facto head of state, flew into the capital Wednesday, telling journalists in the remains of the war-ravaged presidential palace, “Khartoum is now free.”Footage posted on social media showed the newly recaptured airport — one of the first places targeted by the RSF when war broke out in April 2023 — was almost destroyed, with blackened shells surrounded by ruined planes.“There are people crying out in joy everywhere. I still can’t believe it. Now we can move freely. We can go to any area, and I can return home whenever I want. Before, you only risked your life to go once, and if you survived, you couldn’t return,” said Mohamed Mudather, a member of the city’s civilian-run Emergency Response Room.Mudather said RSF fighters had begun escaping days ago but had completely fled by Tuesday. On Wednesday, a large military force crossed a river and reached his neighborhood.The RSF still has some presence in the south of the city, and across the Nile in Omdurman, residents said. But Wednesday’s push is the culmination of grueling, street-by-street battles for control of the city where the military has clawed back control of strategic locations. Its advance sped up significantly last autumn after the delivery of powerful Turkish drones.Civilians in RSF-held areas have frequently complained of abuses, including looting, torture and executions, and extreme sexual violence. The United States says that both sides have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, which they both deny, and that the RSF has committed genocide. The United Nations and other investigators say the United Arab Emirates has supplied weapons and diplomatic support to the RSF since the beginning of the conflict — although Emirati authorities and the RSF deny the allegations.The RSF still holds significant swaths of the country, including most of the western region of Darfur. On Monday, locals in the town of Tora reported an airstrike that killed dozens of people in a market; footage posted online showed lines of incinerated bodies.The civil war has spilled over Sudan’s borders, sending millions of refugees streaming into neighboring Chad, Ethiopia, South Sudan and Egypt.Oil-rich South Sudan, which won its independence from Sudan in 2011 after decades of civil war, is also sliding into a civil war. The ongoing violence in South Sudan, one of the world’s poorest nations, is fueled by endemic corruption and long-standing rivalry between its president and vice president.Earlier this month, a South Sudanese general and dozens of soldiers were reportedly killed in an attack on a U.N. helicopter, and embassies have shut down or reduced their staffing. Gunfire and explosions were heard in South Sudan’s capital of Juba on Wednesday.",
