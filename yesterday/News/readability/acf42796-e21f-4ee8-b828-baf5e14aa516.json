At least seven other buildings, including a furniture store, shopping center and office building, have collapsed in recent years, with fatal results.“God warned us, but the music and the party didn’t let people hear it,” said Nelson Pimentel, 65, who was at Jet Set with friends from a seniors club. “When the first piece fell with the water, I looked up and saw what looked like repairs. I work in construction, and I can tell you: that construction looked very old.”When the larger piece fell, he said, people had about 15 seconds to run. Ten of his friends did not make it.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
