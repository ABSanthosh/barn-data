  "text": "Because of Mazen al-Hamada, the world can’t say it didn’t know.The 47-year-old Syrian activist, who suffered unimaginable torture in the regime’s brutal prisons, escaped to Europe in 2014. There, he set about telling his story, reliving the horrors he had been subjected to in vivid detail to statesmen, legislatures and anyone who would listen.He bore the scars of his torture physically, including the deep gashes on his wrists from where he had been strung up by chains, and emotionally, in his gaunt, haunted face, becoming a public symbol of the hidden torment being endured out of sight in Syria by tens of thousands of people.Then in 2020, he went back to Syria, telling friends he was convinced it was pointless to continue sharing his torment with a world that didn’t care. He believed he could achieve more by returning to the country, by reasoning with the regime that had cracked down so harshly on a popular uprising, and that he had reassurances from the government of President Bashar al-Assad that he would be safe.Instead, he was detained upon arrival at Damascus International Airport, and disappeared into the prison system once again.On Tuesday, relatives in Damascus identified his body among around 40 corpses found wrapped in bloodied sheets and dumped at the military hospital in the Damascus suburb of Harasta. They appeared to have been freshly killed, perhaps in the last hours before Assad fled and the rebels took over, said Mouaz Moustafa of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, who worked closely with Hamada. Gruesome photos of his body posted online, too gruesome to describe, suggested he died an agonizing death, under torture to the end.The hospital in Harasta is known as a way station for prisoners who are tortured to death, on their way to burial in mass graves, said Stephen Rapp, who chairs the Commission for International Justice and Accountability, a nonprofit that gathers evidence of war crimes in Syria and spent hours recording Hamada’s testimony of torture. He thinks Hamada and the others found with him were hastily killed as the regime fell because they were identified as likely to give evidence against their tormentors.“His death was so new, he hadn’t been processed for burial,” Rapp said.Hamada didn’t live to see the collapse of the dictator whose demise he gave his life for.The joy felt by millions of Syrians at Assad’s departure has been tempered by the realization that most of the estimated 100,000 people who went missing in the gulag of his prison system will probably never return. Human rights groups say they are confident that all of the prisoners held in Syrian jails have been set free, including around 4,000 released from Sednaya, the biggest and most notorious of Syria’s prisons.Fadel Abdul Ghany, executive director of the Syrian Network for Human Rights, broke down in tears as he conveyed the news Tuesday on Syria TV. “Most of the missing people in Syria who were under regime [control] are dead,” he said. “This is the truth.”The vast majority of those had been detained, like Hamada, for their political opposition to Assad, human rights groups say.Hamada had initially been arrested for participating in the peaceful protests that swept Syria in 2011. He spent several short stints in jail before being seized again and taken to the dreaded Air Force Intelligence headquarters in the Mezzeh neighborhood of Damascus, where his real nightmare began.He was suspended from the ceiling by chains for hours. His ribs were broken by guards who jumped on him. His skin was scorched by cigarettes and his body jolted by electric shocks. He was raped with a metal pole and had his genitals placed in a clamp, leaving him impotent for life.These details he recounted on request, to politicians, journalists and academics across the West, becoming a fixture on the human rights advocacy circuit who was guaranteed to move audiences to tears. He would cry every time too, tears welling in his wide eyes and rolling down his bony cheeks.In a clip from the 2017 documentary “Syria’s Disappeared,” by Afshar Films, Mazen al-Hamada details the brutality he endured in Syrian torture chambers. (Video: Afshar Films/'Syria's Disappeared')“Every time he spoke he was forced to relive the horrors. I can still picture the emptiness in his eyes — eyes that seemed to look past the world entirely,” wrote a Syrian friend in the Netherlands, Sakir Khader, in a tribute on X.He appeared, and almost certainly was, deeply traumatized, said Sara Afshar, who made a documentary about the Syrian prison system that prominently featured Hamada and became friends with him in the process. His life and death are testimony to the indifference of the world to the suffering in Syria that continued unchecked until Assad’s fall on Sunday, she said.“He told everything about the absolute horrors that were happening and he did it over and over again, and nobody did anything and now he’s dead and all the others are dead too,” she said. “The things he said happened to him were beyond human understanding they were so monstrous, and yet governments were normalizing with him.”Hamada was meanwhile growing more and more disillusioned with the lack of impact his campaigning had. A surge of interest in Syria after the initial uprising began abated after 2016 when Russian intervention on behalf of Assad appeared to ensure the survival of his regime. He began telling friends he wanted to return to Syria and made several visits to the Syrian embassy in Berlin, where he secured a passport.In one of his last known phone calls, Hamada told a fellow Syrian activist that he was prepared to sacrifice his life to stop the killing from continuing. “We went to America and told them the whole story. We went to the Netherlands, France and even Italy. And people didn’t listen. The whole world didn’t listen,” he said, according to a recording of the phone call provided by the activist, Maysoun Berkdar.Hamada was taken into custody the moment he landed at Damascus airport, said his nephew, Ziad al-Hamada, who spoke with Mazen after he landed. Hamada sounded panicked and told him he was being detained, he said.Many of Hamada’s friends had already assumed he was dead. A Syrian dissident freed from prison in 2022 told Moustafa he had seen Hamada at the Air Force Intelligence prison in Damascus, but from there the sightings went cold.That he had survived all this time under the terrible conditions only to be killed at the very end is one of the hardest things for his friends to bear, Afshar said. But, she said, “he died a hero. I hope everyone remembers that.”",
