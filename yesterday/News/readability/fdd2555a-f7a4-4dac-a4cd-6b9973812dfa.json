  "text": "Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is set to undergo a follow-up medical procedure on Thursday morning, following an emergency surgery earlier this week to address a brain bleed. The announcement came from the Sirio-Libanes Hospital in Sao Paulo, where the 79-year-old leader is currently recuperating.On Tuesday, Lula underwent a two-hour operation to drain blood that had accumulated between his brain and the meningeal membrane, a complication resulting from a fall he experienced at his home in October. According to his personal doctor, Roberto Kalil Filho, Thursday's procedure will involve embolization of the middle meningeal artery, aimed at minimizing the risk of future bleeding. Kalil described this follow-up as \"relatively simple\" and \"low risk,\" with an expected duration of about one hour.In a medical update released on Wednesday, doctors reported that Lula is recovering well. He has been alert, conversing with family members, and even participating in physiotherapy sessions. The hospital confirmed that he remains in intensive care but has shown no complications since the initial surgery. Kalil emphasized that the decision for the additional procedure was made after observing Lula's positive recovery, indicating it does not reflect any deterioration in his health condition.Lula's health concerns have raised alarms given his age and recent medical history. Following his fall on October 19, which resulted in a visible laceration on his head, he had to cancel planned international trips, including attendance at a BRICS summit in Russia. Despite these challenges, Lula has resumed many of his presidential duties since mid-November, participating in significant events such as hosting a G20 summit.",
