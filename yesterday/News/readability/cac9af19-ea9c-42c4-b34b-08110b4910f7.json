  "text": "As the investigation into the causes of death for Gene Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa continues, the possibility of a gas leak inside their home appears to be conclusively ruled out.On Tuesday, the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office issued an update based on the New Mexico Gas Company's \"extensive investigation for gas leaks and carbon monoxide at Gene Hackman's home,\" which was conducted the evening of Feb. 26.\"There were no significant findings. NMGC did issue five (5) red tags. One red tag was for a minuscule leak (0.33% gas in air – not a lethal amount) at one of the stove burners,\" the news release states. \"The other four red tags were for code enforcement violations -not involving gas leaks or carbon monoxide – involving a water heater and gas log lighters installed in three fireplaces.\"These results \"are not believed to be a factor in the deaths of Gene Hackman, Betsy Arakawa or their dog,\" the sheriff's office noted.Nevertheless, the findings were sent to the Office of the Medical Investigator \"for consideration.\"Santa Fe authorities previously ruled out carbon monoxide poisoningIn a press conference last week, the sheriff's department ruled out carbon monoxide poisoning as a potential cause of death for the couple, revealing that tests came back negative.Hackman and Arakawa were found dead alongside their dog by neighborhood security officials in their Santa Fe, New Mexico, home on Feb. 26. Hackman's pacemaker revealed \"his last event was recorded on Feb. 17, 2025,\" the sheriff's office said in a press conference on Friday, adding that it was \"a very good assumption\" to conclude that was Hackman's \"last day of life,\" more than a week before he was found.As Hollywood shared condolences and memories of the Oscar-winning actor, troubling details began to emerge surrounding the couple's deaths.According to a search warrant affidavit, authorities found the actor in a mudroom near his cane, appearing to have fallen, while his wife Arakawa was found in an open bathroom near a space heater, with an open prescription bottle and pills scattered on the nearby countertop. A deputy observed Arakawa with \"body decomposition, bloating in her face\" and mummification of her hands and feet.One of the couple's dogs was also found dead less than 15 feet from Arakawa in a closet, while two other dogs were found alive in the bathroom near Arakawa and outside. Authorities have called the circumstances \"suspicious,\" while noting \"no foul play\" is suspected at this time.Contributing: Anna Kaufman, Taijuan Moorman, USA TODAYThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Gene Hackman death investigation reveals gas, carbon monoxide results",
