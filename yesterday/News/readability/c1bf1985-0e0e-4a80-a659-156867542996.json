  "text": "Two days before their planned visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories, 27 French lawmakers and local officials were informed on Sunday that their entry visas had been revoked. The group, which included members of France's left-wing ecologist and communist parties, said the trip was meant to promote international cooperation and peace, reported news agency AFP.The French consulate in Jerusalem had invited the lawmakers for a five-day official programme. However, Israel’s interior ministry cancelled their visas under a law that allows authorities to bar individuals considered a threat to national interests. Among those banned were national assembly deputies Francois Ruffin, Alexis Corbiere, Julie Ozenne, communist deputy Soumya Bourouaha, and senator Marianne Margate. Other participants included mayors and local elected officials. In a joint statement, they described the move as “collective punishment” and a “major rupture in diplomatic ties.” They urged French president Macron to respond and ensure Israel reversed its decision. The lawmakers also noted that their political parties have long supported Palestinian statehood, which Macron recently appeared to support. He said France may recognise a Palestinian state as early as June during an international summit. This is not an isolated incident. Earlier this month, Israel deported two British MPs at Tel Aviv airport. In February, two left-wing European parliament members were also barred. Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has strongly opposed international moves to recognise Palestinian statehood, calling them a reward for terrorism.",
