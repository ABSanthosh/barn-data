  "text": "JERUSALEM — Fifteen World Food Program trucks carrying aid were looted overnight in Gaza, the U.N. agency said Friday, underscoring the insecurity and desperation more than two months into Israel’s blockade on food, water and aid to the shattered enclave.The trucks were among the trickle of humanitarian supplies that Israel has allowed to enter Gaza in recent days amid mounting international criticism. Ninety trucks carrying flour, baby food and nutritional supplements entered the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, the U.N. humanitarian affairs agency said, the first aid to enter in 80 days. There were 107 trucks on Thursday, according to COGAT, the arm of Israel’s Defense Ministry that coordinates aid in Gaza.Relief workers say the population needs 500 truckloads of aid a day.The relief allowed into Gaza this week “has not scratched the surface of the vast needs,” the International Rescue Committee said Friday. One in five people in the enclave is now at risk of starvation, according to a U.N.-backed assessment.Looters sacked the World Food Program trucks in southern Gaza late Thursday, the agency said in a statement, as the vehicles headed to bakeries there. “Hunger, desperation, and anxiety over whether more food aid is coming, is contributing to rising insecurity,” the agency said. “We need support from the Israeli authorities to get far greater volumes of food assistance into Gaza faster, more consistently, and transported along safer routes.”Israel described the aid blockade, which began March 2, as an attempt to force Hamas militants to surrender and release the 58 hostages, living and dead, still in Gaza. Neither the embargo nor fresh Israeli military operations have induced Hamas to surrender, but they have pushed the enclave’s already bone-tired civilians closer to starvation.U.N. agencies warn that Israel is weaponizing food aid as Gaza faces famine. (Video: Zoeann Murphy/The Washington Post)Sixty people were killed and 175 wounded over the past 24 hours in the enclave, the Gaza Health Ministry said Friday, bringing the death toll there to more than 53,800. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but it said most are women and children. The toll doesn’t include those whose bodies remain trapped under the rubble or were buried by family members without being taken to a hospital or morgue.Israel launched its campaign to eradicate Hamas in response to the militants’ deadly raid on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Hamas-led fighters killed 1,200 people and took 250 more back to the enclave as hostages.In the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood of Gaza City on Friday, 32-year-old Faten Lubbad said her family of 13 was down to the last of its stockpiled dried goods. What food is available is prohibitively expensive.They can’t afford vegetables at the market, Lubbad said by phone. When they ran out of flour, they ground pasta to make bread. When they ran out of pasta, they boiled lentils in water. That was all they had eaten in two days, Lubbad said, speaking on the condition that her family name be withheld out of concern for her safety.“I wait until I sleep to forget about the hunger,” she said. Her weight had plummeted to 93 pounds. “Our situation is like that of most people in Gaza. It’s not just us.”Mirvat, 55, reached by phone in Jabalya, said no one in her immediate family had eaten since her son, Haitham, was wounded in an airstrike Wednesday night as he searched the street stalls for falafel. The Israeli army did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Haitham was in a hospital, his mother said. The family had run out of water, and he walked long distances to collect some.Mirvat felt she was starving now. She felt light-headed and her vision was blurring, she said. Her head and abdomen ached.“We have nothing left. I can’t stand it,” she said. “They say there is aid, but I haven’t seen anything.”Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of the U.N.’s Palestinian refugee agency, said “no one should be surprised” at the reports of looting.“The people of #Gaza have been starved + deprived of the basics including water \u0026 medicines for more than 11 weeks,” he wrote on X. “Mothers and fathers have run out of food for their children. Older people died because of lack of medicines.“The aid going in now is a needle in a haystack. A meaningful \u0026 uninterrupted flow of aid is the only way to prevent the current disaster from spiraling further.”Aid organizations say Israeli authorities have denied most of their requests for better measures to safeguard convoys. U.N. officials, transport workers and truck drivers say Israeli forces within view of looting have failed to intervene.The Israeli military has denied the allegations. It says that it works to facilitate the flow of aid and that its troops have targeted looters.In the aftermath of Hamas’s attack on Israel, the military campaign in Gaza drew widespread support among Israelis. But now that support is dwindling.On Friday, hundreds of peace activists rallied in southern Israel to demand a ceasefire and a hostage deal that would bring home the 23 hostages believed to still be alive and the remains of the rest. They held posters of Palestinian children killed by the Israeli military alongside those of Israeli captives.“There’s no security or comfort in the continuation of the war,” rang out one chant. And another: “You don’t achieve security with the bodies of children.”Levine reported from Sderot, Israel. Berger reported from London. Balousha reported from Hamilton, Ontario.",
