On Sunday, he said the United States should not treat Colombian migrants as criminals.Credit...Raul Arboleda/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesJan. 26, 2025Updated 5:52 p.m. ETColombia refused to accept U.S. military planes deporting immigrants, setting off a furious reaction from President Trump, who on Sunday announced a barrage of tariffs and sanctions targeting the country, which has long been a top U.S. ally in Latin America.The United States will immediately impose a 25 percent tariff on all Colombian imports, and will raise them to 50 percent in one week, Mr. Trump said on social media.The Trump administration will also “fully impose” banking and financial sanctions against Colombia, and will apply a travel ban and revoke visas of Colombian government officials, the president said.Colombia’s leftist president, Gustavo Petro, also hit back at Mr. Trump. In one social media post, he announced retaliatory tariffs of 25 percent on U.S. imports to Colombia and in another, longer post he said those tariffs would hit 50 percent. Directly addressing Mr. Trump, Mr. Petro also questioned whether the American president was trying to topple him. “You don’t like our freedom, fine,” Mr. Petro said. “I do not shake hands with white enslavers.”The feud reflects how Mr. Trump is making an example out of Colombia as countries around the world grapple with how to prepare for the mass deportations of unauthorized immigrants that he has promised.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
