All were noncritical, the department said.The workers reportedly became ill roughly an hour after eating a noodle dish, according to NBC News affiliate WBAL of Baltimore.The Howard County Health Department said it was working with the Maryland Department of Health to investigate the exact cause of the incident but said it was not believed to have been intentional.“Preliminary indications are that the illness was related to outside food prepared by an employee and shared with others at the facility,” the department said.The department is now talking to the affected to learn “more specific details about the food in question.”“At this time, we are not aware of any further illness connected to this incident and believe there is little risk to the larger community,” the department said.All 46 who were hospitalized have been released.The Maryland Health Department reiterated on X it was “not currently aware of any risk of further illnesses connected to this incident.”The incident unfolded at NAFCO Wholesale Seafood Distributors, WBAL reported. Stanley Pearlman Enterprises, the parent company of NAFCO, told the outlet that the food that caused the illness did not come from the facility.“NAFCO operates under the highest health and safety standards in the industry.
