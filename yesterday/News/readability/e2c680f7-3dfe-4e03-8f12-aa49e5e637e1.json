It has now announced a postponement.A steel plant in Duisburg, Germany, on Wednesday. Europe’s planned retaliation was in response to metal-sector tariffs, and those levies appeared to be still in place.Credit...Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesApril 10, 2025Updated 2:02 p.m. ETEuropean Union officials ​announced on Thursday that they would delay plans for retaliatory tariffs after President Trump’s abrupt decision to hit pause on some of the levies he had placed on Europe and much of the rest of the world.Mr. Trump’s announcement, on Wednesday, fell far short of providing total relief to Europe. Higher tariffs are still in place for cars and key metals, and a delay is not a cancellation. Uncertainty is rampant, burdening consumers and companies across the continent.Still, the move did signal what European leaders were hoping for: a possible willingness to negotiate.Washington’s pivot came just hours after European officials had approved retaliatory levies of 10 to 25 percent on about $23 billion of U.S. imports. But given the American shift, E.U. leaders said on Thursday that they would take a 90-day pause of their own.“If negotiations are not satisfactory, our countermeasures will kick in,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, announced in a statement. “Preparatory work on further countermeasures continues.”The Trump administration is specifically pausing what it has called “reciprocal” tariffs — across-the-board taxes that apply in different amounts to different countries. Mr. Trump announced those levies on April 2, saying the European Union would face a levy of 20 percent. With his about-face on Wednesday, the bloc would most likely instead face a 10 percent across-the-board tariff for the next 90 days.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
