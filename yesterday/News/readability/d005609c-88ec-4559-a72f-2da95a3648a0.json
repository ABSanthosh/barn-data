Roybal federal building after their deployment by U.S. President Donald Trump, in response to protests against immigration sweeps, in Los Angeles on June 8, 2025. Mike Blake | ReutersCalifornia National Guard troops arrived in Los Angeles on Sunday morning, hours after President Donald Trump signed an order to deploy 2,000 service members in response to immigration protests in Los Angeles.Trump's order, announced by the White House Saturday night, followed continued clashes between demonstrators and federal agents executing immigration enforcement actions in L.A., which have led to more than 100 arrests. \"In recent days, violent mobs have attacked ICE Officers and Federal Law Enforcement Agents carrying out basic deportation operations in Los Angeles, California,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.Leavitt told NBC News that Trump is federalizing part of California's National Guard that would otherwise report to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Presidents have the authority to do so under limited circumstances.Late Sunday, Newsom said he has requested that the Trump administration return the Guard troops to his command.\"I have formally requested the Trump Administration rescind their unlawful deployment of troops in Los Angeles county and return them to my command,\" the governor wrote in a post on X. \"Rescind the order. Return control to California.\"Earlier, Newsom had slammed Trump's move to federalize the troops, calling it \"purposefully inflammatory\" and said it \"will only escalate tensions.\"\"LA authorities are able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment's notice,\" Newsom wrote on X. \"We are in close coordination with the city and county, and there is currently no unmet need.\"Trump and Newsom spoke on Friday for approximately 40 minutes, a spokesperson confirmed to CNBC.Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Sunday that the deployment of federalized troops \"is a chaotic escalation.\"\"The fear people are feeling in our city right now is very real – it's felt in our communities and within our families and it puts our neighborhoods at risk,\" Bass said in a statement.She urged \"protestors to remain peaceful\" and said that she has been in touch with immigrants rights leaders and local law enforcement.Members of the California National Guard stand guard outside the Edward R.
