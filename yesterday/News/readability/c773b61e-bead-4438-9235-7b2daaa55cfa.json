  "text": "Donald Trump (AP file photo)US president Donald Trump on Friday said he was never informed that his name appeared in files related to Jeffrey Epstein, the late sex offender. Speaking to reporters in Scotland, Trump denied a report by The Wall Street Journal which claimed that the attorney general had briefed him in May. “No, I was never, never briefed, no,” he said.BREAKING: Trump Blasts Reporters To Their Faces For 'Making A Very Big Thing' About Epstein FilesWhen asked about Ghislaine Maxwell’s recent interview, Trump avoided details. “I have nothing to say about it. She is being talked to by a really smart man. I don’t know anything about the conversation,” he said. On the subject of a possible pardon for Maxwell, Trump dismissed it. “A lot of people have been asking about pardon. This is not the time to be talking about pardon,” he said. Trump reiterated what he told reporters before flying to Scotland. “You’re making a very big thing about something that’s not a big thing. You should be talking about former president Bill Clinton, former Harvard president, hedge fund guys, not talking about Trump,” he added. He earlier told reporters, \"I'll give you the list. These guys lived with Jeffrey.”The WSJ report claimed Bondi and her deputy Todd Blanche conveyed to Trump that he was mentioned several times on the documents. Bondi and Blanche issued a joint statement after Journal's report and said they routinely briefed Trumpo about the findings.The Wall Street Journal report came after Trump sued Rupert Murdoch and WSJ after it claimed that Trump wrote a birthday letter to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and that note was not in good taste. Apart from calling the note fake, Trump announced that he sued WSJ and Rupert Murdoch.",
