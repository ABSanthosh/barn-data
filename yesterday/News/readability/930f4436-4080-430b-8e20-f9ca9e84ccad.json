  "text": "Qatar said Saturday that it had paused mediation efforts for a cease-fire deal in the Gaza Strip, announcing in a statement that it would resume its role helping broker an agreement only when the parties, including Israel and Hamas, “show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war and the ongoing suffering of civilians.”Qatari officials notified the two sides 10 days ago, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed bin Mohammed al-Ansari, after a last-ditch effort by the United States to restart negotiations following the death of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar in October.That recent push failed, with Israel and Hamas both sticking to well-entrenched positions that diplomats say are irreconcilable. Hamas, which still holds about 100 Israeli hostages, more than half of whom are believed to be alive, wants a permanent end to the war and the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops. Israel, led by the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, says it will not agree to a long-term truce and instead prefers a temporary pause in fighting during which it would release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the hostages.The move by Qatar to halt its role as a mediator cast further uncertainty over the direction of the war, as well as Gaza’s future, as the region scrambled to make sense of how a second Trump administration could impact the conflict. The statement also came as the Biden administration said it had informed Qatar that Hamas leaders, some of whom live in the capital, were no longer welcome there, an abrupt shift from the long-held U.S. position that kicking Hamas out of the Persian Gulf nation would hurt diplomatic efforts toward bringing hostages home. Hamas, officials have said, could simply relocate to a country with worse relations with Washington, such as Turkey, Lebanon or Syria.Hamas leaders “should no longer be welcome in the capitals of any American partner,” a senior administration official said Friday, accusing the Palestinian militant group of rejecting multiple proposals. “Their continued presence in Doha is no longer viable or acceptable,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive diplomacy.Two officials familiar with the matter, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely about the negotiations, said that Qatar had accepted the demand and notified Hamas representatives that they must leave.But in his statement Saturday, Ansari, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said that the “reports regarding the Hamas office in Doha” were “inaccurate.”“The main goal of the office in Qatar is to be a channel of communication between the two parties,” Ansari said.But it was unclear if the office, whose purpose was to facilitate the discussions between Qatar and Hamas, would remain operational while the negotiations are paused. Senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad denied that they had been told to leave Doha. “This news seems illogical and lacks a solid foundation,” he said.Amid the diplomatic wrangling, a U.N.-backed panel also warned that “immediate action, within days not weeks” was needed to protect northern Gaza from imminent famine. In an alert issued Friday, the Famine Review Committee, a team of independent international food security and nutrition experts, said that the thresholds for famine may have already been crossed in the northern part of the territory. The risk of famine also exists for the whole of the Gaza Strip, it said.“It can therefore be assumed that starvation, malnutrition, and excess mortality due to malnutrition and disease, are rapidly increasing in these areas,” the committee said of the north, which it described as under “siege.”Israel last month began a large-scale offensive in northern Gaza, where it said Hamas fighters had regrouped. It sealed off the area, blocked new food and aid from coming in, and unleashed wave after wave of air and artillery strikes. At times, the military has allowed residents to walk south toward Gaza City, which is also destroyed, but not without searching and screening the population. Videos and images posted by the military from northern Gaza have shown dozens of men blindfolded and stripped down to their underwear, some of whom were carted off by Israeli military vehicles in the middle of the night, according to the footage.Philippa Greer, the head lawyer for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, the agency for Palestinian refugees, said Saturday in a post on X that she saw “clusters of people” walking south from Gaza City to the central and southern areas of the Strip. One man was carrying a white flag as he led his family, she wrote alongside a video of what remained of the city.“Women about to collapse, dragging bags over the ground, walking backwards, stopping and closing their eyes,” she wrote. “A man on the ground in underwear, with soldiers near the checkpoint.”But even as civilians fled south, conditions there were “also rapidly deteriorating,” Sally Abi Khalil, Middle East director at Oxfam International, a nonprofit that works to end poverty, said in a statement.Khalil said that it was a “crime against humanity for a country to unleash famine upon a population.” Israel is using “starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza,” she said, “while the rest of the world has stood by and watched.”The United States last month warned Israel that if it did not take steps within 30 days to increase aid to Gaza, it could risk military assistance from Washington. On Tuesday, one week ahead of the deadline, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that “all attempts by humanitarian organizations to deliver food to people in the besieged areas of North Gaza governorate have been blocked by the Israeli authorities.”Israel was also waging war to its north, carrying out at least 3,250 airstrikes in Lebanon over the past month, in an effort to dislodge Hezbollah militants near the border. According to a Washington Post analysis of Lebanese government data, Israel has carried out an average of 101 strikes daily from Oct. 7 to Nov. 7. Most of the attacks have targeted the two southern Lebanese provinces closest to the border with Israel, including areas where Hezbollah fighters have clashed with invading Israeli troops, according to the data.The pace of the airstrikes has not slowed, despite regional and Western efforts to secure a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, and as Israeli officials have touted successes in degrading the militant group’s capabilities, the data shows.The air raids, which the Israeli military says are aimed at Hezbollah-related facilities and at ending the group’s attacks on communities in northern Israel, have struck residential homes and buildings in Lebanon, and set off a mass exodus from towns and villages across the country. People who have fled bombardment in the south have been killed in airstrikes where they sheltered farther north.Evacuation orders issued by Israel on the social media network X — sometimes in the middle of the night — have not prevented casualties from the attacks, and many airstrikes have landed in areas outside Israel’s evacuation zones.Pietsch and Hudson reported from Washington and Fahim and Cheeseman from Beirut.
