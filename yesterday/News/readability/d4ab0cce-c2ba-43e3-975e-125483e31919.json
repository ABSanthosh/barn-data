  "text": "ReutersFifteen people were killed and at least 35 injured after a man drove into large crowds in New Orleans, Louisiana, in the early hours of New Year's Day, authorities have said.Here's what we know so far about what happened and the perpetrator. How did the attack unfold?Webcam appears to show police running to New Orleans attack sceneAt 03:15 local time on New Year's Day, a Ford pick-up truck rammed into crowds gather on Bourbon Street in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter.CCTV footage shows a white, Ford F-150 Lightning vehicle driving onto the pavement to get around a police car before hitting pedestrians.Police described the act as \"very intentional\", adding that the attacker - identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar - was \"hell-bent on creating the carnage and the damage that he did\".\"This man was trying to run over as many people as he possibly could\", said New Orleans Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick.Jabbar was also armed and fired on law enforcement, injuring two officers. He was then killed by police gunfire.Whit Davis, from Shreveport, Louisiana, told the BBC that he was held in a bar with a large group in the aftermath of the attack while police secured the scene.When they left, they \"were walking past dead and injured bodies all over the street\", he said. Latest updates: Police identify New Orleans attack suspectWho was Shamsud-Din Jabbar?The FBI has named the assailant as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, an Army veteran and US citizen from Texas.A flag associated with the Islamic State group was found in the vehicle he was driving and the FBI said it was investigating what affiliations Jabbar may have had with terrorist groups.The agency also said investigators did not believe that the suspect was solely responsible for the attack. Suspected improvised explosive devices were found in the area.A long gun with a \"suppressive device\" on it - acting as a silencer - was also recovered.According to a now-removed LinkedIn profile, Jabbar had worked in various roles in the US Army, including in human resources and IT, before he was discharged.He studied at George State University from 2015 to 2017, graduating with a degree in Computer Information Systems.He also appears to have worked in real estate, holding a license that expired in 2021. He had a criminal record, relating to traffic offences and theft.The pick-up truck he was driving was electric and believed to have been rented in Texas via an app. Watch: FBI gives update on New Orleans attackerWho were the victims?Police said 10 people were killed and at least 35 injured. None have been publicly named.The University of Georgia's president said one of its students was critically injured, while the Israeli government said two nationals were among those hurt. Police said it appeared that the victims were mainly locals from New Orleans, even though many tourists were visiting for New Year celebrations and the now-postponed Sugar Bowl, part of the American football college play-offs. It was due to kick off later on Wednesday evening at the Caesar Superdome, which is not far from scene of the attack.Where did this happen?Bourbon Street is a well-known nightlife and tourist hotspot that is filled with restaurants, bars and clubs with live music.It is within New Orleans' French Quarter, a lively area that attracts tourists and locals, especially to celebrate New Year.It was established by the French in 1718, and the original grid of streets designed back then is at the heart of what draws visitors to the city.Every year, upwards of a million people flock to its famous Mardi Gras carnival and parade in the spring, famous for the strings of colourful beads worn by party-goers.",
