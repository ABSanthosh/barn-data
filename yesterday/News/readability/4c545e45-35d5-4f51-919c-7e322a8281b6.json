  "text": "President Donald Trump again spoke about making Canada the 51st state of the United States as he gave an interview with NBC News' Meet the Press but he said it would not come to the point where he has to use military to take over Canada, but the same can't be said about Greenland. Trump said he would talk to Mark Carney about the issue once he comes to the White House. \"You know why? We subsidize Canada to the tune of $200 billion a year. We don’t need their cars. In fact, we don’t want their cars. We don’t need their energy. We don’t even want their energy. We have more than they do. We don’t want their lumber. We have great lumber. All I have to do is free it up from the environmental lunatics. We don’t need anything that they have. We’re giving them — I asked, I asked Mr Trudeau — who I call Governor Trudeau, not Prime Minister, Governor — I said, “Governor Trudeau, could I ask you one question? Why are we giving you $200 billion? Why are we subsidizing Canada?” If Canada was a state it wouldn’t cost us. It would be great.\"\"It would be such a great — it would be a cherished state. And, if you look at our map, if you look at the geography — I’m a real estate guy at heart. When I look down at that without that artificial line that was drawn with a ruler many years ago — was just an artificial line, goes straight across. You don’t even realize. What a beautiful country it would be. It would be great. But, I don’t think the American public wants me to pay $200 billion a year to subsidize Canada. Again, remember this, we don’t need their cars, we don’t need their lumber, we don’t need their energy. We don’t need anything. We do very little business with Canada. They do all of their business practically with us. They need us. We don’t need them,\" Trump said. \"Would you rule put military force to take Canada?\" Trump was asked. \"Well, I think we’re not going to ever get to that point. It could happen. Something could happen with Greenland. I’ll be honest, we need that for national and international security,\" Trump said adding that he doesn't see it with Canada. On Greenland, Trump said he is not saying he would send his military to take over the autonomous territory of Greenland under the Danish kingdom but he is not ruling it out. \"We need Greenland very badly. Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we’ll take care of, and we’ll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security,\" Trump said.",
