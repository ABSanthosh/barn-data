Credit...Matthias Schrader/Associated PressJune 24, 2025Updated 10:34 a.m. ETNATO opened a high-level meeting on Tuesday against the backdrop of one war in the Middle East overshadowing another on the military alliance’s doorstep. A tentative cease-fire between Israel and Iran is expected to dominate discussions, muting mention of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.But NATO has other things to worry about at its annual summit of alliance leaders in The Hague, the Netherlands — namely, maintaining a unified front amid an internal spat over military spending.A new cease-fire, announced by President Trump late Monday, could rally NATO states toward a common goal. “Counterintuitively, this could have a positive effect on the NATO summit,” said Liana Fix, a Europe expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, because it could distract from “escalation on other issues.”But there was uncertainty Tuesday over whether the cease-fire had taken hold, with Mr. Trump suggesting that both countries had continued fighting.“Heading to NATO where, at worst, it will be a much calmer period than what I just went through with Israel and Iran,” Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social.“Hopefully, much will be accomplished!” he wrote.Mark Rutte, NATO’s affable secretary general, predicted that the question of the cease-fire would not draw attention from the summit’s main focus.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
