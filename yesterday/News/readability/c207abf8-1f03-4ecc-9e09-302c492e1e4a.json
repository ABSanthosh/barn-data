  "text": "Elon Musk and Laura LoomerA growing feud between Elon Musk and MAGA supporters unfolded on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, as several influencers accused the billionaire of silencing them following a clash over immigration and H-1B visas. Prominent MAGA influencer Laura Loomer alleged her account was downgraded from premium, removing her blue tick and blocking monetization, after criticizing foreign workers and immigration policies.“I have now also been banned from being able to purchase premium. We are always told to buy premium. But if you criticize immigration, you get your premium check taken away and also get banned from buying Premium. Pure censorship. MAGA has been silenced,” Loomer posted on X.At least ten other MAGA influencers echoed similar grievances, accusing Musk of censorship. X has not issued an official response to the claims.In what appeared to be his response, Musk tweeted: “That said, any accounts found to be engaged in coordinated attacks to spam target accounts with mute/blocks will themselves be categorized – correctly – as spam. Live by the spam, die by the spam.”Immigration sparks ‘India vs MAGA’ RiftThe controversy began when Loomer criticized the appointment of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian-American, as Trump’s AI policy adviser. She targeted Indian immigrants in a series of incendiary tweets, labeling them “third-world invaders” and making disparaging remarks about India.Musk came to Krishnan’s defense and addressed the immigration debate, tweeting, “The ‘fixed pie’ fallacy is at the heart of much wrong-headed economic thinking. There is essentially infinite potential for job and company creation. Think of all the things that didn’t exist 20 or 30 years ago!”MAGA figures, including Loomer and former presidential candidate Nikki Haley, criticized Musk’s stance. The debate deepened with the involvement of Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy, who defended H-1B visas, aligning with Musk’s pro-immigration perspective.As tensions rise, President-elect Donald Trump has yet to comment on the discord among his supporters over the contentious issue.",
