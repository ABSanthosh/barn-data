Strong winds and bone-chilling temperatures could still be felt in Toronto on Monday when airlines added flights to make up for weekend cancellations due to the storm.\"The snow has stopped coming down, but frigid temperatures and high winds are moving in,\" the airport warned earlier, adding that it was \"expecting a busy day in our terminals with over 130,000 travellers on board around 1,000 flights.\"Federal Transport Minister Anita Anand confirmed there were 80 people on the flight. \"I'm closely following the serious incident at the Pearson Airport involving Delta Airlines flight 4819 from Minneapolis,\" she posted on X.Ontario Premier Doug Ford, meanwhile, said he was \"relieved there are no casualties after the incident at Toronto Pearson,\" adding that airport and local authorities were providing help.Canada's Transportation Safety Board said it was deploying a team of investigators to the site of the crash.This comes after other recent air incidents in North America including a mid-air collision between a US Army helicopter and a passenger jet in Washington that killed 67 people, and a medical transport plane crash in Philadelphia that left seven dead.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)
