  "text": "Hamas released four bodies Thursday that it said were hostages, including the remains of a mother and her two young children, members of the Bibas family, whose story came to symbolize the brutality of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks.However, while an Israeli forensic analysis overnight identified the bodies of the two children, Ariel and Kfir, the Israel Defense Forces said the third body received is not that of their mother, Shiri Bibas. “No match was found for any other hostage. This is an anonymous, unidentified body,” the IDF spokesman said.“This is a violation of utmost severity by the Hamas terrorist organization,” the IDF said.The fourth body was that of hostage Oded Lifshitz, whose family confirmed that his remains were identified.In Israel earlier Thursday, the exchange was marked with somber gatherings. Onlookers and senior Israeli officials alike described the national mood as one of deep anguish. The deaths of Shiri Bibas and her sons — Ariel, who was 4 years old, and Kfir, who was 8½ months old at the time of the abduction — had been suspected for months. Hamas said their bodies would be among those released Thursday.Crowds gathered in the rain in Gaza to watch the bodies be handed over to waiting Red Cross teams. Hamas fighters dressed in dark fatigues delivered the coffins one by one to the Red Cross, which transferred them into vehicles. The Red Cross then delivered the coffins to Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip.Shiri Bibas; her husband, Yarden; and their sons were taken from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. Yarden Bibas was released just over two weeks ago in an exchange.The release Thursday is the first time Hamas has handed over bodies to Israel since the Gaza ceasefire agreement was announced in January. So far under the deal, Hamas has released 33 Israelis and dual nationals in exchange for about 1,900 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.Israelis gathered along the highway in the country’s south to watch the coffins travel by convoy to Tel Aviv for forensic examination. Israel’s government had not confirmed the deaths of Shiri, Ariel and Kfir before it identified the bodies of the two children after examination.Aviella Kamilar, an animal therapist from nearby Kibbutz Reim, stood in the rain to watch the convoy pass.“It’s been unknown for so long. Especially with the Bibas family, we’ve been waiting and hoping for so long that the rumors were wrong, and they would be coming back alive,” she said. Kamilar said she felt compelled to pay her respects to the slain hostages.“The entire country feels shaken, just heartbroken by this,” Kamilar said. In the crowd around her, some were draped in Israeli flags; others held the yellow flags that have become a symbol of solidarity and support for the hostages and their families.Smaller crowds also gathered at what has become known as “Hostages Square” in Tel Aviv. Unlike during previous exchanges, on Thursday, the mood was somber and large screens at the square did not broadcast live feeds of the release.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that “Israel has received, via the Red Cross, the coffins of four fallen hostages,” and that their remains had been transferred to Israel for examination. “The families of the hostages have been informed, and our hearts are with them in this difficult time.”President Isaac Herzog said: “There are no words. Our hearts — the hearts of an entire nation — lie in tatters.”It is unclear how Shiri Bibas and her sons were killed. Hamas alleges that they were killed by an Israeli airstrike but has not provided any evidence. The IDF early Friday said that based on intelligence and forensic findings, as well as the assessment of “professional officials,” Ariel and Kfir were killed in captivity by militants in November 2023.Similar to past releases, Hamas fighters erected large propaganda posters at the site of the handover in Gaza. “The return of war = the return of your prisoners in coffins,” read one of the signs. Another image depicted Netanyahu as a vampire. Hamas fighters carried out a highly choreographed handover, displaying the coffins on a stage in front of cameras and crowds before passing the remains to the Red Cross.Hamas has come under fierce criticism for parading hostages in front of animated crowds during previous releases. The International Committee of the Red Cross has called for all exchanges to be carried out in a “dignified” manner.Hamas said the fourth body released Thursday was of Lifshitz, a retired journalist and peace activist who was 83 at the time of the Oct. 7 attacks. Lifshitz was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz with his wife, Yocheved, who was released by Hamas weeks later for “crushing humanitarian reasons,” according to a statement from the group at the time.The Lifshitz family issued a statement confirming that Oded’s body had been identified. “We had hoped and prayed so much for a different outcome,” the family said. “Now we can mourn the husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather who has been missing from us since October 7.”Yocheved, who is also in her 80s, described the “unimaginable hell” of her time in captivity, which included beatings and being held in a “spiderweb” of tunnels.Lifshitz’s daughter told the Associated Press in January that her father was shot in the hand and had fallen down as Hamas fighters attacked the kibbutz where her parents lived.“That’s when my mom saw him last, and she was taken over on a motorbike and then the terrorists burned the house down,” Sharone Lifschitz told the AP. “They put gas into the house, and it burned and it burned and it burned until everything they ever owned, everything, was ashes.”The latest statement from the Bibas family was on Tuesday, when the family said, “Until we receive definitive confirmation, our journey is not over.”Hamas fighters took at least 250 people hostage during the Oct. 7 attacks and killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. The Israeli assault on Gaza that began shortly afterward has devastated the Palestinian territory, leveling entire neighborhoods and leaving tens of thousands dead.Hamas has offered to expedite the release of hostages by freeing six people rather than the prescribed three on Saturday, hoping to build pressure on Israel to stick to the ceasefire agreement until the second phase. Netanyahu has said he remains ready to return to war in the Gaza Strip.Israel is expected to release hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons on Saturday after the Israeli hostages are released that day. Most are expected to be women and minors arrested in Gaza since the Oct. 7 attacks, according to a Hamas official.Next week, Hamas has said it will release the bodies of four more hostages, completing the final round of releases in the ceasefire’s first phase.Late Thursday night, a series of explosions hit at least three empty buses in central Israel in what officials said was a suspected terrorist attack. Undetonated explosives were also found, officials said.Five explosives were discovered, said Haim Sargrof, commander of the Israeli police’s Tel Aviv district. Several of the bombs were planted on buses that exploded in parking lots in the city of Bat Yam, a suburb of Tel Aviv, Bat Yam Mayor Tzvika Brot said in a statement on social media. Explosives were also found and neutralized in a parking lot in the nearby city of Holon, he added. No one was harmed.Hamas’s military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, put out a statement attributed to the West Bank-based Tulkarm Battalion saying that “the revenge for our martyrs will not be forgotten as long as the occupier remains on our land.”Where the Gaza ceasefire deal goes next is unclear. The agreement’s second phase is not assured. Israeli and Hamas negotiating teams were supposed to have begun talks on the second phase weeks ago, but Israel has delayed the participation of its team.The families of the hostages who are still held by Hamas in the Palestinian enclave have questioned the lack of progress on talks for the ceasefire’s second phase. They said in a statement that the stalled negotiations present a “clear and tangible” danger to their loved ones.Hamas continues to hold 66 hostages taken by the group during the Oct. 7 attacks. Of those hostages, about 30 are believed to be alive. Hamas is also holding two hostages who were taken about a decade ago, as well as the remains of an Israeli soldier whose body was taken around the same time.Sammy Westfall and Lior Soroka contributed to this report.",
