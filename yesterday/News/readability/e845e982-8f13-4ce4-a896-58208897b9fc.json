But Mr. Woldbye said, “We expect to be back in full operation, so 100 percent operation as a normal day” by Saturday.The Metropolitan Police in London said later on Friday, “After initial assessment, we are not treating this incident as suspicious, although inquiries do remain ongoing.” The police said counterterrorism officials would lead the investigation into the cause of the blaze, which broke out Thursday night at an electrical substation northeast of Heathrow.It was too early on Friday to calculate the precise cost of the outage. But the disruption raised questions about the resilience of Britain’s largest airport and why it appeared to be so reliant on a single electrical substation.ImageEfforts to douse the fire at the substation in Hayes, west London, on Friday.Credit...Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThank you for your patience while we verify access.
