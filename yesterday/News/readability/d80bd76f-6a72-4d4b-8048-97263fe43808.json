Videos verified by The New York Times showed that the building in Basta had been destroyed and adjacent buildings had been damaged. Two plumes of thick, acrid smoke could be seen rising above the city skyline.The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the strikes. But it has been systematically targeting Hezbollah leaders and sites in a heavy bombing campaign in areas in and around Beirut and in a ground invasion in southern Lebanon.The strikes came hours after United Nations officials said that Israeli forces had fired on U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, wounding two and touching off international criticism of the Israeli military’s offensive against Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group.The U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, known by its acronym, UNIFIL, said the two soldiers, from Indonesia, had been injured when an Israeli tank fired toward and directly hit an observation tower at the force’s headquarters in Naqoura, Lebanon.At a separate base nearby, the U.N. force said, Israeli soldiers fired at the entrance of a bunker where peacekeepers were sheltering, damaging vehicles and communications equipment.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
