  "text": "A Delta Air Lines regional jet crashed while landing at Toronto Pearson International Airport on Monday, flipping upside down on the snow-covered tarmac — but, remarkably, leaving all 80 people on board alive.All 76 passengers and four crew members on Delta Connection flight 4819 were evacuated, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Images show the plane on its back, with at least one of its wings clipped and snow on its underbelly as airport workers hose it down.Eighteen passengers were brought to hospitals with injuries, Delta said. At least three of them — including a child, a man in his 60s and a woman in her 40s — were critically injured, said Joshua McNamara, a spokesman for the air ambulance and medical transport service Ornge.The Bombardier CRJ-900 departed Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport at about 10:30 a.m. local time Monday, according to the aircraft tracker FlightAware. The flight, operated by Minneapolis-based regional airline Endeavor Air, crashed while landing at the Toronto airport around 2:45 p.m. local time, the FAA said. (In a Monday afternoon update, Delta gave the time of the crash as about 2:15 p.m. local time.)Videos shared online capture emergency crews helping passengers crawl out of the wreckage. One clip, which appeared to be taken inside the plane, portrays a chaotic aftermath of seat cushions and debris scattered across the overturned cabin. Flight attendants, walking along what was once the ceiling, shout for passengers to “drop everything” and exit through an emergency exit door.“The hearts of the entire global Delta family are with those affected by today’s incident at Toronto-Pearson International Airport,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement. “I want to express my thanks to the many Delta and Endeavor team members and the first responders on site.”The crash comes amid heightened scrutiny of flight safety following a midair collision over the Potomac River last month between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines passenger jet near Reagan National Airport. That incident raised questions about operational protocols and communication.What caused the Delta aircraft to flip remains unknown, but conditions at the time were harsh. Westerly winds — which blow from west to east — were gusting at up to 40 mph just before 3 p.m. local time, and the temperature was about 17 degrees. Snow showers were in the area, with the airport reporting five-mile visibility.Earlier Monday, the airport warned that frigid temperatures and high winds were moving in, creating difficult conditions for both ground crews and pilots. The airport was expecting a “busy day,” it wrote on X, handling over 130,000 travelers across 1,000 flights as airlines scrambled to recover from a weekend storm that dumped nearly 9 inches of snow. Crews had worked overnight to clear the runways “so planes can safely arrive and depart.”The crash prompted the FAA to temporarily issue a ground stop order for the airport. Air traffic in and out had resumed as of 5 p.m. local time, but two runways remained closed. Delta said it had canceled its flights to and from Toronto Pearson for the rest of Monday.The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is leading an investigation into the crash with assistance from the National Transportation Safety Board. Anita Anand, Canada’s transportation minister, wrote on X that she was “closely following the serious incident.”Scott Dunham, a retired NTSB investigator, said that after pilots have landed, they’re supposed to communicate a runway’s “braking action” to control tower workers, who relay those conditions to other incoming flights. If a runway’s traction gets bad enough, airport operations dispatch a crew to plow snow or otherwise fix the issue.Investigators will try to discover the conditions of the runway when the Delta plane landed and whether the tower had communicated that status to the pilots ahead of time, Dunham said. But, he added, he would be surprised if poor runway conditions were the problem in Toronto, where airport staff is used to snow and ice.Something “pretty severe” clearly happened to the Delta flight, Dunham said, noting that his assessment was based almost entirely on photos of the plane upside down.“It’s pretty hard to go inverted,” he said.Ian Duncan and Ben Noll contributed to this report.",
