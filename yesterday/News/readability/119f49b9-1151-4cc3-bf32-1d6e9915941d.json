Zhao focused on high-end devices, including foldable smartphones, as he looked for Honor to look beyond China and challenge the likes of Samsung and Apple.Honor's market share in China has risen from 9.8% in 2020 to over 15% in 2024, according to Counterpoint Research. Outside of China, Honor's market share hit 2.3% in 2024, compared to under 1% in 2020.The company has looked to keep pace with rivals by launching artificial intelligence features on its device.Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research, said the company's focus on high-end devices and technology is likely to continue under the new leadership.\"Honor's focus on premiumization should continue if the brand wants to continue building its brand equity and differentiation point vs existing competitors, especially in premium markets such as Europe,\" Shah told CNBC. \"The focus on innovative foldable designs and advanced AI features and close partnerships with leading component suppliers would be key.\"Zhao's successor Li will be tasked with trying to expand Honor's presence overseas amid fierce competition, with a focus on making the brand more recognizable.\"Many don't know Honor\" outside of China, Counterpoint's Shah said. \"Building brand equity is tough and the company needs more time, money and differentiation points.\"",
