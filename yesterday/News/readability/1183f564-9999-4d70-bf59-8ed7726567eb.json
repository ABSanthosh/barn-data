  "text": "ROME — U.S. officials reported “very good progress” in the second round of talks with Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program, and Iran’s foreign minister called the session Saturday “a good one.”President Donald Trump has said he will prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons through diplomacy if possible but by force if necessary. Iran wants relief from sanctions.The current meetings, while preliminary, have been the highest-level contact between Washington and Tehran in a decade. The countries severed diplomatic relations in 1980; Iran has been on the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism since 1984.“Today, in Rome over four hours in our second round of talks, we made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,” a senior Trump administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the administration, said in a statement.“Following the previous session, I can say this sitting was also a good one,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Iranian state television. “I can say the talks are moving forward. We succeeded to reach a better agreement this time about principles and targets.”The sides sat in separate rooms at the Omani Embassy in Rome on Saturday as Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi passed messages between them, according to Iranian Foreign Ministry accounts.Technical negotiations are to begin on Wednesday in Oman, Araghchi said, and the sides will meet for a third time April 26. The technical negotiations will allow the sides to provide more “details,” he said, as they design a framework for the talks.“We are going to meet next Saturday to study the result of their work and see how close it is to a deal,” he said.The Trump administration has come under increasing pressure to abandon diplomacy with Iran for military force, pressure that’s likely to build if negotiations do not show progress quickly.Convoys of black sedans with tinted windows ferried the negotiating teams into the embassy compound in Rome’s Camilluccia neighborhood. Real estate magnate Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Middle East envoy, led the U.S. side; Araghchi led the Iranian side.The sides, which met for the first time in Oman last week, were expected to present their negotiating positions in more detail in Rome. Iranian officials said they were hoping to get greater clarity on the U.S. position after a debate within the Trump administration on Iran policy appeared to surface last week.“Given the contradictory positions we have heard from various American officials over the past few days, we expect the American side to first clear up the serious ambiguities that have arisen regarding its intentions,” said Esmail Baghaei, a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry.Trump says he seeks only to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, but others in his administration say Iran’s nuclear program must be dismantled completely.Iran’s Foreign Ministry, which says the program aims to produce energy, not weapons, has preemptively rejected that demand. “Maintaining Iran’s technical and nuclear achievements is a must in this process,” Baghaei told Iranian state television Saturday.“We have simultaneously announced that we are ready to disambiguate any doubt that might still exist about the peaceful nuclear program of Iran,” he said. “In return, of course we expect that the illegal sanctions against Iran … must be lifted.”Journalists, standing across the street from the compound, took pictures and cellphone video. Iran has worked to control the narrative of the talks. A small Iranian state television crew traveled to Rome with Araghchi and filed live updates through the day.Television correspondent Hossnie Shobeiri, who also traveled with Araghchi last week to Oman, warned viewers Saturday against listening to false media reports. “These are all attempts to deviate the talks from their main target,” she said.That opening session in Muscat, the Omani capital, was also mediated by Busaidi. Wikoff and Araghchi met briefly at the end, but the interaction apparently was not photographed or recorded on video.Iranian officials were quick to emphasize that the Rome meeting was also indirect.“The Omani Foreign Minister is having a busy day, keeping moving messages from room to room,” Baghaei said.Trump has said he would prefer face-to-face talks, a format he says would allow the sides to reach an agreement faster. But Tehran so far has refused, apparently out of concern that images of direct negotiations with the country it routinely vilifies could undermine the regime.Dismantling the program completely would go further than the 2015 Iran nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration with Iran, the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, Germany and the European Union. Trump, running for president in 2016, railed against the agreement; as president in 2018, he pulled the United States out of it.The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned this week that Iran was “not far” from developing a nuclear weapon — a growing concern as tensions between Iran and Israel grow.“It’s like a puzzle. They have the pieces, and one day they could eventually put them together,” IAEA chief Rafael Grossi told Le Monde. “There’s still a way to go before they get there. But they’re not far off, that has to be acknowledged.”Analysts have put the time at from months to a year.“I’m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon,” Trump said Friday. “I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.”Iran’s negotiating team has “full authority for a deal,” a senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader said Saturday on social media. Ali Shamkhani outlined “nine principals” for Tehran, including the rejection of the so-called Libya model — a complete dismantling.Other principals included “guarantees,” “the removal of sanctions” and “investment facilitation.”As negotiations continue, they’ll grow more difficult.Iran’s nuclear program has expanded significantly since the 2015 deal. Any new agreement will require extensive verification, probably more difficult now.The IAEA would probably play a key role in verifying Iran’s compliance. Grossi visited Tehran last week and met with Italy Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani on Saturday.",
