  "text": "A beloved motorcycle company has announced bad news as sales plunge amid economic uncertainty. On May 1, 2025, Harley-Davidson reported that global motorcycle retail sales were \"down 21 percent year-over-year, driven by a volatile macroeconomic environment and overall consumer uncertainty.\" The company noted that Harley-Davidson Motor Company revenue was \"down 27 percent year-over-year, primarily due to a planned decrease in motorcycle shipments.\" As a result, Harley-Davidson wrote, \"Due to the uncertain global tariff situation and macroeconomic conditions, we are withdrawing our full year 2025 financial outlook from February 5, 2025.\" Despite the bad news, the company cited some positives. \"Our first quarter results were ahead of our expectations in many areas, while retail sales in the U.S. came in softer than anticipated,\" Jochen Zeitz, Chairman, President and CEO, Harley-Davidson, wrote in a press release. \"We remain focused on navigating the challenging economic and tariff environment, through diligent execution of our cost productivity measures, supply chain mitigation, tight operating expense control and reducing dealer inventory,\" he wrote. \"In addition, we remain committed to driving retail sales through increased marketing initiatives as we enter the riding season.\" According to Harley-Davidson's press release, numerous areas were down. \"First quarter global motorcycle shipments decreased 33 percent, which was mostly expected but also reflects the softer than expected demand environment,\" the company reported. \"Revenue was down 27 percent driven primarily by the planned decrease in wholesale shipments and unfavorable foreign currency, partially offset by favorable mix and favorable global pricing and net incentives. Parts \u0026 Accessories revenue was down 14 percent and apparel revenue was down 11 percent, due to lower customer traffic at dealer stores,\" the company noted.
