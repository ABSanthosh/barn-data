  "text": "US President Joe Biden has called on President-elect Donald Trump to reconsider his proposed tariffs on Canadian, Mexican, and Chinese goods, calling them “counterproductive” as the transition of power moves forward from the Democrats to the Republicans.“I hope he rethinks it. I think it’s a counterproductive thing to do,” Biden told reporters on Thursday in Nantucket, Massachusetts, while on holiday, saying things could become the opposite of the desired goal. He stressed the importance of maintaining strong ties with neighbouring allies, saying, “We’re surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and two allies, Mexico and Canada. The last thing we need to do is begin to screw up those relationships,” he continued.Trump’s tariff announcementTrump recently announced plans to impose tariffs to pressure Canada and Mexico to improve border security, address immigration issues, and combat drug smuggling and fentanyl exports. In a post on Truth Social, the President-elect proposed 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods, alongside a 10 per cent tariff on Chinese imports.“Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem,” Trump wrote. “Until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!,\" he concluded.Responses from neighboursMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has pushed back strongly against the proposed tariffs, warning of potential countermeasures. “One tariff would be followed by another in response, and so on until we put at risk common businesses,” she said.Despite Trump’s assertion that a recent phone call with Sheinbaum had been “very productive,” the Mexican leader clarified she had not agreed to close the border as Trump claimed. “In our conversation with President Trump, I explained to him the comprehensive strategy that Mexico has followed to address the migration phenomenon, respecting human rights,” she posted on X. She further said that a trade war could be avoided.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced concerns but said that his conversation with Trump was a “good call.” He pointed out that Canada’s measures to address border challenges were different from Mexico's.Transition of powerOn Thanksgiving, Biden expressed gratitude for the smooth transition to the incoming administration, saying, “I want to make sure it goes smoothly.” While urging Trump to reconsider the tariff threats, he also discussed foreign policy, including a cease-fire deal between Israel and Lebanon and the release of three Americans from Chinese detention.Regarding Trump’s 10 per cent tariff threat to China, Biden said, Chinese President Xi Jinping \"doesn't want to make a mistake.\"“I am not saying he is our best buddy, but he understands what’s at stake,\" he added.Biden noted that illegal border crossings had significantly decreased since Trump’s first term, despite the former president’s continued campaign focus on the issue.",
