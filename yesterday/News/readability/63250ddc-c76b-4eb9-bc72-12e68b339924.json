On Thursday, he clarified that these statements did not represent the Australian government's position.A statement on Rudd's personal website explained that these comments were made when he was leading a US-based think tank, prior to his diplomatic role.In 2020, one of the now-removed comments had characterised Trump as \"the most destructive president in history\".The statement explained that Rudd removed these past commentaries from his personal website and social media platforms to show respect for the U.S. presidential office following Trump's election.The removal aimed to prevent any misinterpretation of these comments as Rudd's diplomatic stance or the Australian government's official position.On Thursday, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong expressed confidence in the alliance between the centre-left government of Anthony Albanese and the United States, their primary security partner. This includes the AUKUS agreement for Australia's acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines from the US in the 2030s.Wong mentioned her meeting with former Trump administration Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during the election campaign, noting cross-party backing for AUKUS.Speaking on the Today programme, Wong emphasised, \"The United States is our principal strategic partner. We share very, very clear strategic objectives. We both want a region which is stable, a region which is peaceful, and there's bipartisan support for AUKUS, which is a key part of that.\"US Election Results Live Updates: China says it respects America's choice, congratulates TrumpChina acknowledged the outcome of the American election and extended congratulations to Donald Trump on his win, whilst a state newspaper advocated for a practical approach to manage bilateral relations.Trump, the Republican candidate who pledged to impose strict tariffs, secured the presidency with a decisive victory against Democrat Kamala Harris in Tuesday's election.\"We respect the choice of the American people and congratulate Mr. Trump on his election as president,\" stated a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson in an announcement late on Wednesday.The state-operated China Daily published an editorial on Wednesday suggesting that Trump's second term could establish a \"new beginning in China-U.S. relations if the chance that has been offered is not wasted.\"The editorial noted that the incoming American administration could enhance dialogue with China to address various issues, \"which range from the Taiwan question to trade and to the South China Sea.\"US Election Results Live Updates: Trump accepts White House invitation from BidenDonald Trump's team has confirmed Trump will meet with President Biden at the White House to discuss transition matters. Whilst the timing remains unconfirmed, Trump's communications director Steven Cheung indicated the meeting would occur in the near future. Cheung also noted that Trump expressed gratitude for Biden's congratulatory telephone call received on Wednesday.US Election Results Live Updates: Trump Media gains post-election, even as Truth Social parent reports $19 million quarterly lossDonald Trump's Truth Social's parent organisation reported a substantial loss of $19.2 million in the previous quarter, coinciding with his presidential victory announcement.According to a Tuesday evening financial report, Trump Media and Technology Group's losses were primarily attributed to legal expenses exceeding $12 million, coupled with diminishing revenue. The following day saw a rise in share prices, likely influenced by Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris rather than financial performance.Former Republican US Representative and current CEO Devin Nunes issued a statement indicating the company's interest in expansion opportunities, including potential mergers with organisations that could utilise Trump Media's technology and brand recognition.The company's establishment followed Trump's exclusion from Twitter and Facebook after the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot.The quarter ending September 30 showed revenue just above $1 million, marking a nearly 6% reduction compared to the previous year. The Sarasota, Florida-based Trump Media has accumulated losses surpassing $363 million in the current year.The company attributed certain expenses to launching their streaming service, Truth+.US Election Results Live Updates: Ukraine's Zelenskyy says congratulated Trump in 'excellent' callUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced on Wednesday that he held a conversation with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump after his electoral success.\"We agreed to maintain close dialogue and advance our cooperation.

His assessment highlighted the growing disconnect between the party and its traditional voter base.\"It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them. First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and Black workers as well. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And they're right.\"2024 US Election Live Updates: Slovenians hail Melania Trump return as US first ladyIn the Slovenian town of Sevnica, where Melania Trump grew up, locals celebrated her return as first lady with their town's signature confectionery items bearing her name.\"I'm glad. She is 'ours' after all,\" Irena Mavric, a 68-year-old pensioner, told AFP -- though she expressed reservations about her husband's politics, suggesting she disagreed with \"the Americans' choice\".Donald Trump secured a decisive electoral victory, defeating Kamala Harris in an unexpected return to presidential office.Sevnica's mayor Srecko Ocvirk expressed his thoughts to AFP, stating, \"I am proud and satisfied... I believe she (Melania Trump) will once again fulfil her duties responsibly and with excellence, as she did during the first mandate.\"By chance, Sevnica, a small town of 4,500 people situated 90 kilometres east of Ljubljana, was hosting its local festival that day, bringing unusual activity to its typically peaceful streets.Although no specific celebrations were organised for Trump's victory, it remained the primary topic of conversation amongst townspeople.The mayor particularly highlighted his appreciation that Barron, the son of Donald and Melania Trump, maintains fluency in Slovenian.2024 US elections result: GOP tightens its strong grip on the West Virginia Legislature, where women also lost seatsThe Republican Party has strengthened its dominance in the West Virginia Legislature through recent electoral victories, significantly reducing Democratic representation in the 134-seat chamber and establishing one of the nation's most substantial legislative supermajorities.Democratic presence in the state Senate will decrease to two out of 34 seats in January, whilst House representation drops to at least eight out of 100 delegates, with two races still undecided as of Wednesday.Republican AscendancyThe transition of a U.S. Senate seat from independent Joe Manchin to Republican Jim Justice marks a historic moment, as the Republican Party assumes control of all statewide elected positions for the first time in nearly 100 years.West Virginia GOP Chairman Matt Herridge expressed his enthusiasm in a Facebook video on Wednesday, filmed at the U.S. Capitol, stating \"today is a amazing day for the state of West Virginia and for this country. We are poised for great things.\"\"I was a child of the Reagan years. I remember Ronald Reagan said 'it's morning in America again.' Well, it's morning in America once again, and also in the great state of West Virginia,\" he said.Declining Female RepresentationThe election results indicate a reduction in female legislative representation in a state that already has the lowest number of women legislators nationally.Currently, 16 women serve in the Legislature, with four in the state Senate and 12 in the House. Republican state Senators Donna Boley, Amy Grady and Patricia Rucker retained their positions in Tuesday's election, while Senator Laura Wakim Chapman's seat remains secure until 2026.As of Wednesday, nine women secured positions in the state House - one Democrat and eight Republicans - with two races involving female candidates still awaiting final results.2024 US election results live updates: Donald Trump mass deportation pledge faces legal, economic barriersDonald Trump has announced plans to initiate an unprecedented deportation operation targeting undocumented immigrants in the United States immediately upon taking office. However, executing such a plan faces significant challenges.\"Rhetoric is one thing,\" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell University. \"Actual implementation is something else.\"\"The Constitution provides due process for everyone in the country, not just US citizens, so Trump cannot just round up people and send them out of the country the next day,\" Yale-Loehr told AFP. \"There already is a backlog of over 3.6 million cases in our immigration courts.\"The proposed mass deportation presents substantial obstacles, including legal considerations, humanitarian concerns, substantial financial implications and complex operational requirements.According to Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council (AIC), the current undocumented immigrant population in the United States ranges between 13 million and 15 million people, making large-scale deportation a complex undertaking.2024 US Election Results Live Updates: Biden will address the nation on Thursday, says White HouseThe White House said that President Biden will address the nation on Thursday. Biden congratulated Donald Trump on his victory and invited him to meet at the White House.US Election Results Live Updates: Biden calls to congratulate Donald TrumpPresident Biden telephoned to congratulate President-elect Trump on his electoral triumph and invite him to a White House meeting to discuss transitional matters.The White House administration indicated they would arrange a suitable date \"in the near future.\" Biden is scheduled to deliver remarks to the nation on Thursday concerning the election outcome, which will significantly impact his presidential legacy. Additionally, Biden congratulated Vice President Harris regarding her campaign efforts.

The allegations ranged from concealing a payment to Stormy Daniels during his 2016 campaign to his efforts to challenge his 2020 electoral defeat. Read moreUS election results: Harris called Trump to concede US presidential electionVice President Kamala Harris extended her congratulations to Republican victor Donald Trump via telephone on Wednesday following his triumph in the US presidential election, according to two members of Harris's staff.A senior aide to Harris revealed that during their conversation, they addressed the significance of ensuring a smooth transition of power and the necessity of serving as a leader for the entire American populace. Harris is expected to deliver public comments later on Wednesday.US election result 2024 Live Updates: Netanyahu discusses 'Iranian threat' with TrumpBenjamin Netanyahu, Israel's Prime Minister, extended his congratulations to Donald Trump following his victory in the U.S. presidential election through a telephone conversation, according to a Wednesday announcement from Netanyahu's office.\"The conversation was warm and cordial,\" Netanyahu's office said in a statement.During their discussion, they addressed concerns about Iran and emphasised the importance of collaborative efforts to ensure Israel's security, as detailed in the statement.2024 US Election Results Live: North Dakota voters reject key ballot measures on property taxes, marijuana, and constitutional amendmentsNorth Dakota voters decisively rejected a series of high-profile ballot measures, including one to eliminate local property taxes, a second to legalize recreational marijuana, and a third aiming to tighten requirements for amending the state constitution. The outcomes reflect voter concerns over potential impacts on state services and governance.Rejection of property tax eliminationA proposal to end local property taxes—currently based on assessed property values—was turned down by voters. Supporters argued that North Dakota's rising property taxes burden residents and are difficult to understand. However, critics warned that eliminating these taxes would force the state to replace $3.15 billion in local government revenue every two years, potentially cutting into services. With a forecasted $5 billion in tax revenue for the current biennium, state leaders argued that replacing local taxes could strain the budget and essential services.Marijuana legalization defeatedA measure to legalize recreational marijuana also failed to pass. This measure would have allowed adults 21 and over to possess and use marijuana at home or on private property, while prohibiting public use and setting guidelines for cultivation and distribution. Although proponents emphasized that legalization could free up law enforcement resources to tackle more severe issues like fentanyl, opponents cited the potential social and health risks of marijuana use. North Dakota joins several other states, such as Florida and South Dakota, where similar measures failed this year, despite a nationwide trend toward legalization.Stricter constitutional amendment requirements rejectedVoters also declined a measure aimed at tightening rules for citizen-initiated amendments to the state constitution. The proposed changes included restricting initiatives to a single subject, mandating eligibility requirements for petitioners, increasing required signatures, and requiring initiatives to pass both primary and general elections. State Sen. Janne Myrdal, who introduced the measure, voiced concerns over outside influence on the state’s constitution, suggesting that North Dakota’s laws were vulnerable to well-funded out-of-state interests. However, opponents argued that these restrictions could hinder citizens' rights to democratic participation.Additional ballot measuresVoters approved a separate amendment to update outdated language about disabilities in the state constitution. A measure to revise administrative rules for managing North Dakota's $11 billion oil tax savings is still pending final results.2024 US Election Results Live: President Trump calls India a 'True Friend,' says 'The whole world loves PM Modi'In a post-election call, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated U.S. President Donald Trump on his decisive victory, extending his support and highlighting the strong performance of the Republican Party in the Congressional elections. According to sources, both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to work closely on advancing world peace and addressing global challenges.During the call, President Trump expressed admiration for India and PM Modi, calling India a \"magnificent country\" and describing PM Modi as a \"magnificent man.\" Trump emphasized his personal rapport with Modi, stating, \"The whole world loves PM Modi,\" and underscored the enduring bond between the two nations. He also noted that Modi was one of the first world leaders he reached out to following his victory.The leaders’ exchange reflects the positive trajectory of India-U.S. relations, with both countries keen on strengthening their strategic partnership. Under Trump’s previous term, the India-U.S. relationship grew significantly across sectors like defense, trade, and energy. Modi's early congratulations and Trump’s expressions of friendship indicate that this cooperation is set to deepen in the coming years.Sources confirmed that the two leaders look forward to working together in advancing their shared vision of peace and stability worldwide.2024 US Election Results Live: PM Modi dials Donald Trump after 'spectacular' winPrime Minister Narendra Modi has congratulated US President Donald Trump on his “spectacular victory” in the presidential race, signaling a renewed commitment to strengthening the strategic partnership between India and the United States.In a statement posted on social media, Modi shared his excitement about resuming collaboration with Trump, emphasizing key sectors such as technology, defence, energy, and space. \"Had a great conversation with my friend, President @realDonaldTrump, congratulating him on his spectacular victory. Looking forward to working closely together once again to further strengthen India-US relations across technology, defence, energy, space, and several other sectors,\" Modi wrote.2024 US Election Results Live: Trump's victory poses threat to global climate action ahead of COP29 in BakuDonald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election could cast a long shadow over the upcoming COP29 climate conference in Baku, scheduled for November 11-22. With Trump set to return to the White House, there are growing concerns that his administration may either withdraw from the Paris Agreement again or significantly scale back U.S. climate commitments, mirroring his first term in office.Trump, who has frequently referred to climate change as a \"hoax,\" could announce his intention to reverse the climate policies enacted under President Joe Biden. The U.S. rejoined the Paris Agreement in 2021, and Biden’s administration has since pursued aggressive climate action, including the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which marked the largest climate spending package in U.S. history. If Trump proceeds with dismantling these efforts, it would deal a significant blow to global efforts to combat climate change and could jeopardize progress toward securing new financial commitments for post-2025 climate action.One of the most damaging outcomes would be if Trump were to withdraw the U.S. from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a scenario discussed during the election campaign. Such a move would complicate the ability of future U.S. presidents to rejoin the treaty, requiring Senate approval—a difficult hurdle given the current political landscape.Although U.S. states, cities, and private companies have continued to push forward with climate action through initiatives like the “We Are Still In” campaign during the previous Trump administration, the U.S. pulling out of the 2015 Paris accord would be a major setback for global climate goals. As the world’s largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases and the second-largest current emitter, the U.S. must play an active role in mitigation efforts to achieve a carbon-neutral future.Climate experts are concerned that Trump’s return could undermine efforts to meet global climate targets. Trump has openly criticized Biden’s climate initiatives, including the IRA, and experts fear that his rollback of these policies would halt crucial progress on emission reduction and clean energy investments.Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the UNFCCC, remarked, \"The result from this election will be seen as a major blow to global climate action, but it cannot and will not halt the changes underway to decarbonize the economy and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement... Clean energy technologies will continue to outcompete fossil fuels, not just because they are healthier, faster, cleaner and more abundant, but because they undercut fossil fuels where they are at their weakest: their unsolvable volatility and inefficiency.\"The timing of Trump’s victory—just days before COP29—could dampen the spirit of negotiations, especially as U.S. negotiators, still reeling from the political shift, may lack the mandate or political will to push forward on key issues. “COP29 in Baku is going to start under a very challenging political context, one in which the U.S. will not have a mandate or political will,” said Aarti Khosla, director of Climate Trends. “This may create more impediments than solutions on contentious matters like trade and funding for climate action.”With Trump already signaling a potential rollback on U.S. climate finance commitments, securing sufficient funding for global climate initiatives such as the Green Climate Fund could prove difficult. The world needs at least $1 trillion annually for climate action, and the U.S. withdrawal could severely hinder efforts to mobilize that capital.Harjeet Singh, global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, expressed concern over the consequences for vulnerable communities: “Trump's victory is a profound blow to global climate justice and an alarming escalation of climate risk for the world’s most vulnerable communities. His push to ramp up fossil fuel production, disregard for international agreements, and refusal to provide climate finance will deepen the crisis, endangering lives and livelihoods—especially in regions least responsible for, yet most impacted by, climate change.”As COP29 begins under these uncertain political circumstances, the global community’s ability to effectively combat climate change may hinge on whether the U.S. continues to stand by its climate commitments or takes a step back under Trump’s leadership.2024 US Election Results Live: From Kamala Harris to Mark Zuckerberg: As Trump returns to White House, a look at who has he warned to prosecutePresident-elect Donald Trump is poised for a historic comeback as the 47th president of the United States, marking an unprecedented return to the White House after a tumultuous chapter in American politics. His victory comes after a fiercely contested election and a series of controversies, including his refusal to concede the previous election, the Capitol riot, multiple criminal convictions, and even two attempts on his life.Trump clinched the presidency after securing the necessary 270 electoral votes, with Wisconsin playing a pivotal role in his path to victory. Throughout his campaign, Trump repeatedly warned of his intent to investigate and potentially prosecute political rivals, especially left-wing Americans, if re-elected. His Democratic counterpart, Vice President Kamala Harris, had cautioned that a Trump return to power could result in unchecked presidential authority.In a recent appearance on Fox News, Trump referred to \"the enemy from within\" as a key threat, echoing a statement made earlier in an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan, where he claimed that internal enemies posed a greater danger than North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He also threatened to deploy the National Guard or military force if necessary to handle unrest related to Election Day.Trump has called for investigations into several prominent political figures, including Vice President Kamala Harris, President Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, and Republican Liz Cheney, a vocal critic of Trump. During a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump accused Harris of orchestrating \"the biggest crime story of our time\" regarding illegal border crossings, and he demanded her impeachment and prosecution. He also suggested military trials for Cheney and Obama.Trump's rhetoric has extended to the tech industry, where he has accused Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg of election interference, alleging that Zuckerberg suppressed damaging content about Joe Biden during the 2020 election. Trump's recent book also warned that Zuckerberg could face prison if involved in similar actions in the upcoming election.In addition, Trump has expressed intentions to investigate Google for allegedly promoting negative stories about him, a theme he has repeatedly posted about on his Truth Social platform.On the issue of protests, particularly those related to pro-Palestinian demonstrations, Trump proposed one-year imprisonment for individuals who disrespect the American flag. He also declared plans to restrict refugee settlement from \"terror-infested\" regions, particularly Gaza, and vowed to apprehend \"pro-Hamas thugs\" responsible for destructive activities, seemingly targeting university student demonstrators.As Trump embarks on this new chapter, his return to the White House promises to reshape both domestic and foreign policy, with a focus on security, political accountability, and aggressive stances on immigration and protest. The next four years could mark a dramatic shift in American governance and its relationship with the world.2024 US Election Results Live: Netanyahu and Trump discuss Iranian threat in post-election callIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former U.S. President Donald Trump held a phone conversation on Wednesday, during which Netanyahu congratulated Trump on his victory in the U.S. presidential election. According to a statement from Netanyahu’s office, the call was “warm and cordial.”The two leaders focused their discussion on \"the Iranian threat\" and expressed the importance of continued cooperation to ensure Israel's security. This conversation highlights the ongoing concerns over Iran’s influence in the region, which has been a major point of discussion for both Israel and the U.S. in recent years.Netanyahu’s office did not provide further details, but the tone of the call signals the strengthening of ties between the two leaders as Trump prepares for his return to the White House.2024 US Election Results Live: From opposite worlds to the White House - JD Vance and Usha Chilukuri's unlikely love storyThey came from different backgrounds, yet their paths converged in an extraordinary love story that led to the halls of power. JD Vance, the son of a drug-addicted mother, was raised by his grandmother in the poverty-stricken, drug-ridden town of Middletown, Ohio. Usha Chilukuri, on the other hand, was raised in San Diego, California, to model Indian immigrant parents—her father a mechanical engineer and her mother a marine molecular biologist.Vance’s early life was marked by struggle. He “almost failed in high school” and battled feelings of anger and resentment. Chilukuri, a “bookworm” and “genetic anomaly,” excelled academically, earning degrees from prestigious institutions like Yale and Cambridge. While Vance joined the Marine Corps and later graduated from Ohio State University, Chilukuri pursued a career in law, earning a stellar reputation as an attorney.But fate had different plans. The unlikely duo became classmates at Yale Law School, where they were assigned to work on a major writing project together. Their connection was instant. “We were friends first,” Chilukuri said, recounting the beginning of their relationship in front of a cheering crowd at the Republican National Convention in July. “That JD and I could meet, let alone fall in love and marry, is testament to this great country.”Now, three months later, Vance’s meteoric rise has landed him as the Vice President-elect of the United States, with Chilukuri by his side as the second lady—cementing India’s growing influence in American politics.Their journey to love, as chronicled in Vance’s bestselling memoir Hillbilly Elegy, was anything but predictable. Vance writes about his intense emotional connection to Chilukuri, describing how he thought about her constantly. “I was heartsick,” he admits, noting that their relationship moved quickly after he learned she was single, despite the risks of rushing into romance.While Vance struggled with the unfamiliar world of Ivy League social norms and etiquette, Chilukuri guided him through the maze, teaching him everything from where to find the best coffee to navigating the complex hiring processes of prestigious law firms.Their relationship wasn’t without its challenges. In his memoir, Vance admits to withdrawing emotionally during conflicts and even storming out of hotel rooms after tense moments. However, after apologizing and learning the importance of communication, Vance and Chilukuri’s bond only grew stronger.Married in 2014, their intercultural, inter-faith relationship defied the odds. Even as Chilukuri was a registered Democrat at the time, their partnership thrived. At the Republican convention, Chilukuri humorously shared how her “meat and potatoes guy” husband adapted to her vegetarian diet and learned to cook Indian food for her mother—a testament to the lengths Vance was willing to go for love.Now, as Vance prepares to step into the White House, their love story continues to inspire, a reminder of how two people from vastly different worlds can come together to change history.2024 US Election Results Live: Trump’s victory signals increased scrutiny and potential H-1B visa challenges for tech firms and Indian diasporaAmerican companies brace for policy shifts, with stricter visa regulations expectedIn the wake of President Donald Trump’s stunning election victory, American companies, particularly those in the tech sector, are preparing for significant changes in immigration policy that could affect thousands of foreign workers. Over the past several days, companies have been consulting with immigration attorneys to assess the immediate impact of Trump’s return to the White House, which is expected to result in greater scrutiny for H-1B visa applications and extensions, including more Requests for Evidence (RFEs) and potential denials.The Trump administration’s approach to H-1B visas could bring a reintroduction of previously stalled policy changes. These changes would focus on ensuring that job positions qualify as specialty occupations and that a proper employer-employee relationship exists. The expected rise in RFEs and denials will challenge employers and foreign workers alike. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023, India accounted for over 72% of the total H-1B visa allotments, including initial applications and extensions, making the policy shifts particularly impactful for the Indian diaspora.Kripa Upadhyay, an immigration attorney, shared her concerns with TOI, stating, “During the last Trump administration, there was significant disruption due to the introduction of ‘extreme vetting’ for visa interviews. Certain job categories, such as ‘Computer Occupations, All Other,’ may no longer be an option, as they may require applicants to demonstrate specific technical skills and knowledge.”Impact on H-1B Visa extensionsOne of the most significant challenges under a second Trump administration will be for H-1B visa holders seeking extensions. H-1B visas are typically issued for a maximum of three years, with the possibility of a three-year extension. If the beneficiary is on a path to a green card, additional extensions are allowed. However, during Trump’s first term, the administration rescinded the \"deference policy,\" meaning that each extension application was treated as a new case, leading to increased uncertainty.Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group, explained, “We expect Trump will rescind the ‘deference policy’ again. If this happens, each extension application could face fresh scrutiny, leading to unpredictable outcomes for applicants.”Higher wages and stricter eligibility standardsAnother potential shift could involve policies targeting wage increases for H-1B workers and linking visa allotments to the highest salaries in specific occupations. This policy could severely impact international students, especially from India, who often transition from F-1 student visas to H-1B visas and typically start in lower salary ranges. Adam Cohen, partner at Siskind Susser immigration law firm, noted, “If a wage hike is announced for H-1B workers, it would badly impact international students.”A significant ruling in December 2020 saw a US district court strike down the Department of Labor’s attempt to impose wage hikes of up to 100% for H-1B workers. However, with Trump back in power, such measures could be reintroduced, raising concerns over their impact on both tech companies and foreign workers.Tech companies in focusMany Indian tech firms, such as Infosys and Wipro, which rely heavily on H-1B workers, may face heightened challenges under Trump’s policies, particularly when it comes to third-party placements. A previous rule targeting these placements was struck down by the court but could be revived by the Trump administration. Immigration attorney Ashwin Sharma noted, “Stricter H-1B eligibility criteria and increased paperwork, particularly for third-party placements, led to denials and RFEs that complicated approvals. A second term would likely bring swift reinstatement of these policies.”Global impact: workers to seek alternativesWith stricter H-1B policies, foreign workers may consider alternative routes, such as relocating to neighboring countries or even working remotely from India. The potential restrictions could also lead to higher filing fees, longer processing times, and a tougher visa lottery system. Charles H. Kuck, an immigration attorney, summarized the outlook: “Prepare for major H-1B changes: a lottery based on wages, higher filing fees, and stricter enforcement against job shops. Expect higher denial rates, longer processing times, no immigration reform, no increase in green card allotments, and no changes to the 7% per-country limit.”As the H-1B visa window opens in March, American employers and foreign workers, especially from India, will be keeping a close eye on the new policies set to take shape under President Trump’s administration.US Election Results 2024 Live: Trump poised for unprecedented power with GOP control of CongressUS President-elect Donald Trump stands on the verge of seizing unprecedented power in Washington, with his Republican Party on track to gain full control of Congress. If Republicans succeed in maintaining control of the House of Representatives, coupled with their already secured dominance of the Senate, Trump’s victory in the presidential race would mark the beginning of a GOP trifecta—unified control of the White House, Senate, and House. This would enable Trump to push his legislative agenda with unrivaled support and make pivotal judicial appointments to the US Supreme Court.As the latest election results pour in, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson confidently declared that Republicans are poised for a unified government. “As more results come in, it is clear that, as we have predicted all along, Republicans are poised to have unified government in the White House, Senate, and House,” he stated early Wednesday.According to the Cook Political Report, which closely tracks congressional races, a Republican trifecta remains the most likely outcome, with a narrow GOP majority in the House. Currently, Republicans hold 198 seats in the House, just 20 shy of the 218 needed to secure a majority, while Democrats have captured 180. Despite ongoing challenges in several districts, the trend points toward a GOP-controlled House.Republicans expand senate majority, Trump’s judicial influence growsOn the Senate front, Republicans have already flipped key seats, signaling a shift in control. Republican Jim Justice, the governor of West Virginia, triumphed in his race to replace retiring moderate Democrat Joe Manchin. Similarly, in Ohio, Trump-backed businessman Bernie Moreno unseated longtime Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, further boosting Republican numbers. Fox News and ABC quickly called the race for Republican control of the Senate after Senator Deb Fischer successfully fended off a strong independent challenge in Nebraska.With these victories, Republicans have reversed the Democrats' slim 51-49 majority, extending their lead with additional wins in Montana and potentially Nevada and Pennsylvania. If Republicans manage to secure all remaining toss-up races, they could end up with 55 Senate seats, giving them significant power to enact Trump’s domestic policies and push through judicial nominations.Historic firsts and a changing political landscapeIn the Senate, two Black women—Angela Alsobrooks and Lisa Blunt Rochester—are set to make history as they serve together, representing Maryland and Delaware, respectively. They will join Kamala Harris as the third and fourth Black women ever to serve in the Senate, marking a significant moment in US political history.Meanwhile, the election has also seen breakthroughs in representation. Sarah McBride made history as the first openly transgender politician elected to Congress, after defeating Republican John Whalen III for a House seat in Delaware.Looking ahead: A new era for Trump and the GOPWith the GOP on the cusp of controlling all branches of government, President-elect Trump is positioned to have an unprecedented level of influence. The path is clear for him to pursue a more aggressive domestic legislative agenda, appoint conservative judges to the Supreme Court, and potentially reshape America’s foreign and domestic policies.However, as the final votes are counted and the new Congress takes shape, the nation watches closely to see how Trump’s administration will navigate the new landscape—where his party’s unifying control may offer both unparalleled power and political risks.US Election Results 2024: India braces for Trump’s return to the White House: Relief on some fronts, apprehension on othersAs Donald Trump returns to the White House for a second term, India appears largely unaffected by the change of leadership in Washington, thanks to the bipartisan consensus supporting strong U.S.-India relations. However, there is a palpable sense of both relief and cautious optimism in New Delhi, particularly given the past rapport between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump during the latter’s first term. While the prospect of a Trump administration offers opportunities for enhanced bilateral ties, India remains wary of several challenges on the horizon.A warm reception for Trump, especially on RussiaOne of the most significant areas of relief for India will be Trump’s stance on Russia. Under the Biden administration, India had to carefully navigate its relations with Moscow, avoiding alienation from Washington due to growing anti-Russia sentiment in the U.S. Trump’s more cordial relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin will ease India’s concerns. His approach is expected to provide more flexibility for India in balancing its relations with both Russia and the United States.A welcome shift on human rights and religious freedomAnother area where India anticipates greater comfort is the lack of pressure on human rights and religious freedoms. While the Biden administration has been vocal in its criticism of India’s policies on these fronts, Trump’s administration has been less inclined to issue such lectures, which will be welcomed by hardliners within India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Shalli Kumar, a prominent Trump supporter who introduced him to Hindu revivalism in 2015, expressed optimism: \"The country finally spoke. Clear victory... This is the most fabulous Diwali gift for Hindus worldwide, Bharat, PM Modi, and citizens of the United States.\"Trade and tariffs: A potential flashpointHowever, Trump’s aggressive trade policies pose a potential point of friction for India. Known for his \"America First\" mantra, Trump’s approach to trade often involves reciprocal tariffs and public confrontations, a strategy that could ruffle feathers in New Delhi, which prefers to handle trade matters more discreetly. While Modi may be well-versed in handling such tensions, India will have to carefully manage trade negotiations to avoid any unnecessary escalation.Geo-Politics: A double-edged sword for IndiaOn the geopolitical front, Trump’s tough stance on China is likely to resonate with India, which shares border tensions with its neighbor. However, India must also be mindful of Trump’s aggressive push for reshoring manufacturing back to the U.S., a move that could affect India’s growing manufacturing sector as it benefits from businesses relocating from China.India will also be cautious about Trump’s stance on immigration. While he has expressed support for legal immigration, his hardline base is known for opposing even skilled immigration, including the H1B visa program, which many Indian professionals rely on. Furthermore, Trump's focus on illegal immigration could lead to an uptick in deportations of undocumented Indian immigrants.Unpredictability in foreign policyPerhaps the biggest concern for India is Trump’s unpredictability in foreign policy. His past comments, such as offering to mediate the Kashmir issue in 2019—despite India’s firm stance against third-party involvement—illustrate his tendency to make rash statements that can lead to diplomatic headaches. India will be keen to ensure that such missteps are avoided, especially as Trump’s second term could see further attempts to stir the geopolitical pot in the South Asian region.Global impact: A mixed bagWhile India has the diplomatic acumen to navigate Trump’s second term, many other nations may find his return more challenging. Ukraine, for instance, could face a reduced level of US support as Trump has expressed skepticism about continued military aid. Similarly, Taiwan may need to rethink its security strategy as Trump has suggested that the US would require “protection money” to defend the island from China. NATO allies, too, will likely find themselves reassessing their relationship with the US under Trump’s leadership.In conclusion, India’s relationship with the US during Trump’s second term will be marked by a blend of opportunity and caution. While there are clear advantages, particularly in terms of Russia and human rights, there are also areas of concern, especially on trade, immigration, and unpredictable foreign policy decisions. India’s leadership will need to stay vigilant as they navigate the complexities of dealing with a volatile and unconventional Trump administration.US Election Results 2024: When will Kamala Harris give her concession speech?US Vice President Kamala Harris is set to concede defeat to Donald Trump in the presidential election, according to sources. Harris is expected to address the nation in a speech at 6 pm (2300 GMT) on Wednesday, marking the formal acknowledgment of Trump’s victory in the tightly contested race. The concession comes after days of uncertainty following the election results. Details of her remarks have not been disclosed, but it is anticipated that she will offer a message of unity and resilience to the American people.US Election Results Live: Russia open to \"constructive dialogue\" with Trump administration - KremlinAs Donald Trump secured his second term as President of the United States, Russia expressed openness to engaging in a \"constructive dialogue\" with the incoming administration. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated on Wednesday that President Vladimir Putin remains ready to engage with the U.S., but the future of U.S.-Russia relations will depend on the stance taken by Washington once Trump takes office in January 2025.Peskov emphasized that Putin has consistently expressed a desire for dialogue based on justice, equality, and mutual respect. However, he noted that the current U.S. administration holds a contrary position, leaving the situation uncertain until Trump’s inauguration.\"Let's wait and see what happens in January,\" Peskov said, acknowledging that relations between the two nations are at their lowest point in history. He also refrained from commenting on Putin's reaction to the election results, citing ongoing reports from Washington.Trump, who crossed the 270 electoral votes threshold with a victory in Wisconsin, remains committed to a foreign policy that could significantly impact relations with Russia. The geopolitical future now hinges on whether the new administration will pursue a more cooperative or adversarial approach toward Moscow.US Election Results 2024 Live: Donald Trump wins historic comeback to become 47th US presidentDonald Trump has clinched the presidency for the second time, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in a highly charged election that cemented his political comeback after four tumultuous years. With a victory in Wisconsin, Trump surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to reclaim the White House, marking a stunning return for the former president.In his victory speech, Trump thanked the American people, promising to repay their support: \"This was something special, and we’re going to pay you back.\" He highlighted the record turnout and his support from voters who resonated with his combative rhetoric and promises of retribution.Trump's triumph also confirms his controversial political style, which resonates with a deeply polarized electorate. Throughout the campaign, he employed a fiery narrative focusing on issues like crime, migration, and global instability, often framed in stark, apocalyptic terms. His hard-hitting attacks on Harris were characterized by deeply personal, and at times misogynistic, rhetoric, while his portrayal of America as a nation under siege struck a chord with voters, particularly men.Despite Harris’ initial surge and hopes for a break from the Biden administration, she struggled to convince voters of her leadership capabilities. As Trump prepares to re-enter the White House on January 20, 2025, he faces numerous challenges, from a polarized political climate to global crises.Trump’s comeback also marks another milestone in history—he is the first president convicted of a felony to be re-elected. Additionally, his vice president, 40-year-old Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will become the youngest person to hold the office of vice president.The outcome of the election also signals a change in the balance of power. With Republicans now controlling the Senate and the House still undecided, Trump’s plans for a sweeping agenda include drastic policy shifts aimed at reshaping the government and pursuing aggressive foreign and domestic policies.Trump’s victory comes after a highly contested and volatile political season, which included two assassination attempts, a change in the Democratic nomination, and ongoing legal battles. His victory solidifies his grip on the Republican Party, even as he faces a complex array of legal challenges that will likely continue to define his political future.As Trump prepares to begin his second term, he promises to enact a radical agenda, including large-scale deportations, heavy tariffs, and a zero-sum approach to international diplomacy that could redefine America’s role on the world stage.US Election Results Live: Trump begins process of selecting key cabinet and administration officials - Key contenders revealedAs Donald Trump gears up for his potential second term, the process of selecting his cabinet and other high-ranking officials is already underway. Key positions overseeing defense, intelligence, diplomacy, trade, immigration, and economic policymaking are in play, with several high-profile figures reportedly in the running. Here are some of the leading contenders for these influential roles.Economic LeadershipJamie Dimon – Potential Treasury SecretaryJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has been floated as a strong candidate for Treasury Secretary, although it's uncertain whether he would take the position. Known for opposing regulations by agencies like the Federal Reserve and SEC, Dimon advocates for their rollback. Despite his history of supporting Democratic candidates, he has privately expressed support for Kamala Harris and critiqued Trump's role in the January 6 Capitol attack.Scott Bessent – Potential Treasury SecretaryA former hedge fund investor and advisor to Trump, Scott Bessent is another contender for Treasury Secretary. Bessent’s economic views align closely with Trump’s preference for deregulation and tariffs as negotiating tools. He has praised Trump’s stance on economic nationalism.John Paulson – Potential Treasury SecretaryBillionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson, a major Trump donor, is also seen as a likely pick for Treasury Secretary. Paulson’s advocacy for tax cuts and deregulation aligns with Trump’s economic agenda. A prominent fundraiser for Trump, Paulson raised over $50 million for the former president’s campaign in April.Larry Kudlow – Potential Treasury SecretaryFox News personality Larry Kudlow, who served as director of the National Economic Council during Trump’s first term, is another name being discussed for Treasury Secretary. While privately skeptical of broad tariffs, Kudlow’s economic policies generally align with Trump’s, making him a potential candidate for a prominent economic post.Robert Lighthizer – Potential Treasury SecretaryA staunch trade skeptic, Robert Lighthizer, who served as U.S. trade representative during Trump’s first term, could make a return to the administration. Although Bessent and Paulson have stronger prospects, Lighthizer’s firm belief in tariffs and trade reform makes him an interesting outside contender.National Security \u0026 Foreign PolicyRichard Grenell – Potential National Security AdvisorA close confidant of Trump, Richard Grenell has been a key figure in Trump’s foreign policy team, having served as acting Director of National Intelligence and U.S. Ambassador to Germany. Known for his controversial foreign policy stances, Grenell could be a strong contender for National Security Advisor, a position not requiring Senate confirmation.Robert O'Brien – Potential Secretary of StateFormer National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien is another name in the mix for top diplomatic roles, including Secretary of State. A hawkish figure with strong ties to foreign leaders, O'Brien's support for military aid to Ukraine sets him apart from some of Trump’s other advisors.Bill Hagerty – Potential Secretary of StateTennessee Senator Bill Hagerty, who previously served as U.S. Ambassador to Japan, is a potential candidate for Secretary of State. With strong ties within the Republican Party, Hagerty is seen as a diplomatic figure who could easily secure Senate confirmation.Marco Rubio – Potential Secretary of StateFlorida Senator Marco Rubio, a long-time foreign policy player, is another prominent candidate for Secretary of State. Known for his stances on Latin American issues, Rubio shares Trump’s views on global diplomacy and could play a key role in the administration’s foreign policy.Defense \u0026 Homeland SecurityMike Waltz – Potential Defense SecretaryFlorida Congressman Mike Waltz, a former Army Green Beret, is considered a strong contender for Defense Secretary. Known for his hardline stance on China, Waltz’s military background and political experience make him a top pick for national security positions.Mike Pompeo – Potential Defense SecretaryFormer CIA Director and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, another key figure in Trump’s first term, is a potential candidate for Defense Secretary. While Pompeo’s staunch defense of Ukraine may create tension within the Trump camp, his experience in national security roles makes him a contender for multiple high-ranking positions.Tom Cotton – Potential Defense SecretaryArkansas Senator Tom Cotton, a military hawk and Trump donor, is another possible pick for Defense Secretary. With a strong track record on defense and foreign policy, Cotton is considered a serious contender for a leadership role in the administration.Homeland Security \u0026 ImmigrationTom Homan – Potential Homeland Security SecretaryFormer acting ICE Director Tom Homan, a staunch advocate for strict immigration policies, is a likely candidate for Secretary of Homeland Security. Homan’s past work on immigration enforcement during Trump’s first term positions him as a key figure for a second-term Trump administration focused on cracking down on illegal immigration.Chad Wolf – Potential Homeland Security SecretaryChad Wolf, who served as acting Secretary of Homeland Security during Trump’s first term, is another name being considered. Despite controversy surrounding his appointment, Wolf’s loyalty to Trump’s hardline immigration policies makes him a strong contender for a return to DHS.Legal \u0026 IntelligenceJohn Ratcliffe – Potential Attorney GeneralFormer Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe is another name in the running for Attorney General. Known for his staunch loyalty to Trump, Ratcliffe has drawn both praise and criticism for his politicization of the intelligence role during his tenure.Mike Lee – Potential Attorney GeneralUtah Senator Mike Lee, a vocal supporter of Trump and a key figure in attempts to challenge the 2020 election results, is also a top contender for Attorney General. Lee’s strong stance on conservative legal policies makes him a likely pick for the position.Chief of StaffSusie Wiles – Potential Chief of StaffOne of Trump’s co-campaign managers, Susie Wiles is seen as a frontrunner for White House Chief of Staff. Known for her efficient and successful campaign management, Wiles could bring much-needed order and structure to the administration.Brooke Rollins – Potential Chief of StaffBrooke Rollins, former acting director of Trump’s Domestic Policy Council, is also a contender for Chief of Staff. Rollins is known for her close personal relationship with Trump and her moderate views on certain issues, including criminal justice reform.As Trump begins the process of assembling his administration, the names of these top contenders offer a glimpse into the direction his second term could take, with a focus on deregulation, economic nationalism, and hardline policies on defense, immigration, and national security.2024 US Election Results Live: Trump begins cabinet selection process: High-profile contenders emerge for key postsFollowing Donald Trump's presidential election victory, the process of selecting his cabinet and senior administration officials is underway, with top contenders emerging for crucial roles in defense, intelligence, diplomacy, trade, immigration, and economic policy. Here are some of the leading candidates for the key position of Treasury Secretary, with several high-profile figures in contention.Jamie DimonJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co., is seen as a prominent candidate for Treasury Secretary. Dimon, known for opposing regulatory constraints from agencies like the Federal Reserve and SEC, may push for regulatory rollbacks if appointed. However, Dimon’s appointment is uncertain, particularly given reports that he previously leaned towards supporting Harris due to concerns over Trump’s conduct around the January 6th events.Scott BessentHedge fund investor Scott Bessent, a Trump economic advisor with longstanding ties to the president-elect, is another top contender for the Treasury role. Known for his advocacy of free-market policies, Bessent has also praised Trump’s tactical use of tariffs and his economic philosophy, which emphasizes regulatory skepticism and protectionist trade measures. His economic vision aligns closely with Trump’s approach.John PaulsonBillionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson, a longtime Trump donor, has expressed interest in the Treasury role. Paulson, who hosted a high-profile fundraiser for Trump, has advocated for tax cuts, deregulation, and targeted tariffs as tools for national security and fair trade. His alignment with Trump’s economic policies makes him a strong contender.Larry KudlowLarry Kudlow, former National Economic Council Director and Fox News personality, is also in the mix, though he may be considered for other economic positions within the administration. While Kudlow has expressed reservations about sweeping tariffs, his economic stances largely mirror Trump’s, leaving the door open for a potential role in shaping economic policy.Trump’s selection process is expected to unfold in the coming weeks, as he seeks a team that aligns with his regulatory rollback agenda, economic nationalism, and preference for a strong stance on trade issues.2024 US Election Results Live: Trump’s unexpected comeback: How chaos and alliances led to a stunning win over HarrisIn the weeks following Kamala Harris' historic rise as the Democratic presidential nominee, Donald Trump’s advisors had a clear strategy in mind: stick to the issues that resonated with Americans. With polls indicating higher trust in Trump on matters like the economy and immigration, they urged him to avoid inflammatory rhetoric and stay focused.Trump, however, had different plans. As his third presidential campaign intensified, he veered away from scripted speeches and went on the offensive, making incendiary remarks and resorting to strongman tactics. Trump’s approach included personal attacks on Harris, harsh immigration stances, and a promise of retribution against rivals. Despite—or perhaps because of—his divergence from conventional campaign strategies, Trump clinched a stunning victory with 279 electoral votes to Harris’ 223 by early Wednesday morning.Sources close to the former president say his 2024 campaign was more disciplined than previous runs, with fewer leaks and a seasoned team of strategists. Yet, in the end, Trump’s bold moves and unapologetic style became the campaign’s defining force. More than 20 advisors, allies, and Republican insiders described to Reuters how Trump’s chaotic yet relentless approach ultimately prevailed.A crucial element of his win came from billionaire Elon Musk, who poured an estimated $119 million into Trump’s canvassing efforts across key battleground states. By focusing on immigration—where he had an edge over Democrats—rather than polarizing issues like abortion, Trump managed to align his campaign with voter concerns, securing a historical comeback as the first former president in over a century to reclaim the White House.Donald Trump’s unconventional campaign, laced with promises of political vengeance, criticisms of allies, and often extreme rhetoric, has carried him to a remarkable victory, marking his return to the White House. His campaign events were a mix of grievances, insults, and misinformation, yet they were punctuated by viral moments that showcased his everyman appeal—such as his casual stop at a McDonald’s drive-thru and an impromptu address from a garbage truck, both of which resonated powerfully online. Trump’s platform centered on tax cuts, reduced regulation, and historic import tariffs aimed at boosting U.S. manufacturing, despite warnings of rising consumer prices. His hard-charging style, peppered with foul language and stark imagery, rallied a loyal base who see him as a Washington outsider. His strong anti-immigration stance and focus on working-class frustrations with inflation further solidified support. Vice President Kamala Harris, entering the race in July to replace Biden, closed in on Trump through a centrist campaign that emphasized unity, abortion rights, and the threat Trump posed to democratic norms. Her message gained momentum, especially in fundraising, but ultimately, Trump’s appeal to frustrated voters delivered a decisive victory. Harris’s defeat ends her historic bid to become the first Black woman in the White House, as Trump’s polarizing yet effective campaign returns him to the Oval Office. Republicans claimed control of the US Senate, with decisive victories in Montana, Ohio, and West Virginia, guaranteeing they will hold at least one chamber of Congress. This outcome gives former President Donald Trump’s party a pathway to influence key legislative agendas and appointments for the upcoming term. While Republicans have won several critical House races, final control of the 435-seat chamber may not be confirmed for several days. Notable Republican gains include a Democratic-held district in Scranton, Pennsylvania—President Joe Biden’s hometown—and multiple seats in North Carolina following a Republican-led redistricting effort. Democrats, meanwhile, picked up a Republican-held seat in New York and another in Alabama after a Supreme Court order mandated the creation of a Black majority district. This election also marks a milestone as Democrats Lisa Blunt Rochester in Delaware and Angela Alsobrooks in Maryland will become the first two Black women to serve in the Senate simultaneously, reflecting broader diversity in the new Congress. Adding to the election’s historic outcomes, Delaware elected Democrat Sarah McBride, making her the first openly transgender member of Congress.",

Clean energy technologies will continue to outcompete fossil fuels, not just because they are healthier, faster, cleaner and more abundant, but because they undercut fossil fuels where they are at their weakest: their unsolvable volatility and inefficiency.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe timing of Trump’s victory—just days before COP29—could dampen the spirit of negotiations, especially as U.S. negotiators, still reeling from the political shift, may lack the mandate or political will to push forward on key issues. “COP29 in Baku is going to start under a very challenging political context, one in which the U.S. will not have a mandate or political will,” said Aarti Khosla, director of Climate Trends. “This may create more impediments than solutions on contentious matters like trade and funding for climate action.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Trump already signaling a potential rollback on U.S. climate finance commitments, securing sufficient funding for global climate initiatives such as the Green Climate Fund could prove difficult.

His push to ramp up fossil fuel production, disregard for international agreements, and refusal to provide climate finance will deepen the crisis, endangering lives and livelihoods—especially in regions least responsible for, yet most impacted by, climate change.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs COP29 begins under these uncertain political circumstances, the global community’s ability to effectively combat climate change may hinge on whether the U.S. continues to stand by its climate commitments or takes a step back under Trump’s leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e2024 US Election Results Live: From Kamala Harris to Mark Zuckerberg: As Trump returns to White House, a look at who has he warned to prosecute\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003ePresident-elect Donald Trump is poised for a historic comeback as the 47th president of the United States, marking an unprecedented return to the White House after a tumultuous chapter in American politics.

JD Vance, the son of a drug-addicted mother, was raised by his grandmother in the poverty-stricken, drug-ridden town of Middletown, Ohio. Usha Chilukuri, on the other hand, was raised in San Diego, California, to model Indian immigrant parents—her father a mechanical engineer and her mother a marine molecular biologist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVance’s early life was marked by struggle. He “almost failed in high school” and battled feelings of anger and resentment. Chilukuri, a “bookworm” and “genetic anomaly,” excelled academically, earning degrees from prestigious institutions like Yale and Cambridge. While Vance joined the Marine Corps and later graduated from Ohio State University, Chilukuri pursued a career in law, earning a stellar reputation as an attorney.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut fate had different plans. The unlikely duo became classmates at Yale Law School, where they were assigned to work on a major writing project together. Their connection was instant. “We were friends first,” Chilukuri said, recounting the beginning of their relationship in front of a cheering crowd at the Republican National Convention in July. “That JD and I could meet, let alone fall in love and marry, is testament to this great country.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, three months later, Vance’s meteoric rise has landed him as the Vice President-elect of the United States, with Chilukuri by his side as the second lady—cementing India’s growing influence in American politics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTheir journey to love, as chronicled in Vance’s bestselling memoir Hillbilly Elegy, was anything but predictable. Vance writes about his intense emotional connection to Chilukuri, describing how he thought about her constantly. “I was heartsick,” he admits, noting that their relationship moved quickly after he learned she was single, despite the risks of rushing into romance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Vance struggled with the unfamiliar world of Ivy League social norms and etiquette, Chilukuri guided him through the maze, teaching him everything from where to find the best coffee to navigating the complex hiring processes of prestigious law firms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTheir relationship wasn’t without its challenges. In his memoir, Vance admits to withdrawing emotionally during conflicts and even storming out of hotel rooms after tense moments. However, after apologizing and learning the importance of communication, Vance and Chilukuri’s bond only grew stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMarried in 2014, their intercultural, inter-faith relationship defied the odds. Even as Chilukuri was a registered Democrat at the time, their partnership thrived. At the Republican convention, Chilukuri humorously shared how her “meat and potatoes guy” husband adapted to her vegetarian diet and learned to cook Indian food for her mother—a testament to the lengths Vance was willing to go for love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, as Vance prepares to step into the White House, their love story continues to inspire, a reminder of how two people from vastly different worlds can come together to change history.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e2024 US Election Results Live: Trump’s victory signals increased scrutiny and potential H-1B visa challenges for tech firms and Indian diaspora\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmerican companies brace for policy shifts, with stricter visa regulations expected\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the wake of President Donald Trump’s stunning election victory, American companies, particularly those in the tech sector, are preparing for significant changes in immigration policy that could affect thousands of foreign workers. Over the past several days, companies have been consulting with immigration attorneys to assess the immediate impact of Trump’s return to the White House, which is expected to result in greater scrutiny for H-1B visa applications and extensions, including more Requests for Evidence (RFEs) and potential denials.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Trump administration’s approach to H-1B visas could bring a reintroduction of previously stalled policy changes. These changes would focus on ensuring that job positions qualify as specialty occupations and that a proper employer-employee relationship exists. The expected rise in RFEs and denials will challenge employers and foreign workers alike. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023, India accounted for over 72% of the total H-1B visa allotments, including initial applications and extensions, making the policy shifts particularly impactful for the Indian diaspora.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKripa Upadhyay, an immigration attorney, shared her concerns with TOI, stating, “During the last Trump administration, there was significant disruption due to the introduction of ‘extreme vetting’ for visa interviews. Certain job categories, such as ‘Computer Occupations, All Other,’ may no longer be an option, as they may require applicants to demonstrate specific technical skills and knowledge.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eImpact on H-1B Visa extensions\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most significant challenges under a second Trump administration will be for H-1B visa holders seeking extensions. H-1B visas are typically issued for a maximum of three years, with the possibility of a three-year extension. If the beneficiary is on a path to a green card, additional extensions are allowed. However, during Trump’s first term, the administration rescinded the \u0026#34;deference policy,\u0026#34; meaning that each extension application was treated as a new case, leading to increased uncertainty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSnehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group, explained, “We expect Trump will rescind the ‘deference policy’ again. If this happens, each extension application could face fresh scrutiny, leading to unpredictable outcomes for applicants.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHigher wages and stricter eligibility standards\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother potential shift could involve policies targeting wage increases for H-1B workers and linking visa allotments to the highest salaries in specific occupations. This policy could severely impact international students, especially from India, who often transition from F-1 student visas to H-1B visas and typically start in lower salary ranges. Adam Cohen, partner at Siskind Susser immigration law firm, noted, “If a wage hike is announced for H-1B workers, it would badly impact international students.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA significant ruling in December 2020 saw a US district court strike down the Department of Labor’s attempt to impose wage hikes of up to 100% for H-1B workers. However, with Trump back in power, such measures could be reintroduced, raising concerns over their impact on both tech companies and foreign workers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTech companies in focus\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany Indian tech firms, such as Infosys and Wipro, which rely heavily on H-1B workers, may face heightened challenges under Trump’s policies, particularly when it comes to third-party placements. A previous rule targeting these placements was struck down by the court but could be revived by the Trump administration. Immigration attorney Ashwin Sharma noted, “Stricter H-1B eligibility criteria and increased paperwork, particularly for third-party placements, led to denials and RFEs that complicated approvals. A second term would likely bring swift reinstatement of these policies.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGlobal impact: workers to seek alternatives\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith stricter H-1B policies, foreign workers may consider alternative routes, such as relocating to neighboring countries or even working remotely from India. The potential restrictions could also lead to higher filing fees, longer processing times, and a tougher visa lottery system. Charles H. Kuck, an immigration attorney, summarized the outlook: “Prepare for major H-1B changes: a lottery based on wages, higher filing fees, and stricter enforcement against job shops. Expect higher denial rates, longer processing times, no immigration reform, no increase in green card allotments, and no changes to the 7% per-country limit.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the H-1B visa window opens in March, American employers and foreign workers, especially from India, will be keeping a close eye on the new policies set to take shape under President Trump’s administration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eUS Election Results 2024 Live: Trump poised for unprecedented power with GOP control of Congress\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eUS President-elect Donald Trump stands on the verge of seizing unprecedented power in Washington, with his Republican Party on track to gain full control of Congress. If Republicans succeed in maintaining control of the House of Representatives, coupled with their already secured dominance of the Senate, Trump’s victory in the presidential race would mark the beginning of a GOP trifecta—unified control of the White House, Senate, and House. This would enable Trump to push his legislative agenda with unrivaled support and make pivotal judicial appointments to the US Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the latest election results pour in, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson confidently declared that Republicans are poised for a unified government. “As more results come in, it is clear that, as we have predicted all along, Republicans are poised to have unified government in the White House, Senate, and House,” he stated early Wednesday.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to the Cook Political Report, which closely tracks congressional races, a Republican trifecta remains the most likely outcome, with a narrow GOP majority in the House. Currently, Republicans hold 198 seats in the House, just 20 shy of the 218 needed to secure a majority, while Democrats have captured 180. Despite ongoing challenges in several districts, the trend points toward a GOP-controlled House.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRepublicans expand senate majority, Trump’s judicial influence grows\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the Senate front, Republicans have already flipped key seats, signaling a shift in control. Republican Jim Justice, the governor of West Virginia, triumphed in his race to replace retiring moderate Democrat Joe Manchin. Similarly, in Ohio, Trump-backed businessman Bernie Moreno unseated longtime Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, further boosting Republican numbers. Fox News and ABC quickly called the race for Republican control of the Senate after Senator Deb Fischer successfully fended off a strong independent challenge in Nebraska.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith these victories, Republicans have reversed the Democrats\u0026#39; slim 51-49 majority, extending their lead with additional wins in Montana and potentially Nevada and Pennsylvania. If Republicans manage to secure all remaining toss-up races, they could end up with 55 Senate seats, giving them significant power to enact Trump’s domestic policies and push through judicial nominations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHistoric firsts and a changing political landscape\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the Senate, two Black women—Angela Alsobrooks and Lisa Blunt Rochester—are set to make history as they serve together, representing Maryland and Delaware, respectively. They will join Kamala Harris as the third and fourth Black women ever to serve in the Senate, marking a significant moment in US political history.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the election has also seen breakthroughs in representation. Sarah McBride made history as the first openly transgender politician elected to Congress, after defeating Republican John Whalen III for a House seat in Delaware.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLooking ahead: A new era for Trump and the GOP\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the GOP on the cusp of controlling all branches of government, President-elect Trump is positioned to have an unprecedented level of influence.

However, there is a palpable sense of both relief and cautious optimism in New Delhi, particularly given the past rapport between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump during the latter’s first term. While the prospect of a Trump administration offers opportunities for enhanced bilateral ties, India remains wary of several challenges on the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA warm reception for Trump, especially on Russia\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most significant areas of relief for India will be Trump’s stance on Russia. Under the Biden administration, India had to carefully navigate its relations with Moscow, avoiding alienation from Washington due to growing anti-Russia sentiment in the U.S. Trump’s more cordial relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin will ease India’s concerns. His approach is expected to provide more flexibility for India in balancing its relations with both Russia and the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA welcome shift on human rights and religious freedom\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother area where India anticipates greater comfort is the lack of pressure on human rights and religious freedoms. While the Biden administration has been vocal in its criticism of India’s policies on these fronts, Trump’s administration has been less inclined to issue such lectures, which will be welcomed by hardliners within India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShalli Kumar, a prominent Trump supporter who introduced him to Hindu revivalism in 2015, expressed optimism: \u0026#34;The country finally spoke.

Known for his \u0026#34;America First\u0026#34; mantra, Trump’s approach to trade often involves reciprocal tariffs and public confrontations, a strategy that could ruffle feathers in New Delhi, which prefers to handle trade matters more discreetly. While Modi may be well-versed in handling such tensions, India will have to carefully manage trade negotiations to avoid any unnecessary escalation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGeo-Politics: A double-edged sword for India\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the geopolitical front, Trump’s tough stance on China is likely to resonate with India, which shares border tensions with its neighbor. However, India must also be mindful of Trump’s aggressive push for reshoring manufacturing back to the U.S., a move that could affect India’s growing manufacturing sector as it benefits from businesses relocating from China.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIndia will also be cautious about Trump’s stance on immigration. While he has expressed support for legal immigration, his hardline base is known for opposing even skilled immigration, including the H1B visa program, which many Indian professionals rely on. Furthermore, Trump\u0026#39;s focus on illegal immigration could lead to an uptick in deportations of undocumented Indian immigrants.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnpredictability in foreign policy\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the biggest concern for India is Trump’s unpredictability in foreign policy. His past comments, such as offering to mediate the Kashmir issue in 2019—despite India’s firm stance against third-party involvement—illustrate his tendency to make rash statements that can lead to diplomatic headaches. India will be keen to ensure that such missteps are avoided, especially as Trump’s second term could see further attempts to stir the geopolitical pot in the South Asian region.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGlobal impact: A mixed bag\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile India has the diplomatic acumen to navigate Trump’s second term, many other nations may find his return more challenging. Ukraine, for instance, could face a reduced level of US support as Trump has expressed skepticism about continued military aid. Similarly, Taiwan may need to rethink its security strategy as Trump has suggested that the US would require “protection money” to defend the island from China. NATO allies, too, will likely find themselves reassessing their relationship with the US under Trump’s leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, India’s relationship with the US during Trump’s second term will be marked by a blend of opportunity and caution. While there are clear advantages, particularly in terms of Russia and human rights, there are also areas of concern, especially on trade, immigration, and unpredictable foreign policy decisions. India’s leadership will need to stay vigilant as they navigate the complexities of dealing with a volatile and unconventional Trump administration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eUS Election Results 2024: When will Kamala Harris give her concession speech?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUS Vice President Kamala Harris is set to concede defeat to Donald Trump in the presidential election, according to sources.

With a victory in Wisconsin, Trump surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to reclaim the White House, marking a stunning return for the former president.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn his victory speech, Trump thanked the American people, promising to repay their support: \u0026#34;This was something special, and we’re going to pay you back.\u0026#34; He highlighted the record turnout and his support from voters who resonated with his combative rhetoric and promises of retribution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump\u0026#39;s triumph also confirms his controversial political style, which resonates with a deeply polarized electorate. Throughout the campaign, he employed a fiery narrative focusing on issues like crime, migration, and global instability, often framed in stark, apocalyptic terms. His hard-hitting attacks on Harris were characterized by deeply personal, and at times misogynistic, rhetoric, while his portrayal of America as a nation under siege struck a chord with voters, particularly men.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite Harris’ initial surge and hopes for a break from the Biden administration, she struggled to convince voters of her leadership capabilities. As Trump prepares to re-enter the White House on January 20, 2025, he faces numerous challenges, from a polarized political climate to global crises.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump’s comeback also marks another milestone in history—he is the first president convicted of a felony to be re-elected. Additionally, his vice president, 40-year-old Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will become the youngest person to hold the office of vice president.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe outcome of the election also signals a change in the balance of power.

His victory solidifies his grip on the Republican Party, even as he faces a complex array of legal challenges that will likely continue to define his political future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Trump prepares to begin his second term, he promises to enact a radical agenda, including large-scale deportations, heavy tariffs, and a zero-sum approach to international diplomacy that could redefine America’s role on the world stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eUS Election Results Live: Trump begins process of selecting key cabinet and administration officials - Key contenders revealed\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Donald Trump gears up for his potential second term, the process of selecting his cabinet and other high-ranking officials is already underway.

With polls indicating higher trust in Trump on matters like the economy and immigration, they urged him to avoid inflammatory rhetoric and stay focused.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump, however, had different plans. As his third presidential campaign intensified, he veered away from scripted speeches and went on the offensive, making incendiary remarks and resorting to strongman tactics. Trump’s approach included personal attacks on Harris, harsh immigration stances, and a promise of retribution against rivals. Despite—or perhaps because of—his divergence from conventional campaign strategies, Trump clinched a stunning victory with 279 electoral votes to Harris’ 223 by early Wednesday morning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSources close to the former president say his 2024 campaign was more disciplined than previous runs, with fewer leaks and a seasoned team of strategists. Yet, in the end, Trump’s bold moves and unapologetic style became the campaign’s defining force. More than 20 advisors, allies, and Republican insiders described to Reuters how Trump’s chaotic yet relentless approach ultimately prevailed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA crucial element of his win came from billionaire Elon Musk, who poured an estimated $119 million into Trump’s canvassing efforts across key battleground states. By focusing on immigration—where he had an edge over Democrats—rather than polarizing issues like abortion, Trump managed to align his campaign with voter concerns, securing a historical comeback as the first former president in over a century to reclaim the White House.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eDonald Trump’s unconventional campaign, laced with promises of political vengeance, criticisms of allies, and often extreme rhetoric, has carried him to a remarkable victory, marking his return to the White House. His campaign events were a mix of grievances, insults, and misinformation, yet they were punctuated by viral moments that showcased his everyman appeal—such as his casual stop at a McDonald’s drive-thru and an impromptu address from a garbage truck, both of which resonated powerfully online.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\nTrump’s platform centered on tax cuts, reduced regulation, and historic import tariffs aimed at boosting U.S. manufacturing, despite warnings of rising consumer prices. His hard-charging style, peppered with foul language and stark imagery, rallied a loyal base who see him as a Washington outsider. His strong anti-immigration stance and focus on working-class frustrations with inflation further solidified support.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\nVice President Kamala Harris, entering the race in July to replace Biden, closed in on Trump through a centrist campaign that emphasized unity, abortion rights, and the threat Trump posed to democratic norms. Her message gained momentum, especially in fundraising, but ultimately, Trump’s appeal to frustrated voters delivered a decisive victory. Harris’s defeat ends her historic bid to become the first Black woman in the White House, as Trump’s polarizing yet effective campaign returns him to the Oval Office.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\nRepublicans claimed control of the US Senate, with decisive victories in Montana, Ohio, and West Virginia, guaranteeing they will hold at least one chamber of Congress.

Notable Republican gains include a Democratic-held district in Scranton, Pennsylvania—President Joe Biden’s hometown—and multiple seats in North Carolina following a Republican-led redistricting effort. Democrats, meanwhile, picked up a Republican-held seat in New York and another in Alabama after a Supreme Court order mandated the creation of a Black majority district.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\nThis election also marks a milestone as Democrats Lisa Blunt Rochester in Delaware and Angela Alsobrooks in Maryland will become the first two Black women to serve in the Senate simultaneously, reflecting broader diversity in the new Congress.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\nAdding to the election’s historic outcomes, Delaware elected Democrat Sarah McBride, making her the first openly transgender member of Congress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
