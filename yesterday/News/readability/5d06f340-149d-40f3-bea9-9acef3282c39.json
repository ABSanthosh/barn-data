Displaced workers will be able to apply for other jobs internally, the person added. A representative of San Francisco-based Salesforce declined to comment.

Technology companies have grown more accustomed to regular job reductions after a massive wave of layoffs at the start of 2023. So far this year, Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. have all moved to trim their corporate workforces. Salesforce, the leading maker of customer management software, has embarked on a hiring spree for salespeople focused on the company’s new AI agent products. But it’s also been keeping a closer eye on maintaining profit margins after pressure from activist investors in 2023.

How can we continue to get fuel for the work that we’re doing to go invest in scale going forward?” Salesforce is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings around the end of February.
