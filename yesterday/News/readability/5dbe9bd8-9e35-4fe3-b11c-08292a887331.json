  "text": "When Pakistani officials last week told Beijing’s diplomats that its Chinese-made jets and missiles had downed several Indian aircraft, including French warplanes, the response was quiet jubilation. After many years and billions spent in development, their arms were finally tested in battle — and delivered.But the focus quickly shifted from elation to escalation, according to two people familiar with official Chinese discussions.As cross-border fighting raged last week, a flurry of meetings were already underway in both Islamabad and Beijing, with Chinese diplomats scrambling to assess the potential fallout. Among their concerns was that any overt display of China’s battlefield success could shatter its fragile détente with India — just as Beijing is trying to present itself as a stabilizing force in Asia in contrast to Washington’s volatility.This week, Chinese officials and state media struck a careful tone, touting the success of Beijing’s military technology while urging restraint between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, who have held to a ceasefire since Sunday. But outside official channels, China’s tightly controlled social media has erupted with nationalist fervor over its apparently successful live combat test.New Delhi this week released new details drawing attention to the role of Chinese weaponry in the clash against Pakistani forces and pushed back against claims it bested Indian defenses. In a Wednesday statement, New Delhi claimed its forces had “bypassed and jammed Pakistan’s Chinese-supplied air defense systems” within just 23 minutes.The unease among Chinese officials — and the carefully calibrated messaging — underscores Beijing’s delicate role as a burgeoning proxy military power in South Asia, a region that could become the first true proving ground for its arsenal and its effectiveness against Western weaponry.“The situation is being managed very carefully in China. There is no doubt that [Beijing] wants to show … the strength of its military industry development, but it’s not the right time to be pulled into frivolous fights,” said one person in Beijing who was briefed on discussions between Chinese officials last week and who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.In Washington, President Donald Trump claimed a ceasefire — made before any official word from India or Pakistan — as a fleeting diplomatic win amid faltering efforts to broker peace in Ukraine and the Middle East. Washington has pushed back against Beijing’s expanding military ties with nuclear-armed Pakistan, raising concerns over regional stability and proliferation risks. Last September, the United States imposed sanctions on several Chinese firms that supply Pakistan’s ballistic missile program.China has deepened its economic and military ties with Pakistan in recent years, now supplying around 80 percent of its imported arms. The partnership serves to counterbalance India, which has had a long-standing border dispute with China. Chinese and Indian forces clashed in 2020 in the contested Galwan Valley, leading to deaths on both sides, and only last year did the two sides agree to a de-escalating joint patrolling agreement.Beijing remains cautious about pushing New Delhi too far. When relations soured following the Galwan Valley clashes, Washington moved quickly to draw India closer into the coalition of nations countering China’s growing influence in Asia. At a 2022 White House meeting, President Joe Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi signed a deal to co-produce fighter jet engines in India, declaring the two nations “among the closest partners in the world.”Indian officials have pushed back on elements of Trump’s account of the Kashmir ceasefire. Still, analysts say New Delhi remains constrained by the need to finalize a trade deal within the 90-day negotiating window. On Thursday, Trump claimed India had offered a deal with “no tariffs” on American goods.“For China, India is a very important relationship, even though they’re competitors. It does not want to push India further into the U.S. orbit,” said Nishank Motwani, a senior fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.China has poured trillions of dollars into building a high-tech military it hopes will rival that of the United States in the coming decades — but has had few opportunities to battle-test those investments. The mounting evidence that Chinese jets may have downed modern French-made aircraft likely comes as a relief to Beijing.“If Pakistan’s equipment were to fail, that is egg in the face of the Chinese,” said Milan Vaishnav, senior fellow and director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.India last week launched a missile attack on Pakistani targets in retaliation for the April 22 killing of 26 mostly Hindu tourists in Kashmir, a border region claimed by both countries. India accused Pakistan of supporting the attackers, which Islamabad has denied.Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Parliament following the skirmish that five Indian warplanes were shot down by Chinese J-10C jets and that Chinese diplomats were kept abreast of the unfolding situation. “Being a friendly nation, they expressed great happiness,” he said, in comments reported by Pakistani media. New Delhi has not confirmed that any of its aircraft were lost, but at a Monday news conference, officials showed images of what appeared to be debris from PL-15E Chinese air-to-air missiles.If confirmed, the clashes would mark the first real battlefield use of both the Chinese-made J-10C and the PL-15E missiles reportedly recovered by Indian forces.According to a Washington Post analysis, the Indian retaliatory strikes damaged runways and infrastructure at at least six military airfields — the most significant combat exchange in decades between the rival nations, which have fought two wars over the region since 1947.Trump announced last Saturday that the two sides had reached a ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States following a “long night of talks.” On Monday he said the agreement was struck after his administration said it “wouldn’t do any trade” with the two sides if they didn’t stop fighting. Indian officials have since denied trade was discussed at all and disputed that Washington played a significant role in the ceasefire.In 2021, Pakistan became the first known foreign buyer of China’s J-10C fighter jets. Debuting at Pakistan’s National Day parade in 2022, the jets have featured in at least one cross-border mission over Iran last year but had never seen combat.Analysts say the skirmish likely offered Beijing more than a combat test of its jets and missiles — it also gave a window into India’s military readiness, including its use of drones and intelligence capabilities that enabled precision strikes inside Pakistan.“This is the first time also India’s been using offensive capability drones, for example … and then at the same time, what it is doing in terms of electronic warfare and jamming to down Pakistani assets,” Motwani said. “China will be learning a lot. For its own benefit vis-à-vis India, and at the same time when the dust has settled, Pakistan will be sharing that intel as well with China.”The showdown between Chinese and French-made jets also offers the United States and its allies a rare opportunity to assess the potential performance of Chinese fighters in the Indo-Pacific theater.The J-10 is common in the Chinese military’s sorties over Taiwan and the South China Sea, and has been deployed to intercept U.S. military aircraft. Last year, Australia raised protests with Chinese counterparts after a J-10C fighter jet launched flares in front of an Australian military helicopter that was accompanying an Australian destroyer in the Yellow Sea.Under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon has issued interim guidance that elevates a potential conflict over Taiwan above all other theaters, outlining plans to reorient the sprawling U.S. military apparatus toward the Indo-Pacific.Air superiority is likely to prove decisive in any conflict over the Taiwan Strait or the South China Sea. Last month, the U.S. approved a $5.58 billion deal to sell 20 F-16s to the Philippines — a key ally in countering China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific — prompting Beijing to accuse Washington of “turning Asia into a powder keg.”This week, Chinese analysts and social media commentators wasted no time linking the reported prowess of the Chinese fighter jets to a potential showdown with Taiwan.“The conflict between India and Pakistan is likely to be a rehearsal for the imminent collapse of Taiwan’s imported equipment,” said Hu Xijin, former editor in chief of the hawkish Chinese state media newspaper Global Times.",
