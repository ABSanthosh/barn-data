The election result is also part of a wider wave of popular discontent that has swelled across the continent, amid a lack of good jobs for growing youthful populations.“Although I wanted to stay on as your president, I respect the will of the people and I congratulate the president-elect. I will step aside and I will support the new administration,” Masisi said at a press conference on Friday morning, when only part of the results had been released.State television later showed that out of 55 of the 61 constituencies that had reported results, the UDC had won 32 seats, while the BDP was in last place out of four parties with just four seats. MPs will now elect the president.Boko, who had pledged to raise the minimum wage and increase social grants, told the local news outlet Mmegi: “It shocked me, the numbers … I’m humbled.”Botswana is the world’s second-largest diamond producer,. Income from the gems is credited with helping the country to be one of the region’s most stable and wealthy states.Nevertheless, a global slump in demand for diamonds has led to a sharp economic contraction: the IMF predicts economic growth of 1% this year, down from 2.7% in 2023 and 5.5% in 2022. Unemployment has risen to 28%, while more than a third of 15- to 35-year-olds are out of work.“The result was unexpected,” said Zoë McCathie, an analyst at Signal Risk. “Economic conditions in the country at the moment, specifically unemployment levels, have been a big factor.”Umbrella for Democratic Change supporters cheer in the streets in Gaborone.

Mozambique’s ruling Frelimo party was declared the winner of elections in October amid allegations that the results were rigged and killings of opposition figures.Reuters contributed to this story",
