  "text": "MOSCOW: Russia has labelled Yale University an \"undesirable organisation\", authorities said Tuesday, as the Kremlin pursues a crackdown on critics that has accelerated during Moscow's campaign in Ukraine.Being declared \"undesirable\" effectively bans entities from operating in Russia and makes anyone who works with them liable to prosecution.According to the prosecutor general, Yale's activities were aimed at \"violating territorial integrity of the Russian Federation, imposing an international blockade on the state and undermining its economic foundations.\"The prosecutors singled out Yale's School of Global Affairs, accusing it of preparing opposition activists to organise protests in the country.President Vladimir Putin's top contender, late opposition activist Alexei Navalny who died in prison in unclear circumstances in February 2024, was among the school's fellows. The US university joins international organisations and nonprofits such as Amnesty International, British Council, Greenpeace, Elton John's AIDS Foundation which Moscow has labelled as undesirable.Russia has also put on the list independent media outlets such as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Meduza.",
