  "text": "Three Palestinians were killed, including two children, in an Israeli airstrike in the West Bank on Wednesday, Palestinian officials said, as arrests, raids and strikes continued across the occupied territory in the wake of an attack that killed three Israelis on Monday. Late Wednesday, the al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas’s armed wing, claimed responsibility for the Monday attack in a statement on Telegram.Two boys, alongside an older relative, were killed in a drone strike in the town of Tamun, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. It identified the boys as Rida Bisharat, 9, and Hamza Bisharat, 10.The Palestinian Foreign Ministry called the attack that killed them a “heinous crime.” The Palestinian Health Ministry did not immediately confirm the deaths.The Israel Defense Forces said it “struck a terrorist cell” in the area, and that following reports that children had been killed, “the incident is under review.”Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered an increase in military activity after the shootings “to ensure the security of the settlements and settlers” in the occupied West Bank after the attack on Israelis. The IDF said Tuesday it was “pursuing the terrorists” who carried out the attack, but it has not released information about any suspects.The strike, in a period of sustained operations across the West Bank, was the second to hit Tamun in as many days.The Palestinian Prisoners’ Society said in a statement that at least 45 Palestinians, including a child and two women, were arrested by Israeli forces in the West Bank between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning.The statement said the widespread campaign of arrests, which it described as collective punishment, took place across Hebron, Nablus, Tubas, Tulkarm, Ramallah and Jerusalem.Here’s what else to knowAn Italian journalist arrested in Iran last month was released Wednesday after weeks of diplomatic wrangling between Rome and Tehran. Cecilia Sala, 29, landed at an airport in Rome on Wednesday. An image of Sala descending alone from a plane was published by her Italian outlet, Il Foglio.The Israel Defense Forces said late Tuesday that its warplanes conducted several strikes in Gaza’s Khan Younis area, striking Hamas militants who participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The strikes killed 18 people, Reuters reported, including several women and children.At least 51 people were killed in the Gaza Strip in the past day, the enclave’s Health Ministry said Wednesday, bringing the death toll to at least 45,936 since Oct. 7, 2023. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack, including more than 300 soldiers. It says 395 soldiers have been killed in its military operation in Gaza.Live coverage contributors 10Israel says body of hostage was recovered from tunnel in GazaReturn to menuIsraeli officials said Wednesday that they found the body of an Israeli hostage, Yousef Alziadna, 53, in Gaza and that they have “concern” about his son, Hamza Alziadna, 23, also a hostage.In a statement, Israeli military spokesman Nadav Shoshani said Yousef Alziadna’s body was found in a tunnel in southern Gaza on Tuesday. Shoshani also said soldiers found evidence related to Hamza Alziadna that led to “concern about his life.”The Israeli military declined to go into detail about Hamza Alziadna, citing procedures in place with health authorities and relatives.In a statement posted on X, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the bodies of both Yousef and Hamza have been found.The discovery came amid a renewed push for a ceasefire deal that could allow the release of hostages held in Gaza, the most since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel. A Hamas official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations, said the organization has agreed to the potential release of 34 people in the first phase of an agreement.Yousef Alziadna was included on the list of names for potential release. More than 90 hostages are believed to be in Gaza, though it is not clear how many are still alive. The Hamas official said the organization would not disclose which of the hostages are alive, citing the ongoing negotiations.“[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu wants to know that, but nothing comes free in negotiations,” the official said.The official said the inclusion of Israeli American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, was designed as a “significant message” that showed a “willingness to reach a comprehensive and integrated agreement.” Another American, Keith Siegel, 65, is also on the list of those being discussed for release, many of whom are men over age 50 or women.Four members of the Alziadna family were taken hostage from southern Israel’s Kibbutz Holit in the Hamas-led attack. Two — Bilal and Aisha, who are children of Yousef and siblings of Hamza — were freed in an earlier hostage deal. In a post on X, Netanyahu expressed “deep sorrow” that Yousef and Hamza could not also be “successfully brought back.”Lebanon pushes to elect president after years of political impasseReturn to menuBEIRUT — Lebanese lawmakers are set to try to elect a president Thursday, which would end years of political impasse in a time of turmoil. But whether the leading candidate has enough votes to succeed is an open question.Envoys from France and Saudi Arabia arrived in Beirut on Wednesday to meet with political leaders amid a growing diplomatic effort to push for a successful vote.As of Wednesday, Lebanon’s army commander, Gen. Joseph Aoun, appeared to remain the top contender for the job. Aoun is the U.S. favorite for the role, according to several people familiar with their discussions in Beirut. Earlier this week, he received support from a number of independent members of parliament.A successful election would fill a years-long political vacuum in a country still navigating a shaky truce that paused its deadliest conflict since the civil war that ended in 1990 — the November ceasefire that followed Israel’s invasion, amid its war with Hezbollah.One diplomat familiar with the talks ahead of the Thursday vote, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information, said that while there were “encouraging signs” that the parliamentary session could break more than two years of political paralysis, “we remain cautious, as we know anything could happen.”In Lebanon, lawmakers, not the general public, elect the president, who under an unwritten power-sharing agreement has to be a member of the Maronite Christian sect.If Lebanon’s parliament, deeply fractured along sectarian lines, is able to do so Thursday — on its 13th try — it would signal a willingness to enact some of the political reforms needed to unlock desperately sought postwar support from the United States and other foreign donors.Samir Geagea, the vehemently anti-Hezbollah leader of Lebanon’s largest Christian parliamentary bloc, signaled Tuesday that he would not reject Aoun’s candidacy.Some obstacles to his candidacy remain, including the question of support from Hezbollah and its allies, who form the bulk of the Shiite votes. Aoun would need some of that support to reach 86 votes, the number needed for a constitutional amendment to pass that would allow an active civil servant to assume the presidency.The attempt will be a first look at how a postwar Hezbollah intends to interact with domestic politics. The militant group, one of the most dominant forces in Lebanese politics, had previously been considered one of the main obstacles to the election of a president as the country passed through a string of upheavals, but it may now be showing some signs of flexibility.French envoy Jean-Yves Le Drian met Wednesday with a number of officials, including the country’s speaker of parliament and Hezbollah lawmakers. A statement from Hezbollah said the meeting was focused on the presidential election. Later in the day, in an encouraging sign, Hezbollah’s preferred candidate, former interior minister Suleiman Frangieh, said he withdrew his name from consideration and endorsed Aoun instead.Some E.U. Syria sanctions could be lifted quickly, says top French diplomatReturn to menuBEIRUT — The European Union could quickly lift some of the sanctions on Syria that are hampering humanitarian aid and the country’s ability to rebuild, France’s foreign minister said Wednesday.“There are sanctions targeting Bashar al-Assad and the executioners of his regime, there is clearly no intention to lift these sanctions,” Jean-Noël Barrot told France Inter radio station. “Then there are others which currently hinder access to humanitarian aid, which prevent the country’s recovery and these could be lifted quickly.”Syria’s war-wracked economy has suffocated under Assad-era sanctions since 2011. In their month in power, its new interim leaders have focused diplomatic efforts on urging Western governments and their allies to put an end to what they say is the biggest hurdle now to Syria’s recovery.“Finally, there are other sanctions, which we are discussing with our European partners, which could be lifted, but obviously depending on the pace at which our expectations for Syria regarding women and security are taken into account,” Barrot said. On Friday he traveled to Damascus alongside the German foreign minister to meet Ahmed al-Sharaa, Syria’s de facto new leader.Any easing of the sanctions would require a unanimous E.U. decision of the 27 member states. The next meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council is on Jan. 27.The question of sanctions and the level to which they cause unintended harm on civilians has plagued and divided Western policy decisions on Syria for years. It has been brought under fresh scrutiny since Assad fell.While the United States and the E.U. are supporting Syria’s political transition and recovery, they have so far expressed caution in regard to dropping all sanctions for the Islamist rebels who overthrew the Assad regime until they prove themselves to be inclusive to women, minorities and Syria’s myriad ethnic and religious groups.If passed, the E.U. sanction relief would follow a U.S. Treasury Department decision on Monday that issued a six-month sanctions exemption for transactions with Syrian governing institutions in a bid to ease the flow of humanitarian aid.Biden will defer to Trump on terror label for Syria’s Islamist leaders Return to menuThe Biden administration has decided to maintain the terrorist designation of Syria’s new Islamist rulers for the remainder of President Joe Biden’s tenure, leaving a critical decision about Hayʼat Tahrir al-Sham and its leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, to the incoming Trump administration, said three U.S. officials familiar with the matterThe terrorist designation for HTS is a key obstacle to Syria’s long-term economic viability, but U.S. officials said the Islamist rebels who stunned the world late last year by overthrowing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must demonstrate they have made a clean break with extremist groups, in particular al-Qaeda, before the label can be lifted.“Actions will speak louder than words,” said one senior U.S. official, noting Washington’s lingering concerns about the inclusion of foreign fighters and jihadists in positions within Syria’s Defense Ministry. The official, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive policy matter.President-elect Donald Trump has appointed hard-line critics of Islamic extremism to top White House jobs, including Sebastian Gorka for senior director for counterterrorism and Michael Waltz for national security adviser. Leaving the terrorist-designation decision to Trump is expected to substantially extend the timeline of powerful U.S. sanctions on Syria.This is an excerpt from a full story.Trump envoy says president-elect is ‘driving’ Gaza hostage talks Return to menuSteve Witkoff, President-elect Donald Trump’s designated Middle East special envoy, said Tuesday he has been in Qatar “working in tandem” with Biden administration negotiators on a last-ditch effort to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza.Trump, who brought Witkoff to the lectern during a news conference at his Palm Beach, Florida, residence, called his envoy a “great negotiator” and “what we needed over there.”In a wide-ranging news conference on Jan. 7, President-elect Donald Trump talked about a few of his priorities for his incoming presidential term. (Video: The Washington Post)Witkoff’s presence in Doha, the Qatari capital where negotiations are taking place, comes as Trump’s picks for foreign policy roles and the president-elect himself have skirted the line separating the outgoing and incoming administrations. Since his election, Trump has hosted several foreign government leaders at his Mar-a-Lago estate, including Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni over the weekend, and has roiled other bilateral relationships with insults and threats of tariffs or outright conquest.In remarks to reporters after Trump’s news conference, Witkoff emphasized that “the Biden administration is the tip of the spear” in the negotiations and is briefing him daily. President Joe Biden, he said, has “got a solid team, and I appreciated that they’re allowing us to be collaborative.” Witkoff said he will return to Doha on Wednesday.This is an excerpt from a full story.Trump says ‘all hell will break out’ if no hostage deal by inaugurationReturn to menuPresident-elect Donald Trump said in a news conference that “all hell will break out” and it will “not be good for Hamas” if a deal to release Israeli hostages held by the militant group is not done before his Jan. 20 inauguration.In response to Trump’s comments, Hamas official Osama Hamdan told reporters that “the U.S. president must make more disciplined and diplomatic statements,” Reuters reported.Steve Witkoff, Trump’s incoming Middle East envoy, told reporters that he has been in Qatar working with the Biden administration and that they are “on the verge” of a deal. Witkoff said he will return to Doha on Wednesday.Witkoff confirmed that the first phase of the three-phase deal in the Doha talks calls for the release of 34 hostages in stages over a 42-day ceasefire. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday denied subsequent reports that there would be a pause in fighting in exchange for a list of hostages and their locations.Middle East conflict The Israel-Gaza war has gone on for over a year, and tensions have spilled into the surrounding Middle East region.The war: On Oct. 7, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. We’re tracking how many hostages remain in Gaza. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel’s creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.Cease-fire: Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah agreed to a cease-fire deal in November 2024, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities. Here’s what to know about the deal’s terms and how it will be enforced.Hezbollah: Hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, a militant organization backed by Iran, have escalated over the past year, leading to an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon. Israel’s airstrikes into Lebanon have grown more intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel’s founding.Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century’s most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including President Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations’ cease-fire resolutions.Monitoring the status of hostages still in Gaza after Hamas’s attackAssad defends escape from Syria, blames ‘terrorist onslaught’ in first statementWar’s ebb in Lebanon leaves devastation and uncertain future",
