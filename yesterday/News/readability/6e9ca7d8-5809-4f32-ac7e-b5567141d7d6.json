  "text": "BEIRUT — The Hezbollah militant group formally buried its slain leader Hasan Nasrallah on Sunday, in a long-awaited ceremony that brought tens of thousands of the movement’s supporters out to mourn in Lebanon’s capital, Beirut.The elaborate funeral services, which packed a 50,000-seat stadium in the city’s southern suburbs, were part of an effort by Hezbollah to project strength as it enters a new era politically and militarily weakened. The Israeli military killed Nasrallah in a massive airstrike in September, a precursor to its ground invasion and a wider campaign to destroy Hezbollah’s infrastructure.The ceremony on Sunday included Lebanese politicians, Iranian diplomats and representatives from allied militias in the region.Iran’s parliament speaker, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi led their country’s delegation. Hezbollah’s Al Manar TV reported that family members of slain Iranian general Qasem Soleimani were in attendance. Lebanon’s parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, was also present.Hezbollah held an elaborate funeral for former leader Hasan Nasrallah on Feb. 23 in Beirut, nearly five months after he was killed in an Israel airstrike. (Video: Reuters)Crowds of people without tickets to the venue swelled in the surrounding streets. Inside, a giant banner of Nasrallah was erected on one end of the stadium, while supporters waved Hezbollah’s yellow flag from the bleachers, clutched photos of the longtime leader and chanted, “At your service, oh Nasrallah.”On the field, mourners surged and people in the stands wept when the coffins, holding Nasrallah and senior Hezbollah leader Hashem Safieddine, placed atop a truck guarded by fighters, finally emerged from behind a red curtain and entered the stadium.Nasrallah’s voice played over the speaker system as his coffin, draped in the Hezbollah flag and topped with his black turban, was rolled out.Minutes later, as the procession made its way around the stadium, the chants and wailing were momentarily silenced as four Israeli fighter jets — two F-15s, the planes used in the strike that killed Nasrallah, and two F-35s — thundered over the crowd at a low altitude.“Death to Israel!” the crowd shouted. “Death to America!” For several minutes afterward, eyes nervously glanced toward the sky.Later, the Israel Defense Forces released photos of its fighter jets over the funeral, as well as footage of the strike that killed Nasrallah on Sept. 27.The flights were “delivering a clear message,” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement. “You’ll specialize in funerals — we’ll focus on victories.”Hezbollah began firing at Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas. The two sides traded cross-border fire for nearly a year before Israel escalated its campaign in the fall, ramping up air and artillery strikes and sending ground troops into Lebanon’s south.In the wake of the September strike, Hezbollah had buried Nasrallah, who led the group for more than 30 years, in a temporary grave in an undisclosed location. After funeral prayers ended on Sunday, a procession led by Hezbollah fighters made its way through a sea of people who accompanied the coffin along the main highway to a mausoleum in Beirut’s southern suburbs.In a televised speech, Hezbollah’s new leader, Naim Qassem, hailed Nasrallah as “an Arab and Islamic national leader who represents the free people of the world.”Under his watch, Hezbollah, a militia and political party that grew out of Lebanon’s civil war, became one of the strongest non-state actors in the Middle East, boasting a fighting force of 100,000 and an estimated arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles. The group also dominated Lebanese politics and, along with its allies in parliament, had a final say over key government decisions.“Thirty-five years ago, Nasrallah said that even if the leader dies, we will grow stronger,” said Soulafa, 48, from Ain Aata in southern Lebanon. “Here we are. Despite everything that has happened, Israel could not stop this day from coming,” she said, speaking on the condition that she be identified only by her first name for security reasons.When asked how many family members were killed in the war, Soulafa said, “We lost everyone. But losing Nasrallah was bigger than all.”Hezbollah’s leaders hope to “demonstrate the party’s enduring popular appeal, to domestic and international actors alike, despite its recent setbacks,” said David Wood, a senior Lebanon analyst at the International Crisis Group.While the funeral might revive its image in the short term, Wood said, Hezbollah will need to grapple with long-term solutions for “the grave challenges facing its supporter base, starting with ensuring that postwar reconstruction can be completed as soon as possible.”Ceremonial funerals were also held in Iraq and Yemen, a reflection of Nasrallah’s popularity abroad. Delegations from those countries were present at the funeral, with Iraq sending its deputy parliament speaker, Muhsin al-Mandalawi, as well as representatives of Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and the Houthis in Yemen. Hamas released a statement mourning Nasrallah and Safieddine and thanked them for opening a front against Israel in southern Lebanon after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks.It is unclear whether Qassem will enjoy the same appeal inside Lebanon and abroad. “Nasrallah was a unique figure for Hezbollah, owing to his personal charisma and association with many of the group’s past successes. It will be very difficult for Naim Qassem to step fully into Nasrallah’s shoes,” Wood said.As the new Hezbollah chief began speaking on Sunday, hundreds had already left the stadium, most of them en route to Nasrallah’s grave. By the time he finished, many of the stands were almost empty.“The resistance is not over, the resistance continues on with its presence and its readiness,” Qassem said in his speech, in a rebuke to critics. “At our choosing, we will fire when we see fit and will be patient when we see fit, but the resistance is still here.”Hajar Harb in London, Suzan Haidamous in Corona, California, Mustafa Salim in Baghdad and Alon Rom in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.",
