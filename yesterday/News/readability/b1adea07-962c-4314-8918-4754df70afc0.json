New Jersey governor Phil Murphy announced a state of emergency “given flash flooding and high levels of rainfall in parts of the state.” He urged residents to stay indoors and avoid unnecessary travel.In New York, basement apartment residents were asked to prepare to evacuate at short notice. “If you live in a basement apartment, stay alert. Flash flooding can happen with little warning, including overnight,” New York City emergency management said on X. “Keep a phone, flashlight, and Go Bag nearby. Be ready to move to higher ground.”Airports, roads and railways hit Rainfall totals reached nearly 1.7 inches in parts of Staten Island and 1.5 inches in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighbourhood by 7:30 pm, and more rain was expected overnight. The NWS warned that rain could fall at rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, with some areas receiving up to 6 inches in total.Transport was severely affected. LaGuardia and Newark Liberty airports reported delays and disruptions, while John F. Kennedy Airport warned of potential issues. Substantial flooding shut down sections of major roads.New York City Transit reported flooding at subway stations in Queens. Train lines were severely disrupted, and the Staten Island Railway suspended service in both directions in the southern part of the borough due to high water levels.In New Jersey, video from social media showed residents wading through knee-deep water. County officials said water rescue equipment had been deployed. In Metuchen, widespread flooding forced road closures and police were seen helping stranded drivers.'One storm will follow another, after another'The heavy rainfall was caused by a slow-moving storm system combined with unusually humid and hot air, reports New York Times. Joseph Wegman from the weather prediction center explained that “one storm will follow another, after another,” overwhelming areas unable to absorb so much water in a short period.By Monday evening, flash flood watches stretched from North Carolina to New York. The NWS gave the Interstate 95 corridor from Washington, DC, to northern New Jersey a Level 3 out of 4 risk rating for flash flooding through Tuesday morning.On Tuesday, the system is expected to move south, increasing the flood risk for regions from northwestern North Carolina to southern New Jersey, including Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. “It's very possible some areas will have a worse day on Tuesday than Monday,” said Wegman.",
