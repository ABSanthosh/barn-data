  "text": "Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, holds a motherboard as he speaks during the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris, France, on June 11, 2025.Gonzalo Fuentes | ReutersNvidia CEO Jensen Huang unloaded roughly $36.4 million worth of stock in the leading artificial intelligence chipmaker, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.The sale, which totals 225,000 shares, comes as part of Huang's previously adopted plan in March to unload up to six million shares of Nvidia through the end of the year. He sold his first batch of stock from the agreement in June, equaling about $15 million.Last year, the tech executive sold about $700 million worth of shares as part of a prearranged plan. Nvidia stock climbed about 1% Friday.Huang's net worth has skyrocketed as investors bet on Nvidia's AI dominance and graphics processing units powering large language models.The 62-year-old's wealth has grown by more than a quarter, or about $29 billion, since the start of 2025 alone, based on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. His net worth last stood at $143 billion in the index, putting him neck-and-neck with Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett at $144 billion.Shortly after the market opened Friday, Fortune's analysis of net worth had Huang ahead of Buffett, with the Nvidia CEO at $143.7 billion and the Oracle of Omaha at $142.1 billion.Read more CNBC tech newsPerplexity launches AI-powered web browser for select group of subscribersRetailers log $7.9 billion in online sales in first 24 hours of Prime DayLinda Yaccarino steps down as CEO of Elon Musk's XElon Musk's Grok AI chatbot denies that it praised Hitler and made antisemitic commentsThe company has also achieved its own notable milestones this year, as it prospers off the AI boom.On Wednesday, the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker became the first company to top a $4 trillion market capitalization, beating out both Microsoft and Apple.
