  "text": "Meet Michael Hopkins, former Congressional staffer arrested for ammunition possession at the Capitol (Picture credit: X)Michael Hopkins, a 38-year-old former communications director for Representative Joe Morelle (D-NY), was arrested on Monday morning by US Capitol Police for attempting to bring ammunition into the Cannon House Office Building. During a routine bag screening at 8.45 am (local time), officers found 11 rounds of ammunition and four magazines, one of which was a high-capacity magazine. Hopkins reportedly stated that he had forgotten the ammunition was in his bag. He now faces charges for unlawful possession of ammunition, including one count related to the high-capacity magazine, reported Newsweek.The incident has sparked renewed scrutiny of Capitol security protocols. It is the second time in three years that a congressional staffer has been arrested for possessing ammunition at the Capitol. The arrest has already led to immediate repercussions, with Representative Morelle’s office terminating Hopkins’ employment by Monday afternoon and issuing a statement reaffirming its commitment to workplace safety, according to Axios.Who is Michael Hopkins?Michael Hopkins is a former communications director who worked for Congressman Joe Morelle, a Democrat representing New York’s 25th Congressional District. Hopkins was responsible for managing the office’s communications strategy, including public relations and media interactions. Morelle, a senior figure in the House, serves as the Ranking Member of the Committee on House Administration and holds significant influence in Capitol operations and workplace policies.Before this incident, Hopkins was a trusted aide within Morelle’s team, holding a crucial position in ensuring the congressman’s messages resonated with constituents and stakeholders. His role was particularly pivotal given Morelle’s responsibilities as a ranking member on a committee that oversees security, administration, and operations of the House of Representatives.Hopkins’ arrest has led to swift consequences. By Monday afternoon, Morelle’s office announced that Hopkins was no longer employed, stating that the decision was made “effective immediately.” The congressman’s office expressed its commitment to cooperating fully with the investigation and maintaining a safe and secure workplace, as highlighted by Newsweek.The arrest comes amid heightened scrutiny of security at the Capitol, especially following a similar incident in December 2023 when another staffer was arrested for possessing ammunition and a handgun. That episode exposed vulnerabilities in Capitol security protocols, which have since been tightened.",
