You can skip our detailed analysis of the global whiskey market, the Irish whiskey renaissance, and sustainability in the Irish whiskey industry, and go directly to the 5 Best-Selling Irish Whiskey Brands in the World. One of the oldest distilled spirits in the world, Irish whiskey is most often produced from a combination of malted and unmalted barley and is widely appreciated for its exceptionally smooth flavor and hints of vanilla. The use of unmalted grain began as a way to reduce the tax imposed on malted barley in the middle of the 19th century and is a key factor that distinguishes Irish whiskey from Scotch. Also, while most other whiskeys are twice distilled, Irish whiskeys are usually distilled three times in a column or pot still before they are matured in wooden casks for a minimum of three years. These intricate production steps combine to give the spirit its mellow and approachable character and turn it into a true gem of the Emerald Isle.

Whiskey is one of the Most Consumed Alcohols in the World, with the global whiskey market valued at $64 billion in 2022 and expected to reach $91.3 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 6% during the forecast period. The consumption of alcohol is shifting away from beer and wine and millennials are more likely to experiment with other alcoholic beverages, resulting in the growth of a ‘cocktail culture’. As a result of this tendency, the use of whiskey as a premium ingredient has increased. Product innovations such as flavored whiskeys and organic and sustainable options are also some of the major factors propelling the market. Ireland, once the grand capital of whiskey, is now once again making a grand comeback. The Emerald Isle has gone from once having just two operating distilleries – Bushmills and Midleton – to around 45 currently in operation, and several more in the pipeline. The value of Ireland’s whiskey exports crossed the €1 billion ($1.1 billion) mark for the first time in 2022, with global sales of Irish whiskey growing by 10.3% that year to around 15.25 million cases. The United States continues to be the top market for the category, representing 57% of the total export value. The Irish distillers have been especially focused on premiumization and the strategy seems to be paying off, as more and more consumers across the pond are turning to the smooth spirit as their luxury dram of choice. According to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, high-end premium and super-premium Irish whiskey categories have grown by an eye-watering 1,053% and 2,769%, respectively, in the last 20 years.",
