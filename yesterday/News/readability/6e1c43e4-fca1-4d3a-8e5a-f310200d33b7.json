  "text": "LONDON — President Donald Trump accepted a “really special” invitation from King Charles III to visit Britain for a state visit — the first U.S. president to receive such a diplomatic gesture twice.Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday personally delivered the invite, handing Trump a letter while visiting the White House.“This is really special. This has never happened before. This is unprecedented,” said Starmer.Trump immediately said yes.The British royal family is supposed to be apolitical. At the same time, it plays an important role in the country’s soft power, often being deployed as a charm offensive to try to secure favorable relations.The royal family may be one of the most effective cards the British government can play with Trump, a known royal enthusiast.Trump has previously spoken highly of the late Queen Elizabeth II — a “tremendous woman” — who hosted him for a state visit in 2019.A state visit is a grand, ceremonial affair full of pomp and pageantry and usually includes a carriage ride and a lavish state banquet.During Elizabeth II’s long reign, only three U.S. presidents were given full state visits: Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Donald Trump.Buckingham Palace confirmed that Trump will be the first elected political leader in modern times to be hosted by Britain for two state visits.The U.S. president appears to have a cordial relationship with Charles, despite the two men having differing views on issues including climate change. When Charles revealed his cancer diagnosis, Trump weighed in on social media saying that the king was a “wonderful man” whom he “got to know well” during his first term. According to Melania Trump’s memoir, the Trumps “exchange letters with King Charles to this day.”Trump proudly flashed the invite he received from the king in front of the cameras and said “at Windsor,” suggesting that could be the location of the state visit.The king suggested in his letter that he and Trump could meet, perhaps in Scotland at Balmoral or Dumfries House, to discuss the details of the visit. The setting could appeal to Trump — his mother was born in Scotland and one of his golf courses is only an hour’s drive from Balmoral.Trump isn’t a popular figure in Britain, and protest groups were quick to say that they planned to demonstrate during his visit.“This is the latest embarrassing step in Starmer’s attempts to toady to Trump and provide a cloak of respectability to Trumpism,” the Stop Trump Coalition group said in an email.When Trump visited the United Kingdom during his first term, he was met by significant protests, including the infamous 20-foot-tall blimp of Trump as a baby wearing a diaper.Foreign leaders invited for a state visit usually stay at Windsor Castle or Buckingham Palace, which is undergoing renovations.",
