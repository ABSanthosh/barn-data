  "text": "DHAKA: Former PM Khaleda Zia's BNP on Tuesday cautioned Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus that it will be \"difficult\" for the party to continue its cooperation with the interim govt if early election is not held by Dec 2025.The warning came days after Yunus in a meeting with political parties, including BNP, rejected their demand for early election by Dec and stuck to his Dec 2025-June 2026 timeframe to hold the poll - pending since last year following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-headed Awami League govt. \"We demand immediate announcement of a specific roadmap for forming the next parliament by Dec 2025 through a credible electoral process,\" said BNP's standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain at a press conference.He said ensuring free and fair election should remain the govt's top priority as it reflects the highest aspiration of the Bangladeshi people. \"Otherwise, it will be difficult for BNP to continue its cooperation with this govt,\" Mosharraf said.",
