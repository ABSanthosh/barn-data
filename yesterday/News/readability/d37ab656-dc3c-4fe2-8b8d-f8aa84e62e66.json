While discussions on gender identity and intersex rights are ongoing in various spheres, there is no confirmed evidence that US intelligence agencies have any official stance on such matters.Critics of the leak argue that it may have been taken out of context, while others see it as part of a broader ideological debate on gender and government influence. Neither the NSA nor the CIA has issued a statement on the alleged messages.Responding to the post, an X user sarcastically remarked, \"Seems like some friendly colleagues chatting about the vagaries of sex, gender, nature, and nurture. Not exactly a vast conspiracy. They come across as very human here.\"",
