  "text": "DUBAI — In the months since President Donald Trump was inaugurated, Saudi Arabia has found itself at the center of some of his most ambitious foreign policy and geopolitical goals, including hosting talks between U.S. and Russian officials, and facilitating negotiations both for a ceasefire and a lucrative minerals deal in Ukraine.Trump tapped the kingdom — whose de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is a close ally — to play the role of friendly but neutral mediator as he tries to reset U.S. relations with Russia and gain access to Ukraine’s mineral, oil and gas reserves. On Tuesday, the president announced that he will travel to Saudi Arabia next month on the first foreign trip of his second term — a visit he said would include finalizing an agreement to have Riyadh invest upward of $1 trillion in the U.S. economy.“I have a very good relationship with Mohammed and the king,” Trump told reporters from the Oval Office this week, referring to Mohammed’s 89-year-old father, King Salman, who has empowered his son as his successor. He described his previous visit to the kingdom as “an unbelievable day” and said he was going back now to create “tremendous amounts of jobs” in the United States.The move by Trump to have Saudi Arabia help mediate the high-stakes negotiations stems in part from Mohammed’s ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, but it also promises to revive the relationship the president and crown prince cultivated during Trump’s first term.Both Trump and Mohammed have touted a more transactional style of diplomacy, relying less on principles or alliances and instead using multibillion-dollar trade and investment deals to cement relations with other nations. Trump shielded Mohammed from scrutiny after the CIA concluded that he ordered the assassination of journalist and Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Later, a public fund led by Mohammed invested $2 billion in the equity firm of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.When Trump talks about reaching a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia — an effort that was underway in his first term but is now on hold because of the war in Gaza — he emphasizes what he says is the economic prosperity such an agreement would bring to the Middle East.“With Trump becoming president again, he’s really pulled Saudi Arabia right into the center of things,” said Neil Quilliam, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a British foreign affairs think tank. Quilliam said the kingdom has already benefited greatly from Trump’s second presidency, but that the crown prince’s ambition to project power globally was long in the making.Salman appointed Mohammed, who was serving as defense minister, crown prince in 2017, and he consolidated power almost immediately. Since then, he has said he wants to remake the Saudi economy and move it away from dependence on oil export revenue, while opening the country up to foreign investment and fast-tracking social change.Saudi Arabia has the world’s second-largest proven crude oil reserves, and Mohammed has used his position to promote “mega” projects, including plans for a “vertical” metropolis that runs on clean energy, while courting sports federations and hosting high-profile economic and political conferences.He maintained ties with Putin despite U.S. efforts to make the Russian leader a pariah, and ultimately helped facilitate high-profile prisoner exchanges between Washington and Moscow. After an initial period of confrontation, Mohammed also signed an accord with Saudi Arabia’s archrival, Iran.Inside Saudi Arabia, supporters of the monarchy see the Trump administration’s embrace of the kingdom as validation of the crown prince’s vision to modernize the country and assert its power more broadly.“This is the reward; we are reaping the rewards of the realignment of our foreign policy,” said Faisal Abbas, editor in chief of Arab News, a Saudi newspaper. He said as soon as Trump was reelected, many in Saudi Arabia believed “the stars were aligned” for the kingdom.“Now, Saudi Arabia can play its rightful role as the leading Muslim and Arab authority in the region,” Abbas said. Home to the birthplaces of Islam — Mecca and Medina — the kingdom has leveraged its guardianship of the holy sites to give it unique influence within the global Muslim community.Regional shifts have also occurred in the kingdom’s favor. Traditional centers of power in the Middle East, such as Egypt, Syria and Iraq, have been weakened by years of turmoil and economic decline. Those shifts opened up a leadership gap that Saudi Arabia was happy to fill, according to Dennis Ross, a former U.S. diplomat now with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a Washington-based think tank.Ross said Mohammed has both seized on regional shifts and adjusted after his own earlier missteps. “The longer he’s been in the position, he’s become more thoughtful, more systematic in terms of decision-making,” he said.“That’s something that we didn’t see necessarily when he first came in. He tended to be more impulsive,” Ross said.Saudi Arabia, however, remains deeply autocratic, and many of the dissidents swept up in its security crackdowns are still jailed. Last year, the government executed 345 people, the highest number of recorded executions in decades, according to a tally compiled by the human rights group Reprieve.Abdullah Alaoudh is the senior director for countering authoritarianism at the Middle East Democracy Center in Washington and a vocal critic of the monarchy. He said the Trump administration’s embrace of Saudi Arabia was an example of wealth and power winning out over human rights. “This is not a change of heart, this is [Mohammed] weathering the storm,” he said, referring to the crown prince’s continued use of harsh tactics domestically to maintain his grip on power.“When you have such power and money, people will deal with you,” he said, adding that even President Joe Biden, who vowed to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” after Khashoggi’s killing, eventually visited the country in 2022. Soon after that visit, Alaoudh said, Mohammed launched fresh crackdowns on dissidents, something he said he’ll be watching for after Trump visits in May.Hatem Alzahrani, a Saudi scholar and academic affiliated with the Middle East Institute, said Saudis supportive of the monarchy take outside criticism of the kingdom, especially from U.S. presidents, “with a grain of salt.”“We know that American politics is theater,” he said. Now, he said, he expects people will be even less likely to heed outside criticism. “Many Saudis have developed an immunity to being influenced by Western media,” he said. He added that the mood among the monarchy’s supporters is one of “a strong sense of national momentum.”But the region Saudi Arabia exists in today is much more volatile than it was a few years ago, and it’s unclear whether the conflicts swirling around the kingdom will derail Mohammed’s plans.As peace talks on Ukraine continue in Jeddah, conflicts closer to home are expanding. Heavy Israeli attacks on Gaza after the ceasefire deal collapse have killed hundreds. In Yemen, the United States has continued to bomb targets it said are linked to the Iranian-backed Houthis. And Trump has repeatedly threatened Iran with military force if its leadership doesn’t agree to a deal on its nuclear program.In their current forms, the region’s conflicts — in Gaza, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon — are “irritants” to Saudi Arabia’s ambitions, according to Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. “Despite all their recent wins, the situation remains dangerous,” he said, adding that Trump’s threats to attack Iran could prompt a backlash against the kingdom or further destabilize the region.“This all may reach a crescendo, and that would leave the Saudis in a very vulnerable position,” he said.",
