The ministry claimed to have thwarted the attack.Ukrainian soldiers fighting in the area who were reached by phone declined to discuss continuing operations beyond saying that Ukraine was on the offensive in parts of the Kursk region and that fierce fighting was raging there. The Ukrainian military high command said on Sunday night that there were 42 “combat engagements” in the region over the past 24 hours and that 12 were still happening.It was not possible to verify the claims by either side independently, and the scope of the Ukrainian assaults remained unclear.Ukrainian and Western military analysts said that the attacks could be a deliberate attempt at misdirection, trying to force Russian troops to shore up defenses there in the hopes of weakening them on the front line in Ukrainian territory.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
