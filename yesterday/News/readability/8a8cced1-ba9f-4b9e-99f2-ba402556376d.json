AGI broadly refers to AI that is smarter than humans.Hassabis said that the AI industry is \"on the path towards AGI,\" which he describes as \"a system that exhibits all the cognitive capabilities humans have.\"\"I think we're close now, you know, maybe we are only, you know, perhaps 5 years or something away from a system like that which would be pretty extraordinary,\" Hassabis said.\"And I think society needs to get ready for that and what implications that will have. And, you know, make sure that we derive the benefits from that and the whole society benefits from that, but also we mitigate some of the risks, too.\"Hassabis' comments mirror those of others in the industry who have suggested that AGI could be closer to reality.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman this year said that he is \"confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it.\"Still, many in the industry have also flagged multiple risks associated with AGI. One of the biggest concerns is that humans will lose control of the systems they created, a view shared by prominent AI scientists Max Tegmark and Yoshua Bengio, who recently shared their concerns with CNBC over this form of AI.",
