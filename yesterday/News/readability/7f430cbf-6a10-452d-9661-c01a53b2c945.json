The assault was over in a day when the Syrian soldiers retreated, said Abu Muhammad, a rebel fighter guarding the base.The government soldiers left behind a filthy jumble of army life: clothes, blankets, gas masks and helmets, and empty tin cans. Living conditions were primitive, with no windows or doors — instead, sacks or sheets of tin roofing were fixed over openings.The base reflected the opportunity for a new government borne out of a well-prepared military campaign, bringing together different rebel groups, whose success surprised even its own fighters. But it also was a measure of the challenges ahead as they look to rebuild a country broken by more than a decade of civil war, depriving and depleting its military.ImageSyrian fighters investigating an overturned tank, left behind after President Bashar al-Assad’s soldiers fought rebels advancing from the north, near a checkpoint on the outskirts of Homs.ImageLiving conditions at a military base near Aleppo were primitive, with openings covered by textiles or sheets of tin roofing.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
