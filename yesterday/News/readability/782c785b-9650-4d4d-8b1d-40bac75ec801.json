  "text": "KYIV — Russia and Ukraine agreed Tuesday to expand their initial limited ceasefire on energy infrastructure to include the Black Sea after U.S.-sponsored indirect talks in Saudi Arabia.In separate joint statements from the White House — one between the United States and Russia, another between the U.S. and Ukraine — the two countries agreed to “ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes” in the Black Sea, as well as to develop measures to implement and monitor the partial ceasefire. The statements did not specify when the limited ceasefire would go into effect.The statements — which came after this week’s technical talks in Riyadh, the Saudi capital — differed in two key ways. The U.S. separately agreed to help Russia gain access to world markets to export fertilizer and other agricultural products. For Ukraine, Washington reiterated its commitment to help facilitate the exchange of prisoners of war, civilian detainees and kidnapped children.In a news briefing Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was grateful to the U.S. side for the outcome and said it was his understanding “that once the American side officially issues a statement, the implementation of the decisions outlined in this document could begin.”A statement on the Russian presidency’s website said that the agreement includes lifting sanctions on Russia’s agricultural bank and some other institutions, and that the partial ceasefire would not go into effect until that happened. Russia has a long-standing demand to have access restored to the international SWIFT system for transferring money.The White House did not respond to questions about whether and which sanctions it was prepared to lift.Russia and Ukraine appeared to have different understandings of when the truce began and how any violations would be managed. The Kremlin wrote in a statement that the truce applied to five categories of energy infrastructure, including oil refineries, oil and gas pipelines, storage facilities, power plants and substations, and hydroelectric dams. It also said the moratorium was valid from March 18 and that if one side were to violate it, “the other party shall be entitled to consider itself free from the obligation to comply with it.”Zelensky, meanwhile, told journalists that the way violations would be managed was not included in the statements because “the American side was very eager not to let this fall apart.”He added that Ukraine’s follow-up conversation with American officials determined that if Kyiv identifies a violation of the deal, it “must reach out through all our available channels to the American side, presenting the facts and evidence that the Russian side has breached it.”An official familiar with negotiations, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss them freely, said Russia is using the results to now demand that President Donald Trump lift sanctions, “and in doing so, they’re even trying to steal from him the sense of success in his diplomacy.”“It’s a humiliation,” the official said.Russia’s backdating of the truce was “manipulating to shorten the term” of the deal, the official added. Ukraine’s position, the official said, “is that it should be effective from today; besides, a control mechanism still needs to be developed.”Serhiy Leshchenko, an adviser to the head of Zelensky’s office, said claims circulating among Russian lawmakers that Ukraine is to blame for the lack of a joint statement are “as false as the narratives that Ukraine killed civilians in Bucha or attacked the train station in Kramatorsk,” referring to Russian attacks in Ukraine in 2022.“Ukraine did not participate in any negotiations with Russia in Saudi Arabia and had no influence over the outcome documents. This is a classic case of blaming the victim. It is Russia that refuses to recover from its imperial pathology and continues to poison the lives of people across the world,” he said.Andriy Klymenko, head of the Black Sea Institute of Strategic Studies, said Russia’s and Ukraine’s positions remain “irreconcilable” and that the new agreements appear to amount only to “rhetorical acrobatics.”“These statements, the news items on the White House website, the commentary from Kyiv and Moscow — it all points to one thing: Nothing has been agreed. The war at sea will continue,” he said.“It turns out that after everyone made their comments, the United States believes it has reached a major new agreement. … In their view, the parties have agreed — meaning, the U.S. believes the parties agreed to ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea,” he added. “Meanwhile, the Russians believe they’ve secured a massive rollback of sanctions — which isn’t mentioned anywhere.”Zelensky, who said he wasn’t sure how the agreement would be implemented, said that while a ban on attacks against civilian infrastructure was not included in the statement, the issue was discussed with the Americans and therefore implied in the agreement.“The American side believes that calm skies, as related to the energy sector, also applies to other civilian infrastructure,” he said in the briefing.Later, in his daily evening address to the nation, Zelensky thanked Washington for its contributions and said Russia’s behavior this week “will reveal a lot — if not everything.”“If we see renewed air raid alerts, renewed military activity in the Black Sea, renewed Russian manipulation and threats, then new measures will have to be taken — specifically against Moscow,” he said. “What’s needed now is a result from Russia. We do not trust them. In truth, the world does not trust Russia. And they must prove that they are ready to end the war, ready to stop lying to the world, to Trump, to America.”The partial ceasefire would prevent Ukraine from striking Russian oil production and exports, which Kyiv had found to be effective at bringing the war home to the Kremlin. Ukrainian sea drones have also been effective in attacking the Russian Black Sea fleet.Most Ukrainians — as many as 85 percent — view a partial ceasefire positively, according to a poll from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, conducted from March 12 to 22, before the ban on attacks was updated to include the Black Sea.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Tuesday that the resumption of the Black Sea initiative was “agreeable” but that “we cannot take this man’s word for it,” referring to Zelensky.Lavrov said Moscow wants “the grain market, the fertilizer market to be predictable,” so that no one tries to remove Russia from those markets.The 2022 Black Sea Grain Initiative, also known as the “grain deal,” envisaged the export of Ukrainian grain from Black Sea ports and the normalization of Russian exports, such as agricultural products and fertilizers, to world markets after the war caused food prices to soar.When Russia abandoned the deal in 2023, John Kirby, then the spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council, said the U.S. and allies were working to ensure that both Russian and Ukrainian grain reached global markets, adding that “contrary to Russian propaganda, [sanctions] do not target Russian food or fertilizer.”Russian food exports have continued to rise during the war. In 2023, United Nations Secretary General António Guterres said the Russian grain trade was nearing full recovery, with high grain export volumes and stabilizing fertilizer markets, quoting the Russian Union of Grain Exporters and the Russian Fertilizer Producers Association.Dixon reported from Riga, Latvia.
