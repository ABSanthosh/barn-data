  "text": "The portrait of Donald Trump gifted to him by Vladimir PutinA portrait of Donald Trump, commissioned by the Kremlin and gifted to the US president by his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, shows the Republican Party's then presidential candidate striking his now iconic \"raised fist\" pose after the failed assassination attempt on him at a July 2024 rally, the artist behind the painting has revealed.The hitherto \"secret\" portrait also has the US flag and the Statue of Liberty, which are in the background.Nikas Safronov, who gave CNN an exclusive look at his painting, said he wanted to highlight Trump's \"bravery.\"Safronov, one of Russia's most famous artists, said, \"It was important to me to show the blood, the scar and his bravery during the attempt on his life. He didn’t break down or become afraid, but raised his arm to show he is one with America and will bring back what it deserves.\"Prior to the Trump portrait, the 69-year-old had painted multiple global figures, including the late Pope Francis, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, among others.For the one on the American leader, Safronov recalled how some \"visitors,\" unknown to him, asked to \"paint Trump as I see him.”He added that he did not charge money, as he realized \" this could bring our countries closer.\" His intuition would turn out to be correct.The artist stated, \"I was contacted by Putin himself, who told me the 'flattering' Trump portrait was an important step in improving Russia’s relationship with the United States.\"The portrait is similar to a painting which now hangs in the Grand Foyer of the White House, after an official portrait of former US President Barack Obama was removed from the location.",
