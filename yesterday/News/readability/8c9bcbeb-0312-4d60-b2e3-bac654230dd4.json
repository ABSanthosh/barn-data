The post does not specify the turtle’s date of death.The NC Zoo said the following in regards to Maximus’ death:It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Maximus, our beloved alligator snapping turtle, the gentle giant of the North Carolina Zoo. A resident of Cypress Swamp, Max was a favorite of both guests and staff, and a true marvel of nature at over 100 years old. Estimated to have been born around 1900, he witnessed over 100 years of human history, always with curiosity and grace.Maximus (North Carolina Zoo)Keeper Audrey shared her memories of Maximus, “I first met Maximus in the fall of 2015 when he moved to Cypress Swamp. He didn’t have a name, so I gave him one: Maximus, fitting for such a majestic creature. Over the years, we shared countless quiet moments, and I had the privilege of getting to ‘swim’ with him as I cleaned his pool. Despite his size, we danced together in our slow, routine movements, each of us occupying our own space, a ritual I will never forget.”Maximus was always a quiet observer, especially fond of interacting with the little ones who would get down to his level. His calm presence brought joy to so many visitors over the years, even when he was napping in the sun.Maximus may no longer be with us, but his spirit will live on in our memories and in the hearts of everyone who had the pleasure of meeting him. Rest in peace, Maximus. You will always be remembered.North Carolina Zoo, FacebookCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
