But with China, the relationship could get closer — or more combative.The production line at a Chinese electric vehicle maker, Nio, in Hefei, China, on Wednesday. The E.U. imposed higher tariffs on China-made electrical vehicles last year, but China’s commerce ministry said at a news conference on Thursday that the two sides had agreed to restart negotiations.Credit...Florence Lo/ReutersApril 4, 2025Updated 7:59 a.m. ETPresident Trump’s tariffs mean that companies across the European Union and around the world are at risk of losing access to the world’s largest consumer market.Naturally, they are looking for the next big thing. Statistically speaking, that would mean China.The E.U. has the second-largest consumer market in the world behind America; China is third. But China and the E.U. have not exactly been cozy in recent years. Europe has regularly blasted China for overproducing and dumping artificially cheap products on the global market, and European leaders have criticized China’s stance toward Russia’s war in Ukraine, among other political and social issues.Still, the E.U. is staring down 20 percent across-the-board tariffs in the United States, and even higher levies on major products like cars and trucks. China is confronting rates in excess of 50 percent. There’s a small chance that those tariffs could drive the two large economies closer together, experts said — an unintended consequence at a time when Mr. Trump’s America has been trying to weaken China.There have been early hints of a thaw. The E.U. imposed higher tariffs on Chinese-made electrical vehicles last year, but China’s commerce ministry said at a news conference on Thursday that the two sides had agreed to restart negotiations. Olof Gill, an E.U. spokesman for trade, said officials had agreed to “continue discussions” on electric vehicle supply chains and take a “fresh look” at pricing.But there is an even greater possibility that this moment will tear the E.U. and China further apart. China’s reduced access to American consumers could prod its companies to send even more cheap metals, chemicals and other products in Europe’s direction, worsening concerns about dumping and heightening already-high tensions on other matters. Relations between the two nations could deteriorate, widening the damage as America blows up longstanding global trade patterns.“There’s two ways that this could play,” said Theresa Fallon, an analyst at the Center for Russia, Europe, Asia Studies in Brussels. “Europe is in a really tough position.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
