It said 21 people were killed, 15 of whom suffocated.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said that 20 people were killed after armed agitators among a gathering crowd site created a “chaotic and dangerous surge.” Nineteen of the victims were trampled and one was stabbed, the aid organization said in a statement, adding that it was “heartbroken.”It was not immediately possible to explain the discrepancy in the death toll.ImageAt Nasser Hospital on Wednesday, a woman mourned Palestinians killed in the episode at the aid site.Credit...Hatem Khaled/ReutersThank you for your patience while we verify access.
