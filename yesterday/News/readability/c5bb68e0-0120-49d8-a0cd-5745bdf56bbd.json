Sounds good to me,\" Trump reacted on Truth Social triggering a volley of speculations about the secret offer, though The Sun hinted that it would be something to reduce tensions between the White House and Canada. The report said plans are afoot to make the US the next \"associate member\" of the Commonwealth -- a voluntary association of 56 nations, mostly British colonies. Canada is also part of the Commonwealth and as King Charles is one head of state of Canada, it will be his reconciliation plan, the report said. DailyMail quoted a member of the Royal Commonwealth Society who said that the possibility of America making an entry into the Commonwealth is being discussed at the highest levels and is being seen as a wonderful move that would symbolize Britain's close relationship with the US.\"Donald Trump loves Britain and has great respect for the Royal Family, so we believe he would see the benefits of this,\" the member said. The US has never been a part of the Commonwealth and the Royal Family thinks including it in the grouping would soothe the tension between Washington and Ottawa.
