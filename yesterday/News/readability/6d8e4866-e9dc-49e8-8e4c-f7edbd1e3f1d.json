President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, visiting the Turkish capital of Ankara, slammed the Kremlin for its “disrespect” in sending a midlevel delegation to Istanbul, where Russia wanted the talks to take place.“There is no time of the meeting, there is no agenda of the meeting, there is no high-level delegation,” Mr. Zelensky said at a news conference after sitting down with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. “I think Russia’s attitude is unserious.”After a day of uncertainty over whether Ukraine would participate in the talks in Istanbul, Mr. Zelensky said he would send a pared-down delegation there, led by the minister of defense, Rustem Umerov. He said he made the decision to show that Ukraine would engage in any effort for peace, even one with the slimmest chance of success, after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia rebuffed his appeal to meet in person in Turkey.Overshadowing it all was President Trump, who told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One that “nothing’s going to happen until Putin and I get together.” Mr. Trump, who was in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, had earlier said that he might travel to Turkey on Friday “if something happened” in the peace talks. However, there was no other indication that a last-minute summit would materialize.ImagePresident Trump with business leaders in Doha, Qatar, on Thursday.
