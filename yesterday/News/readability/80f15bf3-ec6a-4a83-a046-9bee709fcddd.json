  "text": "Here’s the latest.Israeli fighter jets and drones unleashed destruction and death across parts of Iran on Friday night and into Saturday morning in an attack on Tehran’s nuclear sites and military leadership. The strikes prompted a retaliatory barrage of missiles from Iran, some of which slammed into buildings in Tel Aviv, killing at least one person and injuring dozens.Missiles and drones flew in both directions as Israel said its military campaign, called “Rising Lion,” would continue for days, if not longer. Iran said Saturday morning that its response was not over, vowing revenge for what it described as an act of war by Israel.The most intense fighting between the two countries in decades generated anxiety around the world about the prospect of a widening regional war that could draw in the United States and other major military powers. Those concerns escalated as the some of the attacks found their targets, causing damage to buildings, injury and loss of life.Iranian ballistic missiles struck at least seven sites around Tel Aviv on Friday night, hours after waves of Israeli strikes devastated Tehran’s military chain of command and hit critical nuclear facilities. The attacks continued on Saturday morning, with Iran reporting dozens of people killed and Israel reporting about 20 people wounded, some seriously.On Saturday, residents in Tehran reported hearing explosions, and the Iran air defense fired nonstop rounds in the Pastour neighborhood. Precise casualty figures in Iran were difficult to confirm. But Iran’s U.N. ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, told the U.N. Security Council that Israel’s strikes in Iran had killed 78 people and injured 329 others.Earlier, explosions were heard over Jerusalem as missiles streaked overhead, while in Tel Aviv, Israeli television showed images of a severely damaged building and many mangled and burned cars from one of the sites hit. Three hospitals in the area said they had received about 20 wounded people, some with serious injuries. Fire officials said several people had been rescued from buildings struck by Iranian missiles. Thirty-four people were taken to hospitals in the area, officials said.An Israeli police spokeswoman confirmed that one woman was pronounced dead at the scene after an Iranian missile barrage struck Ramat Gan, a suburb east of Tel Aviv. Officials had previously said a 70-year-old woman was in critical condition after being pulled from the rubble of a building. It was not clear whether the two cases were the same.Rafael Grossi, the head of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, told the U.N. Security Council that Israel’s strike on Iran’s nuclear site near Natanz on Friday had destroyed its aboveground enrichment plant, causing chemical and radiological contamination. But he said the leak was “manageable.”An American official, who requested anonymity to discuss an ongoing operation, said the U.S. military was helping Israel intercept some of the ballistic missiles. The official said that U.S. military assets, already in the eastern Mediterranean to help defend American troops in the region, had been used to intercept the missiles.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps said in a statement that it had struck dozens of targets in Israel “forcefully and with precision,” including military and defense sites. The New York Times could not independently verify that claim.Israel Katz, Israel’s defense minister, said that Iran had “crossed a red line” by firing missiles at populated areas in Israel, warning that “the ayatollah regime would pay a very heavy price” for its actions.Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said earlier that Israel “should anticipate a harsh punishment” for its daylong assault, as some of Israel’s European allies expressed worry that Israel was ratcheting up its military conflict with Iran.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who has described the sustained assault as necessary to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, said in a video statement on Friday night that the people of Iran should rise up against their leaders.“The regime does not know what hit them, or what will hit them. It has never been weaker,” Mr. Netanyahu said.Here’s what else to know:Top Iranians killed: Two high-ranking military commanders, Mohammad Bagheri and Gen. Hossein Salami, were killed, Iran said, as was Ali Shamkhani, a politician who was overseeing the nuclear talks with the United States, officials said. Two senior Iranian government officials said Gen. Ismail Ghaani, the Quds Forces commander in charge of proxies in the region, was among those who had been killed.

He said the Iranian authorities had reported strikes on nuclear facilities in Fordo and Isfahan as well. Read more ›Trump’s reaction: President Trump is navigating the divides within the Republican Party over whether the United States should get involved in another foreign conflict. His administration had been holding nuclear talks with Iranian officials, and he has urged Tehran to strike a deal to curb its nuclear program or risk “even more brutal” attacks. Iran said it would not attend talks scheduled for this weekend in Oman.An Israeli police spokeswoman confirmed that one woman was pronounced dead at the scene after an Iranian missile barrage on Friday night struck Ramat Gan, a suburb east of Tel Aviv.Video from The Associated Press shows explosions rattling the sky above Tehran early Saturday.VideoCreditCredit...Associated Press IranTehranSmoke rising from a missile strike in the Iranian capital on Saturday.Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesRamat Gan, Israel Rescuers attempting to clear rubble from damaged houses after the missile strike.Associated PressTel AvivAn explosion from a projectile strike illuminated buildings on Saturday.Leo Correa/Associated Press Tel AvivIsrael’s Iron Dome air defense system intercepting missiles on Friday.Leo Correa/Associated PressTel AvivA fire burning inside an apartment building damaged by an Iranian airstrike.ReutersRamat Gan, Israel Rescue personnel at the site of an Iranian missile attack. Itai Ron/ReutersTel AvivIranian missiles struck at least seven sites in Tel Aviv and its surrounding areas.ReutersTehranResidents walking past a building destroyed by an Israeli strike on Friday.Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesTabriz, IranLarge plumes of smoke billowing from an airport after strikes hit the area.Obtained by ReutersTehranPeople marching to condemn the Israeli attacks on Friday.Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesNatanz, IranSmoke rising from a nuclear enrichment complex after explosions.Verified by The New York TimesTehranA building burning after Israel’s attack.Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesResidents of Tehran, the Iranian capital, say they are hearing drones buzz nonstop in the sky above them.

ImageOutside a damaged building in Tehran on Friday following attacks by Israel.Credit...Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesIranians have not experienced anything like this in almost 40 years.More than 200 Israeli warplanes dropped hundreds of bombs across Iran early Friday, rocking cities with explosions and jolting people out of their beds. They looked out windows onto columns of smoke, ran onto rooftops for a better view and made phone calls to their loved ones.In the aftermath of the attack, some also spoke to The New York Times, sending voice notes amid flickering internet service and offering a glimpse of people’s experiences in a country where many don’t feel comfortable speaking to international news outlets. They described confusion, fear and anger against Israel, whose widespread attacks drew comparisons to the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.‘We were not ready’Shakiba, a 37-year-old occupational therapist based in Tehran, was only comfortable using her first name because of the heightened security situation in the country. She had been getting ready for bed at home with her two cats when the bombing began.She looked outside and saw neighbors gathering on balconies and roofs, everyone trying to see what was happening. She added:“The first sound was really shocking, because we were not ready, we were not expecting it. And it wasn’t just one sound — we heard a couple of sounds at the first. And I know all the people around the country and around the city were following the news, but we were not expecting it to happen.”She later called two of her patients, an elderly couple who live alone, their children out of the country like many other Iranian families. They were near an area that came under attack, but their health conditions prevented them from leaving their home.“The woman just cried by the phone, and she said that ‘I was really afraid because we can’t move’,” Shakiba recalled. She tried to reassure them, stuck in their home.Listen to Shakiba’s Voice Note‘I just try to make her sure that it will not happen again, but I was not sure about this myself.’She also called another patient, a man with a neurological condition. He told her, “I’m OK now, but the sounds were so loud and so terrifying and I just felt that I am near to heart attack,” Shakiba said.Describing the bombardment, Shakiba said that people like her patients — children with special needs, the elderly, frail and ill — had few resources to help them. “They are in shock,” she said.Listen to Shakiba’s Voice Note“We are not aware of what we can do in these situations.”Nor did she feel confident about her own plans. “I have two cats and they’re both heavy,” she said. “It sounds silly with everything going on, but I keep thinking about how I can evacuate with them if the need comes.”‘Scenes of blood and flesh and burned feet’Jila Baniyaghoob, a journalist and women’s rights activist in Tehran, said that there had been a large focus on Israel’s military targets, but that civilians had been harmed in the attacks as well.She had a close friend at an apartment complex in the Saadat Abad district of Tehran, where residents include many faculty members from Tehran’s various universities, and which was struck during the attack early Friday.ImageA building in Saadat Abad was hit after Israel’s attack on Tehran.Credit...Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times A major fire spread after the attack, according to Ms. Baniyaghoob and photos of the scene. Ms. Baniyaghoob said that she had heard most of the people killed in the strike were not members of the military or involved in Iran’s nuclear program. The exact toll of the attacks remained unclear on Friday night, although Iran’s Fars news agency, citing unofficial figures, said that dozens had been killed and more than 300 others injured.Ms. Baniyaghoob said that her friend’s family had grabbed their young children and raced down stairwells to escape the complex. They passed “really awful scenes of blood and flesh and burned feet,” she said. “Most of the people who lived near the strike sites are feeling a collective fear, especially their children.”‘The people are paying the price’ Bahman Ahmadi Amouee, an economic journalist, said he, along with many others, had been feeling optimistic before the attacks, noting that Iran was engaged in diplomatic talks with the United States and that there were hopeful economic signs within Iran. But he believes the West and Israel took advantage of the circumstances, calling Israel’s leadership extremist and far right. “We’re seeing the same policy in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria — policies that contradict with what the West says it values, like democracy and human rights.”Mr. Ahmadi Amouee has written for newspapers that call for change within Iran and spent five years in Evin prison in 2009 amid a government crackdown on journalists.In conflict with Israel, “the people are paying the price,” he said. “Once the stores open on Sunday, the prices will have undoubtedly gone up. There’s long lines of gas everywhere, people are nervous.”He added:“Whenever there’s war, or earthquake, or famine, people start feeling unstable, and the most vulnerable people in these situations are usually women, children and impoverished people. As soon as the markets open after the two day holiday, we’ll see the price of dollar going up, and the instability and lack of security will only multiply.”The Israeli military just said in a statement that Iran had launched “dozens of missiles” at Israel over the past hour, overnight Saturday. While some from the lastest barrage were intercepted, others were not, the military said. Search-and-rescue teams were operating where projectiles had reportedly fallen, it added.The radiation risk from Israel’s strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites is low, for now.ImageIran’s Arak heavy water production facility in 2004.Credit...Majid Saeedi/Getty ImagesStrikes on any nuclear facilities could, in theory, release clouds of deadly radiation that endanger human lives and health. But in the case of Israel’s attacks on Iran overnight on Friday, that appears so far to not have been the case.The earliest attacks and targets seem for the moment to rule out the most dangerous outcomes, limiting possible radiation threats to the realm of the relatively minor.The most dangerous kind of threat would arise from successful attacks on nuclear reactors. Over time, the splitting of atoms in reactor fuel results in buildups of highly radioactive spinoffs. Among the worst are Cesium 137, Strontium 90 and Iodine 131.If Iodine 131 is inhaled or ingested, it ends up in a person’s thyroid gland. There, its intense radioactivity raises dramatically the risk of thyroid cancer, particularly in children. The other isotopes can also result in cancers.But so far, no reports or evidence suggest that Iran’s nuclear reactors were hit in the Israeli attacks. Apparently spared were a power plant on the Persian Gulf, a research reactor in Tehran and a heavily guarded site ringed by antiaircraft weapons and miles of barbed wire.Known as Arak, that isolated complex was long suspected of being built to produce plutonium, one of the two main fuels for atom bombs. But the Obama administration’s 2015 deal with Iran turned the complex into a nuclear relic unusable for that purpose. The Arak reactor never came to life.A lesser threat to human health revolves around uranium, the other fuel of atom bombs. In recent years, Iran has focused on it with great intensity, building an increasingly wide array of industrial plants and complexes to refine the fissile element.Uranium ore that miners dig up is relatively harmless. But it contains tiny amounts of a rare radioactive isotope, Uranium 235, that can be used to power nuclear reactors at low levels of enrichment, and to fuel atom bombs at higher levels. The percentage of U-235 in mined uranium is less than 1 percent.The goal of uranium enrichment is to raise the percentage, which is often done through the use of centrifuges — machines that spin at extremely high speeds. Iran started with low percentages and, over decades, has increasingly raised its enrichment levels. The highest now stand at 60 percent, which is just short of bomb grade.For human health, the higher the level of U-235 enrichment, the greater the danger. The isotope and its decay products emit three types of radiation: alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays. The first two are relatively weak. Alphas cannot penetrate skin. Betas can be stopped by a layer of clothing.But gamma rays are highly energetic and can penetrate the human body, damaging DNA and sowing the seeds of cancer. It takes thick concrete or lead to stop the penetrating rays.Satellite images and expert analyses show that a main target of the Israeli strikes was the Natanz complex, the largest of Iran’s enrichment sites. Fully destroyed was the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant, where Iran was producing uranium enriched to near 60 percent. The images show a dark craterlike scar. And videos from a distance show clouds of dark smoke.It’s possible that some of that smoke contained U-235 particles, which may pose a regional health hazard. But the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors the Iranian site, said it had so far detected no such danger.“The level of radioactivity outside the Natanz site has remained unchanged and at normal levels indicating no external radiological impact to the population or the environment from this event,” Rafael Mariano Grossi, the agency’s director general, said Friday before the U.N. Security Council.He mentioned concerns about alpha particles inside the Natanz facility, but called them “manageable” with appropriate radiation protection measures.Acknowledging reports of attacks at Fordo and Isfahan, two other nuclear fuel sites in Iran, he said “we do not have enough information.”Aside from the radiation danger, a complicating factor in the health calculus is that uranium in all its forms is a toxic heavy metal, similar to lead. If ingested it can produce a cascade of adverse health effects, with the kidneys a main target. Acute exposure can lead to renal failure. The main routes of exposure are ingestion of contaminated food and water, inhalation of airborne dust, and, to a lesser extent, contact with the skin.The inhalation of uranium dust — a common hazard in mining and milling — is also a hazard. Inhaled particles can lodge in the lungs, leading to respiratory irritation, inflammation, and, over time, such lung diseases such as fibrosis.A number of diplomats expressed their worries before the Council about the radiation threats from Israel’s strikes.“We are particularly concerned by the potential radiological consequences,” said Vasily Nebenzya, Russia’s permanent representative to the U.N. They can lead, he added, “to the most dire consequences not just for the Middle East region, but for the world as a whole.”Mr. Nebenzya said Russia was following closely the status of the inspectors in Iran of the I.A.E.A.“The life and health of its personnel has been threatened,” he said. “And we expect that the director general of the agency is going to provide us with objective assessment and analysis of the developing situation, including from the viewpoint of radiological consequences.”Dozens of Israelis were huddled in an underground bomb shelter in West Jerusalem.

The videos indicate that at least one of Iran’s missiles reached a sensitive command site inside Israel.Prominent in footage of the strike was the Marganit Tower in the Kirya area of Tel Aviv, a landmark in the center of the city that is close to I.D.F. headquarters.The clips initially show outgoing projectiles, likely missile defense interceptors. Then a streak of light, a loud boom and a bright flash from the explosion of the incoming missile.Sirens blared across Jerusalem, signaling incoming rocket fire.

Cross for The New York TimesAs Israel pummels Iran with waves of airstrikes, President Trump is navigating the divides within the Republican Party over whether the United States should get involved in another foreign conflict.On one side are the isolationists who fear that Israel could pull the United States into another Middle East war. And on the other are the Iran hawks and Israel supporters who have been calling for just this sort of military action for years.Mr. Trump appears caught between the two sides, veering back and forth as he tries to distance the United States from Israel’s assault while celebrating the success of the attacks and warning Iran that more is coming.“This, right now, is going to cause, I think, a major schism in the MAGA online community,” Charlie Kirk, the right-wing activist and podcaster, said Thursday on his podcast.Mr. Trump had several times this year dissuaded Israel from launching an attack, saying he wanted to pursue a negotiated settlement with Iran. Shortly after the assault began, the White House sent out a statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, emphasizing that the United States was not involved in the initial military operation.“Israel took unilateral action against Iran,” Mr. Rubio said. “We are not involved in strikes against Iran, and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region.”But in subsequent interviews, the president said he spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Thursday, knew the attacks were planned and called the strikes “excellent.” In a post on Truth Social, he wrote Israel has “already planned attacks” that would be “even more brutal.” And the U.S. military helped Israel intercept some of the ballistic missiles Iran fired in retaliation, an American official said.While running for president, Mr. Trump promised to end wars around the world, and in his inaugural address, he said he wanted to be remembered as a peacemaking president. So far, Mr. Trump’s diplomatic efforts have failed to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, which he had promised to do within 24 hours, or the war between Israel and Hamas.Over the past several months, the Trump administration had been trying to strike a new nuclear deal with Iran, and the president had urged Mr. Netanyahu to hold off any military actions as the talks continued.“I don’t want them going in because that would blow it,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House just hours before the attacks.After Israel launched the missiles, Mr. Trump put the blame on Iran, faulting its leaders for refusing to accept a proposal that would have stopped it from enriching uranium.“I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal,” he wrote on Truth Social on Friday morning. “I told them, in the strongest of words, to ‘just do it,’ but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn’t get it done.”Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted that Mr. Trump had flipped his position on whether Israel should strike Iran. But he said Israel made a calculated gamble that Mr. Trump would go along with the idea.“They made a bet on President Trump,” he said, adding: “Trump, for a long time — most of the time he’s been in office — has been saying ‘no, we’re negotiating, no, don’t do it.’ The Israelis strike, and today Trump called it excellent.”For many Republicans, Israel’s military strikes were long overdue amid growing fears that Iran was moving closer to full nuclear capabilities.“The number of Republicans who do not see a nuclear-armed Iran as a threat to Israel and the world is exceedingly small,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina and a close ally of the president. “The overwhelming majority of Republicans back Israel’s use of military force to neuter the Iranian nuclear threat.”Another faction of Mr. Trump’s most ardent supporters see it differently. Israel’s strikes and the prospect of U.S. involvement in the conflict, they argue, run counter to Mr. Trump’s “America First” foreign policy agenda.“The emails are so largely overwhelmingly against Israel doing this, I’d say it’s probably a 99 to one,” Mr. Kirk said on Thursday night of feedback he was receiving from his listeners.Some MAGA supporters argued that Israel’s targeted strikes of both nuclear sites and top military commanders were part of an effort to ignite a bigger conflict and draw the United States into it. U.S. officials said on Friday that the Pentagon was positioning warships and other military assets in the Middle East to help protect Israel and U.S. troops in the region from any further Iranian retaliation.“The bottom line is we cannot be dragged into, inexorably dragged into, a war on the Eurasian land mass in the Middle East or in Eastern Europe,” Stephen K. Bannon, a former top adviser to Mr. Trump who remains close to the president, said on Friday on his “War Room” podcast.On Israel, he said: “Hey, you guys did it. You’re putting your country first. Your country’s defense first. That’s fine, but we’ve got to put our defense first.”But Michael Rubin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said the Trump administration was just “shouting from the sidelines.”“Trump will likely keep the U.S. out of conflict and offer mediation, but at this point, he’s just basically treading water,” he wrote in an email. “The big issue will play out in Congress during debates about Israel aid and replenishing Israeli stockpiles.”Eric Schmitt and Helene Cooper contributed reporting.The Israeli military said it had intercepted two hostile aircraft in the Arava area in southern Israel. The military did not say if the aircraft were military drones.The Palestinian Authority in the Israeli-occupied West Bank said that its civil defense office had received 40 reports of injuries and property damage from shrapnel falling there. The injured included seven children who sustained minor to moderate injuries and were transferred to medical centers for treatment, civil defense officials said in a statement.Iranian air-defense batteries are firing continuously in Tehran’s Pastour neighborhood, where the country’s supreme leader lives and the president’s compounds are located, residents said. The Israeli military said a hostile aircraft had triggered air-raid sirens in the southern port city of Eilat, on the Red Sea. The military did not say if the aircraft was a drone or an airplane.Residents in Tehran report hearing sounds of explosions and air-defense missiles firing in the early hours of Saturday. Mahsa, a 47-year-old engineer in northern Tehran, says the explosions are relentless and her family has been unable to sleep. Some of her neighbors are remaining in the garden and on the streets, fearing being caught in attacks on residential buildings.Iranian air defenses in Tehran are trying to repel new Israeli strikes on Iran’s capital, according to the Iranian state news agency IRNA.Israel destroyed part of Iran’s premier weapons facility, the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said.ImageMembers of the U.N. Security Council listening to a briefing by Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency.Credit...Michael M. Santiago/Getty ImagesIsrael’s strikes against Iran’s premier nuclear enrichment site at Natanz destroyed the facility’s aboveground enrichment plant, Rafael Grossi, the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, told the Security Council on Friday.Natanz was among the first targets hit by Israel in its initial attack early Friday morning. But in later strikes, Mr. Grossi said, Israel appeared to have also hit two other facilities, in Isfahan and Fordo, at which Iran has been working to produce weapons-grade uranium.The damage to Natanz, a facility roughly 140 miles south of Tehran, appeared to be severe. The site, which hosts a range of advanced centrifuges, is mainly underground.As a result of Friday’s attack, Mr. Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said there had been “radiological and chemical contamination” within the facility. But he said the leak was “manageable” with appropriate protection measures. Electricity infrastructure, main power supplies and generators at the facility have been destroyed, he added.Natanz had been targeted in the past, with a computer virus, Stuxnet, some 15 years ago, and with sabotage and explosions as recently as 2021. After previous attacks, Iran has always repaired the damage and increased the sophistication of its centrifuges.Mr. Grossi also said that Iran had informed the nuclear agency that its facilities at Isfahan and Fordo had also come under attack. The extent of the damage, he said, was unknown.“We do not have enough information beyond indicating that military activity has been taking place around these facilities as well,” he told members of the Security Council.Israel has indicated it would attack the site at Fordo, Iran’s second-largest but most heavily fortified nuclear enrichment installation, which is buried beneath a mountain.Experts said that without disabling Fordo, where Iran possesses enough centrifuges to quickly produce weapons-grade uranium, Israel’s operation would fail to destroy Iran’s nuclear program.On Thursday, the I.A.E.A. said Iran had not complied with its nuclear nonproliferation obligations and passed a vote of censure against the country for the first time in 20 years.Steven Erlanger contributed reporting.In a diplomatic scramble, world leaders urge restraint between Israel and Iran.ImagePrime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain had separate calls Friday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Trump.Credit...Henry Nicholls/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe Israeli attack on Iran and Tehran’s retaliatory strikes inside Israel have prompted a flurry of diplomatic conversations among world leaders, many of whom urged restraint from both countries.A White House official said that President Trump talked with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Friday afternoon after the attacks were underway, the second time in two days that the two leaders had spoken. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing conflict, said the two men discussed the ongoing situation in Iran and Israel.Mr. Netanyahu also discussed Israel’s decision to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities and top military officials with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, India and Russia, according to officials in Israel and several of the other countries.In Britain, a Downing Street spokesman said that Prime Minister Keir Starmer told Mr. Netanyahu that Israel had a right to self-defense, but he “reiterated the need for de-escalation and a diplomatic resolution, in the interests of stability in the region.”Mr. Starmer also spoke with Mr. Trump, according to the prime minister’s office, which said that Mr. Starmer “reiterated the U.K.’s grave concerns about Iran’s nuclear programs” and told the president that they “agreed on the importance of diplomacy and dialogue.”The calls between world leaders underscored the anxiety in global capitals about another Middle East war that could further destabilize the region, hike oil prices and increase the possibility of global terror attacks.Mr. Netanyahu’s office focused on expressions of support for Israel, saying in a statement that “the leaders showed understanding of Israel’s need to defend itself from Iran’s threat of annihilation.”But President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia condemned the Israeli strikes after speaking with Mr. Netanayhu and President Masoud Pezeshkian of Iran.“Russia condemns Israel’s actions, which contravene the United Nations’ statute and the international law,” the Kremlin said in a statement on Friday.Mr. Putin offered to mediate the conflict, claiming that Russia offered “concrete initiatives” to Iran and Israel to achieve peace.Axios reported that Mr. Trump had also talked with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia to discuss the need to stop the escalation between Iran and Israel.Abbas Araqchi, the Iranian foreign minister, rejected calls for restraint from Iran in a call with David Lammy, the British foreign secretary, Reuters reported.Aric Toler and Riley MellenReporting from New YorkVideos posted on social media on Friday and verified by The New York Times record a loud boom and a bright flash from an incoming missile in central Tel Aviv, quickly followed by the apparent launch of a projectile that from a missile defense system. The explosion took place in the Kirya section of Tel Aviv, where a number of military facilities are located, including the Israeli Defense Forces headquarters.Israel’s strikes have killed 78 people, including senior military officials, and injured 329 others, Iran’s U.N. ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, told the United Nations Security Council on Friday.President Trump spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel today on the phone to discuss the conflict with Iran, according to a White House official, who declined to provide details on the conversation.Fewer than 100 missiles were fired during the two Iranian missile barrages against Israel, according to the Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin. Buildings were hit, he said, with some of the damage caused by debris from interceptions by Israel’s air-defense system.Israeli TV showed images of damaged multistory buildings in central Tel Aviv and the eastern suburb of Ramat Gan. Most of the missiles failed to reach their targets or were intercepted, Defrin said.At least 40 people have been wounded in Tel Aviv and the surrounding area, according to a tally from three hospitals. Most patients are moderately injured, but a few are in critical condition.How Israel defends against Iran’s missiles.ImageIsrael’s Iron Dome defense system over Ashkelon, Israel, in October, following a launch of missiles from Iran.Credit...Amir Cohen/ReutersIran launched retaliatory strikes against Israel on Friday, less than a day after Israel’s military carried out a mass attack targeting Tehran’s nuclear program and top commanders.With billions of dollars worth of sophisticated and multilayered aerial defenses, Israel has long been prepared for a full-scale assault by Iranian missiles and drones.Those layers of protection are now being put to the test, with Israeli authorities confirming that missiles hit multiple sites. In previous exchanges between the two countries, Iran mostly targeted Israeli military bases. But the scope of Israel’s assault, which devastated Iran’s military chain of command, could prompt a much wider Iranian counterstrike.“One of the most effective tactics to inflict maximum damage on the Israeli home front would be to overwhelm its air defense systems,” said Joe Truzman, a senior analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Long War Journal.He said Israel will have “only a brief window to detect, assess, and respond to this looming threat.”Here’s what to know about Israel’s defenses against Iranian attack.What are Israel’s air defense systems?Israel’s anti-missile systems include:Iron Dome: Israel’s best-known air defense system fires interceptors to take down short-range rockets.David’s Sling: This stationary weapon can shoot down short- and medium-range ballistic and cruise missiles. It has a range of about 185 miles. Like the Iron Dome, it is a “hit-to-kill” weapon that takes down targets by flying into them.Arrow 2 and 3: These ground-based mobile launchers fire fragmentation warheads packed with explosives that blow up near incoming missiles. The Arrow 2 can intercept targets high in the atmosphere, at an altitude of about 30 miles and a range of about 60 miles. The Arrow 3 can go beyond the atmosphere into space, with a range of up to 1,500 miles. It is one of Israel’s most advanced defenses.Iron Beam: This high-powered laser was developed to intercept rockets, drones and anti-tank missiles. It was first deployed in the field after Hamas’s 2023 attack on southern Israel, which prompted wars in Gaza and Lebanon.What are the biggest threats to Israel’s defenses?One of the most serious threats posed by Iran comes from its heavyweight ballistic missiles, which fly at the edge of space at many times the speed of sound. They can cross the roughly 1,000 miles between Iran and Israel in just a few minutes.Antimissile systems like Arrow 3, which have a limited supply of expensive interceptors, do not always hit their ballistic missile targets.Last October, analysts at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, in California, concluded that Israel had run low on interceptors, after about 30 Iranian ballistic missiles landed near a military base in southern Israel unscathed. Last month, a Houthi missile launched from Yemen evaded Israeli and American air defense systems to strike near Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv.It can take years to produce enough missile interceptors to keep them reliably stockpiled, and Israel “has been expending them,” said Tom Karako, a missile defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.Another problem for Israel will be tracking and destroying unmanned drones, which fly low and slow, making them much harder to detect. In the past, Israel has scrambled fighter jets to shoot down drones beyond Israel’s borders; failing that, Israeli forces have used the Iron Dome system, which is most effective against short-range rockets.What about Israel’s allies?The United States is also helping to defend Israel’s skies.Days after Iran fired a barrage of about 180 ballistic missiles at Israel in October, the United States sent a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, to bolster Israeli defenses. The THAAD is a mobile surface-to-air interceptor designed to shoot down incoming ballistic missiles, which its radar can detect from more than 1,800 miles away. THAAD can strike incoming targets both within the Earth’s atmosphere and above it.The Trump administration sent Israel a second THAAD battery earlier this spring, said Yehoshua Kalisky, a military technology expert at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy has deployed the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson to the Arabian Sea; there are more than 60 aircraft aboard the Vinson, including advanced F-35 stealth strike fighters. The American military also has several dozen attack and fighter jets deployed in the Middle East, which were used extensively to defend Israel from Iranian strikes last year.Neighboring Jordan has said it is continuing to intercept hostile missiles and aircraft entering its airspace, protecting not only its own territory but also serving as a de facto layer of security for Israel.What’s in Iran’s arsenal?Iran keeps its military stockpiles and capabilities secret, so experts said it is impossible to know how extended or powerful its airstrikes could be. Mr. Truzman said Iran could also amass support from its regional proxy militias, in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen. On Friday, sirens were triggered in Israel after an incoming ballistic missile was detected from Yemen, but it reportedly landed in an uninhabited area in the West Bank.Mr. Karako and Mr. Kalisky said Israel likely destroyed many of Iran’s weapons systems with its strikes on Friday.“It will take the Iranians sometimes to organize the missile force again,” Mr. Kalisky said. “We have several layers of defense, so I don’t worry.”Israeli hospitals are treating dozens of people critically injured in the Iranian missile attack, including one woman at Beilinson Hospital who is “fighting for her life,” the hospital said in a statement.Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that Israel’s strike on the Iranian nuclear facility near Natanz had destroyed the above-ground enrichment plant, causing chemical and radiological contamination. The underground halls at Natanz were not hit, Grossi said, though damage to the power supply to the halls may have damaged the centrifuges housed there. He said the Iranian authorities had reported strikes on nuclear facilities in Fordo and Isfahan as well.ImageCredit...Eduardo Munoz/ReutersIsraeli firefighting forces said in a statement that they were rescuing people from buildings struck by the Iranian attack on Tel Aviv and its surrounding areas. So far, they said, 22 injured people have been rescued.The U.S. military is helping Israel to intercept some of the ballistic missiles which Iran fired in retaliation of Israeli strikes, an American official said. The U.S. has already begun moving more military assets to the eastern Mediterranean to help defend American troops in the region. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive operations, said that American military assets already in the region were used to intercept Iranian missiles on Friday.How is Israel protecting its critical sites from Iranian retaliation?ImageA partial view of the Dimona nuclear reactor in Israel’s southern Negev desert, in 2014.Credit...Jack Guez/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIran fired its first barrage of dozens of missiles at Israel on Friday night, about 18 hours after Israel’s attacks on Iran began. Israel’s emergency services said they were searching seven sites where missiles or debris hit in the greater Tel Aviv area, the military said. As Israel braces for further retaliation for its attack on Iran’s nuclear program, here are some of the most critical sites, which are likely to be heavily protected:Israel’s nuclear reactor in Dimona, in the southern Negev desert. Israel has long maintained ambiguity about its nuclear capabilities but is widely believed to have nuclear weapons. A recently declassified U.S. intelligence report from December 1960, by the Joint Atomic Energy Intelligence Committee, stated that the Dimona project included a reprocessing plant for plutonium production. The report concluded then that the project was related to nuclear weapons. Israel has not signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.The country’s main ports, Haifa and Ashdod, on the Mediterranean coast. Israel also has offshore natural gas platforms, part of its energy infrastructure. In a statement on Friday, Israel’s Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure said it could order the temporary closure of some of the offshore gas fields, citing security concerns given the escalating tensions in the region.Ben Gurion, Israel’s international airport. The airport was shut down on Friday morning, and all incoming and departing flights were canceled as Israel closed its airspace to civilian traffic. Last month, a ballistic missile launched from Yemen by the Iranian-backed Houthi militia struck near Ben Gurion’s main terminal, close to Tel Aviv, after the military failed to intercept the projectile.Military bases. The Israeli military is also likely to take measures to protect its headquarters and air bases around the country. U.S. lawmakers are divided over the Iranian strikes.ImageThe US Capitol on Friday morning. Many members of Congress were quick to cheer Israel’s actions and framed them as a justified response to Tehran’s refusal to abandon its nuclear ambitions.Credit...Eric Lee for The New York TimesIsrael’s overnight missile strike against Iran divided Congress, drawing praise and strong support from members of both parties, but some lawmakers, most of them Democrats, expressed concern about regional instability and the risk the United States might be drawn directly into the conflict.Many members of Congress were quick to cheer Israel’s actions and framed them as a justified response to Tehran’s refusal to abandon its ambition to obtain nuclear weapons. Others, including several leading Democrats, urged restraint, warning about the potential for escalation.The divergent reactions reflected a political divide over President Trump’s leadership, the use of military force, the role of diplomacy and America’s obligations in the Middle East.Some Republicans in Congress applauded the operation even before President Trump praised it.“Game on,” declared Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and one of the most vocal Iran hawks on Capitol Hill, moments after the news broke. In a later statement, Mr. Graham said: “Hats off to Israel for one of the most impressive military strikes and covert operations in Israeli history.”The House speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, also offered unequivocal support for the strikes, saying in a social media post late Thursday that “Israel IS right — and has a right — to defend itself!”After Mr. Trump weighed in Friday morning, saying that Iran had brought the attacks on itself, Mr. Johnson applauded the administration’s decision to back Israel’s security goals and echoed the president’s position that Iran “must never obtain a nuclear weapon.”Mr. Johnson, who recently announced a trip to Israel later this month to address a special session of the Knesset, displayed the same frustration that many on Capitol Hill have expressed in recent weeks over Tehran’s refusal to shelve its nuclear ambitions.“President Trump and his administration have worked tirelessly to ensure that outcome. Unfortunately, Iran has refused to agree and even declared yesterday its intent to build a new enrichment facility,” he said in a statement on Friday.Senator James E. Risch, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, had a similar message, saying, “We stand with Israel tonight and pray for the safety of its people and the success of this unilateral, defensive action.”Hours after the attack, the Senate majority leader, John Thune of South Dakota, said that he strongly supported the strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, and in a statement said that the regime and its proxies had positioned themselves as an anti-democratic threat to the region.“For too long, the mullahs in Iran have publicly aspired to wipe the only democracy in the Middle East off the face of the map via any means possible: funding and arming terror groups on Israel’s borders, choking off international sea lanes, and multiple barrages of missiles and drones,” he said in the statement.The top two Democrats in Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York, said in separate statements that they were closely monitoring the situation as it continued to unfold.“The United States’ commitment to Israel’s security and defense must be ironclad as they prepare for Iran’s response,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement on Friday afternoon. He and Mr. Jeffries both emphasized the “ironclad” U.S.-Israel relationship and denounced Iran’s defiance of its nuclear obligations, reiterating the dangers of a nuclear Iran to both the United States and the entire Middle East.“There is no circumstance where Iran can be permitted to become a nuclear power,” Mr. Jeffries said in a statement, adding an urgent call for international leaders to “find a rigorous diplomatic path forward and avoid any situation where U.S. troops are put in harm’s way.”Among Democrats, no lawmaker has been more vocally supportive of Israel than Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who has carved out a distinct role as the party’s most unapologetic defender of the U.S.-Israel alliance.In the hours after the strike, Mr. Fetterman posted on social media: “Our commitment to Israel must be absolute and I fully support this attack. Keep wiping out Iranian leadership and the nuclear personnel. We must provide whatever is necessary — military, intelligence, weaponry — to fully back Israel in striking Iran.”And several strongly pro-Israel Democrats in the House praised the strikes. Representative Greg Landsman of Ohio swiftly issued a statement proclaiming: “Israel is justifiably defending itself and its people.”But other Democrats called for de-escalation or expressed concern that Israel’s military action could lead to broader regional instability.“Israel’s strikes against Iran represent an escalation that is deeply concerning and will inevitably invite counterattacks,” said Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. “This risks not only U.S. negotiations with Iran, but the safety of American service members, diplomats, their families and expats around the region.”Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat of the Armed Services Committee, echoed those concerns.“I urge both nations to show immediate restraint, and I call on President Trump and our international partners to press for diplomatic de-escalation before this crisis spirals further out of control,” he said. “The world cannot afford more devastating conflict born of shortsighted violence.”Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said in a statement a war between Israel and Iran “may be good for Netanyahu’s domestic politics, but it will likely be disastrous for both the security of Israel, the United States, and the rest of the region.” He added that the United States has “ no obligation to follow Israel into a war we did not ask for and will make us less safe.”At least one right-wing Republican voiced the same the sentiment. “I’m sad to say but some members of Congress and US Senators seem giddy about the prospects of a bigger war,” Representative Warren Davidson, Republican of Ohio, wrote on social media.Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement on Friday that President Trump and Republican officials were ultimately to blame for the spiraling conflict between Israel and Iran because Mr. Trump had withdrawn from a nuclear agreement with Iran in 2018. Still, he said the diplomacy Mr. Trump has been doing in recent weeks with Iran was the best path forward now, if it can continue. “The consequences of further escalation of violence in the Middle East could be profound — for regional security, for global energy markets, and most urgently, for innocent civilians,” he said. “The United States must continue to engage diplomatically to prevent a broader war and to pursue long-term security solutions that deter aggression and promote stability.”Ed Wong contributed reportingIsrael’s next target is Fordo, a nuclear site hidden in a mountain.ImageA satellite photo from February showing the Fordo uranium enrichment facility, south of Tehran. Credit...Maxar Tech/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAfter striking sites critical to Iran’s nuclear weapons program early on Friday, Israel indicated it would next set its sights on the enrichment site known as Fordo, Iran’s second-largest and most fortified nuclear complex.The Fordo site, built deep underground to thwart such an attack, is where Iran has stockpiled near weapons-grade uranium and could quickly produce a bomb, experts said. Fordo, they added, is Israel’s most formidable impediment to halting Iran’s nuclear program altogether.As Israel continued attacking Iran, Michael Leiter, Israel’s ambassador to the United States, confirmed his country’s intention to target the site.“The entire operation,” he told Fox News in an interview, “really has to be completed with the elimination of Fordo.”Here is what we know about the site:Where is the Fordo enrichment center?The facilities, buried deep underground in a mountain in the village of Fordo, are roughly 20 miles from the holy city of Qom.While it is likely that construction on the plant began as early as 2006, the existence of the site was publicly revealed in 2009.What is done there?Fordo is a uranium enrichment location where Iran has developed centrifuges to process weapons-grade uranium up to 60 percent purity, an amount far higher than the 3.7 percent purity levels needed for civilian use.The site was built to hold roughly up to 3,000 centrifuges, which spin quickly to produce fuel for nuclear weapons or reactors, said Richard Nephew, an Iran expert at the Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy.Iran, he said, had planned to install even more advanced centrifuges, called IR6s, that could process uranium three to five times more efficiently than the technology currently at the facility.Considering the facility’s size and configuration, Mr. Nephew said it was well-suited to producing weapons.“If you don’t deal with Fordo,” Mr. Nephew said, “it’s got enough centrifuges that it could produce a nuclear weapon pretty quickly.”Who runs the facility?While it is not exactly clear who manages operations at the facility, experts said it was likely that a combination of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization, the military and scientists at the plant were in charge.The security around the facility is maintained by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Mr. Nephew said.Can Israel destroy Fordo?Given the facility’s location and fortifications, it would be difficult for Israel to penetrate it with traditional strikes, said Daniel Shapiro, a security expert at the Atlantic Council.Compared to Natanz, the largest Iranian nuclear facility, which Israel struck early Friday, Fordo is much less exposed. Its destruction would require much more specific bunker-busting equipment.“If you were to just sort of drop bombs on it, it wouldn’t penetrate it,” Mr. Nephew said.However, even if Israel doesn’t breach the parts deepest underground, it still may be able to make Fordo inaccessible, by destroying the entrance to it.Experts agreed that a plan to disable the site — perhaps a combination of special and covert operations, they said — would be essential to stopping Iran’s nuclear program.“The Israelis have got a multiday campaign plan,” Mr. Nephew said. “It is inconceivable to me that Israelis would launch this attack without an idea of how to deal with Fordo.”",
