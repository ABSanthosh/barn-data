  "text": "PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron signaled Thursday that he had hosted a “positive and constructive” discussion among senior European, American and Ukrainian officials working to broker a deal with Russia to halt the fighting in Ukraine, though there was no immediate sign of a breakthrough.The hastily convened talks in Paris, announced only a day earlier, marked the start of what appears to be a concerted European effort to intercede in U.S.-led negotiations to end the three-year-old war, after the Trump administration’s bid for rapprochement with Moscow has put the continent on edge.“We are demonstrating a European commitment and a willingness to work closely with the United States,” Macron wrote on social media after meetings concluded, dubbing Thursday “a day of diplomatic mobilization.” Talks are expected to resume next week in London, the French leader added, though it was not immediately clear whether Russia, which was not involved in this round of meetings, would participate.The Paris meetings coincided with growing tension between Washington and Europe over a variety of other issues, including the future of Iran’s nuclear program and the impact on Europe of Trump’s hyperaggressive trade policy.Thursday’s diplomacy was a boost of sorts for European leaders staking out a more direct role in talks that could significantly influence the continent’s future, but U.S. officials did not immediately embrace Macron’s enthusiasm. “The French being happy is fabulous,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters in Washington. “What matters is the end result.”Secretary of State Marco Rubio led the U.S. delegation that took part in the talks at Élysée Palace. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, the U.S. envoy for the Ukraine war, and Steve Witkoff, another special envoy who is fresh off a visit to Moscow, joined him there. Neither official issued public remarks following Thursday’s meeting.Ukraine’s chief European backers have sought to ramp up pressure on Moscow, declaring that Russian President Vladimir Putin owes President Donald Trump an answer on the U.S. leader’s bid to secure a full ceasefire. European officials also have tried to mediate between Washington and Kyiv, and to persuade the Trump administration to take a tougher line on Russia, as a fragile 30-day deal in which the two sides agreed to pause attacks on each other’s energy infrastructure nears its end.Rubio met with the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany, and separately with a delegation from Ukraine led by Andriy Yermak, who heads Volodymyr Zelensky’s presidential office, and the country’s foreign and defense ministers.Rubio also spoke by phone with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday, the State Department announced after the talks in Paris.“The Secretary conveyed to his Russian counterpart the same message the U.S. team communicated to the Ukrainian delegation and our European allies in Paris: President Trump and the United States want this war to end, and have now presented to all parties the outlines of a durable and lasting peace,” Bruce, the State Department spokesperson, said in a statement.The 30-day energy truce, put forward by the United States and intended to pave the way for a full ceasefire and peace talks, has yet to yield a wider cessation of hostilities in Ukraine. On Palm Sunday, a Russian missile attack killed 35 people and wounded more than 100, mostly civilians, in the city of Sumy.The strike on Sumy came two days after Witkoff’s latest visit to Russia, which included a meeting with Putin. Rubio issued a statement of condolence for the victims, but some Ukrainians were upset that it did not condemn Russia, while Trump’s description of it as a “mistake” rankled many.Speaking from Kyiv on Thursday, Zelensky repeated his criticism of Witkoff’s approach, accusing the U.S. envoy of having adopted Russian narratives. He thanked Macron for his “leadership” and said he talked to the French president twice Thursday.Lasting peace would “directly depend on the fairness of positions in diplomacy and the effectiveness of the security architecture,” Zelensky said in a statement.Russian officials rejected any criticism of the U.S.’s handling of negotiations. “Many people, agencies, countries are trying to disrupt our dialogue with the United States. Propaganda against Russia is going very actively in the United States in various mass media,” Kirill Dmitriev, Putin’s chief negotiator and head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, told reporters in Moscow.Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Putin, said Russia hopes the U.S. will convey the contents of recent U.S.-Russia talks. “What we see from the Europeans is a focus on continuing the war,” he added.While Trump has pushed to negotiate with Russia, France and Britain have worked to consolidate a Western coalition to offer security guarantees for Ukraine. The two countries dispatched military planners there this month.They are drawing up plans for a “reassurance force” of some 25,000 troops that could deploy away from the front line in Ukraine if there is a settlement. Other scenarios feature a bigger role for air and sea power, with a smaller European contingent that could provide training and logistics support to the Ukrainian army.Even as they make those plans and say that allies have indicated their readiness to contribute logistics or equipment, the French-British campaign to persuade other European powers to publicly commit troops has faltered in the face of doubts that Washington is willing to back such a force.Russia has opposed the deployment of troops from other countries in Ukraine.European officials hope not just for U.S. involvement to help deter Russia from attacking their troops, but also U.S. intelligence and air support. They say the Trump administration has not ruled anything out, though it has offered no concrete promises.The Trump administration has made clear that it expects Europe to take the lead in securing Ukraine’s future and the continent’s defenses.In Ukraine, frustrations are mounting over the lack of credible progress on a ceasefire.Artem Kuznetsov, the deputy mayor of Sumy, said in an interview after this week’s attack that he was once encouraged by Trump’s interest in finding an immediate path to ending the war but has noticed his rhetoric shift since taking office. The energy ceasefire, he said, was not a legitimate truce.“I don’t believe our enemy stopped hitting energy objects. They are intent on killing us, whether it’s energy stations or civilians — they don’t care,” he said.Francis reported from Brussels. Siobhán O’Grady in Kyiv contributed to this report.",
