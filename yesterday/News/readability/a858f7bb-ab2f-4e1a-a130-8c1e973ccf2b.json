Musk has already outlined ambitious plans to shrink the number of federal agencies from over 400 to just 99. The initiative aims to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,\" Trump said in earlier remarks.While Miller is one of the first named members, Musk and Ramaswamy have yet to unveil the full team. However, their vision has drawn both support and criticism for its bold approach to dismantling what they describe as an \"unaccountable bureaucracy.\"Miller’s current roleKatie Miller is currently serving as the spokesperson for the transition team of Robert Kennedy Jr, Trump’s designated Health and Human Services secretary. Her dual roles highlight her increasing influence as the Trump administration prepares to take office.Her appointment reflects Trump's strategy of relying on trusted allies with proven loyalty and experience.
