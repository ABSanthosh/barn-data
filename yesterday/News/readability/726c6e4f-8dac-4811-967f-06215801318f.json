  "text": "The Trump administration is pressing the United Nations, aid organizations and U.S. allies to participate in new Israeli plan to resume distribution of limited amounts of humanitarian assistance in Gaza under conditions that Jerusalem will strictly control, according to aid officials and other people familiar with internal discussions.The U.S. effort comes as the United Nations and virtually all other organizations have refused to participate in a plan they have described as against “fundamental humanitarian principles” and violating international law.The office of the U.N. coordinator for humanitarian affairs made that position official in a briefing paper circulated to aid partners over the last 24 hours. “After careful consideration, consultation and analysis” it said, they all have “decided not to participate in this modality.”The statement drew a harsh response from Israel. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Danny Danon, Israel’s U.N. ambassador, said that “instead of having a dialogue with us or trying to understand what is the proposal ... the U.N. decided to put out a statement that they will not engage.”Danon repeated Israeli charges, widely disputed by aid organizations and U.S. officials, that Hamas has been engaged in “mass stealing of humanitarian aid.” The United Nations and Secretary General António Guterres, he said, “chose to walk away.”Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump’s Mideast envoy, met with members of the U.N. Security Council at the U.S. mission to the United Nations on Wednesday to discuss the Gaza plan. The administration has held a number of meetings with aid organizations who have been involved in Gaza relief operations in recent days. Another group of aid organizations based in Europe has been invited to a meeting with U.S. officials in Geneva on Thursday, aid officials said.Administration officials declined to comment on efforts to gain approval for the Israeli aid proposal. Trump said Monday that people in Gaza “are starving and we are going to help them get some food.”Trump, who said during his presidential campaign that he would bring a quick end to the Gaza crisis, plans to travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates next week. On Wednesday, he told reporters to expect a major announcement on Gaza “probably in the next 24 hours.”Israel declared a blockade on Gaza after the collapse of a brief ceasefire in March. No food or other supplies have been allowed to enter the enclave for two months. Under its newly formulated plan, a limited amount of supplies would be vetted by Israel and allowed to travel along designated corridors to Israeli-constructed distribution hubs. Both the corridors and the hubs are to be guarded by private U.S. security contractors.The initiative is designed to depend on the United Nations — and particularly the U.N. World Food Program — and humanitarian nongovernmental organizations already working in Gaza to distribute food packets at the hubs to Israeli-vetted Palestinians.The program is to be administered by an umbrella organization called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a nonprofit newly registered in Switzerland that has been set up by unnamed governments and entities to funnel money into the effort, including paying the American security contractors.A statement by the Geneva-based organization distributed Wednesday provided no information about its origins, backers or relationship with Israel. “GHF was established to restore that vital lifeline through an independent, rigorously-audited model that gets assistance directly — and only — to those in need.”Its initial goal is to set up four “secure distribution sites,” each of which would serve 300,000 people, and reach “1.2 million Gazans in the first phase with capacity to expand beyond 2 million.” Israel Defense Forces personnel “will not be present near distribution sites,” it said.“Aid distribution is based solely on need — without eligibility requirements or regard to identity, origin, or affiliation — prioritizing community dignity and safety,” the statement said.But nongovernmental aid organizations and people familiar with the Israeli plans said the scale and conditions described were far from what they have been told about the initial stages of the plan, which would vet participants and feed fewer than 200,000 people.The aid distribution will serve only southern Gaza, where a new Israeli military strategy, separately approved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet over the weekend, plans to relocate most of Gaza’s more than 2 million people while it escalates operations against what it says are Hamas militants still operating in the enclave.“It’s not a trial run,” said one person familiar with Israeli plans. “That’s where the population is going to end up.”As food warehouses have emptied over the past several weeks and rising levels of severe malnutrition have been reported, a number of aid organizations have shut down operations in Gaza.World Central Kitchen (WCK), the Washington-based organization headed by internationally renown chef José Andrés, announced Wednesday that it “no longer has the supplies to cook meals and bake bread in Gaza.” WCK said that its trucks, loaded with food and cooking fuel, have been ready at the Gazan border since early March but “our vital work cannot continue without permission from Israel for this aid to enter.”Chief Executive Officer Erin Gore said in an interview Wednesday that WCK joined the United Nations and other organizations in rejecting participation in the Israeli plan. “It goes against our humanitarian principles,” Gore said. “It doesn’t allow us to feed with dignity.” Another senior WCK official said that position had been communicated to the Trump administration in meetings with the State Department.Asked about U.S. pressure to join the Israeli program, a spokesperson for the World Food Program — where the United States remains a major donor, despite recent cuts by the Trump administration — referred to U.N. statements rejecting the initiative.“I think WFP are having the worst possible time,” an official at a European aid agency said. “All of their U.S. funding worldwide is on the line.”",
