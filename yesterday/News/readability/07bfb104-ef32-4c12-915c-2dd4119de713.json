  "text": "TEL AVIV — Four female Israeli soldiers held hostage were released by Hamas in Gaza City and 200 Palestinian prisoners were released by Israel on Saturday, the start of a second week of a planned six-week ceasefire deal that has halted 15 months of fighting and allowed Hamas to project an image of resilience. Hours before releasing the hostages, the militants paraded the women, dressed in army green, in a public square in Gaza and forced them to climb a stage, smile and raise their arms for a gaggle of cameramen.The hostages were then transferred to the Red Cross vans that would take them home to Israel. At the Israeli military facility at the border, at the hospital waiting to receive them and at viewing parties across the country, parents, siblings and friends of the women — Liri Albag, 19, Naama Levy, 20, Karina Ariev, 20, and Daniella Gilboa, 20 — wept with joy at seeing them walking on their own.Four Israeli female soldiers reunited with their families in Reim, Israel after being released by Hamas on Jan. 25. (Video: The Washington Post)Later Saturday, 200 Palestinian prisoners were released from the Ofer and Ketziot prisons as part of the ceasefire agreement, a spokesperson for the Israel Prison Service said. Among them was Wael Qassem, the leader of a Hamas cell in East Jerusalem and one of the most prominent of some 120 prisoners serving life sentences who were included in the ceasefire deal, according to an organization that represents Palestinian prisoners. Qassem received 35 life terms for involvement in deadly attacks against Israelis during the second intifada, the mass Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s.200 Palestinian prisoners arrived in the West Bank on Jan. 25 after being released by Israel. (Video: AP)In Israel, relatives of the four hostages expressed an overwhelming sense of relief at their return. Gilboa’s family thanked people for their “prayers and support.”“We couldn’t have made it through without you,” the family said in a statement shared by the Hostage Families Forum.“Our hearts are filled with immense gratitude and joy,” Ariev’s family said. “Our Karina is a symbol of courage, heart, and determination, and we are proud of her beyond words.”“This is a very happy moment for which we have waited a long time,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Albag’s parents in a phone call.The deal requires Israel to partially withdraw its troops to facilitate the movement of hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip. At Netzarim Corridor, a four-mile road that Israel paved during the war to divide the Strip in two, long lines of people were gathering Saturday afternoon in anticipation of the opening.But Israel said Saturday that Hamas had violated the agreement by failing to release all living civilian women first. Israel had expected that Arbel Yehud, a 29-year-old civilian who was abducted with her boyfriend from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas attack of Oct. 7, 2023, would be among those in the release Saturday.Netanyahu’s office said Israeli forces will not begin withdrawing from the Strip until Yehud’s release “is arranged.”Hamas accused Israel of preventing displaced people from returning to northern Gaza, as agreed. Israel delayed holding up its end of the deal, the militant group said in a statement, and so was “responsible for any disruption” in its implementation.The four female soldiers who were released Saturday were among the first hostages abducted Oct. 7, when Hamas-led forces streamed out of Gaza, killed some 1,200 people in Israel and dragged about 250 people back to the enclave. Hamas recorded video of the first hours of the assault on the women’s base that showed them handcuffed against the wall, in pajamas and covered in blood. The video, rereleased by the families in May to increase pressure on the Israeli government to reach a deal for the return of hostages, has been one of the most powerful symbols of the Israeli military and intelligence failures that led to the surprise attack.Albag, Levy, Ariev and Gilboa were taken hostage with three other female soldiers: Agam Berger, who is presumed alive and still in captivity in Gaza; Noa Marciano, who was killed by her captors near al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, according to Israel Defense Forces assessments, and whose body has been repatriated to Israel; and Ori Megidish, who was rescued by the Israeli military in October 2023.The hostage release Saturday followed a similar, though more chaotic, hostage transfer on Sunday, when Emily Damari, Doron Steinbrecher and Romi Gonen were recorded being pushed through throngs of Gazans shouting “Allahu akbar” — God is the most great — and then handed over to representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross.The ceasefire deal, still in its early stages, is open-ended, which leaves in question future releases and Israel’s willingness to declare an end to the war in Gaza.It follows 15 months of agonizing uncertainty, in which most families of hostages received few or no signs that their loved ones were alive. Hamas released a video this month showing Albag, in army green, shaking and crying as she begged her parents not to forget her — psychological warfare intended to torture the families, Israeli officials said.Gal Cohen, who served in the hostages’ surveillance unit, joined dozens of former comrades Saturday in the Tel Aviv plaza known as Hostages Square, where supporters cheered at live news broadcasts reporting the homecoming. Cohen said the Hamas transfer, intended to show the militant group’s power, served instead to highlight the strength of the hostages after nearly 480 days in captivity.“Hamas believed they could humiliate them,” Cohen said, smiling, “but the women came out victorious.”Concern remained for Berger, 20, the last female soldier held in Gaza.“We eagerly await embracing Agam, God willing, in the coming week,” her family said Saturday in a statement.“This day is extremely happy,” Cohen said. “But we are also very, very worried for Agam, who has been left behind, still surrounded by Hamas gunmen.”The national euphoria of the past two weeks has been tempered by dread over the fate of the dozens of hostages who remain captive. Most are not slated for release during the initial phase of the agreement, which is due to conclude in early March.Levy’s family said they would “not rest until the last hostage returns.” Albag’s family expressed pride in their daughter’s “superhuman strength” but said their hearts were “with the families of Arbel [Yehud], Agam Berger, the Bibas family, and all other hostages still waiting to return home.”Hamas had delayed the start of the ceasefire by several hours last week when it refused to hand over the list of the three women it intended to release. On Saturday, it informed Israel that it would release the four soldiers.“We are committed to all of the hostages who are still being held captive by Hamas in inhumane conditions,” said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the Israeli military. “The mission will not be completed until they are all returned to Israel.”Hagari reiterated that Israel considered Saturday’s hostage releases a violation of the deal, as Yehud remains in Gaza. Yehud is believed to be held by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group.Throughout the negotiations, Israel has demanded that Hamas be responsible for the handover of all agreed-upon hostages, including those held by other groups or by private families. Palestinian Islamic Jihad posted a video on social media Saturday saying it will release Israeli hostages in coordination with Hamas.Hamas has refused to hand over a list confirming which hostages are living or dead.Among the most prominent captives remaining are the Bibas children, the youngest hostages taken Oct. 7. Ariel was 4 years old when abducted; Kfir was 9 months old. Hamas live-streamed smartphone footage of their mother, Shiri, clutching the boys to her chest as she was forced into captivity.Israeli officials have notified the family that they have “serious concerns” for the well-being of Shiri and the children, but they have not been definitively declared dead.A picture of Kfir, a redheaded baby boy holding up a pink elephant doll, has been plastered across Israeli buildings and billboards for the past 15 months.Bibas family members prepared themselves, they said on social media Saturday, but when they learned that Shiri and her children were not slated for release, their “world collapsed.”“We will continue to hope and demand your release,” they vowed on Instagram. “It isn’t over until it’s over.”Craw reported from London.
