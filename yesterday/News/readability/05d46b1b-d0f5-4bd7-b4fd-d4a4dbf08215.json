  "text": "Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, has emerged as an unlikely participant in one of the Trump administration’s most audacious acts. Bukele accepted more than 200 Venezuelans deported from the United States last week and locked them up in a draconian prison. With no access to the courts, they are in a legal black hole.The deportation has become one of the most dramatic tests of the rule of law in recent U.S. history. President Donald Trump dusted off an 18th-century wartime act to remove many of the Venezuelan migrants, accusing them of belonging to a gang on the U.S. terrorist list, the Tren de Aragua. But they have not faced trial. Some of their relatives deny the gang allegations, saying the men simply had tattoos. A U.S. judge demanded a halt to the transfer; the Trump administration went ahead with it anyway, calling the judicial order “an intrusion on the president’s authority.”Bukele might seem an odd partner for Trump in the high-stakes showdown. He leads a poor country of 6 million inhabitants — fewer than in New York City. El Salvador is heavily dependent on money sent from immigrants in the U.S. And U.S. prosecutors have stated that Bukele’s own government has cut deals with Salvadorans facing terrorism charges in American courts.How did he become the man at the center of the deal?Bukele wants to be seen as a hemispheric leaderBukele, 43, a bitcoin enthusiast known for his leather jackets and backward baseball caps, has jokingly referred to himself as the “world’s coolest dictator.” He has tamed violence in what had been one of the world’s most dangerous countries, plagued by the vicious MS-13 and 18th Street gangs. That has made Bukele wildly popular.But he has been accused of committing widespread human rights abuses. He has locked up at least 85,000 people since declaring emergency rule in 2022, giving his country one of the highest incarceration rates in the world. Most of those accused of gang ties have not been tried in court and have no right to an attorney. More than 370 people have died in overcrowded prisons with insufficient water and hygiene, according to investigations by Cristosal, a human rights group.Bukele overwhelmingly won reelection last year despite a constitutional ban on successive terms for presidents. The Supreme Court’s constitutional chamber approved his candidacy after the ruling party replaced its members with judges sympathetic to Bukele.The president clearly relishes his image as a crime fighter. He has reposted on his X account a stream of favorable comments from members of the Trump administration. One, from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, praised El Salvador’s “very good jails” and called Bukele “the strongest security leader in our region.”“He views himself as an international leader, and his ego is extremely hurt by the correct perception by many that he’s a human rights abuser and an authoritarian,” said Eric Jacobstein, who served as a deputy assistant secretary of state overseeing Central America in the Biden administration.In offering Trump the use of his infamous mega-prison — the Terrorism Confinement Center — to hold the Venezuelans, Bukele is “legitimizing a prison system that systematically violates human rights,” said Noah Bullock, executive director of Cristosal.Presidential spokeswoman Wendy Ramos did not respond to a request for comment.Bukele is trying to get Salvadoran gang leaders backLast month, Bukele told Rubio that his country would accept migrants removed in Trump’s “mass deportation” program — even if they weren’t from El Salvador. Other countries, including Mexico and Panama, made similar agreements.But Bukele went further. He posted on X that he had offered the U.S. “the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system” to El Salvador, “in exchange for a fee.”We have offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system.We are willing to take in only convicted criminals (including convicted U.S. citizens) into our mega-prison (CECOT) in exchange for a fee.The fee would be relatively low for… pic.twitter.com/HTNwtp35Aq— Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) February 4, 2025 In return, Bukele told Rubio he wanted several Salvadoran gang leaders detained in the U.S. sent back, according to his ambassador in Washington, Milena Mayorga. “I think it’s a question of honor,” she told “Diálogo con Ernesto López,” a news program.Some say Bukele is trying to hide his government’s own involvement with the gangs.More than two dozen high-ranking Salvadoran gang leaders have been charged with terrorism and other crimes in a Justice Department investigation that has lasted years. Several of them are jailed in the United States. One of the indictments details how senior members of Bukele’s government held secret negotiations with gang leaders after his 2019 election. The gang members wanted financial benefits, control of territory and better jail conditions, the court documents say. In exchange, they agreed to tamp down homicides in public areas and to pressure neighborhoods under their control to support Bukele’s party in midterm elections, according to the 2022 indictment.Bukele’s government went so far as to free a top MS-13 leader, Elmer Canales Rivera, or “Crook,” from a Salvadoran prison, according to the documents — even though the U.S. government had asked for his extradition. (He was later captured in Mexico and sent to the U.S.)Last weekend, the Trump administration sent back one of the MS-13 leaders named in the indictments, César Humberto López Larios, alias “Greñas,” along with the 238 Venezuelans and nearly two dozen other Salvadorans allegedly tied to gangs.Some Salvadoran analysts believe Bukele wants the gang leaders back so they won’t testify about his government’s involvement with them — and potentially put him in legal trouble.“If these returns [of Salvadoran gang members] continue, it takes away the possibility that the U.S. judicial system will open a case against Bukele for negotiations and agreements with terrorist groups,” said Juan Martínez d’Aubuisson, an anthropologist who has studied the gangs.Bukele has denied making deals with gangs. Such negotiations by his predecessors were highly unpopular domestically.Bukele would like to be on Trump’s good sideEl Salvador is one of numerous Latin American countries that have sought to please Trump by stressing their actions against irregular migration and drug-trafficking. Bukele had a positive relationship with the U.S. leader during his first term. But Trump took a dig at his counterpart during his campaign.He noted that the Salvadoran government had reported a 70 percent drop in homicides in 2023. The numbers had declined “because they’re sending their murderers to the United States,” Trump said. (El Salvador denied the allegation.)Bukele has been keen to strengthen the relationship. In exchange, he has a long wish list for Washington.It includes trying to maintain a program known as “temporary protected status” for about 232,000 Salvadorans in the U.S. That program allows them to live and work legally because of the difficulties they’d face returning home in the wake of devastating storms in recent years. In January, the Biden administration said it would extend the program for Salvadorans for 18 months. But Trump has rolled back TPS for Haitians and Venezuelans — and El Salvador could be targeted, too.That may be devastating for El Salvador. Remittances from workers abroad — mostly in the U.S. — make up about one-quarter of its GDP.The country’s heavily indebted government also has to figure out how to pay for its vast jail system. It received $6 million for one year of detention for the Venezuelans who arrived last week, a relatively modest sum. But that could grow. The Associated Press cited a State Department document indicating it may provide $15 million to El Salvador to house additional alleged gang members.“The fee would be relatively low for the U.S. but significant for us,” Bukele said after Rubio’s visit — “making our entire prison system sustainable.”Valentina Muñoz Castillo contributed to this report.",
