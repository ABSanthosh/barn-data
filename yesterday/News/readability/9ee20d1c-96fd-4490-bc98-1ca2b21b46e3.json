  "text": "Here’s the latest.Robert Francis Prevost was elected the 267th pope of the Roman Catholic Church on Thursday, becoming the first pope from the United States and defying a longstanding belief that church leaders would never select a pope from a global superpower that already has considerable influence in world affairs.He took the name Pope Leo XIV, and used his first words from a Vatican balcony to speak of peace in the world and “a united church, always seeking peace and justice.” He will soon confront difficult decisions affecting the direction of the church and the world’s 1.4 billion Roman Catholics.As ideological camps tussled before the conclave over whether to continue the inclusive agenda of the last pope, Francis, or return to a conservative doctrinal path, supporters had pitched then-Cardinal Prevost, 69, as a balanced alternative. In his first remarks to the crowd that had gathered in St. Peter’s Square, Leo put great emphasis on the need to build bridges.His election was greeted with rejoicing in Vatican City but also in Chicago, where he was born, and in Peru, where he served for more than two decades. President Trump called his selection “a great honor” for the United States.The cardinals reached their decision after being in conclave for a little more than 24 hours, and after several rounds of voting. The group of 133 cardinals, the most ever to gather in a conclave, included many who were appointed by Francis and some who did not know one another. That had made reaching a quick consensus a serious challenge, given the broad group of contenders and the splits among them about the future of the church.Here’s what to know:Who is Pope Leo XIV? Despite his American roots, Leo, a Chicago-born polyglot, is a churchman who transcends borders. He served for two decades in Peru, where he became a bishop and a naturalized citizen, and then was appointed to one of the most influential posts at the Vatican by Francis, who made him a cardinal in 2023.

Art Purcaro, an assistant vice president and adjunct professor at Villanova University, had traveled to Italy to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his ordination as a priest. He planned to have dinner with his family at Sor’Eva, a traditional Roman restaurant on the Tiber, not far from Vatican City. And he wanted his good friend Cardinal Prevost, known to him simply as Bob, to join.The cardinal was unable to attend dinner because of the Novemdiales, the nine days of mourning and Masses that were being held in honor of Pope Francis, who died on April 21.But then as dinner was wrapping up, Father Purcaro recalled, in walked Bob. He held a black umbrella as he battled a rainy evening outside.“This is the type of person Bob Prevost is,” Father Purcaro said in a phone interview on Thursday. “He just popped in.”The two priests have known each other for decades. They worked together in Peru, and later spent time together working in Rome. Father Purcaro eventually returned to Villanova — the same school that the pope attended as an undergraduate.Father Purcaro described the new pope as an unambitious person, both reserved and prayerful.“Some people would stress the reserved aspect of his personality, but that does not get across who Bob is,” he said.“Bob cares very much about people, especially those who have been left out,” he added, noting that came through in their work in Peru.He praised his friend’s willingness “to leave behind any personal ambition, his family, his abilities, to put them to the service of others, to go to a foreign nation, to become a bishop in a foreign country and to become a Peruvian citizen so he could serve as one for the people.”Another longtime friend, the Rev. Robert Hagan, said that Robert Prevost was his mentor and superior when he was studying to become a priest in Racine, Wis., in the late 1990s.They watched Chicago Bulls games together, and over the years checked in about the success of the men’s basketball team at Villanova, which they both attended.“He had a twinkle in his eye, a serenity in his face. He’s a man who is centered. He wasn’t about the drama. He was calm,” said Father Hagan, who is now prior provincial in charge of the St. Augustinian order in the Philadelphia area.Hours after the new pope was announced, Father Hagan still had trouble keeping his friend’s new name straight. “I think of him as Bob,” he said, adding that he was trying to retrain himself. “When he appeared on that balcony, it was as if a family member appeared.”Interest in Pope Leo XIV, and in the people who knew him earlier in his life has been intense. A few hours after the pope was announced, Father Hagan said he received 351 texts and 400 emails about the news.But he never saw a careerist plotting an ascent to power.“The papacy is certainly not something that I could ever see Bob Prevost aspire to,” Father Hagan said. “I think he was just doing what he felt God was calling him to do.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhat does Pope Leo XIV do now?ImagePope Leo XIV on the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica on Thursday with, from left, Archbishop Diego Giovanni Ravelli, Cardinal Pietro Parolin and Cardinal Vinko Puljić.Credit...Domenico Stinellis/Associated PressThe highly choreographed and secretive process of electing a pope technically came to an end when Pope Leo XIV was introduced on Thursday.But the oath of secrecy is frequently, and unofficially, kept for just a bit longer, according to Joelle Rollo-Koster, a professor of history at the University of Rhode Island.“We can only imagine — with an educated imagination” exactly what happens when the pope returns to the halls of St. Peter’s Basilica, Dr. Rollo-Koster said.Indeed, the next few days in the pope’s life will be a mix of private decisions and public presentations.The Vatican said that Pope Leo XIV will celebrate Mass on Friday at the Sistine Chapel with the cardinals who voted for him. On Sunday, he will recite the Regina Coeli at St. Peter’s Basilica.The end of the conclave does not mean the end of politicking. In addition to sharing congratulations, cardinals who elected the pope may more explicitly share why they voted for him, and what kind of leadership they want to see as a result.On Monday, he is scheduled to meet with journalists at the Vatican for the first time as pope.Pope Leo XIV must also soon decide where he wants to live. While most popes choose to live in the Apostolic Palace, Pope Francis chose to live in the Vatican guesthouse. The Vatican shared Pope Francis’s choice of residence about two weeks after he was elected.Peru rejoices over the new pope and claims him as their own.ImageThe Vatican’s flag fluttering at the Metropolitan Cathedral in Lima, Peru after Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost was elected pontiff on the second day of the conclave on Thursday.Credit...Juan Carlos Mandujano/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesWhile Pope Leo XIV made global headlines for becoming the first American pope, he is also a citizen of Peru, a country where he spent a significant part of his career and where his election was celebrated as the elevation of one of their own. “Many people here are very moved,” said the Rev. Elmer Uchofen, a priest in Chiclayo, where the pope served as bishop. “We are very excited. All the people have jumped. They have rejoiced in this church.”The bells of the Catholic cathedral in Lima, the capital, rang when the news of the pope’s election was announced. Pope Leo XIV, who lived in the impoverished coastal city for nine years until moving to Rome in 2023, addressed “my beloved diocese of Chiclayo in Peru, where a faithful people have accompanied their bishop” in his first speech in Vatican City as pontiff. Robert Francis Prevost first moved to Peru in 1985 as a missionary working in remote rural regions at a time when the country was plagued by violence fomented by the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla movement that spread terror and death during the 1980s and ’90s. He returned to the United States in 1998, but went back to Peru in 2014, to serve in Chiclayo and was soon appointed bishop and eventually became a Peruvian citizen.Those in the church who knew him in Peru described him as kind, patient and devoted to helping the poor. He was heavily involved with Caritas, a nonprofit that focuses on serving the poor that is operated by the church, and he worked in areas that experienced frequent flooding. He often delivered food and other supplies to residents, carrying bags of rice on his back, Father Uchofen said. He sought to get to know as many people as possible in the 50 parishes he oversaw as bishop, and it was a bittersweet moment when Pope Francis summoned him to Rome to lead the Vatican department that oversees the selection of bishops. “He was always aware of how we were doing in Chiclayo, helping us a lot” he said. The new pope is concerned about the poor and “sees the world and the church from that perspective,” said the Rev. Peter Hughes, an Irish missionary priest who has lived in Lima for decades and works on environmental and Indigenous issues. “At the same time, he’s kind of low-key, at least he was up until today,’’ he said. “He’s not a man that easily makes waves.”ImageIn this photo released by the Cruz de Motupe Brotherhood, Bishop Robert Prevost blesses a parishioner during a Mass in Motupe, Peru, in 2020.Credit...Cruz de Motupe Brotherhood, via Associated PressLike other church leaders, he became embroiled in a clergy sexual abuse scandal during his time in Chiclayo. One woman in Chiclayo who said she and two other women were sexually abused by two priests as girls long before Cardinal Prevost was bishop accused him of mishandling an investigation and of not stopping one of the priests from celebrating Mass.Father Uchofen and Rev. Hughes said they thought the new pope held many of the same progressive values as Pope Francis and would continue his work of reforming the church and advocating for society’s most vulnerable people. But Rev. Hughes predicted the new pope would do it “in a rather quiet way, not very spectacular.”“He will not be a flamboyant personality like Francisco by any means. He may not be very comfortable with crowds,” Rev. Hughes said. “But who knows, he may grow into the job. He’s a surprising man.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTLiberals express cautious optimism about new pope’s views on gay Catholics.ImagePope Leo XIV does not have a clear track record on L.G.B.T.Q. issues, church observers said.Credit...Gianni Cipriano for The New York TimesPope Leo XIV ascended to the papacy on Thursday with little public record on L.G.B.T.Q. issues, a signature concern of his predecessor, Pope Francis, as well as a source of deep conflict between liberal and conservative Catholics.Nevertheless, proponents of greater inclusion for gay and transgender people in the church said they were cautiously optimistic, even if they might not know much about the man who will now lead the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics. Until today, few people believed an American pope was a possibility.“We are sitting here Googling everything we can about the new pope,” said Francis DeBernardo, who runs New Ways Ministry, a Maryland-based group that promotes L.G.B.T.Q. inclusion in the church. “I think he is the best we could have hoped for.”The Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit writer and well-known proponent of outreach to L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics, said he was “stunned” that an American had been chosen, but that he “rejoiced in the selection” of the new pope, whom he had met socially in the past.“I know him to be a down-to-earth, kind, modest, reserved guy, hardworking, decisive, not afraid of speaking his mind,” Father Martin said in a statement. “It is a great choice.”Pope Francis was praised by admirers for his openness to members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, his support for those who provided them with ministry and spiritual guidance, and for the ways in which he changed the church’s tone — if not always its doctrine — on issues of gender and sexuality.Pope Leo has spent most of his career in rural Peru and has never drawn wide attention for his positions on those issues. But reports that he had made scattered comments in the past that were critical of gay and transgender people had left some in the L.G.B.T.Q. community nervously reading the tea leaves on Thursday.Mr. DeBernardo said he thought L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics should take a “wait and see approach” to Pope Leo, who he said had never really appeared on his organization’s radar in its years of closely tracking the positions of church leaders.Still, he said it was worrying that Leo had made unfriendly remarks in the past, including a 2012 speech in which he criticized the positive portrayal of the “homosexual lifestyle” in the Western media, which he said fostered “sympathy for beliefs and practices that are at odds with the Gospel.”But Mr. DeBernardo said that the world is different now than it was in 2012, when opposition to many elements of gay rights remained widespread. President Barack Obama, for example, announced that year that he had changed his position to support same-sex marriage. “A lot can change in 13 years,” Mr. DeBernardo said.ImageA visitor posed with a Pride flag in front of St. Peter’s Basilica last month.Credit...Carlos Barria/Reuters“When Francis was elected, it immediately came out that he had opposed marriage equality in Argentina in pretty strong terms,” Mr. DeBernardo said. “So when it comes to the comments Pope Leo made about the ‘homosexual lifestyle,’ we are hoping that in the intervening 13 years that maybe he has opened up a little more on these issues.”During that time, Pope Leo moved from a rural area in northern Peru to the heart of Rome, where he oversaw a Vatican office that helped Pope Francis vet and appoint a significant number of bishops who are seen as supportive of L.G.B.T.Q. inclusion in the church. He is also a Chicago native who is reputed to be close with Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago, whom many consider one of the most open-minded cardinals in the American church.Those clues do not add up to a strong endorsement of any one view, Mr. DeBernardo acknowledged.“If I was going to predict anything, I would predict that he is not going to clamp down on L.G.B.T.Q. acceptance, but he probably will not support it in the way Francis did,” he said. “I do not think this will actively be part of Leo’s agenda.”Brian Flanagan, a Catholic theologian at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs at Georgetown University, said that Leo “does not seem to me like a pope who is going to turn things backward.”Mr. Flanagan said the new pope’s early remarks were especially heartening because of their embrace of synodality, a way of governing the church that Francis favored, and which includes input from lay people.“For me, synodality is really important because it creates a structure by which the entire Catholic Church can hear the voices of L.G.B.T.Q. Catholics,” he said. “I am hoping that provides the space for the Catholic Church to continue to have a conversation about how sexuality and gender might be more complicated than we used to think they were.”Michael Sennett, a master’s student in pastoral care at Fordham University, was part of a delegation of transgender and intersex people who traveled to Rome last October for an audience with Pope Francis. Mr. Sennett said he was deeply affected by the new pope’s emotional greeting of the crowd at the Vatican on Thursday.“The way Pope Leo was so moved today when he was standing on that balcony, delivering a message of love and unity — it reminded me so much of the spirit I felt when I was in Rome to meet Pope Francis,” he said. “I think the church continues to be in good hands.”Pope Leo’s choice of his papal name also seems to indicate that he will continue the pastoral approach of Francis, who dedicated his papacy to reaching out to people on the margins of society, Father Martin said.The new pope’s name appeared to be a tribute to Pope Leo XIII, the 19th-century pontiff who laid the groundwork for Catholic social teaching, which emphasizes a concern for the welfare of the sick and the poor.But as much as the name may point to an interest in social justice, it may also indicate a focus on the issues that matter to people in poor or war-torn countries, where gay rights are not high on the agenda, Mr. DeBernardo said.There is an irony, he said, in the idea that the first American pope may also be a pontiff who is less concerned with American culture-war issues.“For so many bishops around the world, their main concerns are things like refugees and starvation, and L.G.B.T.Q. issues are just not a pressing concern for their people,” he said.A New Orleans genealogist says the new pope has Creole roots.ImagePope Leo XIV, formerly known as Cardinal Robert F. Prevost, celebrating a mass at St. Jude Parish in New Lenox, Ill., last year.Credit...via Midwest Augustinian Province of Our Mother of Good CounselRobert Francis Prevost, the Chicago-born cardinal selected on Thursday as the next pope, is partially descended from Creole people of color, according to Jari C. Honora, a noted genealogist and historian.Mr. Honora works at the Historic New Orleans Collection, a museum in the French Quarter, and was a researcher on the TV show “Finding Your Roots” with the historian Henry Louis Gates Jr.Mr. Honora said in an interview that he found evidence that the new pope’s maternal grandparents were Joseph Martinez and Louise Baquié, of New Orleans. In a Facebook post, he displayed records of a marriage certificate with those two names.He said he had also reviewed a photo of Martinez’s grave marker in Chicago, where their daughter — Mildred Martinez, the pope’s mother — was born.It’s unclear whether the new pope, who took the name Leo XIV, has ever addressed his ancestry in public, interviews or his writings. The records show that couple married at Our Lady of the Sacred Heart in New Orleans. Until it was destroyed by a hurricane in 1915, the church’s building was on Annette Street in the city’s Seventh Ward, a historic center of Louisiana’s Afro-Creole culture.The word “Creole” has multiple meanings in a Louisiana context. It can refer to people of European descent who were born in the Americas. But it also commonly refers to mixed-race people of color.Many of these Louisianians were known in the 18th and 19th centuries as “gens de couleur libres,” or free people of color. Many were well educated, French-speaking and Roman Catholic.Over the decades, they established a foothold in business, the building trades and the arts, particularly music, with significant contributions to the development of jazz. They continue to be an important strand in the city’s famously heterogeneous culture.Lolita Villavasso Cherrie, a co-founder with Mr. Honora of The Creole Genealogical and Historical Association, said that the research appeared to signal a tremendous moment for the history of Louisiana Creoles, if a branch of the pope’s family tree indeed stretched back to New Orleans.“It would be so fabulous to have someone who has some connection to our people, who give us the recognition we deserve,” said Ms. Villavasso Cherrie, 79, a retired teacher. “I hate to say it, but we feel, many of us, that our history was hidden from us.”That is in part, she said, because many Creoles have been able to “pass” as white over the years. It was only with the advent of the internet, she said, that many people began to research their family history and became aware of their Creole roots.Ms. Villavasso Cherrie noted that in the 20th century, a significant number of Louisiana Creoles migrated to the Chicago area and California.Mr. Honora said he began looking into Leo XIV’s family history because the name “Prevost” sounded French; he thought it might be of Canadian origin, and possibly connected to the Acadians, French-speaking people who relocated to Louisiana in the 19th century. He said he has not fully researched the origin of that name. Instead, he said, he found the maternal connection to New Orleans when reviewing his records. He had “no doubt,” he said, that his research was accurate.Mr. Honora, who is African American, Catholic and a New Orleans native, chuckled when asked how he felt while making what might be the most important discovery of his career.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAn urgent question for the pope: Cubs or Sox?ImageThe marquee at Wrigley Field declared that the new pope was a Cubs fan after his election on Thursday.Credit...Joshua MellinIn Chicago, a city where baseball allegiance has no middle ground, one of the first questions people asked was whether the Chicago-born pope cheered for the White Sox or the Cubs.The lines dividing Cubs and Sox fans are not always clear. Generally speaking, North Siders root for the Cubs, since Wrigley Field is on their side of the city. South Siders are usually loyal to the Sox, who play at Rate Field in Bridgeport, on the South Side. Suburbanites tend to follow the same geographical divisions, but are sometimes considered a gray area.Fans from both sides seemed to initially claim the new pope as their own. A spokeswoman for the Cubs first said that she could not confirm whether he was a fan, and issued a statement from Tom Ricketts, the executive chairman of the Cubs, assuring the new pope that he would be welcomed at Wrigley Field.ImageThe Wieners Circle added a Latin phrase to its sign to honor the new pope’s Chicago ties.Credit...Joshua Mellin“Not only would we welcome Pope Leo XIV to Wrigley Field, he could sing ‘Take Me Out to the Ball Game’ or, since three of his predecessors visited Yankee Stadium, including Pope Paul VI who delivered the 1965 ‘Sermon on the Mound,’ we would invite the pontiff to do the same at the Friendly Confines,” Mr. Ricketts said.By afternoon, the marquee at Wrigley Field declared that the new pope was a Cubs fan.But in suburban Chicago, the pope’s brother John Prevost set the record straight to WGN, a television station that for decades broadcast Cubs games and helped create a fan base far beyond Chicago.“He was never, ever a Cubs fan,” Mr. Prevost said. “So I don’t know where that came from. He was always a Sox fan.”Pope Leo XIV has voted often in Illinois, public records show.ImagePope Leo XIV, then known as Cardinal Robert F. Prevost, at a mass at St. Jude Parish in New Lenox, Ill., last year.Credit...via Midwest Augustinian Province of Our Mother of Good CounselPope Leo XIV has voted several times in his home state of Illinois in recent years, public records show, including with an absentee ballot in last November’s presidential election.According to records from Will County, in suburban Chicago, the pope has voted in three Republican primaries since 2012 and no Democratic primaries in that time. He most recently voted in a Republican primary in 2016.The records show that he did not vote in Will County in the 2020 presidential election or in the 2022 midterm election.In Illinois, where Democrats dominate in statewide elections, voters do not register as members of a political party. American citizens living outside the country remain eligible to vote.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAmerican church leaders signal support for Leo XIV and for the continuation of Francis’ priorities.ImageCardinal Seán P. O’Malley, right, with Cardinal Celestino Aós Braco in St Peter’s Square in Vatican City on Thursday after a new pope had been chosen.Credit...Luca Bruno/Associated PressThe earliest reactions from leaders of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States are starting to come in. Cardinal Seán P. O’Malley, the archbishop emeritus of Boston who was one of Pope Francis’ top advisers, offered strong support for Pope Leo XIV, signaling that cardinals close to Pope Francis believe his priorities and reforms will be carried on.“Pope Leo XIV has chosen a name widely associated with the social justice legacy of Pope Leo XIII, who was pontiff at a time of epic upheaval in the world, the time of the industrial revolution, the beginning of Marxism, and widespread immigration,” Cardinal O’Malley said. “The new pope’s rich pastoral experience in Latin America and as leader of an international religious community, and the years spent in Rome, will all provide valuable preparation for his new ministry as pope.”Cardinal O’Malley, 80, was not eligible to vote in the conclave because of his age, 80. He pointed to Pope Leo XIV’s frequent references to peace in his opening words to the world, and noted that they point to the mission of the church to be “a leaven for unity in the human family.”Archbishop Timothy P. Broglio, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, rejoiced “in the international experience of the new Bishop of Rome.”“Certainly, we rejoice that a son of this nation has been chosen by the cardinals, but we recognize that he now belongs to all Catholics and to all people of good will,” he said. “His words advocating peace, unity, and missionary activity already indicate a path forward.”The pope is a graduate of Villanova, where the church bells won’t stop ringing.ImageSt. Thomas of Villanova Church at Villanova University in Pennsylvania on Thursday.Credit...Rachel Wisniewski for The New York TimesOn the campus of Villanova University, students watched the white smoke rise from the Sistine Chapel during a watch party on Thursday, and were stunned when they heard a familiar name.“As soon as we heard ‘Prevost,’ everyone started cheering,” said Isabella Quatela, a senior who is graduating next week, in a phone interview.A former student of the university, Robert Francis Prevost, had just become the new pope.Church bells rang out for hours on campus, and professors toasted with champagne. Congratulatory messages inundated Villanova’s president as the university celebrated its new most famous alumnus.Villanova, home to about 10,000 undergraduate and graduate students in the suburbs of Philadelphia, is the nation’s premier Catholic university of the Augustinian order. The order is based on the teachings of St. Augustine of Hippo, and characterized by its dedication to community. Its ethos is truth, charity and unity.Robert Prevost would go on to one day lead the Augustinian order worldwide — and as of Thursday, the entire Catholic Church as Pope Leo XIV.But in the 1970s, he was just another undergraduate walking the Gothic campus. He studied mathematics and philosophy, graduating with a math degree in 1977.ImageWorshipers at St. Thomas of Villanova Church on Thursday.Credit...Rachel Wisniewski for The New York TimesHe has maintained a long connection to the university, returning to campus on occasion and meeting with students in Rome. He received an honorary doctor of humanities from the university in 2014. He is even a Villanova basketball fan.“He has always been a very loyal Villanova alum,” the university president, the Rev. Peter M. Donohue, said in a phone interview, though he lamented that he may have lost his chance to have the former cardinal as a commencement speaker. “I’m sure he’s going to be really busy now,” he said.Father Donohue was busy himself on Thursday. He happened to be in Chicago, the new pope’s hometown, for a Villanova alumni event. Once the news was announced, scores of congratulatory texts and emails came in, including a note from the president of a rival Catholic university, Notre Dame.He said Pope Leo XIV would bring a humble, simple approach to the papacy, one that he had exemplified as a cardinal. Though Cardinal Prevost lived in Vatican City, he would go over to the Augustinian community most days for prayers and meals, Father Donohue said. “Community was very important to him,” he said.Many people at Villanova on Thursday seemed to have some kind of connection to the new pope. Some of Ms. Quatela’s friends had traveled to Rome and have photos from a dinner with him. “They’re like, ‘I met the pope,’” she said.Anna Moreland, a humanities professor, once had lunch with him at the University of Chicago. She was hosting a department meeting at a restaurant on Thursday when the news broke. They ordered champagne for the table.On Thursday evening, Mass on campus was moved from a smaller chapel to St. Thomas of Villanova Church to accommodate the larger-than-expected crowds. “It’s electrifying,” said Zulena Barcelata, who lives nearby and decided to attend the service when she passed the campus and saw the golden crosses atop the church’s steeples. “The church was full, and people were really singing.”“How cool is it,” she said, “to pray at the pope’s home parish?”Alan Blinder and Christopher Maag, from Villanova, Pa., contributed reporting.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn Chicago, a city where baseball allegiance has no middle ground, one of the first questions people asked was whether the Chicago-born pope cheered for the White Sox or the Cubs.

Reese, a Jesuit priest and veteran Vatican analyst.More conservative Catholics see a different implication. “He takes his name from a pope who stood firmly against the negative culture of moral relativism,” said Ashley McGuire, senior fellow with The Catholic Association.President Joseph R.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on X that his country valued the Holy See’s “consistent position in upholding international law, condemning the Russian Federation’s military aggression against Ukraine, and protecting the rights of innocent civilians,” and that he hoped for continued “moral and spiritual support.”President Isaac Herzog of Israel expressed optimism that Leo’s papacy “be one of building bridges and understanding between all faiths and peoples.”On behalf of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, said his nation appreciated “the Vatican’s role in promoting dialogue and peace among nations and faiths.”Several prominent politicians in the United States also offered congratulations, a group that included Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said he looked forward to deepening the relationship between the United States and the Holy See, and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, a Catholic and the former House speaker, who noted on social media that Leo’s papal name “happily brings to mind Leo XIII’s Rerum novarum which was a blessing for working people.”The House’s current Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries, expressed hope that Leo would continue the work of his predecessor, Pope Francis. “In his final Easter blessing, Pope Francis called on all of us to show compassion to the world’s most vulnerable,” Mr. Jeffries said in a statement. “In this moment of moral urgency, I pray that Pope Leo XIV carries on this legacy.”The election of the first American pope in particular resonated in Chicago, Leo’s birthplace, where the mayor, Brandon Johnson, boasted on social media that “Everything dope, including the Pope, comes from Chicago!”Mr. Johnson added: “We hope to welcome you back home soon.”",
