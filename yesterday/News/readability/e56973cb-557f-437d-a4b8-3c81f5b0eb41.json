  "text": "President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of insufficient gratitude. Zelensky corrected Trump on the year Russia invaded his country and asked Vance, pointedly, whether he had ever visited Ukraine.World leaders argue. What was unusual about the Oval Office flare-up on Friday was that Trump, Vance and Zelensky sparred in public, in a meeting before television cameras that was broadcast and live-streamed before millions.“What was pulled away … was that formal, courtly behavior pattern” of the closely choreographed performances viewers ordinarily see, said Caroline Goyder, who trains politicians and business leaders to speak with authority.The decision not to use an interpreter, the power imbalance among the parties and Zelensky’s “warrior energy” after three years of conflict all contributed to the Washington meeting boiling over, body-language analysts said.Trump is often polite with leaders, but relations with Zelensky, never particularly warm, have been souring. Trump has claimed, falsely, that Zelensky is a dictator and that Ukraine started the war, matching the Kremlin line. Zelensky has said Trump lives in a “web of disinformation.”Goyder likened the exchange to a performance in which Trump and Zelensky were acting out different scenes.Trump, she said, was in a court scene: “He’s in a safe place, his country is separated by oceans, he’s in a place where he can re-center quickly, he’s in a place of stability.” Zelensky, by contrast, was in a battlefield scene, wearing military attire, carrying the weight of the conflict into the room: “He’s got to get things done, he’s dynamic, he’s fast.”There was a moment of levity. When Brian Glenn, chief White House correspondent for Real America’s Voice, asked Zelensky why he chose not to wear a suit, Trump intervened, saying the Ukrainian president was “dressed beautifully.”But later, Trump said Zelensky held “no cards” and accused him of “gambling with World War III.”To Darren Stanton, who studies and comments on body language and behavior, Zelensky appeared “quite angry from the outset” and got “caught up in his own ego.” When Vance is talking, Zelensky moves from leaning forward to leaning back with his arms crossed, showing a “dramatic change in inner emotion.”“He felt he wasn’t getting his points across or wasn’t allowed to,” Stanton said.The meeting contrasted sharply with others Trump has hosted since returning to office. He hosted the leaders of Israel, Japan, Jordan, India, France and Britain in recent weeks.Trump typically deploys “bone-crusher” handshakes, “power pats” and a “chin thrust,” Stanton said, and sits with feet flat on the floor and his fingers steepled to project authority.Visiting leaders have taken pains to flatter Trump, mirroring his body language and echoing his rhetoric on tough negotiations, trade deals and winning. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, asked by Trump on Thursday if Britain could defend itself against Russia, offered a “masking smile.”French President Emmanuel Macron deviated from this norm this week when he placed his hand on Trump’s forearm while correcting his misstatement on money Europe had given to Ukraine.French President Emmanuel Macron contradicted President Donald Trump's claim that Europe loaned money to Ukraine during a meeting in the Oval Office on Feb. 24. (Video: The Washington Post)It was a power move, Stanton said, “The nonverbal equivalent of saying, ‘Shut up, I’m talking.’”Macron is an effective power player in part because he conveys a sense of “inner ease,” Goyder said. “He’s good at maintaining that sense of lightness and ease.”Zelensky also corrected Trump.Vance had said it was time for diplomacy. Zelensky asked what diplomacy was possible with Russian President Vladimir Putin, given his record of breaking agreements. When he noted that Russia invaded, occupied and annexed Crimea in 2014, Trump interrupted to say it was 2015. (Zelensky was correct.) Vance accused him of being “disrespectful” and ungrateful.Some world leaders behave in ways they ordinarily wouldn’t when visiting the United States, Stanton said. “Any red flag that’s different behavior from their baseline we can always attribute to the fact that they’re overwhelmed or intimidated.”Trump’s interactions with Putin, in contrast, show his respect for the Russian leader, Goyder and Stanton said. His body language shows he perceives Putin as a “fellow silverback,” meaning an older man with power, Goyder said. Trump has refrained from deploying his “bone-crusher” handshake on the Russian leader, he said, and they typically “match and mirror” each other’s behavior.Zelensky was interviewed after the meeting Friday on Fox News by chief political anchor Bret Baier. He thanked Trump and the American people but defended his approach in the Oval Office.“I think that we have to be open and very honest, and I’m not sure that we did something bad,” he said. “There are things where we have to understand the position of Ukraine and Ukrainians. I think that is the most important thing because we are partners, we are very close partners.”On Saturday, Zelensky wrote on X that he was “very grateful to the United States for all the support” and again thanked Trump, Congress and the American people.“Our relationship with the American President is more than just two leaders; it’s a historic and solid bond between our peoples,” he wrote. “... American people helped save our people. Humans and human rights come first. We’re truly thankful. We want only strong relations with America, and I really hope we will have them.”correctionA previous version of this article misspelled Caroline Goyder's first name as Carolyn and as Goyden on a subsequent reference.
