Putin of Russia, who has been foot-dragging in cease-fire talks that began in February.On Tuesday, during a televised cabinet meeting in Washington, Mr. Trump again suggested Mr. Putin was not bargaining in good faith. “We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth,” Mr. Trump said. “He’s very nice to us all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.”Iryna Gerashchenko, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament for the opposition European Solidarity Party, wrote on social media that the announcement on Monday was “a signal of political change.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
