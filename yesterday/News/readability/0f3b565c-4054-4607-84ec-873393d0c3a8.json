The clashes have been the deadliest between the two nations in at least a decade.CreditCredit...Heng Sinith/Associated PressSun NarinFrancesca RegaladoPhuriphat Dejsuphong and Sui-Lee WeeSun Narin reported from Oddar Meanchey Province in Cambodia, and Phuriphat Dejsuphong and Sui-Lee Wee from Surin Province in Thailand.July 25, 2025Updated 8:25 p.m. ETThailand’s acting prime minister warned on Friday that clashes with Cambodia over a border dispute “could develop into war” as the deadliest fighting between the two countries in years extended into a second day.More than a dozen civilians and six soldiers have been killed on the Thai side since the fighting started on Thursday. In Cambodia, at least one death has been reported, and hundreds of people have fled their homes in wagons pulled by tractors. More than 131,000 people in Thailand have evacuated, according to the country’s Health Ministry.“The situation has intensified and could develop into war,” Thailand’s acting prime minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, told reporters. “For now, it’s just clashes using heavy weaponry.”Later in the evening, the Thai Army announced that it had killed nearly 100 Cambodian soldiers near a temple that both countries claim. The Cambodian government declined to comment on the announcement, the details of which The New York Times could not verify independently.Thailand on Friday declared martial law effective immediately in eight districts that abut Cambodia. Civilians on both sides of the border ran for shelter as gunshots and artillery fire rang out through the day.“I feel very sad about this,” said Buakam Sangphet, 53, a rice farmer who was sheltering in a bunker in a temple in Surin Province, in Thailand. “It should not have happened to countries that are next to each other. We have been friendly, but now the relationship is shattered.”Cambodia’s prime minister, Hun Manet, accused Thailand of backing down from a planned cease-fire agreement that had been brokered by his Malaysian counterpart, Anwar Ibrahim.In a statement, Mr. Hun Manet said that Mr. Anwar had told him the Thais had agreed to the halt in fighting, which had been planned for midnight on Thursday.Just over an hour later, Thailand said it had reversed its position, according to Mr. Hun Manet. The Thai Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.But on Friday evening, Mr. Anwar told reporters that, “as of now, the leaders of both countries appear ready” to stop the fighting.The United States, China and Malaysia, which is the current chair of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, have offered to facilitate dialogue, but Bangkok is seeking a bilateral solution to the conflict, according to a spokesman from the Thai Foreign Ministry.The Thai military said that it had it killed the Cambodian soldiers near the Preah Vihear temple, the center of previous bloody battles with Cambodia. Maly Socheata, a spokeswoman for Cambodia’s defense ministry, declined to comment.If confirmed, the loss of troops would be a blow to the Cambodian military, which is smaller than its Thai counterpart and not as well equipped. On Thursday, Thailand sent F-16 fighter jets to bomb targets in Cambodia, a rare deployment of the American-made aircraft. It said it was responding to rocket fire from Cambodia.The last time that Cambodia and Thailand fired on each other’s territories was during a three-year border conflict that ended in 2011 and killed people on both sides of the border.The latest clashes erupted with an exchange of fire near Prasat Ta Muen Thom, an ancient temple claimed by both nations. It came after two months of tensions over contested territory that began in late May after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a skirmish.ImagePeople who were evacuated in Thailand lining up for food at a temporary shelter in Surin Province on Friday.Credit...Lillian Suwanrumpha/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMajor allies of Cambodia and Thailand have called for peace. Each nation has accused the other of striking first and expelled the other’s ambassadors, clouding the prospects of a quick diplomatic resolution.The United States, which has a security treaty with Thailand, called for “the immediate cessation of attacks, protection of civilians and peaceful settlement of disputes” in a statement on Thursday by Tammy Bruce, a spokeswoman for the State Department.On Friday, the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, called the conflict “distressing and worrying.” In a meeting with ASEAN’s secretary general in Beijing, Mr. Wang said, “The root cause of this problem is the legacy of Western colonizers.”He was referring to the borders drawn by France when it ruled Cambodia, which have been a source of contention between Thailand and Cambodia for decades.China, the largest trading partner for both Cambodia and Thailand, would continue playing a constructive role in easing the tensions, Mr. Wang said.The United Nations Security Council held a closed-door emergency meeting on Friday afternoon to discuss the violence at the border of Cambodia and Thailand. Thailand requested the meeting and Khalid Khiari, a senior official from U.N.’s political department, briefed the Council.A diplomat on the council said that during the meeting Cambodian and Thai diplomats accused one another’s countries of unprovoked aggression, but they also expressed readiness to commit to finding a peaceful solution. Council members urged both countries to de-escalate and show restraint and settle the dispute through diplomacy, the diplomat said.Kittiphum Sringammuang contributed reporting from Bangkok, Zunaira Saieed from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Farnaz Fassihi from New York.Francesca Regalado is a Times reporter covering breaking news.Sui-Lee Wee is the Southeast Asia bureau chief for The Times, overseeing coverage of 11 countries in the region.Related ContentAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT",
