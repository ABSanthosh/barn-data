  "text": "Here are the latest developments.Rebel fighters breached the strategic Syrian city of Homs on Saturday, according to a war monitoring group and the rebels, whose surprise offensive has swept south toward the capital in a little over a week and threatened to collapse the rule of President Bashar al-Assad.The antigovernment fighters then declared early Sunday that they had fully captured the city, not long after the Syrian defense ministry denied that rebels had entered Homs. The ministry said in a statement that the situation remained “stable and secure.” But the rebels’ offensive has so far swiftly defeated pockets of government defenders in its path. Victory in Homs would set the rebel coalition up for a march on the capital, Damascus, about 100 miles south.The rebels’ quick progress also appeared to reignite antigovernment protests near Damascus. Syrian government forces on Saturday withdrew from suburbs, including Moadamia al-Sham and Daraya, and the nearby Mezzeh military airport, according to war monitoring groups. The Syrian military also denied those assertions.The rebel advances and protests were reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group based in Britain, as well as by the rebels themselves on their Telegram channel.In the capital, people crowded stores to buy food and cars disappeared from the streets, said a woman there who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern about retribution from the government. She said residents felt a mix of fear, worry and, for those opposed to the government, joy. People are waiting anxiously to learn who will run the country in the days ahead, she said.Mr. al-Assad’s control in southern and northeastern Syria also appeared to be crumbling, with a different coalition of rebel factions capturing much of Daraa Province in the south, and United States-backed Kurdish-led forces moving into the city of Deir al-Zour in the northeast, according to the Observatory.Still, Syrian government officials sought to project confidence on Saturday. “There is a very strong military and security cordon on the far outskirts of Damascus and the Damascus countryside,” the interior minister, Mohammad Khaled al-Rahmoun, said in a video posted online. “No one — not them, nor their masters, nor their patrons — can break that defensive line.”How Syria’s civil war reignited: The new uprisings present the gravest challenge in years to Mr. al-Assad. It is unclear what resources he can marshal to defend the rapidly shrinking territory under his control, especially without the help of one of his staunchest allies, Iran, which began to evacuate its military commanders and personnel from Syria on Friday.Who are the rebels: The leader of the Islamist group leading the main rebel coalition said in an interview with The New York Times this week that the fighters aim to depose Mr. al-Assad. His group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, broke ties with Al Qaeda in 2016 but is still designated a terrorist organization by the United States.What Syria’s allies and adversaries are saying: Two Assad allies, Russia and Iran, appeared to be turning to diplomacy to preserve their interests in the country rather than significant military support. Israel, long at odds with the Assad government, reinforced positions in the Golan Heights. President-elect Donald J. Trump said on social media that the United States should not get involved in the conflict.Where protests started in Syria: The rebel offensive appeared to be reinvigorating anti-Assad sentiment among parts of the population. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported that residents of another Damascus suburb, Jaramana, came out in an antigovernment protest, chanting anti-Assad slogans and pulling down a statue of Hafez al-Assad, the current president’s father and predecessor.U.S. national security adviser says Syria has been abandoned by its key allies.ImageAnti-government forces patrolling the Syrian city of Salamiyah on Saturday.Credit...Omar Haj Kadour/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe U.S. national security adviser said Saturday that President Bashir al-Assad of Syria had been largely abandoned by his key allies, leaving his government in a precarious position.Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, said Mr. al-Assad’s brutal and repressive government had left him vulnerable and the people of Syria “fed up.” At the same time, Russia’s war in Ukraine and Iran and Hezbollah’s conflicts with Israel had robbed Mr. al-Assad of the support that had kept him in power.“Assad’s backers — Iran, Russia and Hezbollah — have all been weakened and distracted,” Mr. Sullivan said in remarks at the Reagan National Defense Forum, an annual security conference in Simi Valley, Calif. “And so he has not had the support from those three actors that he expected to be able to count on and has been left basically naked.”Mr. Sullivan said the United States saw preparations by the rebels for an offensive. But the speed of that offensive, other officials have said, caught both the rebels and international intelligence agencies by surprise.The rebels were able to move so quickly, Mr. Sullivan said, because Mr. al-Assad’s backers were weakened by their own conflicts and because Syrian government forces had been hollowed out.ImageWhite House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, seen here last week, said the Biden administration is taking care in how it handles the conflict. Credit...Tom Brenner for The New York TimesPublicly, American government officials had initially reacted with caution because the lead rebel group has been designated as a terrorist organization. In recent days, other U.S. officials have said privately that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, and its leader, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, have evolved, embracing a far more pragmatic approach to governing and abandoning their jihadists roots.Mr. Sullivan said the group remains “a source of concern” and elements of the rebels are affiliated with groups that “have American blood on their hands.”The Biden administration is taking care in how it handles the conflict, with aides to President Biden making clear in recent days that the United States has no intention of intervening to affect the outcome of the war. Mr. Sullivan said that the White House’s main concern was that the fighting not give the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, an opportunity to gain power.Mr. Sullivan said there were reports that ISIS was trying to build up forces in the Syrian dessert. But he said the United States would take direct action, and help Kurdish forces take action, to prevent any resurgence of the Islamic State.The United States, he added, was also taking steps to deter Iranian-backed Shiite militants from taking advantage of the chaotic situation or coming to the aid of Syrian forces.“We are also doing what we believe we need to do to prepare for, deter and protect against any potential attacks from that group of actors,” he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTU.S. warily eyes Syrian war, with spy agencies monitoring chemical weapons storage sites for signs of use.ImageSyrian opposition fighters ride along the streets in the aftermath of their takeover of Hama, Syria, on Friday.Credit...Ghaith Alsayed/Associated PressU.S. intelligence agencies are closely monitoring suspected chemical weapons storage sites in Syria, looking for indications that forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad are preparing to employ them against the collection of rebel groups fighting to depose him, officials said Saturday.The agencies assess that Mr. al-Assad’s forces have maintained limited stockpiles of chemical weapons, including munitions loaded with the nerve agent sarin, and there is growing concern that the government could employ them as part of a last-ditch effort to prevent rebels from seizing the capital, Damascus, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.Mr. al-Assad’s government has repeatedly used chemical weapons, including nerve agents and chlorine gas, against rebels during the 13-year civil war, according to assessments by human rights monitors, the United States and others.Key Arab allies of the United States want to keep Mr. al-Assad in power because they fear that if the collection of rebel groups topples the government in Damascus, the country could become a more dangerous haven for terrorism. While many of those allies have opposed Mr. al-Assad in the past, they see him as a known quantity and better than the rebel-led alternative, a senior Biden administration official said.Aides to President Biden have made clear in recent days that the United States has no intention of intervening to affect the war’s outcome, either in support of the rebels or Mr. al-Assad.That message was echoed on Saturday by President-elect Donald J. Trump, who wrote in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, “Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, \u0026 THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!”U.S. intelligence agencies believe that rebel groups could reach the outskirts of Damascus in the coming days, putting the capital in jeopardy.If that happens, the government could quickly collapse because many of Mr. al-Assad’s forces appear reluctant to fight.When U.S. intelligence agencies last thought that rebels threatened the rule of Mr. al-Assad, in 2015, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia came to his rescue by deploying warplanes to Syria.While U.S. intelligence agencies believe that Mr. Putin wants to keep Mr. al-Assad in power in Damascus, he appears to have less of an ability to do so now because he has committed such a large percentage of his military's resources to the war in Ukraine.It is unclear whether U.S. intelligence agencies will be able to warn Mr. Biden and his top aides in advance if Mr. al-Assad’s forces are planning to launch a major chemical weapons attack.Before a notorious sarin attack in August 2013, the agencies picked up warning signs, including coded messages to a special Syrian unit to bring in the “big ones” and put on gas masks.But the agencies did not translate the intercepts into English right away, so top aides to then-President Barack Obama didn’t know what the Syrian unit was planning until the assault began.Despite subsequent efforts by inspectors from The Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to rid Syria of chemical weapons, U.S. intelligence agencies believe that Mr. Assad retained some stocks of the munitions and that his forces keep them at a limited number of storage sites.The rebels have declared that they have fully captured the city of Homs, about 100 miles north of Syria's capital, Damascus. Not long ago, the Syrian military denied that rebel fighters had entered the city.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group based in Britain, has reported that rebels have taken control of a number of neighborhoods in the strategic city of Homs, about 100 miles north of Damascus.Syria’s defense ministry denied rebel forces had entered Homs, saying in a statement on Telegram that the situation remained “stable and secure.”Rebels have said they are close to declaring Homs captured. After several night operations, \"the remnants of the Syrian regime have fled the city,\" the rebels said in a statement on Telegram. “Now the city’s neighborhoods are being searched and combed in preparation for declaring it completely liberated,” the rebels said.

But the streets were empty. Most people were staying home if they could, scouring the internet for news despite weak connections.Residents are feeling a mix of anxiety, fear and, for those opposed to the government of President Bashar al-Assad, joy, said one woman who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation from the authorities, who have long barred people from speaking to the international media.The sense of uncertainty had loomed larger for days as the rebels bore down on first Aleppo, then Hama, then Homs, dispatching pro-government forces from one area after another. On Saturday the rebels were engaged in fighting around Homs, a strategic city about 100 miles north of the capital, according to war monitoring groups.In Damascus last week, people went to work, classes and cafes as usual. The city seemed to function much as it usually did. But there were small, telling cracks.Prices crept up as some began stockpiling food and gas, though others lacked the means to buy supplies. The value of the currency fell. A few military checkpoints appeared on the capital’s outskirts to catch men who were wanted for their mandatory military service.There was only one topic of conversation: What might happen if the rebels advanced closer to Damascus, as they said they would on Saturday, or even captured it? Would there be negotiations between Mr. al-Assad and the opposition? Would people finally come to know the fates of friends and loved ones who had disappeared into government prisons years ago?Much depended on how much danger and chaos the possible battle could unleash, and, if it came to it, on what kind of rulers were coming next. Though some wanted Mr. al-Assad gone, others, particularly religious minorities, feared the Islamist-led rebels more.Many residents were waiting to see who would run the country, the woman in Damascus said.In the first few days of the rebel offensive, Syrian state media went on reporting ordinary news and updates on the war in Gaza as if nothing unusual were happening at home, a determined silence that only amplified the fear.By Saturday, it was broadcasting about the courageous defense it said government forces were mounting against what it called the “terrorists.” But many residents had already seen and heard too much.Some in Damascus were considering leaving the city. Others wanted to stay in their homes as long as they possibly could.Yasser, 35, a Damascus resident, said he and his parents had packed to leave, just in case. They had first left their home in Eastern Ghouta, near Damascus, in 2012, after the rebels seized the area soon after the start of the civil war. They had been displaced three times before finding a place to rent in Damascus.He said his family could not believe how quickly events had escalated in a matter of days, especially after years of getting by in Damascus under the government’s rule. Now, he said, it felt like everything was collapsing; the family would have to start all over again.Foreign ministers of several Middle Eastern countries met in Doha, Qatar, on Saturday and called for a political solution to the crisis in Syria that would lead to “an end of military operations” based on a U.N. Security Council resolution from 2015. The meeting, attended by the foreign ministers of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Russia, also urged to parties “preserve the unity, sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Syria.” The ministers referred to a stalled United Nations Security Council resolution, Resolution 2254, which passed in 2015 and sought to lay out a road map for Syria’s political transition, starting with a cease-fire. But the fighting has raged on for years afterward, and diplomatic efforts failed to bear fruit.Government forces have pulled out of towns both north and south of Damascus, according to the war monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, including some areas along the city’s southern border. The Syrian military denied that its forces had withdrawn from the suburbs.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn al-Assad’s hour of need, Iran is heading for the exits.ImageRebel fighters near a defaced portrait of President Bashar al-Assad in Daraa, Syria, on Saturday.Credit...Sam Hariri/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesFor decades, Iran has expended much blood and money in support of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, helping him survive a civil war that threatened his dynastic rule. Iran operated military bases, weapons warehouses and missile factories in Syria, which it used as a pipeline for arming its militant allies across the region.Now, just as Mr. al-Assad needs help to repel a rapid advance by rebel forces, Iran is heading for the exits. On Friday, the country started evacuating its military commanders and personnel, as well as some diplomatic staff, according to Iranian and regional officials.It is a remarkable turnabout: Iran not only appears to be abandoning Mr. al-Assad, its closest Arab ally, but also relinquishing everything it had built and fought to preserve for 40 years in Syria, its main foothold in the Arab world.With the rebels expected to advance soon on Damascus, Iran is unable to muster a defense of the Assad government after a damaging year of regional wars that began with the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, an Iranian ally.A collapse of Iran’s partnership with Syria would by all accounts reshape the balance of power in the Middle East. The “axis of resistance” that Iran has formed with its militant allies in Lebanon, the Palestinian territories, Syria, Iraq and Yemen would be weakened. Israel and its Arab allies would be strengthened.“For Iran, Syria has been the backbone of our regional presence,” Hassan Shemshadi, an expert on Iran’s proxy militant groups who was for years a documentary filmmaker on the battlefields of Syria, said in an interview from Tehran. “Everything that Iran sent to the region went through Syria. It is now extremely difficult to keep these channels open.”ImageTrucks carrying diesel fuel from Iran crossing the border from Syria into Lebanon in 2021.

Credit...Bilal Hussein/Associated PressInitially, the Iranian government was shocked at how quickly the rebels in Syria gained ground and the Syrian Army abandoned its bases, according to three Iranian officials, two of them members of the elite Revolutionary Guards, and two prominent Iranian analysts close to the government.By midweek, the mood had turned into full panic, the officials said, as the rebels were on a march that would hand them city after city, from Aleppo to Hama to Deir al-Zour and Daraa.Publicly, Iranian officials vowed to remain fully committed to supporting Mr. al-Assad. But privately, as the rebels gained control over more and more territory where Iran and its proxy militias had reigned, they wondered if events were outpacing their ability to turn the tide, the officials said.By the end of the week, several senior officials had made statements on social media that Mr. al-Assad’s ouster was seemingly inevitable and Iran’s setback monumental.“The potential fall of the Syrian government to Islamist extremists would be one of the most significant events in the history of the Middle East,” Mohammad Ali Abtahi, a former vice president, wrote on X. “Resistance in the region would be left without support. Israel would become the dominant force.”Although Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, who has traveled to Damascus, Baghdad and Doha, Qatar, for consultations on Syria, at first struck a defiant tone, he later said that Mr. al-Assad’s fate would be left to “God’s will.”ImageForeign Minister Abbas Araghchi of Iran arriving in Doha, Qatar, on Saturday.Credit...Karim Jaafar/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAn internal memo from a Revolutionary Guards member that was viewed by The New York Times described the situation in Syria as “unbelievable and strange.” It is as if “Iran accepted the fall of Assad and has lost the will to resist,” the memo says.State television in Shiite-majority Iran switched from calling the Sunni rebels “infidel terrorists” to “armed groups” and reported that they had so far treated Shiite minorities well.Soheil Karimi, a former fighter in Syria turned political pundit, said on a state television news program that Mr. Araghchi’s pledges of support to Syria’s government were nothing but false hope.“The reality in the field is not what he says,” Mr. Karimi said, citing reports from his contacts in Syria. “Our guys are not in the battlefield in Syria now. They have not been allowed.”A video posted on Friday on social media accounts affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards showed a Shiite shrine near Damascus almost empty. A narrator says, “These may be the last images you see of the shrine, everyone has left Syria, all the Iranians have evacuated.” He then breaks into sobs.The shrine, Sayyidah Zaynab, is the tomb of the granddaughter of the Prophet Muhammad, and it has played a central role in Iran’s war narrative in Syria. Iranian soldiers who fought in Syria are commonly referred to as “defenders of the shrine.”ImageSyrians praying at the shrine, Sayyidah Zaynab, in Damascus in 2022.

Credit...Omar Sanadiki/Associated PressThe three Iranian officials said that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the main rebel group advancing in Syria, sent Iran a private diplomatic message this week. The group promised that it would protect Shiite religious sites and Shiite minorities and asked Iran not to fight its forces, according to the officials. Iran, in turn, asked the group to allow safe passage of its troops out of Syria and to protect the Shia shrines, according to two officials.Iran deployed commanders and troops to Syria in 2012 at the start of the anti-government uprising, helping to defeat both the opponents of the Assad regime and the Islamic State terrorist group.It used its continued foothold in Syria to maintain a robust weapons supply chain to Hezbollah in Lebanon and to Palestinians in the West Bank, including through two shipping ports and airports. More recently, Iran partnered with smuggler gangs and some members of Bedouin tribes in Jordan to send arms from Syria to the West Bank.But the dynamics of the Middle East have changed vastly in the past year.Iran suffered significant blows as Israel attacked Iranian assets and bases in Syria, including its embassy compound in Damascus. Israel killed at least two dozen Iranian forces, some of them senior commanders in charge of regional operations, according to Iranian media.In addition, Iran’s key ally Hezbollah was battered after an intense period of fighting with Israel in Lebanon. Russia, another ally of Syria, is focused on its own war with Ukraine. And more crucially, Syria’s Army has demonstrated an unwillingness to fight.Yet another concern for Iran was Israel’s threat to attack any mobilization of Iranian troops in Syria, according to analysts inside and outside the country. Two flights by a private Iranian airline en route to Damascus were turned around this past week after warnings by Israel that it would shoot them down if they entered Syria’s airspace, according to Iranian and Israeli officials. Israel said the flights were transferring weapons.ImageDamaged vehicles at the site of a reported Israeli strike in the al-Mezzeh neighborhood of Damascus, Syria, in October.

Credit...Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“For Iran to enter this fight it would require massive logistical and financial resources,” as well as help from allies and Syria itself, said Mehdi Rahmati, a Syria analyst in Tehran who has advised the government. “None of these conditions exist right now.”“Syria and Lebanon are like our left and right wings,” Mr. Hemati said. “They are being clipped, and it’s hard to imagine one without the other.”Afshon Ostovar, an associate professor of national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in California and an expert on Iran’s military, said Iran was in a bind, particularly with Donald J. Trump returning to the presidency and expected to enforce a policy of “maximum pressure on Iran.”“Losing ground in Syria will make Iran look increasingly weak to its enemies in Tel Aviv and Washington,” Mr. Ostovar said. “If Iran doubles down on Syria, it could be throwing men and materiel into a losing battle. But if Iran falls back, it will appear weak, be admitting defeat, and cede hard-fought territory to its enemies.”The Syrian government replaced the statement by the interior minister with a video of him speaking with reporters. “I want to reassure our compatriots — there is a very strong military and security cordon on the far outskirts of Damascus and the Damascus countryside,” said the minister, Mohammad Khaled al-Rahmoun. “No one — not them, nor their masters, nor their patrons — can break that defensive line, manned by the noble men of our military.”Al-Rahmoun vowed that the government would forcefully push against the opposition forces. “We will break them in Homs and Hama and Aleppo,” he said. “They will be broken and defeated.”The leader of Syria’s rebels told The Times that their aim is to oust al-Assad.ImageAbu Mohammad al-Jolani, left center, last year. In an interview, he said the Syrian rebel offensive was a long time coming.Credit...Omar Haj Kadour/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesSyrian rebels have swept through large parts of Syria in their swift offensive, and the Islamist leader heading the charge says their aim is nothing short of ousting President Bashar al-Assad.After attracting little notice for years, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani and the rebels he leads shocked the world by launching the most significant challenge to Mr. al-Assad’s rule in a decade. He told The New York Times in an interview this week that he was confident the rebels would score more victories against weakened and demoralized government forces.“Our goal is to liberate Syria from this oppressive regime,” he said in an hourlong video interview from an unknown location.Appearing relaxed and confident, but struggling at times with a persistent cough, he was unwavering in his contention that the rebels could end the longtime Syrian leader’s brutal, authoritarian rule. “This operation broke the enemy,” he said of the rebels’ lightning offensive.Mr. al-Jolani, 42, leads Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist group once linked to Al Qaeda, that has controlled most of the northwestern Syrian province of Idlib for years.He and his administration have come under criticism from inside and outside the country for using authoritarian tactics and cracking down on dissent.His rebel alliance struck at a moment of vulnerability for Mr. al-Assad, when the president’s allies were weakened or distracted by other conflicts. But some observers are questioning whether the rebels have the resources and capabilities to hold onto all the territory they have captured in such a short time, or to ultimately govern the fractured country.There are also questions about whether Mr. al-Jolani’s form of rule — where some conservative Muslim strictures have been imposed on the population — would be widely accepted across Syria. He and his group espouse government guided by a conservative and at times hard-line Sunni Islamist ideology.But he has formed an alliance with a variety of other rebel factions, some backed by Turkey, that hold more moderate views.Hayat Tahrir al-Sham was previously affiliated with Al Qaeda, but broke ties with it in 2016. Despite the split and attempts to gain international legitimacy, the group is still designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTRussia, Turkey and Iran called for “dialogue between the government and the legal opposition,” Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia said after meeting with his Turkish and Iranian counterparts in Qatar on Saturday. But he indicated those talks should not include the Islamist group leading the rebel offensive, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. “It is unacceptable to allow a terrorist group to take control of territories,” he said, according to the Russian state news agency Tass.Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the leader of the Islamist group that has spearheaded the rebel offensive, said in a message on Telegram to his fighters, \"we are now on the doorstep of Homs and Damascus, and the toppling of the criminal regime is near.\"Al-Jolani also pledged that any Syrian soldiers who turned themselves over to the rebels or stayed home without joining the battles would be safe. His group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, broke ties with Al Qaeda in 2016 but is still designated as a terrorist organization by the United States.The Syrian armed forces said on Telegram that its soldiers were continuing to fight and decried what it called “fake news” spread by government opponents. In a televised statement, a Syrian military officer who did not give his name said the army was reinforcing lines across the Damascus countryside and in the southern region, in order to guard against incidents caused by \"terrorists.\" Syrian officials routinely refer to rebels as terrorists.The U.N. special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, told repoters in Doha, Qatar, that the situation in Syria was changing by the minute. “The need for an orderly political transition has never been more urgent, starting with the urgent formation of inclusive and credible transitional arrangements in Syria,\" he said. \"For this we need an urgent, serious process, fundamentally different from what has gone on before.\"ImageCredit...Louai Beshara/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Turkey held a joint meeting in Doha, Qatar, on Saturday to discuss Syria. Iranian state media reported that they reached an agreement to find a diplomatic solution to the fighting in Syria through negotiations with the rebels. The readout of the meeting was the latest sign that Iran and Russia do not plan to offer the Assad government significant military support and are instead pursuing a diplomatic approach.A senior U.N. official said that the U.N. was reducing its footprints in Syria and pulling out nonessential staff members who could work remotely from neighboring countries. U.N. humanitarian work would continue, and has been affected by the fighting but not by transfer of staff, the official said.Despite the rebels' rapid advance, Syria’s interior minister, Mohammad Khaled al-Rahmoun, sought to project confidence about the strength of the capital’s defenses. “There is an extremely strong security cordon on the outskirts of Damascus that no one can break,” he said in a brief statement on social media.The Syrian military said that its forces in the southwestern cities of Daraa and Sweida had “redeployed” to new positions after rebel fighters had “attacked the army’s checkpoints and military points.” New anti-government uprisings have erupted in those two southern cities.ImageCredit...Sam Hariri/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAssad did little to support the military ranks, analysts say.Despite four years of a frozen conflict, analysts say the Assad government has done little to strengthen its military ranks, confident in an ultimate victory over the opposition. Instead, the military ranks remain filled with unwilling and poorly paid conscripts, young men forced into military service.On Wednesday, Mr. al-Assad ordered salaries for his forces increased by 50 percent. But that was not expected to prevent more soldiers from fleeing the front lines.A senior State Department official said Mr. al-Assad needed ground forces and that Iran would be hesitant to provide any.Israel has sent reinforcements to its decades-old armistice lines with Syria in the Golan Heights, fearing the conflict could spill over. On Saturday night, the Israeli military announced that it was working to repel an attack by armed individuals against a United Nations post in Hader, near the Syrian cease-fire line, without providing further details.There was no immediate comment by the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the area.President-elect Donald J. Trump said that the United States should avoid getting involved in the unfolding fight for control of Syria, calling it \"NOT OUR FIGHT\" on social media. He said opposition fighters, who had reached the outskirts of Damascus, were “obviously preparing to make a very big move toward taking out Assad.”Trump suggested Russia, which backs the Syrian government and has bases in Syria, might soon be forced out of the country. “It may actually be the best thing that can happen to them,” he wrote, adding that “there was never much of a benefit in Syria for Russia.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTRussia, an Assad ally, is unlikely to come to his aid.ImageA portrait of Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad in a dumpster in an area of Aleppo province taken over by rebels.Credit...Rami Al Sayed/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThere were few signs that a major ally of the Syrian government, Russia, was coming to its aid, beyond some limited airstrikes.Russia intervened in Syria’s civil war in 2015 and helped keep President Bashar al-Assad in power by bombarding rebel-held areas into submission. But now the Russian military is stretched thin, with much of its air and ground force tied up in Ukraine.Analysts said Russia sees little incentive to intervene more forcefully in Syria given the apparent ineffectiveness of Mr. al-Assad’s own forces.“The Syrians need to be the ones defending Homs,” said Anton Mardasov, a Moscow-based military analyst focusing on the Middle East. “If they are running away, then no one will be fighting in their place.”Government forces and their Russian allies withdrew from more than a dozen positions in the southwestern province of Quneitra near Israel and rebels took over the positions, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Syria’s government battles multiple rebel uprisings.ImageAnti-government fighters celebrating the capture of Hama, Syria, on Friday.Credit...Bakr Al Kassem/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesPresident Bashar al-Assad’s political survival was under threat on Saturday as the Syrian government battled opposition rebellions around the country and the strategic city of Homs was breached by the main rebel coalition, according to the fighters and a war monitor.The rebels then declared early Sunday that they had fully captured the city, not long after the Syrian defense ministry denied that rebels had entered Homs, which is only about 100 miles from the seat of Mr. al-Assad’s power in the capital, Damascus. The ministry said in a statement that the situation remained “stable and secure.”Anti-government protests took place near Damascus on Saturday, and Mr. al-Assad’s forces withdrew from several of its suburbs, according to war monitoring groups.The Syrian military denied that its forces had withdrawn from the suburbs. Yet Mr. al-Assad’s autocratic government, which had until just over a week ago appeared to have a firm grip over much of the country, now seemed to be facing a possible breach of the capital.The new uprisings present the gravest challenge in years to Mr. al-Assad. It is unclear what resources he can marshal to defend the rapidly shrinking territory under his control, especially without the help of one of his staunchest allies, Iran, which began to evacuate its military commanders and personnel from Syria on Friday.Russia, his other important ally through nearly 14 years of civil war, has offered only limited aid.The British-based war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said government forces have pulled out of a number of suburbs of the capital, including Moadamia al-Sham and Daraya, and the nearby Mezzeh military airport. That could not immediately be confirmed.The Observatory also reported that residents of another Damascus suburb, Jaramana, came out in an antigovernment protest, chanting anti-Assad slogans and pulling down a statue of Hafez al-Assad, the current president’s father and predecessor.Syrian state media reported that Mr. al-Assad was still in Damascus.Mr. al-Assad’s control in southern and northeastern Syria, too, appeared to be crumbling, with a different coalition of rebel factions capturing much of Daraa Province in the south, and U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces moving into the city of Deir al-Zour in the northeast, according to the Observatory.The group leading the main offensive said it was preparing to surround the capital, which rebels had attacked early on in the civil war but had not entered since.“Our forces have begun implementing the final phase of encircling the capital Damascus,” a rebel commander, Lt. Col. Hassan Abdulghani, said on Saturday afternoon in a statement posted on the rebels’ Telegram channel. He gave no further details and it was not immediately clear whether any operation on the ground near Damascus was underway.“We have started sending more reinforcements from the north and south to the axes of the capital Damascus to support our ongoing operations there,” he said hours later.Russia and Iran both lent robust military support to Mr. al-Assad over the last decade, proving crucial to his survival through Syria’s civil war.But late on Friday, Iran moved to start evacuating military commanders and other personnel from Syria, according to Iranian and regional officials.There were also few signs that another major ally, Russia, was coming to the Syrian government’s aid, beyond some limited airstrikes. Russia intervened in Syria’s civil war in 2015 and helped keep Mr. al-Assad in power by bombarding rebel-held areas into submission. But now the Russian military is stretched thin, with much of its air and ground force tied up in Ukraine.Analysts said Russia sees little incentive to intervene more forcefully in Syria given the apparent ineffectiveness of Mr. al-Assad’s own forces.“The Syrians need to be the ones defending Homs,” said Anton Mardasov, a Moscow-based military analyst focusing on the Middle East. “If they are running away, then no one will be fighting in their place.”Earlier Saturday, the opposition fighters in Homs faced some of the stiffest resistance they have encountered so far from the government forces there, who are trying to block the rapidly moving rebel advance heading toward Damascus.Syrian government forces were stationed on the outskirts of Homs and were shelling areas newly captured by the rebels, according to the Observatory. There were also clashes between rebels and government forces north of the city, the war monitor said.But by early Sunday morning, the rebels and the Observatory said fighters had breached the city.“Syria is witnessing a historic change,” the rebels said in a statement released on their official Telegram channel. “And the people’s message has become clear: There is no place for injustice, no return to tyranny, and the end is closer than Bashar imagines.”An array of different groups have been taking territory from the government in other parts of the country as well.Government forces and their Russian allies withdrew from more than a dozen positions in the southwestern province of Quneitra near Israel and rebels took over the positions, according to the Observatory.In eastern Syria, government forces in the city of Deir al-Zour have nearly entirely withdrawn from their positions, including from the airport and a military base, according to the Observatory. In their place, Kurdish-led forces backed by the United States have sent military reinforcements and released prisoners from a military prison there, the war monitoring group said.ImageAnti-government fighters outside a municipal building in Hama, Syria, on Friday.Credit...Mohammed Al-Rifai/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesWith Syria’s allies pulling back, the weakness of the national military has come on full display.Despite four years of a frozen conflict, analysts say the Assad government has done little to strengthen its military ranks, confident in an ultimate victory over the opposition. Instead, the military ranks remain filled with unwilling and poorly paid conscripts, young men forced into military service.On Wednesday, Mr. al-Assad ordered salaries for his forces increased by 50 percent. But that was not expected to prevent more soldiers from fleeing the front lines.U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Damascus could soon be under threat. A senior State Department official said Mr. al-Assad needed ground forces and that Iran would be hesitant to provide any.The U.S. Embassy in Damascus on Friday urged U.S. citizens to leave Syria now.“The security situation in Syria continues to be volatile and unpredictable with active clashes between armed groups throughout the country,” an Embassy statement said.The main rebel offensive charging south toward the capital is led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. It has taken major cities and large parts of four provinces since launching a surprise offensive last week out of its base in northwestern Syria.In the southern province of Daraa — where the Syrian uprising against Mr. al-Assad’s authoritarian rule began in 2011 — a separate grouping of local rebel factions has taken control of more than 80 percent of the province after government forces withdrew from checkpoints and military headquarters, according to the Observatory.And in the neighboring province of Sweida, a different array of local opposition groups attacked police and military checkpoints and took control of the main prison.Anton Troianovski contributed reporting.",
