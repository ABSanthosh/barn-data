  "text": "Here’s the latest.President Trump said on Wednesday that the United States and Iran would hold talks “next week,” while also casting doubt on the need to iron out a deal with Tehran about its nuclear program.As the cease-fire deal between Israel and Iran was holding in its second day, Mr. Trump told reporters at a NATO conference that he didn’t “think it was necessary” for the talks to produce an agreement with Iran, presumably to give up its nuclear ambitions. It is unclear what format any new discussions would take. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States was seeking direct talks between the countries.“I don’t care if I have an agreement or not,” Mr. Trump said. “The only thing we’d be asking for is what we were asking for before, about we want no nuclear.”Mr. Trump again argued that the American strikes dealt a devastating blow to Tehran’s ambitions, pushing back forcefully against the findings of a preliminary U.S. intelligence report that said the attacks had only set back Iran’s nuclear program by a matter of months. Mr. Rubio also stepped in with a more detailed case for why he thought the Iranian program had been set back by years.Israel sought to bolster that argument, releasing a statement from its atomic energy commission that said the American strike on the reinforced Iranian nuclear site at Fordo “destroyed the site’s critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility inoperable.”The comments by Mr. Trump and his officials were the latest in an effort to portray the 12-day war — the biggest and deadliest ever between Iran and Israel — as a success. Iranian officials have made similar claims since the cease-fire took effect. On Tuesday, residents of Tehran took to the streets for a victory rally and Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said that Israel had “failed in achieving its sinister goals: the destruction of facilities, the dismantling of nuclear expertise, and the incitement of social unrest.”On Wednesday, both Iran and Israel moved to restore a sense of normalcy after nearly two weeks of Israeli airstrikes, waves of retaliatory Iranian ballistic missiles and direct U.S. military involvement in bombing Iran’s nuclear sites.Here’s what else to know:White House pushback: In offering the most detailed case to date for why the Trump administration contends that Iran’s nuclear effort has been set back for years, not just months, Mr. Rubio centered his argument on a “conversion facility” at Isfahan that was destroyed, robbing Iran of equipment that is key to producing a nuclear weapon. “You can’t do a nuclear weapon without a conversion facility,” Mr. Rubio said.Nuclear divide: Iran’s hardliner-dominated parliament voted to “suspend” cooperation with the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog and bar its inspectors from the country, according to state news media. Though the move was so far no more than symbolic — the legislation would need approval from a higher Iranian authority — it signaled simmering tensions between Iran and the agency, which some Iranian officials accuse of helping Israel justify its attacks.Truce holding: People in Israel and Iran took the first tentative steps to return to normalcy as a cease-fire held for a second day. In Tehran, residents who had fled intense Israeli bombardments began returning home. And in Israel, students went back to school and workers returned to offices after days of restrictions ordered by the military were lifted.President Trump’s post about the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, praised him as a “warrior” and also doubled down on arguments he has been making that there was an imminent threat posed by Iran’s nuclear program and that Israeli and American strikes on nuclear sites there succeeded in eliminating that threat. “The result was something that nobody thought was possible, a complete elimination of potentially one of the biggest and most powerful Nuclear Weapons anywhere in the World.”President Trump called for the dismissal of a long-running corruption case against Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a social media post on Wednesday, saying, “Netanyahu’s trial should be CANCELLED, IMMEDIATELY, or a Pardon given to a Great Hero, who has done so much for the State.” Trump has issued many pardons to those he feels are wrongly accused, and two of his own criminal cases were mooted after he won a second presidential term.ImageCredit...Pool photo by Jack GuezAs cease-fire holds, Iranians and Israelis try to resume normal life.ImageLife in Israel began to return to normal on the second day of the cease-fire with Iran.Credit...Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York TimesIsraeli students headed to schools that had been shuttered by the fighting with Iran, some of them used as bomb shelters. Iran’s internet services, which the authorities had sharply curbed during nearly two weeks of war, were coming back on Wednesday.In both countries, people took the first tentative steps to return to normalcy as a cease-fire held for a second day. Some were still haunted by the terrifying moments of the brief but intense war.Israelis were heading back to their offices after days of absences when the military had ordered nonessential workers to stay home, while residents of Tehran, who had fled intense Israeli bombardments on the Iranian capital, began returning home.In Iran, fears swirled over whether the war would be followed by a harsh government crackdown on critics in an effort to reassert control over the country.“My family and I fear both the war and the cease-fire equally,” said Maryam, 35. The reason, she said: “We know that after a cease-fire, we’ll be left with humiliated, vengeful mullahs seeking retribution.”Maryam, speaking from her Caspian Sea hometown, Bandar Anzali, said it was still crowded there with those who had fled the bombings in Tehran. She and other Iranians who spoke to The New York Times on Wednesday asked to be identified by their first names to avoid drawing the attention of the authorities.ImageA building damaged by an Israeli strike in Tehran.Credit...Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesIsrael and Iran have each declared victory, though doubts hung over their claims.Israel killed a number of Iranian security chiefs and, joined by the United States, inflicted damage on a string of nuclear sites. More than 600 people were killed in the Israeli attacks and thousands wounded, according to the Iranian health ministry.Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, hailed the Israeli offensive as “a great victory in the campaign against the enemy who sought our destruction.” But for Israel and its American allies, questions were already emerging whether the war had dealt a decisive blow to Iran’s ability to produce a nuclear weapon, or only set it back a short time.Asal, a 21-year-old Iranian woman who works in marketing, said some aspects of life were reverting back to prewar rhythms. Traffic clogs the roads as many return to work. But, she said, even the sound of a motorcycle now makes her flinch, reminding her of missiles.“We’re left wondering what happens next to us,” Asal said. The regime, she said, has suffered a blow not only to its nuclear program but to its credibility, and reputation.“Their reckless pride has set us back a century,” she said.ImageSome of those who fled the Israeli bombardment of Tehran began returning home.Credit...Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesIn Jerusalem, Israelis were trickling back to restaurants on Wednesday, and some who had fled their homes were making their way back. Some had left apartments in major cities like Tel Aviv and Haifa — which were hit by frequent Iranian missile barrages — for friends and relatives’ homes.Many in Israel supported the war with Iran, which they viewed as a justifiable pre-emptive attack to prevent an enemy from developing nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, they were still shaken by the nightly missile barrages.Ido Emanuel, 30, who owns a coffee shop on Jerusalem’s normally bustling Azza Street, recalled shepherding customers to bomb shelters after receiving alerts warning of incoming Iranian fire. Those attacks ended on Tuesday, but some of his employees were still anxious about coming to work, waiting to see whether the cease-fire would hold, he said.“People can enter the mind-set of a state of emergency much more easily than they leave it,” Mr. Emanuel said.At least 28 people were killed and more than 1,000 injured during Iranian counterattacks since the Israeli operation began on Jun. 13, according to the Israeli government. Roughly 15,000 people were evacuated from homes damaged or destroyed in the missile barrages, the military said.Though the war with Iran may be over, the protracted conflict in Gaza — which has continued for more than 20 months with no end in sight — still hangs over the country. On Wednesday morning, Israelis awoke to the news that seven Israeli soldiers had been killed in Gaza.“If anyone was in euphoria over the war, and the Israeli victory — if it could be called that — we got a real slap in the face,” said Mr. Emanuel. “There’s no euphoria to be had.”ImageWorkers repairing a damaged business in Beersheba, Israel.Credit...Daniel Berehulak/The New York TimesSome Israelis were picking up the pieces.Eldad Albow said he was still displaced, along with his wife and daughters, after an Iranian missile damaged his apartment in the central city of Bat Yam.Mr. Albow said neither of his children went to their school on Wednesday; it was damaged during the war. The authorities have put the family up in a hotel for the next few weeks while they look for new housing.“We aren’t yet in that situation of freedom that everyone else is already back to,” he said.Vivian Yee contributed reporting from Berlin.Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, joined efforts by the Trump administration to push back on any doubt about the effectiveness of U.S. airstrikes in Iran, writing on social media that “new intelligence confirms what @POTUS has stated numerous times: Iran’s nuclear facilities have been destroyed.” Gabbard’s post came after President Trump and other U.S. officials made the same case, rejecting the preliminary assessment in a U.S. intelligence report that concluded that the strikes had set back Iran’s nuclear program only by months, not years. Gabbard also criticized the leak of the report to the news media, and suggested it had been done to “undermine” the president and those who undertook the mission.ImageCredit...Eric Lee for The New York TimesIsrael’s strike on the Evin prison in Tehran killed the prison’s top prosecutor, Ali Ghanaatkar, according to an announcement of his death in Iranian media. Ghanaatkar interrogated and was in charge of the cases against dissidents like the Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi, dual nationals like the British-Iranian charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliff and political prisoners jailed in the notorious prison. Iranian rights group considered Ghanaatkar one of the main human rights violators in Iran’s government.ImageCredit...Mostafa Roudaki/Mizan News Agency, via Associated PressIran’s health ministry said on Wednesday that Israeli attacks had killed 627 people and injured 4,870 others since the start of the war, largely in Tehran and Kermanshah, in western Iran. A spokesman for the ministry, Hossein Kermanpour, said 86 percent of the victims had died at the scene of Israeli strikes.Trump says the U.S. will meet with Iran but downplays the need for a nuclear agreement.ImagePresident Trump in The Hague on Wednesday.Credit...Haiyun Jiang/The New York TimesThe United States and Iran plan to hold talks next week, President Trump said Wednesday, just days after the United States bombed three of Iran’s key nuclear facilities and Israel and Iran agreed to a cease-fire.It is unclear what form the discussions will take, who will participate and what the exact scope will be. Mr. Trump did not provide any additional details, and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.But Mr. Trump seemed to downplay the importance of a diplomatic agreement with Tehran over its nuclear program, expressing complete confidence that Iran will not pursue a nuclear weapon after the U.S. attacks.“We may sign an agreement,” he said at a news conference at the conclusion of the NATO summit. “I don’t know. To me, I don’t think it’s that necessary. I mean they had a war they fought. Now they’re going back to their world. I don’t care if I have an agreement or not.”Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States was seeking direct talks between the countries.“We’d love to have peaceful relations with any country in the world, and so obviously that will depend on Iran’s willingness not just to engage in peace, but to negotiate directly with the United States, not through some third-country or fourth-country process,” Mr. Rubio said.Before the United States attacked Iran, the two countries were engaged in diplomatic efforts over limiting Iran’s nuclear program after Mr. Trump withdrew from a previous agreement that had been negotiated during the Obama administration.Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy, and Oman, which acted as a mediator in the talks that began in April, had been working with Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s foreign minister, as part of those negotiations. Iran had rejected an American proposal, which would have seen Tehran join a consortium with the United States and Arab nations to produce nuclear fuel for power plants. But under that proposal, Iran would be barred from doing any production inside its territory.On Wednesday, administration officials repeatedly made the case that the American strikes had crippled Iran’s nuclear program, disputing the conclusions of a preliminary U.S. defense intelligence assessment.Mr. Trump suggested that the U.S. strikes brought about the end of the conflict between Iran and Israel, comparing it to the Americans’ dropping two atomic bombs on Japan at the end of World War II.“I don’t want to use an example of Hiroshima,” he said. “I don’t want to use an example of Nagasaki. But that was essentially the same thing. That ended that war. This ended the war. If we didn’t take that out, they would have been, they’d be fighting right now.”Johnatan ReissReporting from Tel AvivLt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, the chief of staff of the Israeli military, said the damage caused to Iran’s nuclear program in 12 days of war was “not localized, but systemic.” In a video statement on Wednesday, Zamir said that Israel has determined that “Iran’s nuclear project suffered a severe, extensive, and deep blow, and was set back by years.” He also said Israel’s operations in Iran included those of “commando forces on the ground, who operated covertly deep inside enemy territory to secure operational freedom.”Tensions are growing between Iran and the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog.ImageThe International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. The group may not be allowed back into Iran.Credit...Christian Bruna/Getty ImagesThe United Nations’ nuclear watchdog was regularly inspecting Iranian nuclear sites until Israel began its bombing campaign on June 13. The war that followed shut out the agency’s inspectors .Now the watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, is trying to get back in — just when Iran may be moving to kick it out entirely.Amid simmering tensions with the agency, which some Iranian officials accuse of helping Israel justify its attacks, Iran’s parliament, dominated by hard-liners, voted on Wednesday to “suspend” cooperation with the agency and bar its inspectors from the country, according to state news media. Though the move was so far no more than symbolic — the legislation would need approval from a higher Iranian authority before taking effect — its passage is another show of defiance from Iran.It may, perhaps, be a signal that Iran will renew its nuclear ambitions despite the U.S. and Israeli strikes on its facilities. The vote could also simply be a tactic to gain leverage in any new negotiations with the Trump administration over its nuclear program.One of the I.A.E.A.’s main purposes is to monitor nuclear activity in Iran and other countries, including all those who have signed on to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The goal is to keep them from building nuclear weapons. Iran is a party to the treaty, while Israel is not. The I.A.E.A. still has some oversight in Israel, which has not confirmed or denied having nuclear weapons, but is widely believed to have them.Under its agreement with Iran, the I.A.E.A. is supposed to inspect the nuclear facilities Iran has publicly declared, including those at Natanz and Fordo that the United States bombed over the weekend. Israeli officials say there may be other, secret nuclear sites that Iran has not told the watchdog about.Rafael Grossi, the director general of the I.A.E.A., told reporters in Vienna on Wednesday morning that he had requested that Iran allow his inspectors back into the sites, but he did not respond to the Iranian parliament’s vote. The watchdog’s inspectors stayed in Iran throughout the war and were ready to return to the sites to verify how much nuclear material Iran had left. The inspectors last checked on the sites a few days before Israeli airstrikes began, the agency said on Tuesday.But the I.A.E.A.’s relationship with Iran appears to be at a low point. Only a day before Israel began its attack, the agency formally declared that Iran was not complying with its nuclear nonproliferation obligations. It said Iran consistently failed to provide information about undeclared nuclear material and activities at multiple locations.Iranian officials repeatedly criticized Mr. Grossi during the war, saying that his comments that there was no evidence of a systematic Iranian effort to build nuclear weapons came too late to prevent Israel from seizing on the I.A.E.A. report as it began its attacks.The watchdog’s access to Iran was at its best after the 2015 deal between Iran and the United States and other Western powers that restricted Iran’s nuclear enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief. As part of the agreement, the agency gained oversight over new parts of Iran’s nuclear program. It was also given the power to carry out snap inspections, visiting sites on short notice, including places that Iran had not said were nuclear facilities.But Iran gradually rolled back that extra access after President Trump unilaterally pulled out of the nuclear deal in 2018 during his first term, and reimposed heavy sanctions. That prompted Iran not only to restrict I.A.E.A. monitoring of its nuclear activities but also to start enriching uranium past the limits set by the agreement.The watchdog said in a report in late May that Iran was still cooperating with it and that it was able to mount a “large verification effort,” though it outlined several ways in which it said that cooperation was “less than satisfactory.”The I.A.E.A. noted in the report that Iran has repeatedly said that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the agency said that it could not confirm that assertion unless Iran gave it more information and allowed it to monitor more of its activities.Leily Nikounazar contributed reporting.David Barnea, the head of Israel’s foreign intelligence service, the Mossad, said in a rare video statement that while the Israeli aims in the war with Iran had seemed “almost inconceivable,” Israel was was now “a stronger, safer country that was ready for the future.” Barnea also thanked the Central Intelligence Agency, calling it the Mossad’s “central partner,” without going into detail about the agencies’ cooperation during the war.Ali Shadmani, an Iranian general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps targeted by Israel on June 17, has died of his wounds, according to the semiofficial Fars news agency. Shadmani had replaced Gholam Ali Rashid, another Iranian general killed in Israel’s opening attacks on Iran on June 13. The Israeli military said last week that it had successfully killed Shadmani, but no Iranian media outlets had confirmed his death until Wednesday.ISNA, an Iranian state news agency, is also reporting President Trump’s comments about the United States holding talks with Iran “next week.”The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the details of the talks with Iran. But earlier, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, “President Trump has shown a willingness to meet and talk to anybody in the world who’s interested in peace. I don’t know of any president that’s been as willing as he has to meet with anyone and talk about peace.“We’d love to have peaceful relations with any country in the world, and so obviously that will depend on Iran’s willingness not just to engage in peace, but to negotiate directly with the United States, not through some third country or fourth country process.”Trump says the United States has plans to meet with Iran next week. It is unclear what form those talks would take, or whether they would be direct or indirect negotiations.Like his defense secretary, President Trump is clearly frustrated by the repeated questions about the preliminary intelligence report. When asked about his message to the U.S. intelligence community, Trump said, “Wait until you know the answer.”Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is continuing his near-constant amplification of President Trump today, and he takes on the news media for covering the report by the D.I.A. The agency falls under his purview as defense secretary. “All the evidence of what was bombed is buried under a mountain,” Hegseth said during his turn at the microphone. “Iran’s nuclear program is obliterated.”ImageCredit...Haiyun Jiang/The New York TimesTrump told reporters at a news conference at NATO that he didn’t “think it was necessary” to sign some kind of agreement with Iran, presumably to get the country to commit to give up its nuclear ambitions. “We may sign an agreement, I don’t know.”Trump tells reporters at the NATO summit in the Hague that he is confident the conflict between Israel and Iran is over because they are “both tired, exhausted.”“They have fought a hell of a war, very hard,” Trump said. “I think the war ended, actually, when we hit the various nuclear sites with planes.”ImageCredit...Haiyun Jiang/The New York TimesTrump, at the NATO summit, just mused about changing the name of the Defense Department to the War Department. He called Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth the “Secretary of War” and recalled that the Defense Department used to be the War Department before, he said, political correctness changed it.“All of the nuclear stuff is down there” in the tunnels of nuclear facilities, Trump said, seeming to reject to the argument that nuclear material was moved out of the target sites, especially Isfahan, before the U.S. struck the facilities with so-called bunker-busting bombs over the weekend.ImageCredit...Haiyun Jiang/The New York TimesPresident Trump, speaking again at a NATO summit in the Netherlands, assailed the preliminary intelligence report that concluded that the military action had set Iran’s nuclear program back only by a number of months. He blamed the news media for calling into question the effectiveness of the strikes, even though the report was put together by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency.The Israel Atomic Energy Commission said in a statement that the American strike on the reinforced Iranian nuclear site at Fordo “destroyed the site’s critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility inoperable.” Unusually, the White House put out the statement first, and it was only later confirmed by the Israeli prime minister’s office, which oversees the country’s nuclear commission.The remarks come amid a growing debate over the effectiveness of the U.S. attacks on the Iranian nuclear program. President Trump has asserted that the sites were “obliterated.” But a preliminary and classified U.S. report found that the attacks set back the country’s nuclear program by only a few months.In the statement, the Israeli nuclear commission was quoted as saying that the American attack, “combined with Israeli strikes on other elements of Iran’s military nuclear program, has set back Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons by many years.” It added that would remain the case so long as Iran did not gain access to nuclear material.Rubio fleshes out Trump’s case that Iran’s nuclear capacity was eliminated.ImageSecretary of State Marco Rubio said the Iranian nuclear program was set back years.Credit...Haiyun Jiang/The New York TimesPresident Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio made their most detailed case yet on Wednesday at a NATO summit in the Netherlands for why they believe the American attack on Iran dealt a fatal blow to its nuclear ambitions, pushing back on the findings of a U.S. intelligence report and more cautious statements from international nuclear inspectors.While Mr. Trump largely repeated his assertions that Iran’s nuclear facilities were “obliterated,” Mr. Rubio stepped in with the first description of why he thought the attack had set back the Iranians’ progress for years rather than by only a few months, as a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency report said. His argument centered on evidence that a “conversion facility” — which is key to converting nuclear fuel from a gas into the form needed to produce a nuclear weapon — has been destroyed.The question of whether Iran could recover from the strike on Sunday morning dominated the meeting of the 32 NATO nations. It overshadowed a major accomplishment for Mr. Trump: an agreement among most of the allies, with the notable exception of Spain, to spend 5 percent of their gross domestic product on defense within a decade as they face down Russian military aggression. Mr. Trump had demanded the increase and celebrated the moment, telling reporters during an hourlong news conference, “I began pushing for additional commitments in 2017.”But his anger over the disclosure of the intelligence report on the effects of the strike against Iran was palpable. Mr. Trump accused news organizations that questioned how much damage had been done to Iran’s program of betraying “these brave patriots, these incredible fliers” who streaked halfway across the globe from Missouri to bomb the prime target, an enrichment plant called Fordo buried deep in a mountain. He and other administration officials repeatedly argued that because the attack had been executed so flawlessly, it was offensive to even question the results.Mr. Trump also announced on Wednesday the United States and Iran would hold talks next week, though he provided no details about the participants or the purpose of the engagement. Diplomats from both countries had met repeatedly in recent months to try to negotiate over the future of Iran’s nuclear program, but Iran canceled a round after Israel launched strikes against it on June 13, and the two sides have not met since.Iran is also threatening to stop cooperating with international inspectors, which would limit visibility into the damage done.Yet, the president also downplayed the importance of a diplomatic agreement with Tehran over its nuclear program, expressing confidence that Iran would not pursue a nuclear weapon after the U.S. attacks.“We may sign an agreement,” he said. “I don’t know. To me, I don’t think it’s that necessary. I mean, they had a war they fought. Now they’re going back to their world. I don’t care if I have an agreement or not.”Iranian officials had indicated a day earlier that they were willing to re-engage in diplomacy.But by the end of his trip to the Netherlands, Mr. Trump seemed as focused on proving he has “obliterated” Iran’s sites as he once was on proving he had the largest inauguration crowd. As part of his effort to counter the preliminary intelligence report from the Pentagon, Mr. Trump, during his news conference, read part of a statement from the Israel Atomic Energy Commission.“The devastating U.S. strike on Fordo destroyed the site’s critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility totally inoperable,” the president said. The statement, which the White House had distributed earlier, did not contain the word “totally,” but Mr. Trump inserted it.ImageA satellite image of the Fordo enrichment facility in Iran on Tuesday.Credit...Maxar TechnologiesAdministration officials also denied that Iran had moved its stockpile of 880 pounds of near-bomb-grade fuel from storage areas in the ancient city of Isfahan and at other plants in Iran. Some American intelligence officials say they believe it was moved, and Rafael Mariano Grossi, the secretary general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, part of the United Nations, said Iranian officials had told him the stockpile was going to be moved to avoid threats from Mr. Trump. On Wednesday, he said he did not know its whereabouts.Moving the stockpile could have left Iran with a hidden supply that it could, with further enrichment, use for weapons.Mr. Trump said he did know where the supply was. “We think we hit them so hard and so fast they didn’t get to move,” he told reporters, without citing any evidence. “It’s covered with granite, concrete and steel,” he said.Near the end of his news conference, as Mr. Trump appeared to become increasingly fed up with questions about his own administration’s intelligence, he turned the lectern over to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, whose department’s intelligence agency had produced the assessment. After denouncing the news media, Mr. Hegseth did not dispute the accounts of the intelligence report that appeared in The New York Times and CNN, but emphasized that it had been produced with “low confidence.”“So if you want to make an assessment of what happened at Fordo, you better get a big shovel and go really deep because Iran’s nuclear program is obliterated,” he said.The director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, also insisted on Wednesday that the president was correct in saying that Iran’s facilities had been destroyed. She cited “new intelligence” but gave no additional details. Like Mr. Hegseth, she complained about news reports describing the intelligence document.Mr. Rubio was the only one who approached the question with specific reference to facilities that Israel and the United States hit, and which would cripple Iran’s ability to make a bomb even if it had sufficient highly enriched uranium secreted away. His argument centered on evidence that the conversion facility had been destroyed, along with a laboratory to make the fuel into uranium metal to make a warhead.Israel reported hitting the facility and an associated laboratory for turning the fuel to metal, and The Times described the hit at the time. Independent analysts say they believe the plant was severely damaged.“You can’t do a nuclear weapon without a conversion facility,” said Mr. Rubio, who serves simultaneously as interim national security adviser. “We can’t even find where it is, where it used to be on the map,” he added, speaking of the conversion facility. “The whole thing is blackened out. It’s gone. It’s wiped out.”Satellite photographs show extensive destruction, but not until international nuclear inspectors are allowed on the site will it be possible to know what it would take to rebuild, on the site or elsewhere.The intelligence report focused largely on the state of the Fordo plant, which produced the near-bomb-grade fuel that would, ultimately, feed a conversion facility.The United States used powerful “bunker buster” bombs to hit that plant. Officials familiar with the intelligence report said that early findings concluded that the strikes had set back Iran’s nuclear program by months. Officials said the strikes sealed off Fordo’s entrances, but had not led to a collapse, leaving open the possibility that Iran could eventually dig it out.But the reason Iran most likely could still race to a bomb relatively quickly, officials said, is that it most likely retains much of its enriched uranium and most likely has secret nuclear facilities in which to process it further.ImageShowing support for the armed forces in Tehran on Tuesday.Credit...Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesInternational inspectors and nuclear experts agree that the extensive damage to the conversion facility created a key bottleneck in the weapons-making process, and agreed that rebuilding it would most likely take years. But that assumes that Iran did not build another conversion plant in secret, as part of an insurance policy against the destruction of its declared facilities, which are inspected by the International Atomic Energy Agency.The American attacks in Iran were focused on two elements of the nuclear program. The first was the two centers where enrichment was done, Natanz and Fordo. The second set of attacks was focused on facilities that could be used to turn the nuclear material into a weapon. Most of those were centered in Isfahan, including the conversion facility and the lab that produces uranium metal, which can be used in manufacturing a warhead.The U.S. objective appeared to be to take out both parts of the production chain in the hopes of setting the Iranians back as far as possible.In a separate assessment, David Albright and Spencer Faragasso of the nonpartisan Institute for Science and International Security, a nonprofit organization that follows the state of the Iranian program in depth, wrote on Wednesday that “Israel’s and U.S. attacks have effectively destroyed Iran’s centrifuge enrichment program.” They concluded that “it will be a long time before Iran comes anywhere near the capability it had before the attack.”But their report noted that stocks of near-bomb-grade uranium and lesser-enriched materials remained, along with centrifuges that had been manufactured, but not yet installed. The same report noted that the conversion facility had been “severely damaged.”Mr. Trump argued on Wednesday that Iran had essentially given up its nuclear ambitions, saying it is not “even thinking” about nuclear enrichment anymore, though he did not provide any evidence.Mr. Rubio was more careful. “Now anything in the world can be rebuilt,\" he said, “but now we know where it is, and if they try to rebuild it, we’ll have an option there, as well.”Speaking at a cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said that the country had secured “a great victory in the campaign against the enemy who sought our destruction,” referring to Iran. Netanyahu promised that the Israeli government would work speedily to help those harmed by the fighting recoup their losses and rebuild their lives.The Israeli military just said it shot down an incoming drone believed to have been fired from Yemen. The Houthis, a Yemeni militia backed by Iran, have been firing ballistic missiles and drones at Israel for well over a year in support of their Palestinian allies in Gaza.Iran’s Parliament has voted in favor of a bill to suspend cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, according to Press TV, a state-owned news channel. The bill would block nuclear inspectors from entering Iran unless the “security of facilities is guaranteed,” the broadcaster reported, without giving further details.But to take effect, the legislation must be approved by Iran’s Guardian Council, a body partly appointed by the country’s supreme leader that also decides which candidates are allowed to run in elections. The bill could offer Iran another way to defy the United States and Israel, giving it leverage in any potential new negotiations over its nuclear program.

The office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, which issued a statement on behalf of the commission, did not clarify how the commission had reached its conclusion about the enrichment site, the heavily fortified Fordo nuclear facility.The statement, however, provided official Israeli backing to President Trump in the wake of uncertainty about the result of the U.S. strikes on Fordo. The White House shared the same statement with reporters about an hour before the Israeli prime minister’s office, and Mr. Trump read most of the statement aloud at a news conference at a NATO summit in the Netherlands.According to the commission’s statement, “the American strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, combined with Israeli strikes on other elements of Iran’s military nuclear program, has set back Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons by many years.”On Tuesday, The New York Times reported that preliminary Israeli damage assessments had raised questions about the effectiveness of the U.S. strikes on the Fordo site, which is south of Tehran. Israeli defense officials said that they had collected evidence that the underground facilities at Fordo had not been destroyed.The Times also reported that a classified preliminary assessment by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency said that the bombings set back Iran’s nuclear program by less than six months. Officials cautioned that the report was only an initial assessment and that others would follow as more information was collected and as Iran examined the three sites. Iranian state news outlets, which tend to amplify any foreign news developments that appear to support Iranian positions, widely reported on that assessment.On Wednesday morning, however, Israel’s military said that Iran’s nuclear program had been significantly delayed.“The assessment is that we caused significant damage to the nuclear program,” Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, chief spokesman for the Israeli military, said in a video statement, adding, “I can also say that we pushed it back years.”The Israeli military, General Defrin noted, was still investigating the results of its strikes on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.Mr. Netanyahu has insisted that the war sent Iran’s nuclear program “into oblivion.” And President Trump, who on Wednesday pushed back on the classified preliminary U.S. intelligence, has claimed that the American strikes “obliterated” three Iranian nuclear sites: Fordo, and the Natanz and Isfahan facilities.On June 13, Israel launched a wide-scale attack on Iran, targeting the country’s nuclear facilities, nuclear scientists and senior military commanders. Iran retaliated by firing barrages of missiles at Israel.After more than a week of war, the U.S. military joined in and attacked the three Iranian nuclear sites. On Tuesday, Israel and Iran agreed to a cease-fire.Vivian Yee and Michael D.

In other words, inside, it’s all collapsed. Nobody can get in to see it because it’s collapsed.”Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, whose agency conducted the classified preliminary report, also questioned its accuracy, arguing that the U.S. strikes were “flawless.”VideotranscripttranscriptHegseth claimed the heavy bombs used in the mission caused “devastation” at the Fordo nuclear site.Mr President, when you talk to the people who built the bombs, understand what those bombs can do and deliver those bombs. They landed precisely where they were supposed to. So it was a flawless mission — “Flawless.” Right down where we knew they needed to enter. And given the 30,000 pounds of explosives and capability of those munitions, it was devastation underneath Fordo. And the amount of munitions, six per location, any assessment that tells you it was something otherwise is speculating with other motives. And we know that, because when you actually look at the report, by the way, it was a top secret report, it was preliminary, it was low confidence.Hegseth claimed the heavy bombs used in the mission caused “devastation” at the Fordo nuclear site.“Any assessment that tells you something otherwise is speculating with other motives, and we know that because when you actually look at the report — by the way, it was a top secret report — it was preliminary, it was low confidence,” he said at the NATO summit, adding that the Pentagon was working with the F.B.I. to conduct a leak investigation.The report also said that much of Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium was moved before the strikes. Israeli officials and the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, have also suggested the same.But on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he did not believe Iran had time to move materials, including uranium, out of the facilities.“I believe they didn’t have a chance to get anything out because we acted fast,” he said. “If it would have taken two weeks, maybe, but it’s very hard to remove that kind of material, very hard and very dangerous for them to remove it.”Later in the day, the Israeli atomic energy commission said that U.S. strikes had made a key nuclear enrichment site in Iran inoperable, appearing to contradict initial private assessments by Israel that raised questions about the effectiveness of the attacks.The office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, issued a statement on behalf of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission, but did not clarify how the commission had reached its conclusion about the enrichment site, the heavily fortified Fordo nuclear facility.The statement, however, provided official Israeli backing to Mr. Trump in the wake of uncertainty about the result of the U.S. strikes on Fordo. The White House shared the same statement with reporters about an hour before the Israeli prime minister’s office, and Mr. Trump read most of the statement aloud at a news conference at a NATO summit in the Netherlands.When pressed on whether the preliminary classified U.S. report was incorrect, President Trump said it was “very inconclusive.”“The intelligence says, ‘We don’t know. It could have been very severe,’” Trump said. “That’s what the intelligence says. So I guess that’s correct, but I think we can take the ‘we don’t know it was very significant.’ It was obliteration.”The Israeli military says seven of its soldiers were killed in Gaza.ImageAn Israeli military vehicle in Gaza last week.Credit...Amir Cohen/ReutersThe Israeli military said on Wednesday that seven of its soldiers were killed by an explosive device in southern Gaza a day earlier.This was the highest death toll in a single incident in Gaza for the Israeli military since a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas collapsed in March, and a reminder of the ongoing conflict in the coastal enclave two weeks after the Israel-Iran war grabbed the world’s attention.Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, the chief spokesman of the Israeli military, said the soldiers, members of a combat engineering battalion, were killed after an explosive device was placed near them in the southern city of Khan Younis on Tuesday afternoon.“This is a difficult and painful morning for all of the people of Israel,” he said.General Defrin described the deaths as part of a “complex” incident that was still being investigated. He added the battalion which the soldiers belonged to has been locating and demolishing tunnels and killing militants.The Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, posted on Telegram that its operatives had targeted Israeli forces in Khan Younis on Tuesday, but it was unclear if it was referring to the seven soldiers who were killed.The war in Gaza began after the deadly attack on Oct. 7, 2023, by Hamas on Israel, in which some 1,200 Israelis were killed and roughly 250 others were taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign has devastated Gaza, and more than 50,000 people have been killed in the enclave, according to the Palestinian health authorities.The deadliest day for the Israeli military since the start of the war was in January 2024, when 24 soldiers were killed, including 20 in a single explosion.While Israel and Hamas have engaged in indirect negotiations for a new cease-fire and release of hostages, they have repeatedly failed to reach an agreement.The talks have stalled over the permanence of a new cease-fire. Hamas has insisted on a total end to the war in Gaza, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has rejected that demand, saying the dismantling of Hamas’s military and governing capabilities must be achieved first.Palestinians in Gaza have struggled to find food, fuel and medicines amid Israeli restrictions on the entry of goods into the territory. Israel blocked aid from entering Gaza for nearly three months earlier this year. But since mid-May, it has allowed some supplies to enter through a new Israeli-backed distribution system as well as trucks hired by the United Nations and other international organizations.The rollout of the new mechanism, which Israeli officials contend enables Palestinians to access food without Hamas benefiting, has been marred by chaos, with scores of Palestinians killed as they approach distribution sites.Fifty hostages abducted during Hamas October 2023 are still believed to be in Gaza. About 20 of them are thought to be living, while the rest are presumed dead, according to the Israeli authorities. The hostages remain in perilous conditions, their families have said, urging their swift and safe return.Both Palestinian civilians and families of hostages in Israel have expressed hope that the cease-fire between Israel and Iran on Tuesday will redirect attention to the negotiations on Gaza.",
