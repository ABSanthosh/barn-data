  "text": "LONDON — Before he was prime minister, Keir Starmer was a familiar face in the north London enclave of Kentish Town — knocking on doors, chatting about his beloved Arsenal Football Club and sipping pints at the Pineapple, a Victorian-era boozer he once called “the best pub in the land.”Now, a year into his premiership, Starmer is striking migrant-crossing deals with France and preparing for a visit by President Donald Trump. But in the London neighborhood that he has represented in Parliament for more than a decade, people are still trying to figure out what Starmer’s leadership stands for — as, it seems, is the country at large.At the Pineapple, nestled in the backstreets of Kentish Town, with its distinctive turquoise facade, busts of pineapples, red-painted ceilings and happily dozing dogs, a simple question — “What is Starmerism?” — left many locals perplexed if not speechless.Their answers were funny, confused, occasionally cutting and, in the end, something that sounded a bit like Starmer himself: beige, cautious, surprisingly hard to pin down.“I hate to be sort of obfuscucious here … but I don’t really know,” said Will Cameron, 38, a music lawyer who was vaping next to a table outside. (A quick check of the dictionary for “obfuscucious”: It’s not a real word. But then again, neither, depending on who you ask, is “Starmerism.”)Cameron offered a sense of what Starmerism is not. “I was born at the Royal Free, which is a free hospital,” he said. “I was educated in schools paid for by the taxpayers. I’m a product of the welfare state. That’s a socialist idea. I don’t know that this Keir Starmer Labour Party is reflective of that.”Locals described Starmer warmly, a “regular bloke.” Several complimented his “lovely” wife. A few said he still pops by the pub, trailed by security.But defining his political project? That’s harder.One man just stared at his pint and nodded his head, though it was difficult to tell if it was the question he was struggling with or the number of pints that preceded it. Another said it was “a thing” and then left to buy a packet of sea salt potato chips.Robert Palmer, 31, a freelance photographer who was meeting friends at the pub before a Fontaines D.C. gig, offered a stab at a definition — albeit a bleak one. Starmerism, he said, is a “tepid, kind of beige offering of a Labour government.”That description landed like a warm pint — mild and uninspired and exactly what some voters ordered after years of overheated Tory rhetoric, numerous scandals and chaotic rule.Stephen Harrington, 43, a sound engineer nursing a pale ale in the pub’s garden, said that a year was not “enough time” to define Starmerism. Political doctrines, he noted, do not just materialize based on ideas but take form over time.But Harrington also acknowledged, affectionately, that Starmer was not exactly a charmer. “From about here upward,” he said, pointing to his nose, “his face doesn’t move. It’s just his mouth. Like Wallace \u0026 Gromit.”Since becoming Labour leader in 2020, Starmer, a barrister who spent much of his career as a human rights lawyer and as a prosecutor, has steered the party to the center.In July 2024, Labour won a landslide victory. The win, buoyed by frustration with 14 years of Conservative rule, was like a pancake: broad but thin. Labour secured 63 percent of the seats in Parliament but only a third of the national vote.Starmer’s honeymoon was brief. His first 12 months have been bumpy, marked by policy U-turns, including climbdowns on winter fuel subsidies for the elderly and cuts to the welfare system that would have raised eligibility requirements for disabled people. His poll ratings have collapsed.“I can’t quite work him out,” said Amelie Lindsay-Behrens, 21, who has a disability and is unsure if she will be affected by the policy changes.Experts had no clearer answers than patrons at the Pineapple.“Abject confusion,” said Jon Tonge, a politics professor at the University of Liverpool, describing Starmer’s approach. “They inherited an economic mess, and every time Starmer has almost been the doctor administering painful medicine, but then he’s taken it out of the patient’s throat.”Tim Bale, a professor at Queen Mary University of London, was blunter: “It’s difficult to think the year could have gone any worse.”“There was a mismatch between the extent of change Labour in opposition promised and what their commitment to fiscal stability has actually allowed them to do,” Bale added. “The electorate is disappointed.”Before moving to Downing Street, Starmer lived around the corner from the Pineapple, which has stacks of board games inside and a charming beer garden out back. It’s both grand and rough around the edges and, quite like Starmerism, a bit hard to pin down. One pubgoer raised his pint toward a nearby street. “Starmer’s house is that way,” he said vaguely.Palmer, the freelance photographer, acknowledged that some of the government’s policies have “aligned with traditional Labour views,” including reducing tax breaks for private schools and introducing an inheritance tax, which some critics say has led to an exodus of the super rich.“Other than those things, I don’t know if it has a real kind of definition,” he said, “like Corbyn did, whether you agreed with him or not.”Jeremy Corbyn, Starmer’s predecessor as Labour leader, had enthusiastic grassroots support for his progressive policies but led Labour to its worst defeat in four decades. Corbyn has since floated the idea of a new left-wing party, a potential headache for Labour, similar to the upstart Reform UK party, which aims to outflank the Conservatives on the right.A recent survey by Electoral Calculus, a political consulting firm, found that many 2024 Labour voters who no longer support the party say it has become “too right wing.”Palmer, like others, said he had not felt much “change” — Starmer’s campaign buzzword — on the economic front. Brexit, he added, had shifted fashion photography work from London to Paris and Milan.Starmer has ruled out rejoining the European Union or single economic market but vowed to build closer relations with its 27 countries. Earlier this year, the Britain secured a trade deal with the E.U.The British economy under Starmer is showing modest signs of growth, but real living standards continue to be squeezed for much of the country.Asked to define Starmerism, Jane Ede, 76, sighed audibly. “Difficult one,” she said. “He’s been on the international stage recently and he hasn’t been at home much. Even after a year, we don’t know what his path is.” She described Starmer as “a regular guy who probably misses not being able to go to the Pineapple and mingle.”Mark Young, 64, tucked into a wooden booth reading a murder mystery, said Starmerism doesn’t appear to be an overarching political philosophy “like Thatcherism or Blairism or indeed Trumpism,” but more “a practical and pragmatic approach to solving problems.”“It takes time to get a clear understanding of the complexity of the issues and then work out how to address them,” Young said, closing his book. “But one of the constraints of modern politics is electorates want immediate answers.”During his first year, Starmer has projected competence on foreign policy. He has aligned with France and Germany on Ukraine and built a working relationship with Trump, who claimed Britain was “protected from tariffs because I like them.”Britain has not, in fact, entirely escaped Trump’s tariffs but has dodged the worst.Back home at the Pineapple, defining Starmer’s political ideology proved elusive for many.“I’ve been struggling with it,” said George Brocklehurst, 30, an academic who was dining on Thai curry with his dad.Brocklehurst said he had expected “a kind of soft left centrism” involving more state investment in industry and nationalization of programs. That, he said, “hasn’t quite come to pass,” though he noted “underreported” wins, including shorter waiting times in the National Health Service. “But I think there’s a general sense of malaise,” he added, poking a pile of rice.His father, Neil, 61, a carpet shop owner, said that Starmer’s biggest problem is “he’s a dreadful communicator.”“If Tony Blair or Margaret Thatcher had done the same thing, people would be giving him a round of applause,” the elder Brocklehurst said. Still, he said, Starmer was “a good man at heart” whose message hasn’t landed yet.“If there is a narrative,” he said, “I don’t understand it.”",
