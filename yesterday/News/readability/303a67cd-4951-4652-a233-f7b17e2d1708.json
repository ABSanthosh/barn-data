  "text": "In competing claims about the extent of U.S. aid sent to Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion, President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered divergent accounts — amid an exchange of barbed remarks.Trump said Wednesday, in a post to Truth Social punctuated with false claims, that the United States had spent $350 billion on Ukraine, and that Zelensky said that half of it was “missing.” That’s not what the United States spent or exactly what Zelensky said. Zelensky told the Associated Press earlier this month that Ukraine had received $75 billion directly — a low figure by the U.S. understanding — and that another $100 billion was “never received.”The two leaders appeared to talk past each other, with Trump and members of his administration skipping over the well-documented understanding of how U.S. aid is counted and where it is spent.The United States has appropriated just over $174 billion in U.S. funds in response to Russia’s war against Ukraine, the Congressional Research Service said in a report issued last month. The federal Ukraine Oversight Interagency Working Group keeps detailed track of the funds. More than $100 billion, some of it humanitarian rather than military support, has directly aided the Ukrainian government, according to an analysis of Congressional Budget Office figures published last year by the Council on Foreign Relations, a Washington think tank.In his remarks, Zelensky went on to say that he knew a large part of U.S. aid came not in direct funds but in the forms of weapons, training, humanitarian programs and in other areas. He said: “I don’t know where all this money is.”Trump appeared to take the comment that as an admission that the money was lost. But while Zelensky said he did not know exactly how it was spent, his understanding appeared to comport with U.S. accounting that shows a large share went to activities carried out to respond to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including within the United States.“It is a question of how aid is channeled. Not all the aid is channeled through the Ukrainian government,” said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser in the defense and security department of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).Tens of billions of dollars of the U.S. funds in question are not earmarked for Ukraine, said Marianna Fakhurdinova, a visiting fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington. Money went toward sending equipment through drawdowns from U.S. stockpiles, enhancing U.S. military capabilities, humanitarian aid funneled through organizations in Europe, including for refugees, global food security, sanctions enforcement, economic aid through the World Bank and more. Part of the money also went toward contracts with U.S. defense manufacturers for Ukraine to buy equipment through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, Cancian said. Some of the money is tied up in contracts that could take years to be completed, he added.Of the $131 billion appropriated for security-related activities, $46.5 billion is for increased U.S. military activity in Europe, according to a special inspector general report to the U.S. Congress published late last year. About the same amount is for the Defense Department to replace weapons and materiel donated to Ukraine.Much of the aid stays in the United States, where it boosts local economies where weapons and munitions are developed and produced. Of $25.7 billion allocated in 2024 to purchase new military equipment, $7 billion went to increase U.S. munitions production capabilities, according to CSIS.Where Zelensky derived the $75 billion figure is unclear, but there are several possible explanations. As of the fall, about $86.7 billion of $183 billion obligated to Ukraine has been disbursed, according to the special inspector general report. The value of announced military equipment for Ukraine amounts to about $73.4 billion, according to an analysis by Cancian.Zelensky’s office and the White House did not respond immediately to requests for comment on how their respective figures were derived.In his Truth Social post, Trump said the United States has spent $200 billion more than Europe on Ukraine. The European Union has committed close to $145 billion to respond to the war in Ukraine, including financial, military, humanitarian and refugee assistance, according to the E.U. delegation to the United States.",
