  "text": "Here are the latest developments.As an anxious Europe sought clarity on President Trump’s approach to Russia and Ukraine, Vice President JD Vance instead used a speech in Munich on Friday to signal support for far-right parties, including Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which Moscow has also backed through misinformation campaigns.Addressing European leaders at the Munich Security Conference, Mr. Vance scolded them for not sufficiently upholding democratic values — an accusation many of them have leveled at the Trump administration — and offered what amounted to White House political backing for Europe’s far right. The vice president later met with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.Mr. Vance urged the Europeans to end their opposition to anti-immigration parties such as the AfD, parts of which have been classified as extremist by German intelligence. He said the effort to marginalize the parties and their ideas amounted to antidemocratic action.Mr. Vance called the parties a legitimate expression of the will of voters angered by high levels of migration over the last decade. His words would appear to play into the hands of Russia, which researchers say is behind a torrent of disinformation that has flooded Germany ahead of a federal election this month.Much of that campaign appears aimed at undermining trust in mainstream parties and bolstering the AfD. Elon Musk, Mr. Trump’s most high-profile adviser, has also supported AfD with posts on X, aligning with Russia’s strategic objective to destabilize Western democracies and support for Ukraine.Mr. Vance did not mention Ukraine in his speech, despite the high tension in Europe over President Trump’s approach to ending the war, and as an explosion at the former nuclear plant at Chernobyl on Friday illustrated the continued dangers of the conflict.Before his speech, Mr. Vance met with European leaders who have expressed worries about Mr. Trump’s confrontational attitude toward trans-Atlantic allies, including his demand that they spend more on defense. Those fears have multiplied since Mr. Trump’s phone call with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia earlier this week, when he demonstrated an apparent willingness to offer concessions that Ukraine considers unacceptable, including giving up some of its territory.To Ukraine’s leader, Mr. Vance stressed the importance of beginning conversations about ending the war, but declined to discuss specifics.“Fundamentally the goal is, as President Trump outlined it, we want the war to come to a close, we want the killing to stop,” Mr. Vance said. “But we want to achieve a durable, lasting peace.”Mr. Zelensky, in turn, expressed thanks for American support but said, “We need real security guarantees.”Here’s what else to know:Chernobyl blast: President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said a Russian drone had struck a building at the Chernobyl plant north of Kyiv that sits over its damaged reactor and prevents radiation leaks, and said it was a sign that the Kremlin was not serious about reaching a peace agreement. The Kremlin denied involvement in the blast. The International Atomic Energy Agency said radiation levels outside remained normal.U.S. and Europe: After European allies and Mr. Zelensky pushed back against Mr. Trump’s outreach to Mr. Putin — insisting that Ukraine be included in any talks to end the war — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Friday that the Russian and Ukrainian leaders would be at the table with Mr. Trump, who would lead negotiations.Ukraine’s NATO bid: Mr. Hegseth reiterated that a return to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders was “unlikely” in any peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia, and that Ukraine joining NATO was not likely to be part of such a deal. Mr. Zelensky, in a town hall discussion with four U.S. senators, said he had never counted on U.S. support for Ukraine entering the alliance, even under previous administrations. “The United States, they never saw us in NATO, they just spoke about it,” he said.In a social media post, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine thanked Vice President JD Vance after their meeting in Munich, and said that U.S. officials would soon visit his country. “We addressed many key issues and look forward to welcoming General Kellogg to Ukraine for further meetings and a deeper assessment of the situation on the ground,” he wrote, referring to President Trump’s envoy for Ukraine and Russia.“We are ready to move as quickly as possible towards a real and guaranteed peace,” Zelensky added.In his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine at the Munich Security Conference, Vice President JD Vance stressed the importance of beginning conversations about ending the war in Ukraine but declined to discuss specifics to preserve negotiators’ options. “Fundamentally the goal is, as President Trump outlined it, we want the war to come to a close, we want the killing to stop,” he said. “But we want to achieve a durable, lasting peace.”Zelensky expressed thanks for American support but said there was much work to be done “to prepare the plan to stop Putin.” “Really we want peace very much,” he added. “But we need real security guarantees.”President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is meeting with Vice President JD Vance in Munich on Friday. Zelensky said Kyiv needs “security guarantees” as President Trump aims to broker talks to end the Ukraine-Russia war.Seated at the table beside Vance was Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, and Keith Kellogg, the retired general who is Trump’s envoy for Ukraine and Russia.ImageCredit...Matthias Schrader/Associated PressSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, pushed back against criticism of Trump’s call with Putin, which effectively ended the Russian leader’s isolation from the West. “All the people who are worried about the phone call, where were you when we needed to stop Putin?” he said at the security conference, pointing to Europe’s failures to stop the Russian leader’s war in Georgia in 2008 and his previous invasion of Ukraine in 2014. “Why didn’t he invade when Trump was president? Because he was afraid of him.”Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, told the audience at the security conference that there was a “bipartisan reservoir of determination” in the Senate behind an effort to stop the war without abandoning Ukraine. “For the Senate, there is a strong majority, supermajority, in favor of supporting Ukraine, seeing this through and making sure that this does not come off as a win for Putin and embolden him further.”Pointing to the tumultuous end of the war in Afghanistan, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, said no peace deal should be discussed without Ukraine. “One of the mistakes in Afghanistan was that the Afghan government was not at the negotiating table when President Trump in his first term negotiated a peace agreement there,” Shaheen, a ranking member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said. Her comments echoed those of NATO’s European members.President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said he welcomed President Trump’s efforts to broker a peace deal with Russia, but he appeared to accept that Ukraine’s membership in the NATO military alliance would not be a part of that deal.“The United States, they never saw us in NATO, they just spoke about it,” he said in a town-hall discussion with U.S. senators.VideotranscripttranscriptUnited States. They never saw us in NATO. They just spoke about it. But they really didn’t want us in NATO. It’s true. I’m not about people — and there are a lot of congressmen. Yes, senators, it’s true who have been always in participation with our NATO will, but really on the level of leader of the country, on the level of president, never I heard it. But during my term, I never heard that we will be in NATO. Never.CreditCredit...MSC STREAM, via ReutersThe German defense minister, Boris Pistorius, is offering a robust and somewhat spontaneous rebuke of Vance’s earlier speech — particularly his suggestion that Europe is akin to an authoritarian regime. “This is not acceptable,” he said, to widespread applause. “This is not the Europe, not the democracy, where I live.”President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine sat down with four U.S. senators from both sides of the aisle at the Munich Security Conference. In the town-hall discussion they reiterated U.S. support for Kyiv, but also touched on what a push for peace might look like, including a potential deal for Ukraine’s mineral resources. Zelensky said countries that supported Ukraine’s war effort would be given priority for investment opportunities, noting that if Russia continued to occupy mineral-rich Ukrainian territory, those minerals would be sold to China and North Korea.“If we sign this minerals agreement, Putin is screwed because Trump will defend the deal,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.Instead of discussing Ukraine, Vance lectures Europeans about shunning extremist parties.VideotranscripttranscriptVance Lectures Europe on Democracy at Security MeetingVice President JD Vance criticized European governments at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, saying that they are failing to uphold democratic values and suppressing forms of free speech.While the Trump administration is very concerned with European security and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine. And we also believe that it’s important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense. The threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia, it’s not China, it’s not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within. Shutting down elections or shutting people out of the political process protects nothing. I’ve heard a lot about what you need to defend yourselves from, and of course, that’s important. But what has seemed a little bit less clear to me, and certainly I think to many of the citizens of Europe, is what exactly it is that you’re defending yourselves for? And I believe deeply that there is no security if you are afraid of the voices, the opinions and the conscience that guide your very own people. Europe faces many challenges. But the crisis this continent faces right now, the crisis, I believe, we all face together, is one of our own making. If you’re running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you.Vice President JD Vance criticized European governments at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, saying that they are failing to uphold democratic values and suppressing forms of free speech.CreditCredit...Leah Millis/ReutersVice President JD Vance urged European leaders on Friday to end the isolation of far-right parties across the continent, an extraordinary embrace of a once-fringe political movement with which the Trump administration shares a common approach on migration, identity and internet speech.The address stunned and silenced hundreds of attendees at the Munich Security Conference, a forum where top-level politicians, diplomats and analysts had gathered expecting to hear President Trump’s plans for ending the war in Ukraine and Europe’s defense against a rising Russian threat.The vice president singled out his German hosts, telling them to drop their objections to working with a party that has often reveled in banned Nazi slogans and has been shunned from government as a result. He did not mention the party, the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, by name, but directly referred to the longstanding agreement by mainstream German politicians to freeze out the group, parts of which have been formally classified as extremist by German intelligence.“There is no room for firewalls,” Mr. Vance said, bringing some gasps in the hall.He punctuated the message by meeting on Friday with Alice Weidel, the AfD’s candidate for chancellor in this month’s election, as well as other German leaders. Altogether, it was an astonishing intervention in the domestic politics of a democratic American ally.The vice president offered what may be a preview under Mr. Trump of a redefinition of a trans-Atlantic relationship built on postwar bonds of stability between allied governments. Mr. Vance aggressively challenged the diplomats in the hall in Munich, telling them that their biggest security threat was not from China or Russia, but “the enemy within” — what he called their suppression of abortion protests and other forms of free speech.He made the claim at a moment when Russia was waging the largest ground war in Europe since 1945 over Ukraine. It signaled the Trump administration’s priorities — expanding the MAGA movement rather than halting President Vladimir V. Putin’s aggression.Mr. Vance’s remarks echoed those of hard-right leaders across Europe and the anti-establishment messages that Russia has pumped onto social media in an effort to destabilize democratic politics in America and Europe.Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, called it “a very brilliant speech.”“I heard his speech, and he talked about freedom of speech,” Mr. Trump said. “And I think it’s true in Europe; it’s losing. They’re losing their wonderful right of freedom of speech. I see it. I mean, I thought he made a very good speech, actually, a very brilliant speech.”Mr. Vance is the second figure in the Trump administration to try to chip away at the efforts to isolate the far right ahead of the German elections next Sunday by attempting to destigmatize the AfD.The billionaire Elon Musk, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, endorsed the AfD late last year in a post on social media. He has publicly interviewed Ms. Weidel. And in an address to party members this month, Mr. Musk said Germany has “too much focus on past guilt.” That was a clear reference to Hitler’s long shadow, which continues to dominate mainstream German politics, including in tight legal restrictions against Nazi language.Mr. Vance’s remarks drew a furious response from German leaders across most party lines. They immediately rejected Mr. Vance’s suggestion that they should drop their firewall against the AfD, pointing to past comments by the party’s members in support of the National Socialists, or Nazis.Boris Pistorius, the German defense minister and a member of the governing Social Democrats, deviated from his planned speech on Friday afternoon to rebuke Mr. Vance.“If I understood him correctly, he is comparing parts of Europe with authoritarian regimes — this is not acceptable,” Mr. Pistorius said, drawing sustained applause. “This is not the Europe, not the democracy, where I live.”Thomas Silberhorn, a member of Germany Parliament for the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of the Christian Democrats, also said: “This is our business. My message to the U.S. administration is: German extremists who explicitly refer to National Socialism — part of the AfD — are clearly anti the U.S. that liberated us from National Socialism.”The AfD and its members have a history of use of Nazi language and antisemitic and racist comments, along with plots to overthrow the federal government. The party has surged to second in the polls with its call to crack down on immigration.ImageDefense Minister Boris Pistorius of Germany addressing the Munich Security Conference on Friday.Credit...Michaela Stache/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMr. Vance did not note that baggage, nor did he mention any extremist elements of anti-immigration political parties. But, without naming any parties specifically, he cast the AfD and its counterparts across Europe as legitimate vessels of voter anger over the millions of refugees who have entered the European Union from the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere over the past decade.Germany has been the most successful major European power at shutting its hard-right party out of power, along with France, where a group of rival parties engaged in strategic voting last summer to deny the hard-right National Rally a parliamentary majority.Other firewalls have fallen around Europe, including in the Netherlands, Hungary and Italy. In Austria, the hard-right Freedom Party has been part of federal coalitions and appeared set to lead its next government, before negotiations with a center-right party collapsed this week.ImageThe billionaire and Trump adviser Elon Musk addressing an Alternative for Germany party campaign rally in Halle, Germany, last month.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesIn his speech, Mr. Vance seemed to lump those restrictions into a long list of what he called European deviations from democratic values and attacks on free speech.Those failures, Mr. Vance said, included efforts to restrict misinformation and other content on social media, and laws against abortion protests that he said unfairly silenced Christians.“If you are running in fear of your own voters,” Mr. Vance said, “there is nothing America can do for you.” European intelligence agencies have raised alarms about what they consider to be a systematic effort by Russia at mass disinformation and propaganda, often by using fake social media accounts to sow division and doubt about democratic systems.Mr. Vance ridiculed and diminished that threat.“It looks more and more like old entrenched interests hiding behind ugly Soviet-era words like misinformation and disinformation, who simply don’t like the idea that somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion, or, God forbid, vote a different way, or, even worse, win an election,” he told a largely stony audience.He also poured scorn on the decision in “remote Romania,” as he called it, to cancel a presidential election because of clear evidence of Russian manipulation of the political campaign.“If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn’t very strong to begin with,” he said.Such statements came as something of a shock for attendees who had hoped to learn more about the administration’s plans for peace negotiations with Russia. Mr. Vance barely mentioned Ukraine.ImageSupporters of the Alternative for Germany party at a campaign launch event in Halle, Germany, last month.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times“While the Trump administration is very concerned with European security and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine, and we also believe that it’s important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense,\" Mr. Vance said.“The threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia, it’s not China, it’s not any other external actor.” He added, “What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States.”Mr. Vance also denounced the mass migration into Germany and other nations in 2015, which included many asylum seekers fleeing wars in Afghanistan and Syria. He tied the migration to terrorist crimes, including a car attack in Munich on Thursday by an Afghan asylum seeker, which injured 30 people.“Over the span of a decade, we saw the horrors wrought by these decisions yesterday in this very city,” he said.Even before Mr. Vance spoke, experts at the security conference were warning European leaders that they could be in for a fast and painful reordering of the continent’s relationship with the United States.Mr. Trump’s push to negotiate directly with Russia’s president over Ukraine — potentially sidelining European leaders — and his transactional approach to trade policy and military spending dominated a breakfast panel discussion hosted by the American Council on Germany and the global accounting firm KPMG.One panelist, Jana Puglierin, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, said that it was possible Mr. Trump would build a new Euro-American alliance between parties that share core values of immigration opposition, unregulated social media speech and “anti-woke” attitudes.The council released new polling this week that suggests that value shift has already resonated in Europe. It found that majorities of Europeans now view America as a “necessary partner” and not an “ally” under Mr. Trump. It also found that Mr. Trump’s return to the White House was most celebrated in Europe among members of several hard-right parties.There is one, perhaps paradoxical, exception. The poll found that members of the AfD were more likely to say Mr. Trump’s election would be bad for Germany than to say it would be good.Emma Bubola contributed reporting from Rome.Vice President JD Vance finishes his speech to the Munich Security Conference without saying a word about Ukraine, which is what most people at this conference wanted to hear about, to help clarify the position, or positions, of various American officials.In the end, Vance only talked about Ukraine in passing. He said Europe had to “step up,’’ but gave no timetables or defined American goals for a negotiated settlement. “There’s no room for firewalls” in elections, Vice President JD Vance says in Munich. There it is. That’s a specific reference to allowing the hard-right AfD into Germany’s government.Of all the pressing challenges facing Europe and the United States, “there is nothing more pressing than migration,” Vice President JD Vance tells an audience at the Munich Security Conference that had been expecting remarks about Ukraine and Russia.The big question in German politics is whether Vance is building toward any sort of endorsement here in the German elections next week — specifically, of the hard-right Alternative for Germany, which is shunned by all other parties in the country.“Shutting people out of the political process protects nothing,” Vance says, in a clear nod to the shunning of the AfD.Vance attacks Romania for having canceled its presidential election because of clear evidence of Russian abuse of social media. “If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn’t very strong to begin with,” he said. “I’d ask my European friends to have some perspective.” Democracies must listen to all their citizens, he said.Video“If you are running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you,’’ he claims, apparently speaking of the banning of some right-wing parties from joining governments.Vance says “it is important” that Europe “step up” while the U.S. focuses on threats in Asia, a code word for Chinese influence and expansionism. VideoVance is describing, broadly and anecdotally, events that he characterizes as assaults on free speech by various European governments — including the arrest of a man in Britain who broke a “buffer zone” law against protesting at abortion clinics.Vance is essentially saying that laws that censor social media posts, or that he says have targeted Christian speech, are a larger danger to Europe than Russia or China. The room appears largely silent, and somewhat perplexed, by this opening.Vance has taken the stage and makes reference to an attack in Munich yesterday in which an asylum seeker from Afghanistan drove a car into a crowd, injuring dozens. The room silences as he starts talking about Ukraine and how Europe must “step up.” But he turns to Europe’s political scene first. VideotranscripttranscriptWe gather at this conference, of course, to discuss security. And, normally, we mean threats to our external security. I see many great military leaders gathered here today. But while the Trump administration is very concerned with European security and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine, and we also believe that it’s important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense, the threat that I worry the most about vis a vis Europe is not Russia, it’s not China, it’s not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.Vance says there are lots of threat in the world. But rather than Russia, he says “the threat I worry most about vis-à-vis Europe is the threat from within – the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values it shares with the United States of America.”He seems to be talking about regulation and restrictions on the far right and abuse of language. Europeans will see this as an odd lecture.Vice President JD Vance starts out by talking about “our shared values.” That’s a good start for an audience anxious about the solidarity of the Western alliance.ImageCredit...Tobias Schwarz/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIn remarks and a brief on-stage interview at the Munich conference before Vance spoke, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, stressed the need for European countries to spend more on their militaries, saying they have for too long outsourced their defense to the United States. She demurred when asked if she supported Trump’s target of increasing military spending to 5 percent of the size of every NATO member’s economy, a number that not even the United States hits right now.Saudi Arabia said it welcomed the possibility that President Donald Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia would hold a meeting in the kingdom, according to a foreign ministry statement. Trump suggested Saudi Arabia could be the venue for his first face-to-face talks with Putin about ending the war in Ukraine in comments to reporters this week. “The Kingdom welcomes the holding of the summit in the Kingdom,” the foreign ministry said, “and affirms its continued efforts to achieve lasting peace between Russia and Ukraine.”There is considerable confusion among American allies at the security conference in Munich, with no great expectation that a speech today by Vice President JD Vance will bring any final sense of clarity. American policy on Ukraine has been articulated differently over the last week by different officials. That Europeans must do more for Ukraine and for their own defense is the clear trend, underlined by President Trump. But if the Europeans see writing on the wall, the writing keeps changing and the wall keeps moving.But there is a growing consensus that Europe should make a strong counteroffer to Trump, especially on support for Ukraine, which should not be abandoned by its allies. “Ukraine has agency and it is resisting aggression,” said Radoslaw Sikorski, the foreign minister of Poland. “It has allies that will support it come what may. So it must be included in any negotiation that concerns it.”To ensure their seat at the negotiating table, NATO’s European allies must come up with their own “concrete plans” for peace in Ukraine, the NATO secretary general, Mark Rutte, told journalists in Munich. Those plans, he said, should be clear on military aid and training for Ukraine and creating an enduring peace agreement between Kyiv and Moscow. The aim should be to get the country to a position of strength to ensure that “Putin will never again try to get a square mile of Ukraine,” Rutte said.Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, is set to push back on the Trump-Vance approach when she addresses the conference soon. In particular, she will criticize Trump’s push to expand taxes on imports to the U.S. “America is and remains our closest partner,” she will say, according to remarks released by her office. “We want to continue cooperating with the United States. We also believe, however, that trade wars and punitive tariffs benefit no one.”ImageCredit...Michaela Stache/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesVice President JD Vance has met with several European officials on the sidelines of the security conference today, including Germany’s (largely ceremonial) president. He and his counterparts have made sure to strike notes of cooperation, pool reports indicate. But there has been lots of talk about European countries needing to increase their military spending and prepare for less support from the United States.Vance is expected to speak in about an hour, and he should probably brace for a chilly reception as he lays out what Trump’s policies might mean for the transatlantic relationship.A Russian drone damages the radiation shield at Chernobyl, Ukraine says.VideoUkraine said that a Russian drone had hit a shelter constructed to prevent radiation leaks at the site’s Reactor No. 4. The Kremlin denied the accusation.CreditCredit...Nader IbrahimRussia’s military used a drone with a high-explosive warhead to hit the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine overnight, damaging the protective shelter that prevents radiation leaks, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Friday.In a post on social media, Mr. Zelensky called the damage “significant” but said that there were no signs of increased radiation at the plant, the site of the worst nuclear accident in history. Denys Shmyhal, the Ukrainian prime minister, said Friday morning that emergency crews had extinguished a fire at the site. A Kremlin spokesman denied that Russia had attacked the plant.The structure that was damaged was designed to seal in vast quantities of radioactive isotopes from the fire and meltdown in 1986 at Chernobyl’s Reactor No. 4, and was intended to last generations.The strike comes as pressure grows on Ukraine and Russia to sit down at the bargaining table three years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion. It also comes as world leaders are gathered in Munich for an annual security conference where the war in Ukraine — and recent statements by President Trump and his team indicating that they want to pursue a quick peace deal — will probably dominate conversations.Many attending the Munich conference will remember the radioactive clouds that spread over parts of Europe after the accident at Chernobyl, which happened when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union. The accident was initially covered up by the Soviet authorities.“Now the atmosphere is such that everyone is very angry about this news here in Munich,” Andriy Yermak, head of the presidential office in Ukraine, posted on social media. “Not ‘concerned,’ as is often the case, but really angry.”Mr. Yermak noted that the whole world had helped the Kremlin rebuild after Chernobyl. “Then the whole world invested in the shelter, and today these Russian idiots have launched a drone at it,” he added.The Kremlin denied that Russia’s military had struck the plant. Its spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said, “The Russian military does not do this.”“Most likely, we are talking about provocation and fraud,” he added.ImageEmergency workers gathered in front of a structure at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant that Ukrainian authorities said was hit by a Russian strike.Credit...Brendan Hoffman for The New York TimesThe structure at Chernobyl that was hit on Friday is a huge arching shelter covering what remains of the crippled reactor. The meltdown spewed radiation into the atmosphere and contaminated an 18-mile zone around the plant that residents were forced to leave.The protective structure, which resembles an aircraft hangar, was completed in 2016. It covers another structure known as the sarcophagus that was built immediately after the disaster.The exploding drone breached the outer shield but did not damage the older, interior containment structure, Leontiy Derkach, a radiological engineer at the site, said in a telephone interview.The explosion sprayed shrapnel into the space between the two structures, damaging both, he said, but did not spread radioactive materials. Emergency crews responded at about 3 a.m., he said, as the fire still burned.The first people to approach the site were workers with radiation meters, to ascertain if radiation was leaking, he said. “We are not kamikazes to immediately go into the danger zone,” he said.Air samples determined no radiation was leaking, Mr. Derkach said. Ukrainian military chemists and radiation specialists are still working at the site to gain a fuller picture of the damage. By around noon, he said, crews had not yet entered the outer containment structure for a closer view.The drone, he said, had hit about 60 yards from where protective plates covered highly radioactive debris from the 1986 accident. Had it hit at that location, he said, the exploding drone could have spread radiation at least inside the outer containment structure.Emergency crews, Mr. Derkach said, were assessing how to repair the hole. “The Russians caused us great damage,” he said. “The whole world built this shelter and the Russians destroyed it in one second.”Greenpeace, the conservation group, issued a statement on the strike on the Chernobyl plant, saying it was “a further escalation of the threat to Ukraine’s nuclear power plants and must be condemned and punished.”Chernobyl was among the first locations targeted in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, as the Russian army captured and occupied the decommissioned plant and used the site as a base for attacks on Kyiv, to the south.Radiation levels rose for several days, most likely from columns of heavy weaponry stirring dust. During the monthlong occupation of the site, Russian soldiers dug trenches in irradiated soil, and electrical power to a cooling pool for nuclear waste was briefly cut, raising alarms.The International Atomic Energy Agency said that its staff members at the site of the former nuclear plant had heard the explosion overnight.The strike on Chernobyl, about two hours north of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and the recent increase in military activity around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in a Russian-occupied zone “underline persistent nuclear safety risks,” said Rafael Grossi, the agency’s director general.Ivan Nechepurenko and Maria Varenikova contributed reporting.Ukrainians fear Trump’s peace push will cede their former homes to Russia.ImageMost of the roughly 46,000 people who once lived in the Ukrainian city of Myrnohrad have left.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesOlena Matvienko knows she doesn’t have much to go home to.The Russians captured her city, Mariupol, shortly after invading Ukraine.

And she is horrified.“If a part of America were taken from them, I would like to see how they would react,” said Ms. Matvienko, one of about 4.6 million Ukrainians who have fled their homes in the occupied territories and Crimea to live elsewhere in Ukraine. “It’s like ripping off a man’s arm or leg and then saying, ‘Let it be as it is.’”ImageUkrainians who fled Russian-occupied areas being transported to a center for displaced people in April.Credit...Mauricio Lima for The New York TimesMr. Trump has promised to bring a quick end to the war, which was set off by Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor three years ago. This week, he and his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, publicly handed Moscow two big trophies before peace negotiations even start, saying that Russia could keep at least some of the Ukrainian territory it has captured and that Ukraine won’t be joining NATO anytime soon.Russia has captured about 20 percent of Ukraine, including Crimea, which it seized in 2014. If the deal outlined by U.S. officials this week goes through, many people who have lost their homes in the war will have little chance, in all likelihood, of returning.Going forward, there would in effect be two Ukraines: The one controlled by Kyiv, and a battered Russian satellite to the east, with many Ukrainian families divided between them.“This chain of Trump’s statements is a chain of humiliation for people like me, people who believed that there was law and justice in the world,” said Anna Murlykina, a 50-year-old journalist who fled to Kyiv from Mariupol in 2022.“When you live in a world that is crumbling under your feet,” she said, “the only thing that helps you survive is to believe in guidelines, in civilized democratic countries that uphold values. When countries like the United States cease to be pillars, there is nothing to hope for.”ImageA destroyed Ukrainian recruiting office in the city of Zaporizhzhia in March. Credit...David Guttenfelder for The New York TimesIn explaining the American position, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said it was “unrealistic” to insist on a return to Ukraine’s old borders. That, he said, “will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.”It is difficult to say how many people remain in the occupied territories. By one estimate, there were some six million people living there as of last June, among them 1.5 million children.Some villages have been bombed so heavily that they now resemble moonscapes. People complain about the lack of sewers, water, electricity and other public services, while schools aim to indoctrinate Ukrainian children with Russian ideology. One woman in Berdiansk, a seaport captured by Russia in 2022, said the city was slowly recovering, though few original residents remained. She said that she had not supported the Russian invasion, and that like others who stayed, she was just trying to live her life.The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she is scared of retaliation, said it angered her that some people in Ukraine called those who stayed traitors. “We did not betray anyone,” she said. “We are living on our own land, in our own homes, and simply trying to survive in the circumstances we found ourselves in.”Liubov, 64, who asked that only her first name be used because she fears the Russians, fled Melitopol in eastern Ukraine in 2022, moving to Zaporizhzhia — which is now near the front lines. She said she was worried about her son, who is fighting for the Ukrainian army.ImageMedics treating Ukrainian soldiers wounded at the front lines at a stabilization point in Donetsk oblast in August.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York Times“It’s naïve, I know, but I was really hoping for Trump,” Liubov said. “Everyone I knew said he was so unpredictable, maybe he was the man who would stop the war.”Now she, like other eastern Ukrainians, wonders what the cost of peace might be for them.“I used to fantasize about how I would return home to Melitopol, cleanse my house of these bastards, because they live there now,” Liubov said. “I’d plant new roses, because no one cares about the garden there, and probably many flowers are gone.”For some families, the split is more than just geographical.One 55-year-old woman, for instance, lives in Dnipro, on the side of Ukraine controlled by Kyiv, while two sons live on the other side of the front line. Her younger son, 20, is trapped in the family home in a village in Donetsk. She said she was not speaking to her older son, who has sided with Russia. He’s not alone. For years, President Vladimir V. Putin has fomented the idea that Ukraine as a country shouldn’t exist, that it belongs with Russia, as it was during the Soviet Union. And in parts of eastern Ukraine, especially near the border, some Ukrainians have supported the idea of joining Russia.Ukraine’s government has long said that its goal is to restore its borders to where they were before Russia captured Crimea, but in recent months, President Volodymyr Zelensky has shifted his public stance. He now says that Ukraine might have to cede land to Russia temporarily in a peace agreement and then try to regain it later through diplomatic means. Recent polls show that more Ukrainians, weary of the grinding war, are willing to trade land for peace than ever before; in November, a Gallup poll said more than half of respondents wanted a quick negotiated end to the war.Under the Biden administration, the United States was Ukraine’s biggest backer. Mr. Trump and his team, however, are skeptical of U.S. involvement in the war.Without the United States in its corner, it is unclear how Ukraine will be able to keep fighting, or what diplomatic avenues are available to wrest territory back from Russia. If U.S. support stops, Europe and other allies might have to dramatically step up military aid. Already, the country is having difficulty recruiting new soldiers. ImageSoldiers in Serebryanka Forest, Ukraine, in February.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesMany Ukrainians in the occupied territories say they are afraid to speak, especially to family members elsewhere in Ukraine, worried that their phones are being monitored. When they do talk, like the 20-year-old man on the Russian side of the frontline and his mother in Dnipro, they opt for uncontroversial topics, like the forest or the weather.Russian civilians have already moved into some occupied areas, lured by cheap mortgages and abandoned properties. Some brokers are actively recruiting Russian buyers for waterfront property in places like Mariupol and Crimea.One woman in Crimea, who spoke anonymously because she feared retribution, said in an interview that she and her neighbors had adapted to Russian institutions. She said she had stayed in Crimea because she wanted to raise her children in her homeland, but there is little hope.Many people are at an emotional low because of all the uncertainty, she said. “I don’t understand what prospects I or my children have,” she said. “It’s incredibly discouraging.”Ms. Matvienko, the woman whose daughter and granddaughter were killed in Mariupol, gained some renown in Ukraine after fleeing that city by going back into Russian-controlled territory to reclaim her 10-year-old grandson, who had been wounded in the strike that killed his mother. Her friends say that people have moved to Mariupol from the Russian republics, and tell her horror stories about life there now.“They can come into any house, throw the owner out and take it,” Ms. Matvienko said. “They can seize your business, your car.” “There is absolute lawlessness,\" she added, “no one to complain to, no one to restore order.”One friend, whom she used to chat with frequently on a social-media channel, has gone silent, she said. No one knows where she is.Oleksandra Mykolyshyn and Dzvinka Pinchuk contributed reporting from Kyiv, and Yurii Shyvala from Lviv, Ukraine.",

And we also believe that it’s important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense. The threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia, it’s not China, it’s not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within. Shutting down elections or shutting people out of the political process protects nothing. I’ve heard a lot about what you need to defend yourselves from, and of course, that’s important. But what has seemed a little bit less clear to me, and certainly I think to many of the citizens of Europe, is what exactly it is that you’re defending yourselves for?
