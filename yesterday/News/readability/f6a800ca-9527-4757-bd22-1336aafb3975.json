  "text": "President Donald Trump on Sunday announced steep tariffs and visa restrictions on Colombia after the South American nation’s president, Gustavo Petro, said his country will not accept deportation flights from the United States unless the Trump administration ensures that repatriated Colombian migrants are treated with the “dignity that a human being deserves.”In multiple posts shared on X on Sunday, Petro said the United States can’t treat Colombian migrants “like criminals.”“I do not authorize the entry of North American planes carrying Colombian migrants into our territory,” Petro said. “The U.S. must establish a protocol of dignified treatment of migrants before we receive them.”On Sunday, Trump retaliated by announcing tariffs of 25 percent immediately, rising to 50 percent in a week, on all Colombian goods coming into the United States after he said two U.S. flights were turned away. He also issued a travel ban and said the United States would immediately revoke the visas of Colombian government officials, their allies and supporters. The State Department on Sunday said in a statement on X that the U.S. Embassy in Bogotá would immediately suspend issuing visas to the United States.The dramatic dispute marked the most significant diplomatic crisis in decades between the United States and one of its most important allies in Latin America. Trump’s tariffs, if enacted, could have devastating consequences on the economy in Colombia; the United States is Colombia’s top trading partner, accounting for 26 percent of its total trade in 2023.“These measures are just the beginning,” Trump threatened in a post on Truth Social. He contended the actions were warranted because Colombia was violating its legal obligations and was harming the national security of the United States. (The White House, in the statement announcing Trump’s sanctions, misspelled Colombia as “Columbia.”)In a long and defiant post on X, Petro said he would match Trump’s tariffs with retaliatory duties on goods from the United States.“Your blockade does not frighten me,” he wrote.The tariffs could deal a crushing blow to the Colombian economy, said Sergio Guzmán, director of the political consultancy Colombia Risk Analysis. It would probably devastate the country’s flower industry — a key export to the United States — just before the crucial Valentine’s Day season, while also escalating prices for American consumers.Coffee prices in the United States could soar, too, given that Colombia is a major exporter of it and that businesses tend to pass along the cost of tariffs to consumers through higher prices.“This could also push Colombia closer to China,” Guzmán said, noting that Colombia has expressed interest in joining BRICS — the economic partnership of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — and China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Amid the diplomatic crisis between Petro and Trump on Sunday, China’s ambassador to Colombia posted on X saying Colombia and China are in the “best moment of our diplomatic relations.”Petro’s refusal to accept the deportation flights could complicate Trump’s promises of mass deportations in the early days of his administration. Other Latin American leaders have also raised questions over the United States’ treatment of deported migrants.Brazil’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs is requesting an explanation from the U.S. government over what it said was “degrading treatment” that deportees were subject to on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement repatriation flight Friday.Only Colombia, however, has said it will not accept deportation flights unless migrant conditions improve. Petro explained on X that he made U.S. “military planes” carrying Colombian migrants turn around.The rapidly escalating controversy between the two presidents appeared to take officials from both countries by surprise. Washington and Bogotá have for years had a bilateral agreement allowing for regular deportation flights that have, until now, gone to Colombia at the rate of at least twice a week without problems.Under the agreement, the United States sends Colombia a manifest 48 hours in advance of the flights with the names of the deportees, and Colombia provides authorization before the planes take off. That happened in this case, according to a Colombian official who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the sensitive issue, and Bogotá agreed to accept the flight.It was unclear whether or when Petro was made aware that, for the first time, the planes being used were U.S. military C-17s, although video of shackled deportees being marched onto military aircraft was widely televised and posted on social media.The Colombian official said more than 200 people were on the two flights to Colombia. The planes were approaching Bogotá early Sunday morning when Petro “decided to deny entry” and, within minutes, posted on X that he had done so, the official said.Shortly thereafter, Trump posted about his retaliatory actions.Regarding claims that deportees have been mistreated, former U.S. officials speaking on the condition of anonymity said that shackles have been traditionally used around the world to prevent deportees from kicking, biting or attacking accompanying security officials.The State Department and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about any orders issued to carry out Trump’s sanctions.Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that the president made it clear that under his administration, “America will no longer be lied to nor taken advantage of.”“It is the responsibility of each nation to take back their citizens who are illegally present in the United States in a serious and expeditious manner,” Rubio said. “As demonstrated by today’s actions, we are unwavering in our commitment to end illegal immigration and bolster America’s border security.”Both presidents have long been known to make frequent use of social media in undiplomatic ways. In response to Trump’s don’t-mess-with-me post, Petro — a member of Colombia’s M-19 guerrilla group in the 1980s who was elected president in 2022 — replied: “If you know somebody stubborn, that’s me.”Laura Sarabia, who was recently named Colombia’s foreign minister, said the government reaffirms its commitment to the “dignified return” of its nationals, guaranteeing “respectful and humane treatment” and adequate conditions. The Petro government is “open to dialogue with the U.S. to verify and strengthen protocols.”Shortly after Trump’s post, the Colombian government issued a statement offering to use the presidential plane to fly in its citizens deported from the United States, although it did not specify how or where it would receive the deportees.The tensions threaten repercussions for both Colombians and U.S. consumers.While Petro has long criticized the United States, including its role in the war on drugs, he walked a careful line with the Biden administration. Despite Colombia’s role as a cornerstone partner for the United States in South America, Trump appears to see Petro as “an irreverent president who he wants to make an example of,” Guzmán of Colombia Risk Analysis said.“He chose the wrong moment to face up Trump,” Guzmán said. “He’s going to drag us into a personal conflict with President Trump, with a significant burden on all of us.”Petro — Colombia’s first leftist president, who is closely allied with the presidents of Brazil and Mexico — said that over 15,600 U.S. citizens are living in Colombia without the proper documents. Petro added that, while he’s aware some Americans are living in Colombia illegally, he’s not going to raid them and return them to the United States in chains.Remittances to Colombia make up an estimated 3.4 percent of the country’s economy — more than coffee, a key Colombian export. Most of those remittances come from the United States.It is one of the top recipients of U.S. foreign assistance since the 2000 launch of Plan Colombia, a counternarcotics and security initiative that has often had bipartisan support in the United States. The United States has sent about $14 billion in funding to Colombia since 2000, at least 60 percent of it for the military and police.The latest actions could harm Colombia more than the United States, said Juan Cruz, who served as a senior official in Trump’s first administration at the White House National Security Council and is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.“I don’t see options for the Colombians: There’s no other way but to back down. If this is President Trump’s initial incursion, he can’t back down because what message does that send to the others?” Cruz said. “President Trump means what he says and is going to move forward on this — the Colombians have to find a way to make this work.”The Colombian American Chamber of Commerce, AmCham Colombia, also warned of devastating consequences to the economy of the tariffs. “In coffee alone, more than 500,000 families depend on this sector. In flower farming, thousands of single mothers would lose their livelihood,” the chamber said.The rising tensions could have repercussions for Colombians and their ability to travel to the United States, especially at a time when the Trump administration has said it will implement travel bans for certain nationalities, said Diego Chaves-González, a senior manager for the Migration Policy Institute’s Latin America and Caribbean Initiative.Chaves-González, a Colombia native, urged the importance of reinforcing diplomatic channels between the two countries. “The most damaging thing would be to continue to manage this situation in an improvised way on social media,” he said.Petro’s refusal to accept these flights comes as Trump and his administration ramp up efforts to detain undocumented immigrants nationwide — efforts that began soon after the president took office Monday.On Friday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted photos showing U.S. troops loading shackled detainees onto a military cargo plane for a flight to Guatemala, saying Trump “is sending a strong and clear message to the entire world: if you illegally enter the United States of America, you will face severe consequences.”Leavitt claimed that on Thursday, Mexico “accepted a record 4 deportation flights in 1 day!” While NBC News reported Friday that Mexico had refused to accept a U.S. military jet carrying deportees a day earlier, the Mexican Foreign Ministry denied it was blocking the returns of its citizens.“Mexico has a good relationship with the government of the United States, and we cooperate with respect for each country’s sovereignty on a wide range of issues, including migration,” it said in a statement. “As far as repatriations go, we always accept the arrival of Mexicans in our land with open arms.”In Brazil, 88 Brazilian nationals were subject to what the country said was undignified treatment on a repatriation flight. The passengers were handcuffed at their hands and feet and the air-conditioning system was broken, among other problems, according to a statement from the Foreign Ministry posted Saturday.The flight, which was bound for Confins International Airport in Belo Horizonte, had to make an emergency landing Friday in Manaus due to technical problems, Brazil’s Ministry of Justice and Public Security said.The minister of justice and public security, Ricardo Lewandowski, slammed “the flagrant disregard for the fundamental rights of Brazilian citizens.”Terrence McCoy, Mary Beth Sheridan, Jeff Stein and Michael Birnbaum contributed to this report.",
