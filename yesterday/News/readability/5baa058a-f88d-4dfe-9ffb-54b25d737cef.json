The value was roughly 5 billion euros, or about $5.7 billion, it said.Mr. Zelensky was visiting Berlin in a bid to secure more assistance from Europe’s industrial powerhouse, and holding his third meeting with Mr. Merz since the German leader took office this month. His trip came as both Moscow and Ukraine race to expand their arsenals to fight a war that is set to drag into a fourth straight summer.The meetings between Mr. Merz and Mr. Zelensky underscores the chancellor’s efforts to reestablish German leadership among European allies in the face of weakening U.S. commitments to NATO, and the importance his country will play in sustaining the Ukrainian war effort.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
