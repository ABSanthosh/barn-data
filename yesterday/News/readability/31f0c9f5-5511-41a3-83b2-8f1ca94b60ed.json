  "text": "Venezuela’s autocratic president, Nicolás Maduro, released a U.S. Air Force veteran who had been imprisoned in Venezuela for about six months, his family confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.Richard Grenell, the Trump administration’s presidential envoy for special missions, facilitated the release and announced the return of the U.S. veteran, Joseph St. Clair, to the United States.“Joe St. Clair is back in America,” Grenell wrote Tuesday evening in a post on X. “I met Venezuelan officials in a neutral country today to negotiate an America First strategy.”St. Clair’s parents, Scott and Patti St. Clair, said in a statement that the news of his release “came suddenly, and we are still processing it — but we are overwhelmed with joy and gratitude.”“We remain in prayer and solidarity with the families of those who are still being held,” the St. Clairs added.St. Clair was one of several Americans imprisoned in Venezuela. The U.S. State Department in March said nine Americans were wrongfully detained in Venezuela.In a separate announcement after landing in Washington, Grenell said that as a result of “progress” made with the Venezuelan government, the Trump administration will grant an extension for Chevron’s oil operations in Venezuela.He did not clarify the details or duration of that extension, but a person with direct knowledge of the move said the extension would grant Chevron an additional 60 days to operate in the country. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the details of the extension.Grenell said during an appearance on Stephen K. Bannon’s “War Room” talk show that President Donald Trump “authorized that extension if we were able to get some progress, if we were able to build some confidence, and we were able to do that today, so that extension will be granted.”The Trump administration in February said it was revoking a Treasury Department license allowing Chevron to produce and export oil from Venezuela, despite U.S. sanctions, because Maduro was not legitimately elected and had not accepted Venezuelans deported from the country fast enough.Chevron was given time to wind down operations, and the Trump administration has granted extensions for that wind-down period.Maduro has in recent weeks accepted regular deportation flights from the United States and shown a willingness to continue dialogue with the Trump administration. Chevron’s operations in Venezuela are a crucial lifeline for the country’s economy. But Grenell’s continued engagement with Venezuela has clashed with the approach of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has long been a Venezuela hawk keen on applying maximum pressure on Maduro.Speaking to Bannon, Grenell said Trump officials “want to make sure that the Chinese are not coming in and taking oil and minerals and gold and keeping us on the outside.” He added that Trump believes that “sanctions penalize American companies.”“We want to put America first and do what’s best for America,” Grenell said. “That means making sure that the Chinese do not take the Venezuelan oil.”Grenell met the Venezuelan officials in Antigua, and from there returned with St. Clair to Washington, he said. He described St. Clair as a “young man who served in the military and found himself in a Venezuelan prison for really no reason at all, held against his will.”St. Clair served four tours in Afghanistan and was honorably discharged in 2019, according to a St. Clair family spokesman, Jonathan Franks.St. Clair was visiting a friend’s relative in Colombia near the Venezuelan border before he was arrested by Venezuelan authorities last year, the spokesman said. The Wall Street Journal first reported St. Clair’s release Tuesday.To the best of the family’s knowledge, he had been held in Rodeo I, a prison where the Maduro government is known to detain many high-profile and political prisoners. Detainees in Rodeo I are often held in prolonged periods of isolation, subjected to “particularly cruel and inhumane conditions,” such as lack of toilet paper and sleeping on concrete beds without mattresses or blankets, according to an open letter from several civil society organizations last year.In late January, Venezuela released six detained Americans after Grenell traveled to Caracas to meet with Maduro.Alex Horton contributed to this report.",
