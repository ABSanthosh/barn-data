White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai told Fox News Digital that he should apologize for calling for people to fight in the streets against Trump. \"While President Trump remains focused on uniting our country and delivering the mandate set by the American people, the House Minority Leader, Hakeem Jeffries, incites violence calling for people to fight ‘in the streets’ against President Trump’s agenda,\" Desai said.\"This unhinged violent rhetoric is dangerous. Leader Jeffries should immediately apologize,\" Desai said. \"Right now, we're going to keep focused on the need to look out for everyday New Yorkers and everyday Americans who are under assault by an extreme MAGA Republican agenda that is trying to cut taxes for billionaires, donors, and wealthy corporations and then stick New Yorkers and working-class Americans across the country with the bill,\" Jeffries said.\"That's not acceptable. We are going to fight it legislatively. We are going to fight it in the courts. We're going to fight it in the streets.\"Jeffries spokesperson Christie Stephenson told Fox News that it is a laughable allegation against Jeffries that he incited violence against Trump. \"The notion that Leader Jeffries supports violence is laughable. Republicans are the party that pardons violent felons who assault police officers. Democrats are the party of John Lewis and the right to petition the government peaceful,\" he said. Jeffries also slammed Donald Trump over the Potomac plane crash in a different statement. \"Bodies are still being pulled from the Potomac. The President and extreme MAGA Republicans are blaming women and people of color for the deadly plane crash. At the same time, they are dismantling the Federal Aviation Administration as we know it. Disgusting,\" Jeffries said.",
