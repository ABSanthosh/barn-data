  "text": "Elon Musk’s growing influence over more than a dozen federal agencies in Trump-led US administration is causing friction with some senior White House staffers, as Reuters reported.Trump himself remains a strong supporter of the tech billionaire and his department of government efficiency (DOGE); however, frustrations have emerged over communication gaps and a lack of coordination, according to multiple sources quoted by Reuters news agency.Trump’s chief of staff, Susie Wiles, and her team have felt left out as Musk and his DOGE staff make major job cuts and reorganise government agencies.Some of Trump’s allies back Musk’s bold approach, but others are uneasy. Musk spent over $250 million to support Trump’s re-election and is now a key figure in his administration.Musk’s team has accessed sensitive data and made sudden changes, leaving some White House officials struggling to keep up.Calls for better coordinationOne source familiar with the situation said Wiles and her staff recently conveyed a message to Musk: “We need to message all this. We need to be looped in.” The exact timing of the conversation is unclear, and it is unknown whether Musk made any changes after their discussion. However, Trump continues to speak highly of Musk in conversations.The White House declined to comment, but an official told Reuters the tensions were just \"operational hiccups\" that had been resolved. The official said Musk sends Wiles daily reports and they talk often by phone.Expanding authorityDespite concerns within the White House, Musk’s influence is only growing. On Tuesday, Trump signed an executive order expanding DOGE’s authority, requiring federal agencies to work with Musk’s team to implement major workforce reductions and restrict new hiring. The order also places a DOGE-appointed “team lead” at every government agency to oversee hiring decisions.At a news conference with Trump, Musk defended his role, saying he was carrying out the people's will. “The people voted for major government reform, and that's what people are going to get,” he told reporters. “All of our actions are maximally transparent.” He was joined by his 4-year-old son, \"Little X.\"Trump has called Musk “fantastic” and praised his DOGE staff as “super geniuses.” However, Musk’s bold, high-profile style contrasts with Wiles’ quiet, disciplined approach.DOGE’s secretive cutsDespite Musk’s claims of transparency, DOGE operates in secrecy. It has not shared details about its staff, agency work, or budget cut plans. Instead, it only gives general cost-saving figures, leaving many federal employees unsure about their future.The lack of coordination has led to frustration among Wiles’ team, particularly regarding Musk’s frequent posts on X. One White House associate said some staffers were “finding things out on Twitter” rather than through official channels.Furthermore, one major issue was a mass email sent to federal employees on January 28, offering two million workers financial incentives to resign. Reuters reported that Wiles and her team had not approved all such messages, raising concerns about Musk acting on his own.",
