Photograph: Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere/AFP/Getty ImagesThe mayor of Mayotte’s capital of Mamoudzou, Ambdilwahedou Soumaila, had earlier told Agence France-Presse that nine people had been seriously injured when Cyclone Chido hit and were fighting for their lives in hospital, while 246 more were badly hurt.“The hospital is hit, the schools are hit. Houses are totally devastated,” he said, adding that the cyclone had “spared nothing”.One local resident, Ibrahim, told AFP of “apocalyptic scenes” as he made his way through the main island, having to clear blocked roads for himself.Map showing Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, between Madagascar and mainland Africa.Mayotte’s 320,000 residents had been ordered into lockdown on Saturday as Chido bore down on the islands, bringing winds of at least 226 kilometres an hour (140mph).Aerial footage shared by French gendarmerie forces showed the wreckage of hundreds of makeshift houses strewn across the hills of one of Mayotte’s islands, which have been a focal point for illegal immigration from nearby Comoros.France’s interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, would travel to Mayotte on Monday, his office said, alongside 160 soldiers and firefighters who will join the 110 personnel already deployed to the islands.A still from a video released by the French gendarmerie. Photograph: APAuthorities in Réunion, another French Indian Ocean territory about 1,400 kilometres away on the other side of Madagascar, said medical personnel and equipment were on the way by air and sea.A first aid plane landed in Mayotte at about 3:30pm local time on Sunday with three tonnes of medical supplies and blood for transfusions and 17 medical staff. Two military aircraft were expected to follow.A navy patrol ship was also to depart Réunion with personnel and equipment, including for the electricity supplier EDF.The prefect of Réunion, Patrice Latron, said authorities aimed to establish an air and sea bridge to Mayotte. About 800 more rescuers were to be sent in the coming days and more than 80 tonnes of supplies had been flown in or were on their way by ship. Priorities included restoring electricity and access to drinking water, he said.Mayotte is France’s poorest island and the EU’s poorest territory. In some parts, entire neighbourhoods of metal shacks and huts were flattened, while residents reported many trees had been uprooted, boats flipped or sunk and the electricity supply knocked out.Chido also battered the nearby islands of Comoros and Madagascar. Authorities in Comoros said 11 fishers who had gone out to sea earlier this week were missing. The intense tropical cyclone, which made landfall in Mozambique on Sunday, could affect 2.5 million people in the north of the country as aid agencies warn of more loss of life and severe damage.A Unicef spokesperson confirmed that Cabo Delgado, Mozambique’s northernmost province, which is home to about 2 million people, had been hit, and that many homes, schools and health facilities there had been partly or completely destroyed.Cyclone season in the region runs from December to March, and parts of the south-eastern Indian Ocean and southern Africa have been hit by a series of strong ones in recent years. Cyclone Idai killed more than 1,300 people in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe in 2019. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries last year.The cyclones bring the risk of flooding and landslides, but also stagnant pools of water that may later cause deadly outbreaks of cholera, dengue fever and malaria.Studies say the cyclones are getting worse because of the climate emergency. They can cause large humanitarian crises in poor countries in southern Africa, which contribute a tiny amount to global heating, underlining their call for more help from rich nations to deal with the impacts of climate change.Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",
