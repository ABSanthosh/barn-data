Among the key points raised was the possibility of the US taking control of Ukrainian power plants to safeguard critical infrastructure, a move Trump suggested could ensure their security.According to a statement from secretary of state Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz, Trump told Zelenskyy that the US could be \"very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise.\" The statement described the conversation as \"fantastic.\" Trump also floated the idea that \"American ownership of those plants could be the best protection for that infrastructure.\"The discussion marked a notable shift in tone following last month's contentious Oval Office meeting, which resulted in Trump temporarily halting intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine. A senior Ukrainian official, speaking anonymously, described Wednesday's call as \"very good\" and even lighthearted at times, with both leaders joking around. However, the conversation also focused on how a potential ceasefire would be monitored and the technical issues that negotiators must still resolve.During the call, Zelenskyy requested additional Patriot missile defence systems, to which Trump responded that he would work with allies—particularly in Europe—to explore availability, according to Rubio and Waltz.Ceasefire talks amid continued fightingTrump has made ending the war a key priority of his administration, citing concerns over the cost of US support, which has exceeded $180 billion since the war began. His call with Zelenskyy followed a conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin a day earlier, during which Putin agreed not to target Ukraine's energy infrastructure but refused to commit to a full 30-day ceasefire.The Kremlin has maintained that any deal must include an end to foreign military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. However, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reaffirmed Wednesday that the US would continue providing intelligence support to Ukraine for defensive purposes.Zelenskyy, meanwhile, expressed scepticism about Putin's commitment to limiting strikes on energy facilities. Speaking at a news conference in Helsinki alongside Finnish President Alexander Stubb, he pointed to a barrage of overnight drone attacks as evidence that Russia was not upholding its pledges.\"Even last night, after Putin's conversation with President Trump—when Putin said he was allegedly giving orders to stop strikes on Ukrainian energy—there were 150 drones launched overnight, including on energy facilities,\" Zelenskyy said.As negotiations continue, the question of US involvement in Ukraine's energy infrastructure and the broader feasibility of a ceasefire remain unresolved.",
