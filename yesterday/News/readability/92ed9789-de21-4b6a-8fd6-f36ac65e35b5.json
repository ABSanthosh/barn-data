As they grappled with an incomprehensible tragedy, it became clear on Monday that they would have to wait not hours but days for their loved ones’ remains to be returned to them.The authorities continued trying to understand why the flight, which took off from Bangkok and was headed to Muan, crash-landed, speeding along the runway on its belly before crashing into a concrete structure and bursting into flames. The crash tore the plane into so many pieces that only its tail was immediately identifiable, and the only two survivors were crew members who had been rescued from the tail.The scale of the destruction meant that even as most of the bodies were expected to be identified by Tuesday, when the remains would actually be returned to families was another question. Officials said it could take up to 10 days for all of the bodies to be ready for transport because, with the exception of five that were more intact, most were badly charred and in pieces.ImageAmbulances on Monday at Muan airport waiting to transport the remains of crash victims.Credit...Chang W. Lee/The New York TimesInvestigators have recovered more than 600 body parts from the crash site so far, said Na Won-o, the superintendent general of the police in Jeonnam Province, where the airport is, on Monday, adding that officials were continuing to search for remains.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
