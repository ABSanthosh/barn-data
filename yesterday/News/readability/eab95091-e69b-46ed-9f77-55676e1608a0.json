  "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin says he has ordered his forces to \"stop all military activity\" in Ukraine, as he declared an \"Easter truce\" until the end of Sunday. He said the 30-hour truce would last until 22:00 BST on Sunday (00:00 Moscow time), adding that Russian forces should be prepared to respond to \"any possible violations\". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv would adhere to the truce, but accused Moscow of breaking it.\"If Russia is now suddenly ready to truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act accordingly - mirroring Russia's actions,\" he said.\"Our actions are and will be symmetrical. The proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day silence remains on the table — the answer to it must come from Moscow,\" he wrote on X. He said fighting continued in Russia's Kursk and Belgorod regions and Russian drones were still in use, but added that some areas had become quieter. Zelensky said Ukraine would be ready to extend a truce beyond 20 April, seemingly referring to an earlier proposal from the US for a 30-day ceasefire which Ukraine had already agreed to. Responding to Putin's initial announcement, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha wrote on X: \"Putin has now made statements about his alleged readiness for a cease-fire. 30 hours instead of 30 days.\" \"Unfortunately, we have had a long history of his statements not matching his actions. We know his words cannot be trusted and we will look at actions, not words,\" he added. Putin announced the temporary truce at a meeting with his chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov.\"Based on humanitarian considerations... the Russian side announces an Easter truce. I order a stop to all military activities for this period,\" Putin told Gerasimov.\"We assume that Ukraine will follow our example. At the same time, our troops should be prepared to repel possible violations of the truce and provocations by the enemy, any aggressive actions.\"The Russian defence ministry said its troops would adhere to the ceasefire provided it was \"mutually respected\" by Ukraine.It is not the first time a pause in fighting has been suddenly announced - a previous attempt at a ceasefire during Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 fell apart after both sides failed to agree on a proposal. Reacting to Putin's truce announcement, a Foreign Office spokesman in the UK said: \"Now is the moment for Putin to truly show he is serious about peace by ending his horrible invasion and committing to a full ceasefire, as the Ukrainian government has called for - not just a one day pause for Easter.\"Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people - the vast majority of them soldiers - have been killed or injured on all sides. The US has been directly talking to Russia as part of its efforts to end the war, but has struggled to make major progress. Last month, Moscow rejected a proposal for a full and unconditional ceasefire that had been agreed by the US and Ukraine.US President Donald Trump on Friday warned Washington would \"take a pass\" on brokering further talks on ending the war in Ukraine unless there was quick progress.He was speaking after Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was not \"going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end\", as it had \"other priorities to focus on\".\"We need to determine very quickly now - and I'm talking about a matter of days - whether or not this is doable,\" he added. \"If it's not going to happen, then we're just going to move on.\"",
