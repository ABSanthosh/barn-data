  "text": "Former Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz spent tens of thousands of dollars on sex and drugs while serving as a US congressman, according to a long-awaited report from the House of Representatives ethics committee.It follows a years-long investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use by Gaetz, who President-elect Donald Trump wanted to serve as the nation's top lawman.The committee also found evidence that Gaetz, 42, received gifts in excess of permissible amounts in connection to a 2018 trip to the Bahamas. The former lawmaker has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, saying he is the victim of a smear campaign. Amid the controversy, he withdrew from consideration to serve as US attorney general. The congressional ethics report found that \"there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favours or privileges, and obstruction of Congress.\" From 2017 to 2020, Gaetz made payments totalling more than $90,000 (£72,000) to 12 different women \"that the Committee determined were likely in connection with sexual activity and/or drug use\", the report found. Additionally, the report contains testimony that Gaetz paid for sex with a 17-year-old at a party in 2017, giving her $400 \"which she understood to be payment for sex\". Gaetz has denied having sex with a minor.The Department of Justice also investigated an allegation that he had sex with a minor but ultimately did not file any criminal charges against him.In a last-minute court filing on Monday, Gaetz sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the report's release. He accused the ethics committee of trying to exercise its jurisdiction over a private citizen.The committee's 42-page report accuses Gaetz of being \"uncooperative\" throughout its review, and that he would frequently \"deflect, deter, or mislead\" the panel \"in order to prevent his actions from being exposed\".Despite a subpoena, he never appeared before the committee to testify. Gaetz represented Florida's first congressional district in the US House of Representatives, having come to power in the same election in 2016 that propelled his ally Trump to the White House the first time.Gaetz got married in 2021 to his current wife, Ginger, who has supported the former Florida congressman as he's faced the allegations. She posted a photo on X of her husband with the caption \"unemployment has never looked so good\" after he withdrew his name to serve as attorney general after resigning from Congress. Gaetz was believed to be beyond the reach of the committee when he resigned from Congress last month, following his nomination by Trump to serve as US attorney general - America's top law enforcement official who heads the Department of Justice.Trump picked Gaetz in part because he is an ultra-loyalist who had also pledged to take on the \"weaponised\" legal system that supporters believe targeted Trump. He has been one of Trump's most strident defenders on Capitol Hill. But many Republicans in Congress, including those tasked with voting on such nominations, were aghast at the choice and successfully challenged it.Gaetz dropped out just eight days after being nominated by Trump amid a groundswell of controversy. Trump then tapped former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi as his nominee for attorney general. Trump has not yet commented on the report's findings. While it is unusual for the committee to release its findings after a lawmaker leaves public office, the report noted that a \"majority\" of members found it was in the public-interest to do so in this instance. An intense debate had erupted over whether or not the report should be released, particularly after Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration for the top justice department role.He said that he hoped to avoid a \"needlessly protracted Washington scuffle\". Gaetz's slated role as attorney general was one of those that required the confirmation of US senators, and it did not seem that he had the required support.The secretive ethics committee had investigated Gaetz on and off since 2021 - not only on the claims about sex and drugs, but also on allegations he accepted bribes and misused campaign funds. In all cases, he strongly denied any wrongdoing. House Republicans previously blocked Democratic efforts to unveil the results of the report, but two of them later voted to do so, according to CBS.On Monday, Gaetz posted on X that the committee chose to release the report close to Christmas \"and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses\".Last week, he posted that the ethics committee planed to \"post a report online that I have no opportunity to debate or rebut as a former member of the body.\"He acknowledged in a previous post on X that his 30s was an era of \"working very hard - and playing hard too\". \"It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life,\" he wrote. \"I live a different life now.\"Several House Democrats criticised their former colleague and Trump for having chosen him as an ally. Rep Glenn Ivey, one of the five Democrats on the ethics committee, said the allegations against Gaetz show there's a pattern by Trump of not \"putting people in those positions who are really up to doing the job\".\"President-elect Trump should have thought twice before he nominated Matt Gaetz and some of the other nominations he's made, I think would bear reconsideration as well,\" he told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.Since leaving Congress, Gaetz has signed a deal to become an anchor on One America News Network (OAN). He'll join the conservative news network in January.He has also started selling personalised video messages on the video platform Cameo.",
