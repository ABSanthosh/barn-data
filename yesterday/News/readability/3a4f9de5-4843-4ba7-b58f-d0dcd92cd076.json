  "text": "Denis Humberto Navarette Romero and Virginia trailA Honduran man faces rape charges after allegedly assaulting a woman on a popular hiking trail in Herndon, Virginia, US. Police said this is the first stranger rape in the town in over a decade.Denis Humberto Navarette Romero, 31, was arrested last week for abduction with intent to defile and rape, according to the Herndon police department. The victim, who did not know Romero, was attacked on the busy Washington and Old Dominion Trail between Ferndale Avenue and Grace Street when the suspect allegedly grabbed her arm, forced her to the ground, and assaulted her.However, the victim managed to escape and sought help from a passerby, who called 911 to report the alleged crime.“The woman had been walking along the trail after leaving a business in downtown Herndon when she was approached by the suspect. The suspect brazenly grabbed the victim and forced her to the ground, where he proceeded to rape her. The victim was able to fight off the suspect and run away,\" said Herndon police chief Maggie DeBoard in a press conference, as quoted by local media FFX Now.When police arrived at the trail, they located Romero in a parking lot in the 700 block of Station Street and took him to the Herndon police station for questioning. Detectives found items belonging to the victim in his possession.'This is the only stranger rape we’ve had in the town in my more than 12 years as chief of police,\" DeBoard added, as quoted by New York Post.Police believe there may be more witnesses to this incident and other victims who encountered the suspect.\"He has a documented history of sexual assault and exposures in the region, beginning in 2022, including charges in the town of Herndon prior to last night’s incident,” said DeBoard. “What is disturbing is the number of times this offender has been arrested and released. He has continued to re-offend, and his behavior has escalated to a rape in a very public area in our town last night.”On November 14, four days before being arrested on rape charges, he was released from jail after serving half of a 50-day sentence for indecent exposure.Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin criticised the release of Romero, who is in the US illegally. He told The Post, “I am heartsick for this victim and outraged that local Fairfax County officials recklessly released violent illegal immigrants who should have been prosecuted and deported.”Youngkin added, “This is a dereliction of their most basic duty to keep people safe. Prioritizing violent illegal immigrants over the safety of Fairfax residents is unacceptable,” stressing that Virginia is not a sanctuary state.The suspect's preliminary hearing is scheduled for March 5, 2025, according to a local media report.",
