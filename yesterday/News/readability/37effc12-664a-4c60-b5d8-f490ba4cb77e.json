  "text": "At least 11 people were killed Saturday night when an SUV rammed into a crowd in Vancouver, British Columbia, during a large street festival celebrating the Filipino community, police said.A 30-year-old Vancouver man was arrested at the scene, and charged Sunday with eight counts of murder. Police said the man, named in a statement Sunday as Kai-ji Adam Lo, was the only suspect and said they were not treating the deadly event as an act of terrorism.“This is the darkest day in our city’s history,” Steve Rai, the acting chief of the Vancouver Police Department, said at a news conference Sunday morning.The youngest person killed in the attack was 5 years old, and the oldest was 65, police said. Dozens more were injured, some seriously, so the death toll may rise, Rai said.Lo appeared in court Sunday and remains in custody. Further charges against him are expected, police said.Police allege the Vancouver man drove a black Audi SUV into an enclosed area at the Lapu Lapu Day block party in South Vancouver shortly after 8 p.m., and then began plowing through the crowd.Bystanders apprehended the suspect and called the police, Rai said.He said the “evidence in this case does not lead us to believe this was an act of terrorism.” He also said the suspect has “a significant history of interactions with police and health care professionals related to mental health.”The Lapu Lapu Day party is an annual event hosted by the local Filipino community to celebrate the 1521 victory of an Indigenous leader over Spanish forces in the Philippines. Tens of thousands of people were expected to attend the festival throughout the day, Rai said. The festival was scheduled to wrap up at 8 p.m., but hundreds of people were still in the area when the crowd was hit soon after that, he said.The event’s organizers said Sunday in a post on social media: “We are still finding the words to express the deep heartbreak brought on by this senseless tragedy. We are devastated for the families and victims.”Photos from the scene showed a stationary black vehicle surrounded by bodies and a large number of police and other emergency responders.Bystander Kris Pangilinan told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that he saw “countless” bodies.“This car slowly started to pick up speed, and then hit someone,” he said. The vehicle continued to hit people as it drove out of his view, Pangilinan said. “It just kept going and going and going. People were just screaming and trying to run away. It looked like we were in a war zone.”At least 11 people were killed after a man drove through a crowd at a Filipino community festival in Vancouver on April 26. A 30-year-old man was arrested. (Video: The Washington Post)A wooden barrier that had blocked access to the street was removed shortly before the crowd was hit, Pangilinan said. Crowds were pouring into the street after the performance by the festival’s headline act, Apl.de.ap, a founding member of the Black Eyed Peas.Police said a 24-hour assistance center for victims and their families was established at the Douglas Park Community Center.The metropolitan Vancouver area is home to a vibrant community of Filipino Canadians. According to the 2021 census, more than 174,000 residents of British Columbia are of Filipino descent.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney offered condolences. “I am devastated to hear about the horrific events at the Lapu Lapu festival in Vancouver,” he wrote on X. He said authorities were monitoring the situation closely.Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said in a statement he was “completely shattered” to hear about the violence at the festival. “On behalf of the Philippine Government and the Filipino people, Liza and I would like to express our deepest sympathies to the families of the victims and to the strong and thriving Filipino community in Canada,” Marcos said, according to the government-run Philippine News Agency.The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said it, along with the consulate in Vancouver, is ready to extend assistance and support to affected families.Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim wrote that he was “shocked and deeply saddened. … Our thoughts are with all those affected and with Vancouver’s Filipino community during this incredibly difficult time.”The attack came on the final weekend before Canada’s federal election on Monday, which sees Carney and his governing Liberal Party go up against the Conservative Party.Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre also gave his condolences to the families affected. “All Canadians are united with you in mourning the loss of these treasured lives,” he said at a stop at a Filipino church in Ontario on Sunday.",
