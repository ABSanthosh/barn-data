  "text": "More than 1,000 people have been detained in Turkey in the past five days in a crackdown on escalating demonstrations, in which hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets of Istanbul and other cities after the arrest of Istanbul’s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, a key rival of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.The anti-government demonstrations are the country’s largest in over a decade. Authorities have detained at least 1,133 people, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said in a post on X on Monday. Footage and photos from the protests show police wielding ballistic shields and using water cannons and pepper spray to break up large crowds as they clash with demonstrators.In a televised address Monday, Erdogan said 123 security personnel had been injured in attacks by vandals, for which he blamed the “main opposition leader and his associates,” referring to Imamoglu’s Republican People’s Party, or CHP. Yerlikaya alleged that stones, fireworks, molotov cocktails and axes were among items seized from demonstrators.Imamoglu, a popular politician, was jailed by a court on Sunday pending a trial on corruption charges. He was expected to become Erdogan’s main challenger in the next presidential race after his nomination in the CHP’s primary elections on Sunday, which proceeded even after his arrest. Protesters see his detention as a politically motivated attack to keep him from holding office.The CHP called for people to peacefully gather across the country to “stand up for our future and future president.” CHP Chairman Ozgur Ozel said more than 14 million people voted in the party’s nomination process on Sunday at improvised “solidarity ballot boxes” across the country to show symbolic support for Imamoglu. About 1.5 million delegates voted in the party’s primary.Police officers in Istanbul pepper-sprayed a demonstrator wearing religious clothes at a protest on March 23. (Video: Cumhuriyet Irem Karatas via Reuters)Imamoglu “is currently on the road to prison, but he is also on the road to the presidency. The nation is repelling a coup through solidarity ballot boxes,” Ozel told reporters Sunday. He later addressed giant crowds of supporters in the Sarachane area of Istanbul and said the results of the solidarity vote have thrown Erdogan’s legitimacy into question.Erdogan has led Turkey for 22 years and has increasingly tightened his control over state institutions and deepened restrictions on speech and expression.Several journalists covering the protests were arrested in police raids at their homes, according to the Disk-Basin-Is media workers union.Erdogan on Monday called the demonstrations an orchestrated show and said, “The opposition’s performance will eventually come to an end, and they will feel ashamed of the damage they have done to our country.”X on Sunday put out a statement saying it objected to Turkish authorities’ court orders to block over 700 accounts of news organizations, journalists, politicians and students in Turkey.“We believe this decision from the Turkish government is not only unlawful, it hinders millions of Turkish users from news and political discourse in their country,” X’s Global Government Affairs account said, adding that it will defend these principles through the legal system.",
