  "text": "Irmgard Furchner, a German secretary who dutifully served the commandant of a Nazi concentration camp, a chapter of her early life that was exhumed decades later when she was convicted of being an accessory to more than 10,000 murders in one of the final efforts to bring legal justice to victims of the Holocaust, has died at 99.Frederike Milhoffer, a press officer for the courthouse in Itzehoe, the city in northern Germany where Ms. Furchner was tried and in 2022 received a two-year suspended sentence, confirmed her death but did not provide other details. Der Spiegel, the German newsmagazine, reported on April 7 that Ms. Furchner died Jan. 14.Ms. Furchner lived a quiet life in Germany until her 90s, when she was summoned to a courtroom and catapulted to international headlines. Her case stirred debate about the moral culpability of people in dark times who are often described as cogs in the proverbial wheel — individuals who do not design or carry out atrocities but help, in workaday ways, to make them happen.Ms. Furchner, then unmarried and known by her maiden name, Irmgard Dirksen, was 18 when she reported for work in June 1943 as a secretary to Paul Werner Hoppe, the commandant of Stutthof, a concentration camp near what was then the German-held city of Danzig and is now the Polish city of Gdansk. According to German legal documents, she was the sole shorthand typist at the camp headquarters.Working from the commandant’s villa, Ms. Furchner took dictation, managed correspondence and processed paperwork, responsibilities that at first glance might seem no different from those entrusted to any other secretary.The superficially mundane nature of her job belied the barbarism of the operations it supported. Originally used as a police internment camp, Stutthof was converted the year before Ms. Furchner’s arrival into a full-fledged concentration camp.Secretaries employed by the Nazi apparatus often wielded considerable power, Wendy Lower, a professor of history at Claremont McKenna College in California and the author of “Hitler’s Furies: German Women in the Nazi Killing Fields” (2013), said in an interview. History has recorded examples of secretaries who removed names from deportation lists and issued lifesaving labor cards, she noted, while other clerical workers chose to take no such actions.Among the documents Ms. Furchner typed, the German newspaper Die Welt reported, were deportation lists and execution orders.As many as 100,000 people, including Jews and a larger number of non-Jewish Poles, were interned at Stutthof, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. Many prisoners were subjected to forced labor. Those who were declared unable to work were gassed or killed by lethal injection and then incinerated in the camp’s crematorium.By the end of the war, more than 60,000 people had died at Stutthof. Nazis and their collaborators killed 6 million Jews in the Holocaust and persecuted and killed millions of non-Jews during the same period.Immediately after the end of the war, efforts were undertaken by the Allied victors to prosecute Nazis for their crimes. Major trials, such as the international tribunal at Nuremberg, Germany, from 1945-1946 and the execution of Adolf Eichmann, a principal architect of the Holocaust, in Israel in 1962 captured the public’s attention. But many smaller-scale legal proceedings unfolded across Europe over the years, including a trial in Gdansk of Stutthof personnel in 1946.For decades after the war in many West German and then reunified German courts, Nazi defendants could not be convicted of murder or accessory to murder without conclusive evidence of their direct involvement in the killing.In the context of concentration camps that employed hundreds of guards and other personnel, and where relatively few witnesses lived to testify against them, this standard proved a heavy burden, according to Christopher R. Browning, a scholar of the Holocaust and professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. With the passage of time and the increasing infirmity of surviving victims and perpetrators, prosecutions became even more difficult.German jurisprudence changed course in 2011, when John Demjanjuk, a native Ukrainian who was naturalized as a U.S. citizen after the war and worked for years in a Cleveland auto factory, was convicted in Munich of participating in the murder of 28,000 people during his tenure as a guard at Sobibor, a Nazi killing center in occupied Poland.Demjanjuk’s conviction was significant, according to scholars, because it rested on the simple fact of his employment at Sobibor — a place whose express purpose was mass murder — and not on his specific acts there.His case helped lead to the prosecutions of Oskar Groening, a German SS guard who was trained as a bank teller and became known by the time of his trial in 2015 as the “bookkeeper of Auschwitz,” as well as Ms. Furchner. She was indicted in 2021 after a five-year investigation.At first, Ms. Furchner claimed that her age and physical impairment prevented her from appearing in the courtroom. “I want to spare myself these embarrassments and don’t want to make myself the laughingstock of humanity,” she further told a judge before her trial began, according to the Guardian.On the day in September 2021 when she was scheduled to formally hear the charges brought against her, Ms. Furchner fled her Hamburg assisted-living center in a cab. She was located several hours later in a subway station and was taken into temporary custody. The trial began in October, with Ms. Furchner in attendance.Because she was not yet 21 during her employment at Stutthof, Ms. Furchner was tried — at age 96 — in a juvenile court. The prosecution alleged that through her clerical work, she had helped ensure “the smooth functioning of the camp.” Ms. Furchner’s lawyer insisted that she did not have knowledge of the murderous operations of the camp, a claim the prosecutor found unconvincing.“If the defendant looked out of the window, she could see the new prisoners who were being selected,” the prosecutor argued, according to Die Welt. “Nobody could miss the smoke from the crematorium or not notice the smell of burned corpses.”Ms. Furchner argued that her window faced away from the camp.Survivors testified at her trial about the conditions they endured at Stutthof — the interminable roll calls, the crippling hunger and paralyzing cold, the outbreaks of typhus in which victims were abandoned and left to die, the mountainous stacks of cadavers.One survivor, Josef Salomonovic, who was roughly 6 when he arrived at Stutthof, testified with a photo of his murdered father in hand. “For me, she’s indirectly guilty,” he later told journalists of Ms. Furchner. “Maybe she only stamped the death certificate of my father.”After a trial that lasted more than a year, Ms. Furchner was found to have been an accessory to 10,505 murders and an accessory to five attempted murders at Stutthof. The judge, Dominik Gross, declared it “beyond imagination” that the smoke from the crematorium had escaped her notice.Ms. Furchner spoke little at her trial but did offer a brief comment in a closing statement.“I’m sorry for what happened, and I regret that I was at Stutthof at the time,” she remarked, according to Der Spiegel. “I can’t say any more.”Irmgard Magdalene Dirksen was born on May 29, 1925, in what was then the Free City of Danzig. The German newspaper Die Tageszeitung reported that she completed a business apprenticeship and worked at a bank before receiving her secretarial position at Stutthof.According to Die Welt’s coverage of her trial, Ms. Furchner was not obliged to work at the camp; she had willingly applied for her position and, in the assessment of the judge, could have left at any time and sought new employment through the German labor office.Ms. Furchner remained at Stutthof until early April 1945, months after the first inmates were dispatched from the camp on infamous death marches. Soviet forces liberated Stutthof on May 9, 1945. After the war, she was married to Heinz Furchstam, an SS officer she met at the camp’s switchboard. The couple later took the surname Furchner.In the mid-1950s, under questioning in legal proceedings against Hoppe, Ms. Furchner evinced apparent pride in her central role in the administrative operations of the camp. “All correspondence … passed through my hands,” she reportedly said.Hoppe was convicted in a West German court of being an accessory to murder and ultimately served seven-and-a-half years of a nine-year sentence. He died in 1974.Ms. Furchner did administrative work in northern Germany after the war. Her husband died in 1972. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.Like other recent prosecutions of low-level Nazi functionaries, Ms. Furchner’s trial prompted questions about the purpose of bringing elderly defendants before a court decades after the commission of alleged crimes that were, by all accounts, indirect.Andrej Umansky, a German lawyer and professor of Holocaust studies at Georgetown University, said in an interview that the importance of trials such as Ms. Furchner’s extends beyond the guilt or innocence of a single defendant.In many cases, he said, the gathering of evidence represents “the last chance to put more light on these crimes because, unfortunately, many things that happened in the camps … are still unknown.”Furthermore, he said, the trials serve to remind observers how quickly ordinary people are drawn into terrible events.“You don’t need to be a killer. You can be just a small part of the machine,” Umansky observed. “This is why it’s so important to have these trials as a mirror to ourselves, to ask yourself: What would I do in the place of Irmgard Furchner?”",
