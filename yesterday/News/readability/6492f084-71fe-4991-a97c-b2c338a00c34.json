  "text": "Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha met members of Syria’s leadership Monday in Damascus, where he voiced Kyiv’s support for the country’s new rulers and expressed hopes that the two nations could restore diplomatic ties.“I am here to deliver a personal message from President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky to the Syrian people: We stand with you,” Sybiha told his Syrian counterpart, Asaad Hassan al-Shaibani, according to a readout from the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. Sybiha also met with Syrian interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa.The comments mark a sharp contrast with Ukraine’s previously strained ties with the Russian-backed regime of former president Bashar al-Assad, underscoring how quickly Moscow’s influence on the Middle Eastern nation has diminished in recent weeks.“We have the opportunity to help restore stability in Syria after years of Russian interference,” Zelensky said Monday evening of Sybiha’s visit. “I really hope that post-Assad Syria will respect international law — something Assad couldn’t and didn’t want to do.”Ukraine severed diplomatic ties with Syria in 2022, after Assad’s regime recognized the declared independence of Donetsk and Luhansk by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.“This is the first visit by an official Ukrainian delegation to Syria in many years. It demonstrates our readiness to open a new chapter in bilateral relations with Syria,” Sybiha said Monday, announcing that some 500 tons of Ukrainian flour were scheduled to be delivered to Syria in humanitarian aid on Tuesday.“The Russian and Assad regimes supported one another because their foundations lie in violence and torture,” he said, seeking to draw a direct contrast between Kyiv’s offer of aid and Russia’s years-long role in propping up the ousted Assad regime.Shaibani said the two nations hoped to deepen ties, according to the Syrian state news agency Sana. “There will be strategic partnerships between us and Ukraine on the political, economic and social levels, and we also have scientific partnerships,” he said.The future of Russia’s presence in Syria remains uncertain.Syria’s new leaders have met with foreign officials over the past few weeks, including key players in the region and the West. U.S. officials held talks in Damascus on Dec. 20 and lifted a $10 million bounty on Sharaa, head of the U.S.-designated terrorist group Hayʼat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which led the push to oust Assad.On Monday, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan al-Saud, invited his new counterpart to visit Saudi Arabia.",
