He reported this story from Kunduz, Afghanistan.Dec. 24, 2024Updated 2:11 p.m. ETThe Taliban were inching closer, encroaching on land that had once seemed secure, the American officer warned. Four of his men had just been killed, and he needed Afghans willing to fight back.“Who will stand up?” the officer implored a crowd of 150 Afghan elders.The people in Kunduz Province were largely supportive of the Americans and opposed to the Taliban. But recruiting police officers was slow going and, by the summer of 2009, local officials and the American officer — a lieutenant colonel from the Georgia National Guard — landed on a risky approach: hiring private militias.A murmur of discontent passed through the crowd.“I don’t think this is a good idea,” an old man stood up and said, according to four people at the meeting. “We have seen this before. The militias will become a bigger problem than the Taliban.”Over the grumbling, a onetime warlord named Mohammad Omar sprung up and denounced the others as cowards.“I will fight the Taliban!” he shouted.The gathering in Kunduz, in northern Afghanistan, is not registered in any official history of the war. But people across the province say this seemingly unremarkable moment reshaped the conflict in ways that Washington has never truly understood.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
