  "text": "In a chaotic scene on Thursday, Democratic US Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed, pushed to the ground and handcuffed during Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s news conference in Los Angeles. The incident was captured on video and has sparked national outrage and renewed criticism of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.The California representative interrupted Noem’s event to raise questions about recent immigration raids that have triggered protests across the state and the country. Tensions flared after Noem said that federal forces were not retreating but instead planned to intensify operations to \"liberate\" the city from its \"socialist\" leadership.“I’m Sen. Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary,” Padilla shouted as a Secret Service agent grabbed him by the jacket and shoved him out of the room. A scuffle ensued in the hallway, where he was seen on his knees before being pushed to the floor and restrained by several officers.“Hands off!” he yelled during the altercation.The Department of Homeland Security later defended the actions of officers, claiming Padilla “chose disrespectful political theatre” and did not identify himself. However, the video clearly shows him stating his name and position. DHS also said that Padilla “was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply,” adding that officers “acted appropriately.”Padilla explained he was seeking answers about “increasingly extreme immigration enforcement actions” after receiving no response to prior inquiries. “If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question… I can only imagine what they are doing to farmworkers, to cooks, to day labourers,” he said.Such treatment of a sitting senator drew immediate condemnation from fellow Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called it “despicable” and said, “We need immediate answers to what the hell went on.” Kamala Harris described the event as “a shameful and stunning abuse of power.”Meanwhile, Noem later told Fox LA she had a “great” conversation with Padilla but criticised his behaviour as inappropriate. The White House accused the senator of “grandstanding.”Republicans defended Noem, with House Speaker Mike Johnson accusing Padilla of “charging” at her and suggesting the act was worthy of censure. Meanwhile, Democrats in Congress are now demanding an investigation into the incident.",
