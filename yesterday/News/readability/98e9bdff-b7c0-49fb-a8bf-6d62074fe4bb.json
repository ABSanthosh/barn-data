  "text": "JERUSALEM — Hamas on Monday released Israeli American Edan Alexander after more than 19 months in captivity in the Gaza Strip, a result of direct talks between U.S. and Hamas officials in recent days.The militants handed Alexander to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza on Monday evening local time. The 21-year-old soldier was transferred to the Israeli military and flown to a facility in southern Israel for medical tests and to reunite with his mother and other family members. The Israel Defense Forces later released footage and images of Alexander tearfully embracing some of his relatives.Podcast episodeHe might soon fly to Qatar to meet President Donald Trump and Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Alexander’s family told Israeli media. Trump is headed to the Middle East this week for the first international trip of his second term, with stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.Crowds cheered along the roadside as Edan Alexander arrived in Israel on May 12, after being released by Hamas. (Video: Reuters)Alexander’s transfer to Israel came less than 24 hours after Hamas said late Sunday that it would release him unconditionally as part of an effort to revive ceasefire talks with Israel. Palestinian militants abducted Alexander, who was serving in the military near the Gaza border, on Oct. 7, 2023, along with 250 others.He was the last living American hostage in Gaza, and his release was seen as a goodwill gesture to the Trump administration. Hamas is ready to “immediately begin” negotiations to reach a permanent ceasefire and rebuild Gaza, it said in a statement Monday night.On Monday, Alexander was freed without fanfare, a notable departure from the staged ceremonies Hamas organized for other hostage transfers during a brief ceasefire earlier this year. Israeli and U.S. officials had criticized those public displays as exploitative and cruel.“This was a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators — Qatar and Egypt — to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones. Hopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Sunday night.The negotiations bypassed Israeli officials, in what many here interpreted as a sign of increasingly strained relations between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel learned about the deal to release Alexander only late Sunday, according to an Israeli individual familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk with reporters.Netanyahu met with Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee in Jerusalem on Monday afternoon to discuss the latest efforts to achieve a larger hostage deal, the prime minister’s office said in a statement. Netanyahu also thanked Trump in a phone call Monday for helping to secure Alexander’s release and ordered an Israeli delegation to travel to Doha on Tuesday for talks.“The Prime Minister made clear that negotiations will take place only under fire,” the statement said.Israel’s security cabinet approved plans last week to expand operations in Gaza, including by seizing and holding more territory in the besieged Palestinian enclave. More than 52,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.But the vast majority of Israelis think their country should pursue a ceasefire deal to bring home all the hostages, according to recent polls, and disillusionment with the war is growing among reservists whom Israel relies on to carry out the fight.Netanyahu sought to persuade a skeptical public Monday night that his decision to prolong the war contributed to Alexander’s release.“This was achieved thanks to our military pressure and the diplomatic pressure applied by President Trump. This combination is a winning formula,” he said in a video posted to social media.Alexander’s family made clear Monday they intend to keep pushing for a deal to free the remaining hostages and end the war.“We will use our voice to make sure everyone gets out,” Adi Alexander, Edan’s father, told Israel’s Channel 12 news after he landed in the country along with his two younger children, Mika and Roy, on Monday evening.Edan’s maternal grandmother, Varda Ben Baruch, 70, said in an interview in her Tel Aviv apartment Monday that she hopes the release of her grandson will usher in “a new era to the world, and peace will arrive.”“The road to peace doesn’t go through war,” she said.Alexander, born in Israel and raised largely in New Jersey, volunteered to join the IDF after he graduated from high school three years ago, according to news outlet NorthJersey.com. On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants streamed into southern Israel, killed about 1,200 people, captured Alexander and some 250 others and dragged them to Gaza.Ceasefire deals and several Israeli rescue missions brought about the release of 145 hostages. The military has retrieved the bodies of dozens more. Fifty-eight Israelis remain in Gaza, 23 of whom are believed to be alive. Trump sent their families into a panic in recent days when he suggested that the number thought to be alive had fallen to 21.The bodies of four Americans presumed by Israel to be dead — Omer Neutra, Itay Chen, Gadi Haggai and Judi Weinstein Haggai — are still being held by militants in GazaFamily members of the remaining hostages, speaking at a rally of supporters in Tel Aviv on Monday, pleaded with the Trump administration and Netanyahu to help bring their loved ones home.“My son Nimrod is still alive, still struggling down in the tunnels, still has to wait until our prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will come to the decision that his best way to survive as a prime minister is to free the hostages. I don’t want to wait,” Yehuda Cohen, father of IDF soldier Nimrod Cohen, 20, who was captured from the same base as Alexander, told the crowd.“Mr. Donald Trump, special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, Adam Boehler: Please continue the job,” he said.Trump has teased plans to announce a diplomatic breakthrough in the Middle East during his tour, and negotiations to reach a ceasefire in Gaza kicked into high gear in recent days, according to Hamas officials and mediating countries Egypt and Qatar.Witkoff was probably sent Monday to “deliver the message, from Trump to Netanyahu, that this is Israel’s last chance to sign on to a bigger deal,” the Israeli individual familiar with talks said, “one that would include more or all the hostages, as well as Saudi normalization, which would require a Palestinian component, and for which Netanyahu has huge majority support in the Knesset.”For Netanyahu, though, ending the war could mean losing the support of his hawkish far-right coalition partners and probably catalyzing his political downfall.An Israeli official said the government intended to move forward on its plans to escalate the war in Gaza if a ceasefire agreement doesn’t come together soon.For more than two months, Israel has blocked any humanitarian aid from entering the Strip, plunging its inhabitants deeper into a humanitarian crisis. The world’s leading body on food emergencies said Monday Gaza faces “critical” risk of famine.“If no deal is reached to release additional hostages under the Witkoff framework before Trump leaves the region — we will launch the intensified operation,” the Israeli official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues.Soroka, Rubin and Levine reported from Tel Aviv and El Chamaa from Beirut.
