  "text": "Trump signs executive orders on Day 1Donald Trump wasted no time after being sworn in as the 47th president of the United States, signing a series of executive actions aimed at delivering on his campaign promises and reversing many of his predecessor Joe Biden's policies. The orders touch on a broad range of issues, including immigration, climate change, federal regulations, and the economy.Here's a look at the full list of executive orders signed by Donald Trump on Day 1 of presidency:Rescinded Biden administration orders: Revocation of 78 executive actions from the previous administration, targeting policies on climate change, racial equity, ethics, and immigration.Ending birthright citizenship: Barred citizenship for children born in the US to undocumented immigrants or temporary visa holders.Declared a national emergency on the Southern border: Declaration of border emergency, halting refugee resettlement for four months and prioritizing border security infrastructure.Capital punishment: Mandates strict enforcement of capital punishment, directs the Attorney General to pursue death penalties for severe crimes, and aims to overturn legal barriers against the death penalty to ensure public safety and justice.Establishing Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE): Establishment of a new agency, led by Elon Musk, to modernise federal technology and implement the President's DOGE Agenda for improved efficiency.Federal workforce changes: Ending of remote work for federal employees, reinstated hiring freezes, and removed employment protections for specific roles.Withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement: signals the United States' second departure from the global pact aimed at combating climate change, setting back international efforts to address global warming.End of 'government weaponisation': Order to end the \"weaponisation\" of the federal government, with reviews of misconduct by law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Delaying TikTok Ban enforcement: 75 days grace period provided for TikTok's Chinese parent company to negotiate divestiture, despite legal hurdles.Clemency for January 6 defendants: Pardoned individuals convicted for crimes related to the Capitol riot and dismissed pending charges.End of DEI and transgender protection: Rolled back transgender protections and ended diversity, equity, and inclusion programs within the federal government, aiming to reduce \"social engineering\" of race and gender.Prohibiting federal censorship: Agencies directed to refrain from limiting constitutionally protected speech under the guise of combating misinformation.Drug Cartels as terrorist organisations: Designated Mexican and Latin American criminal groups, including MS-13, as foreign terrorist organisations to bolster security measures.Addressing cost-of-living crisis: Administration to propose measures to tackle rising living expenses.National energy emergency: Declared a national energy emergency to expedite domestic energy production and infrastructure development, addressing critical shortages and securing national security.Withdrawing from the WHO: Order for US to withdraw from the World Health organisation attributed to the WHO's alleged mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, its failure to adopt necessary reforms, and its perceived political bias.Revocation of clearances and ensuring integrity in Intelligence: revocation of security clearances for 51 former intelligence officials involved in politically motivated actions during the 2020 election and former National Security Advisor John Bolton for improperly disclosing sensitive information.Granting Interim Security Clearances: Authorized six-month temporary clearances for aides awaiting federal background checks to ensure swift staff functionality in national security roles.Landmark renaming: Renaming of national landmarks, including reinstatement Mount McKinley and renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, to honor American heroes and emphasize national pride.Reevaluating and realigning US foreign aid: Imposes a 90-day pause on US foreign development assistance to assess its alignment with national interests and policy objectives, aiming to streamline programs and ensure consistency with American values and foreign policy priorities.Beautifying federal architecture: Directed efforts to improve the aesthetics of federal buildings.'America first': The order mandates that US foreign policy be aligned with core American interests, prioritising the nation's needs and citizens.Unlocking Alaska's resource potential: Maximise the development of Alaska's vast natural resources, focusing on energy, minerals, and LNG projects to strengthen national security, boost economic growth, and reduce trade imbalances.",
