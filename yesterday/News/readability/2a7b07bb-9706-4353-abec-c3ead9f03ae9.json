Blinken said he discussed the “urgent and sustained steps” required for Israel to improve humanitarian conditions.Live coverage contributors 11Northern Gaza conditions ‘beyond catastrophic,’ U.N. official saysReturn to menuDisplaced Palestinians were seen fleeing Beit Lahia on Oct. 22, as Israel's military ramped up operations in northern Gaza. (Video: Obtained by Reuters)JERUSALEM — The head of the United Nations’ humanitarian affairs office in Gaza painted a desperate portrait of the northern part of the enclave, calling conditions in the area after renewed fighting “beyond catastrophic.”In an interview with The Washington Post, Georgios Petropoulos described medical workers sheltering in bombed-out facilities, repeated delays in medical evacuations and shortages of aid. His office reported Tuesday that an urgent request to help people trapped under the rubble in Jabalya was denied by Israeli authorities for the fifth consecutive day.Kamal Adwan, the sole remaining operating hospital in the area, is running out of food and crucial medical supplies such as anesthetics, blood, medication and chest tubes, while trauma patients pile in.Petropoulos, who visited the hospital several days ago as part of a medical mission to evacuate 14 patients and their companions, described being trapped at the hospital overnight.“We slept in cars in hospital; that night was very loud,” he said. “They said the hospital was safe, but we could hear rocket fire and shelling and huge explosions.”The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in its most recent update that as of Monday there were still 100 patients at the hospital.Hussam Abu Safiya, the hospital’s director, said shelling around Kamal Adwan has gone on for nearly three weeks, adding that gunfire is being directed at the hospital and at ambulance crews trying to reach the injured.The Post could not immediately verify his claims, but they echo other accounts from northern Gaza.Mohammed Obeid, an orthopedic surgeon with Doctors Without Borders, has been sheltering at Kamal Adwan with his family and treating patients there after a strike on their home last week forced them to seek refuge elsewhere.“There are no words to describe the situation” in the hospital, Obeid said in a statement shared by Doctors Without Borders. “It is disastrous.Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza’s civil defense agency, said Wednesday that the Israeli military, in a message delivered by drones, ordered civil defense and medical teams in the city of Beit Lahia to evacuate and head to the Indonesian Hospital area.“It seems the Israeli occupation aims to dismantle the civil defense system and the medical services in the area completely,” he said in a video that he shared on social media. “This would result in the deaths of thousands of people trapped there.”Hezbollah confirms death of official seen as Nasrallah successorReturn to menuHezbollah on Wednesday confirmed the death of Hashem Safieddine, the senior Hezbollah leader who was widely seen as the successor to the group’s assassinated former leader, Hasan Nasrallah.The Israel Defense Forces said Tuesday that Safieddine, a cousin of Nasrallah and head of Hezbollah’s executive council, was killed about three weeks ago when it struck a meeting of senior Hezbollah leaders at the group’s intelligence headquarters in Beirut’s southern suburbs.Safieddine oversaw Hezbollah’s financial and administrative affairs. The IDF said that he also filled in as leader when Nasrallah was outside Lebanon. Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in late September.Safieddine’s death is another blow to the leadership of the Iranian-backed militant group.Since Hezbollah escalated its attacks on Israel last year in a show of support for Hamas in Gaza, Israel has killed several of its top leaders and jeopardized its communications systems in an operation that caused the pagers and walkie-talkies used by the group to explode.Hezbollah has not yet named a formal successor to Nasrallah.In remarks delivered by video earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Hezbollah’s capabilities had been damaged and that beyond killing Nasrallah, Israel has killed his “successor” and “the successor of the successor.” He did not identify those people.Israel strikes southern Lebanon and Beirut suburbsReturn to menuVideo showed the moment a missile hit a multistory building in Beirut's southern suburb of Ghobeiry on Oct. 22, as a crowd of onlookers watched. (Video: @mhmd.hsn.salami via Instagram)BEIRUT — Israel’s military said Wednesday that it struck more Hezbollah targets across southern Lebanon and in Beirut’s suburbs, including in the coastal city of Tyre, the country’s fourth-largest city.On Wednesday morning, the Israel Defense Forces issued Arabic-language evacuation warnings for swaths of the Lebanese city, not far from its historic Roman baths, warning civilians within a large area to leave immediately. It said that the Israeli air force conducted “intelligence-based strikes” on several Hezbollah command and control centers in the city.In Beirut’s southern suburbs, which Israel has referred to as Dahieh, the IDF said it struck Hezbollah sites used for militant purposes.Israeli forces said Hezbollah fired about 135 projectiles over the border from Lebanon into Israel on Wednesday. In southern Lebanon, Hezbollah militants targeted Israeli forces with rockets and missiles, the Hezbollah-affiliated outlet al-Manar reported Wednesday. The IDF said its troops uncovered Hezbollah infrastructure and weapons caches in southern Lebanon.Explosions and large plumes of smoke were seen in southern Lebanon's Tyre after Israel struck the historic port city on Oct. 23, Lebanese state media reported. (Video: Reuters)Israeli forces said they killed three Hezbollah commanders in recent days, while a combination of aerial strikes and ground raids in southern Lebanon killed at least 90 people whom the IDF identified as Hezbollah militants.Rescue crews were still searching on Wednesday through the rubble of five apartment blocks that were destroyed in an Israeli airstrike that the IDF said was aimed at a Hezbollah target near the Rafiq al-Hariri University Hospital, Beirut’s main public hospital. The airstrike killed at least 18 people, four of whom were children, and wounded 60 more, officials said.Ho reported from London. Lior Soroka in Tel Aviv and Claire Parker in Jerusalem contributed to this report.Hostage families say Blinken meeting left them uncertain of cease-fire talksReturn to menuTEL AVIV — Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with the families of the hostages still held by Hamas on Tuesday evening and updated them on his efforts to negotiate a cease-fire that could result in their release.But with Hamas’s leadership uncertain since the death of its leader, Yahya Sinwar, last week in southern Gaza, the families were left with the impression that “we’re still in a bit of a holding pattern until it becomes clearer when Hamas will be able to make decisions,” said Lee Siegel, 72, a citizen of both Israel and the United States whose younger brother, Keith Siegel, is among those being held by Hamas.Ruby Chen’s son, Itay Chen, was thought to be a hostage in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces announced in April that he and another soldier were killed on Oct. 7, 2023, and their bodies dragged into Gaza.Chen expressed disappointment that neither the United States nor Israel had planned for how to proceed with the hostage negotiations in the event of Sinwar’s death.“He’s not in the picture anymore, and I would have hoped that somebody had a plan to do A, B or C in the event of his death, but we have not seen that,” Chen said.There were glimmers of hope, however. Siegel said that “Sinwar’s death should provide a huge window of opportunity,” but he added it was not clear if and when Hamas would reengage in negotiations. “We hope that they will reengage,” he said.“Israel has the responsibility to lean in as strongly as possible to negotiate a settlement that will allow the return of hostages, which by definition involves a cease-fire,” Siegel added.Chen said he was grateful for Blinken’s efforts to bring back the Israeli and American hostages, but he said he wanted to see “bold leadership to use this window of opportunity.”He added that he does not expect the upcoming U.S. presidential election to significantly impact the hostage negotiations. “We’ve always heard from President Biden that he views this as a bipartisan issue that is much bigger than any election,” Chen said.Blinken: Netanyahu says no plan to reoccupy Gaza with Jewish settlersReturn to menuTEL AVIV — Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he was assured by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that an Israeli proposal to push Palestinians out of the northern Gaza Strip and reoccupy it with Jewish settlers is not “the policy of the Israeli government.”“That’s what I heard from the prime minister who is the authoritative word on these things,” Blinken told reporters at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv on Wednesday as he prepared to fly to Saudi Arabia.Netanyahu, whom U.S. officials often accuse of conveying different messages in private than he does in public, has not provided clarity on his vision for postwar rule in Gaza.Several far-right ministers in his government are pushing for Israel to reoccupy the Palestinian enclave, endorsing it in a proposal at a conference near Gaza this week.“We can renew settlements in Gaza,” National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir told a crowd of hundreds at the conference titled “preparing to resettle Gaza.”Blinken appeared to trust Netanyahu’s denials, saying that “whether it’s retired generals or some members of the government, that is not the policy of the government, and it is certainly not the policy of the United States. We reject it.”Netanyahu’s house damaged by drone, Israeli media reports Return to menuHezbollah, in a statement Tuesday, claimed responsibility for a Saturday drone strike targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence in the Caesarea area. Netanyahu’s office had reported the attack over the weekend and said neither Netanyahu nor his wife was present at the time, and that no one was hurt.The Israeli Military Censor on Tuesday allowed Israeli outlets to publish that a UAV directly hit the prime minister’s residence in Caesarea. (Non-Israeli outlets are not bound by the Israeli military censor.) That day, Israeli media published photos of an apparent cracked window at the residence, citing new permissions for publication by the military censor. Israeli Army Radio also tweeted a photo of the residence’s window.The Times of Israel on Tuesday reported that the drone cracked the glass of a bedroom window but did not enter the home, reportedly due to reinforced glass.Hezbollah said it declared the “full, complete and exclusive responsibility” for the targeting of Netanyahu’s home. “The eyes of the resistance fighters see and their ears hear, if our hands do not reach you this time, then between us and you are days, nights and the field,” the group said in a statement.After the incident Saturday, Netanyahu tweeted that “the attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake.” He said it would not deter him or Israel from continuing its “just war against our enemies” and that anyone who harms Israeli citizens will “pay a heavy price.”After Netanyahu met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday, the Israeli prime minister’s office released a readout of the talks saying Blinken “expressed America’s deep shock at Iran’s attempt, through Hezbollah, to assassinate\" Netanyahu, \"emphasizing that this is an extreme and exceptional event.” It said Netanyahu thanked Blinken, “noting that this is an issue with dramatic implications and should not be overlooked.”A senior State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive talks, later said Blinken merely expressed “concern.” Blinken’s remarks about the incident were in the “context of Hezbollah actions” and he did not directly attribute the attack directly to Iran, said the official.A timeline of conflict on the Israel-Lebanon border A timeline of conflict on the Israel-Lebanon border Israeli military deaths in Lebanon raise questions over war’s scope Israeli military deaths in Lebanon raise questions over war’s scope Hezbollah is undeterred as Lebanon braces for war with IsraelHezbollah is undeterred as Lebanon braces for war with Israel",
