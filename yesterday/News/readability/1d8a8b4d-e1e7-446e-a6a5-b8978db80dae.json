  "text": "DAMASCUS, Syria — Thousands of worshipers crammed into the marble esplanade of Umayyad Mosque in Syria’s capital for the first Friday prayers since the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad. The country’s newly installed caretaker prime minister addressed the crowd, heralding a “new dawn” but acknowledging challenges ahead.Speaking to rapturous chanting, Mohammed al-Bashir praised the victory by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamist rebel group that seized power just under a week ago, ending Assad’s 24-year rule.Live coverage contributors 12Gaza strikes continue, leaving at least 37 dead in Nuseirat campReturn to menuStrikes and fighting continued across the Gaza Strip on Friday, capping a week of cautious optimism among diplomats that a ceasefire that could pause or halt the 14-month war could be within reach.In central Gaza, where much of the population is now squeezed, an Israeli strike overnight killed at least 37 Palestinians sheltering in a post office building in Nuseirat, civil defense spokesperson Nasser Ghareez told The Washington Post.The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement it targeted a senior Islamic Jihad member “in a terror infrastructure site” and declined to provide specific details. “The reports regarding the number of casualties are being reviewed,” the IDF said.In a statement, Hamas condemned the strike.Abd Assar, 33, told The Post he lived about 200 meters away from site of the strike and heard a “large, terrifying explosion” that caused mirrors and glass inside his house to shake.About half an hour later, he went to the site and found three destroyed buildings. “At first, I couldn’t tell which building was targeted,” he said in a phone call. “Residents of the area said the post office was targeted and displaced people were renting apartments in the two other buildings.”He watched as emergency workers and residents pulled bodies from under the rubble. “I didn’t know any of the victims personally, but the scene was heartbreaking,” he said.“This has become a daily reality across the Gaza Strip,” he said. “This senseless war must end.”In North Gaza, the IDF continued its more than two-month-long operation in the border communities of Jabalya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia. The IDF says it is attacking reemergent Hamas targets but has laid waste to much of the cities and ordered residents to evacuate.Kamal Adwan hospital director Hussam Abu Safiya, who is caring for patients at the area’s last minimally functioning hospital, said in a statement Friday “that remote-controlled robots rigged with explosives targeted the area” around the medical center, “instilling significant fear among the patients and causing doors and windows to be blown out.”The IDF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Aid agencies warn that parts of north Gaza are probably already experiencing famine, and the rest of the Strip is at risk due to the compounding humanitarian crises.“Civilians are paying the price” of the “rapidly deteriorating security and humanitarian situation” in Gaza, Muhannad Hadi, U.N. humanitarian coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, said in a statement Friday after a visit to the territory.Alon Rom contributed to this report.Russia packs up military assets in Syria; future of bases unclear Return to menuRussia is dismantling equipment at an air base in Syria and loading it into cargo planes after the ouster of longtime Moscow client Bashar al-Assad, images captured Friday show.The images captured by Maxar on Friday morning show two An-124 cargo planes at Russia’s Hmeimim airfield with their nose cones opened to receive equipment, the commercial firm said.Nearby, a Ka-52 attack helicopter and a S-400 air defense unit were being dismantled, most likely for their removal via the cargo planes, Maxar said.Russia used the base 15 miles south of Latakia to support the Assad regime in Syria’s 13-year civil war. The United States backed some forces against the regime.Assad fled the country for Moscow this week as rebels took control of Damascus, ending the family’s more than half-century of rule.It wasn’t clear whether Moscow planned to abandon Syria altogether. It has used Hmeimim to project power across the Middle East and Africa; in 2017, it signed a 49-year less on the facility. The Russian naval base at Tartus, built during the Soviet era, supports ships in the Eastern Mediterranean.This is an excerpt from a full story.Syrian rebels deliver American to U.S. military post, photos show Return to menuA missing American has been safely passed to the U.S. government after he was freed from Syrian government detention during the fall of the Assad regime this week.Travis Timmerman was found on the outskirts of Damascus on Thursday after being freed from seven months of detention in a Syrian prison. On Friday, the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, also known as HTS, said they handed Timmerman to a U.S. military garrison in southeastern Syria.A U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said Timmerman was transferred to the U.S. military and later taken by helicopter to Jordan.The handover, mediated by the U.S.-based Syrian Emergency Task Force (SETF), was one of the first visible instances of indirect coordination between U.S. personnel and the Syrian rebels who took power this week. The U.S. government considers the rebel group a terrorist organization.SETF shared photos of the handover with The Washington Post. In the photos, Timmerman is seen standing between a representative from Syria’s new interim government and a U.S. Army officer at the Al Tanf garrison in southern Syria.This is an excerpt from a full story.War destroyed and divided Aleppo. Can Assad’s fall unite the city? Return to menuALEPPO, Syria — In this city’s forsaken eastern districts, residents need flashlights if they venture out after dark, to find their way through the rubble that was never cleared.For years a front line between Syrian rebels and the regime, the area was left in ruins when government troops prevailed, as a reminder to all of the cost of rebellion.As Syria reckons with the fall of the Assad family’s decades-long dictatorship, Aleppo is haunted by its history of division. How people can live together again here — and in communities like it across this traumatized country — will help decide the fate of a new Syria.This is an excerpt from a full story.Blinken visits Iraq, Turkey in bid to stabilize region after Assad fallReturn to menuBAGHDAD — Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Friday with Iraq’s leader as part of a lightning tour around the Middle East, as he sought to stabilize an unsettled region following the sudden ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.Iraq shares a long border with Syria and many of the same challenges; the Islamic State established a territorial caliphate that stretched across both countries at the height of its power. The Biden administration has made preventing a reemergence of the Islamic State its top priority in the days since Assad’s Sunday escape to Russia.Visits to Baghdad by Cabinet-level officials are rare these days, with U.S. involvement in Iraq largely having receded into the rearview mirror. Blinken was last here a year ago in the aftermath of Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and Israel’s retaliation against Gaza.But the Biden administration has been seeking to build regional support for an inclusive political transition in Syria that would protect the country’s tapestry of minority groups — including the Kurds, who also have a major presence in Iraq and Turkey, his previous stop.Flying from Ankara to Baghdad in a massive gray Air Force C-17 on Friday, Blinken arrived at the U.S. compound inside the capital’s blast-wall-protected airport before taking a helicopter into the city for a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani.Blinken said after the meeting that he and the Iraqi leader talked about hopes that Syria can transition into a nation that protects minorities and is “hopefully a democracy.” Syria cannot become “in any way a platform for terrorism,” he said. “No one knows the importance of that more than Iraq because of the presence … of ISIS, or Daesh, in Syria, and we are determined to make sure that Daesh cannot reemerge,” Blinken added, using the Arabic acronym for the group.Secretary of State Antony Blinken outlined a goal for a nonsectarian and inclusive interim Syrian government while visiting Ankara, Turkey, on Dec. 13. (Video: The Washington Post)Blinken met earlier Friday with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan as part of a broad U.S. effort that reflects Turkey’s central role in the unsettled future of Syria.It was Blinken’s second day of meetings in the Turkish capital after a late-night Thursday meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as the top U.S. diplomat tries to persuade Turkish leaders not to press their advantage against U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces in northeastern Syria that Ankara says are affiliated with terrorist groups.“We’re very focused on Syria, very focused on the opportunity that now is before us and before the Syrian people to move out from under the shackles of Bashar al-Assad to a different and better future,” Blinken said Friday after the meeting.U.S. officials say that the Kurds are important partners in the effort to combat the Islamic State — and that if Turkey presses too hard, it will inflame Syrian tensions rather than calm them.U.S. grand jury charges ex-Syrian prison official with tortureReturn to menuA former Syrian prison official was charged with torture by a federal grand jury, the U.S. Justice Department said Thursday.Samir Ousman Alsheikh, 72, of Lexington, South Carolina, faces allegations that he directed the torture of prisoners while serving as the chief of the Damascus Central Prison, also known as Adra Prison, from 2005 to 2008.“Alsheikh allegedly ordered some prisoners to Adra Prison’s ‘Punishment Wing,’ where prisoners were beaten while suspended from the ceiling with their arms extended,” the department said in a news release. Prisoners were also “subjected to a device known as the ‘Flying Carpet,’ which folded their bodies in half at the waist … sometimes resulting in fractured spines,” it added.After serving with the Syrian police and state security apparatus under then-President Bashar al-Assad, Alsheikh immigrated to the United States in 2020 and applied for U.S. citizenship in 2023. Alsheikh lied about his alleged crimes to obtain permanent residency in the United States, according to prosecutors.The charges were announced as evidence of the Assad regime’s brutal treatment of dissidents are finally seeing light. The doors of the notorious Sednaya Prison were flung open last week after prison guards fled from rebel groups that toppled the Assad regime. Families have been scouring the grounds to see if their loved ones have survived, only to mostly find corpses.Alsheikh faces three counts of torture, one count of conspiracy to commit torture, and charges of visa fraud and attempted naturalization fraud.If convicted, he could be sentenced to a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for the conspiracy to commit torture charge, 20 years for each of the three torture charges, and 10 years for each of the two immigration fraud charges.Alsheikh or his legal representatives could not be immediately reached for comment.Monitoring the status of hostages still in Gaza after Hamas’s attackWar’s ebb in Lebanon leaves devastation and uncertain futureIsrael and Hezbollah agree to cease-fire, halting year-long conflict",
