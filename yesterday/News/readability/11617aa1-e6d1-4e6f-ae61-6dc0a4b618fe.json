One of Marko Perkovic's popular songs, played in the late Staurday event, starts with \"For the homeland - Ready!\" salute, used by Croatia's Naziera Ustasha regime that ran concentration camps at the time. Perkovic, whose stage name is Thompson after a US-made machine gun, has said both the song and the salute focus on the 1991-95 war in Croatia, in which he fought using the American firearm. Courts have ruled Perkovic can use the salute as part of his song.Escaped zoo lion injures man, 53, in Turkiye: A man, 53, was seriously injured when he was attacked by a lion that had escaped a southern Turkiye zoo Sunday. The lion was later shot dead. The male lion escaped his cage at Land of Lions in Manavgat, in the early hours. Later, he attacked the man sleeping outdoors. \"We struggled, fought...
