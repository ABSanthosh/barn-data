  "text": "Russia and Ukraine are poised to sit down this week in Istanbul for their first high-level face-to-face talks since 2022 — a proposal presented by President Vladimir Putin to counter increasingly loud Western demands for Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire as a pledge toward a lasting peace.On the U.S. side, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoys Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg are expected to attend, in the first sign of movement in the negotiations after weeks in which they appeared stalled.Putin’s offer for talks was immediately backed by President Donald Trump, but European officials and analysts fear it could be a familiar Kremlin maneuver: a bid to stall, buy time and, above all, keep the U.S. president engaged.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, however, took the Russian offer for direct talks at face value and then elevated it to the presidential level, putting pressure on Putin.“We will do everything to make this meeting happen. If Putin is really ready to meet not only in the media, but in real life,” he told reporters Tuesday. “Then at the level of leaders we will do everything to agree on a ceasefire. Because it is with him that I must agree on a ceasefire. Because only he decides this.”Faced with a U.S. and European demand for a 30-day ceasefire, Putin offered direct negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Turkey for Thursday. He made the move even though Russian pundits have been pushing a narrative for weeks that talks with Kyiv are not possible because of Zelensky’s supposed lack of legitimacy.“If they were interested in peace, they could stop [attacking Ukraine] right now,” European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told reporters at a democracy summit Tuesday in Copenhagen. “Russia is clearly playing games, trying to buy time.”Putin’s intermittent ceasefire offers and now the possibility of direct talks with Ukraine have bought him precious time, delaying Western demands for a 30-day ceasefire by at least a few days. His overture also pierced the transatlantic unity that lasted for about a day when Europe and Ukraine jointly pressed for an unconditional truce with Trump’s support, backed by the threat of fresh, punishing sanctions.With the news of a meeting in Turkey, Western leaders hit the brakes on the new restrictions.“We are awaiting Mr. Putin’s compliance, and we agree that if there is no real progress this week, we will then jointly advocate for a significant tightening of sanctions at the European level,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said at a news conference Tuesday.“We will look at other areas, such as the energy sector and the financial market. … Now it’s really up to Putin to accept this offer of negotiations and agree to a ceasefire,” he said.The opportunities for the Russian leader to buy time have shrunk, analysts said, after Zelensky challenged Putin to a face-to-face meeting in Turkey and Trump floated a detour from his three-day Middle East trip to potentially join the summit.Zelensky will travel to Ankara this week to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and he has said he is ready to head to Istanbul to meet Putin if the Russian leader shows up.“Putin can’t respond [positively] to Zelensky’s offer because the tough-guy image is basically the most important condition for the stability of his regime,” said Russian political analyst Vladimir Pastukhov. “Trump can throw Putin a life vest to save face in a situation where Zelensky responded by raising the stakes to a level of a personal meeting. … Putin could pretend that he is talking to Trump, while Zelensky is just standing next to them.”Pastukhov argued that the Russia-Ukraine war is approaching a key moment when Putin will have to decide whether now is the time to jump onto the opportunity dangled by Trump to exit the war and recoup losses suffered by Russia or head into a summer military campaign, where he will try to inflict, if not a strategic, then an operational tactical defeat on Ukrainian forces.“He thinks he may end up with a better set of cards in his hands, but it can of course get worse, and that is the risk for him,” Pastukhov said. “His reasoning is that he is not convinced Trump will continue military aid to Ukraine.”The Kremlin has yet to announce who will lead the Russian delegation. Putin’s spokesman pointedly said in a Tuesday briefing that the names will be revealed “when the president deems it necessary,” suggesting that Moscow is holding off, waiting to see whether Trump indeed changes his schedule.A senior former Kremlin official speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject said Russia would be represented by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Putin’s foreign policy aide, Yury Ushakov.“Direct talks between Putin and Zelensky are unlikely,” said pro-Kremlin analyst Sergei Markov. “Whether Putin will come to Istanbul for talks now depends on Trump — and if Trump is ready to take responsibility for Zelensky’s behavior.”The first and only in-person meeting between Putin and Zelensky took place in Paris in late 2019, during a Normandy Format summit mediated by France and Germany. Zelensky, then newly elected on a promise of peace and restoring his country’s territorial integrity, sought to make progress toward ending the war in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have carved off a slice of territory in a conflict that erupted in 2014.The two leaders at the time agreed to a renewed ceasefire and to exchange prisoners, but there were no breakthroughs, as neither side could agree on implementing the Minsk agreements to end the fighting in eastern Ukraine.The legacy of that meeting still echoes in Putin’s rhetoric. The Minsk agreements dragged on inconclusively for years and are still cited by Moscow to portray Ukraine as the uncooperative party — but also unwittingly showcase Russia’s go-slow approach to negotiations.In the initial months after the start of the war in 2022, Russia and Ukraine briefly negotiated directly before talks broke down. A major obstacle to Thursday’s talks is expected to be Russia’s insistence on reviving its 2022 list of demands — a proposal widely seen as amounting to Ukraine’s surrender.In a speech over the weekend, Putin repeatedly framed the upcoming negotiations in Turkey as a “resumption” of talks that, according to him, were interrupted by Ukraine.He claimed Kyiv had agreed to the proposal — which included effective Russian veto power over the size of the country’s military — and then the West stepped in and discarded the agreement. Ukraine disputes this version of events.Putin’s foreign policy aide, Ushakov, reinforced this narrative, stating that the 2022 draft should serve as the foundation for any new discussions.Western officials and Russian analysts have indicated in recent weeks that Putin could consider temporarily dropping Moscow’s maximalist demands for territory it doesn’t even control yet and be satisfied with freezing the conflict on the current front line in return for a partial lifting of sanctions and a reset in relations with the United States.But most insist that Putin will not waver from the ultimate goal of dismantling the Ukrainian state because Moscow thinks it would be easy to blame future violations of any ceasefire on Ukraine, allowing the Kremlin to continue the war, analysts have said.“The goal will remain the same, but the tactics could change,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, senior fellow with the Carnegie Eurasia Russia Center.",
