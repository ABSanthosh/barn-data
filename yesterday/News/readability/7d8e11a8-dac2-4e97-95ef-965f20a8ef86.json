  "text": "JAFFA, Israel — A planned transfer of hostages from the Gaza Strip turned into chaos Thursday as militants drove the captives through the streets, drawing crowds of spectators who jostled for a glimpse and angering Israeli officials who briefly delayed the scheduled release of 110 Palestinian prisoners.The tumultuous scenes played out in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, where the Hamas militant group and its ally, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, handed over two Israeli hostages and five Thai nationals to the International Committee of the Red Cross.In a separate, more ordered transfer in northern Gaza, Hamas fighters released a female Israeli soldier, 20-year-old Agam Berger. The exchanges are part of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, which abducted around 250 people when it attacked Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023.The hostages caught in the bedlam in Khan Younis — including Arbel Yehud, 29, and Gadi Moshe Moses, 80 — were ultimately released, and Israel resumed its transfer of Palestinian prisoners, some of whom were sent to the occupied West Bank.“The harrowing scenes in Gaza posed a life-threatening danger to Arbel and Gadi,” Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a statement Thursday.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also weighed in, describing the spectacle as “shocking.”Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Jan. 30, \"Whoever dares to harm our hostages will pay the price.\" (Video: Reuters)“We made it clear to the mediators that we do not intend to accept any risk to our hostages,” he said in a statement. “And I will add: Whoever dares to harm our hostages will pay the price.”The high-stakes releases and tensions around them underscored the fragile nature of the ceasefire, which began on Jan. 19 and is still in its first phase. Under the agreement, the initial stage will last 42 days and include the staggered release of 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.Hamas has freed 10 Israeli hostages so far, while Israel has released 400 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The Palestinians who were let out on Thursday included 32 people who were serving life sentences, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Society. Twenty people on the list will also be deported to Egypt.One of the most high-profile prisoners released on Thursday is Zakaria Zubeidi, a former militant from the West Bank city of Jenin. He was found guilty of organizing deadly attacks inside Israel and briefly escaped from jail in 2021.Israel has sought to limit media coverage of the prisoner releases, which are often accompanied by celebrations. It has warned Palestinians against gathering to honor the prisoners, and in some cases, the Israeli military has raided the homes of prisoners’ families before they are released.Netanyahu is facing fierce criticism from the far right over the agreement, and his coalition partners have threatened to collapse the government, saying the deal has handed victory to Hamas.The televised releases have provided Hamas with effective propaganda moments. The group, which ran Gaza for 17 years, largely retreated from its public role during the war. But since the ceasefire took effect, its fighters and civil servants have reemerged as a powerful political force.At each of the three hostage handovers, Hamas has deployed its black-clad fighters, often sporting green headbands, to gather supporters and parade the hostages. It has staged photo ops and sent hostages off with mock “release certificates.”On Thursday, after leaving Gaza, the hostages were reunited with their families and underwent medical checks, Israeli officials said. Other Israelis who have been released described being held in horrific conditions and reported suffering physical and mental trauma after months in captivity.Hamas fighters captured Berger, the soldier, from her base near the Gaza border on Oct. 7. Moses and Yehud were taken from Nahal Oz, a kibbutz less than a mile from the enclave. The Thai hostages were among the many agricultural workers hired by farmers in southern Israel.The war that followed the Hamas attacks killed more than 47,000 people in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.Israel’s military campaign destroyed much of the territory, displaced nearly 2 million people and caused a searing humanitarian crisis.Since the ceasefire started, emergency aid has poured into Gaza, bringing much-needed food and other relief to a population exhausted by war. This week, Israel withdrew from the Netzarim Corridor dividing Gaza into north and south, allowing hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to the northern part of the territory, which was cut off from the rest of the enclave at the start of the conflict.“It is stunning just how much damage occurred there,” Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, said in an interview with Axios on Thursday, after he visited Gaza the day before.Witkoff, a real estate magnate tapped by Trump to lead his Middle East diplomacy, has been instrumental in ensuring that Israel adheres to the ceasefire. He was in the country for a two-day visit, during which he met with Netanyahu and other senior officials.“What was inescapable is that there is almost nothing left of Gaza,” Witkoff told Axios, adding that he believed it would take 10 to 15 years to rebuild the territory.“There has been this perception we can get to a solid plan for Gaza in five years. But it’s impossible. This is a 10-to-15-year rebuilding plan,” he said.",
