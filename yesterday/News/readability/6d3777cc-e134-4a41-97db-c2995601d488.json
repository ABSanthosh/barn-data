The cathedral will be reopened on Dec. 7, five years after a devastating fire.Credit...Gregoire Campione/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesNov. 13, 2024, 11:15 a.m. ETFive years after a devastating fire, Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris will reopen to the public on Dec. 7 with a globally broadcast ceremony followed by a string of Masses, concerts and other events, officials announced on Wednesday.“We are going to recover the focal point of our life as a church,” Archbishop Laurent Ulrich of Paris said at a news conference.Last week, Notre-Dame’s bells rang together for the first time since the fire in April 2019.France’s Catholics are also “very eager to welcome back the whole world under the cathedral’s vaults,” he added. Once reopened, about 14 million to 15 million yearly visitors are expected at Notre-Dame, a Gothic medieval masterpiece that was among the world’s most visited monuments before the fire shut it down.Archbishop Ulrich will strike the doors of the cathedral with his staff and officially reopen them during a religious ceremony attended by Catholic dignitaries, foreign officials and donors who contributed to the renovation.President Emmanuel Macron of France, who had vowed to reopen the landmark within five years of the fire, is expected to give a short speech in front of the cathedral ahead of the ceremony, which will be followed by a concert. Previous suggestions that Mr. Macron might speak inside the cathedral had sparked criticism that he was flouting France’s strict secularism rules.The cathedral will celebrate its first Mass on Dec. 8 to consecrate the altar, which will receive the relics of several saints. Mr. Macron and about 170 bishops from France and elsewhere are expected to attend.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
