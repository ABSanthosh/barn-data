  "text": "Marco Rubio before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing last weekThe Senate swiftly confirmed Marco Rubio as secretary of state on Monday, voting unanimously to give President Donald Trump his first Cabinet member on Inauguration Day. The vote was decisive at 99-0, with Rubio being among the least controversial of Trump's nominees.Another pick, John Ratcliffe for CIA director, is also expected to have a swift vote, while action on others, including former combat veteran and Fox News host Pete Hegseth for defense secretary, is expected later in the week. Senate Majority Leader John Thune moved quickly, saying he expected voting to begin \"imminently\" on Trump's nominees.\"Marco Rubio is a very intelligent man with a remarkable understanding of American foreign policy,\" Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the senior-most Republican, said as the chamber opened. It's often tradition for the Senate to convene immediately after the inauguration to begin putting the new president's team in place, particularly the national security officials.Democrats have calculated it's better for them to be seen as more willing to work with Trump, rather than simply mounting a blockade to his nominees. They're holding their opposition for some of his other picks who have less support, including Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr for health secretary.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said his party will \"neither rubber-stamp nominees we feel are grossly unqualified, nor oppose nominees that deserve serious consideration.\" He added that Rubio is an example of \"a qualified nominee we think should be confirmed quickly.\"Senate committees have been holding lengthy confirmation hearings on more than a dozen of the Cabinet nominees, with more to come this week. Several panels are expected to meet late Monday to begin voting to advance the nominees to the full Senate for confirmation.The Senate foreign relations committee advanced Rubio's nomination late Monday, while the Senate armed services committee and Senate intelligence committee advanced the nominations of Hegseth and Ratcliffe, respectively.As secretary of state, Rubio would be the nation's top diplomat and the first Latino to hold the position. Born in Miami to Cuban immigrants, he has long been involved in foreign affairs, particularly in South America, and has emerged as a hawk on China's rise.During his confirmation hearing, Rubio highlighted concerns about America's \"unbalanced relationship\" with China. While sharing Trump's anti-globalist views, he's recognised as an internationalist who values American global engagement.Rubio anticipates support from both parties. He would succeed Antony Blinken, who expressed hope for continuity in Middle East policies regarding Gaza and Ukraine's defence against Russian aggression.The Senate is split 53-47, but the resignation of Vice President JD Vance drops the GOP majority to 52 until his successor arrives. Republicans need almost every party member in line to overcome Democratic opposition to nominees, with objection from any one senator forcing the Senate into procedural steps that would drag voting later into the week.",
