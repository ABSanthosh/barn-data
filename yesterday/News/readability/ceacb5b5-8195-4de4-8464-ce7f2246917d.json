  "text": "Former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad defended his decision to flee to Moscow amid a rapid rebel advance a little over a week ago, claiming he had intended to stay in his country to fight a “terrorist onslaught,” according to a statement issued Monday on his Telegram account.The statement, the first post to Telegram under Assad’s name since his Dec. 8 ouster, said he left Syria for Russia from the country’s Hmeimim air base after it came under a drone attack that same day. Assad had left Damascus earlier amid the withdrawal of government forces, the statement said, adding that at no point did he “consider stepping down or seeking refuge.”Live coverage contributors 7Israel strikes Gaza school where displaced were sheltering, killing at least 13Return to menuAt least 13 people, including children, were killed in an Israeli strike on a U.N. school that was sheltering displaced people in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, local health and U.N. officials said Monday.The Israel Defense Forces said Monday that it struck the school — known locally as both the Sheikh Jamil School and the Ahmed Abdul Aziz School — with an airstrike the day before, accusing Hamas militants of using the facility. Both the IDF and the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which administers the school, confirmed that the building was in a designated humanitarian zone in southern Gaza.UNRWA said at least 13 people were killed and 48 were injured, and Palestinian health officials said that the death toll was even higher, at 20 people killed.UNRWA spokeswoman Louise Wateridge said in a phone interview Monday that she visited Nasser hospital Monday morning, where she met people who said family members were crushed by rubble in the strike. Among them, she said, was a 2-year-old girl playing in the classroom adjacent to the one struck, who was pulled from the rubble with a severe head injury that caused her to lose sight in her left eye.The girl’s family, originally from Rafah, had been sheltering at the school for seven months at the time of the strike Sunday evening, Wateridge said. Another 17-year-old girl survived a severe injury to her right leg, which was wrapped up and still bleeding Monday morning, and her mother was crushed under the rubble, Wateridge said, citing her sisters.Hundreds of displaced people were sheltering in the school at the time of the attack, the Associated Press reported.Video of the strike’s aftermath verified by the Associated Press showed blankets and mattresses strewn across the floor, with clothing still hanging on wall hooks. Footage in the same video of a local mortuary showed at least 10 corpses, including those of at least two children, awaiting burial.Analysis: The unique destructiveness of Israel’s war on Gaza Return to menuThe death toll in Gaza has been the source of uncertainty, speculation and heated debate. Since Israel unleashed its war machine on the territory from which militant group Hamas launched its lethal strike of Oct. 7, 2023, we have relied upon data provided by Gaza’s Health Ministry, whose work counting the dead in previous rounds of conflict was seen as accurate, although it doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. Most humanitarian organizations, the United Nations itself and Israeli-friendly governments, including the Biden administration, have broadly accepted the publicized data as the best measure of what has unfolded over the past 14 months.Israeli officials and their supporters abroad scoff at the reported casualty figures in Gaza as the inflated product of Hamas propagandists. They blame Hamas for embedding itself in Gaza’s densely packed neighborhoods. But the undeniable devastation of Gaza and hundreds of documented mass casualty events tell a different story — one that myriad watchdog groups and human rights organizations are trying to flesh out in greater detail.Last week, Airwars, a Britain-based nonprofit that charts civilian casualties in 21st century conflicts, put out a report that examined in granular detail the first 25 days of the war in October 2023. It concluded that, in that time period, “civilian harm in Gaza occurred on a scale unmatched by any conflict” the organization has tracked, which includes the U.S.-led bombing campaigns of the Islamic State-held cities of Mosul and Raqqa.The organization said Israel’s campaign in Gaza “is incomparable with any 21st century air campaign” and “by far the most intense, destructive, and fatal conflict” it has tracked. In October 2023 alone, Airwars reported, 5,139 civilians were killed in Israeli strikes, 1,900 of them children. The figure is nearly seven times higher than the monthly toll for slain children in any other conflict the group’s researchers have monitored.Out of 606 incidents of civilian harm during October 2023 that Airwars has studied so far, just 26 had clear public evidence of the death of at least one confirmed Palestinian militant. Those 606 are less than a tenth of the more than 7,000 such incidents its researchers have monitored that month.This is an excerpt from a full story.Man who mourned 3-year-old granddaughter as ‘soul of my soul’ now also killed in GazaReturn to menuKhaled Nabhan, a Palestinian man who garnered global attention after video circulated of him last year mourning his 3-year-old granddaughter Reem and calling her the “soul of my soul,” was killed Monday in Gaza.In the video, Nabhan held up Reem’s lifeless body to bid her a final farewell, kissed her eyes and called her the “soul of my soul” — a phrase that struck a chord with many viewers.Reem was killed alongside her 5-year-old brother, Tariq, at home in the Nuseirat refugee camp in November 2023 in what the family said were Israeli strikes. CNN interviewed him later that month at the family’s home, which had been reduced to rubble. When the strike hit in the middle of the night, Nabhan told the outlet, he woke up screaming, and searched for family members in the dark. Reem and Tariq were found together under the rubble.“I was just numb. I wanted to get as many hugs as I could,” his daughter, Maysa, who survived but was seriously injured, told CNN. “No matter how much I hugged them, I didn’t get enough.”“I used to play games with [Reem] every day. I wouldn’t just call her ‘darling.’ I would call her ‘my heart, my two eyes.’ I miss her very much,” Nabhan told Anadolu Agency that month.Nabhan was killed at the same Nuseirat camp on Monday, according to medical officials and local media.Khaled’s nephew Saed Nabhan told CNN on Monday that his uncle was killed by a tank shell after running to help people injured by shelling. “What a great man we have lost,” the nephew said. “We will never have someone like him again.”Gaza death toll crosses 45,000, Health Ministry saysReturn to menuMore than 45,000 people have been killed in Israel’s war in Gaza, the enclave’s Health Ministry said Monday, a grim milestone that underscores the bloody toll for Palestinians after 14 months of fighting.Gaza’s Health Ministry, which reported the death toll of 45,028 since October 2023, does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. At least 106,962 people have also been injured in that time. Experts and observers have previously said that the official figure is likely an undercount.Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack that triggered its war in Gaza, including more than 300 soldiers, and it says 384 soldiers have been killed since the launch of its military operation in Gaza.The milestone figure comes as Israel is simultaneously attacking Lebanon and Syria. Israel is carrying out near-daily strikes on southern Lebanon, testing a fragile ceasefire agreement that three weeks ago paused a 14-month conflict that killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon.In Syria, the Israel Defense Forces has destroyed much of the country’s military capabilities over the past week as the country fell to rebel forces. Huge explosions rocked an area near the port city of Tartus overnight. Israel’s Army Radio said that Israeli forces targeted large warehouses of rockets, mortars and mines. The IDF declined to comment.Foreign powers jockey for control in Syria, risking new conflict Return to menuThe collapse of the Assad regime in Syria has set off a scramble for control of the heart of the Middle East, a competition that could defer indefinitely the peace and stability Syrians crave and spill into a wider region already roiled by war.In Syria’s first week without Bashar al-Assad, the longtime despot who fled to Moscow, three foreign powers bombed targets in the country in pursuit of their strategic goals: the United States against Islamic State remnants in the east, Turkey against Kurdish forces in the northeast and Israel against Syrian military assets in various locations.Russia and Iran, Assad’s key supporters and the biggest losers from the change of power in Damascus, were meanwhile rushing to withdraw or reposition their forces in the country. Iran has evacuated 4,000 personnel from Syria since Assad’s fall, an Iranian government spokesman said. Russia has also been pulling troops from its bases across Syria and transporting them to the Hmeimim air base on its Mediterranean coast, although it remains unclear whether the relocations represent a full-scale withdrawal.This is an excerpt from a full story.Analysis: Biden team seizes on Assad’s fall to defend its Middle East record Return to menuThe White House is seizing on the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to mount a defense of its often-criticized policy in Gaza and the wider Middle East, arguing that President Joe Biden’s staunch support of Israel and his approach to the region paved the way for events that led to Assad’s ouster and could bring a new era of cooperation.Biden’s handling of Israel’s war in Gaza is viewed by liberals and a growing number of Democrats as a major foreign policy failure, with some in the party saying his unwillingness to rein in Israel and avoid a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza will tarnish his legacy. Biden and his aides are now working to reframe his largely unconditional support of Israel as a resounding success, saying it led to the weakening of two powerful militant groups, Hamas and Hezbollah, which in turn made the fall of Assad possible.Many Middle East experts and analysts agree that the Biden administration deserves credit for preventing an all-out regional war that could have drawn in the United States directly and for providing Israel with military aid that helped it degrade Hezbollah and Hamas. But they also say the administration’s narrative assigns too much credit to the United States for events that were largely driven by actors in the region.This is an excerpt from a full story.Monitoring the status of hostages still in Gaza after Hamas’s attackLive briefing: Assad defends escape from Syria, blames ‘terrorist onslaught’ in first statementWar’s ebb in Lebanon leaves devastation and uncertain future",
