  "text": "In what he called “a Great Day for Africa,” US President Donald Trump on Friday announced on Truth Social that his administration, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has successfully brokered a peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda. The treaty is aimed at ending one of Africa’s deadliest and longest-running conflicts and is due to be formally signed in Washington on June 27.“I am very happy to report that I have arranged, along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a wonderful Treaty between the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Republic of Rwanda, in their War, which was known for violent bloodshed and death, more so even than most other Wars,” Trump wrote. “This is a Great Day for Africa and, quite frankly, a Great Day for the World!”The announcement follows three days of closed-door talks in Washington between representatives of the two nations. The conflict is centred in the mineral-rich eastern provinces of the DRC and has claimed over six million lives over the past three decades. The turmoil is fuelled by competition for control over valuable resources such as coltan, cobalt, lithium, and gold.The peace deal was initiated at the invitation of DRC President Félix Tshisekedi, who requested Trump’s administration to step in after multiple failed attempts at reconciliation, reports CBS News. According to the US State Department, the agreement includes commitments to halt hostilities, respect territorial boundaries, disarm rebel groups, facilitate the return of displaced persons, and integrate local economies.'Transactional diplomacy'While many welcome the potential end to hostilities, analysts remain cautious. Daniel Van Dalen, a senior analyst at Signal Risk, an Africa-focused intelligence firm, noted that the deal marks a shift in American strategy on the continent. “The days of diplomatic soft power are over,” he said. “This is transactional diplomacy at work.”One major concern is the M23 militia, which controls parts of eastern DRC but was not part of the peace talks. The group is believed to be supported by Rwanda, although Rwandan officials have always denied this. M23 has recently taken over areas in two provinces. “The M23 are still pushing, in spite of peace negotiations, for territorial gains,” Van Dalen warned.Sources told CBS News that Rwanda may agree to withdraw troops believed to be supporting M23 fighters, while the DRC might allow small-scale mining in its territory to be routed through Rwanda. However, without M23’s direct involvement or commitment, observers worry that the conflict may simply continue under new terms.Tiffany Trump’s father-in-law appointed as senior adviser to the White HouseAmid the negotiations, Tiffany Trump’s father-in-law, Massad Boulous, was appointed as a senior adviser to the White House on Africa. He travelled across the region to meet with leaders and promote US business ties, especially in mining. The Trump administration is reportedly looking to re-establish American interests in Africa’s critical mineral supply chain, where Chinese firms currently dominate.The DRC has begun revisiting mining tax laws to make the country more appealing to Western investment. The US has already committed substantial funding to infrastructure, including $560 million towards the Lobito Corridor, a rail project that connects the DRC’s copper belt to an Angolan port, offering a vital trade route.'I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for this': TrumpEven though some people doubt whether the treaty will really work, Trump used the moment to point out what he sees as his ignored efforts to bring peace around the world.“I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for this… but the people know, and that’s all that matters to me!” he said on Truth Social, also referencing previous efforts to resolve conflicts between India and Pakistan, Serbia and Kosovo, and Egypt and Ethiopia, as well as the Abraham Accords in the Middle East.",
