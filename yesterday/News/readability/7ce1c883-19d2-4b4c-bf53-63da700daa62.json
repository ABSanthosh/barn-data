  "text": "More than 250 Venezuelans deported in March by the Trump administration and flown to a high-security prison in El Salvador were sent home Friday in exchange for 10 American citizens and permanent U.S. residents imprisoned in Venezuela by the government of President Nicolás Maduro.The swap at least partially ended one of the most controversial episodes of President Donald Trump’s second term — the secret removal under a 1798 wartime law and indefinite incarceration without charge of Venezuelan migrants he said were members of a “terrorist” gang. Legal challenges to those actions continue.In a carefully coordinated series of events following months of negotiations among Washington, Caracas and San Salvador, the 252 Venezuelans were bused from El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) to be picked up by two aircraft sent from Venezuela. Simultaneously, a U.S.-chartered Gulfstream plane departed a small Georgia airport carrying U.S. diplomatic officials and medical personnel en route to Caracas.Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele later said in a social media post that the releases meant his government had now handed over “all the Venezuelan nationals detained in our country.” He said Maduro had also released a number of domestic political prisoners as part of the deal.In a statement issued after the departing U.S. plane cleared Venezuelan airspace with the Americans aboard about 4 p.m., Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that more Americans had been wrongfully jailed “under highly questionable circumstances without proper due process” in Venezuela than in any other country. He said that “every wrongfully detained American” in Venezuela was now free.Maduro has often accused the CIA and American mercenaries of infiltrating Venezuela in plots to overthrow his government. Successive U.S. administrations have accused him of electoral fraud and human rights abuses and imposed economic sanctions.The State Department has long warned against travel to Venezuela, where Maduro has used arrests of Americans as bargaining tools. Ten Americans were freed in late 2023 in exchange for the Biden administration’s release of a U.S.-imprisoned close Maduro ally. Seven were freed earlier this year in previous deals negotiated by the Trump administration.The names of those released by Caracas on Friday were not provided. Although Rubio and senior administration officials who briefed reporters on the exchange described them all as “Americans,” another official called that a “colloquial” expression and said five are U.S. citizens and five are permanent U.S. residents, or green-card holders. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House.Advisers to relatives of two of the released citizens provided statements. Lucas Hunter’s family has said he was on a windsurfing trip in Colombia near the Venezuelan border in January when he was “kidnapped” and arrested by Venezuelan border guards. “We are grateful that President Trump has made this issue a priority for his team,” Hunter’s sister, Sophie Hunter, said Friday.Venezuela had alleged that Wilbert Castañeda Gomez, a decorated former Navy SEAL, was part of a plot to assassinate Maduro when he was arrested while on vacation in August. “My brother is an innocent man who was used as a political pawn by the Maduro regime,” Christian Castañeda said.A statement released by the Venezuelan government said that all of the Americans had been “under judicial orders for their proven participation in serious crimes against the country, the independence and the security of the nation.” The statement also said, in an apparent reference to the release of political prisoners, that “alternative measures” — usually referring to home detention and regular check-in — had been granted to “a group of Venezuelan citizens who remain detained … for their participation in the commission of common crimes and crimes against the constitutional order.” Later official statements said 80 had been released, although no names were given.Earlier Friday, a plane arrived in Caracas carrying seven young children who Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said had been “kidnapped” by the United States when U.S. agents separated them from their deported parents. The return of the children was part of the new exchange agreement, according to a person informed of the deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it. They were brought to Venezuela aboard a regular U.S. deportation flight from Houston. It was unclear who had custody of them in the United States, where Cabello said the return of 25 more was being negotiated with the Trump administration.Friday’s swap was a remarkable development after Trump, in a high-stakes early bid to claim executive power and prove he was serious about ridding the country of illegal migrants, did not follow a court order, which was issued as the deportation planes to El Salvador were midflight or preparing for takeoff March 15, to halt or reverse the removals. The administration never provided a complete list of the Venezuelans’ identities and subsequently told courts it had no power to force or even ask El Salvador to return them.Many of the Venezuelan prisoners were sent on the March 15 flights within days of being rounded up at their U.S. homes or workplaces. They arrived in shackles at El Salvador’s CECOT prison under an unpublicized agreement between Rubio and Bukele, whose government was paid to incarcerate them.One senior administration official said that Bukele’s initial offer to accept the prisoners provided the “opportunity” to initiate negotiations for an exchange.Trump’s sudden invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to justify more than half of the removals launched a torrent of legal challenges. Federal courts have halted deportations under the act now, although they have issued differing opinions on whether Trump has the power to use it. The Supreme Court has not ruled on the question but has said that the law requires potential deportees be given an opportunity to challenge their removal.The rest of the deported prisoners were sent to El Salvador under regular deportation procedures. The administration said, without presenting evidence, that many were violent criminals. As the Venezuelans simply disappeared, none were given an opportunity to challenge their detention or deportation, and family members were not informed. Inmates at the prison are not allowed any contact with the outside world.Maduro had demanded the return of the Venezuelans, who he said had been “kidnapped,” as a point of national honor, after Bukele offered in April to send them home if Maduro would free all U.S. citizens he was holding as well as dozens of imprisoned domestic political opponents.But an exchange being negotiated by the State Department in May was scotched when it collided with separate negotiations being secretly conducted by presidential envoy Richard Grenell, who told Trump he had persuaded Maduro to resume suspended deportation flights to Caracas in return for the release of the Americans. The State Department eventually resumed talks leading to the final deal.For the returned Venezuelans, the agreement ended four months of confinement in what both Salvadoran and U.S. human rights groups have called one of the most brutal facilities in the hemisphere, where those detained were deprived of access to lawyers or their families.Questioned about his justification days after the deportations, Trump told reporters the Venezuelans were “bad people. … When you look at the crimes they have committed, you don’t get worse than that. These are … drug dealers, drug lords, people from mental institutions.”Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem, on a visit to the prison in late March, filmed and posted a video warning potential migrants of their fate as she stood before dozens of shirtless men with shaved heads, stacked on three levels of shelves inside a cell. They should remain in the megaprison, built to house 80,000, “for the rest of their lives,” she later said.Trump claimed authority to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, which requires invasion by a foreign power, by saying most of the deportees were members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang active in the U.S. that he had designated a terrorist group. The administration said its activities constituted an invasion under the act since the gang was under the control of the Maduro government — something U.S. intelligence later put in doubt.In the Friday briefing, a senior administration official said “all” of the 252 deportees returned to Venezuela were “members of Tren de Aragua,” a sweeping assertion for which the administration has never provided evidence.But numerous news reports and court filings have indicated that many of the Venezuelans were not violent criminals, much less members of the gang. Some of those sent to El Salvador had been legally living in the U.S. — including Kilmar Abrego García, one of 23 Salvadorans included on the flights. When a federal judge in Maryland ordered him returned, the administration said it had no power to do so, since all of the deportees were now under the “custody of a foreign nation” and the matter was out of U.S. hands.Abrego, a Maryland resident, was returned to the U.S. last month, only to face federal charges of migrant smuggling, which he denies. U.S. court filings last week by lawyers for more than 100 Venezuelans challenging their deportations and imprisonment in El Salvador included an acknowledgment by Bukele officials that the U.S., not El Salvador, has “the jurisdiction and legal responsibility” for them.Lee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney and lead counsel for the migrants, said Friday that lawyers are still pursuing due process for them and noted that a federal judge in the District of Columbia ruled in June that the government had failed to give them a chance to contest their deportations. That decision is on appeal.“These individuals have languished incommunicado in a notorious prison known for torture for more than four months with zero due process and now with this latest maneuver the administration appears to be trying to avoid all judicial accountability,” Gelernt said in a statement.Late Friday, the 252 released Venezuelans deplaned on live television at the international airport outside Caracas. Dressed in T-shirts and jeans, their hair grown out, they shouted “Viva,” crossed themselves and bumped fists with Cabello, who waited at the bottom of the stairs.Justin Jouvenal and Maria Sacchetti contributed to this report.",
