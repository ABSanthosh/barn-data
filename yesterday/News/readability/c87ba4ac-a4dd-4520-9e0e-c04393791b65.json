  "text": "Muhammadu Buhari, a self-described “converted democrat” who led Nigeria first as a military ruler and then as an elected president, presiding over Africa’s most populous country for eight tumultuous years as a civilian while struggling to vanquish corruption and militant groups, died July 13 at a clinic in London. He was 82.His spokesperson, Garba Shehu, announced the death but no cause was given.With his decisive victory over incumbent Goodluck Jonathan in 2015, Mr. Buhari became the first opposition leader to defeat a sitting Nigerian president. He took office that year amid widespread dissatisfaction over official corruption, an economy that had plunged with falling oil prices, and a proliferation of kidnappings and attacks by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram.His election marked a dramatic return to power for the former army general, who ruled Nigeria in the mid-1980s while cracking down on dissidents and instituting a “war against indiscipline” in the West African nation. Cheating students were sent to prison, and late-arriving office workers were ordered to perform frog jumps as punishment for tardiness.Mr. Buhari was deposed after 20 months but maintained a reputation for incorruptibility, which helped fuel his political comeback. He carried a broom on the presidential campaign trail, declaring that he would sweep away “the evil of corruption,” and vowed to beat back Boko Haram, which had turned parts of northeastern Nigeria into a war zone.Conflict with the group persisted across the Sahel region, with more than 2 million people displaced by violence in Nigeria alone, according to a United Nations study in 2022. Boko Haram and the Nigerian military reportedly burned villages to the ground as part of the fighting, and in 2017 the New York Times reported that members of the Nigerian army had massacred civilians, ostensibly as part of an effort to weed out militants.Mr. Buhari declared victory over Boko Haram even as his administration struggled to put an end to kidnappings by the militants. His leadership also came under question when he began spending months away from the country, traveling to Britain for extended periods in 2017 and 2018 to receive treatment for an unspecified illness that led many in Nigeria to wonder who was in charge, or if their president had secretly died.Instead, he was apparently gathering strength for his 2019 reelection bid. Mr. Buhari won with more than 55 percent of the vote in an election marred by delays and sporadic violence.Critics had charged that his anti-corruption initiatives were selective and mainly targeted his opponents, and questioned his handling of the economy, which had slipped into a recession. His administration had struggled to tame inflation while introducing poverty programs and working to expand access to education. Unemployment hovered above 20 percent, and about half the population lived on less than $1.90 a day.Still, he managed to evoke a combination of fear and respect that kept him at the top of Nigerian politics, even if that position seemed increasingly precarious by 2020. His government was rocked by protests that autumn against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), an elite police unit accused of arbitrarily arresting, extorting and torturing Nigerians, who took to the streets in rural towns as well as cities such as Lagos and Abuja, the capital.“The government of President Muhammadu Buhari has long been ineffectual, with a kind of willful indifference,” Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie wrote then in a New York Times op-ed. “Under his leadership, insecurity has worsened; there is the sense that Nigeria could very well burn to the ground while the president remains malevolently aloof.”Mr. Buhari announced that his government was disbanding SARS, and promised to crack down on rogue police officers. But security forces opened fire that October at a demonstration against police brutality in Lagos, killing at least 12 and wounding hundreds, according to Amnesty International.The crackdown was condemned overseas but was initially met with silence from Mr. Buhari. When he delivered a national address two days later, he called on demonstrators not to “undermine national security,” adding that his commitment to police reforms had apparently “been misconstrued as a sign of weakness.”Mr. Buhari was barred by the constitution from seeking a third term. Despite his unpopularity, he was succeeded by a member of his own party, former Lagos governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who was elected in February 2023 with 36 percent of the vote.Rise through armyMuhammadu Buhari was born into a Muslim family in the northern town of Daura, not far from present-day Niger, on Dec. 17, 1942. The youngest of 23 children, he was about 4 when his father died, and came of age under British colonial rule.Mr. Buhari joined the Nigerian army in 1961, one year after the country gained independence. He studied at the national military academy and rose to prominence during Nigeria’s civil war in the late 1960s, when he commanded infantry units that helped quash the breakaway state of Biafra.He went on to survive a series of military coups, maintaining top positions in the country’s political system, including as federal commissioner for petroleum and natural resources. He also continued his education in the United States, graduating from the Army War College in Pennsylvania.When the Nigerian government seemed increasingly unstable, rocked by falling oil prices, Mr. Buhari took power through a coup on New Year’s Eve 1983, four months after the country’s president, Shehu Shagari, won a second term through elections that were tainted by allegations of fraud.Mr. Buhari promised new anti-poverty programs and an end to corruption. But when change proved too slow, he was overthrown in 1985. He spent three years in prison, replaced by a deputy. After a coup in 1993 brought army Gen. Sani Abacha to power, he named Mr. Buhari head of a federal oil agency charged with reinvesting money into infrastructure and other social projects.When Abacha died in 1998, Nigeria transitioned to a democracy and Mr. Buhari followed suit. He ran unsuccessfully for president as the opposition candidate in 2003, 2007 and 2011 before defeating Jonathan with 54 percent of the vote in 2015, running as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, a newly created bloc opposed to Jonathan’s Peoples Democratic Party.Mr. Buhari launched an estimated $1 billion environmental project in the Niger Delta, aiming to clean up oil that had soaked the region’s waterways for half a century. He also earned the nickname “Baba-Go-Slow” while taking six months to assemble a cabinet.His wife, the former Aisha Halilu, told the BBC’s Hausa-language service in 2016 that Mr. Buhari hardly knew anyone he had appointed, and that his government was controlled by only a “few people” behind the scenes.“I don’t know which party my wife belongs to,” Mr. Buhari said in response, “but she belongs to my kitchen and my living room and the other room.”Mr. Buhari’s previous marriage, to Safinatu Yusuf, ended in divorce. He reportedly had 10 children, five from each marriage. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.",
