  "text": "US President Donald Trump (Pic credit: AP)US President Donald Trumpon Sunday signalled optimism over the ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran, describing the latest round of talks as \"very, very good\" and hinting that a breakthrough could be announced \"over the next two days.\"Speaking to reporters on the tarmac at Morristown Airport before boarding Air Force One, Trump said the fifth round of discussions, held in Rome and mediated by Oman, had produced \"real progress, serious progress\" toward a potential new deal aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.The high-level talks, which began in April, mark the most substantial engagement between Washington and Tehran since the US unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) during Trump's first term. That landmark deal had sought to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, offering sanctions relief in return for strict limits on its nuclear program.While Trump struck a positive note, describing the diplomatic channel as \"very, very good,\" Iranian officials were more cautious in their assessment. Iran's foreign minister and lead negotiator, Abbas Araghchi, called the negotiations \"too complicated to be resolved in two or three meetings.\"Omani foreign minister Badr Albusaidi, whose country is serving as a key mediator, offered a measured view of the outcome. Posting on X, he said the fifth round had concluded \"with some but not conclusive progress,\" and expressed hope that \"the remaining issues\" would be clarified in the coming days.The latest talks come ahead of a critical June meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna, where Iran's nuclear activities will be reviewed. The diplomatic effort also precedes the October expiry of key provisions from the 2015 deal, raising urgency on both sides to find a resolution.Since returning to office, Trump has revived his \"maximum pressure\" policy toward Iran, tightening sanctions while keeping military options on the table if diplomacy stalls. Still, Sunday's comments suggest a potentially softer stance, at least temporarily, as both sides weigh the cost of continued escalation.",
