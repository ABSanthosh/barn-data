  "text": "For months, the tips had been appearing on a Facebook page. There was a mass grave hidden in a rural village outside Guadalajara, in western Mexico, the messages said.Mexico has grappled for years with a crisis of disappearances, with more than 110,000 people reported missing. Relatives of the disappeared have unearthed hundreds of graves filled with corpses. This seemed like another. But the people who ran the Facebook page — a group in Jalisco state who search for the missing — were puzzled. The grave was said to be in the village of La Estanzuela. But where, exactly?After getting more anonymous tips, Indira Navarro, head of the group, and dozens of other victims’ relatives arrived on March 5 at an abandoned ranch outside La Estanzuela and started poking around. They dug up three underground ovens. They found hundreds and hundreds of singed bone shards — from skulls, fingers, teeth. It was what Mexicans call an “extermination camp.”But the image that’s really stunned Mexicans was of the shoes. There were piles of them — well over 200.“Of course, it immediately evokes the conditions at Auschwitz,” said José Ramón Cossío, the former chief justice of Mexico’s Supreme Court, in an interview with the radio program Aristegui Noticias.The discovery has shocked Mexicans, dominating news reports and prompting an outcry from citizens’ groups, the Catholic Church and lawyers.The country has been wracked by extreme violence since 2008, after the Mexican military — with U.S. backing — launched an offensive against criminal groups who had developed their own private armies. Several other extermination camps have been found in Mexico, and mass graves turn up nearly every week. But the site in Jalisco elicited a particular horror.The camp is a sign of how much criminal groups have penetrated the Mexican economy. They don’t just traffic drugs to the United States; they extort businesses, “tax” migrant smugglers, and run vast networks of contraband goods, from gasoline to wood.Navarro’s group believes the ranch in La Estanzuela was a recruiting and training center for one such crime group. The area is dominated by one of the country’s largest cartels, Jalisco New Generation (CJNG).Navarro’s group — called the Searching Warriors of Jalisco — had been hearing since last year about young people who arrived at bus stations in the Guadalajara area, responding to online ads for jobs as security guards, electricians or farmers. Then they disappeared.Since the discovery of the camp, several individuals have offered detailed accounts to Navarro and Mexican media of what happened there, speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. They said they arrived in the Guadalajara area expecting to meet their employers and were instead taken to the ranch and forced to undergo military-style training. Some people who failed or didn’t follow orders were killed, and their bodies cut up in pieces, according to the accounts. Others died of dehydration or beatings. The recruits were forced to dig the holes, then build makeshift ovens out of bricks and stones, they said.While many people at the camp were taken against their will, others had volunteered to work for the crime group, according to some of the accounts.Criminal groups have become so big that they are major employers in Mexico. They need to continuously replenish their workforce, since their employees are killed or jailed. “Recruiting between 350 and 370 people per week [nationwide] is essential to avoid their collapse,” said a study by Mexican and Italian researchers published in 2023.One reason the camp has caused such outrage is that authorities were already aware of it. The national guard raided the ranch last September, detaining 10 people, rescuing two kidnapped people and discovering one body wrapped in plastic, officials say.Salvador González de los Santos, the state attorney general, said 10 government workers combed the site at the time, using a backhoe and dogs, but didn’t find any other corpses. They “couldn’t examine the entire ranch” because it was too big, he said.The civilian searchers found the graves by inserting simple metal rods into the earth and smelling their tips to detect the stench of decomposing bodies.“A civil-society collective, without any training in police techniques, was able to search the ranch better than the investigating experts,” wrote Sergio Sarmiento, a columnist for Reforma.In recent days, authorities have identified six areas with underground graves at the site. It’s not yet clear how many people were killed in total.Civilian search groups have mushroomed around the country over the past 15 years, as the number of disappeared has exploded. In 2019, at the start of his term, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador vowed to intensify the search for the missing, which he characterized as a problem of prior governments. But after his own commissioner documented a growing pattern of disappearances during his term, she was forced to resign.Navarro, head of the search group, has been looking for her brother for nine years. But she said the sight of the clothing, shoes and other items at the ranch in Jalisco shocked her. “Your skin crawls seeing everything thrown on the ground, seeing the suitcases, the dreams of these young people,” she told Radio Fórmula. “To see how they ended up there because they thought they could have a better life and better salary.”Valentina Muñoz Castillo and Gabriela Martinez contributed to this report.",
