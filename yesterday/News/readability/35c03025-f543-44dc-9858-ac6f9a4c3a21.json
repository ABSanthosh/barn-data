This significant decision was communicated, local media reports said, by the Security Services Division (SSD) of the ministry of home affairs to the foreign affairs ministry. The government, however, refrained from commenting on the decision.Since 2019, Pakistani citizens have been required to secure a \"no objection\" certificate from SSD before being granted a Bangladeshi visa. This measure was introduced as part of broader security protocols amid ongoing political and diplomatic tensions.The waiver of the clearance requirement is being interpreted by many as a sign of improving Pakistan-Bangladesh relations under the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt. It comes barely a month after the govt allowed direct cargo vessel movement from Karachi to Chittagong in Nov.On December 3, Pakistan high commissioner to Bangladesh Syed Ahmed Maroof made a courtesy call on BNP's Begum Khaleda Zia at her home.",
