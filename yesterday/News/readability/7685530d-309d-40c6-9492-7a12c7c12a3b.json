  "text": "Disturbing allegations reveal that a public high school teacher in Queens developed a spooky \"escape room\" which he allegedly used to sexually molest a female student.Investigators said that when his wife and two children were away, Scott Biski, a music teacher at Jamaica Gateway to the Sciences High School, encouraged the girl to have intercourse at his house, which he called \"the bat cave.\"According to the Special Commissioner of Investigation for city schools, Biski, 50, started \"grooming\" the student when she was 14 years old, a sophomore, and it ended when she was a senior in \"a sexual relationship.\"“I now understand that these weird hugs, embraces were actually just groping,” the ex-student, now 25-year-old, told investigators.“He was touching me for sexual pleasure without my consent.”Biski set up \"old desks and makeshift dividers\" in his office and music classroom, allowing students to hang out in his \"escape room.\" According to the New York Post, the allegations also stated that Biski tried to kiss the student there after touching her breasts, but the girl pulled away and \"promptly\" left.He would also ask the girl to play board games with other children at his house. According to the report, she once showed up to discover that she was the only student there. Biski allegedly lavished the girl with expensive presents, including his favorite childhood book, a flute that was only meant to be loaned to students, new clothes, and money, including $200 for Ugg boots.He texted the teenager around 700 times, including 82 times when they were in school, according to the SCI.The girl informed authorities that Biski instructed her to store his number under a false name, \"Arthur Dent,\" \"so as not to arouse suspicion.\" A different student informed SCI that he thought the alias was that of \"Harvey Dent,\" a villain from Batman whose alter persona was \"Two-Face.\"According to court records and the SCI investigation, Biski made the student touch his erection while groping and kissing her in his school office and telling her, \"That's how you make me feel.\"In addition to giving the girl coveted solos and \"outstanding\" college reference letters, Biski assigned her to play lead flute in the school band, according to the student.She claimed that he engaged in these activities as a component of his grooming routine.She informed police that after she graduated, Biski would reportedly \"pester\" her into visiting his home to have sex when his wife and two children were away.The twisted texts kepts also continued.“No Halloween celebration?,” She was in her first year of college when he texted her, \"No slut outfit?\"“No ‘I’m little red riding hood the whore.'”In another instance he texted, “I have risked everything for you. My job. My home. My kids. Everything.”The student informed detectives that she viewed Biski as a \"father figure\" and was \"disgusted\" by his actions.However, the student claimed that the sexual contact was consensual and that it happened after she turned 17, therefore the NYPD closed a criminal case against Biski. The SCI accused the teacher of engaging in \"egregious, manipulative, and predatory\" behavior.Biski was fired by the city Department of Education after the student came forward in June 2022, but according to documents, he continued to get $99,578 in fiscal year 2024 while working for the city until last year.A DOE spokesperson stated that he has \"irrevocably resigned.\"SCI not only suggested that Biski be fired, but it also urged DOE to change school policies about teachers texting children using private phone numbers.The SCI has advised DOE to prohibit staff from reaching students on social media and on their cell phones. It has discovered at least 89 instances in the last five years of DOE staff members engaging in inappropriate text and online discussions with pupils.The 25-year-old former pupil sued Biski last year, accusing him of sexual assault and harassment. Biski sued the DOE in June after it refused to give him legal counsel.",
