The elephant was hit and wounded by the gunshots. The guides were unable to prevent the elephant’s attack and both women died at the scene, police said.It happened at the South Luangwa national park in eastern Zambia, about 600km (370 miles) from the capital, Lusaka.Female elephants are very protective of their calves and can respond aggressively to what they perceive as threats.Last year, two American tourists were killed in separate encounters with elephants in different parts of Zambia. In both cases, the tourists were also women and were on a safari vehicle when they were attacked.",
