  "text": "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos leaves Aman Venice hotel, on the second day of the wedding festivities of Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez, in Venice, Italy, June 27, 2025. Yara Nardi | ReutersAmazon founder Jeff Bezos unloaded more than 3.3 million shares of his company in a sale valued at roughly $736.7 million, according to a financial filing on Tuesday.The stock sale is part of a previously arranged trading plan adopted by Bezos in March. Under that arrangement, Bezos plans to sell up to 25 million shares of Amazon over a period ending May 29, 2026.Bezos, who stepped down as Amazon's CEO in 2021 but remains chairman, has been selling stock in the company at a regular clip in recent years, though he's still the largest individual shareholder. He adopted a similar trading plan in February 2024 to sell up to 50 million shares of Amazon stock through late January of this year.Bezos previously said he'd sell about $1 billion in Amazon stock each year to fund his space exploration company, Blue Origin. He's also donated shares to Day 1 Academies, his nonprofit that's building a chain of Montessori-inspired preschools across several states.The most recent stock sale comes after Bezos and Lauren Sanchez tied the knot last week in a lavish wedding in Venice. The star-studded celebration, which took place over three days and sparked protests from some local residents, was estimated to cost around $50 million.Bezos is ranked third in Bloomberg's Billionaires Index with a net worth of about $240 billion. He's behind Tesla CEO Elon Musk at $363 billion and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg at $260 billion. WATCH: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' wedding sparks Venice protests",
