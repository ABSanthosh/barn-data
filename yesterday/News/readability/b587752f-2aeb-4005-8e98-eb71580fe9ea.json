Israeli security forces near Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv on Sunday after a missile attack.Credit...Ohad Zwigenberg/Associated PressMay 4, 2025Updated 4:14 p.m. ETA ballistic missile launched from Yemen struck near the main terminal of Israel’s international airport close to Tel Aviv on Sunday, after the military failed to intercept the projectile seemingly aimed at one of the country’s most sensitive locations.The strike, carried out by the Iranian-backed Houthi militia, resulted in a temporary suspension of flights. There were no immediate reports of fatalities.Israel’s military said that several efforts were made to intercept the missile and that an impact was identified in the area of Ben Gurion Airport. The military added that the episode was under review.The Magen David Adom emergency ambulance service said it was treating four people who were mildly or moderately injured by the blast and two others who were injured while running for shelter.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called an urgent consultation of his security cabinet on Sunday and threatened retaliation. After President Trump wrote a post on social media later Sunday warning that Iran would be held responsible for Houthi aggression, Mr. Netanyahu reposted the statement and added one of his own, saying he agreed with Mr. Trump.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
