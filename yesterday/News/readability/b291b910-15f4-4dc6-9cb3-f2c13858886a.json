The potential agreements would likely involve scaling back at least part of Trump's brand new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, he added.Lutnick's comments came minutes after the U.S. stock market limped to a close for a second day of sharp declines, spurred at least in part by investors' fears that Trump's aggressive policies will ignite a crippling trade war.After his remarks, U.S. stock futures tied to all three major averages rose.The compromises with Canada and Mexico will likely be revealed as soon as Wednesday, Lutnick said on \"Fox Business.\"Read more CNBC tariffs coverageLive updates: White House threatens even more tariffs on Canada as trade war escalatesCanada, Mexico tariffs create 'ripple effects' on consumer prices, economist saysTrump's tariffs showcase his extraordinary presidential power — and its limitationsTrump's Mexico tariffs could raise prices in days, Target CEO saysChina imposes more tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. goods from March 10Stagflation fears bubble up as Trump tariffs take effect and the economy slowsWhile the Cabinet secretary did not specify what Trump would agree to, he suggested the U.S. president would be willing to meet Canada and Mexico \"in the middle.\" He also appeared to foreclose on the possibility that Trump would lift the tariffs entirely.The Trump administration on Tuesday reimposed sweeping 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports after putting them on pause for a month.Trump, who has held up tariffs as an all-powerful negotiating tool, based the policy on allegations that the neighboring countries were failing to stem the flow of drugs and crime into the U.S.\"Both the Mexicans and the Canadians are on the phone with me all day today, trying to show that they'll do better,\" Lutnick said Tuesday afternoon.\"And the President is listening because, you know, he's very, very fair and very reasonable.
