  "text": "MINSK, Belarus — Exit polls in Belarus late Sunday showed autocrat Alexander Lukashenko taking 87.6 percent of the vote in a presidential race denounced by the European Union as a “sham” and the country’s opposition-in-exile as a “non-election.”The polls, broadcast on state television, suggested Lukashenko, the 70-year-old former collective farmer who has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for more than 30 years, would win a seventh term.Lukashenko said he was “too busy” to even campaign, but no matter: He ran virtually unopposed. One of the five candidates allowed to challenge him, the Communist Party’s Sergei Syrankov, said he would be running “together with” Lukashenko, not against him. Another, Alexander Khizhnyak, called Lukashenko “the right choice.”Lukashenko, meeting with foreign journalists in a four-hour news conference Sunday, said Belarusians didn’t “need a show.”“An election is a serious thing,” he said. “Serious things should be made seriously. Why should we walk all over the place, shout at the top of our lungs, and hold rallies?” He was alluding to mass pro-democracy protests in 2020 that nearly toppled him.Lukashenko declined to say whether this would be his final five-year term as president. He said he was “not about to die,” and had no specific successor in mind.The Belarusian constitution requires periodic elections. When the country was part of the Soviet Union, candidates would regularly receive 99 percent of the vote.“What in the democratic world you call elections has nothing in common with this event in Belarus,” Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the exiled opposition leader who was recognized in the West as the true victor in Belarus’s 2020 elections, said last week. “It’s like a ritual for dictators reappointing themselves.”Tikhanovskaya, who was in Davos, Switzerland, and others in civil society warn that the world should be paying attention not to the election, but to Belarus’s role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Lukashenko’s close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.“If we had won the elections in 2020, there most likely wouldn’t have been an invasion of Ukraine,” Franak Viacorka, Tikhanovskaya’s chief adviser, said in a phone interview. “There can be no stability in Europe without stability in Belarus.”Lukashenko said Sunday he had “no regrets” about allowing his “older brother” Putin to use the country as a staging ground for the invasion.In the absence of a legitimate vote, activists have proposed holding online elections between Lukashenko and the meme coin BelDoge, a digital canine. Activists hoped a sizable win for BelDoge would embarrass Lukashenko and undermine the official vote.“These elections are like a military operation,” Viacorka said. “Lukashenko wants them to be as sterile, as silent and as quick as possible. He is afraid of unexpected things happening — and 2020 was a huge surprise.”Save for electoral billboards around town, the vote Sunday appeared to cause little stir in Minsk. Dmitry, a cabdriver, told The Washington Post that he “wasn’t following” the elections and that Belarusians had grown “used to” a predictable outcome. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of possible repercussions by authorities.At one voting station, a Post reporter encountered dozens of nervous-looking observers, electoral officials and police apparently taken aback by the rare visit from a foreign journalist. The country rarely accredits foreign media. Few if any voters were present.The election Sunday came five years after pro-democracy protests swept Belarus, drawing hundreds of thousands onto the streets. At one point, Lukashenko was seen in full riot gear and brandishing a rifle in a helicopter flying over rallies in which thousands demanded his resignation.Faced with extreme police violence and the detention of more than 35,000 people, the protest movement was smothered, and its leaders were imprisoned or exiled. More than 300,000 people have since fled this country of 9 million, according to the United Nations, including many from the promising IT sector. At least 1,250 people are being held as political prisoners, according to rights groups, including Nobel Peace laureate Ales Bialiatski.The Belarusian Foreign Ministry hit back last week at the European Parliament’s declaration that the election was a “sham.”Foreign Minister Maxim Ryzhenkov called the E.U. resolution to reject the election a “gross interference in the electoral processes of a sovereign state, that has nothing to do with the real state of affairs and is intended to put pressure on the free expression of the will of citizens.”Lukashenko said Sunday he “didn’t care” whether the West recognized the election results.Betraying even a flicker of dissent can have tragic consequences in today’s Belarus. People are commonly jailed for a like or comment on social media, or for following what the state calls “extremist” channels on the social media app Telegram. Some have been “forcibly disappeared,” without any communication with lawyers or family.Two of the most prominent opposition figures, Viktor Babariko and Maria Kalesnikava, were seen for the first time in two years after authorities allowed long-requested legal access; they had been isolated from the outside world for so long that many feared they were dead.“It’s a very sad context that these elections are being held in,” Pavel Sapelka, a member of the board of the Viasna Human Rights Center, said in a phone interview. “All civil society institutions have been destroyed, and there is not a single opposition party in the country; they have all been liquidated.”After pleas from Noble laureates and pressure from the Polish government and Belarusian activist groups, Lukashenko has released 250 political prisoners in recent months.This was a rare moment of joy for the pro-democracy opposition, which has been incapacitated by repression and cut off from any real influence over domestic political processes.Independent media have been barred from covering the election, while electoral law has been tightened to prevent candidates who have lived abroad recently from running. Tikhanovskaya has said publicly that now is not the moment to call for protests, instead recommending that supporters choose the “against all” option on the ballot papers.Reliant on social media and struggling to reach ordinary Belarusians, members of the opposition in exile are hoping for a “black swan” event — something that will cause the exit of Lukashenko and his omnipotent security service, still known by its Soviet-era initials, KGB.“Lukashenko is well aware of the risk of a seemingly stable regime suddenly losing all power,” independent Belarusian political analyst Dmitry Bolkunets said in an interview, drawing on the recent example of the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria. “This is why he continues widespread repression as he cannot regain the trust of the people in any other way — he is deeply troubled by any form of public activity.”What is Russia’s role?The president’s political survival has relied heavily on Putin. In recent years, Lukashenko has converted Belarus into essentially a Russian protectorate. Belarus served as a staging ground for Russian troops invading Ukraine from the north in 2022, and Minsk has acquiesced on plans to host Russian tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory, including Russia’s latest Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile.The entire Belarusian economy is financially dependent on subsidies from Moscow; two-thirds of Belarusian trade is with Russia, and Moscow has buttressed a weakened Belarusian economy against sanctions, enabling it to stabilize and even grow. Even the Belarusian national identity and language have been gradually marginalized, in favor of Russian, as Putin and Lukashenko seek to strengthen “historical” imperial ties.Belarus’s reliance on Russia is likely to only grow, in part because of the impact of international sanctions on Minsk and Belarus’s growing isolation. Many warn that this relationship will only fuel escalation and instability in the region.“Regrettably, the current situation in Belarus remains critical,” Bolkunets said. “In its current state, Belarus is increasingly being absorbed by Russia — informationally, economically and politically. This poses a significant challenge and threat to the security of the European continent.”",
