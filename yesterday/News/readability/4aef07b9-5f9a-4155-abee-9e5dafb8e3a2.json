  "text": "Hamas released three Israeli hostages from Gaza on Saturday, in the fifth exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel under the ceasefire deal.Eli Sharabi, Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy were freed from Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. In return, Israel released 183 Palestinian prisoners on Saturday.The condition of the three hostages, who appeared thin and gaunt as they were forced to speak on stage during their release, sparked outrage from Israeli politicians. “This is what a crime against humanity looks like!” said Israeli President Isaac Herzog in a statement.Thirteen other Israeli hostages have been released since the Gaza ceasefire and exchange deal began in January, in exchange for more than 500 Palestinian detainees. Five Thai hostages have also been released outside of the deal.Of the 251 people taken captive during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, 39 hostages are still believed to be alive and held in Gaza. Israel has said that eight hostages who were due to be released in the first phase of the ceasefire deal were dead, but did not release their names or details of whether they were among those taken captive during the October 2023 attack.Here’s what to know about the released Israeli hostages.(All ages correct at time of the hostages’ release.)Romi Gonen, 24Return to menuGonen, a keen dancer and choreographer, was attending the Nova music festival in southern Israel when Palestinian militants attacked the event and kidnapped her as she tried to escape, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.She was one of the first hostages to be released, alongside Emily Damari and Doron Steinbrecher, on Jan. 19.Gonen’s mother, Meirav Leshem Gonen, posted on Facebook that she was taking “a moment to breathe it in and believe in the reality” of her daughter’s release.Emily Damari, 28Return to menuDamari was kidnapped from her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza in southern Israel when Hamas militants stormed across the Israeli border. She is a dual citizen of Israel and Britain.Damari’s family previously confirmed, via the hostages forum, that she lost two fingers on the day of her abduction after being shot at by members of Hamas. Her mother, Mandy, said she heard from hostages who were freed last year that her daughter was alive, and she received one sign of her daughter’s life — but then, nothing.“Yesterday, I was finally able to give Emily the hug that I have been dreaming of,” her mother said in a statement the day after her release.Emily Damari posted on Instagram that she was “the happiest person in the world” and had “returned to my beloved life,” according to the Times of Israel.Doron Steinbrecher, 31Return to menuSteinbrecher, a veterinary nurse with dual Romanian-Israeli citizenship, was taken from her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza. That day, she had called her mother, Simona, and said she was hiding under her bed because someone had broken into her room, her mother said in an editorial for the Financial Times.“Ten minutes later, she sent a voice message to her friends — a message that said only one thing: ‘They’ve got me, they’ve got me,’” her mother wrote.On Jan. 19, Steinbrecher’s family said in a statement: “After an unbearable 471 days, our beloved Dodo has finally returned to our arms.”“My return home doesn’t mean those still there shouldn’t return — everyone must come back,” Doron said in a statement passed along by her sister at a media event where hostages’ families spoke.Liri Albag, 19Return to menuAlbag, an Israeli soldier, was taken from her base in Nahal Oz.She was one of five female soldiers to appear in a video released in May 2024, alongside Karina Ariev, Agam Berger, Daniella Gilboa and Naama Levy. Her sister, Shai Albag, said she did not recognize Albag’s face the first time she watched the footage. “So much fear in her eyes,” Shai said.She and Ariev, Gilboa and Levy were released on Jan. 25.“Finally, we’ve been able to see Liri, embrace her, and know she’s with us, safe, surrounded by the love of her family,” Albag’s family said in a statement. “Liri demonstrated superhuman strength and survived hell, and we are so proud of her steadfast endurance under impossible conditions.”Karina Ariev, 20Return to menuAriev, an Israeli soldier from Jerusalem, was also taken from the base in Nahal Oz during the Hamas attack.According to the hostages forum, Ariev “loves to bring joy to people in many ways — she cooks, sings, dances, and writes songs,” and before her abduction was debating between pursuing careers in beauty and makeup or mental health therapy.“Our hearts are filled with immense gratitude and joy,” her family wrote in a statement following her release. “After 477 tumultuous days of pain, worry, and endless anxiety — we finally got to embrace our beloved Karina, hear her voice, and see her smile that once again fills us with light.”Daniella Gilboa, 20Return to menuIsrael Defense Forces soldier Gilboa was also taken from the Nahal Oz army base.Her mother, Orly Gilboa, previously told ITV News that her eldest daughter has a “good heart” and is a talented singer, songwriter and piano player. Her father, Ran Gilboa, described his daughter as “strong and always supportive of others” in an interview with Jewish News.“I believe she is strengthening her friends who are also held hostage in Gaza. She can manage in every place,” he said in July.Gilboa’s family said in a statement that she “has finally returned to our family’s embrace. How we’ve prayed for this moment!”Naama Levy, 20Return to menuLevy was another of the IDF soldiers taken from the Nahal Oz base. In video taken after her capture, she was seen with blood on her face as she told her captors: “I have friends in Palestine.”The second of four children, Levy was raised in India, where she was educated in an American school, according to a website her family created to appeal for her release. She had previously taken part in a peace initiative including Americans, Israelis and Palestinians and dreamed of being a diplomat.“We are overjoyed and moved to see Naama standing strong and returning to us,” her family said in a statement after her release, adding: “We will not rest until the last hostage returns.”Agam Berger, 20Return to menuIDF soldier Berger, then 19, had been stationed at the Nahal Oz base for two days when she was captured on Oct. 7, 2023. She was one of three Israelis released on Jan. 30, alongside civilians Arbel Yehud and Gadi Moshe Moses.The violinist, who has a twin sister and two younger brothers, is passionate about music and volunteered with at-risk youths, according to the hostages forum.“Thank God we have reached this moment, and our hero Agam has returned to us after 482 days in enemy hands,” her family said in a statement. “Our daughter is strong, faithful, and brave.”Arbel Yehud, 29Return to menuYehud, 29, was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, where her family has lived for three generations. She has “a deep love for people and nature,” the hostages forum said, and “is known in her community as a devoted aunt, often seen spending time with her nephews around the kibbutz.”According to the forum, Yehud and her partner, Ariel Cunio, 27, got engaged shortly before the Hamas attack. Cunio and his brother David were also abducted and are still believed to be alive in Gaza.Her brother Dolev was initially believed to have been taken hostage, but his remains were later recovered inside Israel, according to the Israeli military. His wife, Sigal, gave birth to their fourth child nine days after the attack, according to the forum.Gadi Moshe Moses, 80Return to menuThe hostages forum described Moses, an agronomist and farmer, as “an amazing grandfather who loves his grandchildren very much.”He was at his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz when the Oct. 7, 2023, attack began; his partner, Efrat Katz, was killed, while her daughter and two grandchildren were taken hostage and later released in November 2023, as part of the first Israel-Hamas ceasefire-and-hostage-release deal, according to Israeli media reports. Moses’s ex-wife was also taken hostage and released in November, per Israeli media.Passionate about agricultural education, Moses “can listen and talk for hours with anyone who comes to trainings at the kibbutz,” the forum said, adding: “The children, grandchildren, and Gadi’s garden are waiting for him.”Keith Siegel, 65Return to menuFather of four Keith Siegel was raised in North Carolina and immigrated to Israel as a young man.He worked on a kibbutz cultivating cotton and wheat and became a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen. He later settled in Kibbutz Kfar Aza with his wife Aviva and worked in a pharmaceutical company while Aviva worked in a preschool.Both were kidnapped from their home during the Oct. 7 attack. Aviva was released in November 2023, along with dozens of women and children, during a brief ceasefire deal. The couple were moved 13 times in their initial weeks of captivity, between tunnels and apartments. When Aviva was released, she urged Keith to stay strong as he lay on a grimy mattress in a Gaza apartment, his hand wounded by a bullet.Keith was next seen in a Hamas video released in April 2024. In December, his mother died in North Carolina aged 97, unaware that her son was in captivity as her family had shielded her from the reality due to her dementia, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported.After his release on Feb. 1, his family said in a statement: “Finally, after 484 long, terrifying days and nights, full of immense worry for our father, we can breathe again.”Yarden Bibas, 35Return to menuYarden Bibas was abducted alongside his wife, Shiri Bibas, and their two young children, Ariel and Kfir — then ages 4 years and 9 months, respectively — from Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7, 2023.A video filmed on Oct. 7 showed Shiri, terrified and clutching her children as they were abducted by gunmen. Her husband’s abduction was also filmed. Hamas later released a video of Yarden, in which he was forced to say his wife and children were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israeli authorities did not confirm their deaths, but said they were “very concerned” about their well-being.“I want to thank all the people, everyone who supported me and my family,” Bibas said in a statement Friday, after his release. “Sadly, my family hasn’t returned to me yet. They are still there. My light is still there, and as long as they’re there, everything here is dark. Thanks to you, I was brought back — help me bring the light back to my life.”Ofer Kalderon, 54Return to menuKalderon, who is a dual French-Israeli national, was taken hostage from Kibbutz Nir Oz along with his two children, who were released as part of the first ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in November 2023.Kalderon’s mother-in-law and niece were both killed on Oct. 7, his cousin Ifat Kalderon said. Writing in Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Ifat Kalderon described Ofer as “my dear, funny and loving cousin.” The Hostages and Missing Families Forum described him as a “family-oriented man, a father who lights up every room he enters” who loved mountain biking and flying model aircraft.His family said in a statement they were “overwhelmed with joy, relief, and emotion” after his return. “We are proud of his ability to survive and hold onto the hope of embracing his children again.”Eli Sharabi, 52Return to menuSharabi lived in Kibbutz Beeri with his British-born wife Lianne and their two daughters Noiya and Yahel, according to the hostages forum.He and his elder brother Yossi, who lived next door, were both taken into Gaza during the Hamas attack, while his wife and daughters were killed, the forum said.The Israeli military later said Yossi was probably killed when an Israeli strike hit a building adjacent to where he and two other hostages were being held, according to Israeli media reports. His body remains in Gaza.Ohad Ben Ami, 56Return to menuBen Ami, a father of three daughters, was abducted from Kibbutz Beeri alongside his wife Raz, who was released during a hostage exchange deal in November 2023.Ben Ami, who is the kibbutz’s accountant, “is known for his good judgment and sense of humor,” the hostages forum wrote. “A passionate nature enthusiast, Ohad is the cornerstone of his family.”Ben Ami’s daughters, Yulie, Ella and Natalie, spoke to him by phone while waiting to be reunited with their father on Saturday.“Our father has emerged from the horror, and you can see the trauma he endured written on his face,” they said in a statement. “But we are staying strong for him here, just as he stays strong for us, and soon we’ll be able to embrace him.”Or Levy, 34Return to menuLevy, a computer programmer at a start-up, and his wife Einav left their 2-year-old son Almog with family before going to the Nova music festival. Just 15 minutes after arriving, the Hamas attack began, according to the hostages forum.The couple tried to shelter in a concrete safe room, where Levy was wounded and taken hostage and his wife was killed, the forum said.“Mom, you don’t want to know what’s going on here,” he wrote in his last message before his abduction, according to his brother.Hamas released a video of Levy covered in blood, as he and other hostages were driven toward Gaza.“The look on his face — the last sign of life I have from my baby brother, shocked, heartbroken, and completely terrified — never leaves my mind,” his brother said, according to the forum.Abbie Cheeseman, Lior Soroka, Gerry Shih, Shira Rubin, Sammy Westfall and Miriam Berger contributed to this report.correctionA previous version of this article incorrectly said that Agam Berger was released from Khan Younis. She was released from Jabalya. The article has been corrected.Middle East conflict Israel’s Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Thursday he has instructed the military to draft a plan to “allow voluntary departure” of Gaza residents from the enclave. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel’s creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon. Israel’s airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel’s founding.Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century’s most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations’ ceasefire resolutions.",
