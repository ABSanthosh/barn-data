  "text": "US President Donald Trump (AP image) US President Donald Trump has urged his supporters and allies to stop attacking Attorney General Pam Bondi, saying she is doing an excellent job and should be allowed to focus on her work. In a lengthy post on Truth Social, Trump appealed for unity within the MAGA movement and criticized the renewed controversy over Jeffrey Epstein’s files, which has sparked deepening clashes between the FBI and the department of justice.\"Let Pam Bondi do her job — she's great!\" Trump wrote, making a direct plea as tensions reportedly rose within federal law enforcement. According to media reports, speculation has been growing that FBI director Kash Patel may be considering resigning from his post after much anticipation that FBI deputy director Dan Bongino may also step down amid the turmoil over handling of Epstein-related documents.Addressing his supporters directly, Trump questioned why so many were targeting Bondi despite her record. He called for Republicans to remain united instead of fighting among themselves. “What’s going on with my ‘boys’ and, in some cases, ‘gals?’ They’re all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a fantastic job! We’re on one Team, MAGA, and I don’t like what’s happening,” he wrote...Trump claimed that his administration is highly successful and well-regarded globally but argued that “selfish people” are undermining it by stirring up controversy about Epstein. He accused prominent political opponents including former US President Barack Obama, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, former FBI Director James Comey, former CIA director John Brennan and officials from the former US President Joe Biden administration of manufacturing the drama over the so-called “Epstein Files.”“For years, it’s Epstein, over and over again,” Trump said, suggesting the focus on Epstein is a political distraction. He questioned why, if any damaging evidence existed in the Epstein files, his opponents did not release it to hurt the MAGA movement. He also linked this controversy to past disputes over unreleased government records such as the John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr files.Trump further accused his rivals of using similar tactics in the past, pointing to the Steele Dossier and the “Russia Hoax,” and claimed his critics were trying to divide his supporters. He argued that despite his administration’s successes which included border security, deportations of criminals, economic growth, energy dominance and efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons some people are never satisfied.“No matter how much success we have had … it’s never enough for some people,” he wrote. He further added that he expects his administration to achieve more in six months than any other administration has in a century.Trump called on his allies to stay focused on what he described as key priorities: investigating voter fraud, political corruption, ActBlue, and what he continues to claim was a “rigged and stolen” 2020 election. He argued that Bondi’s work on these issues is vital and should not be disrupted by internal fighting or the renewed attention on Epstein.He concluded by urging his supporters to stop wasting time and energy on Epstein, whom he claimed “nobody cares about,” and to focus instead on what he described as the ongoing mission to save the country and make America great again.Epstein files controversy: Earlier, reports suggested that Patel is furious with Bondi’s handling of the Epstein files. He is said to be frustrated that Bondi has not unsealed more records related to the case and has told associates he wants her removed from her position.Patel has publicly stated that the FBI’s review of evidence showed that Epstein was not murdered, pushing back against conspiracy theories about Epstein’s 2019 death in jail.The controversy erupted after the FBI and DOJ issued a joint memo declaring the Epstein case officially closed, stating he died by suicide and there was no evidence of homicide. The announcement angered many MAGA commentators including FBI director Kash Patel and his deputy Dan Bongino who refuse to accept that there is no “client list” of powerful individuals who visited Epstein’s island or were involved in sex trafficking of minors.For years, Patel and Bongino have suggested there was more to be revealed about the Epstein case. Bondi herself previously claimed she had an Epstein “client list” on her desk for review. However, after the case was closed, Bondi clarified that she was referring to the broader set of Epstein-related documents, not a specific client list.",
