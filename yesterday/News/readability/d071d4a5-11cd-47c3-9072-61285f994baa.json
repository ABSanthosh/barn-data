  "text": "US President Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani (AP)US President Donald Trump on Wednesday called Indian-American politician Zohran Mamdani “a 100% communist lunatic” after he won the Democratic primary in New York City, Trump's former hometown.\"It’s finally happened, the Democrats have crossed the line. Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\"We’ve had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous,\" Trump wrote. \"He looks TERRIBLE, his voice is grating, he’s not very smart, he’s got AOC+3, Dummies ALL, backing him, and even our Great Palestinian Senator, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, is groveling over him. Yes, this is a big moment in the History of our Country!\" he added.The remark marks Trump's first public statement since Mamdani’s apparent win over former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary.Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish and has no Palestinian background, along with house minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, congratulated Mamdani on Wednesday morning and pledged to meet with the state legislator, though they did not offer an official endorsement.Republicans have sought to portray the 33-year-old democratic socialist as the symbol of the Democratic party, while prominent conservative activists have linked Mamdani to 9/11 in online attacks targeting his faith.In a follow-up post, Trump sarcastically gave an idea to Democrats to nominate representative Jasmine Crockett of Texas for president and representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York as her running mate.",
