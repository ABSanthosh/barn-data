  "text": "A new Royal Family book has claimed that Queen Elizabeth II was enraged after Harry and Meghan's daughter was named Lilibet as Lilibet was Elizabeth's childhood name when she could not pronounce Elizabeth. It later became one of the adorable names late Prince Philip used for his wife. Meghan Markle told that she was granted permission to use the name 'Lilibet' for their daughter.Harry too maintained that version but it enraged the Queen. Lilibet was born in June 2021, two years after Harry and Meghan left their royal duties and exited the family to settle in the US.Robert Hardman's book 'Charles III: New King, New Court. The Inside Story' revealed that one member of staff claimed that the late Queen was \"as angry as I'd ever seen her\" after hearing Harry and Meghan's comments. The Queen was never asked for her blessing to use the name Lilibet for Harry and Meghan's daughter, a BBC report said but some other reports claimed that when the Queen was contacted by Harry, she was not in a position to say no. The old issue resurfaced as Meghan Markle is on the radar for her growing distance with Prince Harry and speculations are rife that the royal couple may head for a divorce. On professional front too, Meghan is seeing a bad press after her former staff said she is a dictator in high heels. Harry is more focused on his solo charity engagements and Meghan her own. While work is separating them, according to insiders, they are already on a 'trial separation'. When the controversy over Lilibet's name broke out, a spokesperson of Harry and Meghan said they would not have used the name without the late monarch's permission. \"The Duke spoke with his family in advance of the announcement - in fact his grandmother was the first family member he called. During that conversation, he shared their hope of naming their daughter Lilibet in her honour. Had she not been supportive, they would not have used the name,\" it was said.Law firm Schillings - which acts for Harry and Meghan - wrote a letter to some news broadcasters and publishers stating that the claims that the pair had not asked the Queen for permission was incorrect and defamatory.",
