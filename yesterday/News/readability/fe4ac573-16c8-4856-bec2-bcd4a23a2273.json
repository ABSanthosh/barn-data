  "description": "A magnitude 5.7 earthquake rattled Tibet early Monday at a shallow depth of 10km, as reported by the National Center for Seismology. This follows a smaller 3.7 magnitude quake just days prior in the same region. Experts highlight the increased potential for destruction from shallow earthquakes due to stronger ground shaking in this seismically active zone.",

  "text": "A magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck Tibet in the early hours of Monday, according to National Center for Seismology (NCS). The tremor was recorded at a depth of just 10km.The NCS posted the seismic details on X, stating the quake occurred at 2:41am IST, with coordinates at latitude 29.02째N and longitude 87.48째E. Just days earlier, on May 8, the region experienced a smaller 3.7 magnitude quake at a similar depth.Experts warn that shallow earthquakes often have more severe effects, as energy is released closer to the surface, leading to stronger ground shaking and a higher potential for destruction.The Tibetan Plateau lies along a major fault line where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide, making the area highly prone to seismic activity.
