  "text": "In a report submitted to the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt Wednesday, the Constitution Reform Commission has recommended introducing a two-term limit on the PM's tenure. It also proposed reinstating the provision for a referendum to amend the constitution and introducing a bicameral parliament - a lower house (national assembly) and upper house (senate) - to ensure representation for all.Both houses will have terms of four years, meaning govt's and the PM's term will also be four years, the commission has suggested. It has recommended reforms to ensure that the PM can face a no-confidence motion in parliament.To prevent the concentration of power in the hands of an individual or institution, it has proposed the creation of a constitutional body - national constitutional council (NCC) - to establish a system of checks and balances between the three branches of the state and the two executive positions - PM and president.This council would include the president, chief justice, PM, leaders of opposition of both houses, speakers and deputy speakers from the opposition, and a representative of other parties. The commission has recommended decentralising the judiciary by maintaining the unitary structure of Supreme Court, while establishing permanent high court benches with jurisdiction in all divisional cities. It has also provided a framework for an interim govt to be formed after the dissolution of parliament, and recommended that selection of advisers to such govts should be solely the NCC's responsibility.",
