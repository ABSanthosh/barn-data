  "text": "Credit: @akku92 / XElectrical services on the Air India flight that crashed with 242 passengers onboard were not working hours beforehand, it has been claimed.A passenger on an earlier flight, named on social media as Akash Vatsa, posted videos showing facilities such as air-conditioning, service buttons and television touch screens not responding when he tried to operate them.He can be heard saying in the clip: “Nothing is working, nothing, not even the light.”Mr Vatsa claimed on social media to be on the same Air India Dreamliner, flying from Delhi to Ahmedabad on Thursday morning, that went on to crash hours later in the Gujarat city as it departed for London.The video showed the same aircraft call sign – VT-ANB – on the side of the aircraft, which corresponded with that of the Ahmedabad to Gatwick flight which went down on Thursday at around 1.30pm local time.Akash Vatsa’s video showed the VT-ANB call sign of the crashed jet on the side of the aircraft he was boarding - x.com/akku92He also posted a picture of his boarding pass, which also corresponded with the time and date.Hours later, and just moments after departing from Ahmedabad international airport, the same Boeing 787-8 plummeted into a hostel housing medical students at the BJ Medical College.The plane was carrying 242 people, including 53 Britons, and left only one known survivor. Several people were also killed on the ground.Mr Vatsa also posted a picture of his boarding pass, which also corresponded with the time and date - x.com/akku92The cause of the crash has not yet been determined, but footage showed the plane rapidly descending into a residential area of the city moments after it took off, prompting chaotic scenes on the ground and a huge emergency service response.Multiple theories of how the crash occurred have been circulated, and late whistleblower John Barnett had raised a string of safety concerns about the same type of plane involved in Thursday’s crash before his death in March 2024.No Boeing 787’s had been involved in fatal accidents before Thursday, and there is no evidence Boeing is to blame.Boeing has always insisted the aircraft were built to the highest levels of safety and quality and insisted the concerns brought forward by John Barnett “did not affect airplane safety”.Lt. Col. John R Davidson, former US Air force pilot and aviation safety expert said, “There are a number of possible scenarios: thrust or engine or performance issues, excessive aircraft weight, poor trim or flap configuration, or a more critical failure that affected the aircraft’s ability to climb.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.
