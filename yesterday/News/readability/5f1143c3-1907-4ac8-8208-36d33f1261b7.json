But people stormed in and found Mr. Abdo, 22, in the kitchen. They stabbed him before dragging him outside, even as his sister, Marwa, clung to him. There, he was shot.The account, shared by Mr. Abdo’s family, was confirmed by local police in the northwestern city of Idlib. Video footage widely shared on Syrian social media and verified by The New York Times captured the gruesome scene that followed: As Ms. Abdo gripped his lifeless body, neighbors continued to kick him. She begged them to stop, saying he was already dead.“This is your fate,” one man yelled. Other verified video footage shows a crowd shouting expletives after Mr. Abdo’s body was tied by the neck to a car and dragged through the streets. It is not clear who filmed the video.Ms. Abdo recalled those moments in an interview with The Times four days later. She vowed revenge, a sign of the growing threat of a cycle of violent retribution in a new Syria.ImageThe Abdo family’s ground floor apartment, from which Bashar Abdo was dragged, beaten and eventually shot.
