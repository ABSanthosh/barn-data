Problems were also reported with tabulation machines in Bedford County. “The Cambria County Board of Election learned early this morning that a software malfunction in the County’s Electronic Voting System has prevented voters from scanning their ballots,” Cambria County Solicitor Ron Repak said in a statement.“This should not discourage voters from voting at their voting precincts. The Board has filed a Court Order extending the time to vote within Cambria County.” Cambria County, which is about 65 miles east of Pittsburgh, has a population of 131,000; Bedford, next door, has about 47,000 residents.Also See:US Election Results 2024 | US Senate Elections 2024 | Indian Americans US Election 2024",
