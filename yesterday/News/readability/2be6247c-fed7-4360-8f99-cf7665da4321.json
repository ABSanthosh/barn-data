  "text": "A 20-year-old American citizen from Tampa was beaten to death Friday while visiting family in the West Bank, according to relatives who spoke with The Washington Post.Sayfollah Kamel Musallet’s relatives and the Palestinian Health Ministry said Musallet was fatally beaten by Israeli settlers in the town of Sinjil, north of Ramallah. The Israel Defense Forces said it was looking into reports of a death during a confrontation between Palestinians and Israelis in the area.Musallet was born and grew up in Port Charlotte, Florida, said his father, Kamel Musallet, and was working with his father at an ice cream and dessert shop in Tampa that they had recently opened. He was “known to be just such an honorable and loving and genuine guy,” said his second cousin Fatmah Muhammad in New York.Musallet was a U.S. citizen, both his father and second cousin told The Post in phone interviews. The State Department said it was aware of reports of a U.S. citizen’s death in the West Bank but did not comment on Musallet specifically.Musallet traveled to the West Bank in June to visit family in al-Mazra’a ash-Sharqiya, a village in the West Bank northeast of Ramallah, his two relatives said.“He was raised in Florida. He was a great citizen, a great friend, sibling, son — this is just horrific,” said Muhammad. “He always was full of smiles — just an honest, caring person.”“He was a beautiful and loving son — a beautiful soul,” said his father, who spoke to The Post from Orlando.Musallet was “just starting the prime of his life” and was known as a “kind, hard-working, and deeply-respected young man,” his father said in a statement, noting that his son was nicknamed “Saif.”“This is an unimaginable nightmare and injustice that no family should ever have to face,” he added. “We demand the U.S. State Department lead an immediate investigation and hold the Israeli settlers who killed Saif accountable for their crimes. We demand justice.”In April, a Palestinian American 14-year-old, Amer Rabee, was shot dead in the West Bank by Israeli forces. Last year, two Palestinian American 17-year-olds, Tawfic Abdel Jabbar and Mohammad Ahmad Alkhdour, were killed in the West Bank in cases involving Israeli forces and settlers.Kamel Musallet told The Post he thinks that “nobody does anything” about the violence against American citizens in the West Bank. “It’s just another name, another number,” he said.Miriam Berger contributed to this report.",
