  "text": "About 2 billion Muslims around the world celebrated Eid al-Fitr on Sunday, marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan, when adherents fast from dawn until dusk.In festive, colorful celebrations, families and friends from Morocco to Nigeria, Sudan to Albania, and Gaza to India gathered for shared feasts, exchanged gifts, attended communal prayers and spent time with their loved ones.During the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims abstain from eating and drinking during daylight hours, beginning their fast after a pre-sunrise meal and breaking it with iftar, a dinner at sunset. It’s usually a time for reflection and deeper connection to faith and community.Ramadan officially ends when a new crescent moon is sighted, marking the beginning of the month of Shawwal, which happened Saturday.In the Gaza Strip, about 2 million Palestinian Muslims observed the end of Ramadan with muted commemorations after Israel’s recent resumption of military operations in the enclave, breaking the relative calm of a two-month ceasefire.Some Gazans visited the graves of relatives, while others prayed on carpets splayed atop rubble or near destroyed mosques.“It’s the Eid of sadness,” Adel al-Shaer in Deir al-Balah told the Associated Press.In Sudan, Muslims marked another Eid under the shadow of civil war, a conflict between the country’s army and a rival paramilitary force that has killed more than 150,000 people in nearly two years, according to some estimates.Many people — including in Indonesia, where the tradition is called “mudik” — hopped onto trains, buses and boats to flee towns and cities and return home to celebrate the holiday with family.In some countries, it’s traditional for elders to give money to younger family members. Some serve traditional meals such as lemang, a Southeast Asian dish of glutinous rice cooked in coconut milk, or sweets like kahk — crumbly, sugarcoated cookies eaten widely in Egypt.Eid prayers are offered in the morning, often in open spaces. In the holy city of Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, hundreds of thousands of Muslims prayed Sunday at the Grand Mosque.",
