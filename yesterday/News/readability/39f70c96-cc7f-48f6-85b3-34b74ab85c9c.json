  "text": "The U.N. special envoy to Syria on Wednesday gave one of his first signs of optimism about Syria’s new government as the de facto leaders, the Islamist rebel group Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, work to attain international legitimacy and restore a sense of security to Syrians.“I think it’s important to say that there is a lot of hope that we can now see the beginning of a new Syria,” Geir O. Pedersen told reporters in the Syrian capital, Damascus.Live coverage contributors 8CIA Director William Burns arrives in Qatar for ceasefire deal talksReturn to menuCIA Director William J. Burns arrived in Qatar on Wednesday for talks with Qatari officials on the status of negotiations over a ceasefire and hostage release in the Israel-Gaza war, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details.After earlier reports of an imminent deal, both U.S. and Israeli officials have tamped down on the possibility of an agreement this week. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told MSNBC on Wednesday: “We’ve been close before, we’ve expressed optimism, we’ve gotten close to the finish line. So we are wary of making predictions or promises. But this is close. … We can get it done.”Sullivan said remaining obstacles include the names of hostages to be released by Hamas in the first phase of the three-phase ceasefire proposal brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, as well as “some specific details about the disposition of Israeli forces during the ceasefire.” He said he believed that Israel, where he visited last week, is prepared to move forward. “The big-picture question is, is Hamas prepared to finally say, ‘Yes, let’s do it,’” Sullivan said.A former Egyptian official close to the negotiations said Israel has rejected the release of Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti — first demanded by Hamas earlier this year — in the exchange of Israeli-held prisoners for hostages.The former official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the sensitive talks, said Israel has also rejected Hamas’s demand that Gazans be allowed to return to northern Gaza, where the Israel Defense Forces have continued major military operations and refused the entry of Gazans.In a letter sent to Israeli ministers in August, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called on Israel to act within 30 days on a list of demands, including “reaffirming that there will be no Israeli government policy of forced evacuation of civilians from northern to southern Gaza.” Israel responded that there had been no forced evacuation of the hundreds of thousands of Gazans who have left the north, saying they had been advised of military operations and had chosen to leave.Kamal Adwan hospital ICU in Gaza targeted in strikes, director saysReturn to menuFire raged through the rubble after a strike hit a building just outside Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia, Gaza on Dec. 17. (Video: Obtained by Reuters)Israeli strikes on one of the last functioning medical facilities in northern Gaza and nearby buildings on Tuesday killed at least eight people and left the intensive care unit inoperative, Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, said Wednesday.In a statement, Abu Safiya said that people staggered out of the targeted buildings “with their bodies on fire” and that children remained trapped under the rubble. Tanks fired directly at the hospital “from all sides,” he added, setting the only intensive care unit in northern Gaza ablaze.“Yesterday was one of the darkest, most difficult and bloodiest days at Kamal Adwan Hospital,” Abu Safiya said.The facility is one of the last working hospitals in northern Gaza, where Israeli forces have for several months been carrying out an offensive that they claim is to prevent Hamas fighters from regrouping. The facility has come under attack before.The military assault has effectively sealed northern Gaza off from aid workers. The United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs reported last week that aid to the area had been “largely blocked” for 66 days.The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Abu Safiya said health-care workers evacuated patients and then put the fire out using blankets and their own hands. There were no fire extinguishers available, he said, and the hospital’s water supply was cut off.“The scene inside the intensive care unit was like a war zone,” Abu Safiya said, “with bullets penetrating equipment, walls and windows. It is incomprehensible why we are being targeted in this brutal way.”The World Health Organization said Monday that four missions to Kamal Adwan had been “arbitrarily denied” in the past week. A team reached the hospital in recent days to deliver food, fuel and medicine, but the facility remains without specialized personnel for surgical and maternal care.“Hostilities around the hospital continue and recent attacks have further damaged the oxygen supply, generators and broken windows and doors of the patients’ rooms,” the World Health Organization said Monday. “The conditions in the hospital are simply appalling.”HTS leader meets with German delegation in latest outreach to the WestReturn to menuBERLIN — Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham’s leadership held talks with a German delegation, the rebel group and the German Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday, in the Islamist rebel group’s latest outreach to Western officials after toppling Bashar al-Assad’s regime less than two weeks ago.The German delegation, led by Tobias Tunkel, met with HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani; Zaid al-Attar, the HTS representative responsible for international contacts; and Nadir al-Qadari, the education minister of the HTS-appointed transitional government, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to The Washington Post Wednesday.The talks focused on the Syrian political transition and Germany’s expectation for an inclusive government, the ministry said. The delegation also met with representatives of civil society and religious communities, and inspected the German Embassy in Damascus, the ministry said.Since taking power in Syria, Sharaa has worked to distance his organization from its militant roots and forge new connections with other countries in a bid for international legitimacy. HTS, a former al-Qaeda affiliate, remains on the United States’ and European Union’s list of terrorist organization.The Biden administration has been in direct contact with HTS, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday. France on Tuesday raised its flag over its Damascus embassy for the first time in 12 years, as Western officials prepare to engage with Syria’s new leaders.Sharaa also met with a British government delegation, HTS said Monday, and E.U. foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Tuesday that the bloc will reopen its delegation in Syria, Reuters reported.“Syria must not become a plaything of foreign powers or an experiment of radical forces,” the German Foreign Ministry said in the Wednesday statement. “We know where HTS comes from and know its origins in the Al-Qaeda ideology. We are closely monitoring the activities of HTS and the HTS-appointed transitional government. As far as one can tell, they have acted cautiously so far. Like our international partners, we will judge them by their actions. Any cooperation requires that ethnic and religious minorities are protected and women’s rights are respected.”Ho reported from London.Palestinians sue Blinken over U.S. support of Israeli militaryReturn to menuFive Palestinians and Palestinian Americans filed a lawsuit accusing Secretary of State Antony Blinken of deliberately circumventing U.S. human rights law by providing military aid to Israel amid its war in Gaza.The plaintiffs alleged in their suit, filed Tuesday in a D.C. federal court, that Washington’s continued support of the Israeli military violated the Leahy Laws, which prohibit providing U.S. military assistance to individuals or security force units that commit gross violations of human rights with impunity.Under the Leahy Laws, the State Department is required to vet the units designated to receive assistance. According to the lawsuit, the State Department limited its vetting of Israel to units nominated to receive training assistance, and not those set to receive U.S. equipment or weapons — “leaving most Israeli units receiving assistance unpoliced,” the suit said.The State Department declined to comment on the suit Wednesday.The plaintiffs include three Palestinian Americans whose family members have been killed and displaced by Israeli military activity in Gaza; Amal Gaza, a pseudonym for a mathematics teacher from Gaza who has had 20 family members killed in the war; and Shawan Jabarin, the director of the Palestinian human rights group al-Haq in the West Bank.The lawsuit said that if Blinken had properly enforced the Leahy Laws, “the ability of Israeli security force units to commit GVHRs [gross violations of human rights] in Gaza and the West Bank would be materially diminished because of the loss of U.S. assistance.”In January, lawyers for South Africa argued before the International Court of Justice that Israel’s actions, including its bombardment and siege of Gaza, showed its intent to commit genocide against Palestinians. Earlier this month, Amnesty International said that Israel is committing acts of genocide in Gaza.The United States has long been Israel’s largest provider of military support. In June, The Washington Post reported that the amount of security assistance that the United States had provided to Israel since Oct. 7, 2023, hit $6.5 billion, with some estimates putting the total higher.Syria’s collapse and Israeli attacks leave Iran exposed Return to menuA week of punishing Israeli airstrikes on Syria after the fall of Bashar al-Assad didn’t just set Syria’s own military back years, experts said, but also peeled away another layer of Iranian defenses in the region, leaving Tehran more exposed than it has been in decades.Iran’s growing vulnerability has generated alarm within the government, stirring fears that its steadily escalating conflict with Israel could soon enter a more dangerous phase. Hard-line supporters of the regime are talking more publicly, and more frequently, about adopting nuclear deterrence to thwart a possible Israeli attack. And among the country’s beleaguered opposition, there is new hope that the crumbling of Iranian power abroad could lead to a loosening of authoritarian rule at home.“The fingers of the Islamic Republic are being cut off and are getting weaker,” one activist from Iran’s Baluchistan region said by phone, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.After Assad’s ouster by Islamist rebels — preceded by the abrupt departure of Iranian advisers and the withdrawal of allied regional forces — Israel took advantage of the power vacuum to destroy vast amounts of Syrian military infrastructure. Hundreds of strikes destroyed warplanes, helicopters, weapons caches and the bulk of the country’s navy.This is an excerpt from a full story.Monitoring the status of hostages still in Gaza after Hamas’s attackAssad defends escape from Syria, blames ‘terrorist onslaught’ in first statementWar’s ebb in Lebanon leaves devastation and uncertain future",
