  "text": "A massive military parade to mark the 250th anniversary of the US Army, coinciding with US President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday on June 14, is expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million, according to Army officials.As per CBS News, the event is expected to feature more than 100 vehicles, including M1 Abrams tanks, Stryker and Bradley fighting vehicles, and artillery units like Howitzers. It could also involve up to 50 helicopters, requiring “extensive coordination” with the Federal Aviation Administration. The day will conclude with a fireworks display and live performances.Lt Col Ruth Castro, an Army spokesperson, confirmed that around 6,600 to 7,500 soldiers will participate,according to CNBC.Many will arrive days ahead and be housed in federal buildings such as the department of agriculture and a general services administration warehouse in Washington, DC. Soldiers will receive one hot meal, two ready-to-eat meals daily, and $50 in extra pay.The celebration, which includes period uniforms and vintage aircraft flyovers from World War II-era B-17s and P-51 Mustangs, will run from Arlington, Virginia, to the National Mall. The Independent reported that the Army is still struggling to source accurate historical uniforms from the War of 1812 and the Spanish-American War.Trump said, “We’re going to have a big, beautiful parade.” He insisted the event is not tied to his birthday and brushed off concerns over the cost: “It would be peanuts compared to the value of doing it.”As per media reports, the US president’s fascination with military parades likely began after he attended France’s Bastille Day celebrations in 2017, when he said, \"we're going to have to try and top it\". Although he had attempted to organize a similar event in 2018, he cancelled it after the cost was projected at $92 million. He later blamed “local politicians who run Washington, DC, poorly” for inflating the price, as per CBS News.The National Park Service has received permit requests for both the parade and a planned counterprotest. According to The Independent, one application calls the parade “an insult to the American people,” and estimates up to 20,000 demonstrators might attend.Democratic critics, including Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee, have slammed the plan as wasteful. “The egotist-in-chief wants taxpayers to foot the bill for a military parade on his birthday,” Cohen said in a statement.Despite opposition, the event is set to be the grand finale of a weeklong commemoration, with concerts, parachute jumps, military demonstrations, and musical performances, including country music stars, reported The Independent. Fireworks are scheduled for 9:45 pm (local time) on the National Mall.",
