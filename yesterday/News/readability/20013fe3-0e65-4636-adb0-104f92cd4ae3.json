  "text": "Trump slams Netanyahu trial as ‘witch hunt’; warns of stalled Hamas, Iran talksUS President Donald Trump has lashed out at Israeli prosecutors for what he describes as a “POLITICAL WITCH HUNT” against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Trump in his recent post on Truth Social defended Netanyahu, describing him as a \"War Hero\" and praising his leadership, especially in working closely with the US to counter Iran’s nuclear ambitions. He credited Netanyahu with playing a key role in what he called a \"Great Success\" in curbing Iran's nuclear threat. “It is terrible what they are doing in Israel to Bibi Netanyahu. He is a War Hero, and a Prime Minister who did a fabulous job working with the United States to bring Great Success in getting rid of the dangerous Nuclear threat in Iran.”, Trump wrote.Highlighting the Israeli leader’s current diplomatic efforts, Trump emphasized that Netanyahu is in the middle of crucial negotiations with Hamas aimed at securing the release of hostages. He questioned how someone in such a high-stakes position could be expected to \"sit in a Courtroom all day long\" over what he described as trivial matters—mockingly referencing items like “Cigars” and even a “Bugs Bunny Doll” to downplay the severity of the charges.He ended his statement with a rallying cry of support for Netanyahu:“We just had a Great Victory with Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu at the helm — And this greatly tarnishes our Victory. LET BIBI GO, HE’S GOT A BIG JOB TO DO!”This isn’t the first time Trump has criticized Netanyahu’s trial. Just last week, he made a similar statement following the implementation of the ceasefire between Israel and Iran.Why is Netanyahu facing courtroom trial ?Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is currently facing several corruption charges, first filed in 2019, including bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. In the first case, Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, are accused of accepting over $260,000 in luxury items—such as cigars, champagne, and jewelry—from wealthy businessmen in return for political favors. The two remaining cases claim he sought to secure more favorable media coverage from prominent Israeli news outlets.If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison. Since the trial began in May 2020, it has seen numerous delays, many of which were requested by Netanyahu himself—initially citing the conflict in Gaza, followed by the escalation in Lebanon.Also read | 'Let Bibi go': Trump slams Netanyahu trial as ‘witch hunt’; warns of stalled Hamas, Iran talks",
