  "text": "Ten people, many of them children, were killed in a strike at a water distribution site in central Gaza on Sunday, local health officials said, in a deadly incident the Israeli military said was the result of a “technical error” with a munition.“Thirsty children, searching for water to quench their thirst. They returned to their homes as lifeless corpses,” said Ramadan Nassar, a witness who lives in the Nuseirat area.The Israel Defense Forces said it launched “a strike targeting an Islamic Jihad terrorist” on Sunday, but that “as a result of a technical error with the munition, the munition fell dozens of meters from the target.”The Israeli military said it was “aware of the claim regarding casualties” and is investigating the incident. “The IDF regrets any harm to uninvolved civilians.”Nassar said a munition landed close to where children were lining up to fill water containers. People had been waiting since the morning “due to the scarcity of water in the area,” he said. It was “a difficult and bloody scene,” Nassar said.He shared a video of what he said was the scene immediately after the strike, showing people pulling limp bodies by their arms from underneath rubble, injured children crying out, and several lifeless bodies lying on the ground covered in blood. People carried injured children in their arms; another used a bicycle to carry a child who was not moving and had blood flowing from his head.“As I document … my eyes in the camera lens, my heart breaking behind it. In front of me, everyone is on the ground, faces covered in dust, lost gazes, little bodies trembling and then falling,” Nassar wrote in a WhatsApp message to The Washington Post after the incident. “It’s like I’m recording the end of the world, frame by frame.”The location of the video could not immediately be independently verified. Photographs published by wire agencies showed crowds weeping and crying over a child’s body in Nuseirat, in central Gaza. In one photo, a man appears to close a boy’s eyelids; in another, a young boy hugs the body of his friend.Marwan Abu Nasser, director of al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat, told The Post that the hospital received the bodies of 10 people after the strike, mostly children. Raafat Ali al-Majdalawi, director of the al-Awda Health and Community Association, told local media that six children were killed and 16 others were injured.The strike at a water distribution site comes as the United Nations again warned of increased malnutrition in Gaza. Food shortages in Gaza “are pushing children to the brink,” UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, said on X on Sunday.Gaza’s Health Ministry said Sunday that more than 130 people were killed and over 400 injured in the past 24 hours, taking the death toll since the war broke out to more than 58,000. Women and children make up more than half of those killed, according to the ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The attacks on Israel by Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023, killed about 1,200 people, most of them Israeli civilians. About 250 hostages were taken back to Gaza.At least 7,450 people in Gaza have been killed since the ceasefire broke on March 18, the ministry said. Sunday’s strike occurred as Israel and Hamas appeared no closer to a breakthrough on a ceasefire over the weekend. Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Washington, where President Donald Trump said he was optimistic about the possibility of a two-month truce between the two sides.",
