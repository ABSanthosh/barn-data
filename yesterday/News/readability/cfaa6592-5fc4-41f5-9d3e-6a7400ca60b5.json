  "text": "Israel's military has admitted to a \"complete failure\" in preventing Hamas's deadly October 7, 2023, attack, acknowledging overconfidence and misjudgments about the militant group’s capabilities. The internal probe, released on Thursday, comes as a fragile ceasefire approaches its first phase deadline.The October 7 attack, which saw Hamas militants breach Israel's defences and kill over 1,200 people, was the deadliest in the nation's history. The Israeli military's response resulted in more than 48,000 deaths in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.'The responsibility is mine'A military official briefing reporters on the findings, speaking anonymously, said, \"Too many civilians died that day asking themselves in their hearts or out loud, where was the IDF?\" Another senior military official admitted that the army had been \"overconfident\" and underestimated Hamas’s military strength.Following the report's release, Israel's military chief General Herzi Halevi stated, \"The responsibility is mine.\" Halevi had previously resigned last month, citing the failure of October 7.Truce talks in CairoThe ceasefire, which began on January 19, has brought a temporary halt to the fighting, but a second phase aimed at ending the war permanently has not been agreed upon. However, negotiations are underway in Cairo, where Israeli and Qatari officials, along with US representatives, have gathered.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent negotiators just two days before the truce’s first phase deadline, after Hamas returned the remains of four hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. \"We’re making a lot of progress. Israel is sending a team right now as we speak,\" US envoy Steve Witkoff said in Washington.Hostage-prisoner exchangeAs part of the truce, Hamas has freed 25 Israeli and dual-national hostages, along with five Thai prisoners, while Israel is expected to release around 1,900 Palestinian detainees. Israel's Prison Service confirmed that \"643 terrorists were transferred from several prisons across the country\" as part of the deal.Among the released prisoners is Nael Barghouti, the longest-serving Palestinian inmate, who spent over four decades in jail for the murder of an Israeli officer. Freed Palestinian prisoners were taken to hospitals in Khan Yunis for medical assessments, while some previously released Israeli hostages appeared emaciated, raising concerns over their conditions in captivity.‘A very tough day’The identities of the four hostages whose remains were returned were confirmed as Ohad Yahalomi, Tsachi Idan, Itzik Elgarat, and Shlomo Mansour. Netanyahu’s office stated that Yahalomi, Idan, and Elgarat were \"murdered while held hostage in Gaza,\" while Mansour was killed on October 7.Israel Berman, a former member of the Nahal Oz kibbutz where Idan was abducted, said, \"Until the very last moment, we were hoping that Tsachi would return to us alive... This morning brought us the harsh news. It's a very tough day.\"Uncertain future for the ceasefireDespite ongoing negotiations, Netanyahu faces domestic criticism for his handling of the war and the hostage situation. His coalition includes members eager to resume military operations. Of the 251 hostages taken by Hamas on October 7, 58 remain in Gaza, with 34 confirmed dead, according to the Israeli military.Meanwhile, the war has devastated Gaza, with the UN reporting that over 69 percent of its buildings have been damaged or destroyed, nearly the entire population displaced, and severe hunger gripping the region.",
