(Bloomberg) — Just four months ago, Delta Electronics (Thailand) Pcl’s shares were outpacing global peers, prompting a series of moves from Thai market authorities to halt the rally. Now, the stock is in a stark reversal. Most Read from Bloomberg Why Did the Government Declare War on My Adorable Tiny Truck? How SUVs Are Making Traffic Worse Trump Slashed International Aid. Geneva Is Feeling the Impact. These US Bridges Face High Risk of Catastrophic Ship Strikes Affordable Housing Developers Stalled by Blocked Federal Funds Its shares have cratered more than 50% in 2025, notching a steeper decline than any of the world’s electronic-part makers worth at least $500 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This year’s tumble wiped out about $30 billion of Delta’s market value and made the stock the biggest laggard on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The slide for what was once Thailand’s most valuable stock is an extreme example of how the artificial intelligence craze has created excessive valuations. The slump, which began after shares reached a record high in November, accelerated after the stock exchange’s proposed index weighting curbs and lower-than-expected earnings. The company faces “key headwinds to earnings from rising cost structure” and slowing growth, said Yugi Takeshima, an analyst at Maybank Securities (Thailand) Pcl. The AI boom is unlikely to create significant growth for Delta in 2025, according to Takeshima, who has a sell recommendation on the stock. READ: Delta Thailand’s 165% Stock Surge Unhealthy, Says CEO The unit of Taiwan’s Delta Electronics Inc. makes components for automobiles and data center chargers, among other products. Its stock shed 23% on Feb. 17 after reporting full-year net income that missed analysts’ estimates. The company this week disclosed a 54% slide in fourth-quarter earnings and clarified the reasons for its poor results. READ: Delta Thailand Stock Surge May Wane as AI Boost Seen Overdone Delta’s profit outlook could further weigh on shares. Core earnings are expected to drop 5% in 2025 in part thanks to higher income tax, said Takeshima, who earlier this month nearly halved his price target on the stock. The Thai government will likely raise the company’s average income tax rate to 15% from about 3% to 5% historically, he said. In addition, Thailand’s bourse in November set restrictions on Delta’s stock trading in an effort to limit excessive speculation. It also proposed a cap on the weighting of single stocks on some of its main indexes after Delta dominated several gauges during its share surge. Delta currently makes up about 6% of the benchmark SET Index, down from around 12% in November, Bloomberg-compiled data shows.",
