Interestingly, he has a rather fancy career aspiration for a royal family member; he wants to become a chef.While visiting a restaurant in Norfolk, Prince George declared that he could see his future self working in a kitchen, after being fascinated by a wood-fired pizza oven.George visited the Wiveton Hall Cafe with his mother, Catherine, Princess of Wales, and their friends. Desmond MacCarthy, the owner of Wiveton Hall Cafe, shared that the 11-year-old prince was fascinated by the wood-fired pizza oven and said, \"That's what I want to do when I grow up!\"MacCarthy, whose 17th-century manor and cafe were featured in the 2016 BBC documentary ‘Normal For Norfolk,’ spoke fondly of George, saying, \"He was a sweet boy – they start to become less appealing as they grow up.\" The cafe is near Blakeney and is not far from Sandringham, where the royal family has a residence, Anmer Hall.Unfortunately, George's dream of working at Wiveton Hall Cafe won’t come true, as the cafe is closing next month after 17 years in business. Once praised by culinary legends like Delia Smith, who called it the \"best food in Britain,\" the cafe is shutting down due to rising costs and staffing challenges.MacCarthy acknowledged the challenges, saying that although they had a busy summer, running a seasonal business year-round has become difficult. \"It's sad when things change, but I believe something new will come along,\" he said.",
