  "text": "Celebratory gunfire. Statues torn down. Families reunited after prisoners were unexpectedly set free.In just a few days, a broad coalition of Syrian rebel forces have dislodged President Bashar al-Assad’s control over the cities of Aleppo and Hama after a four-year stalemate. The lightning offensive, led by the armed Islamist faction Hayat Tahrir al-Shams, or HTS, has continued to build momentum, moving south along the M5 highway, Syria’s most important artery. By Saturday morning the group appeared poised to overtake Homs — an industrial center and the “capital of the Syrian revolution.”On Dec. 6, a separate anti-Assad faction captured Syria’s southernmost city of Daraa. It’s not yet clear how this faction, the Southern Operations Room, is connected to HTS, although it’s clear the faction has been motivated by HTS’s success.Less than two weeks ago this is what Syria’s control map looked like.Today it is a far different picture, with Damascus — the country’s capital and Assad stronghold — nearly surrounded and on the brink of collapse.Nov. 30: The fall of AleppoRebels breached the western limits of Aleppo — Syria’s second city — on Nov. 29, for the first time since December 2016. They moved quickly into the city center, careening through the streets, firing weapons and honking horns, as government forces fled.Rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad roamed the streets of Syria's Aleppo on Nov. 29, saying they have liberated it from Assad's hold. (Video: Reuters)As of Nov. 30, video footage verified by The Post showed rebels pacing in front of the international airport and posting selfies on the steps of Aleppo’s 12th-century citadel. A day later, a fighter knelt to kiss the ground in front of a military school as HTS overtook regime territory west of Aleppo.The Syrian military, backed by Russian fighter jets, responded with a volley of strikes on Aleppo and the surrounding area. However, there have been no further strikes on the city since Dec. 2, according to data collected by ACLED, a U.S.-based war monitor.Dec. 5: The Fall of HamaBy Dec. 1, rebel forces were pushing south toward the city of Hama, but Assad’s forces managed to hold off the sudden advance.Over the next five days, the rebel coalition captured nearby towns and positioned themselves at hastily abandoned military installations, video verified by online researchers and confirmed by The Post showed.A statue of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's father, Hafez, was toppled by crowds in Hama, Syria, late on Dec. 5. (Video: Obtained by Reuters)Under pressure, Assad ordered an immediate salary increase for conscripted forces, Syria’s state news agency reported on Wednesday. Russian jets continued to strike targets across the province, ACLED data shows.On Dec. 5, fighters took control of Hama, releasing prisoners from Assad’s infamous prisons. Videos showed long-awaited reunions, as people streamed out of Hama Central Prison — some emerging for the first time in nearly 40 years, following the bloody crackdown on the opposition by Assad’s father in 1982.The Syrian rebel-backed media site al-Askare published video on Dec. 5 showing prisoners being released from Hama Central Prison. (Video: al-Askare via Storyful)Dec. 7: The Fall of DaraaOn Dec. 6, a faction of anti-Assad fighters swept through the southern city of Daraa, waving opposition flags. By nightfall, crowds had converged into a makeshift parade, dragging the remnants of an Assad statue.Experts described the opposition in Daraa as a mixed coalition of former rebels, including local strongmen and clan figures, who were forced to concede to Assad in 2018.“Many people have wanted this for a long time, but have been unable to act,” said Aron Lund, a Middle East analyst at Century International. “The events in the north gave them an opportunity to do it.”A large group of motorbikes carrying at least one flag affiliated with rebel forces sweep through the southernmost Syrian city of Daraa on Dec. 6. (Video: X)After asserting control of the city center, resistance fighters fanned out, some surging north toward Damascus, and others pushing south toward Jordan.On Dec. 7, Jordanian authorities closed Jaber-Naseeb terminal, sealing off the only passenger and commercial border crossing into Syria, following local media reports of gunshots and fighting at the border.Ongoing: The battle for HomsAnti-Assad fighters are moving into the strategic city of Homs — once a center of Syria’s resistance and a critical economic waypoint between gas reserves in the east and the regime’s coastal ports, home to two Russian military bases.On Friday, HTS commanders announced that they had seized control of areas six kilometers north of Homs. By the end of the day, they were calling on regime soldiers to defect.“If they overtake Homs, it will sever Damascus from the coast and basically bisect the regime,” Lund said, adding that such a disruption could cue a “death spiral” for the Syrian state.Residents of Homs topple a statue of the former Syrian president on Dec. 7 as rebel groups advanced to the heart of the city. (Video: Ahmad Emad Zakzak /Facebook and X)But the regime’s retreat has continued.On Saturday, Assad’s forces withdrew from the “T4 Airport,” the regime’s largest military base east of Homs, according to local media. Hours later, HTS said it was advancing into the heart of the city.Damascus — the last standFrom the north and the south, rebel commanders are vowing to continue on to Damascus, posing the biggest threat to the Assad regime in its nearly 54 years of autocratic family rule. Rebel groups are closing in on Damascus, as they overtake suburb after suburb.Video verified by The Post showed a statue of the former Syrian president being toppled by protesters on Dec. 7 about 10 miles outside the capital, Damascus. (Video: Obtained by Reuters)Residents reported shops closing and a shortage of cash in the capital on Saturday. Video verified by The Post showed men toppling a sculpture of Assad in Jaramana, less than 10 miles from the presidential palace.HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani said that rebel forces were on the verge of toppling “the criminal regime.”Imogen Piper in London contributed to this report.",
