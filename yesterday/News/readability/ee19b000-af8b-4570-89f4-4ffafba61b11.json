  "description": "Donald Trump, during an interview on the Dan Bongino Show, discussed how he was surprised Harvey Weinstein faced severe punishment despite being backed by Democrats. Trump referred to Weinstein as the 'king of the woke' and said Democrats typically protect their own. “But boy — you don’t know him well, I don’t know him well, but I watched that and it was amazing. So when they do get hit, they get hit. But that’s the only one I can think of, normally they protect everybody,” he continued. “What they did was Adams, I think, is very suspect.”",

  "text": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made a comment on sex offender film producer Harvey Weinstein at the Dan Bongino Show. He said he was amazed that Harvey Weinstein got his due because Democrats usually protect their own. Calling Weinstein 'king of the woke', Trump said it's interesting that he got hit so hard. “Democrats don’t have to be honest, they really don’t have to be honest, because they will never be accused of anything.It’s interesting,” Trump said. “I was so amazed that Harvey Weinstein got schlonged, he got hit as hard as you can get hit. Because he was sort of the king of the woke, right? And yet he got hit and I figured, maybe, he wouldn’t get hit so hard.”“But boy — you don’t know him well, I don’t know him well, but I watched that and it was amazing. So when they do get hit, they get hit. But that’s the only one I can think of, normally they protect everybody,” he continued. “What they did was Adams, I think, is very suspect.”Complaints against Harvey Weinstein started the Me Too movement in 2017 and in 2020, the film mogul was found guilty of rape but the conviction was overturned in 2014. Earlier, Donald Trump said he never liked Weinstein as he worked against Trump's candidacy in 2016. \"So I was never a fan of Harvey Weinstein, as you know. In fact, he said he was gonna work hard to defeat me in the election,\" Trump said after Weistein's conviction \"How did that work out, by the way? I’m trying to figure that out. He was a person I didn’t like, never liked. I don’t know too much about the case because, you know, between traveling and being at meetings almost every hour of the day, every minute of the day, I haven’t really been able to see too much of it.\"After his Dan Bongino comment, Dems said Donald Trump was actually bemoaning that Weistein got punished but Trump was slamming the Democrats and the wokes. This is not the first time Trump has used the term “Schlonged” in this manner. In 2015, he used it in reference to Hillary Clinton losing her primary run in 2008, among other past instances.",
