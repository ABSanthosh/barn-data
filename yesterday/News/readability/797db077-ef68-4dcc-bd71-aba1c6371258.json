  "text": "Iranians awoke early Saturday to the sounds of explosions in Tehran and other parts of the country, blasts that drew some residents to their rooftops to watch as Iran’s air defense systems responded to Israeli strikes.But soon after Israel’s attack, which it said hit 20 military targets and that lasted several hours, life in Iran appeared to return to normal, with shoppers crowding markets, traffic snarling the streets of the capital and residents making the usual commute to work.Danial, a 45-year-old architect in Mashhad, in the country’s northeast, took a shared taxi to his office Saturday. “I don’t think people are worried about an escalation,” he said, citing the conversations he had with fellow passengers. He spoke on the condition he be identified only by his first name, for fear of reprisal by Iranian security forces.Much of the chatter, he said, was focused on the limited nature of the attack, as well as the economy. “For ordinary people, honestly, the economy is just the first and last concern,” he said.Iranian authorities have also characterized the strikes as limited, saying attacks in Tehran in the north, Ilam in the west and Khuzestan in the southwest inflicted only minimal damage, without elaborating.The targets were military sites in those three provinces, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the country’s most powerful military and security institution. Israel’s military said it targeted missile manufacturing facilities, surface-to-air missile arrays and Iranian aerial capabilities.Satellite imagery taken the morning after the strikes shows at least five damaged structures at manufacturing sites in Parchin and Khojir, both east of Tehran.According to Fabian Hinz, a fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the damaged sites are where Iran builds the motors used in its missiles. Striking these facilities, Hinz said, creates a crucial bottleneck, “if you can’t produce the motors, you can’t produce the missiles.”The complex in Parchin uses specialty mixers to produce the motors that Iran uses to propel its most advanced missiles, which it has previously fired at Israel. With these facilities out of operation, Hinz added, “Iran right now is in a position where it needs to replenish its stockpiles and prepare for further [missile] exchanges. This strike makes it more difficult.” The damage to these sites was first geolocated by Samir on X.Reports suggested, however, there were no attacks on Iran’s oil production or nuclear facilities, targets that could unleash a worse cycle of violence. “Iran’s nuclear facilities have not been impacted,” Rafael Mariano Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, wrote on X.Still, at least four soldiers were killed, Iranian state media reported, citing the country’s conventional military. And Iran’s Foreign Ministry released a statement Saturday calling the strikes “a blatant violation of international law.” It said the country was “entitled and obliged to defend” itself against external attacks, but that it was also “cognizant of its responsibilities for regional peace and security.”Israel and Iran have long fought a shadow war in the Middle East, using subterfuge and attacks on proxies or commercial assets as stand-ins for an all-out conflict. But now, that war is out in the open, with both countries launching direct strikes on each other’s territory since April, when Israel carried out a strike on an Iranian embassy compound in Damascus, Syria.Tensions soared in the wake of the Hamas attacks on Israel last year, a bloody rampage that has had reverberations across the region. The most recent escalation began when Israel first assassinated Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, followed by its killing of Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah in Beirut last month.On Oct. 1, Iran retaliated for the deaths of two of its allies, firing around 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, most of which were intercepted, but with some hitting Israeli air bases.In Iran, as the attack unfolded early Saturday — beginning around 2 a.m. local time and lasting until dawn, at roughly 6 a.m. — state broadcasters urged calm. Some channels continued to air scheduled programming overnight, while others showed live feeds from Tehran, with normal, quiet scenes below the city skyline.The Tasnim news agency, which is affiliated with the Revolutionary Guard, posted a video of Tehran’s skyline and wrote, “there is no fire or smoke in this scene.”Hours later, when Iranian officials started commenting on the strikes, they downplayed the attack, calling it “weak” and a “major escalation.”Israel “does not dare to do anything serious,” said a prominent member of parliament, Ali Asghar Nakhaei, according to state media. He said Israel’s threats ahead of the strikes “were nothing more than a lie.”Elmira, 35, works for an online clothing boutique in Tehran. She said she and her neighbors watched the strikes from their rooftop overnight. But once she arrived at her office later Saturday morning, it was like any other day at work. “We had a new batch of clothes [this] morning. So, cargo was working as usual,” she said.Iran’s battered currency also rose slightly on Saturday, following reports that the attacks were less extensive than many feared. “Iranian markets under the umbrella of air defense,” read one headline from the government-owned Mehr news agency.During a trip to the bakery, however, Danial from Mashhad said shoppers were still “complaining about the soaring prices.”Despite the calm, analysts said the attack chipped away at Iran’s deterrence — and that the leadership might be forced to respond.Israel was probably seeking to complicate an Iranian response when it targeted its air defenses Saturday, according to Farzan Sabet, a Middle East security researcher at the Global Governance Center at the Geneva Graduate Institute in Switzerland.The attacks on air defenses potentially decrease Iran’s capacity to strike back, depending on the scale of the damage, Sabet said. And “could give Israel much greater freedom of action to conduct similar operations or even larger ones in the future.”Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said as much after the attack concluded.“We targeted Iran’s surface-to-air missile arrays and Iranian aerial capabilities that were intended to restrict Israel’s aerial freedom of operation in Iran,” he said in a statement. “Israel now has broader aerial freedom of operation in Iran.”As Iran decides whether it will respond to Israel’s attack, Tehran will probably continue to control what information is released about Saturday’s strikes, Sabet said.“This is something that really works in their favor,” because the targets hit were military facilities, removed from public view, he said. “So they have a little bit of breathing room to downplay the scale of the attack, and take some time to figure out their response.”Ley reported from New York.",
