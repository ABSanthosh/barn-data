Mr. Trudeau said that he had suspended Parliament until March 24 and that he would stay on as Liberal Party leader and prime minister until his replacement had been chosen through a nationwide party election.“I truly feel that removing the contention around my own continued leadership is an opportunity to bring the temperature down,” he said.Mr. Trudeau, 53, who rose to power nearly a decade ago and quickly became seen as a progressive icon, is the latest leader in the West to be swept aside by a mood of anti-incumbency, a backlash against immigration and anger at the lingering effects of a spike in inflation during the coronavirus pandemic. Although inflation in Canada has receded to below 2 percent, unemployment remains high, at above 6 percent.General elections must be held by October, a timetable that Mr. Trudeau referred to on Monday.“It’s become obvious to me with the internal battles that I cannot be the one to carry the Liberal standard into the next election,” he said.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
