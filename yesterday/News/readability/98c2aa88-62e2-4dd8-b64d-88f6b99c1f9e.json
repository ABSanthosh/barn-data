  "text": "A nearly 200-year-old tree on the White House grounds is set to be removed due to its deteriorating condition, US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday.The southern magnolia, which has stood near the curved portico on the south side of the building for generations, is a major landmark, serving as the welcome point for ceremonial visits by foreign leaders and is close to the departure point for Marine One, the presidential helicopter.According to the national park service, historical accounts suggested that President Andrew Jackson brought the tree’s seeds from his home near Nashville, Tennessee. He is believed to have planted it in memory of his wife, Rachel, who passed away shortly before he took office in 1829.Trump addressed the tree’s removal on his social media platform, Truth Social, saying, “The bad news is that everything must come to an end, and this tree is in terrible condition, a very dangerous safety hazard, at the White House Entrance, no less, and must now be removed.”“This process will take place next week, and will be replaced by another, very beautiful tree.”He also hinted at a future use for the tree’s wood, “It may be used for other high and noble purposes!!!”The historic magnolia has faced challenges over the years. It was significantly pruned in 2017 during Trump’s first term and suffered damage in 1994 when a small Cessna plane crashed onto the South Lawn, skidding into the White House.",
