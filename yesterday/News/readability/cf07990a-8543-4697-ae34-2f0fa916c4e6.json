  "text": "DOGE cost-cutter-in-chief Elon Musk likened the U.S. retirement system to a pyramid scheme during a podcast with Joe Rogan, arguing something needed to be done to stave off any threat of potential insolvency. The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, fears America’s state-backed pensions are no longer safe as fewer working-age Americans can pay for retirees who live a longer life. Speaking on the Joe Rogan podcast for the first time since his appearance just prior to the November election, he likened Social Security to an illegal pyramid scheme where returns are generated not through prudent capital allocation, but an influx of money from new investors. “Social Security is the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,” Musk said. The national press office for the Social Security Administration could not be reached by Fortune for comment. When Americans retire, they collect their basic pension, the costs of which are financed through payroll taxes. Employees contribute 6.2% of their wages up to a maximum of $176,100, while U.S. employers have to match that sum as part of their non-wage labor costs. This is known as a “pay as you go” system. It is typical of most wealthy countries, which all copied the same approach based on the assumption that a country’s birth-death rate would continue to favor a growing population. With over 75 million baby boomers set to retire by 2030, this prediction is no longer valid. With Social Security comprising one-fifth of all federal spending, the system is coming under stress now that there are fewer working-age Americans paying in to fund their pensions—something that will only get worse as the Trump administration cracks down on immigration. At the same time, retirees are living longer, exacerbating these stress factors. “We better fix what we’ve got right now, because if it’s bad now, it’s going to be much worse in the future,” Musk continued. As a result of concerns over Social Security, a political feud is brewing over whether or not painful structural reforms are needed to ensure its fiscal viability, such as hiking the retirement age substantially or even cutting benefits. John Larson, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means subcommittee for Social Security, blasted the attack as evidence of a plan to gut the costly entitlement program. “We will stand together to resist these cuts in every way possible,” he said in a Sunday statement. In response, some are advocating for an end to the cap that means wealthier Americans can cover their contribution within weeks or even days of the new year—presumably without a proportionate increase to their benefits.",
