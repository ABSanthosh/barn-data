Mr. Zelensky appeared to reject it on Thursday, saying that nuclear plants were state-owned and could not be privatized, although he welcomed economic cooperation with the U.S. side. He added that the issue of U.S. ownership of the plants had not been directly addressed during the call.Only one of Ukraine’s four nuclear plants — the Zaporizhzhia plant, now under Russian control — had been discussed in the conversation, Mr. Zelensky said. “If the Americans are thinking about how to find a way out of this situation, if they want to take it away from the Russians, invest in its restoration, this is an open question,” he told a news conference during a visit to Norway.Beyond the confusion over what had been discussed, one thing was clear: Mr. Trump wants a big economic stake in Ukraine.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
