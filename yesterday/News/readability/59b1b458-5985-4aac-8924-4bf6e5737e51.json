The rumors that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are heading for divorce took a backseat as the ex-royals have now jointly purchased a new home in Portugal. But that does not put an end to Meghan's concerns. A report said Meghan is deeply concerned that the Royal Family will try and \"manipulate Harry into reintegrating without her\". \"Buying in Portugal is a shrewd move for Meghan. She’s deeply concerned that the Royal Family might manipulate Harry into reintegrating without her, so she needs to be proactive to make sure she’s not isolated or pushed to the sidelines,\" a report said citing a source. “Now, if it is deemed safe from a security standpoint, it’s likely she’ll give her blessing for Harry to take Archie and Lilibet to see their grandpa, King Charles, at some point.\"\"And in terms of logistics, having a place in Portugal will make that easier, because Meghan can fly over with the kids without feeling trapped.\"But no reconciliation on the horizon: Royal authorWhile Meghan may remain concerned over Harry returning to the royal fold, there is no sign of reconciliation on the horizon and the time is also not good as King Charles has been urged not to answer Harry's messages or calls to keep his stress levels down, royal author Robert Harman said. \"I know people keep saying, ‘Why doesn’t he see Harry when he is in town? Why can’t they patch things up?’\"\"But right now, there is a sense that we’ve just got to keep the king’s stress levels down. We don’t want him to have extra things to worry about. Let’s get through this…\"A reconciliation became a possibility after Prince William mentioned his estranged brother Harry in a documentary -- an extract of which was released earlier. There are debates about whether it was an olive branch from William. Reports said Harry has been given an ultimatum to mend the rift. Harry must \"eat humble pie\" after William mentioned him, royal commentator Rupert Bell said.",
