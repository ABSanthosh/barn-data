  "text": "Michael Moore said the only pollster he respects has also predicted a Kamala Harris victory.Fahrenheit 9/11 director Michael Moore who wrote a blog post last month saying that former president Donald Trump is \"toast\" said his confidence in Kamala Harris continues and MAGA people are going to be very surprised by what's going to happen Tuesday. On MSNBC, the 70-year-old Academy Award winner who rightly predicted the 2016 election said, \"I don’t want to say it too loudly, because our work isn’t done, right?\".“I feel the same way that I felt a few weeks ago — that Trump is toast. Absolutely, I feel it more now.”“Frankly, I know people watching this [will say] ‘Mike, how can you say that? You know all these crazy people, and all these Trumpsters and MAGA nation.’ And what I say to them is, honestly, I have a lot of personal, deep faith in my fellow Americans.”Moore said the Trump campaign isn't really in touch with where the majority of Americans are at. “The majority of Americans do not want this divisiveness, they don’t want the threat of violence,” Moore said.“We are OK to disagree with each other, but that’s where it ends. We go to vote, who wins wins. Half the time I’ve been very happy with who’s won, and the other half the time I haven’t been, and then we move on with our lives,” he said.\"Virtually no one agreed with my assessment that Trump would beat Hillary, that Biden would beat Trump, and that the “Red Wave” of “up to 40 new Republican seats being added in the House of Representatives” in 2022 was a total fantasy and that, in fact, there would be a Blue Wave of Democrats elected 2 years ago who would form what everyone now agrees is a Blue Wall,\" Moore wrote in his blogpost on Monday. Moore also presented analyst Rachel Bitecofer's prediction which discussed the popular predictions including Silver Nate's and Ann Selzer's and concluded that her gut says it's Harris.Also See:US Presidential Election | Trump Vs Kamala Harris | Swing States | Donald Trump",
