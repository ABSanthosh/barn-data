  "text": "Yemen’s Houthis said a U.S. missile strike hit a migrant detention center overnight, killing at least 68 African migrants and injuring dozens more.Large sections of the building in the city of Saada, a Houthi stronghold, were in rubble, as emergency responders raced to rescue survivors and removed the dead, according to photographs and video taken by a Reuters journalist at the scene. Paramedics could be seen carrying injured migrants away in stretchers as others received medical attention in a clinic.U.S. Central Command said in a statement that it was aware of the claims of civilian casualties. “We are currently conducting our battle-damage assessment and inquiry into those claims,” the statement said.U.S. forces have been engaged in a military campaign targeting Yemen’s Houthis since early 2024. Months before, the Iranian-backed group that controls much of Yemen launched a sustained assault on ships traversing the Red Sea, describing it as a response to Israel’s war in Gaza.Yemen’s Houthis said a U.S. missile strike hit a migrant detention center in Saada on April 28, killing dozens of African migrants and injuring dozens more. (Video: Reuters)Under the Trump administration, the United States has shifted its approach from mainly targeting Houthi military infrastructure to striking its leadership, monitoring groups have said. This month, Airwars, a Britain-based watchdog organization, said the administration appears to be “choosing targets that pose a more direct risk to civilians and may indicate a higher tolerance to the risk of civilian harm.”On Sunday, Centcom said that since escalating its military campaign against the Houthis on March 15, it has struck 800 targets in Yemen and killed hundreds of fighters and Houthi leaders. Centcom also said that the United States would no longer publicly disclose details of its military operations in Yemen to “preserve operational security.”The Pentagon is facing heightened scrutiny from some Democratic lawmakers over the number of civilians reported to have been killed in its intensified campaign against the Iranian-backed militants. On Thursday, three Democratic senators called on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to provide an explanation for the high number of Yemeni civilians reportedly killed and to describe the efforts taken by the Pentagon to avoid such casualties.In a statement at the time, a defense official said the Pentagon is “aware of reports” of civilian casualties and “takes these allegations very seriously and has a process to review them.”This month, a U.S. strike on a fuel depot in the Yemeni port of Ras Isa killed more than 70 people, according to Houthi leaders and local news reports, which did not specify how many of the dead were combatants or civilians. At the time, Centcom said the strike was “not intended to harm the people of Yemen.”Human rights groups say Yemen is a key route for African migrants undertaking the perilous journey over the Red Sea from the Horn of Africa to Saudi Arabia and the other gulf states, where many seek employment.Saada is a central hub along that route, according to Abdulghani Al-Iryani, a senior researcher at the Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies. Migrants are often intercepted by Houthis near the border and “are sent to the nearest city,” he said, where they spend “months and months” in detention without a court order.The Houthi-run al-Masirah TV reported Monday that the facility was housing about 100 migrants. The International Committee of the Red Cross said that it regularly visits the facility that was hit in Saada as part of its work advocating for more humane detention conditions in Yemen. It said the Yemen Red Crescent Society was helping evacuate the wounded to hospitals.“The ICRC is in constant contact with relevant health authorities to assess the situation,” the organization said, adding that it is not involved in running or supervising the facility.Cate Brown in Washington and Mohamad El Chamaa in Beirut contributed to this report.",
