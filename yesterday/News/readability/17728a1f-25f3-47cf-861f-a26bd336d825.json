Interest rates should follow us all over.\"The comments represented an initial strike at Fed officials, with whom he had a highly contentious relationship during his first term in office. He frequently criticized Chair Jerome Powell, who Trump appointed, on occasion calling policymakers \"boneheads\" and comparing Powell to a golfer who can't putt.Stocks reacted slightly positive on the comments, with the Dow Jones Industrial average extending gains as Trump spoke and the policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury yield edging a bit lower.In the flurry of activity surrounding the president's first week in office, he has not discussed his views on monetary policy. However, during the presidential campaign Trump indicated that he should get a say in interest rate decisions.Speaking later in the day to reporters, Trump said he expects the Fed to listen to him and plans to speak to Powell \"at the right time.\"For their part, Powell and his colleagues have emphasized the importance of Fed independence.
