  "text": "The govt of Somalia's semi-autonomous Puntland region said Sunday that US military strikes in the Golis mountains on the previous day had killed \"key figures\" in the Islamic State group. President Donald Trump said Sunday that Americans may feel economic \"pain\" from his tariffs on key trading partners, but argued it would be \"worth the price\" to secure US interests. The trade penalties that Trump signed Saturday caused a mix of panic, anger and uncertainty.\"Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe (and maybe not!)\" Trump wrote Sunday morning in all-caps on his Truth Social media platform. \"But we will Make America Great Again, and it will all be worth the price that must be paid.\" Despite Trump's claim that the US does not need Canada, one-quarter of the oil that the America consumes per day is from its ally to the north. Trump contended that without that surplus, \"Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada - AND NO TARIFFS!\". AFP \u0026 AP",
