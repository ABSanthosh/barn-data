  "text": "The Syrian rebel coalition that ousted Bashar al-Assad, led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), said Wednesday that it has further consolidated control over the country’s east as it seeks to build a new political order in the country.Mohammed al-Bashir, who previously led the HTS-backed governing body in Syria’s Idlib province, said he will serve as Syria’s caretaker prime minister until March, with the backing of the rebel coalition. Bashir told Al Jazeera it was time for “stability and calm.”Live coverage contributors 10Strikes continue in Gaza’s Beit Lahia, leaving more than 30 killed or under rubbleReturn to menuStrikes in the northern Gazan city of Beit Lahia killed or left under rubble more than 30 people over the last day, Hossam Abu Safiya, director of the embattled Kamal Adwan hospital, said Wednesday.“Throughout the night, more than seven explosive drones were deployed around Kamal Adwan Hospital, resulting in the bombing of entire buildings and the destruction of residential blocks,” he said in a statement shared Wednesday by Med Global, a U.S.-based medical NGO with whom he works.Abu Safiya said that one strike hit a building housing the extended Abu Tarabish family. “We received distress calls from neighbors and from individuals trapped under the rubble, but we are unable to leave the hospital due to the ongoing danger,” he said.The Israel Defense Forces in a statement said that “a strike was conducted against a Hamas terrorist in the area of Jabalya in the vicinity of the Kamal Adwan Hospital.” The IDF said it is “continuing to examine the incident” but said “the number of casualties resulting from the strike published in the media is inaccurate.”In a separate incident, a strike killed a mother and two children at the hospital’s gate, Abu Safiya told The Post by WhatsApp. The IDF has repeatedly attacked North Gaza’s last three hospitals and forcibly displaced medical staff during a more than two-month-long siege of the border communities of Jabalya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia. The IDF has accused the hospitals of harboring Hamas militants but has not provided evidence.Abu Safiya, who himself was injured in a strike last month, said the hospital is treating around 120 patients and its oxygen, water and electricity systems need urgent repairs.Munir al-Bursh, the Director General of Gaza’s Health Ministry, told The Post by WhatsApp on Wednesday that Israeli forces had also besieged Beit Hanoun’s Indonesian hospital, where some 60 patients, their relatives and medical staff remained. He said communication was cut off and drones with snipers and explosions were circling the area, preventing people from leaving or reaching the hospital.OCHA, the U.N. humanitarian agency, said in a statement Tuesday that Israeli authorities had denied 16 of 17 requests by aid agencies to reach the besieged northern communities between Dec. 1 and Dec. 9. One mission to evacuate patients and bring supplies to Kamal Adwan hospital on Dec. 1 was “impeded” after long delays, OCHA said.Syrian rebels burn tomb of late president Hafez al-AssadReturn to menuIn the northwestern Syrian town of Qardaha, rebel fighters destroyed the tomb of late Syrian president Hafez al-Assad, father of the recently ousted Bashar al-Assad, who has sought refuge in Moscow, local reports and wire images show.Hafez al-Assad came to power in 1970; his son took over the office after his death in 2000. Hafez established the family’s reputation for cruelty with a harsh crackdown on a Muslim Brotherhood uprising in Hama in 1982, which killed tens of thousands of people.As rebel groups led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham advanced quickly throughout Syria earlier this month, crowds toppled several statues of the late president in cities including Hama and outside Damascus. In the city of Daraa, a makeshift parade dragged remnants of an Assad statue.People dismantled other symbols of Bashar al-Assad and his father, defacing public portraits and ransacking the presidential palace.Who is Mohammed al-Bashir, Syria’s new caretaker prime minister?Return to menuHayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), one of the Syrian rebel groups that led the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has appointed Mohammed al-Bashir as the leader of Syria’s interim government.Bashir previously led the HTS-backed civilian government in Syria’s Idlib province, where he was born.Bashir graduated in 2007 from Aleppo University with a degree in electrical engineering, according to a biography posted on the HTS government website. In 2021, he earned a degree in sharia and law from Idlib University. Aside from his roles in HTS governance in the areas the group controlled before the past week’s developments, he worked at the Syria Gas Company, according to the biography, which does not provide further details.As a relatively low-profile figure, he has no high-level track record to offer clues as to how he will govern, and the degree of his ability to act independently remains unknown.Bashir said Tuesday that he would run a “transitional government” until March 1. He said the interim government would work to merge HTS government ministries with existing equivalents from the “deposed regime.”U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that the United States would “recognize and fully support” a Syrian government that comes out of a “Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition.”HTS is designated by the United States as a foreign terrorist organization. Asked at a briefing Tuesday whether the United States considered Bashir part of HTS and its designation as a terrorist organization, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said such determinations would come from a “fact-based assessment.”Iran’s supreme leader accuses U.S. and Israel of orchestrating Assad ousterReturn to menuIn his first address since the toppling of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Iran’s supreme leader blasted the United States and Israel, accusing them of orchestrating the overthrow of one of Tehran’s key allies.“The main plotter, the main planner, the main agent, the main command room is in the United States and in the Zionist regime,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Wednesday to a crowd of hundreds packed into a Tehran hall to hear his address.His remarks, while steeped in the Islamic Republic’s rhetorical tradition of condemnations of Israel and its Western allies, verged at moments into rare confluence with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s characterizations of Assad’s fall. In an address earlier this week, Netanyahu said the collapse of the Assad regime was “a direct result of the blows” Israeli forces “have dealt to Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran.”In his speech Wednesday, Khamenei spoke for roughly an hour, seated in a simple chair before a pair of microphones. He held a thin stack of note cards in one hand that he occasionally referenced.Khamenei sharply criticized Israeli military actions in Syria since Assad’s fall — a campaign of heavy airstrikes and the movement of ground forces into Syrian territory along Israel’s border. He praised Iran’s military and intelligence services and said Syria’s army was too weakened for help from Tehran to have made a difference. And he pledged that setbacks in Syria would only strengthen the resistance against the United States and Israel.“The more you add pressure, the more steadfast it is, the more crimes you commit, the more it is motivated,” he said. The crowd chanted back: “God is great!” “Death to Israel!” “Death to America!”This is an excerpt from a full story.Armed rebels consolidate control as Syria’s map is redrawnReturn to menuArmed rebel groups led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham said they took control of Deir al-Zour, a strategic and the largest city in eastern Syria, on Dec. 11. (Video: al-Askare via Storyful)Armed rebel groups led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham said they advanced farther into Syria’s east Wednesday, as they continue to redraw the country’s territorial map and fill the power vacuum left by Bashar al-Assad’s ousted regime.The rebel coalition’s fighters took control of Deir al-Zour, a strategic — and the largest — city in eastern Syria, along with its military airport and an oil field in the neighboring desert, the group claimed Wednesday. It was not immediately clear how the rebels took control, and The Washington Post could not immediately verify the claim.If confirmed, it would be the second time the eastern Syrian city has changed hands in less than a week. On Friday, Reuters reported that the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces entered Deir al-Zour after Assad’s government forces and Iranian-backed militias withdrew. The SDF did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday from The Post on the rebel coalition’s latest claim to have taken the city.In Syria’s north, where a parallel conflict has long taken place between the U.S.-backed SDF and Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA), the two sides said they reached a ceasefire agreement under which the SDF would withdraw from the northern city of Manbij.SDF commander Mazloum Abdi said in an early Wednesday post on X that a U.S.-brokered effort had resulted in the agreement. The Post could not immediately verify the claim of U.S. involvement.The day before, Gen. Michael “Erik” Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command, met with SDF forces at Syrian military bases, according to a Centcom statement.The U.S. has long provided support to the SDF — Syrian Kurds whom Turkey deems terrorists — in an effort to prevent Islamic State militants from gaining a foothold in the region, putting it at odds with Ankara, which has also supported HTS. The SDF has warned that the power vacuum in Syria could allow Islamic State remnants to resurge. The advance of rebels led by HTS has set off a wave of activity by Islamic State militants, including in Manbij, said Sinam Mohamad, head of SDF’s U.S. mission. “That is a threat to all of the region,” she said in an interview. “That means whatever we did through all of the years with the United States — with the global coalition to stop and end ISIS — it will all be gone in vain.”Turkey has long demanded the United States expel the SDF from Manbij, and has previously supported SNA’s assault against SDF forces in the city, according to Arabic press accounts.Abbie Cheeseman, Joe Snell and Mohamad El Chamaa contributed to this report.Blinken to travel to region to press U.S. vision for Syrian transitionReturn to menuWith Syria’s future deeply unsettled, Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel Wednesday to Jordan and Turkey to promote an inclusive political transition in Damascus, a spokesman said, meeting leaders in neighboring nations to try to get them on board.The top U.S. diplomat “will reiterate the United States’ support for an inclusive, Syrian-led transition to an accountable and representative government,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement. “He will discuss the need for the transition process and new government in Syria to respect the rights of minorities” and also will push for open channels of humanitarian assistance, and securing and destroying stockpiles of chemical weapons.Turkey has supported the main rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, that ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, giving Ankara outsize influence in the new political order.That has unsettled Syria’s other neighbors, who have long historical memories of Turkish empire in the region. Washington also wants to ensure that Turkey does not act against U.S.-backed Kurdish groups in Syria.Miller said Blinken will also discuss a Gaza ceasefire agreement with leaders.Monitoring the status of hostages still in Gaza after Hamas’s attackWar’s ebb in Lebanon leaves devastation and uncertain futureIsrael and Hezbollah agree to cease-fire, halting year-long conflict",
