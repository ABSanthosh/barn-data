  "text": "At least six tourists were killed Thursday when a submarine sank off Egypt’s Red Sea coast, according to Egyptian officials. At least five Russian tourists died, according to Russian officials in Egypt.The governor of Egypt’s Red Sea region, Maj. Gen. Amr Hanafy, said Thursday that the vessel was carrying 50 people: 45 passengers and five Egyptian crew members. He added that the passengers included Russians, Indians, Norwegians and Swedes.The submarine was making a routine excursion to observe coral reefs, according to a statement from the Russian Embassy in Egypt. Earlier, the embassy said that all of the passengers on board were Russian tourists.Emergency crews on the coast rescued 39 passengers, Hanafy said. Of those, 14 were hospitalized, according to the Russian news agency RIA Novosti. Several Egyptians and Indians were also hospitalized, the agency reported.The cause of the sinking is still unclear. The submarine sank about half a mile off the shore of the Egyptian resort town of Hurghada at 10 a.m. local time. The vessel, called Sindbad, was chartered by a resort of the same name.A website for the Sindbad submarine experience says “there are only 14 real recreational submarines in the world,” and Sindbad operates two of them. Trips last three hours and reach a maximum depth of about 82 feet. The company did not respond to a request for comment.Egypt is a popular tourist destination for Russians, with more than a million Russian tourists visiting the country every year over the past few years.The Red Sea has become a focal point of heightened regional tensions amid strikes on shipping by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, which have prompted an international response, including U.S. strikes on Yemen. Houthi attacks have targeted commercial shipping and Israel, not tourist vessels just off Egypt’s shore.",
