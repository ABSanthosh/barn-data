  "text": "Italy on Sunday released an Iranian engineer who is wanted by the United States over a drone strike last year that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan.Mohammad Abedini arrived in Iran on Sunday evening, Iranian state television reported, after Italian Justice Minister Carlo Nordio asked an Italian court to vacate his arrest.His release came days after Iran freed Cecilia Sala, an Italian journalist.Francine Moffett, whose 23-year-old daughter, Breonna, was killed in the attack last January, said her family was “at a loss for words.”“Just don’t know what to say,” she wrote in a text.The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Sala was arrested in Iran on Dec. 19, three days after Italian authorities seized Abedini at Milan Malpensa Airport on a U.S. warrant. The journalist, who is well known in Italy, was accused of “violating the laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran,” state media reported.Iranian officials insisted Sala was not arrested to secure Abedini’s release. The Italian government has denied that the sequence was a prisoner exchange.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, under domestic pressure for weeks to secure the journalist’s release, said last week that Sala’s freedom was won through intense diplomatic efforts between Iran, Italy and the United States. She said that 500 Italians are still in Iran and that the government needed to be “very cautious” in its dealings with Tehran.Iranian state media said Iran’s foreign and intelligence ministries worked together to resolve the “misunderstanding” that led to Abedini’s arrest.U.S. Army Reserve Sgt. William Jerome Rivers, Spec. Kennedy Ladon Sanders and Spec. Breonna Alexsondria Moffett were killed last January in a drone strike on Tower 22, a remote U.S. outpost in the Jordanian desert near Syria and Iraq. More than 40 service members were wounded in the attack. All were supporting Operation Inherent Resolve, the U.S.-led fight against the Islamic State.The United States accuses Abedini of operating a long-running scheme to circumvent U.S. laws that restrict exports to Iran. U.S. authorities say Abedini provided technology that Iran used in the strike.The more Sanders’s mother hears, she said, the angrier she gets. Sundays have been particularly hard for the family since Sunday, Jan. 28, 2024, when they learned that Sanders had been killed.“Although this news has deflated me a little, I’m still confident that the FBI will continue their investigation to bring all those involved to justice,” said Oneida Oliver-Sanders, the mother of Kennedy Sanders.Nordio’s request, which was based on a legal determination that the U.S. charges against Abedini would not be considered crimes in Italy, was rare.“I have no memory of similar cases,” said Nicola Gratteri, chief prosecutor of Naples. “We have a very strong bilateral treaty with the U.S. and have always had a great collaboration with them in terms of extradition, expulsion and investigation.”The Iranians freed Sala on Wednesday, days after Meloni raised her case during a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump in Florida last weekend. She has deflected questions on whether the current or incoming administration had given Italy a green light to be lenient with Abedini.President Joe Biden’s National Security Council spokesman, John Kirby, played down any U.S. role in Sala’s release and declined to say whether the White House had approved Italy’s negotiations. “This was an Italian decision from soup to nuts,” he said, referring further questions to the Italian government.The United States has been open to prisoner deals. In September 2023, Iran released five Americans who had been held there for years. In exchange, the United States dismissed charges against five imprisoned Iranians and facilitated the unfreezing of $6 billion in Iranian oil funds.",
