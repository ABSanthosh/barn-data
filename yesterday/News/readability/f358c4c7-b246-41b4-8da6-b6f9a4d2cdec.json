Adams was indicted on five charges of bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance violations in September. He has pleaded not guilty.He is accused of accepting illegal campaign funds and thousands of dollars in luxury travel benefits from Turkish businessmen and an official in exchange for his influence as mayor.Prosecutors are yet to indicate whether they intend to drop the case as requested. Any decision to do so will need to be formally submitted to the court and approved by a judge.The memo followed a reported meeting between Adams' lawyers and federal prosecutors in New York. Adams, a Democrat, has recently moved to build closer relations with Trump and his administration. He attended the presidential inauguration last month and also flew to Florida for a meeting. Adams has also said the city is co-operating with immigration raids.He has said, however, that he has not talked to President Trump about his corruption case.This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.
