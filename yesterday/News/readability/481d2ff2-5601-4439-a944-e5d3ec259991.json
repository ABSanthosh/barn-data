  "text": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he reached a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia that will set a 19% tariff on the southeast Asian country's U.S. exports.\"We will pay no tariffs. So they are giving us access into Indonesia, which we never had,\" Trump told reporters outside the White House.\"That's probably the biggest part of the deal. And the other part is they are going to pay 19%,\" he said.It was not immediately clear if Jakarta had approved the deal terms as described by Trump. The Indonesian Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.In a subsequent post on Truth Social, Trump said Indonesia \"has committed to purchasing $15 Billion Dollars in U.S. Energy, $4.5 Billion Dollars in American Agricultural Products, and 50 Boeing Jets, many of them 777's\" as part of the deal.Indonesian airline Garuda was recently in talks to buy between 50 and 75 Boeing aircraft, its CEO reportedly said in early July.If it comes to pass, the new tariff rate on Indonesian imports would show Trump pulling back on the 32% duty he had threatened to impose as recently as last week.Trump said in a brief social media post Tuesday morning that the agreement followed direct dealings with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto.\"I spoke to their really great president, very popular, very strong, smart, and we made the deal,\" Trump said at the White House later in the day.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested on CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" on Tuesday afternoon that Indonesia would drop its tariffs on U.S. goods as part of the agreement.\"No tariffs there. They pay tariffs here,\" Lutnick said.The White House did not respond to CNBC's requests for additional information about the purported deal with Indonesia.Indonesia is one of the United States' top 25 trade partners, with the two countries trading more than $38 billion in goods in 2024, according to the Commerce Department. The U.S. trade deficit with Indonesia totaled $17.9 billion last year.Read more CNBC politics coverageCuomo launches independent New York City mayoral bid after losing Democratic primary to MamdaniElon Musk looms over jury selection in Tesla Autopilot fatality trialIt's a huge week for crypto in D.C.
