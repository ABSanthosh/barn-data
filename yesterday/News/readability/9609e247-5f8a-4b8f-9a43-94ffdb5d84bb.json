Excluding food and energy, the news was even worse, with a 3.3% rate that showed core inflation, which the Fed tends to rely on more, also rising and holding well above the central bank's goal.Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in an appearance Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee, insisted the central bank had made \"great progress\" on inflation from its cycle peak \"but we're not quite there yet. So we want to keep policy restrictive for now.\"U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before a House Financial Services Committee hearing on \"The Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 12, 2025. Nathan Howard | ReutersAs the Fed targets 2% inflation and the report showed no recent progress, it also dimmed hopes that the central bank will view further policy easing as appropriate after it lopped a full percentage point off its benchmark short-term borrowing rate in 2024.Fed funds futures trading pointed to just a 2.5% chance of a March cut; only 13.2% in May, up to 22.8% in June, then 41.2% in July and finally up to 55.9% in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge as of late Wednesday morning. However, that would leave the probability still up in the air until October, when futures contracts pricing implies a 62.1% probability.Odds of a second cut by the end of 2025 were at just 31.3%, with pricing not indicating another reduction until late 2026. The fed funds rate is currently targeted in a range between 4.25%-4.5%.The issues raised in the CPI report are not happening in isolation. Policymakers also are watching White House trade policy, with President Donald Trump pushing aggressive tariffs that also could boost prices and complicate the Fed's desire to get to its goal.\"There is no getting away from the fact that this is a hot report and with the sense that potential tariffs run upside risk for inflation the market is understandably of the view the Federal Reserve is going to find it challenging to justify rate cuts in the near future,\" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.While the Fed pays attention to the CPI and other similar price measures, its preferred inflation gauge is the personal consumption expenditures price index, which the Bureau of Economic Analysis will release later in February. Elements from the CPI filter into the PCE reading, and Citigroup said it expects to see core PCE fall to 2.6% for January, a 0.2 percentage point decline from December.",
