  "text": "JERUSALEM — An influx of aid to the Gaza Strip in the first few days of the ceasefire was interrupted, at least temporarily, on Thursday after clashes between Hamas and organized looters broke out near the main crossing in the enclave’s south, according to residents, transport workers and video footage of the gunfight.More than 3,800 trucks carrying fuel and humanitarian relief have entered Gaza since the ceasefire took effect on Sunday, according to the United Nations, a massive increase compared with the volume of aid going in each day during the war.But the violence — which erupted near the Kerem Shalom crossing late Wednesday and continued Thursday — suggests the security around aid distribution within Gaza remains uncertain, even as U.N. and other aid workers reported near-unhindered access as they scale up assistance to more than 2 million people.Before the ceasefire, gangs of looters in southern Gaza were stealing much of the aid that entered the territory, hijacking trucks, and killing, beating and kidnapping Palestinian drivers. They were emboldened by the security vacuum that opened when Gaza’s civilian police force, targeted by Israel, stopped escorting the convoys.But as the truce took hold in recent days, police reemerged and began guarding the trucks — protection aid agencies have said it is necessary to allow the relief to flow more smoothly.Late Wednesday, armed men targeted the police officers protecting an aid convoy, said Adham Shuhaibar, a prominent trader licensed by Israel to bring goods and humanitarian supplies into Gaza. Ten of his trucks were damaged in the shootout, which caused at least a brief suspension of aid deliveries through Kerem Shalom, he said.Aid groups acknowledge that the task in front of them is daunting. More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in the fighting, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.Those who remain are malnourished, lacking shelter and are traumatized, still confined to the narrow strip of land where most signs of urban life have been decimated. So far, most of the aid has been food items, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which said an increase in medicines, shelter materials, and water and sanitation supplies is anticipated in the coming days.“Hunger and disease do not go away the moment the guns are silenced,” said Deepmala Mahla, chief humanitarian officer of CARE. “The health infrastructure, sanitation infrastructure, the road infrastructure … for us to take aid from one place to another is complicated. It’s difficult.”Some residents have expressed disappointment that they have yet to see food prices go down. “Yesterday, I bought a kilo of tomatoes for about 30 shekels, while before the war it was only three shekels,” Mohammad al-Ghraib, 42, said in a phone interview from Rafah. “There is a state of discontent and great shock among Palestinians.”Still, the surge in relief, if it continues, promises to transform the health and safety of residents, the vast majority of whom are displaced, including 1.6 million people who are living in makeshift shelters, according to Oxfam.At several points during the 15-month conflict, aid slowed to just a single-digit trickle of trucks each day, down from an average of 500 that entered daily before the war.The lack of food prompted the world’s leading body on hunger to warn of a looming famine. But COGAT, the Israeli government agency that oversees the Palestinian territories, placed the blame on the United Nations, arguing that it was logistical issues caused by the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestinian refugees.Aid groups argued instead that a lengthy and confusing inspection process, as well as Israel’s forced closure of the border crossing at Rafah between Egypt and Israel last May, was hindering free access.“For aid actors to be able to deliver, we need to see an end to the delays and denials impacting the humanitarian supply chain,” Gavin Kelleher, humanitarian access manager for Norwegian Refugee Council in Gaza, said as the negotiations for a ceasefire were underway last week.Under terms of the deal, Israel and Hamas agreed to a 42-day pause in fighting, during which the militants would release 33 of the Israeli hostages it abducted on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel will also release more than 730 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, mostly from the West Bank, as well as 1,100 residents of Gaza.As part of the agreement, Israel would allow food and other essential items to reach the territory. So far, 600 trucks entered on Sunday, followed by around 900 on both Monday and Tuesday and over 800 on Wednesday, according to OCHA figures. The higher numbers represent a more than 700 percent increase of the average daily trucks entering Gaza between Oct. 21, 2023, and Jan. 13, 2025, before the ceasefire.“The pipeline that is ready to come into Gaza is endless,” said Georgios Petropoulos, head of OCHA’s Gaza office. This week, OCHA published a map that indicated four crossings were open to humanitarian aid, including two in the north and one at the Netzarim Corridor, which bisects Gaza.Accounts from truck drivers who have been to border points both during the war and since the ceasefire started suggest that inspections have been significantly scaled back.Ibrahim Mohamed Ibrahim, 32, transported goods from Egypt to Gaza and said that it could previously take up to four hours just to get his vehicle into the crossing at Kerem Shalom — and then longer to have the goods scanned and unloaded.“Today, it took exactly one hour,” Ibrahim said Sunday.Amr Khaled, 20, gave a similar account. “The inspections are faster, and they are letting more trucks in,” he said.Petropoulos said that before the ceasefire, the private company that ran the border crossing at the Kerem Shalom crossing had stopped taking trucks at 4 p.m. Now trucks were driving through until 2 a.m. or later.“What’s changed is there’s been political decisions to let the U.N. and humanitarians to have the supplies they need to get to work,” Petropoulos said.Another key change is the absence of airstrikes, with aid workers saying they are able to move more freely without the fear of being targeted by Israeli bombardment. And until late Wednesday, humanitarian staff faced little if any threat from the criminal gangs looting aid in the south.Much of Gaza’s infrastructure, including roads, hospitals, water treatment plants and power lines, has been damaged or destroyed. The World Health Organization said it plans to bring in two sets of prefabricated, modular hospitals to help with the overwhelming medical needs.Health workers are no longer dealing with mass casualty events, now that the bombing has stopped. But many Gazans remain grievously wounded, stalked by disease and without key medications for chronic and other illnesses.“Everyone is confused, they don’t know how they feel,” said Nebal Farsakh, a West Bank-based spokeswoman for the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Some people are happy that they feel safe, she said, but “at the same time, it’s a lot of grief.”At least 377 aid workers, including 270 U.N. staff, have been killed in the war, OCHA said Wednesday. Among those were Red Cross volunteers and staff, Farsakh said.“All of them were killed while on duty,” she said. “But we need to keep going.”Mahfouz reported from Cairo, Harb from London and Taylor from Washington.
