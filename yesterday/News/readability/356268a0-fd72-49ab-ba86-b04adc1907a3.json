  "text": "Christal HayesBBC News, Los AngelesGetty ImagesBorder officers US President Donald Trump's administration has said it will revoke the temporary legal status of more than half a million migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.Migrants without a legal basis to remain have been warned to leave the country before their work permits and deportation shield are cancelled on 24 April, according to a notice posted by the federal government.The 530,000 migrants were brought into the US under a Biden-era sponsorship process known as CHNV that was designed to open legal migration pathways. Trump suspended the programme once he took office.It is unclear how many of these migrants have been able to secure another status in the interim that would allow them to stay in the US legally.The programme was launched under Democratic President Joe Biden in 2022, first covering Venezuelans before it was expanded to other countries. It allowed the migrants and their immediate family members to fly into the US if they had American sponsors and remain for two years under a temporary immigration status known as parole.The Biden administration had argued that CHNV would help curb illegal border crossings at the southern US border. But the Department of Homeland Security on Friday accused the previous administration of having lied to America.The agency's statement said Biden officials \"granted them [migrants] opportunities to compete for American jobs and undercut American workers; forced career civil servants to promote the programs even when fraud was identified; and then blamed Republicans in Congress for the chaos that ensued and the crime that followed\".However, the 35-page notice in the Federal Register said some of those in the US under CHNV might be allowed to remain on a \"case-by-case basis\". Trump is also considering whether to cancel the temporary legal status of some 240,000 Ukrainians who fled to the US during the conflict with Russia.",
