  "text": "Speculation is mounting within the White House regarding Stephen Miller, President Trump's senior policy and homeland security adviser, potentially succeeding Mike Waltz as national security adviser following recent administrative changes.The administration announced that Waltz, 51, would depart his National Security Council leadership role to become UN ambassador nominee. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, 53, has been appointed acting national security adviser, while Trump, 78, oversees the transition, New York Post reported.Administration insiders suggest Miller's candidacy stems from his strict immigration stance, which aligns with Trump's key policy priorities both domestically and internationally.\"He has been instrumental in the deportation effort and he and Rubio are aligned in stopping the cartels and the dictator regimes that they answer to, and he's probably the only one with the gravitas to actually finish the job,\" a source revealed to The Post.\"I think Stephen is beyond brilliant.\"Miller's prominent role during Trump's initial 100 days included regular media engagements at the White House briefing room and driveway press encounters.A White House insider noted, \"He would be an excellent choice. Not only is he great in policy but he knows how to manage government on a day-to-day basis. And he works well with Rubio, specifically on immigration and terror threat in the western hemisphere.\"However, another source questioned Miller's suitability, stating: \"It's too much of a full-time job [and] would take away from the things that he actually likes.\"Additional candidates include Michael Anton, White House policy planning director, reportedly favoured by Vice President JD Vance. Sebastian Gorka, senior counterterrorism director; Steve Witkoff, special Middle East envoy; and Ric Grenell, special envoy for special missions and former acting intelligence director and German ambassador under Trump, are also under consideration.",
