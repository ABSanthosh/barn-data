  "text": "Israel released 90 Palestinian prisoners and detainees early Monday, concluding the first, critical steps in a long-awaited ceasefire that included the return of three Israeli hostages and a halt to airstrikes on Gaza.Thousands of displaced Palestinians in parts of the besieged enclave began to return to their bombed-out neighborhoods and homes, some searching for the bodies of relatives. The first day of the truce also brought a surge of desperately needed humanitarian aid, with more than 630 trucks entering Gaza, according to U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher.The three female hostages — captured during Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel — were reunited with their families and determined to be in “a good state.” Thirty other hostages, most of whom are presumed to be alive, are slated to be gradually freed in releases every seven days as part of the first phase of the deal lasting 42 days. Hamas confirmed Monday in a statement that the next batch of hostages would be released next Saturday, Jan. 25.In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, large crowds gathered in Beitunia to welcome freed Palestinian prisoners and detainees, all of them women or teenagers. Prominent political activist Khalida Jarrar was among those freed, photos from news agencies showed.Here’s what else to knowPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated President Donald Trump for his inauguration in a video, saying, “Under your leadership, the best days of our alliance are yet to come.”Yemen’s Houthi rebels said in a statement they will limit attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea to Israeli-linked vessels now that a ceasefire in Gaza is in effect. While the group said it was “stopping sanctions” on other vessels — such as any heading toward Israeli ports — it left the door open to attacking American and British vessels if airstrikes against the Houthis continue.The mother of U.S. journalist Austin Tice, who was taken captive in Syria in 2012, met with Syrian interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa on Sunday. Photos of the meeting show his mother, Debra, sharing family photos of Austin with Sharaa, as part of her effort to learn more about the fate of her son.At least 46,913 people have been killed and 110,750 injured in Gaza since the war began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack, including more than 300 soldiers, and says 405 soldiers have been killed since the launch of its military operation in Gaza.Fifty-seven people are believed to remain hostage in Gaza, but Israel has not given the full basis for its estimates. Around 250 people were kidnapped on Oct. 7, of which around 120 have been freed so far and 74 have been confirmed killed.Live coverage contributors 11Who are the Israeli hostages released in the ceasefire with Hamas? Return to menuFreed hostages reunited with their mothers in an Israeli army facility on Jan. 19, after Hamas released them. (Video: Israel Defense Forces)Hamas released three Israeli hostages from captivity in the Gaza Strip, and Israel released 90 Palestinian prisoners, on the first day of a long-awaited ceasefire agreement that went into effect more than 15 months into the war.Romi Gonen, 24Gonen was attending the Nova music festival in southern Israel when Palestinian militants attacked and kidnapped her as she tried to escape, according to Israeli news outlets. Reuters reported that she is a dancer.Gonen’s mother, Meirav Leshem Gonen, posted Sunday on Facebook that she was taking “a moment to breathe it in and believe in the reality” of her daughter’s release.Emily Damari, 28Damari was kidnapped from her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza in southern Israel when Hamas militants stormed across the Israeli border. She is a dual citizen of Israel and Britain.Damari’s family previously confirmed, via the Hostages Families Forum, that she lost two fingers on the day of her abduction after being shot at by members of Hamas. Her mother, Mandy, said she heard from hostages who were freed last year that her daughter was alive, and received one sign of her daughter’s life — but then, nothing.“Yesterday, I was finally able to give Emily the hug that I have been dreaming of,” her mother said in a statement Monday. “I am relieved to report that after her release, Emily is doing much better than any of us could ever have anticipated.”Still, she added, “as wonderful as it is to see Emily’s resilience, these are still early days.”Emily Damari posted on Instagram that she was “the happiest person in the world” and had “returned to my beloved life,” according to the Times of Israel.Doron Steinbrecher, 31Steinbrecher, a veterinary nurse with dual Romanian-Israeli citizenship, was taken from her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza. That day, she had called her mother, Simona, and said she was hiding under her bed because someone had broken into her room, her mother said in an editorial for the Financial Times.“Ten minutes later, she sent a voice message to her friends — a message that said only one thing: ‘They’ve got me, they’ve got me,’” her mother wrote.On Sunday, Steinbrecher’s family said in a statement: “After an unbearable 471 days, our beloved Dodo has finally returned to our arms.” They said Steinbrecher would begin her “rehabilitation journey” and urged officials to do everything they can to secure the release of the remaining hostages.This is an excerpt from a full story.In photos: The scene in Gaza on the second day of the ceasefireReturn to menuThe day after the ceasefire in Gaza went into force, displaced Palestinians began treks through the rubble back to the homes they had left behind. Many of the 1.9 million displaced Gazans don’t have houses to return to: More than half of all homes in Gaza have been damaged by the war.Nourhan Attallah, 25, who was training as a pharmacist before the war broke out, said she has mixed feelings about the ceasefire.“Happy because no more people gonna die,” she said, but sad because of how many Gazans lost their homes and are starting their lives over from scratch. “The war doesn’t end yet, until rebuilding,” she said.Nourhan said she worries “about my future, my family future, where should we leave and when.”Gazans grapple with uncertain futures as ceasefire holdsReturn to menuJERUSALEM — Since the ceasefire began, Reem, a mother in Gaza City, is back to sleeping in her room, and not the staircase where her family huddled at night in case their apartment was hit again.“The most basic thing is there is no killing of people,” she told The Washington Post by phone. “No sound of explosions and strikes.”She hopes it will continue — but cannot shake the fear that fighting will resume. “It’s hard, politically and militarily, to expect it to succeed,” she said. “God willing, it will.”Reem is on leave from her job at the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, which aids Palestinian refugees. She spoke using only her first name as she is not authorized to speak to media.Reem’s family was able to remain in their home, though one room is unusable after an airstrike. If an Israeli law banning UNRWA goes into effect this month, she will lose her salary. Her husband, a professor, has not worked since the war began.“We are sitting and waiting,” she said.Fadi Abu Riyala, a nurse displaced in Bureij, in central Gaza, is awaiting the ceasefire’s seventh day, when residents of the north will be allowed to return. The family’s house in Gaza City, he has been told, is still standing, though it is missing walls. The family will return — except for his son, who was killed in the war and is buried in Bureij.“The sadness and pain that is in us is huge,” he told The Post by phone. “It can’t be stated or described or written.”Wissam, another Gazan, walked more than two hours Monday from his tent in Mawasi, on the central coast, to his house in Rafah, in the far south. Or what was left of his house and his city.“Everything is destroyed,” he told The Post by phone. “There is no tree, no stone, no person. Rafah is not livable at all.”Israel military tanks are still stationed in the area. Wissam spoke using only his first name for security reasons.Now, his family is stuck. Previously, displaced people would stay in other displaced people’s empty homes — but those are starting to fill back up as Gazans return to their houses amid the ceasefire. Wissam can’t afford to travel elsewhere, and nothing salvageable remains of his family home.“Where would I go?” he said.Joy and grief as returning Gazans find communities smashed to rubbleReturn to menuDisplaced Palestinians walked down rubble-strewn roads in Jabalya on Jan. 20, a day after the long-awaited ceasefire in Gaza began. (Video: Reuters)JERUSALEM — The skies over Gaza finally went quiet for the first time in 14 months Sunday as a fragile ceasefire took hold.The whine of Israeli drones — the soundtrack of more than a year of war — receded. Hamas fighters emerged into the daylight, wearing masks and wielding guns atop pickup trucks, to the cheers of civilians. Displaced Gazans marched in the thousands down dusty roads from makeshift shelters to the hometowns they had fled as the Israeli army advanced.Drone footage shot on Jan. 19 reveals extensive destruction in Gaza's Jabalya refugee camp, with people walking through leveled buildings. (Video: Reuters)Joy mingled with grief as Gazans began to confront the scale of the loss: Homes reduced to rubble. The bodies of loved ones still buried under the debris. Whole communities flattened. And scars, visible and not, from the war’s human toll: More than 46,900 dead and 110,750 injured, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but says the majority of the dead are women and children.This is an excerpt from a full story.Families reunited with loved ones released from Ofer Prison Return to menuBEITUNIA, West Bank — Nawaf Jarabaa, 63, and more than 10 relatives waited in the cold Sunday night for his daughter, Shatha, 24, to be released from Ofer Prison.Families began arriving in Beitunia in the occupied West Bank around 4 p.m., the earliest the prisoner releases could begin under the terms of the deal. One of Nawaf’s sons stationed himself near the prison so he could keep his father abreast of any move.Finally, shortly before 2 a.m. local time, crowds cheered and fireworks cracked as two buses from the prison reached the square crowded with families.Young men jumped on the buses and waved Palestinian and Hamas flags, as well as ones for Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah.Palestinian prisoners released by Israel as part of the Gaza ceasefire deal were welcomed by cheering crowds in the occupied West Bank on Jan. 20. (Video: Reuters)Shatha shrieked with joy as she embraced her father in a long hug. His eyes teared up.She and a brother were arrested in August on charges of incitement on social media, Nawaf said. Another son was detained a year ago, he said. All three were detained after Oct. 7, 2023.The father said his children were expressing their anger at Israel’s conduct in the Gaza war on Facebook.“I am happy but only a little bit,” he said of her release, because his other two children remained imprisoned.The family lives in the village of Beitin outside of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.Another prisoner who was released at the same time, Ahmed Khisham, 18, wore a gray Israel Prisons Service sweatshirt.He was jailed in late January of 2024 after Israeli forces came to arrest his brother, who was armed. His brother was killed in a subsequent gun battle and Israeli forces arrested Khisham instead, he said.The teen was released during the November 2023 week-long humanitarian pause only to be arrested again.Khisham described the violence he faced in jail. He said he was frequently handcuffed and beaten. Last Friday, he said, IPS raided his block with tear gas and beat the prisoners.“They tortured us,” he said. “They have done the undoable.”Aid groups rush supplies into Gaza: ‘There is no time to lose’Return to menuAid groups on Sunday scrambled to deliver desperately needed supplies into Gaza in the first hours of the ceasefire, seizing a rare moment of peace in a 15-month war that has killed humanitarian workers and devastated civilians.More than 630 aid trucks entered the Gaza Strip on Sunday, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, with at least 300 of them diverted north, an area aid workers have largely been unable to access and where conditions have become particularly dire.“There is no time to lose. After 15 months of relentless war, the humanitarian needs are staggering,” U.N. humanitarian affairs chief Tom Fletcher said in a release. “This is a moment of tremendous hope — fragile, yet vital — as we continue to navigate the complexities of the days and weeks ahead,” he added.Trucks loaded with humanitarian aid lined up on the Egyptian side of the Gaza border in Rafah on Jan. 19, waiting to be surged into Gaza during the ceasefire. (Video: Reuters)Video footage posted by Cindy McCain, executive director of the World Food Program, showed dozens of tractor trailer trucks loaded with what appeared to be hundreds of sacks of flour destined for Gaza.“Humanitarian aid workers MUST be protected,” she wrote on X, adding, “We are hopeful to maintain access at scale.”The World Health Organization said Sunday that it’s “scaling up operations and mobilizing critical supplies” for delivery into Gaza. It also plans to carry out a 60-day plan to rapidly restore and expand Gaza’s obliterated health care system, which has dwindled to a handful of operational hospitals with limited supplies amid Israeli raids on health facilities.“Addressing the massive health needs and restoring the health system in Gaza will be a complex and challenging task, given the scale of destruction, operational complexity and constraints involved,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on social media.WHO is working to increase youth and infant food programs, increase medical evacuations out of Gaza and carry out wider spread immunization campaigns to help blunt “the high level of malnutrition and disease outbreaks” ravaging the Strip, it said. UNICEF also wrote on social media Sunday that it had delivered water, hygiene kits and food products into Gaza, calling the ceasefire a “critical first step” that “must be upheld.”Middle East conflict Israel released 90 Palestinian prisoners and detainees early Monday, concluding the first, critical steps in a long-awaited ceasefire. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel’s creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon. Israel’s airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel’s founding.Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century’s most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations’ ceasefire resolutions.Live briefing: Three Israeli hostages and 90 Palestinians freed as Gaza ceasefire takes holdMonitoring the status of hostages still in Gaza after Hamas’s attackWho are the Israeli hostages released in the ceasefire with Hamas?",
