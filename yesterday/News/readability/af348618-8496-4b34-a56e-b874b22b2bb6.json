The scene began with Trump advising Rubio to stay on good terms with Musk.\"Marco, thank you so much for coming. I know you're under a lot of stress, but I can't have you fighting with Elon,\" Johnson's who played Trump said.Trump, Musk and Rubio Meeting Cold Open - SNL\"I need you to be my good little Marco,\" he continued, suggesting Marco's name would become \"Mark Ruby\" after establishing English as the official language. \"If you think I'm going to stand here and let you call me that, you're right\" Hernandez responded. \"But what I don't accept is Elon having total access to our government,\" he continued. \"Planes are crashing, and he keeps trying to fire air traffic controllers,\" he added.Johnson's character proceeded to support Musk.\"Elon has been doing a good job with DOGE and he gave me some great stuff to talk about at State of the Union,\" Johnson's character stated.Myers appeared in formal attire, reflecting Musk's actual appearance during the meeting. Critics had previously criticised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for casual dress during his Oval Office meeting with Trump, although Musk rarely wears formal attire in Trump's presence.\"Elon, I want to thank you for at least wearing a suit this time,\" Johnson said. \"Doesn't look great, right?\" he added.Addressing both individuals, Johnson's attempted reconciliation. \"I can't have you two at each other's throats. OK, after all, I have a perfect record. Everyone who's ever worked for me has left on good terms and then gone on to write a book called The Man Who Ruined Everything,\" he said.\"Marco, get your budget under control,\" Johnson said. \"Elon, stay in your lane. You're not the boss,\" he added. \"But I paid you $300 million,\" Myers's playing Musk said, alluding to the billionaires substantial contributions to Trump's campaign and MAGA supporters.\"And that's why you're the boss,\" Johnson concluded. \"We'll get out of your office.\" The performance has generated diverse reactions online, with some appreciating the satire whilst others found it lacking humour.",
