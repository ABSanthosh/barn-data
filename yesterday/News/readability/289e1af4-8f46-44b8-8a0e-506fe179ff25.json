  "text": "Commonwealth members have appointed Ghana’s foreign minister, Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, as the new secretary general, on the final day of the group’s summit in Samoa.Botchwey, a former lawmaker who has served as Ghana’s foreign minister since 2017, has supported calls for reparations for transatlantic slavery and colonialism – a position that was also shared by the two other candidates who had vied for the position.Botchwey said on social media that she was “truly humbled” to have been selected as the incoming secretary general, adding: “The work indeed lies ahead!”Botchwey was appointed on the closing day of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm), which has been dominated by calls for the UK to pay reparations for its role in the transatlantic slave trade, and by issues relating to the climate crisis.In a communique released on Saturday, heads of government noted “calls for discussions on reparatory justice with regard to the transatlantic trade in enslaved Africans and chattel enslavement” and “agreed that the time has come for a meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation towards forging a common future based on equity.”It is unclear what form this conversation will take. The UK government refused to issue an official state apology for its role in the slave trade and has ruled out paying reparations. However, after mounting pressure, a source in No 10 said this week the UK could support some forms of reparatory justice, such as restructuring financial institutions and providing debt relief.At a debate at London’s Chatham House last month, Botchwey said she stood for reparations, and that the Commonwealth could have a role to play if the member states request a “common voice” on the issue.She said reparatory justice was not only about financial payments but also support to tackle the climate crisis and build countries’ economic resilience.Botchwey has also backed the drafting of a free trade agreement among Commonwealth member states.Botchwey, who studied in Ghana and the UK, is a trained lawyer and politician. As foreign minister, she chaired the council of ministers of the 15-member economic Community of West African states (Ecowas) and steered Ghana’s two-year tenure on the UN security council, which ended in December 2023.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThe secretary general is nominated by Commonwealth leaders and can serve a maximum of two terms of four years each.Botchwey takes over from Patricia Scotland, who has held the position since 2016.
