  "text": "Justin Trudeau (File photo: AP)Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is reportedly considering stepping down amid growing speculation over his political future and a deepening crisis within the Liberal Party. According to trading platform Polymarket, there is now an 80% chance Trudeau will resign before April, as calls for his departure intensify among Canadian leaders and his own party.Besides, according to the sources by CTV News, Trudeau is weighing his options, including resignation or proroguing Parliament, with an announcement expected soon.Trudeau reportedly informed his cabinet and MPs about his intentions to address the situation, following the abrupt resignation of finance minister Chrystia Freeland, which has deepened the instability within his administration.Freeland accused the Prime Minister of engaging in \"costly political gimmicks\" for personal benefit rather than addressing Canada’s mounting economic challenges.Liberal MPs call emergency meetingOn Monday night, Liberal MPs called an emergency caucus meeting, boarding up the room to keep proceedings behind closed doors. Trudeau was seen attending the meeting, according to CTV News. The Prime Minister has yet to publicly comment on Freeland’s resignation or the mounting pressure to step aside.The dramatic events follow weeks of criticism from opposition parties and within Trudeau’s own ranks. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre intensified his attacks, calling Trudeau’s leadership “out of control.” Poilievre’s remarks resonate as Trudeau lags 20 points behind the Conservatives in national polls.Dalhousie University professor Lori Turnbull described the situation as “a total disaster” for the Liberal Party. “It makes it much harder for Trudeau to continue as prime minister,” she added.Freeland’s resignation rocks Trudeau’s cabinetChrystia Freeland, Canada's deputy prime minister and finance minister, announced her resignation, citing irreconcilable differences with Trudeau on the country’s future. In her resignation letter, Freeland revealed that Trudeau had expressed intentions to replace her and offered another cabinet role, which she declined.“Upon reflection, I have concluded that the only honest and viable path is for me to resign,” Freeland stated. She pointed to weeks of disagreements and a lack of alignment with Trudeau on critical policy issues.Freeland's resignation comes amid Trudeau's declining popularity and growing dissent within the Liberal Party. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre seized the moment, declaring that “Canada is out of control” under Trudeau’s leadership.What is Prorogation?Prorogation, a procedural tool in parliamentary systems, terminates a session of Parliament at the recommendation of the Prime Minister. This measure essentially “resets” legislative proceedings, halting all pending bills and committee activities until a new session begins. While often used to refocus government priorities, it can also serve as a political strategy during periods of instability.Growing criticism and party divisionsFreeland’s resignation underscores the mounting challenges Trudeau faces, including internal divisions and external crises like a trade war with the United States. In her resignation, Freeland warned of looming fiscal challenges and criticized “costly political gimmicks” aimed at boosting the Liberals’ waning fortunes.Party leader Jagmeet Singh had earlier been less equivocal when asked about bringing down Trudeau, whom he insisted should resign.Lori Turnbull, a professor at Dalhousie University, described Freeland’s exit as “a total disaster” for Trudeau. “It shows a crisis of confidence in his leadership,” she said, adding that the cabinet’s unity is now in question.Despite calls for a reset, Trudeau’s office dismissed rumors of his resignation, stating they are “absolutely not accurate.” However, with Finance Minister Sean Fraser also resigning and growing opposition from both his party and rivals, Trudeau’s path forward remains uncertain.The political landscape remains volatile, with the next parliamentary election expected by October 2025. Freeland has announced her intention to run, while Trudeau has maintained his plan to lead the Liberals into the next election.",
