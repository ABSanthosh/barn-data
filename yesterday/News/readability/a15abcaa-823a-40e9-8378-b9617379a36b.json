  "text": "US President Donald Trump on Tuesday claimed that Israel had agreed to the key terms of a proposed 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, raising hopes for a temporary halt to the ongoing conflict that has killed over 58,000 Palestinians since October 2023.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, “My Representatives had a long and productive meeting with the Israelis today on Gaza. Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions to finalize the 60 Day CEASEFIRE, during which time we will work with all parties to end the War. The Qataris and Egyptians, who have worked very hard to help bring Peace, will deliver this final proposal. I hope, for the good of the Middle East, that Hamas takes this Deal, because it will not get better — IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”Trump’s statement comes amid rising international pressure to stop the violence, which began after the October 7, 2023, attacks when Hamas gunmen stormed southern Israel, killing over 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. Israel responded with a large-scale military offensive that has devastated much of the Gaza Strip.Trump did not clarify the exact terms of the proposed truce. However, he suggested that the ceasefire would provide a window to negotiate a broader end to the war, with Qatar and Egypt playing a key role in delivering the final offer to Hamas.Talks around the ceasefire have been ongoing in recent weeks, with the US, Qatar and Egypt mediating between the two sides. While some reports suggest that Hamas is demanding stronger guarantees around Israeli troop withdrawal and aid access, Israel has insisted on the release of hostages as a key condition.Trump’s announcement also comes at a time when tensions have been escalating between Iran and Israel, following tit-for-tat strikes earlier this month. The US also joined the assault by dropping bombs on Iran's top nuclear sites, which was condemned by Supreme Leader Khamenei.",
