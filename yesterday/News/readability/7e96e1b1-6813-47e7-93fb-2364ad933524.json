  "text": "Shaquille O'Neal doesn't just sign checks—he signs up for investments that align with his values, a lesson he credits to Jeff Bezos. The four-time NBA champion and business mogul says his financial success skyrocketed once he started using the Amazon founder's approach to investing. O'Neal in 2019 told The Wall Street Journal, \"I heard Jeff Bezos say one time [that] he makes his investments based on if it's going to change people's lives. Once I started doing that strategy, I think I probably quadrupled what I'm worth.\" Don't Miss: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. The $1.3 Billion Startup Investment Boom: How This Company's Explosive Growth Is Opening Doors For Everyday Investors With A New $500 Minimum For O'Neal, this philosophy goes beyond just writing checks to the hottest startups. If he doesn't personally believe in a business, it doesn't matter how great the numbers look—he won't touch it. \"Whenever I do business, it's not about the money,\" he said. O'Neal's approach has led to some impressive wins. He was an early investor in Google and has since built a diverse portfolio, with stakes in Apple, car washes, and Las Vegas nightclubs. But his investment in home security company Ring, is one of his biggest success stories. He discovered the company while looking for an affordable security solution for his own home. After trying it, he was convinced—and rather than just buying the product, he decided to invest. That bet paid off when Amazon acquired Ring for $1 billion in 2018. Trending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. Not every investment sticks. At one point, O'Neal owned 17 Auntie Anne's pretzel franchises, but he eventually sold them off after realizing they didn't align with his values. \"I had to ask myself: Do I really believe in this? The answer was no, so I let them go,\" he explained. On the other hand, Krispy Kreme remains one of his favorite investments—mainly because he's been obsessed with the brand since college. \"Krispy Kreme is a fabulous donut. I was introduced to it in college and have been in love with it ever since,\" he told The Journal.",
