  "text": "JERUSALEM — Dozens of armed Israeli settlers attacked two Palestinian villages in the occupied West Bank late Wednesday, setting homes ablaze and sparking a confrontation with Palestinian residents that drew in Israeli security forces, according to local Palestinian authorities and the Israel Defense Forces.Three Palestinians were killed in Kafr Malik, the Palestinian Health Ministry said, though it was not immediately clear whether it was the Israeli soldiers or settlers who were responsible for the fatal shots. In the nearby village of Taybeh, vigilantes speaking Hebrew were filmed setting fire to a vehicle earlier Wednesday, according to Israeli rights group B’Tselem, which acquired the video.CCTV footage verified by The Washington Post showed Israeli settlers attacking Palestinian villages in the West Bank on June 25. (Video: B’Tselem via AP)The deadly clash in Kafr Malik was the latest instance of armed settlers carrying out violent raids against Palestinian villages in the West Bank, often with impunity in the presence of Israeli soldiers or directly with their help. Internal Israeli military data showed that crimes committed by soldiers and settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank during the first two months of 2025 surged 30 percent compared with a year earlier, the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported in March, citing Israeli security officials who were concerned by the uptick.The IDF said in a statement that its soldiers were dispatched to quell a confrontation between settlers and Palestinians but were attacked by rocks and “fire” from “terrorists” inside the village. Troops “opened fire toward the source of fire and the rock-hurlers” and later found that several people were injured and killed, the IDF said, adding that soldiers arrested five Israelis and turned them over to the Israeli police.Kafr Malik’s mayor, Najeh Daoud, told The Washington Post that settlers carrying M-16 rifles and molotov cocktails arrived around 7 p.m. local time and burned four cars. When they tried to approach homes to set them ablaze, they were surrounded by local Palestinians, he said. Soon after that, the IDF arrived and fired tear gas to disperse the clashing crowds, Daoud said.“Then, the soldiers started shooting live ammunition at the residents, who were civilians who came to stop the fire and to defend their village with rocks and sticks,” said Daoud, who disputed the IDF’s claim that Palestinians fired guns at soldiers and accused the IDF soldiers of killing the three people.A series of videos verified by the Associated Press show some of the violence in Kafr Malik late Wednesday, including one that shows a house on fire in the village while men are seen running away and gunfire can be heard in the distance. In another, a car is engulfed in flames, and a man tries to pour water on the fire. What sounds like a single gunshot is captured in the footage, followed by screams.A third video recorded on Thursday shows damaged property, including charred vehicles and a house.The five Israelis who were arrested were released Thursday morning after being cleared of any suspicion, Israeli media reported, citing the police. A spokesman for the Israeli police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The law enforcement agency, which is led by Israel’s far-right minister of national security and settler leader Itamar Ben Gvir, has jurisdiction over settlers living in the West Bank, while the IDF is responsible for overall public safety in the occupied territory.The Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah said that apart from the three killed, seven others were injured by bullets from settlers and “Israeli occupation forces,” reported WAFA, the official Palestinian news agency.Palestinian officials condemned the incident.“The orgy and violence of settlers under the protection of the occupation army is a political decision by the Israeli government implemented by the settlers,” Palestinian Vice President Hussein al-Sheikh said.Violence has rocked the West Bank since Oct 7. 2023, when Hamas and its Palestinian supporters in Gaza poured into southern Israel, killing about 1,200 Israeli civilians and taking 251 hostages.The clash that killed three in Kafr Malik on Wednesday evening came days after residents accused the IDF of fatally shooting Moataz Aamar Hamayel, a 13-year-old boy from the same village. In response to a question about Hamayel’s death, the IDF said that “terrorists” threw stones at passing cars and soldiers, who acted “in accordance with the rules of engagement and responded with fire to remove the imminent threat.” The incident is under examination, the IDF said.On Tuesday night, settlers also set Palestinian homes on fire in Masafer Yatta, south of Hebron, according to the Israeli human rights group Standing Together.From Oct. 7, 2023, until Wednesday night, Israeli forces have killed at least 918 Palestinians in the West Bank, including at least 193 minors, according to B’Tselem. At least 24 more Palestinians were killed by Israeli settlers or Israelis of unclear affiliation, the group said.Brian Perlman in Washington contributed to this report.",
