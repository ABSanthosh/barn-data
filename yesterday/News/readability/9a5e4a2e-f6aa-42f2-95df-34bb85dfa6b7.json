  "text": "Here are the latest developments.The rebels who ended the Assad family’s brutal rule in Syria began asserting control over the capital on Monday, with fighters taking up positions outside public buildings and directing traffic in a show of their newly claimed authority.Major questions remained unanswered, including who would lead the new government, as millions of Syrians and the wider world struggled to process the stunning end to the Assads’ decades-long reign, opposition activists sought to return from exile and foreign governments weighed how to deal with rebels they once designated as extremists and terrorists.Euphoria around the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad over the weekend mixed with uncertainty about the future of country and the intentions of the rebel group that now holds the capital, Damascus, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (Organization for the Liberation of the Levant). Syrians who had fled their country’s 13-year civil war clogged the roads from Turkey and Lebanon to return home, as did people who had been displaced within the country.But some who had supported the Assad government fear they could face retribution. And on Monday, there were early signs of the lawlessness — broken windows of cars and shops — that many fear could spiral and grip the country. New York Times reporters entering Syria on Monday via Lebanon saw abandoned Syrian military tanks, empty checkpoints and ripped-up posters of Mr. al-Assad littering the main highway to the capital, Damascus.Hayat Tahrir al-Sham is led by an Islamist leader, Ahmed al-Shara, formerly known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani. It now faces the complex task of extending control over a country with deep ethnic, sectarian and religious divisions. The group’s military leadership said in a statement on Telegram that its forces were “about to finish controlling the capital and preserving public property,” and that a new government would begin work “immediately” after being formed. It did not specify who would lead the new government.Here’s what to know:Prisons: Hundreds of Syrians were rushing on Monday to Sednaya Prison, a complex near Damascus notorious for torture and executions, in the hopes of finding missing loved ones. Israel: After sending its forces into Syrian territory over the weekend, Israel continued to strike targets in Syria. In a letter to the U.N. Security Council, Israel’s ambassador labeled recent developments in Syria a threat to Israel’s security and said that its military would “continue to act as necessary.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised briefing on Monday that Israel was willing to work with the new government. “We want to see a different Syria,” he said. “For our benefit, and for the benefit of the people of Syria.”Al-Assad in Russia: Moscow will not disclose Mr. al-Assad’s location in Russia, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told Russian news agencies on Monday. He added that President Vladimir V. Putin had made the decision to offer exile to Mr. al-Assad and his family, but that there were no immediate plans for the men to meet.Arab pivot: Arab nations had been working hard to bring Mr. al-Assad back into the fold, assuming he was there to stay. They now find themselves thinking through the implications of a post-Assad world in the Middle East, where Iran’s influence is crumbling and the power of Turkey and Israel has been enhanced.A Syrian volunteer rescue group, the White Helmets, said that its specialized teams had finished searching for detainees at “the infamous Sednaya Prison” in Damascus but had found no hidden areas. In a statement, the group said, “We share the profound disappointment of the families of the thousands who remain missing and whose fates remain unknown.”The rebel authorities released a statement through their political affairs department urging Syrians forced out of the country to “return and contribute to building the future.” The statement promised efforts “to address the effects of the past through transparent mechanisms aimed at achieving lasting peace and restoring the social fabric,” and pledged that “the new Syria” would nurture “dignity and justice and institutions that reflect the aspirations of the Syrian people.”VideoRebel forces released many detainees from the notorious Sednaya military prison in Damascus. The government complex has a long history of human rights abuses under the rule of fallen President Bashar al-Assad.CreditCredit...Daniel Berehulak/The New York TimesThe Justice Department charges two Syrian military officials with war crimes against Americans and others.ImageThe Mezzeh air base in Damascus, Syria, where two officials were accused of committing war crimes and running a notorious prison facility. Credit...Getty Images/Getty ImagesThe Justice Department has charged two top Syrian military officials with war crimes committed against Americans and others at a notorious prison in Damascus during the Syrian civil war, according to an indictment unsealed on Monday.The indictment represents the first time the United States has criminally charged top Syrian officials with a litany of human rights abuses used to silence dissent and spread fear through the country. The whereabouts of the officials, Jamil Hassan and Abdul Salam Mahmoud, are not known, but the indictment clearly signals that the United States aims to hold to account those who were at the highest echelons of the Syrian government.Mr. Hassan, who was the head of the Air Force Intelligence Directorate, and Mr. Mahmoud, a brigadier general in the Air Force’s intelligence unit, “sought to terrify, intimidate and repress any opposition, or perceived opposition, to the regime,” according to the indictment, which was filed under seal last month in federal court in Chicago.The indictment was made public the day after Syrian rebels overthrew the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Mr. Hassan and Mr. Mahmoud would need to be flown to federal court in Chicago to stand trial, but the charges provide the legal mechanism for American law enforcement to take custody of the men, if they can be found.Mr. al-Assad, an authoritarian leader known for his brutal tactics during a 13-year civil war, has already fled to Russia, which, along with Iran, had helped keep him in power.As top leaders under Mr. al-Assad, Mr. Hassan oversaw a crackdown on Syrian citizens in which a ruthless system of detention and torture flourished, and Mr. Mahmoud, as a brigadier general in the Air Force Intelligence unit, was in charge of the prison at the military air base in the Mezzeh neighborhood of Damascus as well as operations at the base.Along with unnamed co-conspirators, Mr. Hassan and Mr. Mahmoud “committed the war crime of knowingly and intentionally conspiring to commit cruel and inhuman treatment,” according to the indictment. The men intended to inflict “serious physical abuse upon victims within their custody or control, namely U.S. citizens and other detainees” held at the Mezzeh prison, where investigators said both men had offices.The indictment describes the torture that Syrian military officials doled out from 2012 to 2019. That included electrocution and pulling out the toenails of prisoners, as well as burning them with acid and regularly beating them.The men were instrumental in helping Mr. Assad silence dissent, using torture — and fear of it — to maintain his government for more than a decade. His rule came to an end days ago, when rebels seized the country’s largest city, Aleppo, and the capital, Damascus, and toppled Mr. Assad’s government. The rebels freed prisoners in the country, many of them thought to be innocent civilians.Both Mr. Hassan and Mr. Mahmoud are well known to human rights advocates and the American government. In 2012, the United States imposed sanctions on Mr. al-Assad and his inner circle, including Mr. Hassan, for committing acts of violence against civilians.In mid-November, three days before a grand jury returned the indictment against the men, the State Department said that it had restricted Mr. Mahmoud’s ability to travel “due to his involvement in gross violations of human rights, namely torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”A spokesman for the Chicago U.S. attorney’s office did not respond to a request for comment about why prosecutors waited more than 20 days to unseal the indictment.Prosecutors in Chicago have been investigating Mr. Hassan and others since 2018, when the Justice Department opened a case related to the detention and killing of an American aid worker named Layla Shweikani. F.B.I. agents traveled to Europe and the Middle East to interview witnesses, including the man who may have buried Ms. Shweikani.The indictment does not name Ms. Shweikani, who was held imprisoned on the outskirts of Damascus for nearly a year at three detention facilities known for their use of torture: a facility at the Mezzeh airport, the Adra civilian prison and the Sednaya military prison.Dina Kash, an F.B.I. witness who was detained at Mezzeh prison, said in an interview that investigators wanted names of fellow detainees and information about how they were treated. Syrian guards beat her, knocking out her teeth. She was forced to listen to the screams of other prisoners being tortured. Guards killed her husband.“The investigators focused on the people that interrogated me and the Assad regime, intelligence operatives and officials that were involved in my family’s arrest, including Hassan,” Ms. Kash said.Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, said now was the time for the United States to hold responsible those officials who had subjected American citizens and countless others to detention and torture. “Now it is our time to catch these criminals and bring them to the United States for trial,” said Mr. Moustafa, who added that he was traveling to Syria to help law enforcement agencies gather human remains and documents from the prisons.The director of the F.B.I., Christopher A. Wray, in a statement, vowed to hold the men to account. “Hassan and Mahmoud allegedly oversaw the systematic use of cruel and inhumane treatment on perceived enemies of the Syrian regime, including American citizens,” he said.The indictment does not mention Austin Tice, an American abducted in Syria in 2012. Syria never acknowledged holding Mr. Tice, but American officials are hopeful that he survived what would have amounted to a grueling stretch inside the prison system.American officials are confident that Mr. Tice was held by the Syrians early in his abduction. Investigators learned that he had initially been taken to a prison in Damascus and was seen by a doctor, according to two people familiar with the matter. Mr. Tice managed to escape for about a week but was recaptured, the people said.In May, U.S. officials informed the family of Majd Kamalmaz, a therapist from Texas, that he died in Syria after disappearing there in 2017. Like the case of Mr. Tice, Syria never acknowledged holding Mr. Kamalmaz, and there was little information about his whereabouts.Mr. Moustafa said he and his research team strongly suspected that Mr. Kamalmaz was imprisoned, at least for some of his time in Syria, at the Mezzeh air base.The Biden administration is relying on Turkey to communicate with the rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.ImageU.S. officials say they are closely watching to see whether Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, led by Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, displays traits of a terrorist group or whether it has changed.Credit...Aref Tammawi/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe Biden administration is scrambling to find ways to engage with groups in Syria and around the Middle East as victorious militias begin shaping the nation’s future after the toppling of President Bashar al-Assad, the longtime autocrat.The informal diplomacy during this risky period has to take place through channels outside Syria because the United States closed its embassy in Damascus in 2012 and has no known diplomatic personnel there. The State Department maintains a Syria office in its mission in Turkey, whose government has built close ties to various Syrian militias, including the most powerful one, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.Facing a new 11th-hour Middle East crisis before leaving power, the Biden administration hopes to keep the lid on a Pandora’s box of threats that could emerge from a post-Assad Syria. Among them are a resurgence of anti-American terrorists, new dangers for neighboring Israel and a spasm of violence that could drive more refugees from the country.U.S. officials have been speaking to their counterparts in Turkey in recent days. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken talked with Hakan Fidan, the foreign minister of Turkey and a former intelligence chief, on Saturday as the militias were moving quickly toward Damascus, the capital of Syria.Mr. Blinken “emphasized the importance of protecting civilians, including members of minority groups, across Syria,” according to a State Department summary of the call.It was clear Mr. Blinken intended for Mr. Fidan to convey that message to the militias.ImageCelebrating the fall of the Assad government in Bar Elias, Lebanon, near the Syrian border, on Sunday.Credit...Daniel Berehulak/The New York TimesWhile the United States sees Turkey as a potentially helpful partner, given its close rebel ties, Biden officials are also wary of its intentions toward U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters who have battled the Islamic State in northeastern Syria.On Sunday, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III spoke with his Turkish counterpart, Yasar Guler, in part “to avoid any risk to U.S. forces and partners, and the Defeat-ISIS Mission,” according to a summary of the call from the Pentagon.The conversation followed Turkish attacks on the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces that the group said killed at least 22 of its members. Turkish officials say those Kurdish fighters are aligned with Kurdish nationalist militants inside their country.The Biden administration is intensifying talks over Syria with other allies in the region.The White House said on Monday that Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, would fly to Israel this week to speak to officials there about the related situations in Gaza, Syria, Lebanon and Iran.The rapid fall of the Assad government surprised both Israel and the United States. Israeli troops crossed into Syria over the weekend and quickly bolstered defenses in the Golan Heights, which Israel had annexed from Syria. Israel also conducted airstrikes on chemical weapons stockpiles in Syria, Israeli officials said.The State Department spokesman, Matthew Miller, told reporters on Monday that Biden officials “have a number of ways of communicating” with rebel leaders — “sometimes directly with various groups, sometimes with intermediaries, either inside Syria or outside Syria.”Roger D. Carstens, the U.S. special envoy for hostage affairs, is already in Beirut as part of a renewed effort to win the freedom of Austin Tice, an American journalist who disappeared in Syria in 2012 and whom President Biden believes to be alive.Mr. Carstens’s mission is “to find out where Austin Tice is and get him home as soon as possible,” Mr. Miller said.“We have reason to believe that he is alive,” Mr. Miller said, without providing details.ImageSyrians on Monday at Sednaya, the Assad government’s most notorious prison, where thousands of political prisoners were held.Credit...Daniel Berehulak/The New York TimesThe United States has been wary of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and its 42-year-old leader, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, ever since President Barack Obama designated its earlier incarnation a terrorist group. U.S. officials say they are closely watching to see whether the organization displays traits of a terrorist group or whether it has changed.“We will be closely monitoring developments as they unfold and engaging with our partners in the region,” Mr. Blinken said in a statement on Sunday. “We have taken note of statements made by rebel leaders in recent days, but as they take on greater responsibility, we will assess not just their words, but their actions.” He specifically cited respect for human rights and the protection of civilian noncombatants.David Lammy, the foreign secretary of Britain, said the same thing on Monday. At least one British cabinet official has suggested his government could lift its terrorist designation on the group under the right circumstances.The U.S. process for a full lifting of the same designation could take weeks or months, once a decision is made.A senior U.S. official said on Sunday that it was too early to discuss whether the United States might remove its sanctions on Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. But the official suggested, in an echo of Mr. Blinken’s statement, that the group would have to earn such a reprieve with tangible action.Colin P. Clarke, a counterterrorism analyst at the Soufan Group, a security consulting firm based in New York, called any softening of the U.S. position toward Mr. Jolani “a huge risk.”“Jolani has done an amazing job at rehabbing his image; he’s presenting himself as a modern-day revolutionary cut from the same cloth as Che Guevara, and this is resonating in many parts of the Middle East and further abroad,” Mr. Clarke said. “However, under his rule, northwestern Syria has still been a harsh place where critics are silenced, tortured, jailed and disappeared.”ImageAn abandoned border checkpoint in Masnaa, Syria.Credit...Daniel Berehulak/The New York TimesHe noted that the United States still maintains a bounty of up to $10 million on Mr. Jolani’s head.“Assad is a brutal dictator, but that doesn’t make Jolani more palatable,” Mr. Clarke added. “Neither of these individuals should be running Syria, but U.S. policy needs to deal with realities on the ground and not ideal scenarios.”The U.S. government broke off diplomatic relations with Mr. Assad and his government in 2012, as the uprising that began the previous year spiraled into a devastating civil war.Robert Ford, the U.S. ambassador then, pushed the Obama administration to designate the Al Nusra Front, the precursor to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a terrorist group because its fighters set off two suicide car bombs in Damascus in December 2011. The explosions, outside the offices of a security agency, killed at least 44 people, most of them civilians, according to the Syrian government.Mr. Ford said in an interview on Monday that he would now advise the Biden administration to consider taking Hayat Tahrir al-Sham off the terrorist list because it appears to have adopted more moderate ideas and tactics.Mr. Ford said the group had broken from the Islamic State and Al Qaeda years ago and had fought both organizations. He also said Hayat Tahrir al-Sham tolerated Christian practices and had allowed Christians to rebuild churches in the Idlib region, the part of Syria that the group has controlled and governed in the late stages of the civil war.Mr. Ford added that the Biden administration should ensure it has channels to the main players, and that it should encourage its partners, notably Kurdish militias and political groups in the northeast, to engage in any emerging political process.ImageCelebrating in Umayyad Square in Damascus on Monday.Credit...Daniel Berehulak/The New York TimesThe Pentagon has kept 900 U.S. troops in northeast Syria, where they work with Kurdish fighters in operations against the Islamic State. But the Kurds are trying to fend off attacks by armed groups backed by Turkey.“Instead of trying to manage a political process or support,” Mr. Ford said, “it’s much better to engage at a bit of a distance and be encouraging.”Senior Pentagon officials have said U.S. troops will remain in Syria — at least for now — to continue their efforts to prevent the Islamic State from returning.Daniel Shapiro, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, said at a security conference in Manama, Bahrain, that the Pentagon would push for the Islamic State’s “enduring defeat, to ensure the secure detention of ISIS fighters and the repatriation of displaced persons.”American warplanes carried out airstrikes on Islamic State sites in central Syria on Sunday, hitting more than 75 targets, U.S. officials said.“There should be no doubt — we will not allow ISIS to reconstitute and take advantage of the current situation in Syria,” said Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, the head of U.S. Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East. “All organizations in Syria should know that we will hold them accountable if they partner with or support ISIS in any way.”Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Islamic State militants in Syria have occasionally attacked American troops at a handful of bases in the region.But as the Biden administration focused on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a potential future conflict with China, the counter-ISIS mission in Syria became something of a back-burner issue.During his first administration, President-elect Donald J. Trump sought to withdraw American forces from Syria but was talked out of it by senior Pentagon officials, including Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time.Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.The United Nations said its chief resident coordinator for Syria remained in Damascus to oversee humanitarian operations across the country and that the U.N. had established contact with the rebels who control Syria to discuss logistics, the U.N. spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said. “We want to see the best possible future for the Syrian people, one that they choose themselves, one that is inclusive, one that is fully respective of the rights of minorities,” he said.Syria’s president had stocks of chemical weapons. What happens to them now?ImageA Syrian rebel tries on a gas mask seized from a Syrian army factory in the northwestern province of Idlib in 2013. Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons on rebels and civilians was a defining feature of the early days of Syria’s civil war.Credit...Daniel Leal/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesRebels seized control of Syria’s capital on Sunday, ending the reign of Bashar al-Assad, who infamously used chemical weapons to kill thousands of his own citizens during the country’s 13-year-long civil war.Now, a militia group that once had ties to the Islamic State and al Qaeda, before renouncing them in 2016, is in control of Damascus and, presumably, what is left of Mr. al-Assad’s arsenal, prompting concern in the United States and elsewhere that the chemical weapons could fall into the wrong hands.Here is what you need to know about Syria’s chemical weapons.What is Syria’s history with chemical weapons?Mr. al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons on rebel groups and civilians was a defining feature in the early days of Syria’s civil war, so much so that in 2012, then U.S. President Barack Obama warned that their continued use would cross a “red line” that would justify U.S. military intervention.Mr. al-Assad ignored the warning, and on Aug. 21, 2013, he launched a sarin gas attack on Ghouta, a suburb near Damascus, killing more than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children.Under threat of U.S. retaliation, Mr. al-Assad agreed to a Russian-American deal to eliminate his country’s chemical weapons program — which until that time he had denied having — and to join an international treaty banning chemical weapons.The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, an international monitoring body, was given the task of destroying Syria’s chemical weapon stockpiles in 2013, an undertaking that helped it earn that year’s Nobel Peace Prize. Over the next nine months, the OPCW dismantled and destroyed some 1,100 metric tons of sarin, VX and mustard gas agents and their delivery mechanisms, and certified, in June 2014, that all of Syria’s declared weapons had been removed.Why are people worried?The key word in the OPCW certification of the destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons was that they were the weapons that had originally been “declared” by Syria as part of its arsenal. But Syria’s inventory was not complete.Even at the time, U.S. and OPCW officials suspected that Mr. al-Assad had concealed some of his stockpiles and chemical weapons facilities from the inspectors, a suspicion borne out three years later, when more than 80 civilians were killed in a chemical bombing by Syrian forces in Khan Sheikhoun.“We always knew we had not gotten everything, that the Syrians had not been fully forthcoming in their declaration,” Antony J. Blinken, deputy secretary of state under President Obama, told The New York Times at the time.Almost exactly a year after the Khan Sheikhoun attack, nearly 50 more people were killed on April 7, 2018, in another chemical agent attack near Damascus.The United States, Britain and France responded by bombing three government-run chemical weapons storage and research facilities near Damascus. But U.S. Defense Department officials acknowledged that the Syrian government had most likely retained some of its ability to use chemical weapons.How many chemical weapons are left, and where are they now?As recently as last week, U.S. intelligence agencies were closely monitoring suspected chemical weapons storage sites in Syria, looking for indications that government forces may have been preparing to use remaining stockpiles to prevent rebels from seizing the capital. Now that the Assad government has fallen, there is concern that the weapons could be stolen or used.On Dec. 9, Israel confirmed that it had carried out airstrikes on suspected chemical weapons and missile stockpiles in Syria to stop the weapons from falling “into the hands of extremists,” said Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar.Ralf Trapp, an independent consultant on chemical and bioweapons disarmament who has closely followed the fate of Syria’s chemical weapons program and its dismantlement, said that he suspects what remains of the government’s chemical weapons arsenal is small, given Mr. al-Assad’s limited deployment of chemical weapons and the few times he has used them after 2014.“You did not see massive rocket attacks with sarin gas” he said of the 2017 and 2018 incidents. “We are talking about a small number of grenades. So I would not be surprised if it’s a fairly limited amount that we are talking about.”How easily could chemical weapons be used?Not easily. Chemical weapons are not stored in a ready-to-use format. The precursor chemicals for sarin gas are volatile and can only be combined in the warhead just before deployment — hours, or at a maximum, days, Mr. Trapp said.“Unless they know what the recipe is, how to mix them together and how to do that safely without killing themselves, I would be skeptical about an armed group running into that kind of a stockpile and then actually being able to convert it into an effective weapon,” he added.What can be done to keep the arsenal safe?The OPCW announced on Monday that it has been closely monitoring recent developments in Syria as well as the security and integrity of all the country’s declared chemical weapons research, development, production, storage and testing sites. Once a new government is in place, Mr. Trapp said the OPCW will try to work with the new leadership to destroy what remains.Adam Entous contributed reporting.Israel continued to strike targets in Syria on Monday, including air defense systems in the port city of Latakia and strategic sites that belonged to Assad regime forces in the Hama and Damascus regions, according to The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based war monitoring group. In a letter to the United Nations Security Council, Israel’s ambassador to the U.N., Danny Danon, called the developments in Syria a security threat and said “Israel has taken limited and temporary measures to counter any further threat to its citizens.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said “Israel would like to see a different Syria” as a neighbor but pledged to work with the country’s new leadership — as long as it was in Israel’s interests. “We extend our hand to those who want to live with us in peace; we will cut off the hand of anyone who tries to harm us,” Netanyahu said in a televised briefing Monday evening. Foreign governments weigh recognizing rebels they once shunned as extremist.ImageThe leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham speaking to supporters in the Umayyad Mosque on Sunday.Credit...Aref Tammawi/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesA day after rebels in Syria toppled the president and assumed power, it was unclear on Monday whether many foreign governments would grant recognition to the transitional authorities.Recognition would lend legitimacy to the main rebel group behind the uprising and help unlock more international humanitarian aid for Syria. But many countries, including the United States, designate the group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which is Islamist, as a terrorist organization and have not had formal contact with it.The group has in the past had ties to both Al Qaeda and the Islamic state, but it recent years, seeking to establish legitimacy, it has renounced jihadism.A British minister told the BBC that Britain was considering striking the group from its list of banned terrorist groups, the first step toward a direct relationship. France had also made overtures toward the rebels, and on Sunday, The New York Times reported that the Biden administration was also weighing how much to engage with the new leaders in Damascus.The diplomatic repositioning appeared likely to expand the influence of Turkey, which has long maintained ties with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and openly backs other Syrian rebel factions. It is now emerging as a go-between for the rebels and outside powers.Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, said in a televised address to diplomats in Ankara on Monday that Turkey was in touch with all parties.A day earlier, Mr. Fidan called on Syria’s new leaders to preserve state institutions and ensure equal treatment for minorities, including Christians, non-Arabs and Kurds.“The new administration must be established in an orderly manner,” he said. “The principle of inclusiveness must never be compromised. There must never be a desire for revenge. It is time to unite and reconstruct the country.”Mr. Fidan also called on the new Syrian government to secure any chemical weapons stores left over from the Assad regime.Western countries are likely to demand similar conditions in exchange for dropping Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s terrorist designation and granting the group the international legitimacy it has long craved, said Jerome Drevon, an expert at the International Crisis Group who has studied and spoken extensively with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.Among Arab governments, most of whom regard Islamist groups with extreme wariness and had long ago resigned themselves to working with Mr. al-Assad, the mood appeared even more cautious.“We’ve seen countries in the region fall in a deep abyss after temporary moments of jubilation,” Tamim Khallaf, a spokesman for Egypt’s foreign ministry, said on Monday. “Egypt will continue to work with regional and international partners to assist Syria during this delicate stage in its history.”Christiaan Triebert and Riley MellenA satellite image taken on Monday shows no large Russian Navy vessels at the Syrian port of Tartus, a key Russian naval base. Over the past three weeks, satellite imagery had shown a submarine, three frigates and two support ships docked there, but these vessels appear to have departed within the past few days as rebels rapidly advanced on Damascus. The Soviet Union and later Russia have maintained a near-continuous presence at Tartus since the facility’s establishment in 1971. As Russia’s only deep-water port in the Mediterranean, Tartus plays a critical role for Moscow to project military power in the region.Syrian opposition activists who had been in exile for years are beginning to flock back to the country, hoping to shape the unfolding transition. Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director of the United States-based Syrian Emergency Task Force, said on Monday that he was on his way to Damascus, where he said he planned to meet with the new leadership and other returning members of the opposition to chart a course forward.“Everyone’s welcome in the conversation of the future Syria,” Moustafa said, adding of the rebels: “They’re very open-minded. Everyone’s been willing to listen, and it’s been really refreshing to see that.” Full of optimism, he added: “Syria is closer to being a democracy than any other Arab nation.” Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security adviser, is expected to travel to Israel later this week, and may make other stops in the Middle East, according to administration officials. The trip appears to be part of the engagement with allies that President Biden referred to in his brief remarks on Sunday welcoming the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, but warning of the risks ahead, especially involving the reactions of Iran and Russia.The rebels’ leader, Ahmed al-Shara (formerly known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani), made a conciliatory gesture toward preserving Syria’s government institutions and their staff on Monday. Though the rebels have some experience governing the smaller patch of territory they formerly held, “regardless, we can’t dispense with the previous state,” he told al-Assad’s prime minister in a meeting on Monday, according to a clip of the meeting posted in the rebel leadership’s Telegram channel. The rebels are forming a new transitional government, they said in a statement earlier, but have called on a public sector employees to return to work.A rebel leader sheds his nom de guerre and speaks of the work ahead for Syria.ImageThe rebel leader known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani revealed his real name, Ahmed al-Shara, as he addressed a crowd on Monday at a mosque in Damascus.Credit...Aref Tammawi/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe leader of the rebels who seized Syria’s capital has shed the nom de guerre he used throughout his country’s civil war. In a video shared on the official Telegram account of the Syrian offensive, he was identified not as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani but by his real name, Ahmed al-Shara.Speaking at the ancient Umayyad mosque in Damascus, Mr. al-Shara can be seen in the video lauding the rebels’ surprisingly rapid victory. “By God’s grace, this land of Syria was liberated within 11 days from its north to its south, from its east to its west,” he said.Mr. al-Shara, whose Hayat Tahrir al-Sham rebels led the offensive that ousted President Bashar al-Assad, was born in Saudi Arabia in 1982, the child of Syrian exiles. His parents left the Golan Heights after Israel captured them in the 1967 war.His chosen nom de guerre — sometimes rendered as al-Golani — is believed to have been inspired by the place his family is from in Syria.Mr. al-Shara pointed to the exodus of Syrians set off by the 13-year conflict. The United Nations has called it one of the largest refugee crises in the world.“How many were displaced all over this world?” he said. “How many lived in tents? How many drowned in the seas?”Now, he said, “People have returned to their homes.”Mr. al-Shara made the video while standing near the front of the mosque, the geometric tiles on the walls set aglow by a large chandelier above him. He was surrounded by bodyguards and a crowd of men, many holding up their phones to record the moment.“We have to build Syria,” he said in a nod to the uncertain future ahead for the country. “We have to build it in a right and effective way, so that Syria can return to its pioneering place in the world.”Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, praised the Syrian rebels as “heroes” and congratulated them for their victory against the regime of Bashar al-Assad in a televised address after discussing developments in Syria with his cabinet on Monday. “Syria belongs to Syrians with all of their ethnic, religious and sectarian identities,” Erdogan said, speaking at his presidential palace in the capital, Ankara. “It is the Syrians who would decide about today and tomorrow of Syria,” he added. Turkey would only support the efforts to rebuild its neighbor, he added.Erdogan said Turkey would open the border gate in the southern border town of Yayladagi, to ease traffic and prevent accumulation of Syrians who want to go back to the country.SANA, Syria’s state-run news agency, has rebranded its logo with the three red stars of the Syrian opposition flag, and is now posting again on Telegram. It is carrying statements from various government ministries, calling on public sector and health workers to return to their places of work. For more than five decades, the news agency had been a mouthpiece of the Assad family dynasty.Critic’s NotebookIn Syria, an image of rebellion is embodied by the hoodie.ImageIn this still image taken from a Syria TV broadcast, men claiming to be rebel forces proclaim the liberation of Damascus.Credit...Syria TV, via ReutersThe rebels appeared on Syrian state television over the weekend in puffer jackets and sweatshirts. One wore what appeared to be a trucker hat. A man in the center — the group’s appointed spokesman — wore a black hoodie as he addressed the Syrian people.The forces had achieved “the liberation of the city of Damascus, the toppling of the dictator Bashar al-Assad, and the liberation of all oppressed prisoners from the regime’s jails,” the hoodied man declared, his beard protruding forward.With that, President Bashar al-Assad’s reign ended. The dictator resigned, fleeing the Syrian capital as rebels seized control of the city in a head-spinning weekend-long blitz.If the rebels’ words proclaimed a new dawn for Syria, their divergent attire amplified that message. Mr. al-Assad was many things and, among them, was a steady and formal dresser. Throughout his 24-year authoritarian rule, the erstwhile ophthalmologist clung to sober dark suits, starched white shirts and ties.Mr. al-Assad’s austere attire embodied his assertion that all was under control — even as it most certainly was not. After the Syrian civil war began in 2011, Mr. al-Assad imprisoned dissenters and engaged in a protracted battle leaving more than 500,000 Syrians dead. Under his leadership, the Syrian economy shriveled and droughts led to a nationwide hunger crisis.As his country plummeted into disarray, Mr. al-Assad’s appearance only became more decorous. In the latter half of his presidency, the ties became clones of themselves: grayish blue and tied with an assertive knot the size of a toddler’s fist. He wore his hair close-cropped, as if trimmed daily. After sampling a mustache in his younger years, his face is now clean-shaven at all times. Mr. al-Assad was a dictator who styled himself in the international image of an exacting hedge fund manager.That polished persona did not help endear Mr. al-Assad to his public in the end. Photos and videos from the streets of Damascus over the weekend showed posters of the dapper, freshly deposed dictator riddled with bullet holes and being lit on fire.ImageBashar al-Assad styled himself in the international image of an exacting hedge fund manager.Credit...Louai Beshara/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesImageA man treads on a picture of Syria’s ousted president as people enter his residence.Credit...Omar Haj Kadour/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAs for the rebels who appeared on television, not one of them wore a tie, let alone a collared shirt. Still, there was also nothing overtly militaristic about their divergent attire. Their clothes were free of insignia and they dressed nearly all in black. Only one man wore olive green, recalling an army surplus store.There was a pronounced inconsistency to their clothes. Puffers on some, sweatshirts on others, moto-looking jackets on another. If there was any mandate to appear united in their clothes, it wasn’t adhered to.Beyond the frame of the video, footage from Damascus over the weekend showed rebel fighters, occasionally clutching guns, in catch-as-catch-can clothes — white hoodies, jeans, cargo pants and track jackets.Reflecting the lightning speed with which these rebel groups took Damascus, it wasn’t clear on Sunday who these men were, specifically whether Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the Islamist leader who led the charge into Damascus was in the video. Past photos show Mr. al-Jolani dressed more like a stereotypical revolutionary leader in a drab green jacket and matching olive green flat cap, that echoed the hat that Fidel Castro wore in his latter life.Though the weekend’s victorious broadcast wasn’t of the highest quality, the men didn’t appear to be soiled or even sweaty. There were no weapons visible in the frame. On mute, they looked as if they could’ve been attending an early winter soccer match, or commuting to jobs anywhere in this world.If Mr. al-Assad’s suits conveyed cold untouchability, the hoodie worn by the spokesman cried out with its modesty. It is a near certainty that many of those seeing the broadcast in Syria and elsewhere were dressed similarly to this man in the dark hoodie at the center.The black hoodie is thus its own version of modern camouflage, one suited for the urban environments in which much contemporary warfare occurs. To wear mottled green camo in a city like Damascus would have made the rebels stick out. In their dark, nondescript clothes they could slip right in with the citizens of the capital. (This is true not just in Damascus, but all modern cities. See: how the cloaking hood worn by the man who shot the UnitedHealthcare chief executive, Brian Thompson, in New York has aided him in avoiding capture thus far.)ImageSyrian rebel fighters walk across a street in Damascus on Sunday.Credit...Sam Hariri/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIn recent history, the hoodie’s every-man essence has made it both a revolutionary placard and a fraught cultural signifier — often at the same time.In the aughts, tech-overlords like Mark Zuckerberg employed the sweatshirt as a middle-finger to formality when they crashed into the business world. When his country was wrestled into war with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine swapped his suits for man-of-the-people sweatshirts, including an “I’m Ukrainian” hoodie. More gravely, the killing of the hoodie-clad teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 brought new scrutiny to how people of color are profiled for wearing the garment in America.With much still unsettled in Syria over the weekend, and a populace fighting in whatever garb it has, the choice of the sweatshirt from the rebel group’s speaker made for a kangaroo-pocketed beacon that signaled the new regime will not be like the last.European countries are pausing asylum decisions for Syrians.ImageMembers of the Syrian community in Berlin celebrating the end of Bashar al-Assad’s rule.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesGermany has suspended all asylum decisions for people coming from Syria, its office of migration and refugees announced on Monday, as Western nations grapple with how to respond to the rebellion that toppled the Assad dynasty.Nancy Faeser, Germany’s interior minister, said that while she was hopeful about recent events in Syria, where rebels ousted the longtime president, Bashar al-Assad, over the weekend, the situation on the ground was complex.“The further assessment of the protection status of recognized Syrian refugees living in Germany depends on further developments in Syria,” she said in a statement on Monday. Deportations for Syrians who have been convicted of crimes will also be suspended until the situation becomes clearer, her office said.At least two other countries in Europe — Austria and Sweden — announced similar decisions on Monday.Asylum decisions in Germany are based in part on whether people would be endangered if they were returned to their home country. It was not immediately clear how many Syrian applications would be affected.The rebels that toppled the repressive Assad government are led by an Islamist group called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which was once linked to Al Qaeda but has since tried to gain international legitimacy by rejecting global jihadist ambitions. More recently, the group’s leader has tried to reassure minority communities from other sects and religions that they would not be treated harshly, but it remains to be seen if that will be the case. Nearly a million Syrians currently live in Germany, the vast majority having left during the civil war and Mr. al-Assad’s brutal crackdown on dissent.During a major exodus of Syrians in 2015, Chancellor Angela Merkel refused to close Germany’s borders.A majority of those who arrived then have learned German and have been integrated. Last year alone, 75,000 of them became German citizens. But the issue of migration has become increasingly divisive in Germany, as in other Western countries, with some local leaders saying the large influx of migrants has strained their resources.As Germany readies itself for the likelihood of a snap parliamentary election campaign this winter, the question of what to do about Syrian refugees has become a topic of discussion, especially as mainstream parties try to pre-empt the far right.Far-right politicians, who have long tried to paint refugees as the source of Germany’s problems, wasted little time in suggesting that the threats in Syria had been removed by Mr. al-Assad’s ouster.“Syria is liberated, the new rulers are calling on Syrians to return. I am curious to see how many will really go back, especially since the reason for seeking asylum no longer applies,” Frank Grobe, a politician with the Alternative for Germany party, wrote on X.Jürgen Hardt, a foreign affairs specialist with the conservative Christian Democratic Union, which is ahead in the polls, said he believed the end of the Assad government would change things for Syrians living in Germany. “I think that at the end of the day, a great many Syrians who are here will go back to Syria,” he said.Jens Spahn, a fellow conservative member of the Christian Democrats who has taken a hard line in the past on migration, suggested providing free flights and 1,000 euros for all Syrians who want to return.Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s foreign minister and a member of the center-left Green party, warned against trying use the fall of Mr. al-Assad for domestic politics. “Anyone who is now trying to turn this situation in Syria, where the future is completely unclear, into a political issue has completely lost touch with reality in the Middle East,” she said.Many Syrians already have asylum protection in Germany, so the decision on Monday would apply to relative newcomers..Rebels rush to establish order as they form a transitional government.ImageArmed rebel fighters walking through the Old City of Damascus on Monday.Credit...Bilal Alhammoud/EPA, via ShutterstockA day after sweeping into Damascus, the rebel coalition that found itself suddenly in charge of the Syrian capital and its government institutions hurried on Monday to establish order, trying to fill the vacuum left by the crumbling of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.The rebels’ military leadership announced in a statement on Telegram that its forces were “about to finish controlling the capital and preserving public property,” and that it was forming a transitional government. The statement did not name the leader of the transitional government, but local news reports said it would be Mohammed al-Bashir, who previously served as the head of a rebel-run administration in northwestern Syria.The new, de facto leaders of Syria appeared to be striving for security, stability and continuity. Though there were reports over the weekend of looting at government institutions, offices and private homes, both before and after the rebels entered Damascus, rebel fighters on Monday stood guard outside government institutions and directed traffic throughout the capital. The new authorities also circulated images on social media of security personnel patrolling the city’s streets.At the same time, the Syrian state news agency — which formerly served as an al-Assad mouthpiece — had rebranded with the rebels’ green, white and black flag. On Monday, it carried a series of decrees apparently aimed at establishing order: State oil, health care and transportation employees were being called back to work, and there would be a general amnesty for the thousands of personnel in Mr. al-Assad’s military who had been forced into service.The rebels’ leader, Ahmed al-Shara (formerly known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani), said in a Monday meeting with Mr. al-Assad’s prime minister and Mr. al-Bashir that the rebels had some experience governing in northwestern Syria.“Regardless, we can’t dispense with the previous state,” he said, according to a clip of the meeting posted in the rebel leadership’s Telegram channel.The new authorities’ goal appeared to be to avoid the kind of chaos that has gripped other Arab nations when rebellions overthrew longtime dictators. In Libya during the 2011 Arab Spring revolt and Iraq during the 2003 American invasion, for example, looting was widespread and order broke down, prompting armed groups to jockey for power and leading to years of dysfunction and bloodshed.Jerome Drevon, an expert at the International Crisis Group who has studied and spoken extensively with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamist group that spearheaded the rebel offensive, said the fighters had told him since taking Damascus that they would focus first on establishing security and providing basic services.That will be easier said than done, especially because the rebels across Syria do not all belong to the same group. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham leads the group in Damascus, which now controls most of the country. Another group dominates in the south. Kurdish-led, U.S.-backed forces hold sway in the northeast.So far, however, other rebels appear to be heeding the main coalition’s directives to preserve state institutions and avoid looting and acts of revenge.“You need to present as much continuity as possible to avoid what happened elsewhere,” Mr. Drevon said. “Security is a major, major issue, because as people start fighting, weapons start spreading, everything goes down from there.”There were signs that Mr. al-Assad’s bureaucrats were accepting their new leaders. A day after Syria’s foreign ministry said in a statement that embassies overseas would continue providing services to Syrian citizens, the Syrian Embassy in Russia raised the rebels’ green flag over its mansion in central Moscow on Monday morning, according to news footage.ImageRaising the Syrian opposition flag at the Syrian embassy in Moscow on Monday.Credit...Alexander Zemlianichenko/Associated PressBut beyond restoring order, the new leadership must confront daunting questions about Syria’s future political system. On Monday, Syrian opposition activists who had been in exile for years were also beginning to flock back to the country, hoping to shape the unfolding transition.Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director of the United States-based Syrian Emergency Task Force, said he had been in regular contact with senior rebel officials since before the offensive began. He said he had urged them to continue protecting Syrian minorities and to quickly restore public services that had been scarce under the previous government, such as electricity and water.On Monday, he was on his way to Damascus, where he said he planned to meet with the new leadership and other returning members of the opposition to chart a course forward.“Everyone’s welcome in the conversation of the future Syria,” he said, adding of the rebels, “They’re very open-minded. Everyone’s been willing to listen, and it’s been really refreshing to see that.”Full of optimism, he added: “Syria is closer to being a democracy than any other Arab nation.”Safak Timur contributed reporting from Istanbul, Jacob Roubai from Beirut, Lebanon, and Rania Khaled from Cairo.Fighting still rages in northern Syria as rebel groups vie for territory.ImageSoldiers with the Manbij Military Council, part of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Manbij, Syria, in 2019.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York TimesFighting raged in parts of Syria on Monday, a day after rebels overthrew the Assad regime, as armed groups with competing interests continued to vie for territory and power.Many of the clashes were centered around Kurdish-controlled areas in northern Syria, where Turkish-backed rebel groups have intensified a military offensive against forces backed by the United States.As the rebel alliance that toppled President Bashar al-Assad held meetings in the Syrian capital, Damascus, and announced on Monday that it intended to form a transition government, the violence elsewhere highlighted Syria’s complex web of opposition groups, many of them holding different objectives and visions for a post-Assad future.There were fierce battles in the northern city of Manbij, near Syria’s border with Turkey, which has for years been under the control of the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led coalition of rebel groups supported by the United States. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group based in Britain, the city was captured on Monday by the Syrian National Army, a ragtag coalition of armed opposition groups backed by Turkey. A spokesperson for the Syrian Democratic Forces said fighters with the Syrian National Army had taken only 60 percent of the city. The claims could not be independently verified.The offensive has been supported by Turkish airstrikes, leaving dozens of combatants dead and forcing many of the city’s hundreds of thousands of residents to flee, according to Kurdish-led forces and the Observatory.Since the separate rebel assault against the Assad regime gathered pace last month, the Turkish military appears to have ramped up its attacks on areas controlled by the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces. Among them, a Turkish drone strike on a house killed 11 civilians, six of them children, the Observatory said on Monday.Turkey and the United States are allies, sworn to protect each other as members of the NATO alliance. Though both countries celebrated the ouster on Sunday of Mr. al-Assad, their interests diverge over support for the Kurds in northern Syria, and the conflict in Syria has long strained the alliance between Ankara and Washington.Turkey views the presence of armed Kurds so close to its border as a threat. For years, the Kurdish-led forces in Syria have been important partners for the U.S. in fighting the Islamic State, the Islamist terrorist group that swept through the country and neighboring Iraq more than a decade ago amid the chaos of Syria’s civil war.Although the Islamic State’s so-called caliphate has since been destroyed, the group has reconstituted in recent years in the Syrian desert and has launched sporadic attacks against Syrian regime troops.The head of the Syrian Democratic Forces, Mazloum Abdi, warned last week of the Islamic State’s resurgence, stating at a news conference that there had been “increased movement” by the group in the desert region.The warning added to growing fears that the Islamic State could exploit the power vacuum left by the Assad regime’s downfall — a key concern for U.S. leaders.“We’re cleareyed about the fact that ISIS will try to take advantage of any vacuum to reestablish its capability, to create a safe haven,” President Biden said on Sunday, using an acronym for the terror group.“We will not let that happen,” he added.Hours later, Mr. Biden authorized U.S. airstrikes against Islamic State camps and operatives inside Syria. A swarm of B-52, F-15 and A-10 warplanes hit more than 75 targets in central Syria with about 140 munitions, according to U.S. officials.Eve Sampson contributed reporting.Crowds throng to a prison outside Damascus, desperate for news of detainees.ImageSurveying cells in the Sednaya Prison on Monday in Damascus, Syria.Credit...Daniel Berehulak/The New York TimesCrowds descended on a prison on the outskirts of Damascus, the Syrian capital, on Monday, desperate to learn the fate of friends and relatives detained at a place that symbolized terror and death under the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.Some hailed taxis or waited for buses from the city to the prison, Sednaya, which opened over the weekend as Mr. al-Assad fell. Others packed into cars, inching through traffic. Many appeared conflicted by hope and dread amid the euphoria that has gripped Damascus since Mr. al-Assad fled to Russia.“Seizing the city is a joy — we are joyous,” said one rebel fighter, Mohammad Bakir, who sat in the back of a mud-caked car en route to the prison, his rifle tucked between his knees. He said he had not heard from his mother, brother and cousin since they disappeared in 2012 after they protested against the government and were presumably detained.“But the real victory will be when I find my family,” Mr. Bakir, 42, said above the din of car horns.Prisons were central to Mr. al-Assad’s ability to crush the civilian uprising that began in 2011 and the rebellion that followed. He set up an industrial-scale system of arbitrary arrests and torture prisons, according to reports by human rights groups.More than 130,000 people were subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention by the government, according to a report in August by the Syrian Network for Human Rights, a nonprofit, which began its count when the conflict started in 2011. The network said that more than 15,000 people had died “due to torture” by government forces from 2011 to July this year.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a separate organization that is based in Britain and that documents abuses in Syria, has estimated that more than 30,000 detainees were killed in Sednaya alone.ImageSyrians climbed up the hill leading to the Sednaya Prison on Monday.Credit...Daniel Berehulak/The New York TimesA crucial element of the pall that the prisons cast over the country was secrecy. People were swallowed up by the system, and families often struggled to discover whether their relatives had even been detained, much less to determine their fate. As a result, the opening of the prisons became an imperative for the rebels.Videos sent to The New York Times by a group of doctors visiting Sednaya appeared to show the dire conditions inside. The footage was shared by the Independent Doctors Association, a group providing humanitarian and medical assistance in Syria.Numbered cells, each of which appear to have held a dozen or more people, are seen littered with debris, clothing and personal belongings. Journalists, armed fighters and civilians, including children, roam the prison. Several men scrape at the concrete and grates along a wall in an apparent attempt to reach hidden cells.In the northwestern city of Aleppo, dozens of families gathered at a traffic circle, hoping for the arrival of loved ones who had been detained. The spot was known during the war as the Death Roundabout because it was a regular target of government airstrikes.Some were certain that their family members were alive and would arrive soon. Others had no information, only hope.A vehicle dropped off one former prisoner from Sednaya, his face gaunt and his legs and body weakened by years of detention. Two relatives helped him stand. A small band of musicians beat drums to celebrate his survival.The man was soon thronged by people holding their cellphones up to his face. They were showing him photographs of detainees, hoping he might have news.",
