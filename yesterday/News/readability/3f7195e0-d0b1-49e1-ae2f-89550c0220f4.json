Getty ImagesA maintenance worker found the couple deceased in their home on Wednesday. / SplashNews.comAs the dispatcher paused to call for the paramedics, the caller began crying while repeatedly saying, “Damn.”However, the man didn’t seem to have a personal connection to Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 64, as he could not tell the dispatcher any personal details about them.“[It’s] a female and a male probably. I don’t know, sir. Just send somebody up here really quick,” he said.The caller said he had “no idea” if the two were “awake” or “breathing” because he “was not inside the house” with them.The unidentified caller pleaded for police assistance. Ron Galella Collection via Getty ImagesThe workers later told police they hadn’t seen the couple in two weeks. Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images“[The house] is closed. It’s locked. I can’t go in,” he said. “But I see that she is lying down on the floor from the window.”He insisted they were not “awake” or “alert” and saw no signs of movement.“No, dude, they’re not moving!” he said while growing increasingly concerned. “Just send somebody out here really quick!”The man suggested he worked for the gated community where the couple lived and instructed the officers to meet him at the front entrance.The caller could see Arakawa lying down inside the house. WireImageThe two were pronounced dead on the scene. Ron Galella Collection via Getty ImagesOnce police entered the home, they found Arakawa lying on her right side in the bathroom. The Santa Fe detective who examined the scene said there was “bloating in her face and mummification in her hands and feet.”There were pills strewn atop the bathroom countertop and evidence that she may have fallen suddenly.Given the state of her body, authorities believe she was dead for some time. Meanwhile, her husband was found in a separate room off the kitchen. Police believe he, too, may have fallen as his glasses were located next to his body.Authorities believe the two died a while before they were discovered. ullstein bild via Getty ImagesTheir deaths have been labeled “suspicious.” AFP via Getty ImagesWhile two of the couple’s dogs were found alive and healthy, the third was discovered dead “10-15 feet” away from Arakawa.The workers who found Hackman and the classical pianist told police they hadn’t seen them in about two weeks.A search warrant was issued for the home as authorities believe their deaths are “suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation.”Although it was originally assumed the two died from carbon monoxide poisoning, there were “no obvious signs of a gas leak” following an inspection by the fire department and the New Mexico gas company.",
