  "text": "Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas named close confidant Hussein al-Sheikh as his deputy and likely successor on Saturday, the Palestine Liberation Organisation said, a step widely seen as needed to assuage international doubts over Palestinian leadership.Abbas, 89, has headed the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority (PA) since the death of veteran leader Yasser Arafat in 2004 but he had for years resisted internal reforms including the naming of a successor.Sheikh, born in 1960, is a veteran of Fatah, the main PLO faction which was founded by Arafat and is now headed by Abbas. He is widely viewed as a pragmatist with very close ties to Israel.He was named PLO vice president after the organisation's executive committee approved his nomination by Abbas, the PLO said in a statement.Reform of the PA, which exercises limited autonomy in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has been a priority for the United States and Gulf monarchies hoping the body can play a central role in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Pressure to reform has intensified since the start of the war in Gaza, where the PLO's main Palestinian rival Hamas has battled Israel for more than 18 months, leaving the tiny, crowded territory in ruins.The United States has promoted the idea of a reformed PA governing in Gaza after the war. Gulf monarchies, which are seen as the most likely source of funding for reconstruction in Gaza after the war, also want major reforms of the body.CALL FOR HAMAS TO DISARMIsrael's declared goal in Gaza is the destruction of Hamas but it has also ruled out giving the PA any role in government there. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he opposes the creation of a Palestinian state.Hamas, which follows a militant Islamist ideology, has controlled Gaza since 2007 when it defeated the PA in a brief civil war after winning an election the previous year. It also has a large presence in the West Bank.At a meeting of the PLO's Central Council on Wednesday and Thursday that approved the position of vice president without naming an appointee, Abbas made his clearest ever call for Hamas to completely disarm and hand its weapons - and responsibility for governing in Gaza - to the PA.Widespread corruption, lack of progress towards an independent state and increasing Israeli military incursions in the West Bank have undermined the PA's popularity among many Palestinians.The body has been controlled by Fatah since it was formed in the Oslo Accords with Israel in 1993 and it last held parliamentary elections in 2005.Sheikh, who was imprisoned by Israel for his activities opposing the occupation during the period 1978-89, has worked as the PA's main contact liaising with the Israeli government under Abbas and been his envoy on visits to world powers.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",
