  "text": "Two faculty organisations at Harvard University filed a lawsuit on Friday against the Trump administration, claiming it is violating constitutional rights by threatening to cut billions in federal funding. The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and its Harvard chapter are challenging the administration’s decision to review nearly $9 billion in federal funds given to the university over alleged antisemitism on its campus, reported New York Times. The lawsuit, filed in the US district court in Massachusetts, argues that the move undermines free speech and academic freedom protected under the first amendment. The groups have also requested a temporary restraining order to prevent any immediate withdrawal of funds. “This is an unlawful misuse of federal authority,” the lawsuit says. The professors argue that the government is using funding as a tool to punish institutions that do not align with president Trump’s views. The White House has not responded to the lawsuit or given further comments. Earlier, the administration accused Harvard of not doing enough to stop antisemitic incidents on campus. It claimed that the university had failed to protect its students and faculty. Alan Garber, Harvard’s current president, has acknowledged the concern around antisemitism and said the university has worked hard to address it over the past 15 months. However, no official comment has been made by Harvard regarding the lawsuit. Andrew Manuel Crespo, a Harvard law professor and counsel for the faculty group, said that the government’s actions are an attempt to limit academic speech. \"Harvard faculty have the constitutional right to speak, teach and conduct research without fearing that the government will retaliate against their viewpoints by canceling grants,\" Crespo said.",
