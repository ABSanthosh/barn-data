Only difference is this time, Kamala Harris had her husband Doug Emhoff by her side and it was Doug who did more talking in the 28-second message and Harris looked at him, nodded and spoke little. The conspiracy theories were rife that both the videos were taped together when Kamala Harris was 'drunk'.\"Greetings everyone, and Happy Thanksgiving!\" Kamala Harris said beginning the message. \"Today we come together to reflect on what we are thankful for and to share our appreciation for one another, surrounded by family, friends, and those we cherish, we cook our favorite recipes, share family stories, serve those in need and give thanks for our blessings,\" Doug said. \"On Thanksgiving, we also expressed our gratitude as a nation for our service members and their families who sacrifice so much to protect our nation and our most sacred values,\" Harris said. 'So again, from our family to yours,' she said. 'Happy Thanksgiving everyone!' Harris and Emhoff said in unison. \"She appeared to film the video in the same location as her viral video where internet users accused her of being drunk,\" one user saidAfter the election defeat, Harris went low key and recently Harris and Doug spent six days vacationing on Hawaii's big island before traveling to the Bay Area ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. They were back in DC, however, for Turkey Day. On Wednesday, the entire Harris-Emhoff family visited DC Central Kitchen, a non-profit that receives donations from local restaurants to feed the underserved. Both of Emhoff's children, Ella and Cole, were on hand, along with Cole's wife Greenley Littlejohn, as well as Harris' sister Maya, her husband Tony West and their daughter Meena, who brought along her children Amara and Leela. Harris told the reporters on the scene that her Thanksgiving menu consisted of turkey and ham, her famous cornmeal stuffing, sweet potatoes, string beans, Brussels sprouts, a salad and dinner rolls.",
