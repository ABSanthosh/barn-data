  "text": "KYIV — A confrontational White House meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and President Donald Trump drew exasperated and fearful reactions from European and Ukrainian observers, as Kyiv’s hopes of aligning Trump’s view of the war with its own dwindled with each heated exchange.“I’m just crying because of what I hear,” a Ukrainian lawmaker said of the meeting, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.Just the word “wow” is how Oleksandr, 40, a Ukrainian military officer fighting in Russia’s Kursk region, responded to the video of the argument.“We still have a lot of work to be done,” he wrote. “Better war, than shameful peace.”Zelensky left the White House early Friday, forgoing a planned news conference. And Trump made his position clear after the meeting in a post on Truth Social, saying the Ukrainian leader is “not ready for Peace,” and accusing him of disrespecting the United States. “He can come back when he is ready for Peace,” Trump added.An anticipated minerals deal between the United States and Ukraine was also not signed, a White House official confirmed. The deal would grant Washington partial access to Ukraine’s minerals as part of an effort by the Trump administration to recoup the cost of U.S. war aid.In a brief statement after the meeting, Zelensky thanked Trump, “Congress, and the American people,” adding that “Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.”President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky engaged in an argument about the Russia- Ukraine war on Feb. 28. (Video: The Washington Post, Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)European officials, meanwhile, rallied around Zelensky on Friday night, with several lawmakers and diplomats expressing shock and dismay. European leaders, including in Spain, Lithuania, Moldova, Sweden, Latvia and Norway, among others, all posted messages in solidarity with Zelensky.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X: “Dear Zelensky, dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone.”French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated his support for Ukraine in remarks to reporters Friday evening: “I think we were all right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago and to continue to do so. And when I say we, it’s the United States of America, the Europeans, the Canadians, the Japanese and many others.”“We must thank all those who helped and respect those who have been fighting from the start because they are fighting for their dignity, their independence, for their children and for the security of Europe,” he added. “These are simple things, but they are good to recall at this moment.”German election winner Friedrich Merz, probably the country’s new chancellor, wrote to Zelensky: “We stand with Ukraine in good and in testing times.” Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said his country continues to support Ukraine, “especially now.”Even Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, a Trump ally, said that “division would not suit anyone” in a statement calling for leaders in Ukraine, Europe and the United States to meet to discuss “today’s great challenges, starting with Ukraine.” Meloni’s statement did not directly reference Trump, Zelensky, or Friday’s Oval Office meeting, only obliquely referring to those outside of the West “who would like to see the decline of our civilization.”There was one prominent exception to the chorus of supporting voices among European leaders: Moscow-friendly Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who commended Trump on Friday, saying he “stood bravely for peace.”“Strong men make peace, weak men make war,” he said.The combative exchange was also met with shock, and in many cases fury, across the political spectrum in the United Kingdom. The White House fireworks came one day after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s own meeting with Trump. The meeting highlighted mutual good feelings with the mercurial president that were greeted as at least tentatively hopeful signs that Washington could be brought along in support not just for U.S.-U.K. relations but for Ukraine, as well.That optimism was quickly swept away as news of the Oval Office shouting match spread. A Conservative Party member described Trump’s and Vice President JD Vance’s treatment of Zelensky “stomach churning.” Several members of parliament called on Starmer to revoke the invitation for a visit with King Charles that he had extended to Trump a day earlier.Senior Conservative Party leader Robert Jenrick said in a post on X that he was “sickened by that degrading spectacle.”“And to think the bust of Winston Churchill was in the same room as it unfolded,” Jenrick posted. “He would be turning in his grave if he saw that happen. Ukraine’s people, led by President Zelensky, have fought bravely to hold off Putin.”Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats Party, posted on X: “This is thuggery from Trump and Vance, plain and simple. They are bullying the brave true patriot Zelensky into accepting a deal which effectively hands victory to Russia. Unless the UK and Europe step up, we are facing a betrayal of Ukraine.”Ukrainian political analyst Maria Zolkina commended Zelensky for his approach to the meeting despite previous criticisms of his emotional style of communication.“I fully and completely support and commend how he held himself,” Zolkina said. “In today’s show … Zelensky was not only himself but also embodied each of us: When your main ‘card’ is your right to have your own country, your dignity, and the courage to defend it.”Zelensky’s top adviser, Andriy Yermak, appeared to defend that approach in a statement on X.“I support the President as he defends the interests of our heroic nation. In every situation,” Yermak wrote. “We are grateful to those who stand with us.”Still, the reaction in Ukraine was not all unreserved praise.“Only the Kremlin is happy about the current situation,” said Ukrainian opposition lawmaker Mykola Kniazhytskyi, who called the emotional tenor of the meeting unfortunate. “The American people should be sure: Ukrainians want peace most of all.”Zelensky’s performance also received negative reviews in Russia.Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Zelensky of lying at the meeting, adding that it was “a miracle of restraint how Trump and Vance restrained themselves and didn’t punch this scumbag.”Francis reported from Brussels and Hendrix from London.
