The demonstrations focused on issues such as immigration policies, changes to transgender rights, and a proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza.Protesters in cities including Philadelphia and state capitols in California, Minnesota, Michigan, Texas, Wisconsin, Indiana, and others held signs criticizing Trump, Elon Musk—who leads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—and Project 2025, a set of conservative policy proposals.Hundreds of people also gathered in Washington, DC, to support USAID as the Trump administration moves to shut down the agency. The decision has led US workers worldwide to prepare for relocation and close down the organization’s six-decade mission.\"I'm appalled by democracy's changes in the last, well, specifically two weeks - but it started a long time ago,\" Margaret Wilmeth said a protester in Ohio was quoted as saying by news agency Associated Press. \"So I'm just trying to put a presence into resistance.\"LIVE: Protest in Philadelphia against Trump's administrationThe protests were organized online under the hashtags #buildtheresistance and #50501, which stands for 50 protests, 50 states, one day.
