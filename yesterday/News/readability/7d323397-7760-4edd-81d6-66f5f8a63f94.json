  "text": "Several MAGA speakers on Sunday hurled racist insults at the illegal immigrants and Vice President Kamala Harris at former President Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally in New York City.During his address, Radio host Sid Rosenberg called to Hillary Clinton as a \"sick bastard\" and a \"sick son of a b*tch\" for drawing parallel between Trump's rally and the infamous 1939 Nazi rally at the Madison Square Garden.Later, Rosenberg said, “You got homeless and veterans, Americans, Americans, sleeping on their own feces on a bench in Central Park. But the f**king illegals, they get whatever they want, don’t they.”Other speakers like David Rem also attacked Harris “the devil” and “the antichrist.” Rem, who at one point waved around a cross, said he was going to run for mayor of New York City.Meanwhile, Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe the host of the podcast \"Kill Tony\" and the first speaker during the programming at Trump's rally, made a controversial remark about Puerto Rico.\"There's a lot going on, like, I don't know if you know this but there's literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. Yeah. I think it's called Puerto Rico,\" Hinchcliffe quipped which elicited laughter from the crowd.Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign quickly responded to Hinchcliffe's comment by posting a video clip on X. On the same day, Harris visited a Puerto Rican restaurant in north Philadelphia, where she addressed the challenges faced by Puerto Rico and discussed her policies focused on the island, including the creation of an opportunity economy task force.The comedian's remarks come at a time when Donald Trump has been referring to the US as \"a garbage can for the world\" while criticizing illegal immigration. The comedian’s comments come as Donald Trump has been calling the US “a garbage can for the world” as he rails against illegal immigration. The former president has said he thinks illegal immigration is the top issue this election and has frequently used dehumanizing language when referring to undocumented immigrants.",
