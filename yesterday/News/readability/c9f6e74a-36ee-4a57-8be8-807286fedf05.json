  "text": "Donald Trump (File photo)President Trump signed pardons for 23 anti-abortion protesters Thursday, White House said, including a set of people convicted of blockading a clinic entrance. The people had been tried for conspiring in 2020 to overrun a Washington reproductive health clinic and setting up a blockade to intimidate patients and staff. \"They should not have been prosecuted,\" said Trump, adding, \"This is a great honour to sign this. They'll be very happy.\"The House, meanwhile, passed legislation that could subject certain doctors to criminal penalties if they perform abortions. The 217-to-204 vote was almost entirely along party lines, save for one anti-abortion Democrat, Henry Cuellar of Texas. But the measure appears doomed in the Senate, where Dems blocked a version of it Wednesday.",
