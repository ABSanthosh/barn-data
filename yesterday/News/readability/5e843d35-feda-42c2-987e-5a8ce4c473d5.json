  "text": "Israeli troops have withdrawn from northern Gaza’s only working hospital, Kamal Adwan, after a days-long raid, the Israel Defense Forces said Monday, adding that its operations were based on intelligence that Hamas was using it as a base.Health workers have been injured and detained, and patients have died in the attack, which began Oct. 25, according to health officials. Only one doctor, a pediatrician, remains in the hospital after Israeli forces detained the rest of the hospital’s medical staff, Gaza’s Health Ministry said Monday.IDF troops have “left the hospital,” Munir al-Bursh, director general of the Gaza Health Ministry, confirmed to The Washington Post on Monday, “but the whole area is surrounded and no one can move.”Talks to reach a cease-fire and hostage deal in the Gaza Strip, the latest effort by the United States to forge a cease-fire after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, continued Monday in Doha. David Barnea, the head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, returned to Israel on Monday after meeting in Doha with CIA Director William J. Burns and Qatar’s ruling emir, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, to discuss a “a new unified framework” for a deal “that integrates previous proposals,” according to a statement from the office of Israel’s prime minister.Discussions between mediators and Hamas are to “assess the feasibility of talks,” according to the statement.On Sunday, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi announced that he has proposed a deal for a two-day cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. He said that four Hamas-held hostages would be released if all parties agreed to it, Egyptian state newspaper Al-Ahram reported.Here are other key developmentsIsraeli troops are continuing operations against Hezbollah and Hamas in southern Lebanon and across Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces said Monday. Hezbollah said it fired missiles and rockets toward northern Israel.Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the IDF chief of staff, warned Sunday that the Israeli military used only “a portion” of its capabilities in its weekend attack on Iran. In a speech Monday at the opening of the Israeli legislature’s winter session, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attack “on dozens of military targets across Iran” had “severely damaged” the country’s “industrial death factories.” Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran would “give an appropriate response” to the strikes, according to state media.At least 43,020 people have been killed in Gaza during the war and 101,110 injured, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. At least 2,672 people have been killed and 12,468 injured in Lebanon, according to the country’s Health Ministry. Both agencies do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack, including more than 300 soldiers. It says 360 soldiers have been killed in its Gaza military operation.Live coverage contributors 6Israeli parliament votes to ban UNRWA within Israel and sever tiesReturn to menuWp logoIsrael’s parliament on Monday passed two laws that severely restrict the activities and privileges of UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, which serves as the primary humanitarian aid provider in Gaza.One law prevents any activity by UNRWA within the territory of Israel; it was passed in a majority vote after its third reading, with 92 of 120 Knesset members approving the law. Another law bans state authorities from contact with UNRWA.The first law means UNRWA will not operate any offices, provide any services or conduct any activities — directly or indirectly — within Israel’s territory. It takes effect in three months.UNRWA would potentially find it impossible to gain entrance permits into Gaza or the West Bank given the new ban on coordination between UNRWA and the Israeli government, including the military and its agency COGAT (the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories), the Times of Israel reported.Asked about the bill to ban UNRWA within Israel at a briefing earlier Monday, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the United States has made clear that it was “deeply concerned” about the proposal.“Passage of this legislation could have implications under U.S. law,” Miller said, adding that Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin raised this issue in a letter to top Israeli officials about two weeks ago. UNRWA plays an “irreplaceable role right now in Gaza,” Miller said.UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said on X after the vote Monday that the laws were “nothing less than collective punishment.” The legislation will “deepen the suffering” of Palestinians, he added. Lazzarini said the bills are part of an ongoing campaign to discredit UNRWA and “delegitimize its role” providing assistance and services to Palestinian refugees.Israel has accused the agency of employing people with ties to Hamas and has called for it to be disbanded. UNRWA in January fired about a dozen staff members accused of taking part in the deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. An independent review of the agency published in April found that Israel had not provided evidence that significant numbers of UNRWA workers are tied to militant groups, but noted that the agency must implement more robust vetting of staff to ensure neutrality.As the draft legislation passed through parliament earlier this month, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres expressed concern that the law would prevent UNRWA from continuing the operations he called “irreplaceable” and “integral” to the humanitarian response in Gaza. He said he wrote directly to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, warning about the effects of the two bills.Hezbollah and IDF trade attacksReturn to menuA series of airstrikes hit Lebanon's historic port city of Tyre on Oct. 28, just hours after Israel placed evacuation warnings on a portion of the city. (Video: Reuters)Hezbollah and the Israel Defense Forces continued to attack each other overnight through Monday, with the IDF announcing strikes in Lebanon’s southern city of Tyre, and Hezbollah announcing attacks on Israeli soldiers at border crossings and an ambush on advancing soldiers.Airstrikes hit Tyre hours after Israel issued evacuation warnings for a large part of the ancient coastal city.In the statement announcing the attacks, IDF said “parts of Tyre have been used as a central stronghold for Hezbollah and its Aziz Unit,” which carries out attacks on Israel. The IDF said it attacked Hezbollah infrastructure including warehouses storing weapons and missiles, military structures and observation posts.The IDF posted a video on X showing several blasts hitting Tyre, including a large building that it said was a “weapons storage facility.”Local TV stations showed footage of large columns of smoke billowing out toward the sea.An earlier strike on Saida, another coastal city in southern Lebanon, killed seven people and wounded 17, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry.Hezbollah also announced several attacks on Israeli military targets, including four separate hits with artillery shells and missile salvos Monday morning on the Fatima Gate border crossing between Israel and Lebanon. The group also announced hits on Israeli border settlements near Al-Manara.Hezbollah ambushed IDF vehicles and soldiers as they advanced toward Tal Nahas in southern Lebanon at 4 a.m. local time on Monday, it said. At the ambush point in the town of Kfar Kila, “the fighters clashed with them with machine guns and rockets,” leading to the burning of two buildings and deaths and injuries among soldiers, Hezbollah said.IDF withdraws from Kamal Adwan Hospital after days-long raid Return to menuThe Israel Defense Forces said Monday that troops have withdrawn from Kamal Adwan Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip after a widely condemned, days-long raid that began Friday.The IDF said its operation at northern Gaza’s only operational hospital last week was based on intelligence that Hamas was using it as a base. Israel has long claimed that Hamas uses medical facilities to operate.Health workers were injured and detained, health officials previously said, and ambulances were damaged in the raid. Two children in the intensive care unit were killed after the generators stopped, Gaza’s Health Ministry said last week. The IDF, in a Monday statement, said it “enabled civilians to leave the hospital” ahead of its operation.A nurse at Kamal Adwan Hospital recalled what happened during an Israeli raid on northern Gaza’s last operational hospital on Oct. 26. (Video: Obtained by Reuters)Munir al-Bursh, the ministry’s general director, told The Washington Post on Monday that IDF troops had “left the hospital, but the whole area is surrounded, and no one can move.”An IDF official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under the ground rules of a news briefing, said Monday that some militants had “disguised themselves as medical staff,” so it was forced to “check the medical staff as well.” A number of militants — including Hamas members who took part in the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel, it said — had “barricaded” themselves inside the hospital, the IDF statement added.An estimated 100 militants were arrested from the compound, the IDF said in its Monday statement, adding that weapons and intelligence documents were found in the surrounding area. Gaza’s Health Ministry said Monday that Israeli troops had arrested and deported so many workers that just one doctor, a pediatrician, remained at the hospital.Employees at Kamal Adwan have long said that the facility, which also served as a shelter for those displaced by Israel’s attacks, was being pushed to the brink of collapse, citing a lack of food, fuel, medicine and other critical medical supplies.Lior Soroka and Abbie Cheeseman contributed to this report.Nearly 1,000 people killed in Israel’s northern Gaza siege, official saysReturn to menuWp logoNearly 1,000 people have died since Israel restarted military operations in northern Gaza in early October, Mahmoud Basal, the spokesman for Gaza’s Civil Defense told The Washington Post on Monday.People have been confirmed dead at northern Gaza hospitals, as well as on the streets and under the rubble, Basal said. The Civil Defense expects the death toll to rise, Basal said, adding: “We will have a greater opportunity to count their numbers more accurately if the army withdraws from these areas and ends its military operations in the northern Gaza Strip.”A top U.N. official warned that civilians in northern Gaza are facing “harrowing levels of death, injury and destruction,” describing “unbearable” conditions, including widespread hunger and disease, amid Israel’s offensive in the area.Conditions in northern Gaza have deteriorated in the three weeks since Israel launched a renewed military offensive in early October. (Video: Joe Snell/The Washington Post)In a Monday statement, Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for U.N. Secretary General António Guterres, condemned Israel’s military operations and said that “repeated efforts to deliver humanitarian supplies essential to survive … continue to be denied by Israeli authorities.”“This conflict continues to be waged with little regard for the requirements of international humanitarian law,” he added.For weeks now, Israel’s military has centered much of its operations in the Gaza Strip on the north, where conditions have rapidly deteriorated and where an estimated 400,000 civilians are living in destroyed buildings and among ruined infrastructure. Israel has said it renewed its offensive in the north to stop Hamas from regrouping there, but several humanitarian officials have since sounded the alarm over mounting civilian casualties and a collapsing health-care system.“The entire population of North Gaza is at risk of dying,” Joyce Msuya, the acting U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs said Sunday, adding that the Israeli military’s actions there “cannot be allowed to continue.”“Shelters have been emptied and burned down,” Msuya added. “First responders have been prevented from saving people from under the rubble. Families have been separated and men and boys are being taken away by the truckload.”Analysis: U.S. election winner will face turmoil in the Middle EastReturn to menuThe deadly cycle of retaliation between Israel and Iran continues to unfold. Israel hit Iranian military targets in a wave of airstrikes in the early hours Saturday, in response to Iran’s Oct. 1 missile barrage against Israel.Israel did not appear to target Iran’s nuclear sites or oil installations, which some analysts interpreted as a move to give Tehran an off-ramp to de-escalate. “The ball is now in the Iranian leadership’s court,” Danny Citrinowicz, senior researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies, told my colleagues.Iranian state media outlets reported the deaths of two soldiers in the Israeli attack, but officials seemed to be trying to downplay the scale of the blow. The country’s Foreign Ministry said Iran was “entitled and obliged to defend itself against foreign acts of aggression.” The Biden administration, which is helping defend Israel from Iran, said it did not participate in the latest Israeli operation.The White House has struggled to contain the fallout of the brutal war between Israel and Hamas. Over and over, top Biden administration officials have shuttled through Amman, Cairo, Doha, Riyadh and Tel Aviv in fitful efforts to chart a path forward. The conflict, which began with the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, has since sprawled across the region, ravaged Gaza, torn through Lebanon, pulled in Iran and its proxy militias, and threatened to explode into a full-blown Israel-Iran war.The next U.S. president, whether it’s Vice President Kamala Harris or former president Donald Trump, will face an Israeli government that “is trying to really redefine the parameters of its conflicts,” Jon B. Alterman, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and director of its Middle East program, told me.Whoever takes office in January will face a region being reshaped by an emboldened Israel and the rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia.This is an excerpt from a full story.Middle East conflict The Israel-Gaza war has gone on for over a year, and tensions have spilled into the surrounding Middle East region.The war: On Oct. 7, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. See photos and videos of how the deadly assault unfolded. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel’s creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.Hezbollah: Hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, a militant organization backed by Iran, have escalated over the past year, leading to an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon. Israel’s airstrikes into Lebanon have grown more intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel’s founding.Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century’s most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including President Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations’ cease-fire resolutions.History: The roots of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and mistrust are deep and complex, predating the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948.
