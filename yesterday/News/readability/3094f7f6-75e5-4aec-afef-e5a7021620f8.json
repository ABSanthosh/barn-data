The meetings came amid rising tensions in Syria and criticism over Israel’s military actions in Gaza.Trump focused on showcasing the benefits of closer economic ties. “Anything they needed, we helped them,” Trump said during the meeting with the Bahraini crown prince. “And anything we needed, they helped us.”In a post on Trurh Social, the MAGA supremo said : \"It was my Great Honor to welcome the Prime Minister and Crown Prince of Bahrain today at the White House. We have had a tremendous relationship with Bahrain over the years—and they have been a fantastic ally!\"Bahrain's $17 billion dealBahrain is a key US ally and hosts the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet. It brings tangible commitments to the table. Crown Prince Al Khalifa said the kingdom had agreed to $17 billion in investments in the United States.“And this is real,” the crown prince said. “It’s real money. These aren’t fake deals.”According to the White House, the investment package includes the purchase of American aircraft, jet engines and computer servers, with potential future deals in aluminium production and artificial intelligence. A separate agreement was also signed to strengthen cooperation on civilian nuclear energy.Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa is expected to visit Washington before the end of the year to further cement ties.Qatar visit follows Trump’s regional tourLater on Wednesday, Trump hosted a dinner for Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. The visit follows Trump’s recent trip to the region, which included stops in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar, where he toured luxurious palaces.Trump has reportedly shown interest in replacing his current presidential aircraft with a lavish Boeing 747 donated by Qatar, as Boeing delays the delivery of new Air Force One planes. However, this idea has raised ethical and security concerns about accepting such a gift from a foreign government.Fighting erupts in SyriaEven as Trump hosted the Gulf leaders, fresh conflict broke out in southern Syria. Clashes between Sunni Bedouin tribes and Druze factions prompted intervention by government forces, triggering concerns in Israel, where the Druze are a politically significant minority.Israel responded with strikes in Damascus on Wednesday. US secretary of state Marco Rubio, who was also present for Trump’s meeting with Al Khalifa, described the Syrian conflict as “an unfortunate situation and a misunderstanding.” He added, “we think we’re on our way to a real de-escalation” that could help Syria start rebuilding after years of war.",
