All of the defendants, except for Cabanes, live in India. Cabanes is a resident of France and Australia, according to prosecutors.The SEC filed civil complaints Wednesday against Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani, as well as against Cabanes, who is an executive at Azure Power Global, in connection with alleged bribery that enabled Adani Green Energy and Azure to capitalize on solar energy contracts awarded by India's government.The SEC's complaints note that during the alleged scheme, Adani Green raised more than $175 million from U.S. investors, and Azure's stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange.\"Gautam and Sagar Adani orchestrated a bribery scheme that involved paying or promising to pay the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to Indian government officials to secure their commitment to purchase energy at above-market rates that would benefit Adani Green and Azure Power,\" the SEC said.\"Cabanes allegedly facilitated the authorization of bribes in furtherance of the scheme while in the United States and abroad,\" the agency said.Gautam Adani is the second-richest person in Asia, with a reported net worth of $85 billion.He lost tens of billions of dollars in personal wealth in early 2023 when the short-selling firm Hindenburg Research published a report accusing the Adani Group of engaging \"in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades.\"Hindenburg's report called it \"the largest con in corporate history.\"Adani issued a 413-page response to Hindenburg, calling the allegations baseless.Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PROWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway takes a stake in Domino's PizzaWall Street is gearing up for an M\u0026A boom under Trump.
