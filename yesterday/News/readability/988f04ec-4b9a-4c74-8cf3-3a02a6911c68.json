All four were abducted from the military base near Gaza where they served during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that began the war.Israel said mediators between the two sides had passed along a list of names of hostages slated for release on Saturday, without confirming their identities. It remained unclear whether the four named by Hamas would ultimately be released.Mediators hope that the six-week truce between Israel and Hamas, which began on Sunday, could lay the foundation for a permanent end to the war in Gaza. But the coming weekend could prove a crucial test for the agreement.Under the terms of the deal, Israel would be expected to release around 200 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the four women hostages on Saturday, including some serving life sentences for involvement in attacks on Israelis.The truce also stipulated that Israeli forces would have to partly withdraw from a wide zone in central Gaza to allow hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to begin heading back to their homes in the devastated north.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
