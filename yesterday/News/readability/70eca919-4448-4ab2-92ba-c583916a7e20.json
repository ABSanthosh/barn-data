An Israeli military official said soldiers fired warning shots.Palestinians pushing a cart with bodies on them after people came under fire near the an aid distribution center in Rafah, Gaza.Credit...Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesJune 1, 2025Updated 6:51 p.m. ETMore than 20 people were killed on Sunday and more than 100 wounded when Palestinians who had gathered overnight in the hope of obtaining food from an aid distribution center in Gaza came under fire, according to local health officials.The incident was the latest episode to ensnarl the Israeli-backed initiative to establish aid distribution sites run by American security contractors in the enclave. The Israeli military initially said it was unaware of any injuries from Israeli fire at the site, but a military official later briefed reporters that troops had fired warning shots toward “suspects” who approached them about a kilometer away.Palestinian paramedics evacuated the bodies of at least 23 people from the vicinity of the distribution center in the southern Gazan city of Rafah, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society. The International Committee of the Red Cross said its field hospital in Rafah had received 179 cases, the majority with gunshot or shrapnel wounds, and said 21 people had been declared dead on arrival. Gaza’s health ministry said 31 had been killed.“All patients said they had been trying to reach an aid distribution site. This is the highest number of weapon-wounded in a single incident since the establishment of the field hospital over a year ago,” the Red Cross said in a statement. Speaking on condition of anonymity to comply with military protocol, the military official said soldiers had acted to prevent several people from approaching the troops when the aid point was not operating, including with “warning shots.”Israeli officials had said the new system of four sites in southern Gaza would prevent Hamas from seizing the food, fuel and other goods, but aid agencies have criticized the initiative.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
