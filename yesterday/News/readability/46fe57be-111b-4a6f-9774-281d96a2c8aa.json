  "text": "International allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad showed support for his regime after rebels breached Aleppo in a major offensive and began a rapid push into northwestern Syria, forcing Russian- and Iranian-backed government forces to retreat in some areas. Assad’s critics, including the United States, reacted to the unfolding situation with caution.Russia, which has participated in strikes against rebel positions alongside Syria’s army, expressed support for Assad’s government. Oleg Ignasyuk, a Russian military official in charge of Syria, said Saturday that Russian forces were fighting in Syria and that “missile and bomb strikes were carried out.”On Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and, according to the Kremlin, they “expressed utmost concern over the dangerous escalation in Syria … and reaffirmed strong support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic.” The two also “agreed on the need to intensify joint efforts so as to stabilize the situation in Syria.”Araghchi went to Damascus, the Syrian capital, to express Tehran’s support for the Syrian army and government on Sunday, state news agency IRNA reported. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also cast the developments as a regional problem, saying he hoped that Islamic countries would help resolve it and that there would be no foreign interference, according to IRNA. Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the United Arab Emirates’ foreign minister, expressed the country’s support for Syria “in the face of extremism and terrorism” during a phone call Sunday with Fuad Hussein, Iraq’s deputy prime minister, his office said in a post on X. The UAE and Syria restored diplomatic relations in 2018. Nahyan’s office added that he wished “continued security, stability and prosperity” for Iraq, which shares a border with Syria. Officials said they have sent reinforcements to the border.Support for Assad’s government also came from farther afield. In Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro’s government issued a statement Saturday labeling the rebels as terrorists and condemning all attacks against the Syrian state.Jordan’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement Sunday that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi spoke with his Syrian counterpart. According to the ministry, Safadi said Jordan was following the developments “with concern,” stated “Jordan’s support for Syria, its territorial integrity, sovereignty, stability and the safety of its citizens,” and “stressed the need … to reach a political solution to the Syrian crisis.”The United States was unsurprised by the rebels having taken action while Assad’s major supporters are distracted by other conflicts, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday. However, he said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he was somewhat surprised by the swiftness of the offensive.The rebels, Sullivan said, referring to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist group based in northwestern Syria’s Idlib province, “took a look at three actors who had been pummeling them for years: Iran, Russia, Hezbollah. They had seen them weaker and more exposed than before, and they tried to take advantage of it.”Also on Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan about the “need for de-escalation and the protection of civilian lives and infrastructure,” according to a State Department spokesperson. The Turkish government supports rebel groups that control areas of northern Syria, including parts of Idlib near the border between the two countries, and some analysts suspect Turkey may have even approved of the military operation.Sullivan said that although the United States has designated HTS a terrorist organization, Washington is not going to lament the fact that the Assad government is facing more pressure. He described it as “a complicated situation,” according to a transcript from CNN.On Sunday, Geir O. Pedersen, the United Nations’ special envoy for Syria, urged de-escalation.“What we see in Syria today is a mark of a collective failure” to bring about a diplomatic solution, he said in a news release, adding that no group of actors could resolve the conflict through military means.",
