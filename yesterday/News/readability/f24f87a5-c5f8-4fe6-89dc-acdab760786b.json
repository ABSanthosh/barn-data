  "text": "Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on Monday called for strong unity among Muslim countries and urged Pakistan to work together to stop what he called the “Zionist regime’s crimes” in Gaza.In a post on X, Khamenei said that “At a time when the warmongers in the world have numerous motives for creating conflicts and wars, the only way to ensure the security of the Islamic Ummah is the unity of Muslim nations”“Pakistan’s stance on the Palestinian issue has been very commendable. While there have always been inducements for Islamic countries to establish ties with the Zionist regime, Pakistan has never been influenced by those inducements,” he added.This comes after Pakistan’s prime minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Tehran, the second stop of his four-country trip. He came from Turkiye and was welcomed by Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian at Saadabad Palace, where he received a guard of honour and held talks with the president.Khamenei also praised the long-standing friendly relations between Iran and Pakistan, highlighting Pakistan’s support during Iran’s war with Saddam Hussein.",
