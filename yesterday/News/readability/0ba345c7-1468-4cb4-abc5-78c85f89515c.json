Zelenskyy, who left Washington DC early following the dispute, was swiftly backed by European allies who reaffirmed their commitment to Ukraine in the ongoing war against Russia.Trump had accused Zelenskyy of \"disrespecting America\" in a Truth Social post minutes after their exchange. European leaders stand by UkraineEU Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas was among the first to respond, vowing to step up aid. “We will step up our support to Ukraine so that they can continue to fight back the aggressor,” she wrote in a post on X. She also noted, “The free world needs a new leader,” adding that Europe must rise to the challenge.Germany’s Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz also expressed his backing, stating on X, “We stand with Ukraine in good and in testing times.” Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz reinforced this stance, writing on X, “Ukraine can rely on Germany and on Europe.”French President Emmanuel Macron made it clear where he stood, stating, “There is one attacker: Russia. There is one people under attack: Ukraine.” His remarks were made while speaking to reporters in Portugal and later reiterated on X.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen echoed the support, addressing Zelenskyy directly in a post on X. “Your dignity honours the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Be strong, be brave, be fearless,” she wrote, promising continued cooperation towards “a just and lasting peace.”Canadian PM Justin Trudeau also took to X to show his support for Ukraine saying, \"Canada will continue to stand with Ukraine and Ukrainians in achieving a just and lasting peace.\"Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk reassured Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people that they were not alone, posting on X, “Dear President Zelenskyy, dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone.” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also expressed solidarity, writing on X, “Ukraine, Spain stands with you” in Spanish, English, and Ukrainian.Germany’s outgoing foreign minister Annalena Baerbock reaffirmed Berlin’s support, stating on X, “Ukraine is not alone. Germany together with our European allies stands united alongside Ukraine – and against the Russian aggression.”Other European leaders also weighed in. Ireland’s Deputy Prime Minister Simon Harris declared on X, “Ukraine is not to blame for this war brought about by Russia’s illegal invasion. We stand with Ukraine.”Sweden’s Prime Minister’s Office posted on X, “Sweden stands with Ukraine. You are not only fighting for your freedom but also for all of Europe’s. Slava Ukraini!”Estonia’s Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna stressed on X that the only barrier to peace was Russia. “If Russia stops fighting, there will be no war. If Ukraine stops fighting, there will be no Ukraine.”Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp also reiterated support, posting on X, “Just spoke to my dear Ukrainian friend and colleague Andrii Sybiha. I reiterated my full support for Ukraine: whatever it takes, for as long as it takes.”Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre and Czech President Petr Pavel also expressed their backing, with Pavel urging on X for Europe to “step up its efforts.”Ukraine’s leadership backs ZelenskyyFollowing the White House clash, key Ukrainian officials voiced their support for their president.

Peace without guarantees is not possible.” Ruslan Stefanchuk, Speaker of the Ukrainian Parliament, declared on X, “Full support for the President of Ukraine! Full support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people! NO ONE has the right to forget that in this war Russia is the aggressor and Ukraine is the victim of aggression.”Trump accuses Zelenskyy of disrespectThe White House meeting saw Trump and US vice president JD Vance accusing Zelenskyy of being ungrateful for US aid. Trump reportedly told Zelenskyy, “You’re not acting at all thankful. It’s not a nice thing,” while also warning, “You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people. You’re gambling with World War III.”After Zelenskyy pushed for stronger security guarantees, Trump broke off talks and later posted on Truth Social: “I have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE.”Zelenskyy, however, appeared to express sarcastic gratitude to the American people after the failed talks, posting on X: “Thank you, America. Thank you for your support. Thank you for this visit. Thank you, US President, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.”As tensions between Kyiv and Washington grow after the White House clash, European leaders are voicing strong support for Ukraine. Many have reaffirmed their commitment to backing Ukraine both militarily and politically, stressing that the country is not alone in its fight against Russian aggression.",
