  "text": "While millions of Canadians cast their ballots today, US President Donald Trump inserted himself into the mix with a jaw-dropping offer. He said Canada could have \"zero tariffs\" and \"free access with no border\" — if it would become \"the beloved 51st state.\"In a flurry of social media posts, Trump asserted that the US could no longer continue to \"subsidize Canada with hundreds of billions of dollars a year\" unless it officially becomes part of the United States. His comments have jolted the election discourse, eliciting scathing criticism from Canadian leaders and reviving debate on sovereignty.Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre fired back bluntly, saying, “President Trump, stay out of our election,” he wrote on X. “Canada will always be proud, sovereign, and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st state.”Mark Carney, Liberal Party leader and former central bank governor, also jumped on Trump's words, cautioning that the US under Trump \"wants to break us, so they can own us.\" Carney has promised to strengthen Canada's domestic trade and international partnerships to cut dependence on its southern neighbor.The Canadian election, fought in large part on such issues as housing, crime, and the rising cost of living, has suddenly assumed international implications. With 343 seats in parliament up for grabs and 172 required to secure a majority, today's result will have much to say about how Canada responds to growing pressure from Washington.Almost 29 million Canadians can vote, with a record 7.3 million having already voted early. The outcome won't merely determine a government — it might chart Canada's response to Trump's brazen proposition.",
