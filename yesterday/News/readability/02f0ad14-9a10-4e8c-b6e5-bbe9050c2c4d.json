  "text": "Ottawa: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday issued a warning regarding the potential imposition of tariffs by the United States, stating that \"Canada will have an immediate and extremely strong response,\" CBC News reported.\"We will continue to do that work and do everything necessary to avoid these tariffs coming in, but like I said, if on Tuesday there are unjustified tariffs brought in on Canada, we will have an immediate and extremely strong response, as Canadians expect,\" Trudeau said.The statement comes amid growing tensions over trade between the two countries. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticised the flow of illicit drugs into the US, allegedly coming from both Canada and Mexico.As a result, Trump has decided to move forward with the imposition of tariffs on both countries, starting March 4. Additionally, reciprocal tariffs are set to continue with full force from April 2.Further, Trudeau added that, \"the first thing on tariffs is to emphasise that our government, and indeed all of Team Canada, premiers, business leaders, community leaders, are focused on one thing, making sure that come Tuesday and for the weeks that follow, there are no tariffs imposed on Canada,\" as per CBC News.\"The tariffs that the president speaks of for next week are centered around the fentanyl crisis that they're facing in the United States, but that we are also facing in Canada,\" he added.Addressing concerns regarding fentanyl trafficking into the United States, he said \"And for months now, I've been emphasising that less than one per cent of the fentanyl that arrives in the United States comes from Canada. But we know that even that one per cent, or less than one per cent, should be reduced, which is why we've invested USD 1.3 billion in strengthening our border capacities with Blackhawk helicopters, with drones, with 10,000 people patrolling our borders and keeping Canadians and Americans safe.\"And that Canada is not the source of problems for the United States,\" he added.Meanwhile, on February 4, the US President paused tariffs on imports from both countries for 30 days, saying that he had secured new commitments from the two countries to improve border security. The pause was put in place after President Trump said he spoke to his counterparts from Mexico and Canada.\"Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels. A large percentage of these Drugs, much of them in the form of Fentanyl, are made in, and supplied by China. More than 100,000 people died last year due to the distribution of these dangerous and highly addictive POISONS,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Citing the smuggling of drugs across the border, Trump has vowed to stop or \"seriously limit\" such drugs, especially Fentanyl.\"Millions of people have died over the last two decades. The families of the victims are devastated and, in many instances, virtually destroyed. We cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH 4 will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,\" read Trump's post.In addition, China will also be charged an additional 10 per cent tariff from March 4.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",
