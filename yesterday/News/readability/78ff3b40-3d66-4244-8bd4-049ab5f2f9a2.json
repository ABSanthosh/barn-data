The New York Times could not immediately independently confirm that Mr. al-Assad was in Russia, which along with Iran had helped keep him in power.The rebel offensive had lasted less than two weeks.The Russian Foreign Ministry said Mr. al-Assad had “decided to leave the presidential post and depart the country” after talks with other “parties to the conflict.” He had given instructions to transfer power peacefully, the ministry said.There was no comment from Mr. al-Assad. His prime minister, Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali, stayed behind and said he was ready to cooperate with the rebels. The opposition forces swept into Damascus with little apparent resistance from the Syrian military, seizing control of government buildings and the state broadcaster.For years, the Syrian civil war — which had erupted in tandem with the anti-government Arab Spring uprisings in 2011 and continued with horrific violence until 2017 — remained unresolved, but relatively stagnant.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
