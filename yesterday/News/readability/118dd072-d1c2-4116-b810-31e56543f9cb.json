While acetone is a common solvent found in chemicals, it can also appear as \"a product of diabetic- and fasting-induced ketoacidosis as well as a metabolite following isopropanol ingestion,\" per the findings.Hackman's toxicology showed acetone levels at 5.3 mg/dL, far higher than the \"normal endogenous acetone levels\" in blood, which top out at just 0.3 mg/dL.The report concluded that these findings were \"consistent with a prolonged level of fasting,\" suggesting the beloved actor may have gone a significant amount of time without eating before he passed.Gene Hackman And Wife Betsy Arakawa's Tragic Final DaysGuerra Jr/The Grosby Group / MEGAHackman and Arakawa were found dead inside their Santa Fe home on February 26 by maintenance workers Jesse Kesler and Roland Lowe Begay. According to a frantic 911 call, Kesler, who had worked as a personal contractor for the couple for 16 years, discovered the scene and immediately called for help.A search warrant affidavit revealed the grim details that Arakawa was found \"decomposed with bloating on her face and mummification in her hands and feet,\" while Hackman showed \"the same signs of decomposition.\"Detectives described the deaths as \"suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation,\" the documents stated.Investigators found rodent nests, feces, and active traps on the property. They also noted that two vehicles, which appeared to be either out of use or designated for farm work, showed evidence of infestation.Although no external trauma was noted on either Hackman or Arakawa, New Mexico authorities quickly launched a criminal probe to ensure no foul play was involved.Betsy Arakawa Searched For Answers Before Her DeathNews Licensing / MEGAJust days before their deaths, Arakawa had desperately been seeking answers about Hackman's declining health. According to documents obtained by TMZ, Arakawa was searching online for symptoms related to COVID-19, including dizziness and nosebleeds.On February 8 and again the morning of February 12, the day she died, Arakawa had multiple browser tabs open about health issues. In an email to her masseuse, the classical pianist revealed that Hackman had woken up on February 11 \"feeling unwell,\" describing his symptoms as cold or flu-like.Though a COVID test came back negative, Arakawa canceled her massage appointment \"out of an abundance of caution.\"Records also showed Arakawa had purchased several Boost Oxygen canisters on February 11.Investigators later reviewed her phone records, voicemails, and security footage, which showed her final online search was for a healthcare provider in Santa Fe.Tragically, it was later revealed that Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but deadly respiratory disease.Gene Hackman And Betsy Arakawa Laid To RestCAMERA PRESS/AFF/MEGAFollowing their tragic deaths, Hackman and Arakawa were quietly laid to rest in a private memorial service in Santa Fe, according to PEOPLE Magazine.The intimate ceremony was attended by Hackman’s three children, Christopher, Elizabeth, and Leslie, as well as close friends.",
