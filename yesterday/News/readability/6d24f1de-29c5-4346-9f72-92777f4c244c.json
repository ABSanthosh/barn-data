  "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to the media in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., on March 26, 2025.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday said he would impose 25% tariffs on \"all cars that are not made in the United States.\"Trump said there is \"absolutely no tariff\" for cars that are built in the U.S.The new tariffs were codified in a presidential proclamation that Trump signed in the Oval Office. They will go into effect April 2, and \"we start collecting April 3,\" he said.Trump White House aide Will Scharf said the new tariffs apply to \"foreign-made cars and light trucks.\" He clarified that they come in addition to duties that are already in place.Scharf said the tariffs will result in \"over $100 billion of new annual revenue\" to the U.S.Specifics about the proclamation were not immediately clear. Most vehicles are assembled from thousands of parts that may originate from dozens of different countries.Trump said there will be \"very strong policing\" on which parts of a car are hit with tariffs.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen quickly criticized the new U.S. tariffs and vowed that the European Union \"will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.\"\"Tariffs are taxes — bad for businesses, worse for consumers equally in the US and the European Union,\" she said in a statement.Auto stocks fell in after-hours trading following Trump's announcement. Shares of General Motors, Stellantis and Ford Motor all lost roughly 5% in extended trading.Trump on March 5 gave those automakers, known as the \"Big Three,\" a one-month exemption from his 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada for vehicles that comply with an existing North American trade deal known as the USMCA.Trump had previously hinted that new auto tariffs could arrive before April 2, the day his sweeping \"reciprocal tariff\" plan is set to begin.\"We'll be announcing that fairly soon over the next few days, probably, and then April 2 comes, that'll be reciprocal tariffs,\" he said at a Cabinet meeting Monday.Trump has long signaled his plans to impose heavy tariffs on foreign trading partners. But his unpredictable and frequently shifting policy rollouts have stirred turmoil in the stock market and left business leaders uncertain about how to plan for the future.A truck carrying vehicles prepares to cross into the U.S. from Canada at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario, on March 8, 2025.Geoff Robins | Afp | Getty ImagesTrump has hyped April 2 as \"liberation day\" and \"the big one.\" His plan, as originally described, would slap reciprocal tariffs on all countries that have their own import duties on U.S. goods, while also imposing tariffs in response to other disfavored trade policies, such as the use of value-added taxes.But Trump and his officials have recently suggested that the tariffs coming April 2 could end up being softer than they first appeared.Trump said Friday that \"there'll be flexibility\" on those tariffs, and on Tuesday night suggested the duties will be more \"lenient than reciprocal.\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that countries can pre-negotiate with the U.S. to avoid facing new tariffs on April 2.This is breaking news.
