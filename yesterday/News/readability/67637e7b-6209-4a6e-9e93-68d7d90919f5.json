  "text": "President-elect Lee Jae-myung arrives to attend a public vote count broadcast event hosted by the Democratic Party near the National Assembly in Yeouido, Seoul, South Korea, on June 4, 2025.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's opposition party leader Lee Jae-myung was elected the new president in a snap election, marking a turning point for the country after months of turmoil following former leader Yoon Suk Yeol's botched martial law imposition.Lee won with 49.42% share of votes, defeating the conservative candidate Kim Moon Soo's share of 41.15%, according to the poll results.The electoral win for the Democratic Party candidate sets him up as the country's next leader for the next five years, who will determine the trajectory of South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S., and policies on China and North Korea. Yoon was impeached after his short-lived declaration of martial law last December, and was removed from office by the country's Constitutional Court in April. This triggered the snap presidential election.Lee, who lost to Yoon by a razor-thin margin in the 2022 presidential election, held a sizable lead in opinion polling ahead of the election.His eligibility for the presidency was in doubt after he was charged with breaching election laws, but a final ruling on the case was postponed until after the election by South Korea's High Court.Consultancy Eurasia Group said that, while Lee had shifted his stance to the political center in a bid to attract independent and centrist votes, he is likely to pursue a more left-leaning agenda in office.\"Key watchpoints include the size of a second supplementary budget and Lee's approach to U.S. tariff negotiations,\" the firm added.Lee will contend with the dual challenges of reviving South Korea's economy and completing a \"package\" agreement with the U.S. by July, Eurasia said.\"However, he has signaled a desire to move more slowly in talks with Washington and will likely seek to benchmark Korea's deal against the terms negotiated by other countries, including Japan, before finalizing an agreement,\" Eurasia noted.Lee had reportedly said on May 25 that the deadline for tariff talks with the U.S. should be extended. Seoul and Washington had agreed to craft a package of deals on tariffs by July 8.Separately, Goldman Sachs, in a May 27 note, also noted that Lee advocates fiscal support for strategic industries and enhancing equity markets through governance reforms.Goldman assessed that fiscal policy — using government spending and taxation to influence the economy — under the DP's Lee is likely to be more expansionary, and that monetary policy by the Bank of Korea will likely partly offset the gap in fiscal policy.The BOK had recently cut rates last week to its lowest level since August 2022, saying it expects economic growth to \"decline considerably.\"Regardless of the election outcome, the South Korean won is likely to appreciate against the U.S. dollar \"on declining policy uncertainties after the formation of a new government and broad USD weakness against Asian currencies,\" Goldman added.",
