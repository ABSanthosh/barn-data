  "text": "South African police have rescued 26 Ethiopians from a suspected human trafficking ring in Johannesburg after the group broke a window and burglar bar to escape from a house where they were being held naked.Three people were arrested on suspicion of people trafficking and possessing an illegal firearm on Thursday night after neighbours in the Sandringham suburb heard the commotion and tipped off the police, the Hawks serious crime unit said in a statement. Police urged the public to report any other escaped naked people in the area.About 60 Ethiopian men were held captive in the bungalow, the local TV station eNCA reported, showing what appeared to be blood spattered below an open window at the front of the house. Police said 11 people were taken to hospital for medical treatment. A number of the Ethiopians have still not been picked up by police.“The signs that we have is this is a human trafficking matter, because they were actually escaping from that house and they were kept naked, almost as if it’s a modus operandi to keep them humiliated and not trying to escape,” said Philani Nkwalase, a police spokesperson.South Africa has attracted immigrants from across Africa since the end of apartheid more than three decades ago. However, fears that they are smuggling drugs and driving up unemployment and violent crime have fuelled persistent xenophobia.There are about 2.4 million foreign-born people in South Africa out of the 62 million population, according to the 2022 census, which aimed to count people regardless of immigration status. While more than three-quarters come from other southern African states, there are about 58,000 Ethiopians in the country.In August 2024, 82 Ethiopians were discovered crammed into a house in the same area of Johannesburg, without enough food or proper toilet and bathroom facilities. Seven of them were initially deemed to be minors and 19 others said they were underage when they were taken to court on suspicion of entering South Africa illegally.“They were all undocumented migrants who were not victims of trafficking but were smuggled into the country,” the department of home affairs said in a statement later that month.Nkwalase said it was not yet clear if the two cases were connected, adding that police were seeking an interpreter as language barriers were preventing officers from getting answers from the men about how, why and when they came to South Africa.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionA neighbour of the house from which the Ethiopians had escaped told eNCA she was shocked by the incident, adding that the only time she had seen anyone at the property was a few weeks ago when her son went to retrieve a ball he had kicked over the fence.",
