  "text": "Honeymoon horror: Newlywed bride mysteriously found dead in Miami (Picture credit: NX)A Polish bride’s dream honeymoon in Miami ended in heartbreak when she was found dead in the street just 23 days after her wedding.Aleksandra Leczycka, 26, and her husband, Dawid Leczycki, had travelled from their hometown of Siedlce, Poland, to celebrate their marriage in Florida. But their dream trip took a devastating turn.On August 29, 2022, the newlyweds were discovered unconscious on a street in Miami. Aleksandra tragically did not survive, while Dawid regained consciousness. Both were found without cash or jewellery, leading local authorities to initially suspect they had been drugged and robbed.However, a two-year re-investigation by Polish prosecutors revealed a different picture.According to the Siedlce District Prosecutor’s Office, Aleksandra’s death was likely caused by the voluntary consumption of psychoactive substances, which may have led to either an overdose or a severe allergic reaction.Prosecutor Krystyna Golabek explained, “Extensive investigative measures were carried out, including a request for legal assistance from the American side, which provided materials from their investigation. Expert opinions in the fields of computer science and toxicology were also obtained.”While the investigators did not entirely rule out the possibility that the couple had been involuntarily drugged, Golabek emphasized that none of the evidence supported the initial hypothesis of forced intoxication.In the hours before her death, Aleksandra shared joyful photos online, sipping cocktails and enjoying the Miami beaches with her husband. These images, posted just before the tragedy, now serve as poignant reminders of the couple’s brief time together after their August 6, 2022, wedding.The re-investigation, which concluded on October 23, 2024, brought clarity to the mysterious circumstances surrounding Aleksandra’s death but left lingering questions about how the psychoactive substances came into their possession.Aleksandra’s husband, Dawid, has remained silent on the events leading to her untimely passing.",
