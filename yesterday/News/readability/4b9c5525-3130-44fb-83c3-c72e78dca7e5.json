  "text": "US President Donald Trump said Friday that Iran’s vulnerabilities—after months of domestic unrest, international sanctions, and military setbacks—could make it more open to discussions. He says diplomacy is his preferred path, though he warned Iran would face \"great danger\" if talks fail. Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump said he wants Iran to be “a wonderful, great, happy country” but repeated that the Islamic Republic must never obtain a nuclear weapon. Talks are set to begin in Oman’s capital, Muscat, where Trump’s middle east envoy Steve Witkoff and Iran’s deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi will be present. It remains unclear whether the discussions will be face-to-face or indirect, as Iran has insisted that only mediated talks are on the table.Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One | Tariff | China | Florida | Trade | Iran The talks come at a moment when Iran is facing enormous challenges. Its proxy groups—Hamas and Hezbollah—have suffered setbacks from Israeli strikes. Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen have also been targeted by US airstrikes. Israel has attacked Iranian military sites, including nuclear-linked facilities. In Syria, President Bashar al-Assad, one of Tehran’s closest allies, was removed from power in December. Domestically, Iran’s economy remains under pressure from years of sanctions, and the US treasury added new ones just this week. Still, Iran continues to enrich uranium well beyond the limits set by the 2015 nuclear deal, and experts warn it has enough material for several nuclear weapons. Trump says he wants full dismantlement of Iran’s nuclear capabilities, but both he and his advisers have signalled flexibility. While Israel’s Prime Minister Netanyahu is calling for a Libya-style deal, Trump appears to prefer a more focused agreement—one that stops Iran from weaponising its nuclear material, without necessarily ending the entire programme.",
