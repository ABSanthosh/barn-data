  "text": "Records reveal Ivanka Trump received money from USAID for a White House program. As the MAGA has trained the guns on the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) which provides humanitarian aid to war-ravaged countries, records claim that Ivanka Trump too received money from USAID. And that too for buying recording equipment for a White House event. According to documents, Ivanka Trump used over $11,000 from the department in 2019 to buy video recording and reproducing equipment for a White House event. The documents show $11,539 was to be used by Ivanka in November 2019 to purchase software, CDs, tapes and records. The purchase was approved by Jenifer Healy, who was serving as USAID deputy chief of staff at the time, and the Administrator's Office. Ivanka Trump who was part of the administration as an advisor in the last Trump administration has not reacted to the claims. After Elon Musk announced that USAID is beyond repair and hence it's best to shut it down, President Donald Trump agreed and said USAID has been run by a \"bunch of lunatics\". The White House released a list of foreign aid programs run by the USAID that included $20 million for a \"new Sesame Street show in Iraq\"; $1.5 million and $5.5 million to promote LGBTQ+ advocacy in Jamaica and Uganda; $6 million for tourists in Egypt etc. The White House also confirmed that media houses like Politico received funds from USAID though Politico denied the claim. USAID sent $1.5 million to advance DEI in Serbia workplaces, $70,000 for a \"DEI musical\" in Ireland and $32,000 for a \"transgender comic book in Peru.\" Reports claimed that other wasteful expenses of USAID included $47,000 on a transgender opera in Colombia, $5 million to EcoHealthAlliance which is one of key NGO \"funding bat virus research at the Wuhan lab\". \"I don't know about you. But as an American taxpayer, I don't want my dollars going toward this crap. And I know the American people don't either. And that's exactly what Elon Musk has been tasked by President Trump to do. To get the fraud, waste and abuse out of the federal government,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",
