Later on Friday, Mr. Trump vented his own frustrations at the way at least one country had failed to respond to American overtures.“If for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we’re just going to say you’re foolish, you’re fools, you’re horrible people, and we’re just going to take a pass,” Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office. “But hopefully we won’t have to do that.”Mr. Trump said the war was costing the lives of 2,500 soldiers every week but has put virtually no pressure on Russia to end the fighting and at one point claimed that Ukraine was responsible for the Russian invasion in 2022.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
