  "text": "A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from ending birthright citizenship for the children of parents who are in the U.S. illegally, issuing the third court ruling blocking the birthright order nationwide since a key Supreme Court decision in June.U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin, joining another district court as well as an appellate panel of judges, found that a nationwide injunction granted to more than a dozen states remains in force under an exception to the Supreme Court ruling. That decision restricted the power of lower-court judges to issue nationwide injunctions.The states have argued Trump's birthright citizenship order is blatantly unconstitutional and threatens millions of dollars for health insurance services that are contingent on citizenship status. The issue is expected to move quickly back to the nation's highest court.White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement the administration looked forward to \"being vindicated on appeal.\"New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin, who helped lead the lawsuit before Sorokin, said in a statement he was \"thrilled the district court again barred President Trump's flagrantly unconstitutional birthright citizenship order from taking effect anywhere.\"\"American-born babies are American, just as they have been at every other time in our Nation's history,\" he added. \"The President cannot change that legal rule with the stroke of a pen.\"Lawyers for the government had argued Sorokin should narrow the reach of his earlier ruling granting a preliminary injunction, saying it should be \"tailored to the States' purported financial injuries.\"Sorokin said a patchwork approach to the birthright order would not protect the states in part because a substantial number of people move between states. He also blasted the Trump administration, saying it had failed to explain how a narrower injunction would work.\"That is, they have never addressed what renders a proposal feasible or workable, how the defendant agencies might implement it without imposing material administrative or financial burdens on the plaintiffs, or how it squares with other relevant federal statutes,\" the judge wrote. \"In fact, they have characterized such questions as irrelevant to the task the Court is now undertaking. The defendants' position in this regard defies both law and logic.\"Sorokin acknowledged his order would not be the last word on birthright citizenship. Trump and his administration \"are entitled to pursue their interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and no doubt the Supreme Court will ultimately settle the question,\" Sorokin wrote. \"But in the meantime, for purposes of this lawsuit at this juncture, the Executive Order is unconstitutional.\"The administration has not yet appealed any of the recent court rulings. Trump's efforts to deny citizenship to children born to parents who are in the country illegally or temporarily will remain blocked unless and until the Supreme Court says otherwise.A federal judge in New Hampshire issued a ruling earlier this month prohibiting Trump's executive order from taking effect nationwide in a new class-action lawsuit. U.S. District Judge Joseph LaPlante in New Hampshire had paused his own decision to allow for the Trump administration to appeal, but with no appeal filed, his order went into effect.On Wednesday, a San Francisco-based appeals court found the president's executive order unconstitutional and affirmed a lower court's nationwide block.A Maryland-based judge said last week that she would do the same if an appeals court signed off.The justices ruled last month that lower courts generally can't issue nationwide injunctions, but it didn't rule out other court orders that could have nationwide effects, including in class-action lawsuits and those brought by states. The Supreme Court did not decide whether the underlying citizenship order is constitutional.Plaintiffs in the Boston case earlier argued that the principle of birthright citizenship is \"enshrined in the Constitution,\" and that Trump does not have the authority to issue the order, which they called a \"flagrantly unlawful attempt to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship based on their parentage.\"They also argue that Trump's order halting automatic citizenship for babies born to people in the U.S. illegally or temporarily would cost states funding they rely on to \"provide essential services\" — from foster care to health care for low-income children, to \"early interventions for infants, toddlers, and students with disabilities.\"At the heart of the lawsuits is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which was ratified in 1868 after the Civil War and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision. That decision found that Scott, an enslaved man, wasn't a citizen despite having lived in a state where slavery was outlawed.The Trump administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship.\"These courts are misinterpreting the purpose and the text of the 14th Amendment,\" Jackson, the White House spokeswoman, said in her statement.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",
