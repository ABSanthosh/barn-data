Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a reading of 93.5.However, the measure for future expectations told an even darker story, with the index tumbling 9.6 points to 65.2, the lowest reading in 12 years and well below the 80 level that is considered a signal for a recession ahead.The index measures respondents' outlook for income, business and job prospects.\"Consumers' optimism about future income — which had held up quite strongly in the past few months — largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers' assessments of their personal situations,\" said Stephanie Guichard, senior economist, global indicators at The Conference Board.The survey comes amid worries over President Donald Trump's plans for tariffs on U.S. imports, which has coincided with a volatile stock market and other surveys showing waning sentiment.The fall in confidence was driven by a decline in those 55 or older but was spread across income groups.In addition to the general pessimism, the outlook for the stock market slid sharply, with just 37.4% of respondents expecting higher equity prices in the next year. That marked a 10 percentage point drop from February and was the first time the view turned negative since late 2023.The view on the labor market also weakened, with those expecting more jobs to be available falling to 16.7%, while those expecting fewer jobs rose to 28.5%.
