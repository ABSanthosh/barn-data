Producer Trevor Horn has mashed up three sets of performances into a new “Ultimate Mix”, which will be released on 25 November, and also features George Michael, Robbie Williams, Sinéad O’Connor and many more.Writing on Instagram, Sheeran said: “My approval wasn’t sought on this new Band Aid 40 release and had I had the choice I would have respectfully declined the use of my vocals. A decade on and my understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed.”Sheeran shared a post by British-Ghanaian vocalist Fuse ODG, saying it “eloquently explained” his feelings about the song.Fuse ODG wrote of charity initiatives such as Band Aid: “While they may generate sympathy and donations, they perpetuate damaging stereotypes that stifle Africa’s economic growth, tourism and investment, ultimately costing the continent trillions and destroying its dignity, pride and identity. By showcasing dehumanising imagery, these initiatives fuel pity rather than partnership, discouraging meaningful engagement.”Fuse ODG said he wanted to “reclaim the narrative … today, the diaspora drives the largest flow of funds back into the continent, not Band Aid or foreign aid, proving that Africa’s solutions and progress lie in its own hands”.Band Aid has raised over £150m since being founded in 1984, including via the song – which topped the charts on each of its three releases – and the US-UK benefit concerts Live Aid. It originally targeted famine relief in Ethiopia and has since expanded to charitable efforts across Africa.But the song has been criticised for a paternalistic and generalising attitude towards Africans, and had its lyrics changed in 2014, including Bono’s climatic line “Well tonight thank God it’s them, instead of you” which was changed to “Well tonight we’re reaching out and touching you”.Fuse ODG was invited to appear on that version, but declined, writing in the Guardian at the time: “I, like many others, am sick of the whole concept of Africa – a resource-rich continent with unbridled potential – always being seen as diseased, infested and poverty-stricken.”Sheeran is gearing up to release his own Christmas song, Under the Tree, taken from the soundtrack to new Netflix film That Christmas, co-written by Richard Curtis and adapted from his children’s books. It stars Brian Cox as Santa Claus, with Jodie Whittaker, Fiona Shaw and Bill Nighy among the supporting cast.",
