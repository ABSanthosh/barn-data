High winds and strong water currents disrupted the rescue effort, as the conditions often made it unsafe to fly a helicopter to the scene.On Sunday, the sheriff's office confirmed that the individuals were deceased.“It is with heavy hearts that we share the bodies of the three men have been recovered,” the office said in a statement.\"Our heartfelt condolences go out to their families, friends, and all those affected by this tragic loss.”A diver tasked with locating the bodies described the terrain and challenge of navigating the hiking spot as \"brutal.\"\"[The waterfall] kept pushing me down but I wasn’t leaving without bringing those 3 souls home to their families,\" said diver Juan Heredia on Facebook following the discovery.\"Josh Robinson our team backup diver, and I hiked over 3 hours just to reach that 47-foot deep pool. I dove four times — close to 3 minutes each — freezing cold water and deep.\"Placer County officials warn that the water in Rattlesnake Falls is extremely cold, and that the sudden change in temperature that occurs when one enters that water can lead to shock.“An immediate danger of jumping into swift waterways is cold shock,” the county explains on its website.“Cold shock occurs when the body is exposed to cold water, resulting in a rapid loss of breathing control, increased heart rate and a gasp reflex. This can lead to involuntary gasping and hyperventilation, which can cause drowning.”The identities of the deceased individuals have yet to be released. Rest in peace to the three adventurers, and we send our condolences to their families, friends and loved ones.3 Men Jumped Into Water at Popular Hiking Spot.
