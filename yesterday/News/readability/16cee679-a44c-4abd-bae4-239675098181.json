But it has long resisted giving money directly to Ukraine for weapons, instead portraying its support for Kyiv in the war as a way to support American companies and minimize the potential for corruption. U.S. military aid packages to Ukraine have shrunk recently, partly because of concerns about dwindling Pentagon stockpiles.In April, Denmark became the first country to join a Ukrainian campaign called Manufacturing Freedom, which aims to raise $10 billion for the production of Ukrainian weapons. The Danish government agreed to give about $28.5 million to buy weapons from Ukrainian manufacturers. Canada and the Netherlands later signed on.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
