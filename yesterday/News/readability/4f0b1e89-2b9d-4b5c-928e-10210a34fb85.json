  "text": "Donald Trump at the Kennedy Center in Washington with Melania TrumpDonald Trump has reiterated his hard stance on Iran’s nuclear ambitions, stating that the United States will not allow the Middle Eastern nation to possess nuclear weapons. His comments came just as the US ordered a partial evacuation of its embassy in Iraq, citing rising security concerns in the region.Speaking to reporters at the Kennedy Center in Washington alongside his wife Melania, the US president said, “They can't have a nuclear weapon. Very simple. They can't have a nuclear weapon. We're not going to allow that.”Trump’s statement follows growing tensions amid failed diplomatic efforts to reach a nuclear deal with Iran. Despite five rounds of talks since April, no agreement has been reached, with uranium enrichment remaining the main point of contention. The MAGA chief told a New York Post podcast released on Wednesday that his hopes for a deal were fading. “I did think so, and I'm getting more and more -- less confident about it,” he said, adding, “Something happened to them. But I'm much less confident about a deal being made.”The US State Department confirmed on Wednesday that most American diplomats were being withdrawn from Baghdad and Erbil due to unspecified threats. “President Trump is committed to keeping Americans safe, both at home and abroad. In keeping with that commitment, we are constantly assessing the appropriate personnel posture at all our embassies,” the department said. It added, “Based on our latest analysis, we decided to reduce the footprint of our mission in Iraq.”US defence secretary Pete Hegseth has also authorised the voluntary departure of US military dependents across the Middle East, as reported by Politico. Meanwhile, Iran’s defence minister Aziz Nasirzadeh has warned of a strong military response if attacked. “All of its bases are within our reach; we have access to them, and we will target all of them in the host countries with no hesitation,” he was quoted as saying to Radio Free Europe.On social media, Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araqchi acknowledged Trump’s demand. “That is actually in line with our own doctrine and could become the main foundation for a deal,” he posted on X, but insisted a “mutually beneficial outcome” would require the continuation of Iran’s enrichment programme under UN supervision and the lifting of sanctions.The next round of talks is scheduled for June 15 in Oman. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rejected a recent US proposal, calling it “100 percent” against national interests.Separately, the US and European allies have submitted a resolution at the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors, potentially referring Iran to the UN Security Council. If passed, it would mark the first such move in two decades and could reimpose sanctions lifted under the 2015 deal that Trump withdrew from during his presidency.Iran has warned that if the resolution is adopted, it will further escalate its nuclear programme. The IAEA meeting concludes on June 13",
