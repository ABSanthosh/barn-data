Of him it will be said that he weakens his see… but long will he sit and in biting activity.”He then added, “In the final persecution of the Holy Roman Church, there will sit Peter the Roman, who will pasture his sheep in many tribulations, and when these things are finished, the city of seven hills will be destroyed, and the dreadful judge will judge his people. The End.”The latest of his vague and sometimes obvious predictions which heretics have latched onto is Pope Francis’ “critical condition.” AFP via Getty ImagesPope Francis is currently on his 10th day of hospitalization for complications from a lung infection that has caused the early stages of kidney insufficiency, the Vatican said.The 88-year-old is said to remain in critical condition although “the night passed well” and he remains in good spirits.Medical professionals have warned that his condition is unstable due to his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease.Back in the 16th century, Nostradamus predicted: “Through the death of a very old Pontiff… a Roman of good age will be elected. Of him it will be said that he weakens his see… but long will he sit and in biting activity.” AFP via Getty ImagesIn New York on Sunday, Cardinal Timothy Dolan acknowledged Catholics were united “at the bedside of a dying father.”“As our Holy Father Pope Francis is in very, very fragile health, and probably close to death,” Dolan said, later adding that he hoped and prayed that Francis would “bounce back.”The pope’s worsening health has raised questions about the Catholic church’s succession plan.However, skeptics question how shocking Nostradamus’ claims are. Is it a shock a “very old Pontiff” would die and give way to a “Roman of good age” in Rome?",
