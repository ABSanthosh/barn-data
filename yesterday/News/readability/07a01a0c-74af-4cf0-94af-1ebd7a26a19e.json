  "text": "Attack in Boulder, Colorado (Image credits: X @OpusObscuraX)Several people were injured on Sunday in Boulder, Colorado in what the FBI described as targeted terror attack after a man threw something resembling Molotov cocktails near pro-Israeli protesters. Police confirmed that some victims appeared to have been set on fire.The police have taken a man into custody, suspected of the attack on Pearl Street Mall in Boulder. Boulder police chief Stephen Redfearn refused the FBI's claims, saying that it is too early in the investigation to make that determination. “It would be irresponsible for me to speculate on motive this early on.”At the time of the attack, demonstrators with the group 'Run For Their Lives' had gathered at the location to call for the release of hostages held in Gaza. The group holds regular walks around the world to advocate for hostage releases.Authorities have not officially confirmed the suspect’s identity, but prominent accounts on X, including Raws Alerts and political commentator Laura Loomer, have named a person called Mohamad Soliman as the alleged attacker.A video, apparently filmed during the incident, shows a shirtless man holding spray bottles as a fire burns on the grass in front of him. He is heard yelling, “End Zionists!”, “Palestine is Free!” and “They are killers!” toward people in red t-shirts tending to someone lying on the ground. In another video shared on X, the same man is seen arguing with bystanders, saying at one point, “I can, I can.”Police said the injuries ranged from minor to serious and were consistent with reports of people being set on fire. Multiple blocks around the 13th and Pearl Streets were evacuated as law enforcement officers, including K-9 units, searched the area and warned the public to stay clear.FBI director Kash Patel said agents were already on the scene and that updates would be shared as more information becomes available.The attack comes amid a rise in antisemitic violence across the US. Last week, a man was arrested after fatally shooting two Israeli embassy staffers and shouting “Free, Free Palestine” as he was detained.Colorado governor Jared Polis said he was “closely monitoring” the situation and condemned the violence. “Hate-filled acts of any kind are unacceptable,” he said.",
