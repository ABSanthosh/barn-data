  "text": "Kash Patel clarifies that he is not going to resign. FBI director Kash Patel issued a statement and dispelled rumors that he was going to resign over the Epstein fallout. Without mentioning anything about Epstein, Attorney General Pam Bondi or his deputy Dan Bongino, Patel wrote: The conspiracy theories just aren’t true, never have been. It’s an honor to serve the President of the United States @realDonaldTrump — and I’ll continue to do so for as long as he calls on me.\"Kash made the post for his personal verified X account, not the FBI director one, amid a major fallout between the DOJ and the FBI over the Epstein case.The controversy started Friday after MAGA activist, popularly referred to as Trump whisperer, Laura Loomer reported first that Dan Bongino was considering resigning from his post after a massive clash with Pam Bondi. Axios confirmed the clash and reported that Dan Bongino stormed out of the White House meeting Wednesday and has not reported to work since then. 'She goes of I go,\" Bongino apparently said to his aides about Pam Bondi. This triggered speculations that Kash Patel, too, has threatened to resign, as many MAGA theorists said if Bongino leaves, Kash will also leave. Kash Patel, Dan Bongino and Pam Bondi have come under fire over the Epstein case -- for different reasons. Patel and Bongino were the conspiracy theorists before joining the administration who believed that much information had been kept secret from people. Pam Bondi after joining the administration, overpromised as she categorically said she had the Epstein client list sitting on her table for review. But now the FBI and DOJ claimed that there was no client list and Pam Bondi said she earlier meant documents, not any specific client list. She asserted that they reviewed many documents, which they did not release,e as those are child pornography. Kash Patel's personal life has been dragged into controversy as MAGA activists claimed Kash Patel had interest in suppressing Epstein documents as his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins was linked to Israel. Wilkins rubbished the speculations and said people were spinning ridiculous theories out of thin air to get social media engagement.",
