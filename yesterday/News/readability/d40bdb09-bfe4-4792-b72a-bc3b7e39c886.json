  "text": "The streaming service Mubi has canceled a film festival slated to take place in Istanbul after the Turkish government banned the event’s opening film, a gay romance.According to Mubi, Turkish authorities banned the film “Queer” out of concern that its “provocative content” would “endanger the peace of society.” The streaming service said Thursday that the ban came just hours before the festival was set to begin.“We believe this ban is an intervention that restricts art and freedom of expression,” Mubi said in a statement posted to its Turkish-language Instagram page. “Festivals are breathtaking spaces where art and cultural diversity are celebrated, bringing people together.” The streaming service said it hoped to model the “right stance” on the subject of “protecting freedom of expression and artistic expression” by canceling the event.Turkey has previously banned films and events that included LGBTQ+ subject matter.“Queer” is directed by Luca Guadagnino, who also directed the critically acclaimed “Call Me By Your Name.” It is based on the autobiographical novel by William S. Burroughs, the Beatnik postwar writer.The film stars former James Bond actor Daniel Craig as a lonely, middle-aged gay man in Mexico City who becomes involved in a heated romance with a young military veteran played by Drew Starkey, a star of the hit Netflix series “Outer Banks.”The film received a nine-minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival in September.The canceled event in Istanbul is part of a multi-city international tour that combines film screenings with other live events for attendees. The tour visited cities including Chicago; São Paulo, Brazil; and Bogotá, Colombia, before arriving in Istanbul, its penultimate stop.",
