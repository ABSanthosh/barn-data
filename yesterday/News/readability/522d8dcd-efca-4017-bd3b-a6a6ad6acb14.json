Mr. Prince’s team has been operating the drones since March, but the authorities have yet to announce the death or capture of a single high-value target.Security experts said Mr. Prince has also been scouting Haitian American military veterans to hire to send to Port-au-Prince and is expected to send up to 150 mercenaries to Haiti over the summer. He recently shipped a large cache of weapons to the country, two experts said.The Haitian government is awaiting the arrival of arms shipments and more personnel to step up its fight against the gangs.American officials said they were aware of Mr. Prince’s work with Haiti’s government. But the full terms of the Haitian government’s arrangement with Mr. Prince, including how much it is paying him, are unknown.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
