Amid speculations over their growing distance and impending divorce, now reports claim that the royal couple are far from being separated and are actually buying a joint property in Portugal. They have not had a home in Europe since they were asked to vacate their Frogmore Cottage in 2023, years after they quit their royal duties. Vogue reported that they have chosen Portugal's Melides to be close to Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank -- in a snub to the broader royal family.On safety aspects too, Portugal is safe for the couple as it is the seventh safest country in the world. The report comes amid their divorce speculations -- kind of negating those rumors as a warring couple would not go for a joint purchase. It might be a PR move also to plant the to suppress the divorce speculations which became intense in the last few weeks as Harry and Meghan have been leading separate lives -- professionally. Harry was on a whirlwind tour covering New York, London, South Africa while Meghan was seeing solo in California. Reports said they were on a separation trial but the news of the new home in Portugal may put the rumors to rest for the time being.Harry reportedly has been longing to return to home and this purchase could be the closest to that wish. Royal experts are also aware that Harry and Meghan are buying a house in Portugal and they believe that King Charles' message to them would be of indifference. King Charles is not going to \"concern himself\" with the news, experts claimed. King Charles evicted them from their Windsor property after they left the family and defamed the family in the public but the King will not be perturbed by the news. The King's got a lot of things to get on with. Apart from getting well, he's got his big tour to Australia,\" royal expert Hugo Vickers told the Sun. \"He's got all the things that kings have to do, and I suspect the message we're getting is that Harry just needs to sort himself out.\"King Charles and Queen Camilla touched down in Sydney on Friday evening as their six-day royal tour begins. The King ahs paused his cancer treatment for this tour.",
