  "text": "ROME — Pope Francis is expected to be discharged on Sunday from the Rome hospital where he spent five weeks battling the most severe health crisis of his papacy, Francis’s doctors said on Saturday.The 88-year old pope will return to his home at a Vatican City boardinghouse for what his doctors described as a “convalescence” of at least two months.Francis, who was admitted to Rome’s Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic on Feb. 14 with a respiratory infection that was later diagnosed as double pneumonia, faced two life-threatening episodes during his hospitalization, doctors said. His condition has been stable for two weeks, doctors said, and the pope was eager to be released.“The good news that the world has waited for has arrived. The pope will be released tomorrow,” Sergio Alfieri, a surgeon at Rome’s Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic and one of the pope’s attending physicians.Francis, his doctors said, will still require the use of supplemental oxygen and respiratory and physical therapy once released, though such care will be provided within the confines of his rooms at Casa Santa Marta, his Vatican City home. While the most severe lung infections have been cured, his doctors noted that some “viral loads” have merely been reduced, and will require further treatment with drugs in a home setting.Francis is “not completely cured of all microbial species,” Alfieri said. “It will take some time.”The pope’s doctors estimated that Francis would be able to return to some normal activities within a “short time.” He had already resumed working during his hospitalization, they noted.Ahead of his release, the Vatican said Francis would make an appearance and offer a greeting at the Gemelli hospital during his regular Angelus prayer on Sunday. However, he will not be immediately able to resume working with “groups of people,” or preside over certain “important commitments,” his doctors said.Francis has lost much of his voice, doctors said, noting that this is normal for patients — especially elderly ones — recovering from a life-threatening case of pneumonia.“It will take some time for the voice to return to what it was before,” said Sergio Carbone, one of the Pope’s personal physicians. “Compared to ten days ago, we have already recorded significant improvements.”Alfieri said Francis “wanted to go home a few days ago” but realized that while his condition was improving, he required further hospitalization. Doctors, he said, had now determined that he had reached a point where his recovery outside a hospital setting was preferred.“Further progress [will need happen] at home, since the hospital, though it may seem strange to say it, is the worst place for a convalescence, because it’s where you get the most infections,” Alfieri said.He said they knew Francis had reached a certain level of recovery when he returned to deploying dark humor with medical staff.“‘Holy Father, how are you?’” Alfieri said doctors asked Francis. “When he responded ‘I’m still alive,’ we figured out that, essentially, he was fine, and he had also regained his good mood.”In the past week, Buckingham Palace confirmed that Britain’s King Charles would continue with a three-day state visit to Vatican City and Italy set to start on April 7 and that a tentative audience had been arranged with Francis. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni, who addressed the media on Saturday with Alfieri and Carbone, did not explicitly commit to meeting with the British monarch.Signaling a measure of optimism about the pope’s recovery, however, Carbone said he hoped Francis would be well enough to carry out a planned trip to Turkey at the end of May to commemorate the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, the church’s first ecumenical council.“We’ll see about it based on what the progress will be,” Bruni said of the Turkey trip.Even as Francis recovers now, his weakened condition has amounted to a reality check for the Roman Catholic church, sparking growing debate, both publicly and privately within the Holy See, over his possible successor.Francis, who had part of one lung removed in his youth, has been prone to battles with bronchitis, and doctors have warned that his weakened state remains cause for concern going forward.Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, the chief doctrinal officer at the Vatican and a close ally of Francis, offered candid comments on Friday about the pope’s longer-term outlook.He said the extended use of non-mechanical ventilation and high-flow oxygen use had essentially made it so that Francis needs to “learn to speak again, almost.”He appeared to confirm reports that Francis, before his hospitalization, had for days refused the entreaties of his medical team for in-patient care for his respiratory crisis.“Some very close friends [of his] … convinced him” to go to the hospital, Fernández said. “They finally went: ‘no, no, no, no, no, you need to go.’ I don’t know what swear words they used. ... They convinced him to go. Imagine how hard it must be for him. But he is one of those [old school] Jesuits who have an immense strength, and a capacity for sacrifice.”Speculation has run rampant that Francis, if he finds himself too ill, would choose to retire, effectively following in the footsteps of his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who was the first pontiff in nearly 600 years to take that step.In the past, Francis has not ruled out that possibility — but has also said that he sees papacy as a job for life.Fernández at one point suggested the pope had told himself that “what little time” he had left shouldn’t be spent receiving treatment in a hospital.At home, he predicted the pope may take on a lighter workload — at least for a short time.Asked if he foresaw Francis stepping down, Fernández said he didn’t. “Rather, I believe that this time of pain, tiredness, limitation, is but the beginning of a new stage, which will certainly be fruitful, and will be part of his pontificate,” Fernández said. “This is what I was hoping for all along. That this wouldn’t be the end, but that there would be this new stage, where the Pope will surely continue to give us much.”",
