  "text": "Subway murder suspect Sebastian Zapeta’s drunken rant goes viral in shocking video.A chilling new video has surfaced online, allegedly showing Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, the man accused of setting a woman on fire aboard a New York City subway, spewing a drunken rant about alcohol and locals. In the clip, the man can be heard talking about “drinking beer” and saying, “I don’t give a s**t about people.” While much of the footage is unintelligible, one user noted, “At the very beginning, he says ‘estas bien a verga loco,’ meaning he is very, very high.”The video, shared by a social media user who claimed it depicts Zapeta-Calil, comes in the aftermath of the horrific attack. Authorities have not yet confirmed the video’s authenticity, but the reaction online has been swift, with many users calling for harsh punishment. One commented, “He sat there and watched her. He’s a total sociopath.” Another added, “It’s unfortunate that New York does not have the death penalty.”What do we know about the case?The suspectSebastian Zapeta-Calil, 33, a Guatemalan immigrant who had previously been deported in 2018, was arraigned on murder and arson charges on Tuesday. Federal immigration officials confirmed he re-entered the US illegally, though the timeline remains unclear.Authorities allege Zapeta calmly approached the victim aboard a stationary F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station on Sunday morning. He set her clothing ablaze and fanned the flames with a shirt as she burned to death.Zapeta was arrested hours after police released surveillance images. Three high schoolers recognized him and alerted officers, who found him wearing the same paint-splattered pants and tan boots seen in the footage. During interrogation, Assistant District Attorney Ari Rottenberg said Zapeta identified himself in images of the attack but claimed he didn’t know what happened, admitting to regular alcohol consumption.The victimThe woman has not yet been identified. Authorities said she was seated at the end of the train car when the attack occurred. NYPD Chief of Transit Joseph Gulotta stated that there was no prior interaction between the suspect and the victim.Details from a shelter roommateSebastian Zapeta-Calil’s disturbing behavior reportedly escalated after using K2, a synthetic drug, and drinking heavily. “He smoked K2, drank, and bugged out,” said his shelter roommate Raymond Robinson, speaking to The New York Post. Robinson described Zapeta as erratic when high but otherwise coherent. “When he wasn’t high, he’d talk like we’re talking regular.”On the day of the attack, Robinson recalled Zapeta having a normal breakfast at the shelter and saying, “I am going out to make my normal run.” Hours later, police allege, he carried out the horrific act, leaving even his roommate stunned.The attackThe victim, yet to be identified, was sitting quietly on a stationary F train at the Coney Island station around 7:30 amon Sunday. Police say Zapeta approached her without a word, set her clothing on fire, and fanned the flames with a shirt. Video evidence reportedly shows him standing by as she burned to death.The broader impactPolice Commissioner Jessica Tisch called the crime “one of the most depraved crimes one person could possibly commit against another human being.” Online reactions echoed similar sentiments, with one user questioning, “When will the American people demand repercussions from those who funded and allowed the flood?”Violent subway incidents like this continue to draw national attention. Despite a 6% drop in overall subway crime this year compared to 2023, murders in the system have risen, with nine recorded so far in 2024 compared to five in the same period last year.New York Mayor Eric Adams acknowledged the impact of such incidents, saying, “When you have these incidents, it overshadows the success, and it plays on the psyche of New Yorkers.” He also pointed to the involvement of mental health issues in many high-profile crimes on the transit system.The next court hearing for Zapeta is scheduled for Friday as New Yorkers await further updates on the case.",
