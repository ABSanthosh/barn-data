  "text": "A recent breach of Berkshire Hathaway-owned private jet company NetJets has revealed a guide for flight attendants serving Elon Musk, per a Bloomberg report. The memo offers an interesting glimpse into the personal preferences of the world’s richest man. Some of the preferences are surprising for the CEO of Tesla, a company dedicated to sustainability. Apparently Musk isn’t “interested in conserving fuel” because he “wants to fly as quickly and as direct” as possible. Other inclinations are not surprising at all, like the note to staff not to offer him technical help. “Mr. Musk considers himself self-sufficient and does not need help with technology — if he does, he will ask.” And then there’s the relatable stuff, like his dislike of unexpected Wi-Fi outages and his penchant to take a nap, even on day trips. He also prefers to keep the cabin at 65 degrees, the lights dim, and the passenger vents off because he “does not like the noise.”",
