  "text": "A family of four, including a pregnant mother and two young children, were found dead in their home Friday morning in an apparent murder-suicide, the New York Post reports.Police identified Nicholas Arruda, 39, as the shooter.Authorities discovered the bodies of Arruda, his wife Danielle, 39, and their two children, ages 2 and 5, after conducting a welfare check at their Cheyenne Trail residence. Danielle had not reported to work for several days, prompting colleagues to raise concerns.According to police chief Richard Ramsay, all four victims were found in their pajamas. “We believe it is the weapon used in the murder/suicide,” police said in a statement. “However, a formal firearms examination has not yet been conducted.” The chief described the scene as “one of the worst” in his 30-year career. Danielle was seven months pregnant.The family moved into the home in 2019. The couple were high school sweethearts and married in 2017. Nicholas Arruda had a prior arrest for felony assault roughly 11 years ago, stemming from a previous relationship. He worked as a painter but had been unemployed for several years due to a back injury. Chief Ramsay said, “He was a stay-at-home dad who was homeschooling the children.”While there were no prior police calls to the residence, and no known history of domestic issues, the investigation is ongoing. Danielle was last seen on New Year’s Day purchasing heating pellets. Chief Ramsay noted that there were no apparent signs of conflict within the family, adding the couple appeared to have “loved one another and they loved their children.”",
