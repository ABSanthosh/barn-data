  "text": "Melinda Gates said Bill Gates' association with Jeffrey Epstein was one of the reasons behind their divorce. The old video of Melinda French Gates from 2022 in which Melinda called Jeffrey Epstein 'evil personified' went viral Monday after the US administration brought the curtains down on the Epstein case. In the interview, Melinda blamed Bill Gates' relationship with convicted pedophile Epstein as one of the reasons for their divorce. Melinda revealed in the CBS interview that she had met Epstein once, as she wanted to see who this person was. \"And I regretted it the second I stepped in the door. He (Epstein) was abhorrent. He was evil personified. I had nightmares about it afterwards, so my heart breaks for these young women,\" Melinda said adding that she made it clear to Bill that she did not like Epstein and his association with Epstein at all.Melinda wrote about this experience in her memoir \"The Next Day\" that in 2019, NYT published a deeply disturbing article suggesting that Bill Gates had not only betrayed the marriage but also Melinda's values. NYT also reported that Epstein threatened to expose Bill's alleged affair with Russian bridge player Mila Antonova in 2017, after Bill declined to join Epstein’s multi-billion-dollar charitable fund with JPMorgan Chase.But Bill Gates was not accused of any sex offence and also expressed regret for his association with Epstein. \"In retrospect, I was foolish to spend any time with him. I think I was quite stupid. I thought it would help me with global health philanthropy. In fact, it failed to do that. It was just a huge mistake,\" Bill Gates said. Bill and Melinda finalized their divorce in August 2021 after 27 years of their marriage. While Americans expected many more big names to come out of the stacks of files and documents and the exact nature of their relationship with Epstein, the FBI and the Department of Justice issued a joint an unsigned memo announcing that there was no incriminating Epstein client list. The investigation also concluded that Epstein died by suicide and was not murdered in jail. MAGA activists had a major meltdown over the announcement and they called it a cover-up.",
