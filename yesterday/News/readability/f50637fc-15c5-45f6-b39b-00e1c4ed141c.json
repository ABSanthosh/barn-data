Some of them are so bad we don't even trust the countries to hold them, because we don't want them coming back,\" Trump said.The unexpected declaration came during the signing of Lake Riley Act permitting pre-trial confinement of illegal migrants accused of theft and violent offences. Lake Riley was an American nursing student who lost her life at the hands of a Venezuelan immigrant.The Republican during the White House event disclosed signing an executive directive instructing the Pentagon and Homeland Security department to \"begin preparing the 30,000-person migrant facility at Guantanamo Bay.\"He further said that this would instantly double their capacity for holding illegal migrants, as part of an extensive enforcement initiative promised for the beginning of his second term.Describing Guantanamo as a \"tough place to get out of,\" Trump indicated that Wednesday's measures would \"bring us one step closer to eradicating the scourge of migrant crime in our communities once and for all.\"The White House ceremony included the attendance of Laken Riley's parents. \"We will keep Laken's memory alive in our hearts forever,\" Trump said. \"With today's action, her name will also live forever in the laws of our country, and this is a very important law.\"",
