  "text": "A pet groomer in North Carolina has been arrested after disturbing videos surfaced showing her punching and slamming dogs during grooming sessions. Kirsten Rhea Taylor, 28, was taken into custody on Thursday in Mooresville and charged with four counts of felony animal cruelty, reported New York Post. Authorities identified her as the employee seen in videos recorded at Classy Critters, a local pet grooming business. The footage was captured by a co-worker and posted to Facebook, sparking public outrage and prompting an immediate investigation by Iredell County Animal Services. The videos reportedly show Taylor hitting dogs multiple times and roughly handling them, including slamming one frightened dog against a wall. At least four client-owned dogs were seen being treated aggressively, police said. Due to the serious nature of the allegations, the case was handed over to the sheriff’s office, which later issued arrest warrants. The owner of Classy Critters confirmed that Taylor no longer works at the facility. Her bail has been set at $10,000.",
