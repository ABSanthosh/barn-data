  "text": "Jane Gardam, whose witty and perceptive novels explored the pangs of young love, the disappointments of old age and the twilight of the British Empire, died April 28 in Chipping Norton, in the Cotswolds region of England. She was 96.A spokeswoman for her publisher, Little, Brown Book Group, confirmed the death but did not cite a cause.Ms. Gardam started writing relatively late, raising three young children before publishing her first book at 43. She went on to produce more than two dozen novels, story collections and children’s books, gaining a following for work that was often darkly comic, satirizing status-conscious aristocrats and the upper-middle classes while grappling with the legacies of British imperialism and World War II.“As the best artists do, she offers hard truths in a pleasurable way,” novelist Susan Minot wrote in a 2022 essay for the Paris Review. “There is no overindulgence. Sensuous details are side by side with a sharp intelligence. … Philosophical musings merge into social commentary, but you notice no intrusion because you are mesmerized by the story. The story is everything.”Ms. Gardam won the Whitbread prize, one of Britain’s most prestigious literary awards, for her children’s book “The Hollow Land” (1982) and her epistolary novel “The Queen of the Tambourine” (1991), which traced an unhappily married woman’s descent into madness.But she was perhaps best known for “Old Filth” (2004), a tragicomic novel that told the story of a retired barrister, Sir Edward Feathers, reflecting on his life. His nickname provided the book with its title, which Ms. Gardam explained on the opening page, in which a group of jurists in London discuss a mysterious departing figure (Feathers). One man wonders who he was. “It was Old Filth,” a judge replies. “Great advocate, judge and — bit of a wit. Said to have invented FILTH — Failed in London Try Hong Kong. He tried Hong Kong.”Wry yet tender, with reflections on the British Raj and cameos from historical figures including Queen Mary, whom Feathers befriends during World War II, the book was included on the BBC’s 2015 list of the 100 greatest British novels. And while Ms. Gardam said she never intended to write a sequel, believing that an author should get it all out in a single volume, “Old Filth” spawned two companion novels: “The Man in the Wooden Hat” (2009), which filled in details about Feathers’s wife, Betty, who spent part of her childhood in a Japanese internment camp; and “Last Friends” (2013), which focused on his archrival and Betty’s sometime lover, Terry Veneering.Evoking the privileged life that Betty was born into before the war, Ms. Gardam wrote of “the tea tray with cups and silver spoons, the little grey butterfly cakes, the cigarette cases and cigar lighters and dried grasses in china vases.” In another passage, Ms. Gardam took readers inside Betty’s psyche, describing how she was “amazed as she never ceased to be, about how such a multitude of ideas and images exist alongside one another and how the brain can cope with them, layered like filo pastry in the mind, invisible as data behind the screen.”“The writing crackles with energy, variety, sensuous richness,” novelist Maggie Gee said of “Old Filth,” according to the Guardian. “It is the writing of a 25-year-old with the wisdom and subtlety of a razor-sharp 100-year-old.”In fact, Ms. Gardam was 76 when the novel was published. And with the success of “Old Filth,” she gained new recognition — she was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2009 — and a new audience in the United States, where many of her earlier novels were given a wide release for the first time.Those books included “God on the Rocks” (1978), which had been shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Set on the English coast in 1936, it was told through the eyes of Margaret Marsh, an 8-year-old living in a strict religious home.“It would be better without people,” Margaret tells her mother, wishing that her newborn brother had never come into the family. Gently chided by her mother, she adds, “If I’d been God I’d have left it at dinosaurs.”Jean Mary Pearson — she later changed her given name to Jane — was born in Coatham, part of the seaside town of Redcar, on July 11, 1928. Holidays were spent at her grandfather’s farm in Cumberland, which served as the setting for much of her fiction.Her father was a boarding school math teacher. Her mother, a prolific letter writer with literary aspirations, read aloud from Beatrix Potter books, encouraging her daughter’s interest in writing.Ms. Gardam said her parents looked down on her as a child, believing she was “rather thick” because she struggled with math. She wrote her first stories in secret, storing them in her bedroom chimney; they went up in flames one day after she got chicken pox, when a fire was started to keep her warm. At age 6, she was the victim of another accident when she got too close to the fireplace and burned her hands “to the bone.”After the end of World War II, Ms. Gardam earned a scholarship to study English at Bedford College, part of the University of London. “There was no coal in England, and there was very little food, but it was extraordinary,” she told the New Yorker in 2014, looking back on that period. “I couldn’t get over the fact that we’d won, I was so sure we’d be overrun by Germans, that it seemed to me romantically wonderful that we were alive.”She received a bachelor’s degree in 1949 and pursued a PhD, only to drop out when her grant ended and she needed to find work. For a time, she was a proofreader at Weldon’s Ladies’ Journal, only to be fired because she “couldn’t take the articles on flower arranging seriously enough.” She was also a traveling librarian, dispatched to military hospitals on behalf of the Red Cross, and a deputy editor for the literary magazine Time and Tide. Years later, she wrote book reviews for the Spectator and Telegraph.In 1954, she married David Gardam, a barrister who worked on construction cases overseas, providing some of the inspiration for “Old Filth.” They started a family in Wimbledon, in southwest London. After their youngest was old enough to go to school, Ms. Gardam began working on her first book, the children’s story collection “A Few Fair Days.”“I think I would have died if it hadn’t been published,” she told the Guardian in 2011. “I was desperate to get started — I was possessed.”The book came out in 1971, the same year she published “A Long Way From Verona,” a novel for slightly older readers. Set in wartime England, it was written from the perspective of Jessica Vye, a self-assured 13-year-old who dreams of becoming a writer and has “a lovely summer holiday in spite of the air-raids and Dunkirk and everything.”Ms. Gardam’s first book for adults, the Jamaica-set story collection “Black Faces, White Faces,” was published in 1975. Her later books included the 1985 novel “Crusoe’s Daughter,” about an orphaned child who finds solace in the work of Daniel Defoe. Ms. Gardam considered it her best book.Her husband, who took up painting and printmaking in addition to practicing law, died in 2010. The next year, her daughter Catharine “Kitty” Nicholson, an acclaimed botanical artist, died of breast cancer.Survivors include two sons, Tim and Thomas Gardam; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.Ms. Gardam told the Paris Review that as her husband’s and daughter’s health declined, she threw herself into working on her “Old Filth” trilogy. Its concluding volume, the last novel she ever published, opened with a funeral.“Really, writing it was my salvation,” she said of “The Man in the Wooden Hat.” “To survive you turn to what you can do, I suppose.”",
