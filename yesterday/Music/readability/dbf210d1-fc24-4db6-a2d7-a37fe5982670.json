  "text": "Porcupine Tree unexpectedly came back in 2022 with a new record Closure/Continuation (plus a live album called Closure/Continuation.Live), and played a bunch of shows in support of the record throughout 2022 and 2023. Porcupine Tree frontman Steven Wilson has since gone back to focusing on his solo work, though he does firmly believe there will be a follow-up to Closure/Continuation. In an interview with Innerviews, Wilson responded to a question about new music and the future of the band saying: \"It's a bit too early to say, to be honest. Again, they're different. I think a bit like my solo career, Porcupine Tree has reached a point where we don't want to try to do anything except be ourselves. We don't want to worry about what people expect of us—not that we ever did. \"We're enjoying the process. I love working with Gavin Harrison and Richard Barbieri. And the obvious thing for me now is that because the solo career is established, I'm much more able to be part of a democratic band in a way I wasn't back in the day. I used to feel the need to control it more. Now, I don't. In fact, I relish the idea of giving up control and perhaps not getting my own way all the time. I'm open to not necessarily doing things the way I would have done them myself. \"I think Porcupine Tree going forward won't be incredibly prolific. We may not tour again. But I think we'll definitely make at least one more record. It could even be the next project, possibly. But that's as much as I can say at the moment.\" He also noted that he'd love to do a Porcupine Tree live show box set, though that might prove difficult as he's got a lot of material to dig through. \"I've been talking about doing a Porcupine Tree live box set, because pretty much every show we played was recorded. But that would be a massive job to compile 12-15 shows that represent each phase of the band in the best possible light. It would be three-to-four months' work. When am I going to do that? I think it's something I will get to eventually, but it would be at a time when I take a step back from making new work. And as you see, that isn't happening right now.\" Want More Metal?
