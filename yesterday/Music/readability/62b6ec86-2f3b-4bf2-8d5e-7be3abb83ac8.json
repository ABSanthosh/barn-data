  "text": "Jelly Roll shares his thoughts on the Eminem vs MGK feud, and why he believes he can bring the two artists together. Keep watching to learn more! Jelly Roll: My heart is always to bring them together one day because I see so much more of them in each other than they know, you know what I mean? Tetris Kelly: Could the Eminem and Machine Gun Kelly feud come to an end? Jelly Roll thinks he can do it. We have the story. Jelly Roll: I hadn’t really brought it up to Marshall yet because I’m still just kind of glad that I’m still in that circumstance to be able to have those conversations. But I do see so much more in them than not. Tetris Kelly: Em and MGK have exchanged bars and jabs against each other for some time. Jelly has collaborated with both rappers on his project and he told the Flagrant Podcast he’s up for bringing the peace. Jelly Roll: Like I also gave Kel some perspective, too. And it’s like we all grew up watching Eminem take over the game early. If you were mentioned in an Eminem song, it was like getting mentioned in a comedy special. You were on fire. You couldn’t be hotter. Tetris Kelly: Em and MGK first started butting heads in 2012, when the latter — who was 22 at the time — referred to the former’s then-16-year-old daughter Hailie as “hot as f–k” on Twitter. Look man, they’re going to get together one day, eventually. It’s inevitable, the world’s a circle, you know what I mean? And I think they’re going to find each other’s heart more than they don’t. And if they never do connect that way I think that it did more for both of them than it did to hurt them.",
