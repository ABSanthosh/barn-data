  "text": "Hatebreed recently announced that founding bassist Chris Beattie would be filled in for by Shadows Fall guitarist Matt Bachand \"for the foreseeable future.\" Which of course left everyone to wonder what was going on with Beattie. According to a brand new statement from Beattie, he left Hatebreed on November 13, 2024 and clarifies that \"the decision to leave the band was not mine and that my departure was uncalled for and based on misleading and wrongful statements that will be subject to future actions.\" So clearly there's something going on behind the scenes that caused a rift between Hatebreed and Beattie, but it's not clear what that issue might be. It's also obvious that Beattie doesn't agree with whatever was being. Hatebreed has not offered further comment on this situation just yet. \"I just want to take the time to let everyone know that I am doing just fine and I sincerely appreciate everyone who has reached out,\" wrote Beattie in his statement. \"I was under the impression a joint announcement would be agreed upon in advance, but since that was not the case I wanted to address your concerns in my own post. At this time I am unable to discuss the specifics surrounding my departure from Hatebreed on November 13, 2024. However, I want to clarify that the decision to leave the band was not mine and that my departure was uncalled for and based on misleading and wrongful statements that will be subject to future actions.\" Want More Metal?
