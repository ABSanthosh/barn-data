  "text": "After headlining Coachella and a series of special shows in Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, and Singapore, Lady Gaga will embark on a 2025 tour. Titled the “Mayhem Ball,” the arena outing will see the Mother Monster returning to arenas in North America and Europe throughout the summer and fall. Get Lady Gaga Tickets Here Get tickets here, and read on for more details on about Lady Gaga’s “The Mayhem Ball,” including details on pre-sale tickets and more. Lady Gaga’s 2025 “The Mayhem Ball” will hit arenas throughout the US, with a dip into Canada and a number of shows in Europe and the UK. The focus of the tour will be music from her recently released seventh album, Mayhem. “I wasn’t planning to tour this year after my shows in Singapore but the incredible response to the new album inspired me to keep things going,” the artist shared via social media. “We chose arenas this time to give me the opportunity to control the details of the show in a way you simply can’t in stadiums — and honestly, I can’t wait. This show is designed to be the kind of theatrical and electrifying experience that brings Mayhem to life exactly how I envision it.” The trek kicks off with two nights in Las Vegas. Then, Gaga will make her way to Seattle, New York, Miami, Toronto, and Chicago, with multiple shows in each city. September takes her across the pond to multiple shows throughout the UK, followed by two more months of shows throughout Europe. The current layout sees her wrapping the tour in November with three nights in Paris. How Can I Get Lady Gaga’s “Mayhem Ball” Tickets? Those interested in attending the “Mayhem Ball” should start by signing up for a pre-sale through Lady Gaga’s Ticketmaster profile, which prompts users to select a specific show to target. This will unlock access to an artist pre-sale scheduled for Wednesday, April 2nd at 12:00 p.m. local time. Additional pre-sales for Citi Cardmembers and Verizon Access subscribers will take place on March 31st and April 1st, respectively,  also on Ticketmaster. Tickets are set to go on sale to the general public on Thursday, April 3rd at 12:00 p.m. local time via Ticketmaster.

All of the packages include a dedicated check-in area, a collectible laminate, and a concierge team, with various add-ons available across the different tiers.
