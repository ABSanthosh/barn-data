  "text": "The Haunted is back with their first new record in eight years Songs Of Last Resort due out May 30, and a new single \"Warhead\" streaming right now. If you're a fan of old-school The Haunted, I'm almost positive you're going to love this. It's fast, it's furious, it's melodic as hell, and I love it! The Haunted vocalist Marco Aro commented: \"This is the first single of our new album 'Songs of Last Resort'. The song is called 'Warhead' and it's an aggressive statement about the absolute horrors of the world we now have to live in!” The Haunted guitarist Patrik Jensen added: \"When writing this song, I knew that we were on to writing a good album. The main riff came to me at work, and I had to take the afternoon off that day to immediately get it recorded and worked on while the inspiration from this one riff was still creating goosebumps. Lyrics are about various people in charge being 'war heads', thriving in one way or another off of waging war. \"The intro sound fx were created together with Örjan Örnkloo (ex-Misery Loves Company, who also performs on 'To Bleed Out' and the title track 'Letters of Last Resort'). I think it's not a stretch to say that this song stand a real chance of becoming a fixture of our live set for many years to come…\" Pre-orders for Songs Of Last Resort are available here.
