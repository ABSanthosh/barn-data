  "text": "System of a Down drummer John Dolmayan says he’s “glad” Donald Trump is back in the White House, even going so far as to say that his presidency “brings a little sanity back” to the United States. It’s no secret that Dolmayan is a Trump supporter, although he wasn’t as vocal about Trump’s second run for president as he was back in 2016 or during his first term. The drummer used to flood his Instagram page with right-wing beliefs, much to the chagrin of his liberal bandmate Serj Tankian, but has largely avoided politics on his social pages the past couple years. Get System of a Down Tickets Here Now, in a new interview with Australian YouTube personality Lilian Tahmasian (as transcribed by Blabbermouth), Dolmayan has opened up once again about his support for Trump, and the complex nature of the differing political beliefs between System of a Down members. Dolmayan confirmed that he voted for Trump in the 2024 election, declaring, “I’m glad he won, because it brings a little sanity back. Irrespective of what you hear out there, it’s much more sane with him than it was without him. We need law and order. Just like you lock your door at night, you don’t want somebody coming to your house when you have secure borders.” He continued, “We need people coming to this country. We all came to this country. And we need more people coming in. And the United States should always be a bastion for people that need it. Maybe they get oppression one way or the other in their countries and they need to leave. Or maybe they just want a fresh start. Or maybe they wanna be part of something that’s unique and interesting like the United States. And they should be allowed to do that, but do it a certain way — pay taxes, whatever you need to do, and live your life.”",
