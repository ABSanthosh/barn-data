The beloved hard rock band has a brand new album, From Zero, released on Friday (November 15th), and they’ve now charted out an extensive world tour for 2025. Dubbed the “From Zero World Tour,” the outing includes the band’s first comprehensive North American run in a decade. Linkin Park’s 2025 world tour kicks off on January 31st in Mexico City and, after a brief break, then makes its way to the United States in April. The band will hit cities like New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and more, while also stopping at high profile festivals like Sick New World, Sonic Temple, and Welcome to Rockville. Get Linkin Park Tickets Here Get tickets here, and scroll more details about how to get access to one of the most anticipated upcoming tours in hard rock. What Is Linkin Park’s “From Zero” World Tour? Linkin Park’s “From Zero World Tour” serves as both the band’s first significant outing since the passing of frontman Chester Bennington and as support for their new comeback record of the same name. The band previewed the tour with a handful of shows in select cities this past fall. Read our review and see photos of their concert at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California, here. “Getting back out on the road has been incredible,” Mike Shinoda shared in a statement. “The fans’ support is overwhelming, and we’re ready to take this energy even further around the world. From Zero is a new chapter for us, and we’re so excited to share it with everyone on a bigger scale.” How Can I Get Tickets to Linkin Park’s 2025 Tour? Tickets to Linkin Park’s 2025 tour are now on sale. Fans can look for deals or get tickets to sold-out shows via StubHub, where orders are 100% guaranteed through StubHub’s FanProtect program. Who Is Singing for Linkin Park’s 2025 Tour? Linkin Park has brought in Dead Sea frontwoman Emily Armstrong as their new lead vocalist. In addition to showcasing her addition on stage, From Zero singles like “The Emptiness Machine” and “Heavy Is the Crown” teased her studio work with the band. Following the announcement of Armstrong’s involvement, some fans took issue with her relationship with Danny Masterson and the Church of Scientology. She has since addressed the scrutiny, saying, “I always try to see the good in people, and I misjudged him. I have never spoken with him since. Unimaginable details emerged and he was later found guilty.” “To say it as clearly as possible: I do not condone abuse or violence against women, and I empathize with the victims of these crimes,” she added. In addition to Armstrong, classic Linkin Park members Mike Shinoda, Joe Hahn, and Dave “Phoenix” Farrell will join the band for the jaunt, as well as touring members Colin Brittain and Alex Feder. Guitarist Brad Delson recorded the new album with the band, but opted out of the tour. Who Is Opening for Linkin Park’s 2025 Tour? The band will be sharing the stage with an eclectic group of artists across the “From Zero” tour, including classic punk acts, up-and-comers, and rappers. Support comes by way of Queens of the Stone Age, Spiritbox, AFI, Architects, grandson, Jean Dawson, JPEGMAFIA, and PVRIS on select dates. See who is set to open for Linkin Park on each date below.
