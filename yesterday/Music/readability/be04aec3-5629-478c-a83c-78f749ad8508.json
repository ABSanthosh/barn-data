  "text": "Stevie Nicks has added eight new shows to her 2025 North American tour. The new concerts take place in and around Nicks’ previously-announced US and Canada shows in August, early September, and October. The new events are also intended to make up for Nicks’ cancelled shows with Billy Joel after Joel was diagnosed with a brain disorder earlier this year. Get Stevie Nicks Tickets Here Nicks will now open the tour in Brooklyn on August 8th and add cities like Detroit, Portland, Sacramento, Atlantic City, Charlotte, and more to her itinerary. The run will now conclude on October 25th in Hartford, Connecticut. Tickets are now on sale via Ticketmaster. See Nicks’ updated tour routing below. Fans can look for tickets to her previously announced concerts here. Nicks recently revealed that she’s hard at work on her first new album in 14 years, which she began in the wake of the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles this year. “I have seven songs, and they are autobiographical, real stories where I’m not pulling any punches for probably the first time in my life,” she said back in April. “They are not airy-fairy songs that you are wondering who they’re about but you don’t really get it. They’re real stories of memories of mine, of fantastic men.” Stevie Nicks 2025 Tour Dates (new dates in bold): 08/08 — Brooklyn, NY @ Barclays Center 08/12 — Boston, MA @ TD Garden 08/15 — Toronto, ON @ Scotiabank Arena 08/19 — Saint Paul, MN @ Xcel Energy Center 08/23 — Cincinnati, OH @ Heritage Bank Center 08/27 — Columbia, SC @ Colonial Life Arena 08/30 — Tampa, FL @ Amalie Arena 09/03 — Hollywood, FL @ Hard Rock Live  09/07 — Detroit, MI @ Little Caesars Arena 10/01 — Portland, OR @ MODA Center 10/04 — Sacramento, CA @ Golden 1 Center 10/07 — Phoenix, AZ @ PHX Arena 10/11 — Las Vegas, NV @ T-Mobile Arena 10/15 — Oklahoma City, OK @ Paycom Center 10/18 — Atlantic City, NJ @ Boardwalk Hall  10/21 — Charlotte, NC @ Spectrum Center  10/25 — Hartford, CT @ PeoplesBank Arena",
