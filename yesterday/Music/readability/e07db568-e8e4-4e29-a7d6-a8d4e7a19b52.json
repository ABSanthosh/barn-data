  "text": "Lewis Capaldi made a surprise return to the Glastonbury stage on Friday, June 27th, two years after cutting his festival performance short due to struggles from Tourette’s syndrome. Kicking off his seven-song set with “Before You Go,” Capaldi went on to debut his newly released song, “Survive.” The Scottish singer-songwriter also played other hits like “Hold Me While You Wait” and “Forget Me” before fittingly closing out the performance with a rendition of his international smash “Someone You Loved.” “I couldn’t sing this song two years ago,” he said through tears, before launching into the 2018 hit. “I might struggle to finish it today for different reasons. My name is Lewis Capaldi and I’m fucking back baby.” Back in 2023, Capaldi needed help from fans to finish getting through “Someone You Loved.” This time, he would have been able to crush it all on his own, but they joined in anyway. Watch the emotional performance below. Capaldi has only performed a handful of times since Glastonbury 2023. Shortly after that performance, he announced he was taking an indefinite hiatus from touring to better “adjust to the impact of my Tourette’s.” While on stage at Glastonbury 2025, Capaldi shared gratitude for his return. “It’s just amazing to be here with you all, and I can’t thank you all enough for coming out and coming and seeing me,” he told the crowd. “Second time’s a charm on this one, everybody.” He added, “I just wanted to come and finish what I couldn’t finish the first time around on this stage. I want to thank everybody at Glastonbury for giving me the chance to do so.” “Survive” marks Capaldi’s first new music since January 2024, when he released an expanded edition of his sophomore album, Broken by Desire to Be Heavenly Sent. Glastonbury it’s so incredible to be back, thank you so much for having me x pic.twitter.com/32n6S99fCw — Lewis Capaldi (@LewisCapaldi) June 27, 2025",
