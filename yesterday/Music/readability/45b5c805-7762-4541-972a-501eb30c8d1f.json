I’m Sergio George, and we’re going ‘Behind the Photo’ with Billboard.Photo number one, this photo, I believe, was in Premios Juventud with Marc and Luis Figueroa. They sang the song “Flor Pálida.” So it was vocals and piano. It was a magical moment, because I had to actually play piano for real, live. Pretty scary. Photo number two, oh, this was, I think, in Sony Studios, Sony Music Studios. I was recording, well I was recording vocals with Noriel, part of my salsa urban record with Noriel at Sony Studios. Cool picture. The story behind this picture. This was a master class that I had in Panama, Panama City, Panama. I had two full houses of 350 people each day. And this was a magical moment that people actually showed up to hear me talk crap. This is the photo that we’ve seen looks like he’s seven feet tall compared to me. It was, uh, we were recording the video for “La Vida Es Una Fiesta” and he’s not that much taller than me, by the way, but we sing as a man, I love it.",
