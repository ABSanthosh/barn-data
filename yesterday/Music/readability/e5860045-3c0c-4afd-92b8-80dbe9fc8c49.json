Keep watching for this in-depth and vulnerable conversation with Nicky Jam.  What was your favorite part of the interview? Let us know in the comments below! Nicky Jam: I would love to tell you that Trump story.  Leila Cobo: Tell me the story. Well I haven’t told anyone.  Tell me! I’m going to take advantage and tell you about it.  Nicky, you came to La Industria hungry. If they come to La Industria, you have to try these cheese arepas and cream.  And how involved are you in preparing the dishes on the menu? In almost everything. I mean, my DNA is all over the menu. Ok, then wait, because I have the menu here.  Oh, no wait. You just touched it and it moved a little. The man- Here comes the most handsome man in the world. So here is the most handsome man in the world. And how are you? Oh, what a delight. Thank you! Server: With pleasure.  So, these are the famous arepas with “queso de mano.” “Queso de mano” is the one that is shredded inside? No. The reverse? Yes, the soft one over there, try it! Take a little bite, it’s fine. You’re going to stick a fork in an arepa? Yeah… D*amn! You know that I’m a real thug.  Let’s see, but is this a Colombian or Venezuelan arepa? But you are a lady. This is a Venezuelan arepa.  You clearly know that it is not Colombian. Keep watching for more!",
