  "text": "After reuniting for the first time in nearly a decade last year, No Doubt will come together once again for a performance at next week’s FireAid Benefit Concert. The concert was first announced earlier this week in the wake of the devastating fires in Los Angeles, with Gwen Stefani as one of the many A-list artists set to perform. Today, though, we’ve learned that her booking will actually be a full-fledged No Doubt performance, with her bandmates Tony Kanal, Tom Dumont, Adrian Young set to join her. This will mark No Doubt’s first appearance since their headlining performance at Coachella 2024, which ended up being a “Skachella” of sorts thanks to their involvement, plus the reunion of fellow SoCal band, Sublime. FireAid will be held on January 30th at both the Intuit Dome and the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California. Joining No Doubt on the lineup will be Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Green Day, Stevie Nicks, Joni Mitchell, Jelly Roll, P!NK, Sting, Stephen Stills, John Mayer, Dave Matthews, Earth, Wind, \u0026 Fire, Lil Baby, Gracie Abrams, Tate McRae, Green Day, Katy Perry, Rod Stewart, and more. Tickets for FireAid will go on sale on Wednesday, January 22nd at 12:00 p.m. PT (3:00 p.m. ET) via Ticketmaster. For more information — on the show, donations, and more — check out the concert’s website. For those who can’t attend in person, FireAid will be streamed on Apple TV, Max, Netflix, Paramount+, Prime Video, YouTube, and the Amazon Music Channel on Twitch, among other places.",
