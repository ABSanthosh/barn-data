  "text": "The Cure’s first new album in 16 years, Songs of a Lost World, drops tomorrow (Friday, November 1st). To add the already incredibly high level of anticipation, the beloved goth band performed two intimate in-studio sessions for BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 6. Even better, both sets are available on-demand via BBC’s iPlayer. The band recorded both performances on Wednesday, October 30th in front of a small crowd of lucky fans. The sets notably serve as The Cure’s first live performances in support of Songs of a Lost World, with the band performing cuts from the album as well as classics from their wider discography. See both setlists below. Both sets, as well as the accompanying interviews with frontman Robert Smith, are available for fans to stream via the BBC iPlayer for 30 days. Stream The Cure’s BBC Radio 6 Music Session here, and stream The Cure’s BBC Radio 2 In Concert here. The Cure will next take the stage at Troxy in London on Friday, November 1st for a proper full-length concert that will be streamed live on YouTube. While it’s exciting to have new The Cure on the horizon, Smith recently revealed that the band is slowly gearing up for retirement. Following the release of Songs of a Lost World, he promised the act would play “quite regularly” through the 50th anniversary of their debut album, at which point they’d hang up their black capes and wipe off their white face paint. Prior to Songs of a Lost World (for which vinyl and CD pre-orders are ongoing), The Cure’s most recent album was 2008’s 4:13 Dream.
