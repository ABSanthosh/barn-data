  "text": "A Perfect Circle celebrated their 25th anniversary this year, and in those two plus decades, they've released four studio records, three live albums, and amassed nearly 1B streams on Spotify alone. There's plenty to celebrate – including the possibility of new A Perfect Circle material. The supergroup, consisting of Maynard James Keenan (TOOL), Billy Howerdel, Josh Freese (Guns N' Roses, Foo Fighters), James Iha (Smashing Pumpkins), and Matt McJunkins (Eagles Of Death Metal), haven't released a new record since 2018. Seven years pales in comparison to the 14 years between their 2004 release, eMOTIVe, and the aforementioned 2018 release, Eat the Elephant, and fans may not have to wait that long. When talking to Revolver, Howerdel explained that he is working on new music that will hopefully evolve into new A Perfect Circle material: \"As I'm writing, sometimes I find myself [thinking], Wow, I really like this, but man, this is fucking sinister. I'm in a not-sleeping-much and self-discovery mode. When I'm writing music, I've been full night-terror, waking up – like, can't let your mind rest thing.\" And Howerdel isn't the only one, \"I'm always writing. I'm writing with everyone,\" Keenan added. So, with new music potentially taking shape as new A Perfect Circle album, there is plenty to be happy about during their 25th anniversary. Want More Metal?
