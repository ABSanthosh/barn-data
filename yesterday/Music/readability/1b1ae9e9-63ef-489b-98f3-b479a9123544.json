  "text": "Rick Astley’s No. 1 hit “Never Gonna Give You Up” has rickrolled its way past 1 billion Spotify streams, nearly four decades after its original release. “I never could have imagined back in 1987 that ‘Never Gonna Give You Up’ would still be going strong decades later,” the English singer said in a statement. “Thanks to streaming platforms, a whole new generation has been able to discover music like mine. Reaching 1 billion streams is something I never dreamed of and to everyone who’s ever listened, thank you.” Following its initial release, “Never Gonna Give You Up” went No. 1 in more than 25 countries. Two decades later, it found a resurgence through an internet meme known as “rickrolling,” which tricks users into clicking a link that redirects them to the song’s music video. Revisit Astley’s 2022 appearance on The Story Behind the Song podcast, where he discusses how “Never Gonna Give You Up” made him an internet and pop culture phenomenon.",
