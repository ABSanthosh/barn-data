  "text": "Chiodos stopped their March 23 show at The Fillmore in Minneapolis, MN after about three songs due to vocalist Craig Owens fighting off some kind of illness. After the show, Chiodos issued the following statement: \"Minnesota —we are very sorry for the set being cut early tonight. \"Shortly before tonight's performance was about to begin, Craig became quite ill. With the intention of doing his best to proceed on with the show, it soon became apparent that this was not possible. \"We are currently sorting out a rescheduled date with the promoters, with all previously purchased tickets to be honored. We will also work out a refund plan for those that are unable to attend the new date. This resolution will happen very soon and you will be updated momentarily—we appreciate your patience in the meantime. \"Again, we are truly upset and sorry to have this happen, and we will make it up to you—in the meantime please extend your good vibes to Craig to get better soon. At this time all other scheduled shows will continue as planned.\" It seems that things haven't gotten much better, as Chiodos has now rescheduled a handful of dates. Tonight's appearance at The Fillmore in Denver, CO is now set for May 4, the March 26 at The Depot in Salt Lake City, UT for May 5, and the Minnesota show will happen again on May 1. However! The show tonight in Colorado will still go on with openers Hawthorne Heights, Emmure, and The Callous Daoboys.
