  "text": "Theresa Wolters steps in as interim executive director, Billboard has learned. Laura Segura, MusiCares executive director, attends the 67th GRAMMY Awards on Feb. 2, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Laura Segura, executive director of MusiCares, has departed the organization after five years as executive director, according to an email sent to staff by Harvey Mason Jr., CEO of the Recording Academy and MusiCares. The memo announced a “key leadership transition” heading into Memorial Day weekend, revealing that Segura is “no longer with MusiCares” — and that Theresa Wolters, who’s been serving as MusiCares’ head of health and human services, “is stepping into the role of interim executive director.” No reason or details regarding Segura’s departure were given. Billboard reached out to the Recording Academy and MusiCares on Saturday (May 24) for comment. Trending on Billboard The leadership and staff directory on MusiCares’ website no longer includes Segura’s name and lists Wolters as interim executive director. Segura was named executive director at MusiCares in 2020, after serving as vp of membership and industry relations at the Recording Academy. She was honored at Billboard‘s Women in Music, which recognizes top executives in the industry, in both 2022 and 2023. Segura and Wolters, who is now MusiCares’ interim executive director, co-penned a guest column for Billboard, “Health Insurance Isn’t Enough — Music Also Needs a Financial Safety Net,” published in March. MusiCares, founded by the Recording Academy in 1989, provides a safety net of critical health and welfare services to the music community. The U.S. based, independent 501(c)(3) charity offers financial grant programs, support resources and crisis relief. Earlier this month, MusiCares reported that nearly $10 million raised for Los Angeles wildfire relief efforts during the 2025 Grammy Awards was distributed to recipients across the region. As of May 2, $6,125,000 was disbursed to more than 3,100 music professionals across L.A, and $3,969,005 had been directed to the community-based organizations California Community Foundation, Direct Relief and Pasadena Community Foundation. An additional $16 million was raised by MusiCares and the Recording Academy during Grammy weekend with the MusiCares Fire Relief campaign and its annual Persons of the Year gala. $6 million of that amount was allocated to longterm fire relief efforts, and $10 million will go toward the organization’s year-round mission delivery. “What moved us most in the days following the Grammy telecast wasn’t just the scale of support, it was the spirit behind it, Segura said in a statement on May 2. “Thousands of people gave what they could, and together, their generosity became a lifeline for those in crisis, which reached far beyond our industry. That’s why we partnered with trusted community organizations who are helping Angelenos across the region access the care, resources and support they need to rebuild.” Daily newsletters straight to your inbox Sign Up More From Pro",
