  "text": "I swear there has to be something in the air – between drummers getting fired, rehired, and then fired again, and making Instagram posts listing the possible reasons they could have been laid off – a lot of bands are going through a major structural change. And the German band The Ocean is no different. First, they announced the departure of Paul Seidel, their drummer (fitting) in February, Ramis Ahfeldt, their guitarist was next and left earlier this month, with the vocalist Loïc Rossetti now following in their footsteps. Taking to Instagram yesterday, Rossetti announced that he was leaving the band and wished them all the best. After almost 20 years as the band's frontman, he said the decision was his and that he no longer creatively aligns with the band, which makes sense given the amount of time he spent in The Ocean. He wished the group all the best, thanked everyone for their support, and let people know he is already working on his next project. You can check out the full statement below. \"What a wild ride these 16 years have been! As you might’ve heard, I’m stepping down as vocalist of The Ocean and @hellfestopenair will be my final show with the band. To everyone who’s been there from sweaty basement gigs to festivals, your support kept this fire burning. Some of you became real friends along the way. Never saw that coming. Thank you. This decision is mine. Over time, our visions and creative paths naturally drifted. Without diving too deep into it, I’ve realized I’m no longer meant to be part of this particular dynamic. No drama, just heading in different directions. The Ocean will carry on, and I wish them well. I’m proud of what we built. Big thanks to Robin, my bandmates, every crew member, my wife and family and everyone who helped make this journey possible. As for me, I’m diving into something new and bringing all this energy with me. I’m stoked for whatever madness comes next. Horns up, you beautiful lunatics. Thanks for making all this chaos worth it. Keep backing the bands you dig and stay safe out there. Peace\" Want More Metal?
