  "text": "What if you could dance all night, connect deeply with others and wake up feeling better than ever? A new wave of wellness-focused dance parties is proving you can. As the electronic dance music scene continues to be stereotyped by wild raves and an inextricable link to substance use, more artists now shifting their focus toward wellness. While some major DJs like Kaskade, ILLENIUM and Chris Lake have chosen a sober lifestyle, others are incorporating wellness practices to find balance. Chart-topping dance music acts like RÜFÜS DU SOL, Diplo, Felix Jaehn and Steve Aoki consistently incorporate wellness routines that prioritize their mental and physical health to avoid burnout.This cultural shift is becoming more prevalent within the fan community as well. Wellness-focused dance collectives are emerging and providing alcohol-free, high-energy spaces where people can connect on a deeper level.With the theme of connection at their bedrock, these collectives curate alcohol-free spaces at the intersection of dance music and mindfulness. We spoke with three, Daybreaker, Superbloom and The Oracle Project, who are at the forefront of this movement.A new kind of partyDaybreaker, a pioneer in the wellness rave scene, hosts morning dance parties that begin with yoga and flow into high-energy dancing before concluding with meditation. Similarly, Superbloom promotes community through free- and donation-based classes in parks and beaches, blending lively house music with a focus on wellness.The team behind The Oracle Project, a more recent group, curates reflective experiences that incorporate mindfulness practices followed by music and dancing. Organizers also provide conversation cards to foster meaningful interactions.The shift from partying to wellnessMost of the individuals behind these collectives have personal stories driving them to innovate the movement. Lauren Brenc, founder of The Oracle Project, says her own experiences in nightlife shaped her decision to move away from alcohol. Having once worked as a bartender, she eventually realized she could no longer sustain that lifestyle.\"There was a part of me that didn’t want to give up the fun and excitement of going out,\" Brenc explains. \"But I didn’t want it to revolve around something that was making me sick and wasn’t fueling deep connection.\" Andre Herd of Daybreaker also saw a disconnect between his own values and the traditional nightlife scene in which he worked. As someone who has managed artists and worked in the music industry, Herd had seen how prevalent alcohol was at events. When he began working at Daybreaker in his early 20s, the role was a revelation.\"When I was younger, I used to go out a lot and found myself drinking at every party or social event, just to feel like I could have a good time,\" recalls Herd, who said he eventually started working with Daybreaker and gave up alcohol altogether. \"It was so aligned with who I am at my core. It gave me the space to let loose without needing alcohol. In 2014, there weren’t many events like it, and Daybreaker really started a trend.\"Courtney Miller and Brandon Darnell, co-founders of Superbloom, were deeply immersed in wellness long before launching their collective. The former, a lifelong athlete, found synergy with the latter's love of house music, and together they co-founded Superbloom to share their passion for health and music with their communities.A deeper fulfillmentWhat makes these events stand out is the deeper sense of fulfillment they offer. For Superbloom, the focus is on creating spaces where people can cultivate relationships—both with themselves and others—in \"vibrant dancefloors and areas where people can get comfortable and sit down and relax,\" according to Darnell.\"It creates this really conducive environment for self-expression and for authentic and deep connection,\" she says.At The Oracle Project’s events, Brenc sees attendees making profound, lasting bonds.\"I hear so many stories of people falling in love, starting businesses together, or becoming close friends very quickly,\" she says. \"The connections formed are so genuine.\"Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesHerd agrees, noting that the absence of alcohol paves the way for a more satisfying life free from the hangovers, anxiety and malaise that often follow a night of drinking, leaving you feeling energized and clear-minded instead.\"Some of the wildest parties I’ve been to were Daybreaker events,\" he gushes. \"When people are in a space where they feel no pressure to drink or act a certain way, they can truly let loose. Unlike traditional parties where substances are used to relax, Daybreaker proves that people can reach the same high naturally.\"Mindfulness and intention-settingThe crux of these collectives and their events is mindfulness. Brenc incorporates cacao circles before dancing to help set the tone at The Oracle Project’s events.\"When we sit in a circle to set our intentions, it creates a sacred moment,\" she explains. \"It allows everyone to connect with themselves and each other before we let loose on the dancefloor.\"Daybreaker also incorporates mindfulness as a key element of its events, beginning with yoga and ending with moments of reflection and joy. Herd says the infrastructure of the organization's events places \"huggers\" at the door to greet guests with a hug and set a joyful tone.Superbloom takes a similar approach, blending music and movement into a cohesive experience with intention.\"Setting an intention is like sharing a dream,\" says Miller. \"It opens up the space, removes barriers, and allows people to come together more deeply from the start.\" Darnell adds that \"it's a way for everyone to feel seen and heard right from the start, and from there, people just naturally open up, and the entire event becomes more immersive and meaningful.\"Pushing past discomfortDespite the growing popularity of wellness-focused dance parties, some are still hesitant to step outside their comfort zone and try something new. But Herd, Brenc and the co-founders of Superbloom all agree that the experience is worth it. Darnell of Superbloom emphasized how sober dance parties can be likened to fitness for authentic expression. In a similar way, alcohol-free dance parties can feel intimidating at first, just like stepping into a gym.\"It might be intimidating or scary to go into the space and it might take a little while to settle in, but once you do, what you get is a stronger, more authentic expression of yourself,\" Darnell explains. That approach, he says, has enabled him to speak confidently in front of large crowds, dance without inhibition and have fun without the next-day regrets.Herd also paints a picture of Daybreaker's events as welcoming, low-pressure spaces. \"There’s no expectation to dance or act a certain way. You can just enjoy the vibe, sip coffee, or let loose on the dance floor without any pressure,\" he said.Brenc encouraged anyone who is hesitant to attend to think of it like any other time they’ve pushed past discomfort in life.\"Think of the times in your life where you stepped out of your comfort zone—it’s always worth it,\" she said. \"These events are safe places where you’ll meet wonderful people.\"The future of wellness danceWhether you're dancing at Daybreaker’s sunrise yoga parties, connecting through mindfulness at Superbloom’s wellness events or finding deep conversations at The Oracle Project, there's no question the wellness-focused dance scene could reshape the collective perspective of fun.As these parties gain popularity in lockstep with the booming \"sober curious\" movement, it’s clear the future of nightlife is about more than drinking less. It's about living authentically and fully in the moment.",
