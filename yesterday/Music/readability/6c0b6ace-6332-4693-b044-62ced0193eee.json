  "text": "Dame Helen Mirren recently spoke about losing people still experiencing their youth as part of a wide-ranging conversation about the experience of aging in public life. While appearing on the Brave New World podcast, the 79-year-old actress mentioned Kurt Cobain as a particularly tragic example. “This is what 79 is, you know. And it’s kind of okay. It’s not brilliant,” Mirren said. “But it wasn’t that brilliant to be 25 either, so it’s not a question of seeking youth at all. It’s a question of living the life you have as fully and positively and enjoyably and confusingly and everything that it was when you were younger.” The 1923 star emphasized that she feels “lucky” to have reached her current age. “I always say it’s so sad that Kurt Cobain died when he did because he never saw GPS, as it’s the most wonderful thing to watch my little blue spot walking down the street,” she explained. “I just find it completely magical and unbelievable.” The podcast on which Mirren appeared specifically focuses on technology in the post-COVID era and the ramifications of the rapid virtualization of our lives. Listen to the full interview below. Last month, it was announced that a newly edited version of the 1980 erotic film, Caligula, would be receiving a home release. The infamous film in which Mirren appeared is now available on DVD and Blu-Ray.",
