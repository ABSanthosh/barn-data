  "text": "Nelson passed away on Tuesday (Dec. 3) at 69 years old. Eminem performs during the Pepsi Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show at SoFi Stadium on Feb. 13, 2022 in Inglewood, Calif. Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images Eminem’s mother, Debbie Nelson, died at 69 years old as Billboard confirmed the tragedy on Tuesday (Dec. 3). TMZ was the first to report the news as the publication cited Nelson suffering from complications related to a lung cancer diagnosis and passed away in St. Joseph, Mo. As the oldest of five children, Nelson gave birth to a future rap phenom in Marshall Mathers III on Oct. 17, 1972 as just a teenager. Eminem and his mother’s relationship had been complicated and turbulent over the years. He had no issue incorporating parts of their relationship into his music, referencing Nelson on tracks such as “Cleanin’ Out My Closet,” “My Name Is” and more. Nelson even sued Em for defamation in 1999 seeking $11 million. Per ABC News, a judge ruled in her favor but for only $25,000 and she profited less than that after legal fees. “One of the things that I said and that I realized is, I mean at the end of the day, she’s my mother and I love her, because she’s mother,” Em said on BET’s 106 \u0026 Park in 2009. “I mean, even though we don’t really speak, she is my mother. I do love her and I think I got a better understanding of what she was going through or what she may be going through, now that I see myself and how I actually became. I think that’s there a little compassion factor that goes with that.” Over the years, Em began to understand what his mother was going through and he brought that to his music when extending an olive branch and expressing regret for how he handled certain things and apologized to Nelson on “Headlights” in 2013. In more recent times, things appeared to be going better between the two. Nelson publicly showed her son some love on Eminem’s induction day into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2022. “Marshall, I could not let this day go by without congratulating you on your induction to the Hall of Fame,” she said in a video. “I love you very much. I knew you’d get there. And it’s been a long ride.” Here are 10 songs Eminem made touching on his relationship with his mother below. “My Name Is” Year: 1999 Lyric: “I just found out my mom does more dope than I do/ I told her I’d grow up to be a famous rapper/ Make a record about doin’ drugs and name it after her.” Chart History: No. 36 (Billboard Hot 100) “Cleanin’ Out My Closet” Year: 2002 Lyric: “I’m sorry, mama/ I never meant to hurt you/ I never meant to make you cry/ But tonight I’m cleanin’ out my closet.” Chart History: No. 4 (Billboard Hot 100) “My Mom” Year: 2009 Lyric: “My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs/ That’s why I am like I am ’cause I’m like her/ Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs/ That’s why I’m on what I’m on ’cause I’m my mom.” Chart History: N/A “Our House” Year: 1999 Lyric: I’m gettin’ thinner, I’m hungry, is Mom cookin’ dinner/ Mom! Let me back in! I forgot my coat/ Mom, come on, I’m not playin’, it’s cold!/ Alright, sorry, I need a jacket.” Chart History: N/A “Headlights” Year: 2013 Lyric: “But regardless, I don’t hate you ‘cause, Ma/ You’re still beautiful to me, ‘cause you’re my mom/ Though far be it from you to be calm/ Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm.” Chart History: No. 45 (Billboard Hot 100) “Brain Damage” Year: 1999 Lyric: “My mother started screamin’, What are you on, drugs/ Look at you, you’re gettin’ blood all over my rug/ She beat me over the head with the remote control.” Chart History: N/A “Marshall Mathers” Year: 2000 Lyric: “My f—–g b—h mom’s suin’ for $10 million/ She must want a dollar for every pill I’ve been stealin’/ S–t, where the f–k you think I picked up the habit/ All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress.” Chart History: N/A “Stepdad” Year: 2020 Lyric: “I yelled for Mom (Mom) and as she’s rushin’ to my defense/ I stood up and said, ‘F–k you, punk’ and I took off and ran/ To my bedroom, as I fled.” Chart History: N/A “Insane” Year: 2009 Lyric: “He just hung himself in the bedroom, he’s dead/ Debbie, don’t let that f—-r get you upset/ Go in there, stick a f—-n’ cigarette to his neck.” [Fictional] Chart History: N/A “The Apple” Year: 2011 [Leaked/Unreleased] Lyric: “Ever since my mother was pregnant with a second egg/ Cause she said that I had a baby sister/ Who fell out of the window, I was too young to remember.” Chart History: N/A Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
