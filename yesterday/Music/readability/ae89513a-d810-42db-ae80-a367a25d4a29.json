Kanye West is royally bummed out by their fallout, but the same can’t be said for Jack White: “3 fucking nazi clowns collapsing under the weight of their own unchecked egos. More popcorn gruppenfuehrer!” the Detroit rocker wrote, captioning a photo of Musk, West, and Trump. “L to R: Joseph Noballs, Yedolf Hitler, and Herman Boring. Is America “Great” yet boys?” If you haven’t been following today’s events, Musk criticized Trump’s massive tax cuts and spending bill, sparking a huge social media war between the once-close allies. Musk hit the president where it hurts, claiming that Trump would have lost the election without his involvement and adding that Trump’s name is “in the Epstein files” — the “real reason” they haven’t been released publicly. In response, Trump countered by saying Musk didn’t leave his role as head of DOGE voluntarily, but was forced out by Trump (who claimed Musk was “wearing thin”). Trump also threatened to cancel all of Musk’s government contracts. Some of the president’s allies — including Steve Bannon — are now calling for Musk’s deportation back to South Africa.",
