  "text": "Every week, Consequence’s Songs of the Week column spotlights the best new tracks from the previous seven days and takes a look at notable releases. Find our new favorites and more on our Top Songs playlist, and for other great songs from emerging artists, you can listen to our New Sounds playlist. This week, Baltimore punk outfit Turnstile deliver a two-piece combo with “SEEIN’ STARS” and “BIRDS.” In 2021, Turnstile launched to the forefront of the ongoing hardcore revival with GLOW ON, a genuine crossover success that caused the humble act’s profile to skyrocket. Now, they’re finally set to return with a brand new album, NEVER ENOUGH, and thus far have shared three tracks to give fans a taste of what’s to come — the eponymous lead single and, as of this week, the two new songs “SEEIN’ STARS” and “BIRDS.” So, what do these new jams tell us? Get Turnstile Tickets Here Well, for one, Turnstile is waltzing further down the path they started upon with GLOW ON. That record saw the band fuse their punk and hardcore ragers with elements of shoegaze, indie rock, and even alternative R\u0026B. It still had riff-forward bangers, but washed-out, mid-tempo songs like “UNDERWATER BOI” and “ALIEN LOVE CALL” quickly became some of their most beloved songs. To some fans’dismay, “NEVER ENOUGH” proved that Turnstile has continued to embrace their sensitive side. Many listeners noted its similarities to GLOW ON, particularly the song “MYSTERY.” Intentionally or not, the next two singles, “SEEIN’ STARS” and “BIRDS,” seem to directly respond to such sentiments. “BIRDS” is the high-octane, aggressive barn-burner that most fans likely assumed Turnstile would come out of the gate with. After a 30-second drone intro that sounds like it came straight from Tyler, the Creator’s IGOR, ferocious guitars and screamed vocals attack the listener. Intro included, the whole thing is over within two-and-a-half minutes. Once they get going, there’s no fucking around. “SEEIN’ STARS,” on the other hand, reinforces the mood Turnstile established on “NEVER ENOUGH.” Forget walls of fuzzed-out guitars, the tune is downright groovy and soaked in reverb. It also features Dev Hynes (AKA Blood Orange) and Paramore’s Hayley Williams. (Though, if you didn’t know as much going in, you’d be forgiven for not noticing William’s contributions — not because they’re lackluster, but rather because they seem to be completely buried in the mix.) Put together, the two new cuts showcase that while Turnstile aren’t abandoning their hardcore roots anytime soon, they’re ready to continue exploring new sonic territories. They’ve still got the rippers in them, as proven with “BIRDS,” but it seems increasingly likely that GLOW ON marked a turning point in the band’s career. Turnstile are painting with a different palette now, and we’ll just have to wait for the rest of NEVER ENOUGH to find out how well they’re able to use it.
