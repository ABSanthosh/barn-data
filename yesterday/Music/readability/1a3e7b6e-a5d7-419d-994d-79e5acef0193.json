  "text": "Angie Stone, the veteran R\u0026B singer known for her songs “No More Rain (In This Cloud)” and “Wish I Didn’t Miss You,” has died at the age of 63. According to TMZ, Stone was killed in a car crash after a concert in Montgomery, Alabama, early Saturday morning. She had been scheduled to perform in Baltimore later that day. Stone first found success as a member of Sugar Hill Records’ hip-hop trio The Sequence, which scored a hit with “Funk You Up.” The song was later famously sampled by Bruno Mars on “Uptown Funk.” After signing to Arista Records, Stone released her debut solo album, Black Diamond, in 1999. The LP went on to achieve gold status, thanks in part to its No. 1 single, “No More Rain (In This Cloud).” Her sophomore album, 2001’s Mahogany Soul, released on Clive Davis’ J Records, boasted collaborations with Raphael Saadiq, Swizz Beatz, Alicia Keys, and Eve. Mahogany Soul reached No. 4 on the US Top R\u0026B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, with its single, “Wish I Didn’t Miss You,” becoming Stone’s biggest commercial single. The album also led to her first Grammy as the song “More Than Woman” was nominated for Best R\u0026B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Stone also notably contributed songwriting to D’Angelo’s first two albums, Brown Sugar and Voodoo, and provided backing vocals on Lenny Kravitz’s fifth album, 5. She also appeared in the 2002 comedy film The Hot Chick, and starred in a 2003 Broadway staging of Chicago. Stone continued to release music consistently over the last two decades, achieving varying degrees of commercial success. Her most recent album, Love Language, arrived in 2023.",
