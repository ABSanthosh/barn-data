Travis Kelce #87 of the Kansas City Chiefs celebrates with Taylor Swift after the AFC Championship football game against the Buffalo Bills, at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on January 26, 2025 in Kansas City, Missouri. Brooke Sutton/Getty Images Travis Kelce likely won’t be attending the 2025 Grammy Awards in Los Angeles to support his girlfriend, Taylor Swift — but he has a pretty good reason. In the lead-up to the Grammys ceremony at Crypto.com Arena on Sunday (Feb. 2), the Kansas City Chiefs tight end will be practicing with his team ahead of Super Bowl LIX, according to Page Six. Swift, who will be at the Grammys as a presenter, is nominated in six categories, including the top three — album, record and song of the year. She’s also vying for her fifth album of the year win with The Tortured Poets Department, which topped the Billboard 200 for 17 nonconsecutive weeks. Trending on Billboard Meanwhile, Kelce and the Chiefs are gearing up for their Super Bowl matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles on Feb. 9 at New Orleans’ Caesars Superdome. Swift is expected to attend the game, just like she did at last year’s Super Bowl. If the Chiefs win, they’ll become the first NFL team to claim three championships in a row. Kendrick Lamar will serve as the halftime performer at the game, where he’ll be joined by SZA. After the Chiefs’ AFC Championship win over the Buffalo Bills on Jan. 26, Kelce celebrated with his mother, Donna, and Swift on the field. In a video shared by the NFL, Swift marveled, “This is so insane,” as she urged Kelce to take in the scene at K.C.’s Arrowhead Stadium. “This is not a real-life situation.” This marks the second year Kelce won’t be able to attend the Grammys with Swift. In January 2024, he explained on The Pat McAfee Show, “I wish I could go support Taylor at the Grammys and watch her win every single award that she’s nominated for.” He added, “Unfortunately, I’ve got to get ready for this big ol’ Super Bowl we got in a week.” Last year, just hours after wrapping up her final Eras tour show in Tokyo, Swift flew to Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas to support Kelce and the Chiefs at Super Bowl LVIII. Following the team’s victory, she and Kelce shared a kiss on the field, and she affectionately watched as he gave a speech to the fans. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
