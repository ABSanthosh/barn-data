  "text": "Yasiin Bey (fka Mos Def) has announced Money Christmas, a new EP that will be performed live for a Bandcamp livestream later this month, marking the arrival of his first new music in five years. Scheduled to premiere on December 15th at 2:00 p.m. ET, Money Christmas will be a unique live project, with the Bandcamp description stating, “Whatever you think it is… it’s not that.” Livestream tickets are currently on sale for $7.99, and the video of the performance will be accessible for 48 hours, after which it will be available to purchase for $9.99. Additionally, the mastered audio tracks of the live EP will become available to download “24-48 hours after the performance.” According to the press release, the roll-out will be in “contrast” to how music is released “through traditional channels,” with access to the video and songs being granted through “the purchase of a QR code issued in conjunction with limited-edition merchandise including hoodies, t-shirts, stickers, and laminates to be sold on Bey’s Bandcamp in due course.” The EP will also be sold on vinyl in the coming months. Money Christmas will be the first solo music from Bey since his 2019 sound installation, Negus. For more information, head to the Bandcamp page for Money Christmas. You can also check out the album’s artwork (titled “Osanta Bin Lyin”) below. The announcement of Money Christmas comes just weeks after Black Star’s 2022 album No Fear of Time was finally released on vinyl and CD. Earlier in the year, Bey performed tour dates honoring the music of MF DOOM and celebrating the 15th anniversary of his 2009 album, The Ecstatic. He also made headlines for describing Drake’s music as not hip-hop, but pop that is “compatible with shopping.” Money Christmas Artwork:",
