  "text": "HBO has released a trailer for the upcoming second season of The Last of Us. Watch it below. The first season of The Last of Us premiered in January 2023 and became the most watched debut season of an HBO show at the time. Now, the second season is set to debut on HBO and Max beginning April 13th, and will loosely follow the plot of The Last of Us Part II, the second title in the original video game series that inspired the show. In addition to actors Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey — who will reprise their roles — the cast for the second season will be filled out by new characters portrayed by Kaitlyn Dever, Young Mazino, Isabela Merced, Catherine O’Hara, and others. Another trailer for The Last of Us Season 2 arrived last September, with the logline, “After five years of peace following the events of the first season, Joel and Ellie’s collective past catches up to them, drawing them into conflict with each other and a world even more dangerous and unpredictable than the one they left behind.” For more, revisit why Consequence ranked the first season of The Last of Us as one of the best TV shows of 2023.",
