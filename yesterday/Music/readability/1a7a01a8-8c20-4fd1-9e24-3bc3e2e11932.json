  "text": "Sean “Diddy” Combs has filed a defamation lawsuit NBCUniversal Media LLC, Peacock TV LLC, and Ample Entertainment over allegations aired in their recent Diddy: The Making of a Bad Boy documentary. In court documents, viewed by Pitchfork, Diddy and his legal team accuse the companies of “shamelessly capitalizing on the public’s insatiable appetite for content about Mr. Combs in the lead up to his criminal trial.” Combs is seeking $100 million in damages.The 90-minute documentary aired on Peacock last month, and featured interviews with with a bodyguard, makeup artist, and intern of Diddy’s, as well as Dawn Richard’s attorney Lisa Bloom and the R\u0026B artist Al B. Sure! The film delved into the the numerous allegations against Diddy, who is facing multiple lawsuits that accuse him of sexual assault, gang-rape, molestation, grooming, and more. Diddy is currently incarcerated and will stand trial on federal charges of racketeering, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution in May.In a statement accompanying the defamation lawsuit, Diddy’s attorney Erica A. Wolff wrote:As described in today’s lawsuit, NBCUniversal Media LLC, Peacock TV LLC, and Ample LLC made a conscious decision to line their own pockets at the expense of truth, decency, and basic standards of professional journalism. Grossly exploiting the trust of their audience and racing to outdo their competition for the most salacious Diddy exposé, defendants maliciously and recklessly broadcast outrageous lies in Diddy: The Making of a Bad Boy. In the purported documentary, defendants accuse Mr. Combs of horrible crimes, including serial murder and sexual assault of minors—knowing that there is no evidence to support them. In making and broadcasting these falsehoods, among others, defendants seek only to capitalize on the public’s appetite for scandal without any regard for the truth and at the expense of Mr. Combs’s right to a fair trial. Mr. Combs brings this lawsuit to hold defendants accountable for the extraordinary damage their reckless statements have caused.Pitchfork has reached out to representatives for Diddy: The Making of a Bad Boy for comment.If you or someone you know has been affected by sexual assault, we encourage you to reach out for support:RAINN National Sexual Assault Hotlinehttps://rainn.org1 800 656 HOPE (4673)Crisis Text LineSMS: Text “HELLO” or “HOLA” to 741-741",
