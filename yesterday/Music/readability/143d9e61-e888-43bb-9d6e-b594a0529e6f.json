Unfortunately the band has had to cancel all those dates over what they're calling \"unexpected circumstances within our camp.\" Here's hoping everything turns out alright for everyone in Void Of Vision and they can return to the road as soon as possible. If you're unfamiliar with Void Of Vision, check out the What I'll Leave Behind single \"Blood For Blood\" below and get the record here. \"To our North American fans \u0026 friends,\" wrote Void Of Vision. \"We regret to inform you that Void Of Vision will no longer be performing our upcoming dates throughout this November/December including all headline dates \u0026 support dates w/ The Ghost Inside. \"After careful consideration following unexpected circumstances within our camp the past month, we believe the best decision for all involved was to withdraw.
