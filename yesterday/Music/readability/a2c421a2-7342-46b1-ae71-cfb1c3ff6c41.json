  "text": "Plenty of Tool fans felt cheated over Tool's recent Live In The Sand festival performances. Tool promised fans \"two unique sets,\" but only delivered one unique set and then a second set half full of repeats – hence the booing and that one guy giving them the finger. Now it seems things are being taken one step further, as lawyer and Live In The Sand attendee Stasio French Rusek is considering filing a class action lawsuit against the band. Personally, I had seen some screenshots of a post about a lawsuit floating around, so I decided to call Rusek's firm and confirm – yeah, it's real. Rusek has since spoken to Metal Hammer, saying the lawsuit would be against the promoters of Live In The Sand over the phrasing of the advertising: \"These were my 27th and 28th Tool shows. There was a palpable sense of betrayal in the air as the show began the second night, and it lingered throughout the remainder of the weekend. \"What it boils down to is that purchasers of the festival package were promised 'two unique sets' by Tool. While the comments on these posts argue about what 'unique' means, the reality is that the opportunity to see Tool play two unique sets, ie no repeats, was the determining factor for most attendees to pull the trigger on spending thousands of dollars to attend.\" For those unaware, Tool's second set on March 8 consisted of eight songs, half of which they had performed the night before. This led to some people in the crowd booing the band and one even hanging a \"Fuck Maynard James Keenan\" sign outside their hotel room. The two sets were: March 7 \"Stinkfist\" \"Fear Inoculum\" \"Rosetta Stoned\" \"Pneuma\" \"Jambi\" \"Schism\" \"The Grudge\" \"The Flood\" \"Invincible\" \"Vicarious\" (first time since 2020) March 8 \"Fear Inoculum\" \"Ænema\" \"Rosetta Stoned\" \"Pneuma\" \"Jambi\" \"Descending\" \"Chocolate Chip Trip\" \"Intolerance\" \"Swamp Song\" Tool's touring plans outside the festival are (so far) contained to South America.
