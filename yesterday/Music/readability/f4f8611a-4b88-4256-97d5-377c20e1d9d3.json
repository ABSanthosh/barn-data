  "text": "LeAnn Rimes didn’t let an onstage dental mishap get her down earlier this week. The country-pop singer recently powered through a show at The Skagit Casino Resort in Bow, Washington, despite her front dental bridge falling out while she was performing her 1996 single, “One Way Ticket.” Get LeAnn Rimes Tickets Here “I feel something pop in my mouth,” Rimes explained in an Instagram video after the gig. “And if you’ve been around, you know I’ve had a lot of dental surgeries and I have a bridge in the front, and it fell out in the middle of my song last night.” Rimes handled the situation like a pro, returning to the stage and getting the bridge back in place to finish the show. “This is the most epic example of how the show must go on,” the singer continued. “I don’t usually have firsts in my career, that was a first and hopefully a last.” She went on to explain how she had to continually push her bridge in position throughout the show, and that during the song “Can’t Fight the Moonlight,” the teeth fell out again, this time in her mouth. “The show can go on, even in the midst of sheer, utter embarrassment,” Rimes added. “You just gotta be real with people.” The singer’s extensive dental struggles are well documented, with a history of botched work that’s resulted in 29 surgeries and a 2013 lawsuit against her former dentist. Rimes will return to the road and test her latest dental work beginning on July 12th in Honolulu, Hawaii. She’s also set to swing through Australia with a trio of dates, as well as appear on next year’s Top Shelf Country Cruise. See her itinerary below, and get tickets here.
