  "text": "After nearly a decade of silence, Gorguts have officially entered the studio to work on a new record! In a message to fans, the band confirmed they’re deep into the early stages of pre-production at Colin Marston's new studio, working on what will become their long-awaited follow-up to 2016's Pleiades' Dust. \"Hello dear Gorguthians, many of you have been asking about new material and updates from the band, so here's the latest: the guys are currently at Colin Marston's new studio in Pennsylvania, USA,\" wrote Gorguts. \"They've just spent three days recording pre-production demos for four new songs intended for the upcoming album. There's no official release date yet, but you can expect the album sometime around 2026. Stay tuned!\" The new Gorguts record will be the follow-up to their 2016 record Pleiades' Dust. Pleiades' Dust features a single 33-minute track divided into seven distinct movements. The EP narrates the rise and fall of the House of Wisdom, an important medieval knowledge center in Baghdad from the 9th to 13th centuries. It begins with the fall of Rome (~500 CE), follows the founding of Baghdad in 762 CE, and ends with the Mongol destruction in 1258 CE. Gorguts in 2025 is mastermind Luc Lemay on guitar and vocals, guitarist Kevin Hufnagel (Dysrhythmia), bassist Colin Marston (Behold the Arctopus, Dysrhythmia, Krallice, etc.), and drummer Michel Bélanger.
