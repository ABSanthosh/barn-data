Sir Lucian Grainge, Chairman \u0026 CEO, Universal Music Group said, “When we first presented our vision for the next stage in the evolution of music subscription several months ago—Steaming 2.0—this is precisely the kind of partnership development we envisioned. This agreement furthers and broadens the collaboration with Spotify for both our labels and music publisher, advancing artist-centric principles to drive greater monetization for artists and songwriters, as well as enhancing product offerings for consumers.”Daniel Ek, Spotify’s Founder and CEO, said, “For nearly two decades, Spotify has made good on its commitment to return the music industry to growth, ensuring that we deliver record payouts to the benefit of artists and songwriters each new year. This partnership ensures we can continue to deliver on this promise by embracing the certainty that constant innovation is key to making paid music subscriptions even more attractive to a broader audience of fans around the world.” Behind the scenes, there remains some debate over the suggestion – put forward from MBW sources in our earlier story – that the new deal essentially ends the controversial ‘bundle’-related discount rate that has been applied to US royalty payouts from Spotify to UMPG since Q1 2024.Here’s our understanding as things stand:Via the new direct deal with UMPG, the royalties paid to the publishing company and its songwriters in the US from Spotify will change;Our sources maintain that, in terms of royalty sums paid by Spotify to UMPG, the effect of the bundle-related discount over the past year will effectively be nullified going forward, and payouts to UMPG and its songwriters will rise;However, within the private UMPG and Spotify agreement, there remains a value differentiation between a music-plus-audiobooks user vs. a music-only user.On this matter, in reaction to our story earlier, a Spotify spokesperson said: “Spotify maintains its bundle, but with this direct deal [with UMPG], it has evolved to account for broader rights, including a different economic treatment for music and non-music content.”The new official press release from UMG and Spotify about their fresh deal is published below in full for your delectation.
