  "text": "Former Marvel mainstay Scarlett Johansson has expressed her confusion over the fact that 2019’s Avengers: Endgame did not receive a Best Picture nomination at the 2020 Academy Awards. “How did this film not get nominated for an Oscar?” she said in a new interview with Vanity Fair. While Endgame did receive a nomination for best visual effects, Johansson felt that the movie deserved more consideration, noting that “it was an impossible movie that should not have worked, that really works as a film — and also, it’s one of the most successful films of all time.” Despite her affection for Endgame, the star did confirm that at this time, her character will remain permanently dead in the MCU. “I miss my buddies and really would love to be with them forever, but what works about the character is that her story is complete. I don’t want to mess with that. For fans too — it’s important for them.” Johansson will next appear in the form of host for this weekend’s Saturday Night Live season finale. Here’s a preview of what to expect.",
