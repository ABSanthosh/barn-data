  "text": "Tonight, July 4, Oasis kicked off their long-anticipated reunion tour at Principality Stadium in Cardiff, Wales. Taking the stage together for the first time since their bitter breakup in 2009, Liam and Noel Gallagher ran through a set of hits and fan-favorites from across their discography, beginning with (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?’s “Hello” and making fans wait until late into the show for songs like “Wonderwall” and “Champagne Supernova.” Check out the full setlist and photos from the show below.Rumors of an Oasis reunion have circulated since at least 2017, when Noel Gallagher stood Liam up at a benefit concert for victims of the Ariana Grande Manchester concert bombing. Since the split, both Gallagher brothers have pursued their own projects, with Liam recording under his own name and Noel as Noel Gallagher’s Flying Birds. When news of a tour was confirmed last year, they wrote, in a press statement: “The guns have fallen silent. The stars have aligned. The great wait is over. Come see. It will not be televised.The first leg of Oasis Live ’25 will extend through the end of August, with the Gallaghers slated to play multiple shows in each of Manchester, London, Edinburgh, and Dublin. Dates in North and South America, as well as Australia, are scheduled throughout the remainder of the year. Exorbitant ticket prices, caused by Ticketmaster’s “dynamic pricing” model, have led to scrutiny from European regulators. The tour will be documented as a concert film produced by Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight and directed by Dylan Southern and Will Lovelace.Oasis were among the nominees for the Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame’s Class of 2025 but did not make the final cut. The Britpop titans recently shared that they’ll be reissuing their sophomore album, 1995’s (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?, in celebration of its 30th anniversary. Out October 3, the deluxe edition will include unplugged versions of “Cast No Shadow,” “Morning Glory,” “Wonderwall,” “Champagne Supernova,” and the single B-side “Acquiesce.”Oasis:HelloAcquiesceMorning GlorySome Might SayBring It on DownCigarettes \u0026 AlcoholFade AwaySupersonicRoll With ItTalk TonightHalf the World AwayLittle by LittleD’You Know What I Mean?Stand by MeCast No ShadowSlide AwayWhateverLive ForeverRock ‘n’ Roll StarThe MasterplanDon’t Look Back in AngerWonderwallChampagne SupernovaCARDIFF, WALES - JULY 3: Oasis-inspired graffiti mural by Cardiff-based artist Rmer on July 3, 2025 in Cardiff, Wales.
