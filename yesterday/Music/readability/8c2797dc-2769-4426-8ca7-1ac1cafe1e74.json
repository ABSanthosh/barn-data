  "text": "Cradle Of Filth guitarist Marek \"Ashok\" Šmerda and keyboardist Zoë Marie Federoff got married this week, making for arguably one of the most metal weddings in recent memory. Cradle Of Filth frontman Dani Filth posted plenty of photos from the ceremony, all of which you can find below. And perhaps most importantly – congrats to the happy couple! \"SMERDA THEY WROTE,\" wrote Filth in his post about the wedding. \"We had an absolutely wonderful day yesterday celebrating the marriage of Ashok and Zoe in Tucson, Arizona amidst a plethora of family and friends. \"Congratulations to the married couple…. Mr and Mrs Smerda! What a great day! The reception and subsequent party thereafter were fantastic and therefore today requires a bit of comfort food and a whopping big band aid.\" Federoff explained in a social media post roughly one year ago that she was not dating Šmerda at the time of joining Cradle Of Filth in 2022, and that their romance had nothing to do with her hiring. \"First of all, thank you all so much for your warm wishes and congratulations,\" wrote Federoff at the time. \"Secondly, I truly wish I didn't feel the need to completely clear this up but there's a lot of strange rumors and stories floating around so, take note: \"I never knew Ashok before I joined CoF. He had nothing to do with me coming on board. I have already written some material for the next CoF album so clearly our engagement has nothing to do with my continued stay in this band. \"We have no plans to leave CoF as we truly enjoy working together, not to mention working with several of our closest friends. Dani has been the greatest and most supportive leader possible when it comes to our engagement. We remain happily committed to his team in CoF. Now please- stop speculating and spreading rumors and let's celebrate all the good things happening this year!\" Want More Metal?
