  "text": "Demon Hunter hasn't released a new album since their 2022 effort Exile, but they've been intermittently releasing new songs as standalone singles. The latest is \"I'm Done\" which comes alongside a music video directed by vocalist Ryan Clark. It's worth noting that this is the sixth Demon Hunter single we've gotten in the past two years, so at this point I wouldn't be surprised if we got a new album compiling those and some new songs eventually. Check that out above and go see Demon Hunter at one of their only two 2025 tour dates. 9/19 Louisville, KY Louder Than Life10/4 Sacramento, CA Aftershock Want More Metal?
