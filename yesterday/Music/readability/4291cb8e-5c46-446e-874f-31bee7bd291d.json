  "text": "Def Leppard and Mötley Crüe are teaming up to headline the first-ever Rock the Tides destination festival, set for November 7th through 9th in Riviera Maya, Mexico. The festival is being presented by Festication, the same people who put together the Tool in the Sand festival earlier this year. In addition to the two headliners, Rock the Tides will feature Bret Michaels, Living Colour, Extreme, The Struts, Buckcherry, Dorothy, Moon Walker, and Velvet Daydream. “Mexico has always been one of the most electric places we’ve played — the energy is just unreal,” stated Mötley Crüe. “Some of our most unforgettable shows have happened there, and we know this one will be no different. We’re excited to head back, team up with Def Leppard, and throw one hell of a party for everyone making the trip.” In addition to witnessing performances from each of the music acts mentioned above, Rock the Tides attendees will be able to stay at either the Barceló Maya Grande or the Barceló Riviera Maya (adults only), both five-star resorts located along the beach. Mötley Crüe recently had to postpone some dates of their Las Vegas residency until the fall due to singer Vince Neil undergoing an undisclosed “medical procedure.” It appears that he will be ready to go for the rescheduled Vegas dates in September, as well as the Rock the Tides fest in November. A pre-sale for Rock the Tides starts Wednesday (April 23rd) at the official festival website. The full lineup can be seen in the poster below.",
