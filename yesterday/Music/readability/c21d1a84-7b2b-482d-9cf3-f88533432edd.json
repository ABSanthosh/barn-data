  "text": "Cradle of Filth members Zoë M. Federof (keyboards, vocals) and Marek Ashok Šmerda (guitar) just got married, a year after announcing their engagement. The happy news was shared on Instagram by frontman Dani Filth, who posted a gallery of photos from the wedding, writing, “We had an absolutely wonderful day yesterday celebrating the marriage of Ashok and Zoe in Tucson, Arizona amidst a plethora of family and friends.” Get Cradle of Filth Tickets Here He added, “Congratulations to the married couple…. Mr and Mrs Smerda! What a great day! The reception and subsequent party thereafter were fantastic and therefore today requires a bit of comfort food and a whopping big band aid.” Šmerda has been a member of the UK extreme metal act since 2014, while Federof joined the band in 2022. After announcing their engagement in January 2024, Federof took to social media to explain that she did not know Šmerda before becoming a member of Cradle of Filth. “First of all, thank you all so much for your warm wishes and congratulations,” began Federoff at the time. “Secondly, I truly wish I didn’t feel the need to completely clear this up but there’s a lot of strange rumors and stories floating around so, take note: I never knew Ashok before I joined CoF. He had nothing to do with me coming on board. I have already written some material for the next CoF album so clearly our engagement has nothing to do with my continued stay in this band.” The nuptials took place ahead of a busy schedule for Cradle of Filth. The band will co-headline the Chaos \u0026 Carnage extreme metal package tour with Dying Fetus this spring. The US outing kicks off April 17th in Berkeley, California, and runs through a May 14th show in Denver, with tickets available here. Furthermore, Cradle of Filth are set to release a new album in 2025. While not officially announced, Dani Filth recently revealed to Metal Hammer that the title is The Screaming of the Valkyries, and that it will likely arrive in early April. However, the LP will not include a much-anticipated collaboration between Dani and pop superstar Ed Sheeran that still hasn’t seen the light of day since being recorded a few years ago. This past Halloween, Cradle of Filth released the single “Malignant Perfection,” which was named our Heavy Song of the Week at the time. See photos the wedding between Cradle of Filth members Zoë M. Federof and Marek Ashok Šmerda in Dani Filth’s Instagram post below.",
