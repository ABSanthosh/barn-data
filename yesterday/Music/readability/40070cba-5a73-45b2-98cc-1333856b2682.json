  "text": "Bambii, the Toronto DJ and producer, has announced a new EP: Infinity Club II is out June 20 via Because Music. The 12-track release is led by the new song “Mirror,” featuring Jessy Lanza and Yaeji, and it also comes with a music video. Directed by Bambii, that visual flashes through close-up shots of bird feathers, swimming fish, all three artists in their daily lives, and more. Watch it below.As the name implies, Infinity Club II serves as a sequel to 2023’s Infinity Club. The upcoming EP includes features from Ravyn Lenae, Aluna, Beam, Lamsi, SadBoi, Lady Lykez, £Monzo, and other artists, and is billed as merging Bambii’s typical spin on dance with her Caribbean roots, global club, and more.In the time since that last release, Bambii dropped the singles “Shh” and “Spit,” in 2024, toured with acts like Jamie xx, and hopped on the Shygirl track “Flex” from her Club Shy Room 2 EP.Read about “Wicked Gyal” in “The 100 Best Songs of 2023.”Infinity Club II EP:01 Infinity Club II02 Remember [ft.
