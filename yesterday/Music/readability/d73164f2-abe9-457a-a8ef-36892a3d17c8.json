  "text": "Snapcase is finally getting their own documentary after kicking ass in the punk and hardcore world for over 30 years. Snapcase has teamed up with Fourth.Media and filmmakers Nathaniel Shannon and William Saunders (the guys behind Deadguy: Killing Music) for the first official, feature-length documentary Snapcase: Legacy. The documentary is set to feature exclusive interviews with key figures in the hardcore scene, unreleased archival footage, live performances, and more. Filming began in July 2023, with live performances and interviews captured at Snapcase's show at Crossroads in Garwood, New Jersey. With picture lock slated for October 2025, Snapcase: Legacy is on track for film festival submissions, screenings, and online distribution shortly thereafter. This is where you come in – A Kickstarter campaign was just launched seeking $40,000, which you can check out right here. Anyone that may have access to or possession of old, unreleased, or never-before-seen footage is encouraged to fill this form as well. Also, feel free to use this post as a reminder that Snapcase's 1997 record Progression Through Unlearning is still a rager, and that you should probably revisit it today. Want More Metal?
