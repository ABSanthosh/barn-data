  "text": "Former Megadeth guitarist Marty Friedman has always been known for his innovative approach to music and life. In a recent interview with Ultimate Guitar, the celebrated musician shared some provocative insights on mastering the guitar, which go against the grain of what most musicians consider essential for improvement. As one of the most proficient and revered players in the world, known for his intricate technical mastery and musicality, it may seem surprising that Friedman doesn't follow the typical practice regimen. But according to him, this approach has served him just fine. When asked about his practice routine, Friedman made a bold revelation: \"I haven't practiced in probably three decades because I'm playing guitar so incredibly much, all of the time: either performing, writing, rehearsing, recording.\" Instead of committing to dedicated practice sessions, he finds that real-world experience provides a far more beneficial way to improve his musicianship, and draws an unexpected parallel between playing music and intimate relationships: \"Everything that I always say about this can be related to sex in some way,\" Friedman remarked. He emphasized the distinction between solitary practice and live performance, stating, \"If you practice at home, you're going to get good at practicing at home. If you go out and do the real thing [performing onstage], you're going to get good at doing the real thing. So all that stuff, all relates to any double entendre that you can imagine\" Having been performing live since his early teens, Friedman attributes much of his growth as a musician to real-life applications. \"I've been very lucky that I've been playing live since I was 14-15, so all I've been doing since then is creating music and performing it, and oftentimes having to explain it… whether it be guitar seminars or music videos for instructional things. So, I have to know exactly what it is I'm doing.\" One of the most compelling points Friedman made is that the act of performing, recording, and even creating music videos is an invaluable practice in itself. He recalls the meticulous work it took to perform his nuanced music for a recent video, \"And when they're showing your fingers, you gotta know exactly what it is you're playing on that record.\" He stresses that this real-world focus provides a far more rewarding outcome than the repetition of licks and scales at home: \"And my music is very, very nuanced, so it took quite a bit of work to get my fingers exactly the same as what's on the record. And so doing that is far more beneficial to my end goal than practicing. I wouldn't even know what to practice. So I recommend this to people.\" So, what does Friedman recommend to guitarists looking to improve? He advises that aspiring players prioritize creating opportunities to play in front of others – whether in a band, a live setting, or recording. \"A lot of people will say, 'Well, I'm not in a band, and I don't get to play in front of people, and I'm not recording.' So what I say to them is you have to make the top priority not the practicing of your licks or whatever you're practicing. Your top priority has got to be creating opportunities to play in front of people. That is your top priority. That is going to suit your end goal much better.\" According to Friedman, by performing, guitarists are forced to put in the work that leads to true improvement: \"And on the course of doing that, you will develop, believe me, the things that your hands need to do because when you have a gig in front of people, whether it be a guitar seminar or a guitar clinic or a concert or a music video or anything, you're going to work on the material for that so much harder than you would sitting at home with no goals.\" Ultimately, Friedman believes the key to becoming a better guitarist isn't about endless hours of practice at home – it's about networking, creating connections, and finding gigs. \"Instead of practicing, don't practice. Practice networking. Practice putting together a band. Practice putting together gigs for yourself. That's going to really be a very beneficial thing I recommend.\" Want More Metal?
