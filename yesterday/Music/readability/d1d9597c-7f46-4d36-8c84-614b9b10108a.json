  "text": "The 15 shows were scheduled to begin in February and run through May at Planet Hollywood's PH Live. Black Eyed Peas Nabil Elderkin* The Black Eyed Peas have canceled their upcoming Las Vegas residency scheduled for 2025. On Sunday (Jan. 19), the group announced through their Instagram Story that their planned shows at Planet Hollywood Resort \u0026 Casino’s PH Live would no longer take place due to “current circumstances.” “To our dearest Peabodies,” the Black Eyed Peas wrote. “It is with a heavy heart that, in light of current circumstances, our Las Vegas shows will not be moving forward as planned.” The trio of will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo also added, “Ticket providers will issue full refunds automatically. Stay tuned for updates on future performances by following us — we can’t wait to see you again.” Originally announced in September 2024, the residency — titled Black Eyed Peas: 3008 The Las Vegas Experience — was set to launch on Feb. 15 at PH Live. The group had planned to perform 15 concerts at the 7,000-capacity venue, with shows spread across three different runs through May. Trending on Billboard “Our first residency in Las Vegas gives Black Eyed Peas the opportunity to do what we do best: dream up something brand new and creative that pushes the boundaries of the live show experience,” will.i.am said in a statement at the time. “We draw inspiration from Disney rides, Las Vegas shows, concerts, AI, and technology. We will reinvent how we perform, creating an interactive show, a journey to 3008 that is both a concert and a play. I can’t wait for the world to see what we cook up in Las Vegas.” Billboard has reached out to Black Eyed Peas’ representatives for further comment on the cancellation. The group’s most recent album, Elevation, was released in 2022. Last May, the Black Eyed Peas released the track “Tonight” with El Alfa featuring Becky G, which was part of the Bad Boys: Ride or Die soundtrack. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
