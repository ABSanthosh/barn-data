  "text": "Pophouse Entertainment, the Sweden-based music investment firm co-founded by ABBA’s Björn Ulvaeus, has appointed Jessica Koravos as its new CEO, effective January 2026.According to a press release issued on Friday (July 4),  Per Sundin, Pophouse’s current CEO, will remain in the role until Koravos joins in January 2026, and will “support a smooth and orderly process” before assuming a new role within the company.The statement added that Sundin, who Pophouse said “has played a crucial role in shaping the company’s strategic direction and building a strong foundation for long-term success,” will transition to a new role “defined around his experience in and knowledge of the entertainment industry”.Pophouse’s incoming CEO, Jessica Koravos, previously served as President of Oak View Group International, where she led international arena development projects, “navigating multiple high-value infrastructure investments and partnerships across global markets”.Prior to that, Koravos was President of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s The Really Useful Group, managing global licensing and production for titles such as The Phantom of the Opera, Cats, and Jesus Christ Superstar.Koravos was also a member of the Board of ABBA Voyage, the ABBA avatar show in London.According to Pophouse, as a “highly regarded international business executive with extensive experience and a proven track record of expanding entertainment and live production ventures globally, [Koravos] is well-positioned to oversee Pophouse’s next phase of growth”.News of the company’s leadership change arrives around three months after Pophouse announced that it had raised over EUR €1.2 billion (USD $1.3 billion) to invest in music catalogs and IP.The Stockholm-based company’s debut fund, Pophouse Fund I, raised over €1 billion ($1.1 billion), reaching its hard cap and making it, Pophouse, claimed, “one of the largest first-time private equity funds to be raised in Europe in the last decade”.Pophouse secured an additional €200 million ($216m) through dedicated co-investment vehicles, “providing investors the opportunity to invest alongside the Fund and participate in select transactions”.The company said it had already deployed about 30% of the fund via partnerships with artists such as American rock band KISS, pop singer Cyndi Lauper, and Swedish electronic dance music artists Avicii and Swedish House Mafia.Although Pophouse is most commonly associated with the wildly popular ABBA Voyage avatar show (operated by a separate UK-based holding company, Aniara Ltd.), the firm’s investment portfolio includes various other immersive productions like The Avicii Experience in Stockholm, Mamma Mia! The Party, ABBA The Museum, and the soon-to-be-launched KISS avatar show in Las Vegas.The company also said on Friday that it “has an exciting pipeline of new collaborations and creative projects in the works”.The statement added that under Koravos’ leadership, Pophouse will be focused on “significantly expanding its portfolio and productions across the world, creating groundbreaking content at the intersection of music, entertainment, and technology”.Pophouse noted that in her role as President of Oak View Group, Koravos established “a strong international management team” with operational hubs in London, Madrid, and Abu Dhabi.Koravos was also responsible for overseeing the development and launch of the Co-op Live arena in the UK, now set to host the BRIT Awards’ move to Manchester in 2026.Pophouse was founded by ABBA’s Björn Ulvaeus and EQT founder Conni Jonsson, and is chaired by Lennart Blecher, EQT’s Head of Real Assets.“This leadership transition represents a pivotal moment in Pophouse’s evolution and underscores the company’s mission to redefine the entertainment landscape.”Lennart Blecher, PophouseLennart Blecher, Chair at Pophouse, commented: “This leadership transition represents a pivotal moment in Pophouse’s evolution and underscores the company’s mission to redefine the entertainment landscape.“Jessica brings a proven track record of driving sustained growth across entertainment and live production ventures on a global scale, and her leadership in securing international licensing partnerships and delivering iconic IPs to audiences throughout Europe, Asia and the US aligns perfectly with our ambitious expansion goals – for example Mamma Mia! The Party and the upcoming KISS avatar show. I am truly thrilled to welcome Jessica to Pophouse.”Blecher added: “I would like to thank Per for all he has contributed to put Pophouse firmly on the map. We are delighted that Per will continue to be a vital part of the team and we all at Pophouse look forward to continuing our collaboration.”“I look forward to driving the future expansion and success of the business.”Jessica KoravosJessica Koravos, incoming CEO of Pophouse, said: “I am truly delighted to be joining Pophouse at this exciting time.“Having seen Pophouse’s tremendous growth – driven by their compelling strategy, powerful partnerships with global artists, inspiring Board and excellent team. I look forward to driving the future expansion and success of the business.”Music Business Worldwide",
