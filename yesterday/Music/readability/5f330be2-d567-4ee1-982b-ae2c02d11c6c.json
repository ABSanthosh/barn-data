  "text": "In a surprise twist during an already historic weekend, Kelly Osbourne and Sid Wilson of Slipknot got engaged backstage at Ozzy Osbourne’s farewell concert on July 5. The emotional moment unfolded behind the scenes at Back To The Beginning in Birmingham, with Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne — along with a crowd of friends and family — witnessing the proposal firsthand. After years of dating and recently welcoming their first child together, Wilson popped the question just before Ozzy took the stage for his final performance with Black Sabbath. Kelly said yes, and the backstage area erupted in celebration. Congratulations to the happy couple! Kelly and Sid first met in 1999 at Ozzfest. They stayed close over the years, with no romantic involvement until around 2013, when they reconnected at Sid’s record shop in Los Angeles and Kelly learned that Sid had secretly harbored feelings for her. Nearly a decade later, in early 2022, they went public with their relationship, celebrating Sid’s 45th birthday and expressing their deep affection on social media. In May of that year, Kelly announced she was expecting their first child, and their son Sidney was born later in 2022. Their journey as a couple culminated in their first red carpet appearance together at the 2024 Grammy Awards, publicly solidifying their bond. Kelly has since shared that she was surprised to learn of Sid’s long-held affection, but their relationship evolved naturally from friendship to family. Their story highlights mutual respect, long-term connection, and personal growth as the foundation of their love. Kelly later reflected on their long history in an Instagram post celebrating their first Valentine’s Day as a couple. \"After 23 years of friendship I can’t believe where we have ended up!” she wrote, alongside a photo of the two kissing. “You are my best friend, my soulmate and I am so deeply in love with you Sidney George Wilson.\" Sid Wilson echoed the sentiment by reposting the same photo on his own Instagram, adding a heartfelt message: \"There is not enough colours to display the palette of Love I have for you in my Heart ???? Happy Valentines Day my Love XoXo.\" Want More Metal?
