  "text": "Last month, The Cure celebrated the release of their comeback album, Songs of a Lost World, by playing an intimate concert at Troxy London. Now, the band has announced a companion release collecting all eight songs from their new album as they were performed at the show. Aptly titled Songs of a Live World: Troxy London MMXXIV, the live set will be available in a variety of configurations beginning December 13th, including as a single CD and single vinyl set, as well as packaged together as double CD and double LP set with Songs of a Lost World. Additionally, The Cure have announced a special “Blood Red Mood” vinyl variant of Songs of a Lost World. Proceeds from the release will benefit War Child UK, which supports children in areas impacted by war and conflict. Pre-orders are now ongoing via the band’s website. The Cure’s concert at Troxy London featured a career-spanning 31-song set that also included classic hits and fan favorites, as well as a surprise five-song mini set of songs from their 1980 sophomore album, Seventeen Seconds. The entire show was streamed live online via YouTube and can still be replayed in full here. Marking The Cure’s first new album in 18 years, Songs of a Lost World went No. 1 on five Billboard charts in the US, including Billboard’s Top Album Sales, Vinyl Albums, Top Rock \u0026 Alternative Albums, Top Rock Albums, and Top Alternative Albums charts. It also debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200, marking the band’s best performance on that chart since releasing Wish in 1992.",
