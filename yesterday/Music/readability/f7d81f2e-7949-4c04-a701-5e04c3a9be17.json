  "text": "It is the most dates any artist has ever played during a single tour in the Latin American country. Shakira performs at the GNP Seguros Stadium in Mexico City on March 19, 2025. OCESA / Lulu Urdapilleta Español Shakira continues being unstoppable! The Colombian superstar announced on Monday (April 7) four additional dates for her historic Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour in Mexico, once again surpassing her own record with a total of 26 concerts in the Latin American country. The new cities hosting her shows are Tijuana, Hermosillo, Chihuahua, and Torreón, according to promoter OCESA. “Due to the enormous demand and the cultural impact Shakira has in Mexico, four new dates have been added to the artist’s return in August. This second leg of her tour in the country will take her to new territories, reaching every corner to reconnect with her ‘pack’ and meet her fans where they are,” the promoter said in a press release. Consequently, Shakira will bring her show to the northern part of the country, performing on August 11 at Estadio Caliente in Tijuana, Baja California; on August 14 at Estadio Héroes de Nacozari in Hermosillo, Sonora; on August 17 at Estadio UACH in Chihuahua; and on August 20 at Estadio Corona in Torreón, Coahuila. Trending on Billboard After making history with seven consecutive sold-out shows at Estadio GNP Seguros, the Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour will return to Mexico City for another four concerts at the stadium on August 26, 27, 29, and 30, for a total of 11. This will make Shakira the first artist to achieve such a number of dates at this major venue (formerly known as Foro Sol). Shakira, who has been adding dates to the tour as tickets continue to sell out, now ties the record of seven dates at Estadio GNP Seguros with Grupo Firme, who are set to give their eighth show there on June 28. The success of her monumental stadium trek has led the “Hips Don’t Lie” singer to top Billboard‘s Top Tours chart in February, when she kicked off the tour in Brazil, making her the first Latina solo artist to achieve this feat. Shakira’s tour has left an indelible mark across Latin America, gathering more than a million attendees, according to OCESA. The Barranquilla-born artist was also named by Billboard as the No. 1 star among the Best 50 Female Latin Pop Artists of All Time last month. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
