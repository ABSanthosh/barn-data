  "text": "Metric have dropped out of their joint North American tour with Bloc Party, citing “sudden production decisions” from the latter’s team that breached a previous agreement. “We were so excited going into this tour and we’d all landed on an agreement that would allow both parties to collaborate and to build a truly special show for the fans,” Metric shared in an Instagram statement. “In the last few weeks, Bloc Party’s team made some sudden production decisions that broke the agreement we’d made, which left us unable to continue despite our best efforts to find solutions.” Get Metric Tickets Here In lieu of those dates, Metric have scheduled a handful of new shows in Ottawa, Québec City, and Montreal, where they’ll play their 2009 album, Fantasies, in full. They’ve also announced that Sam Roberts Band are stepping in for Bloc Party during their June 6th concert in Toronto. See their updated schedule below. Tickets for the new dates will first be available through a Live Nation pre-sale (use code DANCE) on Monday, April 14th at 10:00 a.m. local time, followed by the general on-sale on Tuesday, April 15th at 10:00 a.m. local time via Ticketmaster.
