  "text": "As of January 9th, wildfires are continuing to ravage the Los Angeles area. Beginning with a devastating blaze in the Pacific Palisades, the ongoing LA wildfires have already destroyed thousands of homes and other structures and claimed at least five lives. The fires have spread across a vast portion of the county, reaching into the metro area and putting countless residents, businesses, and natural landmarks at risk. The battle is far from over for the firefighters and first responders working to combat the fires as people continue to evacuate, and the road to recovery for Los Angeles will be lengthy. Here are some ways to help as organizations and non-profits prepare their plans for the path forward. MusiCares: The charity wing of The Grammys organization provides crisis relief, preventive care, recovery resources, and financial assistance for people across all music professions. Music industry professionals are encouraged to reach out to MusiCares (musicaresrelief@musicares.org) for “emergency funds related to evacuation and relocation costs, instrument replacement and repair, home damage, medical care, mental health services, and other essential living needs.” You can donate to MusiCares and assist in their recovery efforts here. Sweet Relief Musicians Fund: This organization provides financial assistance to musicians and industry members struggling to make ends meet. They’ve launched a fund specifically for those in the LA area affected by the disaster; applications and donation links can both be found here. Music Community Fire Loss Donations: Here is an ongoing spreadsheet for individuals across the industry seeking assistance. Donate to them directly. LA Fire Department: Donate and support the firefighters on the frontlines. The LAFD Foundation works to provide both equipment and funds to departments across the city; find ways to support, either by donating or purchasing LAFD merch, here. YMCA – Los Angeles: The YMCA offers free access to amenities to displaced residents. The YMCA locations throughout LA are currently converting into temporary evacuation sites, offering shelter, showers, and basic amenities; the Koreatown Center for Community Well-Being and Westchester YMCA are now designated as primary donation sites. They’re seeking essential items for fire-affected families, while those hoping to donate can reach out to: CelinaSatiago@ymcaLA.org. SAG-AFTRA Foundation: Many Los Angeles residents work in entertainment, and the SAG-AFTRA Foundation shared that members of any union in LA County, including SAG-AFTRA, can apply here for rent, mortgage, utilities, or food assistance in the coming days and months. Union members and retirees can also apply for $3,000 of relief here, while SAG-AFTRA has shared instructions on how to apply for their in-house disaster relief fund. See the full list of emergency resources from SAG-AFTRA here. California Fire Foundation: As the blaze continues and firefighters remain in danger, keep this organization in mind. The California Fire Foundation provides multiple forms of assistance to families of fallen firefighters, firefighters, and community members. Learn the ways to donate and support here. World Central Kitchen: When crises arise, World Central Kitchen mobilizes to provide meals. Their Emergency Food Relief program serves fresh food to those affected by disasters like these fires — the California team has already sprung into action to work with restaurants and food trucks. Support WCK here. California Community Foundation: The Wildlife Recovery Fund from the California Community Foundation works to support people both in the immediate aftermath and in the long term, especially as natural disaster recovery can take months or years. CCF doesn’t accept physical donations, but welcome monetary contributions. Learn more about the Wildlife Recovery Fund and donate here. Mutual Aid LA: MALAN has shared a collection of available resources throughout the city, from animal boarding to places with working WiFi, essential item distribution, and shelters. See the spreadsheet here, and support their efforts through their website. United Way: United Way is one of the largest fundraising networks in the US, and the Los Angeles chapter has teamed up with local partners in the hopes of developing longer-term recovery efforts. In the meantime, their Wildfire Response fund will address urgent needs, particularly for low-income individuals affected by the disaster. Donate here.",
