  "text": "It hasn't even been a full calendar year since Kerry King dropped his debut solo record, and the Slayer guitarist is already talking about recording another one. In an interview with Rolling Stone Brasil (transcribed by Blabbermouth), King discussed that whenever the album cycle for From Hell I Rise is finished, \"and right now that looks to [him] like October,\" he's planning on getting into the studio with Kerry King and Slayer drummer, Paul Bostaph. Bostaph \"and [King] have always talked about going straight from playing live, taking maybe a week off and go right into the studio to keep your tour chops, so you're firing on all cylinders – you don't gotta practice to get good; you're already good – and get in there and record it,\" King elaborated. Even more so, King explains that \"ideally, in [his] perfect world, it would be done this year and then just hand it to the record company and say, 'Put it in line, whenever you want it to come out.'\" When hypothesising about what may be on the second Kerry King solo record, his thought is to \"make an extension from what From Hell I Rise is, just keep doing [things the same way], see what the next 10 or 12 [songs] sound like.\" Additionally, King is hoping that From Hell I Rise producer, Josh Wilbur, will be able to join his endeavours in a second solo record: \"He was very hands-on, [a] very cool guy. I loved working with him… So, we're hoping the windows line up to where we're both free.\" King accredits Wilbur as \"member number six\" of Kerry King, and that his brain was able to think of things King couldn't during the writing process of the debut record. Currently, Kerry King consists of Kerry King (Slayer) and Phil Demmel (Machine Head) on guitars, Mark Osegueda (DEATH ANGEL) on vocals, bassist Kyle Sanders (HELLYEAH), and Paul Bostaph (Slayer). The band has a few select live dates coming up this summer, including appearances at Alcatraz Metal Festival and FEZEN Festival in Europe, and Bangers Open Air in Brazil in May. Want More Metal?
