  "text": "Music creation platform Splice has integrated its sample library with Avid’s Pro Tools digital audio workstation, making millions of loops, sound effects and one-shots available to the artists and producers who use the popular music-making tool.The idea is to speed up the music-making process by eliminating the need to switch between apps when adding samples to a music project.The new Pro Tools 2025.6 will allow subscribers to access around 2,500 samples for free, with the rest available through a monthly subscription fee. “Putting Splice directly into the creative workflow is core to our mission,” Splice SVP of Content Kenny Ochoa said in a statement on Wednesday (June 18).“This integration makes it easier than ever for Pro Tools users to access our AI-powered discovery and world-class sound library – right where they’re making music.”“This integration makes it easier than ever for Pro Tools users to access our AI-powered discovery and world-class sound library – right where they’re making music.”Kenny Ochoa, SplicePro Tools users will be able to drag audio clips from the Pro Tools timeline into Splice’s AI-powered ‘Search with Sound’ panel to match samples by rhythm, key and tempo, Avid said, eliminating the need to switch between apps and manually import Splice samples into Pro Tools. Users will then be able to drag the sample back into their session.“Whether producers and artists are sketching out ideas, building out tracks, or applying final touches, Pro Tools’ Splice integration provides a more powerful environment for creating music – giving users the ability to quickly find the perfect sound while staying in their creative flow,” said Kenna Hilburn, SVP, Product at Avid. The new Pro Tools version also rolls out a new AI-powered speech-to-text tool that allows editors to search audio files in a session for speech and lyric information. The tool displays text alongside the relevant clip, speeding up the navigation process.“The reaction from both the postproduction and music communities has been incredibly positive,” Hilburn said. “Speech-to-text is a major step forward, simplifying ADR, editing, and dialogue workflows.”“Whether producers and artists are sketching out ideas, building out tracks, or applying final touches, Pro Tools’ Splice integration provides a more powerful environment for creating music.”Kenna Hilburn, AvidMBW understands that the Splice integration and other new features in the latest Pro Tools version were powered by R\u0026D made possible in part by the capital injection that Avid got from its $1.4-billion all-cash acquisition by private equity firm Symphony Technology Group (STG) in 2023.Founded in 1987, Avid is one of the most prominent names in video and audio editing technology. On its “about” page, the company boasts that Avid DAW users scooped up numerous awards at the 2024 Grammys, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Immersive Audio Album. For Splice, the Pro Tools integration comes a few months after it acquired virtual instrument library Spitfire Audio in what the Financial Times described as a $50 million deal. The deal marked Splice’s entry into the music plugin market.Splice was valued at nearly $500 million in 2021, following a $55 million investment round led by Goldman Sachs, and the company has been busy rolling out new features in recent years, including Splice Mic, introduced earlier this year on its mobile app, which allows users to record vocals over instrumentals made in the app.Since 2022, various versions of Splice’s mobile app have featured a AI-powered tools that enable creators to browse, audition, and craft music directly from their phones.The company recently said it hit nearly 350 million downloads of its sample packs in 2024.Music Business Worldwide",
