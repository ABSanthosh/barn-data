  "text": "JD Vance was loudly booed at the Kennedy Center while attending a concert on Thursday night. The vice president was jeered after being spotted by members of the audience as he took his seat for a performance of Stravinsky’s Petrushka by the National Symphony Orchestra and Greek violinist Leonidas Kavakos. Watch video of the moment below. As revealed last week, more than 20 performances at the Kennedy Center have been canceled or postponed since Donald Trump installed himself as chairman, fired several members of the board, and promised a new “Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.” Among the impacted events includes a staging of Hamilton, whose producers said they “cannot presently support” the institution.
