  "text": "For night five of Tyler's Chromakopia Tour, the 33-year-old gave LA an unforgettable experience. Tyler, The Creator performs on Chromakopia: The World Tour at Los Angeles' Crypto.com Arena on Feb. 14, 2025. Shaun Llewellyn It’s incredible to think about the evolution of Tyler, The Creator’s music. From the days of Odd Future in Fairfax, where his music felt like controlled chaos, to now—headlining arenas, selling out shows, and having a Billboard No. 1 album. Despite his success, Tyler remains the same person from Los Angeles, CA. His return to his beloved city for the Chromakopia Tour was a nostalgic and fun-filled experience. The Chromakopia Tour is like a love letter to everything Tyler has built, combining old and new, chaos and control, humor and real emotion. The crowd at Crypto Arena for his six-day run was lit up in green, pulling fans into the Chromakopia world before the show started. And when Tyler finally hit the stage, it wasn’t all about the music—it was about the moments in between. The weird ones, the nostalgic ones, the ones that had everyone looking at each other like, are we really all barking right now? That’s the magic of a Tyler show. You go in thinking you’re just there to hear some great music, but you leave feeling like you were part of something bigger, something that only you, as a fan, can experience at a Tyler, The Creator show. Whether he was eating a donut mid-verse or teasing songs with a vinyl player, every detail felt thoughtful. Here are the eight best moments from night five of Tyler, The Creator’s LA run. Making It Rain: Tyler Threw Cash into the Crowd During “STICKY” A lot of artists throw water into the crowd. Tyler throws actual cash. During “STICKY,” out of nowhere, he started making it rain on the audience, and people went feral. One girl caught a bill, turned to her friend, and yelled, “We’re splitting this in half!” before jumping up and down like they had just won the lottery. It wasn’t about the money — the controlled chaos and joy from everyone around made it perfect. Donuts and Debauchery: Eating Mid-Performance During “Yonkers” This was the peak of Tyler’s behavior. Midway through “Yonkers,” instead of just delivering one of his most legendary verses like usual, he pulled out a donut and casually started eating it while rapping, as if he wasn’t performing in front of thousands of people. No explanation, no setup — just munch and rap. It seemed like a nod to the Odd Future days when everything he did seemed like a mix of instinct and calculated nonsense.  Bark If You Hear Me: The Crowd Went Full Dog Mode Tyler’s fans don’t just listen — they commit. Tyler barked into the mic multiple times throughout the show, and without hesitation, the entire arena barked back. Thousands of people. Barking. Tyler stood there a few times, baffled, like, “What had I created?” But the best part? It kept happening. Every time he barked, the crowd doubled down, turning the entire arena into one big bark fest. Setting the Vibe: The Incense Ritual Before “EARFQUAKE” Before “EARFQUAKE,” Tyler lit an incense stick on stage. It was a small moment, but it instantly shifted the room’s energy. The crowd sang along, and Tyler didn’t have to do too much. That’s what makes a Tyler show different. One minute, you’re barking like a dog. The next, you’re deep in your feelings, singing along to a song that somehow hits harder live than it ever did through headphones. A Love Letter to LA: Performing “THAT GUY” for His Hometown This moment felt made for LA. Tyler performed “THAT GUY,” his remix of Kendrick Lamar’s “Hey Now,” and the entire arena went off. With both Tyler and Kendrick being LA staples, his performance of that song was something bigger than just another song on the setlist. Some moments feel like they could happen at any stop on the tour. This wasn’t one of them. Old School Flex: Teasing Songs with a Vinyl Player Instead of just announcing the next song, Tyler made it an experience. He had a vinyl player on stage, and before each track, he’d pick up a record, examine it for a second, then place it on the turntable. A few seconds later, the beat would drop, and the crowd would lose it. The show is made to feel less like a pre-planned concert and more like a live, in-the-moment mixtape. The Coolest Living Room Ever: The Most Creative Stage Design of the Tour The stage isn’t your typical arena setup — there is a part that looks more like a cluttered, lived-in space full of vinyl records, furniture, and random objects. At times, during the living room part of the show, it felt like we weren’t in a massive venue at all, but instead, watching Tyler vibe out in his own space and playing whatever music he felt like he was in the mood for. Welcome to Chromakopia: The Entire Arena Glowed Green Before the music started, Crypto Arena was glowing green—not just the stage but the entire building. It was like stepping inside the Chromakopia world like the album isn’t just being performed—it’s being lived in. Every detail, from the lighting to the set design, made the experience feel immersive in a way that most arena shows never quite manage to pull off. Tyler continues to remind everyone why he’s one of the most creative, unpredictable, and flat-out entertaining artists of our time. The Chromakopia Tour is funny, intimate, and nostalgic —the perfect balance of thoughtful artistry.  Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
