  "text": "Alien Ant Farm frontman Dryden Mitchell alleges that CKY singer Chad I Ginsburg punched him in the face during the two bands’ co-headlining UK/European tour. As a result, Alien Ant Farm are finishing the rest of the tour without CKY. Mitchell recounted the events the led up to the alleged altercation in a post to social media on Saturday. As he tells it, Ginsburg was abusive to “multiple crew members and opening band members.” Mitchell said he eventually confronted Ginsburg, which led him to flipping over a table in the dressing room and throwing his phone. Mitchell subsequently met with CKY’s manager, which is when Ginsburg apparently punched him in the face. “I would love these shows to continue and apologize to all the CKY fans for Chad’s behavior,” Mitchell stated. “We have zero hard feelings for Jess [Margera] and Elvis [James] in CKY and are gutted to see them go, but I will never knowingly put myself in volatile situations so this had to end.” Alien Ant Farm is offering refunds to CKY fans who don’t wish to attend the upcoming concerts in the band’s absence.",
