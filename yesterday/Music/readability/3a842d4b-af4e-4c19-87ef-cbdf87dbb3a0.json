  "text": "Ozzy Osbourne is taking every measure to give “120 percent” at the upcoming July 5th concert marking his final Black Sabbath and solo performances. So much so, that he’s having his “blood pressure taken 15 times a day. The Prince of Darkness will perform a solo set, followed by a Black Sabbath set to close out the historic “Back to the Beginning” show in his hometown of Birmingham, England. The all-star bill also features Metallica, Guns N’ Roses, Tool, Slayer, Pantera, Gojira, and many more notable rock and metal acts. In a new edition of “Ozzy Speaks” program on his Ozzy’s Boneyard SiriusXM channel, the metal legend spoke about his preparation for his final gig. “I have got this trainer guy who helps people get back to normal,” he said. “It’s hard going, but he’s convinced that he can pull it off for me. I’m giving it everything I’ve got.” He continued, “It’s endurance. The first thing that goes when you’re laid up is your stamina. … I am having my blood pressure taken 15 times a day. I’ve got this fucking device on my finger. It’s a monitor to say how my heart rate is.’” While he’s doing everything he can to physically prepare for the show after several years of health setbacks, including an ongoing battle with Parkinson’s disease, Ozzy said he has to overcome some mental hurdles, as well. ‘My head’s crazy. ADHD – I have that badly,” explained the singer. “I will have done the show and died a death before I even started my exercises. So I try and put it on the back burner. I’m not going up there saying, ‘It’s going to be great. I’m really confident.’ In my head I will have died on my ass.” He concluded, “But all I can say is I’m giving 120 percent. If my God wants me to do the show, I’ll do it.”",
