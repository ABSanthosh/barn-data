Adele performs during her final Las Vegas residency show, \"Weekends with Adele,\" at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace on Nov. 23, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Denise Truscello/Getty Images for AD Adele bid an emotional farewell to the Las Vegas stage she’s performed on since November 2022, which is when her two-year residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace began. “I don’t know when I’m next going to perform again,” she said to her final “Weekends With Adele” audience on Saturday night (Nov. 23), telling fans, “I will miss it terribly, and I will miss you terribly.” “I’m not doing anything else,” she added, as seen in a fan-captured clip from the concert. “I’m actually s—ing myself about what I am going to do. I don’t have any f—ing plans.” During her speech on Saturday, Adele joked, “I chose to do a residency mainly because I f—ing hate touring,” and then with tears in her eyes told the crowd she committed to Vegas to keep a stable schedule for her son: “I chose to do a residency so I could keep his life normal, and I did do that.” Trending on Billboard The “Weekends With Adele” residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace ran from November 2022 to November 2024, with two performances each weekend on her schedule.“I am emotional, but just so you know, I got closure when Celine Dion came to my show,” she assured the audience, announcing she “cried for a whole week” after the experience. “It was just such a full-circle moment for me. Because that’s the only reason I ever wanted to be in here.” Dion — who opened The Colosseum with her first residency in 2003 — attended Adele’s Oct. 26 show with her sons. Adele, spotting the pop legend in the crowd, was brought to tears in the middle of “When We Were Young” and later wrote on social media that The Colosseum “was the only venue I wanted to play in Vegas because it was built for her. I have a picture of her right next to the stage that I touch every night before I walk on and she came to the show this weekend and it was a surprise and it was a MOMENT!!” Previously, the “Easy on Me” singer said she needs rest when her residency’s over — and that she plans to temporarily step away from music. Adele shared that she wants to take “a big break after this, and I think I want to do other creative things, just for a little while.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
