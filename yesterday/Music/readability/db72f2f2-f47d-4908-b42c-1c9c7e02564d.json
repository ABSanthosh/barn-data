  "text": "Sleep Token has been playing the long game with teasing their new material. It all really began on February 18 when Sleep Token unveiled a mysterious new website where you had to dig into the course code to unveil its true meaning. Then later that same month, there were Sleep Token-affiliated Instagram accounts named House Veridian and Feathered Host sending fans sheet music of new music. As fans speculate that new music from Sleep Token will arrive on Friday, March 14 (alongside a date-less pre-save link), a second component has surfaced – either a US or North American tour. Several major venues across the United States have changed their profile picture to the House Veridian and Feathered Host art, indicating that a tour is likely being announced very soon. Those venues are: DCU Center – Worchester, MAGAS South District – Atlanta, GAPinnacle Bank Arena – Lincoln, NETacoma Dome – Tacoma, WAMaverik Center – West Valley City, UTRocket Arena – Cleveland, OH If I had to guess, this tour is probably happening this September and October considering that's when Sleep Token will be in the country for Louder Than Life 2025.
