  "text": "Murdered in Tijuana at just 23 years old, the late artist's LP No Fue Suerte will be released on Street Mob Records. This is how the project came together. Chuy Montana Street Mob Records Español Chuy Montana’s story began at the border — but his voice carried far beyond its lines. Found busking with his guitar for traffic-bound listeners at the Tijuana-San Ysidro crossing, Jesús Cárdenas (real name) was discovered by JOP of Fuerza Regida, whose belief in Chuy’s talent led to him signing the young artist to Street Mob Records in 2023. It was a moment that would propel Montana into the booming international Mexican music scene. But on February 7, 2024, just as his music was beginning to flourish, Chuy Montana was found murdered in Tijuana. He was only 23 years old. Now, nearly a year and a half later, his voice emerges again. On Thursday (June 26) night, Street Mob Records releases Montana’s posthumous debut album: No Fue Suerte, an 11-track collection featuring collaborations with some of the most buzzworthy names in regional Mexican music today, including Fuerza Regida, as well as Calle 24, Clave Especial, Armenta and more. With the help of Street Mob, the project was completed in close collaboration with Montana’s family. Trending on Billboard “This has been the most [unique] type of project I’ve ever worked — the most challenging, but also the most rewarding,” Cindy Gaxiola, VP of commercial affairs at Street Mob Records, tells Billboard Español. “When you’re sitting there playing music for Chuy’s mom, and she’s taking it in and expressing her emotions — that was definitely a learning process for me, in a very positive way. So it’s rewarding to know that all of those emotions, all of that work, finally gets to be heard.” The project features never-before-heard recordings that showcase the full breadth of Chuy Montana’s artistry: from corridos bélicos that confront life’s raw truths (“No Fue Suerte”), tender ballads steeped in emotional honesty (“Mamá”), and pensive tracks that showcase the creativity of a young artist finding his voice (“Qué Será”). The album represents a community effort, largely featuring artists within the Street Mob Records roster, all of whom shared close ties with Montana. Most of the collabs were recorded over the artist’s voice after his death. Two songs feature collaborations with hitmakers Fuerza Regida. “JOP was very involved in the creative process,” Gaxiola says. “He wanted to know where the album stood and get everything as close as possible [to finished]. He decided to jump on ‘Fama’ with Güero X, but as we continued mixing, mastering, and finalizing, he said, ‘You know what? I want to jump on another song.’ That’s how he ended up joining ‘Sin Chingarme a Nadie.’” Chuy Montana Street Mob Records Montana’s friendship with Güero X helped to shape the album’s direction and ensure Chuy’s voice was centered, mentions Gaxiola. “Güero was the one that also took a really good lead on this project, in terms of helping us gather the music and a bridge between us and the family since the beginning,” she adds. “Calle 24 was already on one of the songs because they were friends,” she explains. “When it came to Clave Especial, who’s at such an exciting point in their career, their response was immediate: ‘Of course, what an honor for us to be a part of it.’” Both Calle and Clave are featured on track “Cuadros Peruanos.” Other collaborators, like songwriter Armenta, joined at the request of Montana’s family for the steel-string guitar-laden “De Tijuana a París.” “Armenta asked if he could change some of the lyrics,” Gaxiola recalls. “And the family gave him their blessing because they wanted his voice and his touch to shine on the track. Everything about this project was very organic.” At the heart of the album lies Montana’s ability to transport listeners into emotional, often visual worlds. His lyrics blend confessional candor with poetic imagery — a talent that stands out most on the album’s eerily foreshadowing focus track, “Perdón Mamá.” Featuring Juanpa Salazar and menacing accordion riffs, the song opens with the chilling lines: “Perdón, mamá, no fui lo que quisiste/ Yo se que ahorita tú te encuentras triste/ Mi cuerpo ahí estaba tirado, el charco rojo, empapados” (“Forgive me, mom, I wasn’t what you wanted/ I know that right now you’re feeling sad/ My body was lying there, the red puddle, soaked”). “When you listen to the album, you can visualize everything that he’s singing,” Gaxiola says. “That’s what makes listening to it so hard — yet it shows just how great of a storyteller he was. Even though he hadn’t lived some of these stories, you could feel how much he understood them.” “Every note, every word on this album carries Chuy’s spirit,” shares a family member in a press release. For Montana’s relatives, the album’s completion offered not just a chance to celebrate his work, but also a moment of healing. Street Mob Records also honored the family’s grief by organizing a private trip in Mexico‘s Caribbean coast where 16 relatives gathered to hear the finished product for the first time. “They all had Chuy’s merch, were wearing it that night,” Gaxiola says. The trip created a space for connection and reflection. “This project wasn’t just about music — it brought people together, from the artists to our team and his family.” For fans, Montana’s debut album offers the bittersweet promise of what could have been — a glimpse into a rising star whose stories resonate even beyond his years. “I hope fans listen to it with an open heart,” Gaxiola adds. “We’re all just excited for everyone to give this album the time and respect [it deserves], and for Chuy’s legacy to continue to live on.” Chuy Montanta’s No Fue Suere pre-save link is available here.
