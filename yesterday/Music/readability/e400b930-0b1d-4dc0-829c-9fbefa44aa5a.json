  "text": "Editor's Note: EDM.com proudly publishes four installments of annual year-end coverage: Industry Leaders, Performances \u0026 DJ Sets, Music Producers and Songs.DJing and music production are different. But the difference between the two is like a wallflower—it hides in plain sight, and it's vastly misunderstood.Publishing a \"Top DJ\" list would undermine the originality, creativity and unbridled imagination of the artists who dedicate their lives to music production. To honor their profound commitment to the art, the EDM.com staff annually recognizes 10 of the year's best.In no particular order, discover the best electronic music producers of 2024 below.ISOKNOCKArmed with generational production skills and an unapologetic disregard for convention, ISOxo and Knock2 proved in 2024 that some artistic combinations are simply written in the stars.Through reconstruction by deconstruction, their deliberately provocative artistry cut through the formulaic noise of today's EDM with both industrial precision and visceral intimacy. In a year marred by TikTok-fueled predictability, they smashed the playbook with nail-spiked baseball bats and brought anarchy to the algorithm, proving that unfiltered creativity still has a place in today's fractured streaming sector.The duo, collectively known as ISOKNOCK, shocked fans back in August when they surprise-released their debut album, 4EVR. Equal parts beautiful and belligerent, the project is a song-cycle of raw dance bangers that lock horns with punk's snarling spirit. One of the year's best albums, it's an experience that left us feeling like we'd been through some kind of metaphysical car wash—battered and soaked in sound, but somehow cleaner for the experience.ISOKNOCK's music also translated like clockwork to their 2024 live shows, which transformed dancefloors into middle-fingers-in-the-air battlegrounds that demanded physical and emotional surrender. The duo debuted at Coachella, demolishing the festival's legendary Sahara Tent before daring gravity at Chicago's North Coast Music Festival by performing in a shipping container suspended by a crane.Words by Jason Heffler.Knock2 (L) and ISOxo (R) of ISOKNOCK.Miranda Nicusanti/EDM.comPAWSAThere's a running joke in the house music scene that PAWSA's USB is like a genie's lamp—every track feels like a wish granted. The UK producer is notorious for teasing fans with unreleased music in his live sets for years before officially releasing it.In 2024, however, a number of PAWSA's hotly anticipated tracks hit the airwaves. The common thread between his releases—like \"DIRTY CASH (MONEY TALKS)\" and \"TOO COOL TO BE CARELESS\"—is a hedonistic mix of old-school dance music and modern tech house. He effortlessly blends timeless '90s vocals with thumping drums and basslines.Less is more for the minimal house virtuoso, and that's the best part. His stripped-back style eschews intricate melodies and busy, over-produced beats in favor of raw grooves. It's not just music you hear, but music your body feels—a direct line to the pulse of the dancefloor.Words by Saad Masood.Martin GarrixIn a banner year for electronic dance music, Martin Garrix reminded us that the future of the genre belongs to those bold enough to reimagine it. As it rapidly evolved throughout 2024, he remained a lighthouse—brilliant, influential and perpetually in motion.Garrix's music has always managed to engineer ageless memories in the minds of his fans, but this year, he returned to his progressive house roots and fired up the nostalgia machine more than ever. He was a force of nature, proving that sometimes the most groundbreaking moments come from rekindling the spark that first lit the fire.Every week it seemed like fans had a vintage Garrix banger to look forward to, born from his ability to weave his roots into a new and electrifying vision. He started with the unforgettable \"Carry You,\" an anthem of hope released in February alongside Third Party, Oaks and Declan J Donovan. Then came three consecutive singles in as many weeks, a succession that culminated in the release of IDEM, a rapturous EP featuring larger-than-life collaborations with DubVision, Mesto and more.The euphoria then bubbled over this summer when Garrix released \"Wherever You Are,\" a soaring festival favorite showcasing both his technical mastery and lyrical depth. But it might not end there—after Coldplay featured his song \"Breakaway\" in their viral Glastonbury set, he hinted that an original collaboration with the iconic band could come in 2025.Words by Jason Heffler.Martin Garrix.Louis van BaarJamie xx2024 brought the revival of the inimitable Jamie xx, whose release of In Waves—his first studio album in nearly a decade—led to one of the year's most compelling electronic music projects.It was worth the wait. In a year where songs were churned out faster than a ChatGPT prompt, In Waves stands as a testament to taking your time in the pursuit of a bold creative vision. It's sometimes joyful and sometimes hauntingly introspective. A project covering such a range risks feeling cluttered or disjointed, but not in the skilled hands of this English beatsmith.A raw love letter to club culture, In Waves told an exhilarating narrative through unforgettable tracks like \"Baddy on the Floor\" (with Honey Dijon), \"All You Children\" (with The Avalanches) and \"Waited All Night,\" the lattermost of which Jamie produced alongside his former bandmates from The xx, Oliver and Romy. By design, it's difficult to box these diverse tracks into a single genre classification.Jamie's music also left quite a cultural footprint in 2024. Before he even released In Waves, he returned to his home of London to host a curated event, \"The Floor,\" and manifested his dream of opening his very own club. It was a snapshot not only of his boundless creativity, but also his deep-rooted appreciation of the UK underground.Words by Rachel Freeman and Shakiel Mahjouri.LP GiobbiLP Giobbi has built her career on a foundation of innovation and empowerment, but she took them to new heights in 2024.Her infectious energy and genre-defying sound crept into the bedrock of Dotr, her hotly anticipated sophomore album. The record stands as a tour de force, blending her signature piano-driven house beats with soulful contributions from a compelling roster of collaborators, including Alabama Shakes, Portugal. The Man, Panama, Jacob Banks and Holly Bowling. Tracks like \"Feel\" and \"Bittersweet\" became instant hits, encapsulating Giobbi's unparalleled ability to bridge the gap between classical musicianship and modern dance music.She also remained steadfast in her commitment to fostering inclusivity in the electronic dance music community through her beloved FEMME HOUSE community, organizing workshops, mentorship and resources to combat industry disparities. The organization in March teamed up with Insomniac Records to release a massive compilation featuring music by Mary Droppinz, Lisbona Sisters, ZOF, Bexxie and other promising women in dance music.Words by Mikala Lugen.Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesPretty LightsPretty Lights' comeback demonstrated that true innovation takes time, introspection and a fearless leap into the unknown.Dual Fusion Unity, his first new original music in seven years, humbly reminded fans why he remains one of a kind. The radiant EP is vintage Pretty Lights, a kaleidoscopic journey through glitchy electronic textures, soulful vocal samples, funky brass flourishes and moments of pure analog warmth.On its opening track, \"Road to the Stars,\" Pretty Lights' reflective monologue serves as a poignant emblem of his extraordinary journey, crystallizing the return of a beloved artist seemingly at peace with creating art for its own sake. \"I'll fly a starship across the universe… and I'll be back again,\" he crooned.Touring once again with a live band, Pretty Lights picked up where he left off, elevating his live compositions into something even more dynamic by fusing raw instrumentation into his performances. In a genre often seen as saturated with pre-programmed sets, his music once again stood out as deeply human.Words by Cameron Sunkel.John SummitJust when you think John Summit can’t outdo himself, he does. If 2023 was his crescendo, 2024 was his symphony.He sold out massive arenas, like New York City's Madison Square Garden and LA's Kia Forum; performed at the world's biggest festivals, like Tomorrowland and Coachella; and curated bespoke events for his Experts Only imprint, including a ski trip in Colorado and a luminous Lake Tahoe mountain party.2024 was the year Summit unveiled his debut album, Comfort In Chaos, an anthemic yet intimate masterstroke in which he took his songwriting to new heights. His HAYLA-assisted festival anthems \"Where You Are\" and \"Shiver\" remained staples, but he also took risks, wading into the waters of drum \u0026 bass (\"palm of my hands\" with venbee), breakbeat (\"Stay With Me\" with Of The Trees) and techno (\"Resonate\" with Kaskade and Julia Church).However, he didn't stop at Comfort In Chaos. He emerged as a Renaissance man, one day remixing The Temper Trap, the next Green Velvet. He even dropped one of the year's best dubstep tracks alongside Subtronics and Tape B.2024 wasn't just another chapter for John Summit—it was the year he rewrote the rulebook on what an electronic music artist can achieve.Words by Saad Masood.John Summit.c/o AEG PresentsSara LandryThere are many, many reasons why Sara Landry holds the nickname \"High Priestess of Hard Techno.\"But the most convincing one—even in a year that saw her etch her name in Tomorrowland's history book as the first hard techno DJ to play its storied Mainstage—was Spiritual Driveby. Posing life's greatest questions at blistering BPMs, Landry's remarkable debut album effectively crystallized one of the most explosive electronic music breakouts in recent memory.Just like her ferocious DJ sets, the EDM.com Class of 2024 superstar dragged us into a vortex of brutal euphoria with her uncompromising approach to techno production. Teetering on the edge of avant-garde and vocal-driven techno, the 12-track opus saw her team up with a compelling group of collaborators, like Nico Moreno, Shlømo and the illustrious Mike Dean. The album even features a haunting soliloquy from her personal hypnotist.Landry soared to new heights and emerged as one of the most in-demand names in music, incinerating dancefloors and cementing herself as the undeniable \"It Girl\" of techno in 2024. And as she weaponizes her arsenal for her Coachella debut next year, all we can do is hold on for dear life.Words by Mikala Lugen and Jason Heffler.Sara Landry.c/o PressJusticeFrom the opening bars of Hyperdrama, Justice's first new album in eight years, the duo reminded us why we fell in love with their timeless electro in the first place.While it's still anchored in the gritty analog tones that made them icons, the album found Xavier de Rosnay and Gaspard Augé exploring uncharted territory with a renewed sense of adventure and emotional depth. They transcended the simple pleasures of body music to speak to the tragedies, triumphs and bittersweet complexities that loom over the dancefloor's euphoric release.Eschewing the aloof electronic stoicism that defined Justice's earlier works, Hyperdrama bleeds candor and restless yearning without abandoning their roots. Tracks like \"Generator\" and \"Neverender\" (with Tame Impala) have already earned their place as modern dance classics, reinforcing Augé and de Rosnay's ageless knack for crafting generational music.But it’s not just the music that made Hyperdrama stand out. They are said to have spent months working with a team of computer scientists to produce the album's accompanying live show, ultimately elevating it into a groundbreaking, multi-sensory experience that captivated crowds at Coachella and the Hollywood Bowl, among many others.Words by Jason Heffler and Rachel Freeman.LSZEEGood luck finding a more unique, yet refined, electronic album this year than LSZEE's self-titled debut.Fusing CloZee's globe-spanning sound with LSDREAM's spiritual funk and bass, the album is a transformative experience. There exists no collaborative partnership in the electronic music scene quite like this one; LSZEE sounds distinctly like LSZEE.The album's songs cover a lot of ground sonically, but flow seamlessly together with an overarching sense of wonder. Pay special attention to \"NIGHTHAWK,\" an absolute showstopper at the duo's live sets throughout the year.LSZEE are now embarking on what they claim to be their only tour in 2025. Do yourself a favor and see them before it's too late.Words by Shakiel Mahjouri.CloZee (L) and LSDREAM (R) of LSZEE.Harold England/ShutterKlickHonorable Mentions:RezzPeggy GouOdd MobCoco \u0026 BreezySyzyJon CaseyEpticTSHAlongstoryshortSammy Virji",
