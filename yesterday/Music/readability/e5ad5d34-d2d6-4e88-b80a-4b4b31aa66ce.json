  "text": "After more than five years without a new full-length, Testament have wrapped up their next studio offering — and they’re not stopping there. Guitarist Eric Peterson shared an update in a new episode of The Mixtape podcast, confirming the album is now mixed and nearly ready for release. Jens Bogren — whose resume includes work with Opeth, Kreator, Paradise Lost, Soilwork, and Amon Amarth — was behind the console. “We just finished mixing last Friday, and we're gonna be mastering it this week. [We're] in the middle of okaying art for the album. Everything needs to be turned in before we leave [for our tour of] Australia,” Peterson explained (via Blabbermouth). “A busy week coming up, but I'm excited because it's all done. We're just putting it all together, getting ready to send it in to the label, and then, yeah, it's gonna be coming out in the fall. And it came out really good. Jens Bogren mixed it, and I'm really, really happy with it.” This record will be the follow-up to Titans Of Creation (2020), which was co-produced by Juan Urteaga, known for his previous work with Testament on Dark Roots Of Earth (2012) and Brotherhood Of The Snake (2016). When asked how he stays motivated to keep writing and recording after decades in the game, Peterson offered a grounded answer. “It's a good question. Obviously, we've slowed down as far as the timing on how we put records out. [There's] a lot more going on in our lives. We tour a lot more places. New blood in the band, I think. So this time around, [Testament drummer] Chris [Dovas] is with us. But, yeah, it feels good right now. Everybody's happy. We get on really well. That's a good thing, especially in the writing area.” Even more surprising is that the band is already thinking beyond this album. “So I foresee some really good couple of new Testament records coming out — this one, and we're already working on the new one, which is unheard of for us. Usually, we start writing a couple of years after we put out a record, but we've kept the writing going. It's just a lot of fun jamming.” As for how their creative approach has evolved, Peterson credits the current chemistry within the lineup and an awareness that time waits for no one. “Yeah, so like I was saying, just with this new lineup — it's not a new lineup, but we have a new drummer — it all starts with me, with riffs, and a drummer, I think. And it was just a lot of fun. And we're already working on new stuff for a record after the one that you haven't even heard yet. So it's cool.” He adds, “And then we know if there's downtime, we're, like, 'Let's jam.' So I think when we're done in '26, maybe early '27 with this record, [we'll be, like], 'Okay, now what do you got? Now we're gonna write again.' 'Cause we're getting older. I don't think we have enough time to wait five years. We'll be in our seventies or something. I'm trying to take advantage of knowing that I'm into it now and that we've got a got a good thing going. Just don't waste it.” Want More Metal? Subscribe To Our Daily NewsletterEnter your information below to get a daily update with all of our headlines and receive The Orchard Metal newsletter.",
