  "text": "Dion Brant, the CEO of AEG Presents’ Australian concert promoter Frontier Touring, has been appointed President and CEO of AEG Presents Asia Pacific, effective immediately.Brant will continue in his role as chief executive at Frontier Touring, and will retain his seat on the company’s Board of Directors working out of Melbourne, AEG said in a statement on Tuesday (July 8).In his new roles, Brant will report to Adam Wilkes, President and CEO of AEG Presents Europe and Asia Pacific. He will spearhead AEG Presents’ ongoing growth and development in Asia, working to further strengthen the company’s footprint and strategic direction. Brant’s involvement with Frontier Touring began in 2013, when he was recruited by the Mushroom Group to head strategy and development across the company. He moved full-time to Frontier Touring a year later.He worked closely with Mushroom Group and Frontier co-founder Michael Gudinski, and was a key player in negotiating Frontier’s joint venture with AEG Presents in 2019.Brant took on the CEO role at Frontier following Gudinski’s untimely passing in 2021, after which AEG Presents took a controlling stake in the company. “Dion is a highly respected executive who has played an integral role in our success,” Wilkes said in a statement.“His leadership at Frontier has been transformational, proving he’s a steady hand capable of guiding our business into the future. I couldn’t be happier to name Dion to this position.”“[Dion’s] leadership at Frontier has been transformational.”Adam Wilkes, AEG PresentsBrant added: “I’ve worked closely with Adam for over a decade and have first-hand knowledge of the exceptional team he has built in AEG Presents’ Asia Pacific operations. And of course, our incredibly talented group at Frontier gives me the ability to split my time and take on this extra responsibility with the confidence that we’ll continue to lead the Australia and New Zealand markets.“I look forward to getting involved and helping to maintain positive momentum from what has been a successful period under Adam’s leadership. This further opens opportunities for us to bring the Frontier Touring and Asia Pacific businesses closer together, sharing insights, building capabilities, and enhancing our offering for artists across the region.” Brant’s appointment comes in the wake of a spate of personnel changes at the top of AEG Presents, notably a restructuring in January under which Wilkes assumed responsibility for AEG Presents’ European and Asia-Pacific operations, while Alex Hill assumed leadership of all of AEG’s global real estate and venue operations outside of the US, in the new position of President and CEO, AEG International.Shortly thereafter, Andrew Klein was promoted to President of Global Partnerships. The company’s Global Touring division has also seen new faces at the top, with Angie Rho named Senior Vice President of the division last November, while Weston Herbert was named Vice President in January.“This further opens opportunities for us to bring the Frontier Touring and Asia Pacific businesses closer together.”Dion Brant, Frontier Touring, AEG PresentsIn March, AEG Presents promoted seven executives to Senior Vice President roles in the Global Partnerships division, namely Andrew Bersch, Holli Branam, Samantha Fernandez, Brianne Grimley, Bret Heiman, Eric Kohler, and Alex McArthur.Most recently, Andrew Spencer was named Chief Operating Officer at AEG Presents Europe, and Joe Jaeger was promoted to the role of AEG Presents’ Vice President, Integrated Marketing and Strategy.A division of Anschutz Entertainment Group, AEG Presents is the world’s second-largest live music and entertainment company, behind Live Nation.Music Business Worldwide",
