  "text": "Disturbed's pyrotechnics were a bit of a problem during their March 8 show at the United Center in Chicago, IL. According to a report from the Chicago Tribune, Disturbed's flames damaged the banners commemorating the Chicago Bulls' six NBA championships which will no longer be displayed for the rest of the season. The report further notes that all six banners suffered \"significant heat damage that warped their bottom halves.\" For all you sports fans out there, the banners commemorate the Chicago Bulls' winning NBA titles in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997 and 1998. No word on if Disturbed will be recruited to play for the team in order to win more titles. \"United Center is currently working with the Bulls to explore options to repair these banners,\" United Center communications said in a statement. \"While the banners will not be in place for the remainder of this season, we do anticipate them being back in place next season.\" Want More Metal?
