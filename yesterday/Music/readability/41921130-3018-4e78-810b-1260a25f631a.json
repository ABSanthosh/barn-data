  "text": "Patrick Walden, the London-born musician who served as former lead guitarist of Babyshambles, has died. He was 46 years old. Walden’s passing was announced in a social media post by Babyshambles, which read, “It is with deep regret and sadness that we share the news of Patrick Walden’s death. We feel very fortunate to have known/loved and worked with him and we kindly ask for respect and privacy during these difficult times.” No cause of death has been revealed at this time. Walden came up in the London scene and played in bands like The White Sport, Fluid, and the Six Cold Thousand before joining Babyshambles as a founding member in 2004, launching the project alongside The Libertines’ Pete Doherty. Together, the two co-wrote some of the groups most well-known songs, including the 2005 single “Fuck Forever” from their debut album, Down in Albion. In 2006, Walden left Babyshambles, but continued playing guitar as a session musician, recording with James Blunt, Whitey, The Honeymoon, and more. He would go on to reunite with Babyshambles members here and there, but never formally rejoined. In his final years, Walden faced several legal challenges and struggles with addiction, but continued to play music, working on various projects, including Big Dave and a recording project with former Rebecas member Robert Mannall.",
