  "text": "Former Comeback Kid bassist and vocalist Matt Keil – who played with the band from 2008 to 2014 – is sadly battling the incurable ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis). Keil was originally diagnosed in 2024 and his family has since launched a GoFundMe to help with the expenses around his disease. Donate to that here. \"Dear family, friends, and supporters, you may know Matt Keil as a loving husband of 12 years to Maddie, or as a dedicated father of Ellie (9) and Zoey (7). You may also know him as a successful realtor, impassioned musician, and member of the Twin Cities community. However Matt has been a part of your life, you know that he is one of the kindest, most generous, hilarious, and genuine people. Matt would love nothing more than to live the rest of his years spending time with his family, traveling to the lake in WI, golfing, making music with friends, cheering on his daughters at soccer and gymnastics, or watching silly movies with the love of his life. \"On May 2, 2024, Matt was diagnosed with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), a progressive \u0026 fatal neurological disease that causes muscle weakness, paralysis, and respiratory failure. Devastatingly, ALS has no cure. The aggressive progression of this disease within a year of diagnosis has hindered Matt's independence \u0026 altered his family's day-to-day lives. \"The costs of healthcare and medical accommodations that improve Matt's quality of life are tremendous. In her role as sole caretaker, Maddie has had to take an unpaid leave of absence from work. The Keil family have been hesitant to ask for help, and we are stepping in on their behalf. We are asking for support from loved ones and beyond to alleviate the financial burden that accompanies battling a fatal illness and to ensure ongoing support for Maddie and their girls. Your donations will go directly toward: In-home care Mobility aids Medical treatments \u0026 therapies Memorial costs An education fund for Ellie and Zoey \"Thank you for joining us in support of the Keil family and raising awareness for those living with ALS.\" Comeback Kid also commented: \"Our previous bass player Matt Keil was diagnosed with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), a progressive \u0026 fatal neurological disease that causes muscle weakness, paralysis, and respiratory failure. Devastatingly, ALS has no cure.
