  "text": "Mick Fleetwood and Lindsey Buckingham have reunited in the studio for the first time since Buckingham was fired from Fleetwood Mac in 2018. News of their collaboration comes from Swedish producer Carl Falk, who has posted photos of the two working on Fleetwood’s solo album. In late February, Falk posted a photo of Buckingham and Fleetwood in the studio on Threads with the caption, “Slightly unreal moment to sit with Lindsey Buckingham and Mick Fleetwood to play Lindsey the album we have been working on. And to see his genuine happiness for Mick to finally do his own album and offering to play guitar and to sing on it. Can’t wait to finish this one.” More recently, Falk posted a studio shot of Buckingham with the caption, “Mick and Lindsey together again, what a flawless guitar player.” He also shared a photo of Fleetwood in the studio with The War on Drugs. While Mick Fleetwood and Buckingham have remained friends even outside of the studio, don’t expect a full-fledged Fleetwood Mac reunion. Following the tragic death of Christine McVie in 2022, both Fleetwood and Stevie Nicks have said the band is over. There’s also the matter of Nicks and Buckingham’s strained relationship. In a 2024 interview, Nicks said “three minutes” was as long as she could stand talking to Buckingham during McVie’s celebration of life. “You could not say that I did not give him more than 300 million chances,” she said. Fleetwood’s most recent album was Blues Experience, a 2024 collaboration with Jake Shimabukuro. His last solo album, Something Big, was released in 2004.",
