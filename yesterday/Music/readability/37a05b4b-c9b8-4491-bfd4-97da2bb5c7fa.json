  "text": "Fresh off a Grammy sweep, the rapper dominates with three songs in the top five of this week's chart. Kendrick Lamar Dave Free Fresh off a Grammy sweep for “Not Like Us,” which won all five of its nominations, Kendrick Lamar piles on another win as his single “TV Off,” featuring Lefty Gunplay, darts to No. 1 on Billboard’s Rhythmic Airplay chart dated Feb. 8. The track jumps from No. 3 to crown the list after a 12% surge in plays that made it the most-played tune on U.S. panel-contributing monitored rhythmic radio stations in the tracking week of Jan. 24 – 30, according to Luminate. “TV Off” detaches Tyler, The Creator’s “Sticky,” featuring GloRilla, Sexyy Red and Lil Wayne, from the Rhythmic Airplay summit after the latter’s one week in charge. Last week’s champ drops to No. 2 after a 2% decline in plays for the week. Trending on Billboard With “TV Off,” Kendrick Lamar achieves his eighth Rhythmic Airplay No. 1 and second of 2025, after “Squabble Up” ruled for two weeks in January. Here’s the updated review of his chart-topping collection on the radio ranking: “Humble.,” three weeks at No. 1, beginning June 6, 2017“Loyalty.,” featuring Rihanna one, Sept. 30, 2017“Love.,” featuring Zacari, one, Dec. 30, 2017“Pray for Me,” with The Weeknd, two, April 18, 2018“Like That,” with Future and Metro Boomin, four, May 18, 2024“Not Like Us,” 12, June 15, 2024“Squabble Up,” two, Jan. 18, 2025“TV Off,” featuring Lefty Gunplay, one, Feb. 8, 2025 Featured artist Lefty Gunplay earns his first Rhythmic Airplay No. 1 through his maiden entry on the chart. The rapper is one of several California-bred rappers with supporting spots on GNX, Lamar’s 2024 album that includes “TV Off” and “Squabble Up.” Beyond the No. 1 title, Kendrick Lamar claims plenty more prime real estate on Rhythmic Airplay. The previous champ “Squabble Up” slides 2-3, while “Luther,” a collaboration with SZA, leaps 9-4 with a 12% improvement in plays. With the trio, Lamar is the first act — in a lead role — to have three of the top five concurrently on the Rhythmic Airplay chart. In total, five acts, including Lamar this week, have had three of the top five at the same time, but the other four – Ashanti, 50 Cent, T-Pain and Drake – all needed a combination of songs in both lead and featured billings. Moreover, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Lamar enjoys a fourth appearance in the week’s top 10 – for a second week in a row – with a different collaboration with SZA, “30 for 30,” which repeats at its No. 10 peak. A week ago, he became the fifth act to have four of the top 10 titles concurrently, and the first ever with four of the top 10 in a lead role. The only other acts to claim four of the top 10 at the same time are 50 Cent, T-Pain, Lil Wayne and Drake. While “TV Off,” “Squabble Up” and “Luther” all appear on Lamar’s GNX, “30 for 30” is from SZA’s SOS Deluxe: LANA edition of her chart-topping album. Elsewhere, “TV Off” holds at its No. 10 best on the Mainstream R\u0026B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart (up 3% in weekly plays) and slides 2-3 from its peak on Rap Airplay, though it added 7% in weekly audience listenership. On the all-genre Radio Songs chart, “TV Off” lands a third nonconsecutive week at its No. 30 high, with an 8% boost to 21 million audience impressions across all formats.
