  "text": "If you've ever wondered what Metallica's 1986 instrumental \"Orion\" would sound like if it was written by Limp Bizkit guitarist Wes Borland, here it is! Or at least a short snippet. It's pretty cool to see Borland take the melodies that we're all super familiar with as metal fans, and rework it as if it were a Limp Bizkit instrumental. Now the real question is when Limp Bizkit is gonna break out a whole ass \"Orion\" cover for a crowd and confuse everyone. I'd be down for it. \"Horsing around and loopidy loopin with 'Orion' by Metallica this afternoon,\" wrote Borland of the quick cover. \"Anybody coming out to any of the shows this summer?\" Speaking of Limp Bizkit has got some dates coming up with Metallica and Ice Nine Kills. There might also be new music – we'll see what happens.
