  "text": "\"I kind of had a feeling...,\" the star laughs of the answer she received. Julia Fox for MAC MAC Nearly a year after Julia Fox debuted her first single “Down the Drain” at Charli XCX’s February 2024 Boiler Room DJ set, the actress is thinking big when it comes to the future of her music career. In fact, Fox is setting her sights on the Billboard charts. While partnering with MAC for a new campaign, the Uncut Gems star asks a Magic 8 Ball for some guidance on her goals as a musician — but the answer might come as a disappointment to those who are fans of her burgeoning sound. “Will I be a Billboard [Hot] 100 artist?” Fox, sitting on a subway platform bench while dressed in a revealing nude dress and pale purple glam, asks the toy before giving it a shake. “My reply is no!” she quickly reports back, laughing. “I kind of had a feeling it was no.” Trending on Billboard The new video is part of MAC’s Eight Ball Questions series, which also includes new clips with Martha Stewart and Tiffany “New York” Pollard. While Fox’s 8 Ball might be counting her out, there’s no telling what the future might actually bring. After all, the model did enter the music game last year with the release of “Down the Drain,” produced by Ben Draghi and accompanied by an envelope-pushing music video filmed at a dominatrix dungeon where she used to work. “In all seriousness, music was my first love,” she told Rolling Stone of her musical ambitions in May. “I’ve always wanted to do it, but I got discouraged by [my] mom at a young age, so I’m just healing my childhood wounds and making my lifelong dreams come true. [I’m] not trying to get rich off music or win Grammys. I have realistic expectations.” Watch Fox consult her Magic 8 Ball below. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
