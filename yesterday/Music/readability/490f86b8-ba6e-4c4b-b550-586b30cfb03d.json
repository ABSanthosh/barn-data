A month after frontperson Ellery James Roberts dissolved his Lost Under Heaven project, the band that propelled him to indie-rock renown has announced three shows in its native Manchester, England, and festival dates in France and Belgium. No concrete details have been announced, but fans on Reddit report receiving postcards that point to the website containing the dates. And, today, an Instagram account attributed to the band’s L Y F Recordings label posted several teaser Stories and a photo carousel of billboards emblazoned with the slogan, “A new life is coming.”These will be WU LYF’s first shows in 13 years, following the tour that accompanied their only album to date, Go Tell Fire to the Mountain. The band split in late 2012, with Roberts declaring in a lengthy statement, “WU LYF is dead to me. The sincerity of ‘Go tell fire’ was lost in the bull shit of maintaining face in the world we live. Clap your hands chimp everybody’s watching.”WU LYF:04-17 Manchester, England - TBA04-18 Manchester, England - TBA04-19 Manchester, England - TBA05-25 Brussels, Belgium - Les Nuits Botanique07-19 Hyères, France - MIDI Festival",
