  "text": "The Ocean and guitarist David Ramis Åhfeldt have parted ways. According to a statement by Åhfeldt, he's leaving the band purely for personal reasons and that there's no bad blood between himself and The Ocean. Åhfeldt's final show with The Ocean will be at Hellfest on June 21. This also marks the second departure from The Ocean in 2025, the first being drummer Paul Seidel back in February. \"I've decided to step down from my position as guitarist of The Ocean,\" wrote Åhfeldt. \"The reasons are purely personal, and I want to be clear that there's absolutely no bad blood between any of us. I love the guys deeply and will always be grateful for the experiences we've shared over the years. \"Without getting too deep into it, I've come to realize that I'm no longer happy being involved in the band — and that's something I can't ignore. That said, these past years have been an incredible ride, and I'm thankful to have met so many of you along the way. Your support has meant the world to me. \"I'll be playing my final shows with the band soon, including an epic closing chapter show at @hellfestopenair . If you happen to be at any of the shows, please come and say hi — I'd love that. Much love to you all, David\" Want More Metal?
