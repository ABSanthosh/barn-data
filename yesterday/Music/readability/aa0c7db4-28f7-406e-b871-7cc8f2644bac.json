If not, please help provide 5 sample tracks per style for us to analyze and customize the style for you.”EasyOde’s Terms of Service stipulate that users must “acknowledge and agree that the User Content that you post and upload while using [Easy Ode’s Services are created by or legally licensed to you”.The platform also includes the following disclaimer: “We respect intellectual property rights and ask you to do the same”.It adds: “As a condition of your access to and use of the Services, you agree not to infringe intellectual property rights of any person while using the Services.”One of the most interesting elements of the EasyOde website, however, isn’t what it can do, but rather who at ByteDance it was potentially built by.In the bottom left-hand corner of the site showing the website’s site map, you’ll notice a reference to the copyright belonging to ByteDance’s SAMI team — a name you may recall reading in MBW’s extensive reporting on TikTok and ByteDance’s music-related activities.Last March, we published a pair of widely shared reports about ByteDance‘s ambitions in AI-generated music.In one of those articles, we told you about the extensive research in AI music conducted by ByteDance’s Speech, Audio \u0026 Music Intelligence (SAMI) team. As we told you last year, this team has become quite the global priority at ByteDance/TikTok.One of those research projects described a generative model called MeLoDy that was trained, according to ByteDance’s SAMI researchers, on 257,000 hours of music that came from 6.4 million audio files.We also told you about a batch of US patents and trademarks secured by ByteDance and its Lemon Inc. affiliate that provide IP protection in the US for the Chinese company’s AI music-related technologies.According to the EasyOde website, the platform is “owned by BytePlus”.BytePlus was launched by ByteDance in 2021– reportedly as a new division to sell its AI technology.ByteDance, via its Lemon Inc. affiliate, owns trademarks in the United States for ‘BytePlus‘ which appear to have been officially registered in May 2023.The trademark listed on the USPTO describes a “Platform as a Service (PaaS)” and covers what the filing states are “computer software platforms for generating and delivering personalized recommendations to customers in the fields of artificial intelligence, data mining, data analytics”.The trademark also covers “machine-learning based music generation, and machine language translation; software consultancy services relating to artificial intelligence, data mining, data analytics, and machine learning”.BytePlus is listed in ByteDance’s corporate structure diagram, which you can see below.We must emphasize here that we are by no means suggesting that any of the music available on EasyOde is AI-generated.The truth is, we don’t know if any of it is.According to EasyOde’s terms of service, “all music made available on the site is created or licensed by EasyOde”.The website also states that its library of 60,000 “rights-cleared” tracks, which it says includes “top-trending background music in popular short video apps”, features tracks “created by music producers, and music customized by studios”.Music Business Worldwide",
