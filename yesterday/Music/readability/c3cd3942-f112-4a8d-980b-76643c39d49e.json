  "text": "A little background for what you're about to read – Faith No More and Mr. Bungle canceled their September and October 2021 tour dates as vocalist Mike Patton dealt with ongoing mental health issues. Those cancellations bled into 2022, with Faith No More canning their plans for the entire year. Mr. Bungle would eventually get back on stage quite a few times, but Faith No More never recovered. Patton would later address the situation with Faith No More's other members, while Faith No More keyboardist Roddy Bottom briefly addressed the band's situation as a \"semi permanent hiatus. Then in a recent interview with Radio Futuro, Faith No More bassist Billy Gould offered what he knows about the band's current situation… and it ain't much. When asked what's going on with Faith No More these days, Gould responded: \"I don't know. I honestly don't know. And you don't have to believe me, but there's nothing. Right now we're in a really weird spot, a really strange spot, and I can't really tell you what's going on. I don't know myself. I get different information from people, and I'm in the band, so…\" Faith No More hasn't hit the road in a decade at this point. Faith No More completed a whole slew of dates in 2015 in support of their comeback record Sol Invictus, and played two shows in 2016 with former lead singer Chuck Mosley celebrate the reissue of their debut album We Care A Lot.
