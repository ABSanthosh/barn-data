  "text": "Songs of a Lost World isn’t just The Cure’s best album in decades; it’s also set a new commercial standard for the band in the US. The album hit No. 1 on five Billboard charts, becoming the first release in the band’s storied history to do so. Specifically, it topped Billboard’s Top Album Sales, Vinyl Albums, Top Rock \u0026 Alternative Albums, Top Rock Albums, and Top Alternative Albums charts (via Forbes). Songs of a Lost World also debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200, marking the band’s best performance on that chart since releasing Wish in 1992. Meanwhile, Songs of a Lost World went No. 1 on the UK’s albums chart. Earlier this month, The Cure celebrated the release of Songs of a Lost World with a career-spanning 31-song concert at London’s Troxy that was also streamed live online. Beginning next year, the band intends to tour extensively through their supposed retirement in 2029. Songs of a Lost World marks The Cure’s first new album in 18 years. Pick it up on vinyl here, or stream it below in Ultra HD via Amazon Music Unlimited.",
