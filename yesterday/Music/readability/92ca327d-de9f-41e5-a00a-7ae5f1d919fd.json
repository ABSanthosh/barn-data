  "text": "Looks like third time's the charm now that ex-Exodus singer Steve 'Zetro' Souza has called it quits for the third time with the metal band. \"This was the third time that I had joined the band, so I think it would be a bit redundant to try to do this again,\" Zetro revealed on his most recent episode of Zetro's Toxic Vault (as transcribed by Blabbermouth). He was joined by co-host – and longtime friend – Walter Morgan, where they discussed Zetro's third, and final, departure from Exodus. Though he stressed it didn't matter to him what the public thought occurred regarding his departure, whether he was quit or let go, but rather approached it from a different angle. Zetro was informed by his son that Exodus guitarist Gary Holt had clarified to the public that Zetro had been let go, and that he didn't actually quit. Rather than meeting that kind of claim with malice, on Zetro's Toxic Vault, Zetro actually agreed: \"I have to agree with his analogy. Being in a band is like a marriage – it truly is – and the marriage was over… I was never gonna quit, meaning maybe I thought I would never leave the marriage… but I truly think that it was probably the right thing for me especially, and I hope it's the right thing for them as well.\" And Exodus has had a rather long, and complicated, history with Zetro – well, actually, with all of their lead singers. Paul Baloff was lead singer from 1983 until 1987, when Steve Souza was onboarded. Then, Souza remained the lead singer until the band's hiatus in 1994. In 1997, Baloff reunites Exodus members again before Baloff's passing in 2002 where Souza returned to fill Baloff's slot on Exodus' then-upcoming tour and left shortly thereafter. Rob Dukes took over as vocalist from 2005 until 2014, before Souza filled in for a final time from 2014 until 2025. Now, Rob Dukes is frontman. You still with me? However, Zetro stresses that \"Gary Holt doesn't know how to write a shitty riff,\" and that fans will continue to get to enjoy \"Rob's era.\" Want More Metal?
