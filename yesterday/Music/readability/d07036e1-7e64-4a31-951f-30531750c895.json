  "text": "Following the last-minute cancellation of a Connecticut show on Thursday night (May 8th) due to drummer Sean Kinney’s “non-life-threatening medical emergency,” Alice in Chains have now scrapped all dates, including festival appearances, on their planned spring US tour. In a new statement issued Friday (May 9th), Alice in Chains explained, “After careful consideration and following the advice of medical professionals, we have made the decision to cancel our upcoming festival performances and the Alice in Chains headline shows.” The band continued, “While we were all eager to return to the stage, Sean’s health is our top priority at this moment. Although the issue requires immediate attention, his long-term prognosis is positive. We sincerely appreciate your understanding and support during this time.” As previously reported, Kinney experienced the undisclosed medical emergency right after Alice in Chains had completed their soundcheck at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut, where the veteran grunge band was set to kick off a brief US jaunt. The band had scheduled a handful of shows surrounding their appearances at the Sonic Temple and Welcome to Rockville festivals. Now all of those dates have been canceled, with no word yet on the band’s July 5th appearance at the final Black Sabbath concert in Birmingham, England. We’d like to extend our best wishes to Sean Kinney, with hopes for a full and speedy recovery. See the canceled dates and Alice in Chains’ social media post below.
