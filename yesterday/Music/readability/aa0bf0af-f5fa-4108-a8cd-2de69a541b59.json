  "text": "Dino Cazares of Fear Factory hasn't been quiet about his opinions regarding the use of AI in the music industry over the last few months. Hell, discussions of Fear Factory's forthcoming record revealed that it is further exploring the impact of AI on our society and expanding on Fear Factory's extensive discography. So, a few weeks ago, when one fan stated they were \"disappointed\" that some bands were using AI for album covers, Cazares offered up another take–\"But wouldn't you be a hypocrite too? Some of the software [you] use is AI. All information you put or see on social media is used to help AI grow, to help train it, just because you think you are not using it doesn't mean it's not using you.\" And he has a point. No matter what we, as people, do at this point – every single letter, number, idea, thought that is digitised, is used to train AI. Today, May 3rd, Dino Cazares took to Twitter (X) to say: \"We all can keep fighting about AI but the only one that’s winning is AI. People don’t realize it’s in everything we use, if you don’t want to help contribute to AI becoming more intelligent and powerful then get rid of all electronic devices, that’s where the battle begins because the Machines Of Hate prevail.\" We all can keep fighting about AI but the only one that’s winning is AI. People don’t realize it’s in everything we use, if you don’t want to help contribute to AI becoming more intelligent and powerful then get rid of all electronic devices, that’s where the battle begins…— Dino Cazares (@DinoCazares) May 3, 2025 Another user (@entoatucasa) responded with, \"I'm afraid the AI ship sailed a long time ago\" to which Cazares agreed and continued, \"Yeah and people don’t get it. They can cry all they want but it’s not going anywhere it’s getting more powerful every second…\" Yeah and people don’t get it. They can cry all they want but it’s not going anywhere it’s getting more powerful every second. We’ve talked about the world loosing there jobs to AI going listen to our record Obsolete( man is obsolete) https://t.co/girpZou0sw— Dino Cazares (@DinoCazares) May 3, 2025 Another Twitter user (@LegionofMaul) points out the obvious though – \"If I get rid of my electronic devices, how can I read your tweets?\" Cazares offers a simple solution: \"Exactly but if [you] want to win the battle against AI, getting rid of your devices is a start.\" And as the discourse continues and Cazares responds to various people, one (@brettis1ok) makes the point that \"you guys warned us in your music lol years ago.\" Which is true – Fear Factory is known for their explorative nature and fascination with technology, so Cazares' standpoint shouldn't be a surprise. But still, some air grievances with his sentiments including questions like, \"Does this mean [you're cool] with people using AI to generate more Fear Factory music then?\" To which Cazares simply states, \"You’re missing the point it’s already happening and there’s nothing I can do. I don’t have a choice in the matter. People have been stealing music and art for decades what’s any different then AI doing it? I’m not defending it just giving [you] the facts about it.\" You’re missing the point it’s already happening and there’s nothing I can do. I don’t have a choice in the matter. People have been stealing music and art for decades what’s any different then AI doing it? I’m not defending it just giving u the facts about it. https://t.co/CFMwD7drFn— Dino Cazares (@DinoCazares) May 3, 2025 So, with some valid opinions and a rather large discography under his belt, Cazares has a point – AI is everywhere.
