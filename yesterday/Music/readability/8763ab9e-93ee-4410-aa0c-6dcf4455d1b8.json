  "text": "Converge has been out on the road ripping through some classics while also introducing fans to new songs from their currently-unannounced new album. Footage of one song called \"W.W.N.T.S.\" has surfaced, which I'm assuming stands for \"we were never the same\" considering that's one of the lyrics repeated throughout the track. All we know is that Converge has roughly 27 new songs, though it's not clear how many of them were recorded, and how many of that crop made it to the new record. I guess we'll find out soon enough. The above footage was filmed during Converge's May 10 show at the Lincoln Factory in Detroit, MI. The full show was: \"Eagles Become Vultures\" \"Dark Horse\" \"Under Duress\" \"W.W.N.T.S.\" (New song) \"All We Love We Leave Behind\" \"Predatory Glow\" \"Hell to Pay\" \"Doom in Bloom\" (New song, live debut) \"Reap What You Sow\" \"Cutter\" \"Worms Will Feed/Rats Will Feast\" \"First Light\" \"Last Light\" \"Wolverine Blues\" (Entombed cover) \"I Can Tell You About Pain\" \"Concubine\" Converge's remaining tour dates are as follows: 6/14 Brooklyn, NY The Brooklyn Monarch (w/ Cave In, Ensign, Deadguy, etc.)6/15 Providence, RI Alchemy7/25 Indianapolis, IN Post.
