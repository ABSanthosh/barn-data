The new hit arrives with 3 million U.S. audience impressions in the tracking week of Nov. 1 -7, according to Luminate. Its strongest support came from a pair of Midwest stations, WHHH-FM in Indianapolis. and WIZF-FM in Cincinnati, while KRRL-FM in Los Angeles – a hometown station for all three performers – ranked third. With “Gorgeous,” Snoop Dogg collects his 69th credited appearance to the R\u0026B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart, Dr. Dre lands his 34th visit and Jhene Aiko notches her 16th entry.
