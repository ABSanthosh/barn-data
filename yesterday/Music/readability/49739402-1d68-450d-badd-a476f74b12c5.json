  "text": "After a four-year investigation, Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan J. Hochman has announced there will be no criminal charges filed against Marilyn Manson (real name Brian Warner) over allegations of domestic violence and sexual assault. According to a report by Billboard, the Los Angeles County District Attorney office has decided the statute of limitations has expired regarding allegations against Manson and that the allegations could not be proven in court. \"We recognize and applaud the courage and resilience of the women who came forward to make reports and share their experiences, and we thank them for their cooperation and patience with the investigation,\" reads a portion of a statement provided on the office's website by their Media Relations Division. \"While we are unable to bring charges in this matter, we recognize that the strong advocacy of the women involved has helped bring greater awareness to the challenges faced by survivors of domestic abuse and sexual assault. We also acknowledge and commend them for making an important contribution to extending the statute of limitations for the prosecution of domestic abuse locally and throughout the nation. Due to their efforts, victims of domestic violence have a greater voice in our criminal justice system and prosecutorial offices around the country have improved tools to hold domestic violence abusers accountable for their actions.\" In a statement to Billboard, Manson's attorney Howard King added: \"We are very pleased that, after a thorough and incredibly lengthy review of all of the actual evidence, the District Attorney has concluded what we knew and expressed from the start – Brian Warner is innocent.\" Investigation by the Los Angeles County District Attorney began in 2021, which resulted in a search of Manson's home. The investigation stretched into late 2024 when then-Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón issued a statement saying there was new evidence against Manson brought to their Sex Crimes Division regarding Manson. Gascón was voted out of office in December 3, 2024. Want More Metal?
