  "text": "Fresh off releasing his latest album, Highway Prayers, this past September, Billy Strings has stopped by The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Thanksgiving night a performance of his song, “Seven Weeks in County.” Taking the Tonight Show stage alongside his band, Strings brought the dark, gritty bluegrass sound of “Seven Weeks in County” to life, leaning into the remorseful Western narrative and playing the musical interludes with impressive ease. Throughout, the interplay of his group is on full display, dynamically ebbing and flowing as each of the instrument’s parts weaved together like a tapestry. Watch the video of the performance below. Get Billy Strings Tickets Here “Seven Weeks in County” arrived as the third single from Highway Prayers, which dropped on September 27th and became the first bluegrass record to hit No. 1 on Billboard’s all-genre Top Album Sales chart since 2002. In other Strings news, his live album, Live Vol. 1, was recently nominated for Best Bluegrass Album at the 2025 Grammy Awards. Up next, he’ll wrap up 2024 with the remainder of this year’s live dates, followed by bookings in 2025 stretching into March. Get tickets here.",
