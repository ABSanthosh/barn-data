  "text": "Crossfade is back for the first time in over a decade with two shows at Sonic Temple and Inkcarceration 2025. Crossfade in 2025 is vocalist and guitarist Ed Sloan, bassist and vocalist Mitch James, and guitarist and keyboardist Les Hall. The news comes via both festivals and an extensive documentary from Rock Feed, which you can check out below. \"We don't have a record. We don't have a record label. We may have those in the future, I don't know if we want those right now,\" said Sloan in the below documentary as transcribed by Metal Injection. \"But I do know that it feels right to say yes to this because that is who we are and apparently it is what people still care about – about rock music and about Crossfade and that feels amazing in and of itself. It's worth going to play [these shows] to see what happens.\" Who is Crossfade? Crossfade is an alternative rock band from Columbia, SC. Crossfade released three albums throughout their career – their self-titled debut album in 2004, Falling Away in 2006, and We All Bleed in 2011 – before falling silent in 2012 after drummer Mark Castillo quit the band. Despite the decade-plus silence, Crossfade never announced they had broken up or gone on hiatus. Where can I see Crossfade live? Crossfade will play Sonic Temple in May 2025 and Inkcarceration in July 2025. Of the reunion show, Sonic Temple wrote: \"Reuniting for their very first performance in 13 years, we are proud to add to our Historic Rock \u0026 Metal Lineup by welcoming multi-platinum band CROSSFADE onto the @sonictemplefestival Lineup! \"The post-grunge rockers burst onto the scene in the early 2000s, making an unforgettable impact with their debut single 'Cold'. Their follow-up hits like 'Colors' and 'So Far Away' further cemented their place in the rock world, earning them radio success across multiple formats. \"Despite their long absence, Crossfade's music has had remarkable staying power, with listenership only continuing to grow across the globe. For years, rock fans have been asking us to make this reunion happen. We are so grateful to the band for coming together with us to finally make this a special reality in 2025!\" Want More Metal?
