  "text": "Jason Momoa spent years portraying Aquaman in the pre-James Gunn DC cinematic universe, and it now looks like Gunn and company will bring him along as they attempt to restart the franchise — albeit as a different character. As confirmed by Deadline, Momoa will play the role of Lobo in the upcoming film Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, marking the character’s first onscreen portrayal. The former Game of Thrones actor has often been likened to Lobo’s usual depiction, and Momoa himself has even expressed interest in the role in the past. “I collect comics, and I don’t do so much anymore, but [Lobo] was always my favorite, and I always wanted to play Lobo, because I’m like, ‘Hello? It’s the perfect role,’ … If they call and ask me to play him, it’s a fuck yeah” Momoa posted to Instagram, taking the quote from a past interview. Along side the snippet, Momoa simply commented, “They called.” Little is known about the upcoming Supergirl project other than a few key personnel details. Outside of Momoa’s casting of the violent anti-hero, Milly Alcock (House of the Dragon) will take on the lead role and Matthias Schoenaerts will play the villain, Krem of the Yellow Hills. Craig Gillespie is set to direct, and Ana Nogueira helmed the script. Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow is scheduled to hit theaters on June 26th, 2026. The first taste of what it’ll contribute to the new DC cinematic universe will likely come via Gunn’s Superman film, which just released its first trailer and is due out July 11th, 2025. Lobo is just the latest high profile role for Momoa. In addition to the Aquaman films, he has appeared in franchises like Dune and The Fast and the Furious. He’ll also feature in the upcoming video game film A Minecraft Movie.",
