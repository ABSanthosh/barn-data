  "text": "While playing at Coachella last weekend, frontman Rivers Cuomo let it slip that the band was working on a “Weezer movie back in L.A.” While he stopped short of divulging any other details, according to a report from film insider Jeff Sneider, the project is “mockumentary” described as a cross between Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and Weird: The Al Yankovic Story. And none other than Keanu Reeves has reportedly been cast to play the villain in the film. Reeves and Weezer actually go way back: the band’s first-ever public gig was opening for Reeves’ own group, Dogstar, in 1992. In 2024, the two bands reunited — this time with Dogstar opening for Weezer as they celebrated the 30th anniversary of The Blue Album. Apparently, Weezer and Reeves’ three-decade “rivalry” is a key part of the film’s plot. Along with Reeves, the Weezer movie will reportedly star Juliette Lewis, Eric Andre, Johnny Knoxville, and Ben Schwartz, in addition to the band members themselves. Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman are co-directing the film, with David Leitch producing.",
