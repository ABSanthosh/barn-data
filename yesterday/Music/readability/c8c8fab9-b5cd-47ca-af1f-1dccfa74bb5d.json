  "text": "The event will be held in Manchester's Co-op Live in 2026 and 2027. A general view of the Co-op Live arena on May 8, 2024 in Manchester, England. Christopher Furlong/Getty Images The BRIT Awards will move to Manchester in 2026 and 2027, marking the first time the ceremony has taken place outside of London in its nearly-50 year history. Co-op Live, the venue operated by Oak View Group, will host the event on Feb. 28, 2026 and be broadcast live on ITV 1 and ITV X; 2027’s date is yet to be confirmed.  The 2025 event was held in March at The O2 Arena in London, the ceremony’s home since 2012. The BRITs has been held at various venues in the capital including Earl’s Court (1996-2011), Alexandra Palace (1993-1995) and The Grosvenor Hotel (1982-1987).  The first event in 1977 was held at the Wembley Conference Centre, and the BRITs became a yearly occurrence from 1982 onwards; the 2021 event was the first major event to take place in the U.K. following the outbreak of the COVID pandemic a year prior. Trending on Billboard 2026 marks the first event of the three-year stewardship under Sony Music U.K.; stewardship rotates between the three major labels, with the BRIT Committee overseeing the show’s creative direction. Damian Christian, the managing director and president of promotions at Atlantic Records, a Warner Music subsidiary, served as the chair of the BRIT Committee from 2022-2025. “Moving to Manchester, the home of some of the most iconic and defining artists of our lifetime, will invigorate the show and build on the BRITs legacy of celebrating and reinvesting in world-class music,” says Jason Isley MBE, chairman and CEO, Sony Music U.K. \u0026 Ireland. “Hosting the show in Manchester, with its vibrant cultural history, perfectly captures the spirit and energy of the BRIT Awards. I can’t wait to see the show at the amazing state-of-the art Co-op Live venue.”  Despite a beleaguered opening which saw delays and cancellation of shows in April 2024, the Co-op Live has since established itself as a key player in the U.K. live music scene. In 2024, the venue hosted the MTV EMAs, and 2025’s live slate includes Bruce Springsteen \u0026 The E Street Band, Olivia Rodrigo, Tyler, The Creator and more. The venue’s 23,500 capacity makes it the largest indoor arena in Europe. Tim Leiweke, co-founder and CEO of Oak View Group said: “The BRITs are the most important music event in the UK and were always the highlight of the year, not only because of its immense cultural contribution, but because of their commitment to improving the lives of youth through music.  It is our honour to partner with our friends at BPI and Sony Music, alongside the great city of Manchester, to host the BRITs at Co-op Live and join in their mission to create opportunities for youth through music.” The BRIT Awards regularly pulls big name performers, with 2025’s ceremony boasting live performances by Sabrina Carpenter, Lola Young, Teddy Swims and Sam Fender. Charli XCX, meanwhile, collected five awards on the night, including album of the year. The move follows the relocation of the MOBO Awards in recent years to Coventry (2021) and Sheffield (2024), and the Mercury Prize which is set to be hosted in Newcastle’s Utilita Arena in September 2025.
