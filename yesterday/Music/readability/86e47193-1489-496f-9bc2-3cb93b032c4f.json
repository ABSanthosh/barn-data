  "text": "The Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame has revealed its class of 2025: The White Stripes, OutKast, Soundgarden, Cyndi Lauper, Joe Cocker, Bad Company, and Chubby Checker will all be inducted during a ceremony held in Los Angeles on November 8th. In addition, Warren Zevon and Salt-N-Peppa will be inducted into the Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame in the Musical Excellence category. Other inductees include Carol Kaye, Thom Bell, and Nicky Hopkins, all of who will be honored with the Musical Influence Award. Music industry executive Lenny Waronker will receive the Ahmet Ertegun Award. This year’s inductees were determined by an international voting body of more than 1,200 artists, historians, and members of the music industry, as well as a fan vote.  In order to be eligible, a nominee’s first recording must have been released at least 25 years ago. Notably, OutKast, Cocker, Bad Company, and Checker were all first-time nominees. Among this year’s finalists who did not make the final cut were fan vote winner Phish, Oasis, Mariah Carey, Joy Division/New Order, Billy Idol, Maná, and The Black Crowes. The Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame’s 2025 induction ceremony will take place at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on Saturday, November 8th, and will stream live on Disney+. It will also be available on Hulu following its premiere, and will receive a special broadcast airing on ABC.",
