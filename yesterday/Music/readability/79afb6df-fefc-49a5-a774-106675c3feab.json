  "text": "Sam Moore, the soul singer best known as one half of Sam \u0026 Dave, has died, according to a press release from 2911 Media. The musician’s death occurred on January 10, in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications after surgery. Moore was 89 years old.Moore is best known for his tenor vocal work in the award-winning pair, whose 1967 crossover hit “Soul Man” was a trailblazing soul and gospel landmark and a civil rights anthem. Moore was a member of the Grammy Hall of Fame, the Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame, and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame for both his achievements with Sam \u0026 Dave and his solo work.Born in Miami, Florida, Moore began singing gospel at church and eventually started performing in Miami’s R\u0026B scene, where he met Dave Prater. They formed Sam \u0026 Dave, a gospel-inspired call-and-response act. A few years after gaining local success, they signed to Atlantic Records, in 1964, before being shipped out to Memphis to record at Stax. Backed by the songwriting duo of Isaac Hayes and David Porter, Sam \u0026 Dave released several charting R\u0026B singles, including breakout single “Hold On, I’m Comin’” and the Grammy-winning “Soul Man.” Sam \u0026 Dave first broke up in 1970 and last performed together in 1981. Over the course of their career, the artists sold more than 10 million records.Moore began his solo career after the 1970 breakup, and, while he and Prater got back together a year later, he continued to record and perform on his own. (Prater died in a car crash in 1988.) Moore recorded his first solo album, Plenty Good Lovin’, in 1970, but the album did not see the light of day until 2002. He worked on the record with luminaries such as Aretha Franklin, Betty Wright, Bernard Purdie, and Chuck Rainey, among others.Moore released another solo album, Overnight Sensational, in 2006. The comeback album featured Jon Bon Jovi, Fantasia, Sting, Sheila E., Mariah Carey, and one of Moore’s biggest musical champions, Bruce Springsteen.Beyond music, Moore, who struggled with substance use, was an anti-drug advocate and volunteer for anti-drug programs. He was also a staunch proponent of artists’ royalties and rights.",
