  "text": "Well… various jokes could be made – hell, I had to filter out a few myself. But, in all seriousness, Twisted Sister has sold the band's remaining recording copyrights to Warner Music Group. Not only did they sell the rest of their recording rights, they also sold their names, image, likeness, and trademarks – so, Twisted Sister have pretty much sold everything. So far, no one knows how much Twisted Sister will receive for selling the rights. However, it shouldn't come as too much as a surprise after singer Dee Snider decided to sell his catalog to Universal Music Group back in 2015. Couple that sale alongside the fact that none of the band's children have any interest in continuing the \"Twisted Sister business,\" according to an interview with Jay Jay French for Forbes. Twisted Sister's hit singles, \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" and \"Stay Hungry,\" were amongst the songs sold back in 2015. Well… don't make me say it. You know what I'm thinking. Check out the legendary single below. Want More Metal?
