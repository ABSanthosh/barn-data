  "text": "Anything can happen at Coachella, including having Senator Bernie Sanders introduce Clairo’s set. You read that right: Sanders appeared onstage at the Outdoor Theatre this Saturday to open Clairo’s show, and implored festivalgoers to fight for justice at every turn: “You can turn away and you can ignore what goes on but if you do that, you do it at your own peril,” he told the crowd Saturday night. Maxwell Frost, the representative for Florida’s 10th congressional district, appeared beforehand to bring out the Vermont Senator. Frost was elected in 2023 at 25 years old, making him the youngest member of Congress. Sanders provided an abridged addition of his recent “Fighting Oligarchy” rallies, covering the Trump administration’s upheavals on women’s rights, climate change, the economy, Gaza, and more. Get Clairo Tickets Here “This country faces some very difficult challenges,” Sanders said. “The future of what happens to America is dependent upon your generation…We need you to stand up, to fight for justice. To fight for economic justice, social justice, and racial justice.” That same day, Sanders had hosted his “Fighting Oligarchy” rally in Los Angeles alongside Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He continued, discussing the need to protest in opposition of abortion laws in red states like Florida: “All over this country, not in California or Vermont from where I’m from, but Florida… Politicians are trying to take away a woman’s right to control her own body. We need you to stand up and fight for women’s rights.” Since May 2024, Florida has enacted a six-week ban on abortions, a timeframe in which most mothers would not even know they’re pregnant. Sanders also touched on the economy and the healthcare system: “We have an economy today that is working very well for the billionaire class but not for working families. We need you to help us to create an economy that works well for everybody, not just the one percent. We have a healthcare system that is broken. We are the only major country not to guarantee healthcare to all people. We need you to stand up to the insurance companies and the drug companies and understand that healthcare is a human right.” After his two-cents, Sanders introduced Clairo: “I’m here because Clairo has used her prominence to fight for women’s rights, to try to end the terrible brutal war in Gaza where thousands of women and children are being killed. So I want to thank Clairo not only for being in a great band, but for the great work she’s doing.” Clairo performed 13 tracks including recent Charm favorites “Juna,” “Add Up My Love,” and “Sexy to Someone.” Clairo will play a handful of festivals through the summer, including Primavera Sound, Governors Ball, Lollapalooza, and more.
