  "text": "Warner Bros. has opted to lean into the rowdy, Gen Z-fueled experience of many Minecraft Movie showings by announcing special “Block Party Edition” screenings, which encourage audience participation. The showings will begin on May 2nd across North America, inviting fans to talk or sing along with their favorite moments from the blockbuster hit. “You know the moments,” the announcement reads. “You know the lines. You love the songs! Now it’s time to get loose, laugh out loud, and belt out those lyrics like a true diamond-tier fan.” See where you can get tickets to A Minecraft Movie: Block Party Edition! here. Since the film’s opening weekend, a viral trend has seen young moviegoers screaming and throwing popcorn during certain moments, such as when Jack Black yells, “I am Steve!” There is also a “chicken jockey” meme referencing the moment when a baby zombie falls onto the back of a chicken. While this has resulted in some theaters posting warnings against such behavior and drawn a mixed response from moviegoers, it also helped fuel a record-setting opening weekend for a video game movie adaptation. “It’s funny because I think it’s just literally cheering and throwing popcorn, which is so funny to me that cops are getting called for popcorn,” director Jared Hess told Entertainment Weekly. “It’s great, especially when people are climbing on their friends’ shoulders and standing up and cheering for those moments. It’s like this crazy anticipation. But, man, I’m just glad people are making memories with their friends and families.” Based on the video game of the same name, A Minecraft Movie stars Jack Black alongside Jason Momoa, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, Jennifer Coolidge, and more. It holds the biggest domestic box office of 2025 so far, raking in $380 million to date. Internationally, the film has grossed $815 million.",
