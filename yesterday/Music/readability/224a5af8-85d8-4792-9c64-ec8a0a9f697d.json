  "text": "The title is featured on single art in a post Del Rey shared on Instagram. Lana Del Rey attends the InStyle Imagemaker Awards on Oct. 24, 2024 in Bel Air, California. Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Lana Del Rey‘s “Henry, Come On,” a new song in advance of upcoming album The Right Person Will Stay, is ostensibly coming soon. Del Rey teased the title overlayed on apparent single art without comment on Instagram, in a post that has her gazing demurely into the camera. “Henry,” which doesn’t have a confirmed release date yet, might ring a bell for fans of Del Rey, who’s dressed in white lace, complemented by carefully placed waves and a muted red lip, in the new promotional image. When announcing The Right Person Will Stay‘s May 21 release date four months ago, Del Rey had noted, “Happy for you to hear a few songs coming up before Stagecoach starting with Henry.” “Henry” was in reference to the title now known to be “Henry, Come On,” a track she actually first teased more than a year ago. Trending on Billboard Del Rey is performing at the 2025 edition of Stagecoach, the annual country music festival in Indio, Calif., before a stadium tour in U.K. and Ireland that begins in June. She’s got top billing on Stagecoach’s Palomino Stage on Friday, April 25, with festival organizers saying she’ll have “a very special country set.” Zach Bryan headlines the fest’s “Mane” Stage the same night. Del Rey first previewed “Henry, Come On” in January 2024 in a snippet that was also posted on Instagram, tagging Nashville songwriter/producer Luke Laird, no stranger to Billboard‘s country music charts and a two-time Grammy winner (most recently in 2019, as co-writer on Kacey Musgraves’ “Space Cowboy”). On the “Henry” post this week, Laird was again among the names tagged. Also tagged is longtime Del Rey collaborator Dean Reid, who’s worked with the songstress in various production capacities over the years, most recently on several tracks on Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd. Drew Erickson, who worked with Del Rey on production and songwriting for Blue Banisters and Ocean Blvd, is also tagged on the post. With quiet contemplation and sparse acoustic guitar, the first hint of “Henry” lyrically references the country influence Del Rey originally indicated was in store for her next album, when her next album was known as Lasso. “I mean, Henry, come on/ Do you think I’d really choose it?/ All this off and on, Henry, come on/ I mean, baby, come on/ Do you think I’d really lose it on ya?/ If you did nothin’ wrong, Henry, come on,” she sings, with a whisper on the latter mention of Henry’s name leading up to the hook: “Last call, hey, y’all/ Hang his hat up on the wall/ Tell him that his cowgirl is gone/ Come on and giddyup.” See the “Henry, Come On” art and the previously shared audio clip, both embedded below from Instagram.
