  "text": "The couple, who have been dating since last summer, were seen in a suite enjoying beers and chatting with each other. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce attend Game One of the American League Championship Series between the Cleveland Guardians and the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium on October 14, 2024 in New York City. Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images From the football field to the baseball diamond! Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce went to Yankees Stadium on Monday night (Oct. 14) to watch the first American League Championship Series game between the New York Yankees and the Cleveland Guardians. Explore See latest videos, charts and news In photos circulating social media, the duo decided to match on their date night, both rocking black caps and black coats to the event. While it’s not immediately clear who they’re rooting for, it could be a house divided, as Kelce is from Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and Swift is a longtime New York City resident. The couple, who have been dating since last summer, were seen in a suite enjoying beers and chatting with each other. “Welcome to New York, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce!” an MLB post on Twitter read, fittingly referencing Swift’s 1989 album opener. Trending on Billboard Swift and Kelce are, obviously, no strangers to a sports game. During the football season, the “Fortnight” singer is often spotted cheering on her tight end boyfriend and the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. However, they’ve also attended other sporting events, including the U.S. Open at Arthur Ashe Stadium in Queens in September, alongside Kelce’s Chiefs teammate Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany. At one point, Swift and Kelce were filmed in the middle of an animated sing-along to “I Believe in a Thing Called Love” by The Darkness playing over the stadium’s loudspeaker. Swift also made her way to Yankees Stadium back in 2022, but not for a game. She was presented with an honorary doctorate at NYU’s Spring 2022 graduation ceremony, where she gave an inspiring commencement speech for the graduating class.
