From 14 No.1s on the Billboard200 to 14 Grammy Awards, we’re breaking it down for you. Which Taylor Swift era is your favorite? Let us know in the comments! Tetris Kelly: With 12 No.1s on the Hot 100 chart, 14 No.1s on the Billboard 200, and 14 Grammy Awards, Billboard staff has named Taylor Swift as No.2 on our Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st century countdown! Taylor started out making country music inspired by Shania Twain, LeAnn Rimes, The Chicks, and had a successful start with several top 40 hits like “Our Song,” “Should’ve Said No,” and “Picture to Burn.” Her second album, ‘Fearless,’ became Taylor’s first No.1 on the Billboard 200 \u0026 ruled the No.1 spot for 11 weeks! She earned her first top 5 hits during this era with “You Belong With Me” and “Love Story.” ‘Fearless’ won Taylor her first Grammy for Album of the Year! Her third album, ‘Speak Now’ earned her second No.1 album. Her fourth album ‘Red’ produced Taylor’s first No.1 hit on the Hot 100, “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” and showed that Taylor was ready to experiment with her sound. The album became her third consecutive No.1 on the Billboard 200 and gained a second life when “Taylor’s Version” was released in 2021 propelling the hit “All Too Well -Taylor’s Version-” to No.1. But Taylor Swift’s fifth album ‘1989’ changed everything! Establishing her as the biggest force in pop music. ‘1989’ gave us “Style,” “Wildest Dreams,” and three No.1 hits with “Shake It Off,” “Blank Space,” and her collab with Kendrick Lamar, “Bad Blood.” ‘1989’ earned Taylor her fourth consecutive No.1 album and it topped the chart for 11 weeks. Keep watching for more!",
