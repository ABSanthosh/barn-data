  "text": "SZA and Keke Palmer had natural chemistry during their joint Saturday Night Live episode, back in 2022, and, now, they’re reviving that for an even bigger screen. The two co-star in a new buddy comedy film called One of Them Days that hits theaters on January 24. The movie will serve as the SOS singer’s acting debut in a feature film. Watch the trailer below.One of Them Days follows SZA and Palmer as two best friends and roommates struggling to pay rent after one of their boyfriends spends all their money. Cue the laughs as they embark on a hijinks-filled day to fulfill the payment and maintain their close friendship. The R-rated movie is directed by Lawrence Lamont, produced by Issa Rae, and written by Rae’s frequent collaborator Syreeta Singleton. Rounding out the cast are Lil Rel Howery, Janelle James, Maude Apatow, Keyla Monterroso Mejia, Katt Williams, Joshua Neal, Aziza Scott, and Patrick Cage.SZA cleaned up at the Grammy Awards earlier this year, winning Best R\u0026B Song, for “Snooze,” Best Progressive R\u0026B Album, for SOS, and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, for “Ghost in the Machine,” with Phoebe Bridgers. She also performed “Kill Bill” while dancers engaged in katana-wielding fights around her. Since then, she’s released the one-off single “Saturn.”Read about SZA’s SOS at No. 1 in “The 50 Best Albums of 2023.”",
