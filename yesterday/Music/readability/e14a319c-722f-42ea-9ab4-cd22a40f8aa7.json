  "text": "Swedish hard rock band Crucified Barbara has reunited after breaking up in 2016. At the time, Crucified Barbara cited the years taking their toll on them and \"the joy of playing together got lost somewhere along the way.\" Crucified Barbara will play their first show in roughly 10 years next year at the Sweden Rock Festival where they'll celebrate 20 years of the In Distortion We Trust record. \"Dear all, It's been a while, to say the least!\" wrote Crucified Barbara. \"Our last gig was almost ten years ago. The break has been much needed for all of us, but… our love for our music, for each other, and for our audience has never faded during these years. Next year is the twentieth anniversary of the release of In Distortion We Trust and we want to celebrate with you! \"We'll do this by playing the best tunes from our four albums live next summer! Our re-union will debut at Sweden Rock Festival, taking place June 4-7, 2025! \"We've already had some magical moments in the rehearsal room and are amazed at how our music still lives within us, longing to be played. We can't wait to perform live for you all again!\" As they've always been, Crucified Barbara in 2024 is guitarist and vocalist Mia \"Coldheart\" Karlsson, guitarist Klara \"Force\" Rönnqvist Fors, bassist Ida \"Evileye\" Stenbacka, and drummer Jannicke \"Nicki Wicked\" Lindström. Crucified Barbara has released four albums over their career – In Distortion We Trust in 2005, 'Til Death Do Us Party in 2009, The Midnight Chase in 2012, and In The Red in 2014. Want More Metal?
