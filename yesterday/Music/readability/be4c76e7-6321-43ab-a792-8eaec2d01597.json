  "text": "Last month, the sisters Haim graced the internet with a snippet of new music—a breezy pop track that questioned the point of “fucking relationships.” Now, the Los Angeles trio has released the song in full. It’s called “Relationships.” The song was produced by Rostam Batmanglij and Danielle Haim, and marks Haim’s first piece of new music since 2023, when they contributed “Home” to Barbie the Album. “Relationships” arrives with a music video directed by Camille Summers-Valli and starring Queer actor Drew Starkey. Check it out below.Since their initial TikTok teaser, Haim have been posting additional snippets of the song, usually accompanied by the sisters dancing and lip-syncing along. They’ve also shared visual hints at the song’s theme, such as photos of bracelets that are stamped with different relationship statuses: “Single,” “I’m Taken,” and “I’m ???”According to a press release, “Relationships” is the first taste of a forthcoming new Haim album. Haim issued their most recent studio album, Women in Music Pt. III, in 2020. The sisters followed that record with a string of one-off singles such as “Cherry Flavored Stomach Ache” and “Lost Track.” They also cut the original song “Feel the Thunder” for the animated film The Croods: A New Age, and shared remixes with Toro y Moi and one Taylor Swift.Haim have been rather mum about new music in recent years, save for a brief mention of it in a 2023 interview with BBC Radio 6’s Lauren Laverne. During that appearance, the sisters played Jai Paul’s “Jasmine” and then hinted that they were possibly working with the famously reclusive producer. “We played Jai Paul earlier; we might’ve been in the studio with him,” they said. “We may or may not have been in the studio with him…. Cannot confirm or deny.”Revisit the 2020 piece “RIYL: Haim’s Women in Music Pt. III.” Plus, read the new review of “Relationships.”",
