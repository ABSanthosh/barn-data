  "text": "Earlier this year, German power metal pioneers Helloween signed with Reigning Phoenix Music (RPM) to release their next studio album. Following the success of their acclaimed 2021 self-titled record, the band entered the studio this past summer to begin work on what promises to be an exciting new chapter, slated for release in 2025. Speaking with The Rockpit, vocalist Michael Kiske shared insights about the album's progress. \"We're working on it. We're right on it. We're getting this done,\" he said. Kiske also revealed that he will head to Tenerife, Spain, in early January to work on vocals at Mi Sueño Studio, owned by co-vocalist Andi Deris. He described the collaboration process, which often involves fine-tuning vocal arrangements and completing lyrics on-site. \"Sometimes they still have to do lyrics, but then figuring out who does what and trying things out,\" he explained. The sunny escape couldn't come at a better time for Kiske, who added, \"I'm looking forward to it, because it's really cold and gray and dark here in Germany at the moment. So I don't mind flying over there for a couple of weeks.\" In a recent interview with The Metal Command, Andi Deris shared his perspective on the new material, comparing it to the 2021 Helloween album: \"I'd say it's much more easy listening, because there's less constructed stuff on it. It's more flowing with the wind, so to say. It's very, very positive, so I would rather say it's more happy, happy Helloween than the other album,\" he remarked. He acknowledged that the previous album had an edgier and more demanding sound. \"The last album, for me, was great to listen through — it was edgy, it was heavy, it was complicated here and there — but after listening to it, then I needed a pause. It was exhausting. After listening to Helloween, I needed some break, put it that way. I loved it, and I still love it, but it's demanding.\" Deris emphasized that the new album offers a different energy: \"I think the next album will be much easier listening, I think much more enjoyable to sing along to; there are lots of parts in there. So I would rather describe it as a more happy, happy Helloween album. That would be the best description.\" Deris attributed the band's newfound ease in creating music to the confidence they've developed since the last album. He explained how their workflow has become more efficient: \"The last album, we had to get to know each other in that new setup, lineup, how to work with each other, how to work here and blah, blah, blah, and this time we just realized, okay, actually everybody has such great ideas; just don't control each other.\" The band leaned heavily on modern technology, with members working remotely and collaborating online. \"Internet is great, and you can have live sessions online, and that made life so much easier because everybody is just relieved that you are still at home,\" Deris explained. \"You still work hard, but you're at home. And as we all know, when you're at home, work doesn't hurt that much as being back in the studio again somewhere in the world, but not with your family,\" This approach has allowed for a more balanced lifestyle, with Deris noting, \"You still work hard, but you're at home… you yourself decide when you make a break or when you go and have a meal with your lady or go down to the beach, in my case.\" Keeping all seven members – Michael Kiske, Kai Hansen, Andi Deris, Michael Weikath, Sascha Gerstner, Markus Grosskopf, and Daniel Löble – on the same page has been a remarkable feat. Deris credited their success to understanding and respecting each other's differences: \"I think the only thing you need to accept is that you are different people. I think that's the main problem we had back in the days because everybody actually expected the other to be and react and have the same opinion as yourself.\" \"You need that experience, and when you have that, you are a little bit more humble, because you know you did things wrong or you know you haven't been right back in the days here and there and blah, blah, blah. So, if you take that at a base, everything works out fine.\" Want More Metal?
