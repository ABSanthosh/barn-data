  "text": "With a prolific career in Kiss, Gene Simmons stands as one of the most successful rock n' roll stars, leaving his mark on countless anthemic tracks. Despite that, he insists he's no bass virtuoso — not that anyone would consider him as such — and has clearly said he's never aimed to be one. In a forthcoming interview with Guitar World, Simmons opened up about his disdain for \"show-offs in music\" and his preference for memorable simplicity over complex technical skill. \"I don't consider myself—and was never really interested in being—a bass virtuoso,\" Simmons reflects while discussing his catalog of hits. \"I don't like show-offs in music. I'm much more attracted to things that are memorable. It's part of the joy of music for me.\" For Simmons, \"virtuosity\" is secondary to impact. He's quick to point out that while jazz musicians are respected within musical circles, they lack the broad appeal that resonates with the average listener. \"You can be a jazz player and be respected by musicians, but the rest of the world doesn't care,\" he adds. \"We're going to play a game: name a jazz player that means something.\" Citing John McLaughlin as an example, he challenges, \"He's a great player. But here's a question: can you hum any melody that he's ever played on a solo? Of course not. With all due respect, that music is intended to show off how well you play – but I don't care about that. The hardest thing to do is write a good simple song or riff. That's really hard.\" Simmons' critique doesn't stop at jazz musicians. He also mentions renowned bass players like Jaco Pastorius and Flea, noting their impressive skills but questioning the lasting impact of their work. \"There are an awful lot of amazing bass players, like Jaco Pastorius and the jazz guys. Or guys like Flea, who is really good on his instrument, but I can't remember anything he plays – and I also do not like the sound of a bass being slapped.\" For Simmons, the \"less is more\" principle is a guiding philosophy. He values simplicity that sticks with the listener over technical displays that fade quickly from memory. Reflecting on this, he recalls an influential comment by Eric Clapton: \"Clapton, before he went pop, and when he was considered ‘God,' he was interviewed, and he said something very profound: ‘The hardest thing to do is to know what notes to put in a solo, and what notes not to put in a solo.'\" It's this ethos of keeping it simple yet unforgettable that Simmons believes is key to music's impact. \"Sometimes, if it's shockingly simple, and barely moving at all, but I can hum it, that's what matters because it's memorable.\" Want More Metal?
