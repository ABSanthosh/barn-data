The outing kicks off on April 10th in Minneapolis and runs through May 28th in Cleveland, with notable stops in Las Vegas and Chicago along the way. It will be AC/DC’s first US trek since 2016’s “Rock or Bust Tour,” which famously saw Axl Rose replace frontman Brian Johnson on a portion of the final US leg after the latter was forced to sit out due to hearing problems. After the tour, AC/DC didn’t play another show until they returned to the stage in October 2023 for a one-off gig at the Power Trip festival in Indio, California. A UK/European tour followed earlier this year. The upcoming run also marks the band’s first North American tour in support of their latest studio album, 2020’s Power Up. The current touring lineup includes Johnson, lead guitarist Angus Young, rhythm guitarist Stevie Young, drummer Matt Laug, and bass player Chris Chaney. Who Is Opening for AC/DC’s Stadium Tour?
