  "text": "Welcome back to Fan Chant, a weekly column for K-pop fans, stans, and newbies alike. This week, we absolutely must discuss the latest from BSS. If you enjoy what you’re reading, feel free to subscribe to my companion newsletter to get Fan Chant delivered right to your inbox each week! When listening to the newest release from BSS, I couldn’t help but think of this quote1 from Michelle Obama: “You have done it again. Constantly raising the bar for us all and doing it flawlessly. I’d like to say I’m surprised, but I know who you are.” Regrettably, I had not yet been pulled into Caratland when BSS first arrived on the scene. But what a concept! How brave of SEVENTEEN to isolate a trio of some of the most — if not the most — delightfully unhinged members of their band with the express purpose of releasing the highest threshold of uplifting and contagiously energetic music imaginable. Thankfully, I had gotten it together by the time BooSeokSoon made their first comeback with “Fighting,” a song that landed within the top 20 of my Spotify Wrapped in 2023. BSS is made up of SEVENTEEN members Seungkwan, DK, and Hoshi, and the acronym for BooSeokSoon comes from their respective birth names (Boo Seungkwan, Lee Seokmin, and Kwon Soonyoung). If that’s hard to remember for anyone new to the diamond life, don’t worry — they repeat it multiple times during “Fighting,” and they’ve done the same with their new single, “CBZ (Prime time).” And what a song it is. To say the combination of the stomp-clap beat, jangling piano, and outrageous choreography was perfectly tailored to these three feels like an understatement. The song also feels a bit reminiscent of SEVENTEEN’s beloved “HOME; RUN” era, which makes sense considering “CBZ” was produced by the team’s very own maestro, Woozi. If you’re not hooked by the point the whispered bridge arrives, surely Seungkwan’s delivery of “yeoboseyo” into the final chorus will be what seals the deal. DK’s absurd last vocal run — which he has successfully landed every time they’ve done a live performance of the song, amidst wildly demanding choreography — is icing on the cake. He’s one of the best we have, folks! No one commits to the bit quite like these three. While the concepts and energy behind their music as BSS is heightened and often somewhat silly, they treat their releases with utter seriousness, and that’s what makes them so very fun to watch. Quite a bit of SEVENTEEN’s discography feels wonderfully musical theater-adjacent, but the choreography for “CBZ” takes that parallel to new heights. As the song continues to hit in my daily rotation, I’ll be treating Hoshi’s impending enlistment the way I treat all enlistment news: With total and utter denial, up until the exact moment that I’m unable to keep doing so. 1This quote is from a video message Michelle Obama sent to congratulate Beyoncé, but if we are discussing who could be the Beyoncé of K-pop, Boo Seungkwan has to at least be in the conversation. Hobi on Tourj-hope, photo by Joshua Druding It’s happening: “Hope on the Stage” is coming to North America, and tickets go on sale next week. Here’s how to have the best shot at securing tickets to what’s quickly become one of the most hotly anticipated tours. Song Rec of the Week: I’d heard quite a bit of buzz about this debut and was thoroughly impressed upon clicking on the music video. These guys have a lot of Taemin energy (as we know, a huge compliment), but I am disappointed that I really dislike that first part of the chorus. I’m never one for the kind of talk-singing exhibited in the refrain, and this song had such a smooth vibe going that it really took me out of it. Regardless, their concept is interesting enough that I’ll be keeping an eye on this group.",
