  "text": "After a considerably lengthy gestation process, Anthrax frontman Joey Belladonna has officially wrapped up tracking vocals for the legendary thrash band's highly anticipated twelfth studio album — their first full-length since 2016's For All Kings. The writing and recording process for the new album began during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, with longtime producer Jay Ruston (Stone Sour, Avatar) once again behind the board. Despite the band's initial momentum, progress was gradual. As recently as August 2023, guitarist Scott Ian admitted to struggling with finalizing lyrics, though Belladonna had already begun laying down vocal parts before the year's end. Now, in a new interview with Rebel Radio 92.5 FM, Belladonna confirmed that his work on the record is complete: \"You know what? I finished the vocals. I'm really happy with what I've done. And the band sounds great on the record. And as far as I know right now, we're still finishing up a few things. We're not even mixing yet, so at this point I'd be just speculating [about a possible release date]. Obviously, things are going in the right form and the timing is right. So, all good. I'm happy. You're gonna love it.\" In a 2024 conversation with Guitar World, Ian revealed the band is eyeing an early 2025 release for the long-awaited follow-up to For All Kings. He also shared insight into the record's direction: \"There are crushing riffs and great, hooky choruses. Even some of the thrashiest songs have great choruses. We're always looking for the hook, and I think we've accomplished that.\" \"With the songs we've written, we'd be able to put together a nine- or 10-song record that would be thrashier than anything we've done in a long time. But there would also be a way to make it a very different kind of album depending on which songs we choose. And I can tell you, I know which way I'm leaning… We want this record to punch people in the face.\" Drummer Charlie Benante also teased new sonic territory in an August 2024 interview with Metal Hammer. He referenced a track reminiscent of the band's more epic compositions, like 'In the End' and 'Blood Eagle Wings': \"There's a song which has the same kind of epic feel… It revolves around the journey we've been on in the band. And there are three songs that don't sound like anything we've done before.\" One of those outliers, titled \"The Edge of Perfection\", has a personal history for Benante: \"I had [it] way before COVID, and it has just stayed with me — the melody and the chords, but also the aggression.\" Want More Metal?
