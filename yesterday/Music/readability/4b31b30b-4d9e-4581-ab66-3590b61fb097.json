  "text": "Just 12 days before the 2024 US Presidential Election, Bruce Springsteen has once again voiced his support for Kamala Harris, appearing at a rally in Atlanta alongside the likes of Barack Obama, Samuel L Jackson, Spike Lee, Tyler Perry, and more to mobilize supporters of the Vice President’s campaign. Taking the rally stage donning an acoustic guitar and harmonica, Springsteen jumped straight into a rendition of his song “The Promised Land.” Then, switching guitars, he introduced himself and explained why he supports Harris, and opposes her opponent Donald Trump. Get Bruce Springsteen Tickets Here “I want a president who reveres the constitution,” he said. “Who does not threaten, but wants to protect and guide our great democracy. Who believes in the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power. Who will fight for a woman’s right to choose. Who wants to create a middle class economy that will serve all our citizens. There is only one candidate in this election who holds those principles dear: Kamala Harris.” Continuing, Springsteen said “[Harris] is running to be the 47th president of the United States. Donald Trump is running to be an American tyrant. He does not understand this country, its history, or what it means to be deeply American. That’s why, on November 5th, I’m casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. I urge all of you who believe in the American way to join me.” Springsteen then played “Land of Hope and Dreams,” after which he said “Now it’s time for some entertainment” and launched a rendition of his 1984 hit “Dancing in the Dark.” Watch video clips of Springsteen’s appearance below. As for the other speakers, Jackson and Lee kicked things off, both giving brief speeches expressing their excitement for Harris’ campaign. “She’s running on a vision to lead our country forward,” Jackson said. “A vision built on hope, built on faith, built on opportunity, and built on the belief that we can build a brighter future by lifting each other up and not tearing each other down.” Springsteen’s appearance at the rally follows his endorsement of Harris earlier this month by way of a quintessentially Springsteen-esque video message recorded in a New Jersey diner, in which he called Donald Trump the “most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.” Up next, he’ll perform at another Harris rally next Monday (October 28th) in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, when Election Day finally arrives, The Boss will be on the road for a run of Canadian tour dates, ending on November 22nd in Vancouver (get tickets). Next summer, he’ll hit the road again for a European tour with stops in the UK, France, Germany, and more countries. In other news, Springsteen isn’t the only musical artist who’s appearing at rallies in support of Harris — R.E.M.’s Michael Stipe and Jason Isbell performed at a rally earlier this month, as did Eminem when the Vice President spoke in Detroit this past week. Tomorrow, Beyoncé is even set to perform at a rally for Harris in Houston. \"I'm Bruce Springsteen and I'm here today to support Kamala Harris and Tim Waltz for president and vice president.
