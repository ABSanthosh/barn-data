  "text": "TikTok has confirmed plans to shut down if the Supreme Court doesn’t halt a law aimed at forcing a ban on the video-sharing app in the United States before January 19th. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments over whether the potential ban violates the First Amendment from TikTok (and its users) and the Department of Justice this coming Friday, January 10th. In April 2024, President Joe Biden signed a bill pressuring TikTok to cut ties with its Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance or face a permanent ban within the US. Known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the law was passed to combat the perceived national security threat of the China-based ByteDance having access to TikTok’s data. President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated into office on January 20th, has filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court to delay hearing the case and give his administration more time to find a “political resolution.” Ironically, during his first term as president, Trump advocated for a ban on TikTok, citing its ties to China. However, during the 2024 presidential election, he appeared to reverse his stance, recognizing the app as an effective tool for reaching younger voters.
