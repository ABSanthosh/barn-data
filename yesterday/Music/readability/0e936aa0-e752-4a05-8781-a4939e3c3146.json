  "text": "Sia has disclosed that she gave birth to her third child, Somersault Wonder Bernard, last year. The father of her child is Daniel Bernard, her now-separated husband, from whom she is pursuing a divorce. The singer kept her pregnancy private, but the child’s existence was revealed in divorce papers between Sia and Bernard, which were obtained by The Associated Press. The couple married in December 2022, and the singer filed for divorce last week, citing to “irreconcilable differences.” She is asking for sole custody of Somersault, who is celebrating his first birthday next Thursday. Sia also stipulated that the court provides no alimony to Bernard. In 2019, Sia told Vogue Australia that she adopted her first children, two 18-year-old boys at the time, after seeing them in a documentary about children aging out of foster care on television. She had expressed interest in becoming a foster parent in that same interview. Sia’s latest album, Reasonable Woman, was released in 2023. Earlier this month, the singer provided vocals to David Guetta’s new song “Beautiful People.”",
