Steve Hudson sifts through what remains of his living room on January 21, 2025 in Altadena, California. Multiple wildfires which were fueled by intense Santa Ana Winds have burned across Los Angeles County leaving at least 27 dead with over 180,000 people having been under evacuation orders or warning. Over 14,000 structures have burned in the Palisades and Eaton Fires, with Santa Ana Winds fueling new fires. Brandon Bell/Getty Images As wildfires continue to threaten Los Angeles amid dangerous “red flag” conditions, the boutique bank Raine has announced that its Grammy Week event will be reframed as a fundraiser for music professionals affected by the massive Palisades and Eaton blazes. The event, to be held on Jan. 30 at the San Vicente Bungalows in West Hollywood from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m., will be co-hosted by Raine, the National Music Publishers’ Association, and music industry publications Music Business Worldwide and HITS. Donations will go to the Recording Academy and MusiCares’ Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort supporting music workers impacted by the disasters. Those interested in attending are being asked to donate a minimum of $250, which can be done at the event’s RSVP page. Questions can be directed to wildfirefundraiser@raine.com. Raine partner Fred Davis says they chose to turn the event into a fundraiser — rather than cancel it altogether — to make the most of the attendees’ “enormously charitable” nature. “So many in our music community have been devastated by their losses. It hurts,” Davis tells Billboard. “I have grown up in this industry. I have a responsibility to help.” The Raine event would have been the music and entertainment industry-focused bank’s second Grammy Week cocktail party, but invitations went out one day before the Palisades Fire broke out on Jan. 7. That blaze went on to destroy more than 6,600 buildings and homes across more than 23,000 acres, while 11 people lost their lives. The Eaton Fire, which started later the same day in Altadena, is estimated to have destroyed more than 9,000 structures and killed 17. Both of those fires continue to burn but are nearing full containment, though a newer blaze, the Hughes Fire, exploded on Wednesday (Jan. 22) north of L.A. and prompted widespread evacuations in the Castaic Lake region. It has since burned more than 10,000 acres and is at 24% containment. Notably, the Raine event is one of the few to remain on the Grammy Week calendar in the wake of the wildfires, with the majority of the major bashes either canceled or postponed. Those that remain, including the annual MusiCares Person of the Year and Clive Davis Galas put on by the Recording Academy, have similarly been re-spun as fundraisers for wildfire relief. The Grammys themselves, which are still scheduled to be held on Feb. 2 at Crypto.com arena in Downtown Los Angeles, will go forward, according to academy, “with a renewed sense of purpose: raising additional funds to support wildfire relief efforts and honoring the bravery and dedication of first responders who risk their lives to protect ours.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
