  "text": "Tyler, the Creator’s new album, CHROMAKOPIA, arrived this past week, and in its first few days, it was streamed enough to catapult the rapper to the No. 1 spot on the Spotify Top Artist chart, breaking a 698-day streak held by pop megastar, Taylor Swift. Now, Tyler is calling out the “racist” Swifties who have allegedly retaliated by trying to have him canceled for his old lyrics. The rapper addressed the circumstance on stage at his Halloween mini-concert in Boston, dubbed “30 Minutes of CHROMAKOPIA.” Donning his new look from the album artwork and standing atop a green CHROMAKOPIA-themed shipping container, he humorously lamented, “I got Swifties all mad at me with their racist ass.” Get Tyler, the Creator Tickets Here Continuing, Tyler teased the Swifties, saying he didn’t care about what they thought of the infamously irreverent content from his early days. “[They’re] bringing up old lyrics — bitch, go listen to ‘Tron Cat,’ I don’t give a fuck hoe,” he said, before baiting his haters further. “I don’t give a fuck bitch. They gonna bring out the old me.” Watch a clip of the moment below. Though Tyler’s usurping of Swift’s spot on the Spotify Top Artist chart is new, there’s always been a bit of tension between the rapper and Swifties, considering some of his earlier lyrics that explicitly mentioned her — like on the Goblin track “Fish,” when he raps “Tyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift’s slit.” Say what you will about angsty satire, Swifties don’t take lines like that very light-heartedly. Now, some Swifties have called on their comrades to purchase Halsey’s new album, The Great Impersonator, in an effort to give CHROMAKOPIA a run for its money, but that probably won’t do much to stop Tyler’s momentum. CHROMAKOPIA premiered on October 28th, and has already become the biggest debut for any hip-hop album in 2024. Tyler’s massive “CHROMAKOPIA World Tour” will kick off in February, with over 60 dates booked around the world. Get tickets here. As for Swift, she is set to wrap her historic “Eras Tour” later this year with dates in Toronto and Vancouver. Get tickets here.
