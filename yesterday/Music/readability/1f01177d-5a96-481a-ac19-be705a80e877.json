Mariah Carey attends the Apple Music 10th anniversary celebration on June 30, 2025 at Apple Music’s studio space in Culver City, Calif. Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Apple Music It’s not just a sweet, sweet fantasy: Mariah Carey‘s about to deliver something “Sugar Sweet.” The pop queen stepped into the kitchen to whip up a small taste of what’s to come for fans this weekend — in the form of a light, sugary song. Carey shared a short video of herself mixing batter at the kitchen counter on Saturday (July 19). In the social media clip catered for fans, she fixes her gaze on the camera with a knowing smile and mouths the lyrics to a new tune. Dressed in bubblegum pink, the star previews a sweet hook that has her singing, “Imma keep it nice, Imma keep it neat, Imma keep it sugar, Imma keep it sweet.” Trending on Billboard No release date or further details have emerged about “Sugar Sweet,” but assuming the single arrives soon, it’ll be the follow-up to “Type Dangerous,” which just got a remix EP release featuring collaborations with Big Sean, DJ Snake, Method Man and more. Both tracks would likely find a place on Carey’s as-yet-untitled 16th studio album. Fortunately for eager fans awaiting Carey’s first full-length studio project since 2018, the new album is ready to go when she’s ready to reveal it. “What is next? The album coming out. I don’t wanna tell too much about it because I just don’t want to reveal the whole thing. It’s finished,” she confirmed in an Apple Music interview last month. In that conversation, she also left a hint that “Sugar Sweet” was on the way, adding that “a second single is coming soon. I’m very excited about it. It’s very summery. I like the beat as well.” See Carey’s “Sugar Sweet” clip below. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
