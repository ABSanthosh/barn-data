  "text": "Timothée Chalamet pulled double duty as host and musical guest on last night’s episode of Saturday Night Live. The star of the Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown performed three of Dylan’s songs: “Tomorrow Is a Long Time,” and a medley of “Outlaw Blues” and “Three Angels.” The latter also featured keyboard accompaniment from James Blake. Chalamet appeared in sketches throughout the night as a bungee-jumping instructor, new barista-in-training, and the AI-generated podcast host. Watch his performances, opening monologue, and SNL promo video with cast member Sarah Sherman below.This is Chalamet’s third time hosting SNL, having previously appeared on the show in 2020 and 2023. For his portrayal of Dylan, he’s currently nominated for Best Actor at the 2025 Oscars, one of eight categories in which A Complete Unknown is eligible to win. Last year, leading up to the film’s release, he recreated the music video for Dylan’s “Subterranean Homesick Blues.”Saturday Night Live’s 50th season, which kicked off in September, has featured performances from Jelly Roll, Coldplay, Stevie Nicks, Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Mk.gee, Charli XCX, Shaboozey, Gracie Abrams, and Hozier. Last week’s musical guest was Glorilla; a host and musical guest for SNL’s February 15 episode, which will air a day before the show’s 50th anniversary special, have yet to be announced.Revisit Madison Bloom’s review of A Complete Unknown, “A Flimsy Slice of Bob Dylan,” on The Pitch.",
