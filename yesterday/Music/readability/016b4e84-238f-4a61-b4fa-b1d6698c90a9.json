  "text": "The queer pop trio will perform across Europe next springScissor Sisters are back. The queer pop group have reunited and announced plans for a European arena tour that will take place in 2025 – just in time to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their debut album. The shows are all scheduled in the spring, beginning on May 16 in Nottingham, England and ending on May 28 in Dublin, Ireland. Opening for Scissor Sisters at each concert is Alison Goldfrapp. Check out their full list of tour dates below.“It’s the 20th anniversary of our debut album, so it really feels like the right time to revisit all the intense excitement of that moment,” said lead singer Jake Shears. “I think the impetus for this reunion was really a YouTube screening of Scissor Sisters: Live at The O2 that happened during lockdown. I don't think I'd seen that show since it was filmed in 2007, but we were all kind of surprised by how great it was. And chatting with fans during the screening really brought back what a special moment it was for all of us.”The last Scissor Sisters album, Magic Hour, came out back in 2012. It was the group’s fourth studio album and followed Night Work. Afterwards, Shears went on to release solo music, and Scissor Sisters dropped the benefit song “SWERLK” with MNDR in 2017.Read about Scissor Sisters’ song “Take Your Mama” in “50 Songs That Define the Last 50 Years of LGBTQ+ Pride.”All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
