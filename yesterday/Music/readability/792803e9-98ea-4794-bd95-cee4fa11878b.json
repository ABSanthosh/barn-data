His YouTube channel is loaded with killer covers of songs from Slipknot, Gojira, Whitechapel, and more, all of which you can check out here. But his recent cover of Kublai Khan TX's \"Self-Destruct\" is making the rounds for entirely different reasons. Watch as this kid crushes \"Self-Destruct\" on guitar while (I assume) his brother shows off the sickest pit moves known to man in the background. It's only a matter of time until dudes are out there pirouetting in the pit. Want More Metal?
