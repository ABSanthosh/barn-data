  "text": "Paul McCartney has announced Wings: The Story of a Band on the Run, a new 528-page book chronicling the formation and adventures of his 1970s band Wings after the Beatles ended. Written by McCartney and featuring an introduction by editor Ted Widmer, the book comes out on Tuesday, November 4.Wings: The Story of a Band on the Run begins with the band’s founding in 1971—with Linda McCartney, Denny Laine, and Denny Seiwell—and is organized around their nine albums, including the 1973 staple Band on the Run, on through to their dissolution in 1981. Beyond tapping into his own memories, McCartney interviewed his former bandmates, family members, and key players of that era to properly revisit what defined Wings’ career. The book also includes 150 black-and-white and color photographs, many of which are previously unseen.“I’m so very happy to be transported back to the time that was Wings and relive some of our madcap adventures through this book,” stated McCartney. “Starting from scratch after the Beatles felt crazy at times. There were some very difficult moments and I often questioned my decision. But as we got better I thought, ‘OK this is really good.’ We proved Wings could be a really good band, to play to huge audiences in the same way the Beatles had and have an impact in a different way. It was a huge buzz.”Last year, Wings released a 50th anniversary edition of Band on the Run, as well as the much-bootlegged live studio album One Hand Clapping.
