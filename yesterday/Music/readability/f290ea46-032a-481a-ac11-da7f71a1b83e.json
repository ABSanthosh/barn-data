  "text": "Singer-songwriter Jensen McRae has unveiled her new song, “Savannah,” the latest single from her forthcoming album, I Don’t Know How But They Found Me! Stream it below. The tender exploration of moving on and rebuilding a life is accompanied by an artful music video, directed by Rena Johnson, that sees McRae wandering an empty church in a wedding veil. “There is an intersection in your college town with your name on it,” she sings in the opening of the song before revealing that she’s fallen in love with someone new. Even as the ghosts of her past swirl around her, she walks forward. Get Jensen McRae Tickets Here On “Savannah,” McRae affirms her distinct approach to songwriting, in which she skillfully blends specific and seemingly personal details with highly relatable premises. It follows the release of singles “Praying on Your Downfall” and “Massachusetts,” the latter of which received a boost after an acoustic performance of the track made the rounds on TikTok. All three songs will be included on I Don’t Know How But They Found Me! when it arrives on April 25th. Pre-orders are ongoing. In celebration of the new album, McRae will be embarking on a headlining tour in May. See the full list of dates below, and grab tickets here.
