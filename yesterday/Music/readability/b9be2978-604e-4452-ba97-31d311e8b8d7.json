  "text": "Pete Davidson showed off a new tattoo-less look during a surprise appearance on this weekend’s episode of Saturday Night Live. The former SNL cast member popped up during a musical number featuring episode host John Mulaney and much of the show’s cast. Sporting a short sleeve t-shirt, Davidson arms were noticeably bare of his once signature tattoos. At one point, Davidson had over 100 tattoos. He began the process of removing them in 2020 after growing tired of the number of hours it took to cover all of his ink on film sets. He also hoped that by removing his tattoos it would open the door for more acting opportunities. “I honestly never thought that I would get an opportunity to act and I love it a lot,” Davidson explained in a 2021 interview on Late Night with Seth Meyers. “It takes, like, three hours — you have to get there, like, three hours earlier — to cover all your tattoos. For some reason, people in movies, they don’t have them that much.” Over the summer, Davidson entered a rehab facility to for mental health treatment.",
