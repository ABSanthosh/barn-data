  "text": "Chimaira has slowly been coming back to life over the past few years. The band played two shows in 2023, a triple set aboard Headbangers Boat 2024 alongside an appearance at Inkcarceration 2024, and has a handful of 2025 festival dates that you can find below. So what about new music? Well that might be happening too. Chimaira just posted a captionless video on their social media that features some strange noises in the background. Someone in the comments noticed that the image has three big dots and 21 small dots, potentially meaning that whatever is coming will happen on 3/21 – March 21. Friday. The date that bands generally drop new songs. So we'll see what happens here, but color me potentially very fucking excited. Chimaira's 2025 live dates thus far are: 5/16 Milwaukee, WI Milwaukee Metal Fest5/18 Daytona Beach, FL Welcome To Rockville9/20 Louisville, KY Louder Than Life10/5 Sacramento, CA Aftershock Want More Metal?
