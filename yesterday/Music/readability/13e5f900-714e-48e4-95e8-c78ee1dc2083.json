  "text": "The star revealed that her own house was affected by the flames earlier this week. Mandy Moore at the Red Carpet for 'This is Us' Season 6 at Paramount Studios on Dec. 14, 2021 in Los Angeles. Michael Buckner Mandy Moore, one of the thousands of people who lost their homes as catastrophic fires continue to blaze across Los Angeles, is hitting back at critics who shamed her for posting a GoFundMe page for her in-laws whose home was also destroyed. Explore See latest videos, charts and news “Yesterday, my brother-in-law and sister-in-law Griff \u0026 Kit lost their home and everything they own in the Eaton Fire,” Moore explained in the caption. “With their first baby on the way in a matter of weeks, they need our support now more than ever. Griff is a touring musician and also lost his entire arsenal of drums/percussion he uses to make a living. It’s all so much. So many have asked how to help during this unimaginable and stressful time…Please consider donating and sharing to help them rebuild.” She then responded to people who indicated that she should just donate her own money to her in-laws, citing a Celebrity Net Worth statistic found online. “People questioning whether we’re helping out our own family or attributing some arbitrary amount of money Google says someone has is NOT helpful or empathetic,” Moore added. “Of course we are. Our buddy Matt started this GoFundMe and I’m sharing because people have asked how they can help them. We just lost most of our life in a fire too. Kindly F OFF. No one is forcing you to do anything.” See her post here. The campaign initially sought to raise $60,000 but has since raised $176,000 and counting. Moore has been sharing her personal experience amid the fires over the past week. “I love you, Altadena. Grateful for my family and pets getting out last night before it was too late (and endless gratitude to friends for taking us in and bringing us clothes and blankets),” she wrote on Wednesday (Jan. 8) alongside videos of her neighborhood, engulfed in smoke and flames. “Honestly, I’m in shock and feeling numb for all so many have lost, including my family. My children’s school is gone. Our favorite restaurants, leveled. So many friends and loved ones have lost everything too. Our community is broken but we will be here to rebuild together. Sending love to all affected and on the front lines trying to get this under control.” She posted another series of photos the next day, this time from her property, much of which destroyed. “We were able to park and walk up our street to bear witness to all the loss. Miraculously, the main part of our house is still standing,” she wrote. “For now. It’s not livable but mostly intact.” Moore continued, “Everyone we know lost everything. Every house on our street is gone. My in laws. My brother and sister in law- 6 weeks from welcoming their first baby. Our best friends. Feeling weird survivors guilt. We love this community and will do everything we can to help rebuild and support.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
