  "text": "A week after Benson Boone covered Queen‚Äôs ‚ÄúBohemian Rhapsody‚Äù at Coachella with special guest Brian May, the ‚ÄúBeautiful Things‚Äù singer reprised the moment for the festival‚Äôs second weekend‚Ä¶ but this time, instead of the real-life Brian May, Boone had another special guest: a cardboard cutout of Brian May. Perhaps poking fun at the crowd for their lackluster response to the legendary guitarist at the first weekend, Boone teased prior to the song, ‚ÄúJust wait till you see who I bring up for ‚ÄòBohemian Rhapsody‚Äô today.‚Äù Get Benson Boone Tickets Here Then, once the tune began, things started the same way they did the week prior ‚Äî Boone, draped in a cape, sang the intro and did yet another flip off his piano. But as he got to the line ‚ÄúI sometimes wish I‚Äôd never been born at all‚Äù and turned to greet the special guest platform rising from beneath the stage, the only person ‚Äî err, thing ‚Äî on it was the life-size May replica. ‚ÄúBrian May!‚Äù Boone energetically shouted, pointing at the cutout as real-life guitarist Sus Vasquez skillfully delivered the guitar solo in May‚Äôs absence. Later in the song, Boone brought the cutout down from the platform to the main stage where his band was set up, placing it on top of his piano at one point and, ultimately, putting his arm around it for the song‚Äôs tender conclusion. Watch a video of the performance below. Later in the set, Boone told the audience, ‚ÄúI would like to let you all know, on Brian‚Äôs behalf, he would‚Äôve loved to have been here, but he unfortunately had to fly out so, we came up with that idea and he sends his love.‚Äù May‚Äôs appearance at Coachella weekend one marked a return to the stage after he suffered a stroke last year, temporarily losing the ability to use his left arm. On social media this week, he expressed his excitement at participating in the set, saying Boone ‚Äúgave us all a gift‚Äù and sharing fan-made recreation videos. Up next, Boone will perform at several other festivals this summer, including Governors Ball, Bourbon \u0026 Beyond, and more (get tickets). He also announced on-stage at Coachella that his sophomore album, American Heart, will arrive on June 20th via Night Street/Warner.
