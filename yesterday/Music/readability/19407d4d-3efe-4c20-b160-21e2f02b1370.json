  "text": "The highly-anticipated Bob Dylan biopic, A Complete Unknown, is finally set to premiere next week on December 25th, and for those who are looking for the perfect thing to wear to theaters, Levi’s has unveiled a new clothing collection inspired by the film. Dubbed “Levi’s Vintage Clothing x A Complete Unknown,” the collection includes a jacket and pair of jeans inspired by the costumes of star — and Consequence’s Film Performer of the Year — Timothée Chalamet, modeled after real clothing Dylan wore during his early years. The jacket, which is listed for $1,200 on Levi’s website, comes in a yellow-tanish color called “Dig Yourself Brown,” and is made of 100% leather. Those who purchase it will receive it in a special package, which will also contain sheet music for “A Hard Rain’s a-Gonna Fall,” a replica cue card from the “Subterranean Homesick Blues” video, a movie still of Chalamet wearing the jacket, and “costume notes on the inside pocket calling out A Complete Unknown as well as noting the outfit change and scene the product is featured in.” The pants —listed for $495 — come with a limited-edition belt with a D-shaped buckle, as well as sheet music for “Girl from the North Country,” another “Subterranean Homesick Blues” cue card, and a typed note in the watch pocket that quotes Dylan, reading, “I’ll let you be in my dreams, if I can be in yours.” In a post on Levi’s website, the costume designer for A Complete Unknown, Arianne Phillips, described how the collaboration came together. “While researching costumes for the film, I kept noticing that Bob Dylan wore Levi’s consistently throughout his career, both on and off stage,” she said. “So I worked with Paul O’Neill at Levi’s to help me source original Levi’s denim and produce the bootcut 501 jeans, as well as recreate the Super Slim Levi’s jeans that Dylan wore in ‘65… To my surprise and delight, I found that Dylan’s journey could be authentically traced through his Levi’s.” One notable feature of the Dylan-inspired jeans is the inclusion of a panel on each leg that, in real life, were sewn into the singer’s pants by his then-girlfriend, Suze Rotolo, so that he could wear the pants with boots. “It was exciting to reproduce Dylan’s original jeans with the inserted panel and include unique ephemera in the presentation, ensuring our new collection captures the film’s romantic themes while faithfully recreating the iconic Levi’s look of an unparalleled genius,” O’Neill said. Check out images of the products below. A Complete Unknown is directed by James Mangold, and was first announced in January 2020. Earlier this month, Dylan — who provided Mangold with notes on the film — gave the project his stamp of approval on Twitter, praising Chalamet as a “brilliant actor.”",
