  "text": "According to a report from TMZ back in January, online personality and music journalist Matt Pinfield suffered a \"massive stroke\" earlier that same month. The report noted that Pinfield's daughter Jessica filed for a temporary conservatorship over Matt as she sorts out his finances and makes decisions on his health. However, now there's some good news as The Hollywood Reporter is now reporting Pinfield is out of a coma. According to Pinfield himself, he was unresponsive for two months and was tragically on the verge of death. \"Guys, I'm alive,\" said Pinfield. \"I'm recovering and am going to come back swinging. I was unresponsive for two months. Friends were thinking they were coming to see me for the last time. The doctors never expected me to speak or to walk again.\" Upon regaining some consciousness, Pinfield said his friends told him he immediately wouldn't stop talking about music. Which in this case is great news: \"My friends said I went on about 'A Whiter Shade of Pale' and how they couldn't keep up with what I was saying. They were, like, 'Yeah, he's still got that brain.'\" Pinfield later noted that he hopes to be out of the hospital by the end of the month. \"I'm definitely going to take some time to recover. Then I'll do my radio shows again and get back to work doing what I love, which is to entertain people playing music.\" Pinfield's presence in the rock and metal world has been extensive and well-documented over the past few decades. Pinfield hosted MTV's 120 Minutes alongside a slew of other specials on the channel in the '90s, and in 2001 becae the Vice President of A \u0026 R and Artist Development for Columbia Records. Pinfield later hosted VH1's VSpot Top 20 Countdown, has DJ'ed on SiriusXM Radio, and countless others. We wish Pinfield all the best with his health at this time. Want More Metal?
