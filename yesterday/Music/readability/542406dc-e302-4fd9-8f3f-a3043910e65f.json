  "text": "Thursday are closing out 2024 with another new song. Following the April comeback track “Application for Release From the Dream,” they’ve now released “White Bikes,” along with a black-and-white video created by Duran Levinson and Nick Scholey. Watch the video for the new song below.Thursday recorded “White Bikes” in June at Hansa Tonstudio, the Berlin, Germany, studio where David Bowie made “Heroes” and Iggy Pop made Lust for Life. “This is our gift to you this holiday season. We hope you love it as much as we do,” the band shared. “White Bikes started with an idea from [guitarist] Norman Brannon, and you can hear his distinctive style all over this song. [Bassist] Stuart Richardson had the idea to produce the track like a nostalgic, upbeat, summertime version of War All the Time. [Singer] Geoff [Rickly] told us that the lyrics deal with the loss of a dear friend — one of the first people he ever played music with — who disappeared one day on his bike. This one means a lot to us for a lot of different reasons.”Thursday have not released a new studio album since April 2011’s No Devolución.",
