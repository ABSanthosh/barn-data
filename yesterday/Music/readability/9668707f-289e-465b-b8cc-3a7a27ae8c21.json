  "text": "Update: As I Lay Dying has issued a brief statement noting that Shaped By Fire has disappeared due to the end of a licensing agreement, and that they'll let fans know what's going on with the band soon. \"Sorry for the temporary inconvenience of Shaped By Fire not being available on streaming services,\" wrote As I Lay Dying on their Instagram. \"We had a 5 year distribution deal that has been fulfilled and the album has reverted back to being owned by the band. It will be put back online, but we just need a moment for the processing to take place. \"Beyond that, we are still sorting through details of what is going on within AILD and will have more details for you soon.\" Original story: It's been a week of mystery surrounding As I Lay Dying, and now there's another layer to the whole thing! As pointed out by The PRP, As I Lay Dying's 2019 comeback album Shaped By Fire has largely disappeared from the Internet. It's not on Bandcamp and it's not on streaming services anymore. It's just gone. Much like everything else surrounding As I Lay Dying right now, the band has not offered a comment on the disappearance. Shaped By Fire was released on Nuclear Blast and was As I Lay Dying's first album since vocalist Tim Lambesis was released from jail after trying to hire a hitman to kill his wife Meggan Murphy in 2013. Shaped By Fire featured guitarists Nick Hipa and Phil Sgrosso, bassist Josh Gilbert, and Jordan Mancino – only Sgrosso remains at the moment, and even that might not be true. To recap how this all went down – first to leave was bassist Ryan Neff with barely any statement, and then their tour manager quit amidst rumors that As I Lay Dying's European tour was cancelled. Guitarist then Ken Susi then quit the band saying his \"personal morals have recently been tested to a breaking point,\" followed immediately by drummer Nick Pierce quitting and saying he needs to \"distance myself from the band in an effort to retain my personal health and integrity.\" Oh, and the European tour did get cancelled, but As I Lay Dying didn't break the news.
