  "text": "Ted Lasso’s Brett Goldstein has finally confirmed a popular fan theory: That the Apple TV+ hit was directly inspired by The Wizard of Oz. “Oh yeah, there’s loads and loads of The Wizard of Oz in Ted Lasso,” Goldstein told Entertainment Weekly. “The pinball machine is the one that’s always ‘Ted has to go home. There’s no place like home.’ And then, there’s no place like Richmond F.C. Yes, that’s all Wizard of Oz.” It doesn’t stop there — according to Goldstein, who served as a writer for the show in addition to playing aging footballer Roy Kent, the show’s characters were directly inspired by the L. Frank Baum classic. “I’m the Tin Man, Ted is Dorothy, Rebecca’s the Lion, and the Scarecrow is Jamie [Tartt],” he said. “I’m sure this is going to cause a lot of trouble.” It’s fitting that many Ted Lasso fans felt that The Wizard of Oz was a big inspiration point — after all, Ted Lasso himself is from Kansas, the show’s penultimate episode featured the aforementioned Wizard of Oz-themed pinball machine, plus numerous details and easter eggs that fans have noticed throughout the show’s three-season run. While Ted Lasso concluded back in spring 2023, a new season was reported to be in the works from Apple TV+ back in August, with the core cast set to return. Though an official deal hasn’t been announced with co-creator and star Jason Sudekis, Apple TV+ is reportedly hoping to begin production on season four of Ted Lasso in early 2025. Meanwhile, Goldstein’s other Apple TV+ project Shrinking just unveiled their second season. Catch up on Season 1 or check out past episodes of Ted Lasso on Apple TV+ here.",
