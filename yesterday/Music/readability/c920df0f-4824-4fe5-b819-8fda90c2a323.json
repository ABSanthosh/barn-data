  "text": "Relapse Records has announced a massive 25th anniversary reissue of Cave In's Jupiter record due out January 10. For those unaware, Jupiter came out in 2000 and was a massive departure from their 1998 debut album Until Your Heart Stops. Jupiter is available as a standalone LP, as well as a deluxe 2xCD and 3xLP box set, all remastered by James Plotkin. The 2xCD includes the full album alongside a special live set recorded for broadcast on Boston's legendary rock radio station WBCN in October of 2000. Then there's a deluxe 3xLP boxset that includes the Jupiter demos and the WBCN radio session. Pre-orders are available here. “Sometime in the late 90's, I had a seed of an idea: to make a record called Jupiter – the largest planet in our solar system, but also a failed star,\" said Cave In frontman Stephen Brodsky. \"The combination of those things was ripe with inspiration. Plus the combination of individuals in our band had crystallized to form a new pathway forward, and down that path we went – loud and proud! \"Fast forward 25 years and Relapse has truly outdone themselves with an incredible reissue that fully encapsulates our cosmic youth, proving yet again their unparalleled mastery in the game of heavy music preservation. Also exciting news: Roadburn 2025 will be the first time we've ever played this collection of sonic spacedust in full, and we're beyond grateful for the opportunity.\" Want More Metal?
