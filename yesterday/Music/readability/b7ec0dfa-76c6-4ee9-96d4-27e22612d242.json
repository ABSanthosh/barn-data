  "text": "Billie Eilish announced at her concert in Manchester, UK, on Saturday that she’s collaborating with filmmaker James Cameron on “something very special” in 3D. “You may have noticed more cameras than usual… I can’t say much about it, but I can say we’re working on something very special with someone name James Cameron that’s going to be in 3D,” Eilish shared with the audience. While details remain under wraps, logic suggests the collaboration could be a 3D concert film documenting Eilish’s ongoing “Hit Me Hard and Soft: The Tour.” A representative for Eilish confirmed that more information will be shared in the coming months. Eilish will bring the “Hit Me Hard and Soft: The Tour” back to North America for a run of fall arena shows beginning in October. Meanwhile, Cameron’s latest Avatar film, Avatar: Fire and Ash, is set to hit theaters on December 19th, 2025.",
