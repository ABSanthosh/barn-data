  "text": "The singer also spoke about her recent partnership with Smirnoff ICE Rashida Zagon For the last few months, Majo Aguilar has been busy working on new music, a tour and partnerships like her team-up with Smirnoff ICE — and it’s only going to get busier in the coming months. Explore See latest videos, charts and news “A new song will be released every month, and by April, the complete album will be out,” the singer told Billboard of her next studio album, Mariachi Tumbado. A cover of Belanova’s 2003 single “Aún Así Te Vas” dropped in late September and serves as the collection’s lead single, but it just so happens to be a Mariachi Tumbado version. “It’s mariachi music interpreted in the traditional way, but with the addition of laying down instruments. It’s experimental, and I’m really happy with it because it took months of work to make it sound authentic and heartfelt. I’m excited to share something that I love creating so much.” In addition to the monthly appetizers of music, Aguilar is currently on the road and up for two nominations at the 2024 Latin Grammys, a recognition that she called “a tremendous source of pride.” Among her nominations include Best Ranchero/Mariachi Album for Mariachi y Tequila (Deluxe) and Best Regional Mexican Song for “Canción Para Olvidarte.” Trending on Billboard “It’s the community of artists, composers, arrangers, and engineers who are supporting your project and taking notice of it. Honestly, sometimes I don’t even think about it. For me, the nomination itself is already the ultimate award,” she explained. “Plus, I’m nominated alongside great artists like Mariachi Sol de México, mi tío Pepe [Aguilar] and Alejandro Fernández. So, if I win, it’ll be absolutely crazy. But definitely, for me — and I mean this from the bottom of my heart — having the nomination is a tremendous award, isn’t it?” Just a few weeks back, she also delivered a show-stopping performance as part of the 35-year celebration of Billboard Latin Music Week in Miami. The Billboard En Vivo concert event was sponsored by Smirnoff ICE and arrived on the heels of her partnership with the brand. The team-up also saw her shine a spotlight on her culture in an accompanying “Cultura a Tu Manera” video series. “For me, it was a very important and special collaboration because I think culture gives us roots. Culture gives us a sense of belonging. Latinos in the world always yearn for our culture and we like to feel connected to it,” Aguilar explained of the three-part video series. “We want to feel that there are many people around us who also connect with our culture. Food, music and style are key pieces of a culture that show who we are and where we come from. So, I felt that this was a very intimate campaign, and I really enjoyed doing it.” Click here for more on Aguilar’s participation, including her appearance on The Legacies panel, during Billboard Latin Music Week!
