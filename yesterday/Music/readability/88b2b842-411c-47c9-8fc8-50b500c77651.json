  "text": "After a successful tour, the Mexican indie pop trio is \"so excited\" to be playing this summer at the iconic festival in Chicago. Latin Mafia @directony Latin Mafia will cap off their first international tour, Te Odio y Te Extraño Mucho (I Hate and Miss You So Much), with a summer performance at the iconic Lollapalooza festival in Chicago, where they will close out the shows on The Grove stage on Aug. 3. “We’re just so excited; it’s the first time we’re closing a stage at such an important festival,” Milton de la Rosa, part of the Mexican indie-pop trio, tells Billboard Español. “When we went to Coachella [in 2024], we also just said, ‘Today is just another day doing what we love, another day doing what we were born to do.’” Their appearance at the U.S. festival — headlined this year by Olivia Rodrigo, Sabrina Carpenter, TWICE and Korn — marks the pinnacle of a successful concert season for brothers Mike de la Rosa and twins Milton and Emilio, who have seen their fanbase grow exponentially in Mexico and the U.S. over the last three years. Trending on Billboard The excitement they generate will also take them to the stages of another major music event this fall, Austin City Limits, where they will again share the lineup with Sabrina Carpenter, as well as Hozier, The Strokes, Doechii and Empire of the Sun, among others. In their home country, Latin Mafia has achieved previously unimaginable milestones, such as selling out three shows at Mexico City’s Palacio de los Deportes on May 31, June 1 and July 5, reaching 63,500 tickets sold, according to promoter OCESA. Months earlier, the trio — originally from the border city of Monterrey — held a free listening party for their 2024 debut album, TODOS LOS DÍAS TODO EL DÍA, at the same venue. “Five years ago, I came here to see Twenty One Pilots and waited in line for nine hours, and now we’ve done four shows here,” Emilio says excitedly. As one of the most original acts in the current Latin pop scene, Latin Mafia has won over fans with their emotional songs and fusion of rhythms such as pop, reggaeton, R\u0026B and trap. The Te Odio y Te Extraño Mucho tour included 38 concerts in just a few months, 17 of which sold out in the U.S. and 14 in Mexico, according to their promoters. The tour featured an innovative 360-degree stage setup with screens and closed-circuit cameras. At their May 31 show at the Palacio de los Deportes, guest stars included Spanish artist Rusowsky, Chilean singer Akrilla, and Guatemalan-American rapper Jesse Baez, who made another appearance at the July 5 show. Mexican-American artist Omar Apollo also performed and will release a duet with the band titled “Hecho Para Ti” on July 24. In addition to the thrill of hearing them live, the trio’s music racks up thousands of daily streams on digital platforms. Last weekend, the Mexican Association of Producers of Phonograms (Amprofon) awarded them a Platinum Record for “No Digas Nada” and four Gold Records for the songs “Flores,” “Se Fue La Luz,” “Siento Que Merezco Más,” and “Julieta.” “It’s overwhelming, but in another way, it’s also very exciting to think about what’s coming next,” says Milton de la Rosa. “We’ve been touring and performing for over half a year now, and it’ll end at some point. We’re eager to get lost again, in a way, because we’re hungry to decide where we’re going next.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
