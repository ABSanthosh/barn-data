  "text": "The pop singer was also nominated for new artist of the year at the fan-voted awards show. Benson Boone at the 2025 American Music Awards held at the Fontainebleau Las Vegas on May 26, 2025 in Las Vegas. Rich Polk Benson Boone took over the stage at the 2025 American Music Awards on Monday night (May 26) to perform his new single “Mystical Magical.” Wearing a patchwork purple suit glittering with rhinestones, the mustachioed musician kicked off his number by crooning, “There’s nothing colder than your shoulder/ When you’re dragging me along like you do, like you do/ And then you switch up with no warnin’/ And you kiss me like you want it/ How rude, how rude.” As the song ramped up, Boone performed one of his signature backflips on stage, upping the ante this time by impressively clearing an entire staircase of eight steps on the stage of the Fountainebleu Las Vegas. The gravity-defying move also happened to land him right in the front row, where he flirted with Nikki Glaser and Heidi Klum as he sang, “I know you’ll come around to me eventually/ If you sit back, relax and join my company/ Oh, baby, trust me.” The coy moment amusingly continued the singer’s recent history of awards show bits with the pair, who helped with the mid-performance reveal of his viral blue jumpsuit at the 2025 Grammys back in February. “Mystical Magical” serves as the second single off Boone’s upcoming sophomore album, American Heart, which will drop June 20 via Night Street and Warner Records. The LP also contains lead single “Sorry I’m Here for Someone Else” and the newly released “Momma Song.” During the telecast, Boone was up for his very first American Music Award for new artist of the year — a trophy that ultimately went to fellow pop sensation Gracie Abrams in a crowded field that also included Chappell Roan, Shaboozey, Teddy Swims and Tommy Richman. The American Music Awards are produced by Dick Clark Productions, which is owned by Penske Media Eldridge, a joint venture between Eldridge Industries and Billboard parent company Penske Media.
