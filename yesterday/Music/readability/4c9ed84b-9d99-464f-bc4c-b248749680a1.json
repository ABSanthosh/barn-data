  "text": "This morning, Deftones posted a statement to their social media, stating that they would no longer be performing at this year's Glastonbury festival. They were set to perform tonight at 8:30pm UK time. The announcement was made three hours ago through both Deftones and Glastonbury Festival. Deftones offered the following: \"In an unfortunate development, an illness in the band is going to prevent us from playing Glastonbury tonight. We’re devastated to be missing out on something we’ve been looking forward to for months, but sometimes circumstances out of our control interfere with things we want to do the most. We really hope to return to Glastonbury soon, and as it currently stands, we plan on seeing you tomorrow at Crystal Palace.\" Glastonbury offered a quick solution: \"Deftones have been forced to cancel tonight’s 8.30pm Other Stage performance due to illness in the band. Skepta will kindly step-in, taking the stage at 9pm. He says: ‘Let’s go!!! No crew, no production but am ready to shut Glastonbury down. Victory lap time. Pre-Big Smoke 2025!’ Ezra Collective’s set will now run from 7-8.15pm. We wish Deftones a speedy recovery.\" As it currently stands, about three hours after the statement was made, the band plans on continuing the rest of their European and UK tour. You can find the rest of the dates below. June 29th – London, UK @ Crystal Palace (feat. Weezer \u0026 High Vis)July 2nd – Roskilde, GEN @ Roskilde FestivalJuly 3rd – Werchter, BEL @ Rock WerchterJuly 4th – Aaras, FRA @ Main Square Festival Want More Metal?
