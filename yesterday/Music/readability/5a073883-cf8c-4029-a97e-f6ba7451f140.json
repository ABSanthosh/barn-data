Smith will kick things off October 6 in Dublin, with concerts dotted around Europe and the UK before heading to the States in November. Patti Smith and her band will then perform in Seattle, Oakland, San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Boston, and Washington, D.C., with a final gig in Philadelphia on November 29. Find the full itinerary below.Joining Smith on stage will be longtime guitarist Lenny Kaye and drummer Jay Dee Daugherty, both of whom recorded with Smith on the 1975 LP. Smith’s live band will also feature bassist and Keyboardist Tony Shanahan, and guitarist Jackson Smith, Patti’s son. Smith has played Horses’ full tracklist a handful of times throughout the years, notably in 2015 at New York’s Beacon Theatre, and in 2005, at London’s Meltdown Festival, which she curated that year.Revisit “At 71 Years Old, Patti Smith Is Still a Rock Star—And Thank God for That” on the Pitch.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
