  "text": "Amy Poehler and producer Mike Schur are teaming up again on the new comedy series Dig, which was picked up by Peacock on Wednesday. Poehler is set to star in the series, which is based on the 2023 novel Excavations by Kate Myers. Additional cast members have yet to be announced. Get Amy Poehler and Tina Fey Tickets Here “Four women working at an archeological dig in Greece are at wildly different crossroads in their lives,” reads the official logline. “When the team uncovers a long-buried secret with the potential to rewrite history, they find themselves at the center of a high-stakes international conspiracy.” Poehler and Schur will executive produce Dig and co-write the pilot. This is the latest NBC project reuniting former sitcom duos, following a new Tina Fey and Tracy Morgan comedy announced in March. This is Poehler and Schur’s first collaboration since Parks and Recreation, in which Poehler played one of her best-known characters: dedicated civil servant Leslie Knope. This year marks a decade since the series finale of Parks and Rec, which was co-written by Poehler and Schur. In the years since Parks and Rec, Poehler and Schur have worked on numerous other comedic projects. Poehler returned as the emotion Joy in Inside Out 2 last year. Meanwhile, Schur has created and written on sitcoms including The Good Place and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.  Poehler has been a vocal admirer of Excavations, the book on which Dig is based. She wrote a blurb for the book’s paperback edition, calling it “funny, smart, and deeply delicious.” Poehler also named it one of her favorite books that she read last year in an interview on Late Night with Seth Meyers. “It’s about women descending on an archeological dig site,” Poehler told Meyers. “I love the idea of digging things up, things being buried.” For fans of her standup comedy, Poehler has several dates left on her “Restless Leg Tour” with Tina Fey through the end of June.
