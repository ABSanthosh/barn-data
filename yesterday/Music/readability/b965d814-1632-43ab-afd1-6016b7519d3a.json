  "text": "Welcome back to Fan Chant, a weekly column for K-pop fans, stans, and newbies alike. This week, HEYOON checks in to discuss creating her new single, “ASAP” featuring Chris Patrick. If you enjoy what you’re reading, feel free to subscribe to my companion newsletter to get Fan Chant delivered right to your inbox each week! The past few years have been defined by exploration for soloist HEYOON. As a former member of global pop group Now United, the dancer and vocalist represented South Korea among a team that also included performers from Senegal, China, the UK, and Lebanon. Since departing the multi-national act, she’s begun to settle into her own artistry as an individual. Known for her powerful skill set as a dancer and choreographer even prior to her work with Now United, HEYOON used her new single “ASAP,” to embrace everything it means to take center stage, enlisting US rapper Chris Patrick for an added burst of energy. As the follow-up to her 2024 release, “Pivot” featuring Armani White, the track effectively continues the vibrant mood she’d established. “I feel so blessed for my experience in the group — it gave me the tools for what I want to do, and I hope I can touch even more people with my music,” she tells Consequence. Watch the dynamic video for “ASAP” below, and read on for HEYOON’s insights into the song and this chapter of her story. What felt fun and exciting to you about “ASAP?” Why did this feel like the right time for this release? “ASAP” carries a brave yet vulnerable message, but at the same time, sonically, it’s sexy and energetic. I love the song and I knew my fans would want to dance to this song as well! I’ve been a fan of Chris Patrick’s music and we had mutual friends; Chris is a super down to earth and talented artist, so it was so fun working with him. Something I love about the visual for this song is the commitment to inclusivity and expression. What do you love about the opportunities art affords in that department? Having diversity and inclusivity is not even a question for me when it comes to any of my projects. We are beautiful because of our individuality and I believe I’m a vessel to this world to help people realize that through my art and creativity. Music and art brings so much color into our lives! What was the filming experience like for the visual for “ASAP?” Do you have any favorite moments or behind the scenes experiences to share? Working with Geerten Harmens, the director of the video, was such a pleasure. We kept dancing throughout filming. Also, having Chris fly all the way to Korea — everyone had so much fun and had positive energy on set. I’m so grateful for the whole crew. With your background in group settings, how has this chapter felt as a soloist? What are some of your goals as you continue to release songs under your name alone? I’m really present and locked in these days. There have been lots of changes in the best way! I feel so blessed for my experience in the group — it gave me the tools for what I want to do, and I hope I can touch even more people with my music! Where have you been feeling inspiration lately?  A lot of my inspirations come from conversations, but lately I’ve been watching back on all the iconic music videos from the ’90s \u0026 2000s . I love going back to my childhood inspirations and creating things that’ll make the “little me” happy. Airline Employee Who Allegedly Sold K-Pop Artist Flight Information In case you missed it, HYBE has commented on the ongoing case involving a Hong Kong-based airline employee who allegedly profited from searching up and sharing travel information about a number of K-pop idols, including BTS. Read the update here. Song Rec of the Week: I’m not sure why this song is having a moment on socials, but what a bop! Any fans of this group are welcome to send some more recs over. I love the chorus.",
