  "text": "The Rolling Stones’ Hackney Diamonds served as the legendary group’s first original album together in 18 years, and now, it’s a Grammy winner. At the Premiere Ceremony for the 2025 Grammy Awards, The Rolling Stones took home the award for Best Rock Album, marking their first Grammy win since 2018 and their second time winning the category overall. They had quite the competition in the Best Rock Album category this year, beating out Pearl Jam’s Dark Matter, Green Day’s Saviors, The Black Crowe’s Happiness Bastards, IDLES’ Tangk, Jack White’s No Name, and one of our favorite albums of 2024, Fontaines D.C.’s Romance. The Grammys had already shown their love for Hackney Diamonds in last year’s ceremony, with lead single “Angry” scoring a Best Rock Song nomination. Their win tonight is their fourth Grammy Award out of 14 total nominations, plus a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987 and multiple Grammy Hall of Fame additions. The band completed their tour in support of Hackney Diamonds last year, but you can revisit our photo gallery and recap of their 2024 show at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey here. You can find our full coverage of the 2025 Grammy Awards here.",
