  "text": "Disturbed vocalist David Draiman is currently embroiled in a legal battle with his landlord. According to a report from Law360 (via The PRP), Draiman filed a lawsuit against his landlord on March 11, 2025 for misrepresenting the condition of the house he was renting. The suit notes that Draiman was renting a 6 bedroom, 5,200 square foot in Coral Gables, FL for $18,500 a month. Which like… just buy a house for that price, man. Anyway, Draiman claims that the landlord did not disclose leaks and mold that he's since found on the property. Draiman alleges he confronted the landlord about fixing the issue, but the issues were never fixed. Draiman said the issues eventually caused him to move off the property as the mold \"impacts [Draiman's] ability to sing as he is lead singer of a prominent rock band with tour dates and recording time and fully advised defendant of the same.\" The suit continues: \"The uninhabitability and mold concerns, among others, resulted in impacts to plaintiff's singing career, recording and studio time with medical concerns.\" Draiman is asking for his $37,000 security deposit back and is accusing the landlord of \"engaging in fraudulent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, and negligence.\" Between this and Disturbed accidentally messing up the Chicago Bulls' banners at a recent show, Draiman has been having a pretty shitty month.
