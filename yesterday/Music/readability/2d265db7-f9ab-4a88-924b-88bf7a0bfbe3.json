  "text": "Wilco have announced the return of their destination music festival Sky Blue Sky. In its first iteration since 2023, the five-day event will take place January 15-19 at the Hard Rock Hotel in Riviera Maya, Mexico. Jeff Tweedy and his band are set to perform three times throughout the long weekend, alongside sets from Waxahatchee, MJ Lenderman \u0026 the Wind, Cameron Winter, and others. Check out the full lineup and festival poster below.“Every time we are asked to help curate one of these festivals it feels like a dream opportunity to gather up our families, invite some friends, old and new, and sing some songs by the sea,” Tweedy said in a press statement. “Truly a hard thing to argue with in terms of a good time. Want to join us? We hope you can. We’d love to see you. You might even see one of us in shorts. Not likely, but it’s your best shot.”Sky Blue Sky 2023 featured performances from Father John Misty, Lucinda Williams, and Cate Le Bon. That year, Wilco also shared their latest studio album, the Le Bon–produced Cousin. Since then, the band released the EP Hot Sun Cool Shroud and, in February, reissued 2004’s A Ghost Is Born. Wilco are currently on tour in Europe and will return to North America for a run of U.S. and Canadian dates this August.Read about Wilco’s Summerteeth at No. 102 in “The 150 Best Albums of the 1990s,” and revisit Jayson Greene’s column “The Anti-Nostalgia of Wilco’s Yankee Hotel Foxtrot Anniversary Shows.”Sky Blue Sky 2026The Autumn DefenseCameron WinterCase OatsDr. DogHow Long Gone (Live Podcast)Hurray for the Riff RaffThe JayhawksJeff TweedyMichael Shannon \u0026 Jason Narducy \u0026 Friends Play R.E.M.MJ Lenderman \u0026 the WindValerie JuneWaxahatcheeWilcoYo La Tengo",
