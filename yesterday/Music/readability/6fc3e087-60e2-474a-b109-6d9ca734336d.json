  "text": "Caroline Polachek has shared a cover of Radiohead’s “True Love Waits,” recorded live in the presence of Claude Monet’s “Water Lilies” at Musée de l’Orangerie in Paris, France. Standing in front of the iconic paintings and armed with a small sound system and mic stand, Polachek delivered a stirring rendition of the song, cooly crooning the meditative melody over a shifting bed of synth chords. Posting a video of the performance on Instagram, she likened the track — which had a 20-year journey between being written and finally being recorded for Radiohead’s 2016 album, A Moon Shaped Pool — to Monet’s “Water Lilies” themselves. “‘True Love Waits,’ like the ‘Water Lilies,’ went through decades of versions and distillations… through time and loss and perseverance,” she wrote. “I had chills all over to sing in that room, while seeing those paintings IRL for the first time.” Watch the video of the performance below. Earlier this year, Polachek released a deluxe version of her 2023 album, Desire, dubbed the Everasking Edition. In May, she dropped the single “Starburned and Unkissed,” from the soundtrack to the A24 film I Saw the TV Glow. As for Radiohead, it was announced this past September that frontman Thom Yorke has reworked the band’s 2003 album, Hail to the Thief, for a stage production of Hamlet. That aside, Jonny Greenwood recently confirmed that the band has “no plans” for 2025.",
