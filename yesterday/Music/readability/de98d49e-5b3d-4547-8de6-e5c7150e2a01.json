  "text": "Bruno Mars, who definitely doesn’t owe tens of millions of dollars in gambling debts to MGM Resorts, forcing him to play a life-long residency at their venues, has once again extended his residency at Dolby Live at Park MGM. The newly announced dates span a total of nine shows taking place in August (22, 23, 26, 27, 30, 31) and September (3, 5, 6). A Live Nation ticket pre-sale is set Thursday, May 1st at 10:00 a.m. local time via Ticketmaster (use code DANCE), with a public on-sale following on Friday, May 2nd, also at 10:00 a.m. local time. Get Bruno Mars Tickets Here Mars first launched his residency at Park MGM in 2016 and has since performed more than 100 shows at the Las Vegas casino and its sister venues over the past nine years. There have been unsubstantiated rumors — which MGM has flatly denied — suggesting that his long-running residency is tied to an alleged gambling debt he is still working to pay off. For his part, Mars declined to address the rumors in an interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal last year, saying, “Absolutely not! I love the lore that I am a Las Vegas lounge singer in debt to the mob. I can work with that.” Mars has several previously announced shows at Park MGM scheduled in May and June; tickets for those dates are available here. Bruno Mars at Dolby Live at Park MGM: May 21st May 24th May 25th May 28th May 30th May 31st June 2nd August 22nd August 23rd August 26th August 27th August 30th August 31st September 3rd September 5th September 6th",
