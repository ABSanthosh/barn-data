  "text": "Madonna’s “Like a Prayer” rises even higher in the top 10. Will she be No. 1? Keep watching to find out! Narrator: Christmas hits slip while classics climb up the chart. The choir version of Madonna’s “Like a Prayer” rises to No. 1 on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 for the chart posting December 19th. The angelic anthem reached the top spot thanks to the Pepe Muppet trend. Our next throwback hit is “Paper Planes” by M.I.A. The 2008 hit made a massive jump from 21 to 2 thanks to a dance trend. Frank Ocean’s 2016 song “White Ferrari” is at No. 6 this week after sitting outside the top 10 last week. It’s attached to a trend where users explain a fantasy situation they wish was real. Mariah surprisingly slips to 8 as we approach Christmas, even though she’s matching her own record over on the Hot 100. Our only new hit of the week to break into the top 10 is “Wander On” by Jeddy Knox. Every Thursday, Billboard will bring you the verified list of the hottest songs on TikTok by monitoring music discovery and engagement on the platform in the United States.
