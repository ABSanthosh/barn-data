  "text": "Bob Dylan has announced his initial batch of 2025 tour dates, featuring a handful of stops in small towns across the midwest. Billed as a continuation of his “Rough and Rowdy Ways Tour,” the brief run kicks off on March 25th with a previously announced show in Tulsa, Oklahoma (get tickets here), and continues on with dates in Wichita, Kansas; Mankato, Minnesota; and Green Bay, Wisconsin. See the full details below. Get Bob Dylan Tickets Here Tickets for the Minnesota show go on sale Friday, January 31st via Ticketmaster, with the Wichita and Green Bay dates available through AXS on the same day. As Rolling Stone notes, Mankato has a population of 46,000, making it the 21st-largest city in Dylan’s home state. As such, the show’s venue, Mayo Clinic Health Systems Event Center, has previously hosted events like a Johnny Cash tribute show, a local lip sync battle, and a pork industry trade show. In other Dylan news, he recently joined TikTok. Last week, the Timothée Chalamet-starring biopic A Complete Unknown received a bevy of Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Chalamet. Chalamet himself appeared on SNL this past weekend, where he covered a few Dylan deep cuts, including “Three Angels” and “Tomorrow Is a Long Time.” Bob Dylan 2025 Tour Dates: 03/25 – Tulsa, OK @ Tulsa Theater 03/29 – Wichita, KS @ Century II Concert Hall 04/04 – Mankato, MN @ Mayo Clinic Health Systems Event Center 04/06 – Green Bay, WI @ The Weidner-Cofrin Family Hall",
