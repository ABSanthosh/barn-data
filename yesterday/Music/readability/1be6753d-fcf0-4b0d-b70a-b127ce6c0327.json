  "text": "Note: This article contains references to alleged sexual assault that some readers may find disturbing.Sean “Diddy” Combs has been sued for sexual assault by five more people, including one woman who alleges that, in 2000, she was drugged and raped by the disgraced rapper and another celebrity when she was 13 years old, according to documents viewed by Pitchfork. All plaintiffs are suing for compensatory damages for physical injuries and emotional distress, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and more. In addition to those five lawsuits, filed in a New York federal court, two more John Does filed cases against Diddy in New York State Supreme Court.The first Jane Doe alleges that, around September 7, 2000, when she was 13 years old, a friend dropped her off at New York’s Radio City Music Hall to try to attend the MTV Video Music Awards. In an attempt to get into an afterparty, the plaintiff approached limousine drivers and struck a conversation with one who claimed he worked for Diddy. According to the lawsuit, the driver allegedly told her that Diddy “liked younger girls and said she ‘fit what Diddy was looking for.’” Doe claims the driver brought her to a large white house filled with celebrities where two men asked her to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA), but did not give her a copy of the document.Jane Doe allegedly accepted one drink from waitstaff, felt woozy, and found an empty bedroom to “lie down for a moment” in private. “Soon after, Combs, along with a male and female celebrity, entered the room,” reads the lawsuit. Doe claims that Diddy “threw” her toward the male celebrity, who removed her clothes and raped her while the others watched. Then, she alleges, Diddy raped her while the two celebrities watched. When Diddy allegedly attempted to force her to perform oral sex, she claims she hit him in the neck, grabbed her clothes, and left the bedroom, “roaming naked through the house looking for the exit as the party continued.” The lawsuit states that, once outside, she got dressed, walked until she found a gas station, and called her father to ask for help.In a different lawsuit, a 29-year-old singer, rapper, and producer accused Diddy of drugging and raping her at a house party he hosted in New York in December 2022. The Jane Doe claims she and several friends, also independent musicians, were invited to Diddy’s party, where they recognized various celebrities from the music and TV industries. Doe claims she repeatedly declined offers from waitstaff to consume provided drugs, but she did accept a single glass of wine. The lawsuit claims that Diddy approached Doe to discuss her music career, offered to feature her on a track, and invited her into his office. Once there, Doe alleges, she began to slip in and out of consciousness as Diddy raped and sexually assaulted her. The next thing she claims to remember is waking up around 6 a.m., confused and disoriented. The lawsuit states Doe “discovered blood on her legs from her vaginal area, and bruising on her lips,” as well as “deep imprints on her arms and wrists, suggesting she had been tied with ropes.” Doe alleges her phone and clothes were absent, but she found a different outfit, got dressed, and hurriedly left the residence.John Doe, a personal trainer who worked with celebrities, also filed a lawsuit against Diddy, claiming that he was sexually assaulted on June 27, 2022. When a fashion designer client said Diddy wanted to feature Doe in a video after seeing clips of his workouts, she invited him to attend an awards show afterparty in Los Angeles, hosted by Diddy. The lawsuit claims that a private car picked up Doe and dropped him at Diddy’s Hollywood Hills residence, where Doe was asked to sign an NDA but never given a copy. Doe claims he was handed a beverage and ordered to drink it to enter the party, so he complied. After allegedly being greeted by a current client, Doe claims he was led to a smaller room where he “observed approximately a dozen individuals, including several well-known figures, who were engaging in group-sex activities.” Doe then allegedly began feeling disoriented. The lawsuit claims Diddy removed Doe’s pants and performed nonconsensual oral sex on him, and then ordered Doe to perform oral sex on a different celebrity in the room, who also spit into his mouth. The lawsuit states that Doe went in and out of consciousness while “individuals, including Combs, essentially passed Plaintiff’s drugged body around like a party favor for their sexual enjoyment.” When he regained consciousness, Doe claims he was outside his apartment without his phone or shirt, but didn’t know how he got there.A different John Doe, a Los Angeles businessman who owns a luxury rental business for cars and jewelry, also filed a lawsuit against Diddy for sexual assault that took place at a promotional party launching Diddy’s Ciroc vodka drink in 2022. Doe claims that Diddy personally invited him to the Ciroc party, as he was a frequent client of Doe’s business, and expressed other high-profile guests would attend with whom he could potentially network. During the event, Diddy allegedly instructed Doe to join him in his private office, where Doe claims the intoxicated rapper proceeded to remove his own pants, expose his genitals to Doe, and then grab Doe’s genitals through his pants. The lawsuit claims that the situation “escalated” until a professional athlete entered the office and the alleged assault immediately ended. Doe then left the party to return home.In her lawsuit, the third Jane Doe claims that she attended a Las Vegas party hosted by Diddy over Memorial Day weekend in 2014. While staying at Hotel Rio with two friends, Doe alleges, she asked industry contacts for “cool events” happening, and promoter International Smoove directed her towards Diddy’s exclusive party at poolside lounge Club Rehab, but only if she went alone. Doe attended and was then invited to an afterparty at Diddy’s Planet Hollywood suite, where Diddy suggested she grabs a bottle of Ciroc vodka. After taking a few sips around 8 p.m., Doe claims she felt dizzy and asked to leave, but Smoove guided her to an empty bedroom to lay down and told her the door would be locked. The lawsuit claims Doe blacked out and awoke in the morning to a shirtless Diddy yelling into his phone and the realization that “her entire body hurt” and she was naked. Doe claims she then escaped the bedroom once Diddy left, returned to her friends in their own hotel room, and slept for two days.Diddy’s team has not released a new statement on the federal lawsuits, but the musician’s lawyers did speak out against the previous six lawsuits that were also filed by the Buzbee Law Firm, which represents these new cases, too: “The press conference and 1-800 number that preceded today’s barrage of filings were clear attempts to garner publicity. Mr. Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts, their legal defenses, and the integrity of the judicial process. In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone—adult or minor, man or woman.”Diddy is currently incarcerated on federal charges of racketeering conspiracy; sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty, and he is due to stand trial on May 5, 2025. Diddy is also facing numerous lawsuits for alleged abuse. He has broadly denied allegations of wrongdoing.If you or someone you know has been affected by sexual assault, we encourage you to reach out for support:RAINN National Sexual Assault Hotlinehttps://rainn.org1 800 656 HOPE (4673)Crisis Text LineSMS: Text “HELLO” or “HOLA” to 741-741",
