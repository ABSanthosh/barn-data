  "text": "Napster – the company you're now just remembering still exists in 2025 without the words \"Lars Ulrich\" attached to it – has been purchased by Infinite Reality for a cool $207 million. According to a press release from Infinite Reality, the company plans on turning Napster into \"social music platform that prioritizes active fan engagement over passive listening, allowing artists to connect with, own, and monetize the relationship with their fans.\" This isn't the first time that Napster has been purchased either. After filing for bankruptcy and shutting down in 2002, Napster was eventually bought by Best Buy in 2008 before merging with Rhapsody. Napster was eventually sold to virtual reality concerts company MelodyVR in 2020, and sold to Hivemind and Algorand in 2022. \"By acquiring Napster, we're paving a path to a brighter future for artists, fans, and the music industry at large,\" said John Acunto, Co-Founder and CEO of Infinite Reality. \"This strategic move aligns with Infinite Reality's vision to lead an internet industry shift from a flat 2D clickable web to a 3D conversational one – giving all creators modern tools to better engage, monetize, and measure their audiences. \"I firmly believe that the artist-fan relationship is evolving, with fans craving hyper-personalized, intimate access to their favorite artists, while artists are searching for innovative ways to deepen connections with fans, and access new streams of revenue. We're creating the ultimate music platform where artists can thrive in the next wave of digital disruption.\" Lars Ulrich has not yet issued a statement. Want More Metal?
