  "text": "Ex-vocalist Howard Jones left Killswitch Engage in 2012, after almost a decade with the band. Ever since, he has been working on various small projects, but announced last December that he and Adam Dutkiewicz – well-known producer and current member of Killswitch Engage – for a new project they were working on called Burn Eternal, saying that everything is mixed and mastered. Now, Howard Jones has confirmed that he's working on yet another project – his own. Josh Gilbert, Spiritbox producer and Joseph McQueen, As I Lay Dying and Bullet For My Valentine engineer, are joining him in the studio, after Jones posted a photo of the three of them, with the caption: “I'm back with the dream team of Josh and Joseph, my solo album recording has officially begun. We have talked about this for a couple years, thrilled to finally get started. Lots to share with several projects over the next few months, thank you to everyone who has kept up with this crazy ride. Here we go!” So, Howard Jones has officially announced he has at least two brand new projects under his belt that are currently taking up his time, with more to come from them soon.
