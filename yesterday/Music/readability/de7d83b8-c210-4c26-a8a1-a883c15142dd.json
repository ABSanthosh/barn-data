  "text": "After 11 years away from Three Days Grace, frontman Adam Gontier saw himself re-entering the role as frontman of the Canadian rock band in 2024. In Nik Nocturnal's new interview with Gontier, the co-frontman opens up about working with the band again. The nostalgia factory is pumping out bands like the rent is due – as witnessed with The Tony Tapdance Extravaganza – and even Gontier acknowledges the role the newly commodified emotion plays in the recently completed lineup: \"[there's] more excitement than anything, and definitely some nostalgia.\" But, Gontier isn't alone as the frontman of Three Days Grace this time around. He's rejoined the band alongside their \"new\" vocalist, Matt Walst. Walst, the little brother of Brad Walst, the bassist, joined the band back in 2013. Having grown up with the band, \"it was a natural fit to get him to take [Gontier's] spot there.\" Now? \"Let's do it together,\" Gontier remarks, \"Our voices really blend well.\" Three Days Grace will be opening up for Disturbed this spring.
