  "text": "10,000 years before Paul Atreides, the character portrayed by Timothée Chalamet in Denis Villeneuve’s acclaimed Dune films, there was a mysterious sisterhood. These women are the subject of Dune: Prophecy, a new series arriving on Max on November 17th. Watch the official trailer for the project below, which was first shared during a panel at New York Comic Con. Expanding on the two previously released teasers for the series, the full-length trailer teases the formation of the group that would eventually become known as the Bene Gesserit in the Dune universe. These powerful women control just about everything happening in the expansive world initially envisioned by author Frank Herbert. This particular series is based off of Sisterhood of Dune, which was written by his son, Brian Herbert, and Kevin J. Anderson. The trailer offers insight into the characters portrayed by Emily Watson and Olivia Williams, a pair of sisters working to combat forces that threaten the existence of humankind. The footage offers more of the slick sci-fi visuals that have become visual staples of the Dune universe. Fans of the series have plenty to be excited about — in addition to the rollout of Dune: Prophecy, Denis Villeneuve confirmed earlier this year that plans for a third Dune film are underway. For those who haven’t spent time with the dense book series, revisit our (spoiler-filled) look at the plot details that could be waiting in future installments.",
