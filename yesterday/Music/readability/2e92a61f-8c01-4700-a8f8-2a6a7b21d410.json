  "text": "Fresh off a packed European tour, “NARUTO The Symphonic Experience” is set for a North American run in 2025. The live orchestral experience immerses visitors in a two-hour journey through the beloved anime, which is currently celebrating the 20th anniversary of its original TV adaptation. Beginning February 28th in Evansville, Indiana, “NARUTO The Symphonic Experience” will hit more than 60 cities throughout North America, including Los Angeles, Boston, Dallas, Toronto, Atlanta, Orlando, and Seattle. The trek currently runs through May 18th and will wrap up in Boston. See the full list of cities that will welcome the symphonic tour below. Get NARUTO The Symphonic Experience Tickets Here A Live Nation pre-sale for “NARUTO The Symphonic Experience” will take place tomorrow, December 4th at 10:00 a.m. local time (use code JOY). Tickets will become available to the general public later in the week on Friday, December 6th at 10:00 a.m. local time via Ticketmaster or the tour’s website. Once tickets are on sale, fans can look for deals or get tickets to sold-out shows via StubHub, where orders are 100% guaranteed through StubHub’s FanProtect program. “We invite NARUTO fans to celebrate NARUTO with this unique, live-to-picture experience,” shared producer Julien Vallespi. “We created a two-hour film enhanced with a live, symphonic orchestra because the soundtrack plays such a huge role in the anime’s success and is praised by the legions of fans time and time again. The original score, composed by Toshio Masuda is a perfect blend between pop and rock arrangements as well as traditional Japanese instruments like the Shakuhachi and Shamisen.” The result is a two-hour feature crafted from all 220 episodes of the show. The orchestra will perform the most iconic songs and themes from the series, live-to-picture, as iconic scenes are projected on a full-size, HD cinema screen.
