  "text": "Fans of golf and/or hockey and/or Adam Sandler should mark their calendars for April 27th and 30th, as Universal Pictures has announced plans to re-release the seminal 1996 film Happy Gilmore in theaters. Happy Gilmore was Sandler’s second major starring role following 1995’s Billy Madison (no offense meant to 1994’s Airheads, it’s just that that one was an ensemble piece). The movie featured the SNL alum as a hotheaded aspiring hockey player who discovers a more lucrative use for his killer slapshot — professional golf — just when he’s in desperate need of cash to save his grandmother’s house. Directed by Dennis Dugan, Happy Gilmore also stars Christopher McDonald, Julie Bowen, and the late great Carl Weathers. Ben Stiller makes an uncredited appearance as a nursing home orderly who abuses Happy’s grandma (Frances Bay). Thanks to Universal, tickets are on sale now for the late April screenings on Fandango. While this re-release is happening a year before the movie’s official 30th anniversary, the news comes in the months leading up to the highly anticipated Happy Gilmore 2, set to arrive on Netflix this July. While the first Happy Gilmore featured cameos from golf stars including Lee Trevino and Mark Lye, the sequel promises a huge range of additional pros, including Scottie Schefller, Rory McIllroy, Bryson DeCahmbeau, and John Daly. That’s in addition to a cast list that includes Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio/Bad Bunny, Scott Mescudi, Margaret Qualley, Benny Safdie, Nick Swardson, and the returning Bowen and McDonald. Happy Gilmore will be back in theaters on April 27th and 30th. Check out the original trailer below (as well as the trailer for the sequel, premiering July 25th on Netflix).",
