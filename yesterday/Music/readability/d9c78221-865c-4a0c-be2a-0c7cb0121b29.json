  "text": "Black Sabbath will play their final show this Saturday (July 5th) at Villa Park in Birmingham, England. Ahead of the show, the band members have been immortalized as LEGO figures. Thanks to LEGOLAND Discovery Centre Birmingham, Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward are on display as LEGO figures in celebration of the “Back to the Beginning” concert. Just like they will do on Saturday, the LEGO versions of Sabbath are playing a concert at Villa Park (see below), with the only noticeable inaccuracy being the left-handed Iommi positioned as a right-handed guitar player. Fans who can’t make it to the concert can watch the all-day event via a paid livestream. In addition to the final performances by Sabbath and Osbourne, the bill also features Metallica, Guns N’ Roses, Tool, Slayer, Pantera, Gojira, and many more notable rock and metal acts.",
