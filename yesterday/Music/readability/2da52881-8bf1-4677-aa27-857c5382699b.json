Tetris Kelly: Ariana Grande is saying she’s halting the possibility of touring as ‘Wicked’ mania hits a high pitch with some radio smashes. We have the story. Ariana Grande spoke to Variety about her passion for acting and taking a break from the road. She stated: “I feel so grateful to be acting, and I think my fans know that music and being on stage will always be a part of my life, but I don’t see it coming anytime soon.” She added: “I think acting is feeling like home right now. I am appreciative for [my fans’] understanding. I’m so grateful for the ways in which we’ve grown together over this whole journey with ‘Wicked.’ But music will always be a part of my life.” As award season approaches, her role in the movie musical ‘Wicked’ is getting all the buzz and radio play. Grande’s “Popular” has hit No. 27 on Adult Pop Airplay and No. 29 on Pop Airplay, while her and Cynthia Erivo’s “Defying Gravity” debuts on both rankings at No. 39. Are you sad to see Ari depart from her personal music for a while? Let us know in the comments.",
