  "text": "Chappell Roan has just released her long-teased single “The Giver”; give it a listen below. Long time collaborator Dan Nigro produced and co-wrote the country track with Roan, marking the pop star’s first new release since her 2024 single, “Good Luck, Babe!” Roan has been dropping breadcrumbs about “The Giver” since last fall. It was during her debut performance on Saturday Night Live, though, that she played the country track for the first time. Later, billboards popped up across the country with Chappell dressed in various occupations (like a plumber, lawyer, construction worker, dentist and more) promising to “get the job done.” If you happened to give her HOT TO GO! Hotline a call (620-468-8646, which is still active by the way), you could also hear multiple snippets of the track. “The Giver” is new territory for Roan’s discography, considering it’s a country song through and through. With double entendres galore, “The Giver” is a country-embellished track where Roan lets her lover know that she knows exactly how to satisfy them: “Ain’t no need to hurry, ’cause, baby, I deliver/Ain’t no country boy quitter/I get the job done.” Get Chappell Roan Tickets Here Still, the genre is near and dear to the Midwest Princess. “I grew up listening to [country music] every morning and afternoon on my school bus and had it swirling around me at bon fires, grocery stores and karaoke bars,” Roan said on her social media. But is “The Giver” a taste of more country to come? Roan says: “Hmm right now I’m just making songs that make me feel happy and fun and ‘The Giver’ is my take on cuntry.” “The Giver” is available on five limited-edition 7-inch color variants, each featuring artwork that showcases Roan embodying different service-oriented characters. . Earlier this February, Roan was nominated for six Grammys at the 67th annual ceremony, winning Best New Artist. In her speech, she demanded industry executives to provide livable wages and healthcare to their artists. Others weren’t too happy about her plea; the now former chair The Clive Davis Institute at NYU Jeff Rabhan fought back in a guest column for The Hollywood Reporter, calling Roan “misguided” and “performative.” “For the one-millionth time,” Rabhan said. “If they don’t like the terms, they can stay independent, own their masters and take the financial risk themselves.” In response, Roan invited Rabhan to join her in providing aid to said musicians and donated $25,000 to Backline. Charli XCX, Sabrina Carpenter, Noah Kahan, Live Nation, and more later matched her donation. Chappell Roan’s debut breakthrough, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess was released in 2023. After checking out her new song, revisit Consequence’s 2024 year-end wrap-up where we named “Good Luck, Babe!” the fourth best song of the year. Later this summer, she’ll headline Primavera Sound and play festival slots at Reading \u0026 Leeds Festival, Way Out West, and more. Grab tickets here.",
