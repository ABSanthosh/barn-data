  "text": "Jill Sobule, the folk-pop singer-songwriter known for her songs “I Kissed a Girl” and “Supermodel,” has died at the age of 66. According to her representative, Sobule perished in a house fire at her home in Minneapolis early Thursday morning. In 1995, Sobule made history with “I Kissed a Girl,” the first openly queer-themed song to crack the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100. Her other signature song, “Supermodel,” featured prominently in the cult classic film Clueless. Born on January 16th, 1959 in Denver, Colorado, Sobule’s recording career began in 1990 with her Todd Rundgren-produced debut Things Here Are Different. Her eponymous sophomore album followed five years later in 1995; featuring both “I Kissed a Girl” and “Supermodel” it proved to be her most commercially successful release. However, beginning with her third album, 1997’s Happy Town, Sobule made a deliberate artistic pivot, embracing more adventurous pop production and tackling provocative themes such as anorexia, depression, LGBTQ issues, and the Christian Right. While her music was praised by critics and attracted a devoted cult following, disappointing commercial sales ultimately led to her to be dropped by Atlantic Records. Over the next three decades, Sobule continued to release albums that highlighted her unique blend of sharp wit, social commentary, and poignant storytelling. She also became an early pioneer in music crowdfunding. Most recently, Sobule developed an autobiographical musical, F*ck 7th Grade, which earned a Drama Desk Award nomination. “Jill Sobule was a force of nature and human rights advocate whose music is woven into our culture. I was having so much fun working with her. I lost a client and a friend today. I hope her music, memory, \u0026 legacy continue to live on and inspire others,” her manager, John Porter, said in a statement.",
