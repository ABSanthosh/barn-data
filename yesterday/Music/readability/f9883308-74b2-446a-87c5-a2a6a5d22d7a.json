  "text": "Soulfly and longtime bassist Mike Leon have parted ways after 10 years. Both parties have issued statements and the whole thing seems like it was a pretty friendly split. Soulfly has recruited Max Cavalera's son Igor Amadeus for their May 3 show, though no official replacement has yet been announced. \"After many strong years together, Soulfly is parting ways with bassist Mike Leon,\" wrote Soulfly in a statement. \"The tribe are still performing at the upcoming Mexico City's Nu Metal Revolution on May 3rd with the Sorcerer, Igor Amadeus, of Cavalera band, Go Ahead And Die and Healing Magic filling in. \"We're going in different directions now and we thank Mike for all the time spent with us rocking hard on stage!\" Leon also commented, saying: \"After an incredible 10 year journey with Soulfly/Cavalera, the time has come to move on and pursue new opportunities. I'm deeply grateful for the experiences, the music, and the relationships built along the way—it's been an honor to grow alongside such dedicated fans. \"I've been proud to contribute to the music community through my work as Director of Artist Relations with ENKI Cases, supporting artists with industry leading gear protection, and will continue to do so. \"As I look ahead, I'm excited to focus on exploring and creating new musical opportunities! Thank you to everyone who's been part of the journey so far—here's to the next chapter!\" Want More Metal?
