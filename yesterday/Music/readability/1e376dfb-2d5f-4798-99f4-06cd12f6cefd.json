  "text": "Progressive metalcore heavyweights Erra have unleashed their brand new single \"Gore Of Being\", the first of two new tracks scheduled for release this month. The song sees the band once again teaming up with producer Daniel Braunstein (Spiritbox, Dayseeker), delivering a polished and punishing sound that pushes their signature blend of melody and technicality to new levels. The intense and cinematic music video for \"Gore Of Being\" was directed by Pavel Trebukhin, known for his work with Imminence and LANDMVRKS. Erra won't be slowing down anytime soon, either — the band has confirmed that the second single, \"Echo Sonata\", will premiere online on July 18. Stay tuned. \"'Gore of Being' started as an idea that Clint brought into the studio and marks his first songwriting contribution to the band,\" Erra share. \"Lyrically, 'Gore of Being' turned out to be a musing on mortality. \"Despite not writing the lyrics, Clint later had a conversation with Jesse connecting the serendipity between the lyrics and the working title Clint had for the instrumental, which related to his dad's sudden and tragic passing. The song's context took a new shape from there, becoming a catharsis and being that much more special to the band.\" In the meantime, catch Erra with Architects and Holywatr at one of their many tour dates below.
