KPOP DEMON HUNTERS ©2025 Netflix The KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack surges 8-3 in its second week on the Billboard 200 albums chart (dated July 12), becoming the highest-charting soundtrack of 2025. Previously among soundtracks in 2025, Wicked reached a No. 4 high in January, after debuting and peaking at No. 2 in December 2024. Further, KPop Demon Hunters becomes the highest-charting soundtrack to an animated film since Encanto spent nine weeks at No. 1 in 2022. KPop Demon Hunters premiered on June 20 on Netflix alongside its soundtrack. In the tracking week ending June 29, KPop Demon Hunters jumped 6-2 in its second week on Netflix’s Top 10 Movies in United States chart. Trending on Billboard The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new July 12, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on July 8. In the tracking week ending July 3, the KPop Demon Hunters album earned 62,000 equivalent album units (up 97%), according to Luminate. Of that sum, SEA units comprise 56,000 (up 108%, equaling 77.42 million on-demand official streams of the set’s songs — it jumps 10-2 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 4,500 (up 31%, it’s pushed down 18-22 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 1,500 (up 24%). The set’s haul of 77.42 million streams for its songs is the largest streaming week for a soundtrack in nearly two years — since the Barbie soundtrack claimed 79.32 million on the Aug. 19, 2023-dated chart (its third week on the chart).
