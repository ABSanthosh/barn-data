Mark Ronson is seen at Gucci Ancora during Milan Fashion week on Sept. 22, 2023 in Milan, Italy. Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images for Gucci Mark Ronson is remembering legendary producer Quincy Jones. In an emotional piece shared with The Guardian on Thursday (Dec. 26), Ronson reflected on his personal experiences working with Jones — who passed away in November at the age of 91 — and the profound impact the music icon had on his life and career. “Losing Quincy is like a black hole swallowing part of the musical universe,” Ronson wrote. “But his work will live forever, as will his lessons. Keep striving for that deeper knowledge. Always leave space for something bigger than yourself. Because sometimes, magic happens when we get out of the way.” Explore See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news Ronson opened the tribute by recalling a passage from Jones’ 2001 autobiography, Q, in which the legendary musician describes walking away from a successful career in order to study music theory and composition in Paris. Trending on Billboard “Imagine reaching the pinnacle of success, especially as a young Black musician in segregated 1950s America, and saying thanks, but I’m starting over for the sake of chords and harmony,” Ronson wrote. “I fantasize about having that kind of courage.” “But that’s the peril of holding Quincy as a yardstick,” he continued. “He’s an impossible standard. For producers and arrangers like me, he didn’t just raise the bar; he hid it where no one could reach.” Ronson also reflected on the years he spent with Jones, particularly when he was engaged to the legendary producer’s daughter, Rashida Jones, in the early 2000s. The two producers also collaborated on the song “Keep Reachin’,” featuring Chaka Khan, for the 2018 Netflix documentary Quincy, directed by Rashida Jones. “Over the years, he would send me kind notes — he had a particular fondness for Amy [Winehouse] — and we’d often hang out whenever I played the Montreux jazz festival, his beloved stomping ground,” Ronson wrote. “Seeing him there, stage right, seated in his director’s chair — looking every bit the debonair godfather of music, smiling back at you — elicited a wild mix of emotions.” He added, “The greatest producer and arranger of all time, watching your every move, was utterly terrifying. And yet he only radiated generosity. All he wanted was for you to win, to shine. He had already achieved the unimaginable. Now he existed as something rare and beautiful — a benevolent cheerleader for the wonder of music itself.” Jones passed away on Nov. 3 at his home in Los Angeles. A 28-time Grammy Award winner, Jones was revered for his groundbreaking work as a producer and arranger on iconic albums, including Michael Jackson’s Off the Wall (1979), Thriller (1982) and Bad (1987). Jones was also the guiding force behind the recording of the all-star charity single “We Are the World” in 1985, which rose to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and featured a star-studded lineup of artists, including Jackson, Cyndi Lauper, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Billy Joel, Diana Ross, Bruce Springsteen, Tina Turner and Kenny Rogers.
