  "text": "Trouble – currently classic guitarists Rick Wartell and Bruce Franklin alongside longtime vocalist Kyle Thomas (Alabama Thunderpussy, Exhorder), bassist Rob Hultz, and drummer Garry Naples (Novembers Doom) – is slowly but surely working on the follow-up to their 2013 record The Distortion Field. In an interview with Rebel Radio 92.5 FM, Thomas said Trouble has about eight or ten songs ready to go. \"So, on and off for several years now — I mean, probably better than a decade — there's been pre-production very slowly just kind of creeping down the line here,\" said Thomas. \"So, I don't know — there's about eight to ten songs, maybe, on this thing. And they've been trickling the recorded music versions of them to me so that I can get myself in gear and started.\" On a potential release date for a new Trouble record, Thomas chose not to get anyone's hopes up and simply said they're working on it. \"I couldn't give you a timeline on it. I'm always scared to do that anyway, because it seems like every time you say something's gonna happen at a certain time, it doesn't. I think more importantly, we're busy, we're working on it, and that's something that really hasn't happened for a long time. But, yeah, we're ready to get this thing going and give everybody a quality Trouble record. It's been a long time.\" In the meantime, you can check out some footage of Trouble playing their first show since 2023 (and second this decade overall) below. The show took place on January 25 at the Cobra Lounge in Chicago, IL. The show ran as follows: R.I.P. Come Touch the Sky Assassin Mr. White Memory's Garden At the End of My Daze Pray for the Dead Fear No Evil The Wish Paranoia Conspiracy Psalm 9 The Tempter Supernaut (Black Sabbath cover) Want More Metal?
