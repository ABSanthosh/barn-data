Watch a teaser video for the project below.Drake and PartyNextDoor’s history stretches back to at least 2013 when Drake featured on PartyNextDoor’s “Over Here.” More collaborations, such as “Own It,” “Recognize,” “Preach,” and “Loyal,” ensued.Drake released his latest solo studio album, For All the Dogs, in October 2023. $ome $exy $ongs 4 U will be the Toronto native’s third major collaborative effort, following What a Time to Be Alive (with Future) and Her Loss (with 21 Savage). He is due to tour Australia and New Zealand later this month.PartyNextDoor returned last year with PartyNextDoor 4 (P4). It marked his first album since 2020’s Partymobile. It also served as his first self-titled effort since 2016’s PartyNextDoor 3 (P3).Neither Drake nor PartyNextDoor was at the 2025 Grammy Awards last night, but their presence was felt, in a sense, as Kendrick Lamar’s diss song against the October’s Very Own artists, “Not Like Us,” picked up five awards. Drake is currently suing the label behind the track, Universal Music Group, for defamation.",
