Tetris Kelly: This ain’t Texas, it’s L.A., and we’re taking you to the opening night of Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter Tour at SoFi Stadium in Billboard All Access POV: Beyoncé. Of course, the Queen opened with “Ameriican Requiem” but had us shook when she went into the national anthem. She looked and sounded amazing all night. And it was a family affair: Blue is always a star, but Rumi was introduced to the stage and we are overwhelmed. We even got ‘Renaissance’ moments!! And I will never get over the transition from “Texas Hold ’Em” into “Crazy in Love.” Thank you, Beyoncé.",
