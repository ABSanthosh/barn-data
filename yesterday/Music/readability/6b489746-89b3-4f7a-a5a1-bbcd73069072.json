Jason Hand: I can’t wait for everybody to see it. Honestly, it’s awesome.  Tetris Kelly: And I turned into a voice actor for the day. It’s Motufetu, we found it really quickly.Now I’m gonna start off with something hopefully simple, but challenges you a little bit. Describe ‘Moana 2’ in one sentence. Jason Hand: Maui, Moana and a crew go on an epic new journey together with some new friends. Tetris Kelly: There’s so many new amazing characters. So the first one I want to talk to you guys about is her little sister because Moana is such an iconic character, so to bring a little sister in is a big deal. So how did you approach bringing her character to this?  David G Derrick: Yeah, we really wanted to show a way that Moana could have something for her people to look forward to in the future. And I’d love that we have Simea and she is both an emotional connection for Moana, but a symbol of the future for her people.  Tetris Kelly: And then let’s talk about the music. Obviously, I’m here for Billboard, so talk to me about the sound check. And of course, Lin Manuel was at the helm at the beginning… Keep watching for more!",
