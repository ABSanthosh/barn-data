  "text": "Exodus will celebrate the 40th anniversary of their debut album Bonded by Blood by performing the iconic thrash LP in its entirety at two special California shows. Each concert will feature support from fellow thrash veterans Death Angel. The two shows — April 25th at the UC Theatre in Berkeley, and April 26th at the House of Blues in Anaheim — will also commemorate what would have been the 65th birthday of late original Exodus vocalist Paul Baloff, who sang on Bonded by Blood. The band will perform the album in its entirety plus other favorites at each of the gigs. Get Exodus Tickets Here Tickets for the Berkeley show will be available here starting Friday (January 24th) at 10 a.m. PT, while a Live Nation pre-sale for the Anaheim concert begins Thursday (January 23rd) at 10 a.m. PT using the code OCTAVE via Ticketmaster. “Exodus could not be more excited for this show announcement,” stated guitarist Gary Holt. “The 40th anniversary of our debut only happens once, and to fall on Paul Baloff’s birthday, on a Friday, we KNEW we had to crush the Bay Area. Bonded By Blood. Played in its entirety. Only Baloff era songs. Once in a lifetime moment for us. So killer that we added a second show in Southern California to show our appreciation to both regions. Joining us are some dear friends, especially Death Angel. Don’t miss this. Posers must die!” As previously reported, Exodus recently announced that they were parting ways with singer Steve “Zetro” Souza, and welcoming back vocalist Rob Dukes. The California shows will be among Dukes’ first gigs back with the band. Meanwhile, Death Angel frontman Mark Osegueda will be on board for both shows. While he’s currently fronting Kerry King’s new eponymous band, he’ll turn his attention back to Death Angel for these special performances. “Death Angel are so proud to have been asked to be a part of the Exodus Bonded By Blood 40th Anniversary shows in April,” said Osegueda. “A record that changed and inspired the entire thrash metal scene and community! And us in the biggest way! I expect both shows to be nothing less than an extreme outpouring of violent celebratory energy from all of the bands and fans to honor an album that absolutely defined, and still does, the genre known as thrash Metal! You don’t want to miss these shows! Forever Heavier than time!” While Exodus never quite reached the heights of fellow thrash bands like Metallica (of which former Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett is a member), Slayer, and Megadeth, Bonded By Blood is considered by many to be right up there with the greatest debut thrash albums of all time. In addition to the two California gigs, Exodus are also slated to perform at the Decibel Metal \u0026 Beer Fest in Philadelphia on April 4th, along with Welcome to Rockville and Milwaukee Metalfest, which both take place the weekend of May 15th-18th.",
