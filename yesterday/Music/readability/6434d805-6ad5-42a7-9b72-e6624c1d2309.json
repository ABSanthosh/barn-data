SZA Jacob Webster UPDATE (March 19): A week after SZA’s SOS matched Michael Jackson’s Thriller with 79 nonconsecutive weeks each in the top 10 on the Billboard 200, the Grammy-winning Top Dawg/RCA singer-songwriter has broken that tie. Her SOS now boasts 80 weeks in the Billboard 200’s top 10. As noted in the original story below, no other Black artist has as many, or more, weeks in the top 10 for a single album since the Billboard 200 began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in March 1956.  Explore See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news SZA’s 80th week in the top 10 occurs on the latest chart, dated March 22 (at No. 4 again). Thriller spent 78 of its 79 weeks in the top 10 during its 1983-1984 peak, including 37 of those weeks at No. 1. The record for most weeks in the top 10 reached by any album is the original cast album to My Fair Lady, with 173 weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 from 1956-1960. Trending on Billboard SOS was originally released on Dec. 9, 2022, to immediate commercial success. The set debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and spent 10 of its first 11 weeks at No. 1 and remained a regular fixture inside the top 20. The album received a second wind – including two more weeks at No. 1 – after the release of its SOS: Deluxe LANA edition, which dropped on Dec. 22, 2024 and added 15 new tracks. (All versions of the album are combined for tracking and charting purposes and continue to chart under the title SOS.) “Luther,” SZA’s duet with Kendrick Lamar, now has four weeks at No. 1, breaking Lamar’s personal best. It’s also SZA’s longest-leading Hot 100 No. 1: her previous two – “Kill Bill” and as a featured act on Drake’s “Slime You Out” — each had one week on top in 2023. ORIGINAL STORY (MARCH 12): SZA has hit another chart milestone. The singer/songwriter’s SOS has tied with Michael Jackson’s Thriller, notching 79 total, nonconsecutive weeks each in the top 10 on the Billboard 200. No other Black artist has as many, or more, weeks in the top 10 for an album. “My album tying MJ’s Thriller record … Got me speechless,” a shocked SZA told TMZ Hip-Hop following her appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Tuesday evening. In his own social media post on X, Top Dawg Entertainment president and SZA manager Terrence “Punch” Henderson succinctly described the momentous occasion with one word: “Insane,” followed by two praying hands emoji. SOS reached its 79th week in the top 10 on the latest chart, dated March 15, when it held steady at No. 4. MJ’s Thriller claimed its 79th week in the top 10 when it jumped 115-7 on the Dec. 2, 2022-dated chart following its 40th-anniversary reissue. For those wondering, the record for most weeks in the top 10 reached by any album is the original cast album to My Fair Lady, with 173 weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard 200. SZA’s latest chart achievement comes in the wake of other good news this week: “Luther,” her duet with soon-to-be tourmate Kendrick Lamar, is celebrating its third week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. That feat also finds Lamar tying his prior longest Hot 100 reigns: three nonconsecutive weeks with “Not Like Us” between last May and this February and three weeks in a row last April with “Like That” alongside Future and Metro Boomin. Lamar and SZA’s highly anticipated Grand National Tour kicks off April 19 in Minneapolis. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
