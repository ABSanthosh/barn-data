  "text": "System Of A Down embarked on a South American tour starting late April, and ending just the other day. The footage circulating social media of the shows have people in awe. The video you can see above is from Peru. And the following videos are also from Peru, as well as System Of A Down's final South American show in São Paulo, Brazil earlier this week. There are truly no words for the footage – one comment on socials put it perfectly: 'It’s clear now that all those comments that say “come to Brazil” aren’t bots.' And goodness, those are not bots making their own makeshift pyrotechnics. To see thousands of people lighting flares, spitting fire, creating circle-pits that only European and American crowds could dream of is truly otherworldly. South American crowds get fucking insane which you can see through a collection of some fan captured videos alongside drone footage that lead guitarist Daron Malakian uploaded to Instagram below. System Of A Down's first South American tour in 10 years is now over, and they have a few select dates left on their touring schedule, which you can check out below.
