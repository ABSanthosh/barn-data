As part of that benefit effort, the record label Good Music will release a compilation called Good Music To Lift Los Angeles (on Bandcamp) whose proceeds will benefit the LA Regional Food Bank and California Community Foundation's Wildfire Fund. Good Music To Lift Los Angeles features some names familiar to the metal world like King Gizzard \u0026 The Lizard Wizard, Chelsea Wolfe, Health, The Armed, Militarie Gun, and interestingly Tenacious D contributing a cover of REO Speedwagon's \"Keep On Loving You\". So maybe Tenacious D is back? Or this is just something they had sitting around they're using for a good cause. At the very least they've played the cover live in the past. Good Music To Lift Los Angeles is available here on February 7. For those unaware, it all started when there was an assassination attempt on then-presidential candidate Donald Trump's life during a rally near Butler, PA on July 13, 2024. That same night, Tenacious D was playing a show in Sydney, Australia which was also vocalist and guitarist Kyle Gass' 64th birthday. When asked to make a wish for his birthday, Gass responded: \"Don't miss Trump next time.\" Tenacious D vocalist and guitarist Jack Black quickly issued a statement saying he was blindsided by the comment, and didn't feel right continuing their tour or any creative endeavors. \"I was blindsided by what was said at the show on Sunday. I would never condone hate speech or encourage political violence in any form,\" wrote Black. \"After much reflection, I no longer feel it is appropriate to continue the Tenacious D tour, and all future creative plans are on hold. I am grateful to the fans for their support and understanding.\" Gass responded to the backlash on his Instagram, saying in a statement: \"The line I improvised onstage Sunday night in Sydney was highly inappropriate, dangerous and a terrible mistake. I don't condone violence of any kind, in any form, against anyone. What happened was a tragedy, and I'm incredibly sorry for my severe lack of judgement. I profoundly apologize to those I've let down and truly regret any pain I've caused.\" Black made a few brief comments about Tenacious D's future to Variety's Marc Malkin at the Borderlands premiere in August 2024 about , saying: \"We need to take a break. Everybody needs a break sometime. And we'll be back.\" Black then addressed if he's still friends with Gass, saying: \"Yeah, we're friends. That hasn't changed. These things take time sometimes… And we'll be back when it feels right.\" Want More Metal?
