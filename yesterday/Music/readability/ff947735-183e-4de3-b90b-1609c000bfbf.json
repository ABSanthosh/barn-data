  "text": "Scowl have announced their sophomore full-length album and debut LP on Dead Oceans. The new album, Are We All Angels, arrives on April 4. The Santa Cruz band has also shared “Not Hell, Not Heaven,” with a music video directed by Sean Stout. The visual was filmed at 924 Gilman Street, the iconic Californian venue where three members of Scowl first met years ago. Check it out below.Scowl frontwoman Kat Moss explained that the new song is about “feeling victimized and being a victim, but not wanting to identify with being a victim.” She continued, “It’s trying to find grace in the fact that I have my power. I live in my reality. You have to deal with whatever you’re dealing with, and it ain’t working for me.”Scowl reunited with Grammy-nominated producer Will Yip for Are We All Angels after working together on 2023’s Psychic Dance Routine EP. Based on the first two previews of the new album, “Not Hell, Not Heaven” and last year’s single “Special,” the hardcore band is turning toward a more melodic sound in line with pop punk and alt-rock.Read about Scowl in the essay “Hardcore Expanded Its Boundaries in 2023—and the Scene Embraced It.”All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
