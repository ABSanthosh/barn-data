  "text": "Sabrina Carpenter is back with a new song, “Manchild. The track was made in collaboration with Amy Allen and Jack Antonoff, who also lent their hands to Carpenter’s breakout 2024 LP Short n’ Sweet. Get Sabrina Carpenter Tickets Here “You said your phone was broken, just forgot to charge it/ Whole outfit you’re wearing, God, I hope it’s ironic,” Carrpenter sings to open the country-twinged pop ballad. From there, we get a bit of her trademark biting humor: “Did you just say you’re finished? Didn’t know we started/ It’s all just so familiar, baby, what do you call it?/ Stupid, or is it, slow?/ Maybe it’s, useless? But there’s a cuter word for it, I know.” The single serves as a standalone release for Carpenter, who offered a deluxe version of Short n’ Sweet back in February. “Manchild” is also available as a clear transparent 7-inch vinyl along with a B-side called “inside of your head when you’ve just won an argument with a man.” Carpenter teased the release earlier this week, posting a short video of her hitchhiking in the desert with the caption “this one’s about you!!” As for the song’s subject, Carpenter hasn’t explicitly said who the titular “Manchild” is — but she did end her year-long relationship with Irish actor Barry Keoghan in December, and she had previously written the song “Please Please Please” about him (which was also produced by Antonoff and warned that if Keoghan messed things up, she would probably write another song about him). Carpenter has a busy 2025 ahead of her, with a headlining appearance at Primavera Sound taking place this weekend in Barcelona. After she headlines Lollapalooza in August, she’ll embark on a new run of arena dates this fall; get tickets to see Sabrina Carpenter here. As for her non-music endeavors, Carpenter was also recently rumored to be joining the cast of an upcoming Mamma Mia! sequel.",
