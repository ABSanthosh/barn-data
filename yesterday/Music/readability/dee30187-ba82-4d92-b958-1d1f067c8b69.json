  "text": "It's been almost three years since Halestorm released their 2022 record, Back From The Dead. So, every avid music fan knows – music is on the horizon. And, frontwoman Lzzy Hale confirms that the band was \"getting mixes back,\" when talking on Cutter's Rockcast. Working with Grammy-awarded producer Dave Cobb, known for his work with Greta Van Fleet, Rival Sons, and Slash, Halestorm explained that they felt that \"his ADHD mixed very well with [the band's] ADHD.\" A much less organised, but still very cathartic process, Hale feels as if there are \"a lot of personalities that [she's] always wanted to kind of put on a record, but [she] never really had the freedom or time to…\" Tapping into that idea, Hale describes that there are \"some of the heaviest songs [they've] ever written on there,\" alongside \"some really beautiful mid-tempos.\" Most of all, it feels completely authentic, \"There's nothing on this album that anybody forced [them] to do. There's nothing on this album that isn't part of [their] personalities.\" \"The music was telling [them] what to do and not [them] trying to like shoehorn anything in,\" Hale explains. For \"the first time in 20 years,\" \"it is the most Halestorm record [they've] ever done,\" the Halestorm frontwoman said on the podcast.
