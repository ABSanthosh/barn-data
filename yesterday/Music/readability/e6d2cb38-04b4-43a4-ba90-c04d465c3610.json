  "text": "Malevolence is here to stream their new single \"Trenches\" in all its aggressive, ignorant glory. Which isn't my words – vocalist Alex Taylor described it quite literally as that. The standalone single was produced by Josh Wilbur (Lamb Of God, Korn, Gojira) and comes alongside a music video directed by DON Prod. \"'Trenches' is possibly the most aggressive, ignorant and direct song we have ever written,\" said Taylor. \"Over the last few years, we've been playing more in the commercial metal circuit at festivals and arenas, so we wanted to take this opportunity to remind people that we still haven't lost sight of where we came from. The lyrics are a declaration of not needing validation or approval, and a rejection of those who never supported the journey but only show their face when you achieve some level of success.\" Malevolence is currently out on the road in Europe with While She Sleeps, Thrown, and Resolve. 6/11 FR Paris, Elysee Montmartre7/11 DE Oberhausen, Turbinenhalle8/11 DE Leipzig, Taubchental9/11 DE Berlin, Huxleys11/11 PL Warsaw, Progresja14/11 DE Nürnberg, Löwensaal15/11 CH Zürich, X-TRA16/11 AT Vienna, Gasometer18/11 DE Munich Backstage Werk19/11 DE Munich, Backstage Werk21/11 DE Stuttgart, LKA-Longhorn22/11 DE Frankfurt, Batschkapp23/11 DE Hannover, Capitol24/11 DE Hamburg, Große Freiheit 3626/11 DE Münster, Skaters Palace30/11 BE Antwerp, Trix Want More Metal?
