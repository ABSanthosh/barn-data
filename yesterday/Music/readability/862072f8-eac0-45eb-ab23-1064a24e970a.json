Ariana Grande attends the Golden Globes First-Time Nominee Celebration at The Maybourne Beverly Hills on Dec. 17, 2024 in Beverly Hills, Calif. Kevin Winter/Getty Images Ariana Grande is no stranger to the law of attraction, as she points out in her song “Just Like Magic” and as seen in a 2011 tweet in which she predicted she’d portray Glinda in Wicked one day. Explore See latest videos, charts and news Before Grande was honored at the National Board of Review Annual Awards Gala on Tuesday night (Jan. 7), she spoke to Entertainment Tonight on the carpet, where the reporter pointed out that her pink structured gown and ponytail and bangs combo are reminiscent of something Audrey Hepburn might wear. “I love the 50s, 60s glamour, that’s just kind of my favorite — Marilyn, Audrey, it’s just my favorite,” Grande replied. When she was asked if she’s in the process of “manifesting” a role as the late Breakfast at Tiffany’s icon, the “Yes, And?” singer seemed surprised. Trending on Billboard “That would have to be done so well and so perfectly,” she noted of a potential biopic role, and told the reporter that she’s “very kind” for making the comparison. While rumors about a biopic have been swirling for years, there has yet to be any significant movement in the project. Actress Rooney Mara was most recently lined up to portray Hepburn in a Luca Guadagnino-helmed production, though she shared earlier this year that the director is no longer part of the film. Lily Collins was also reportedly suggested for the role, due to the duo’s uncanny resemblance. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
