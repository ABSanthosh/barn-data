Directed by Emmy-winner Nneka Onuorah, Megan Thee Stallion: In Her Words arrives on Prime Video on October 31. Check out a poster for the movie below.“Follow the Houston native’s journey on the road to stardom as she tenaciously navigates fame, grief, pressure, and success,” reads a description for the film. “The documentary unpacks Megan’s most vulnerable moments in a powerful way that allows fans to meet the real Megan Pete.” The movie also promises behind-the-scenes footage of the Grammy-winning artist both at work and at home.This is Onuorah’s second time working with Amazon MGM Studios, having previously helmed the 2022 reality competition series Lizzo’s Watch Out for the Big Grrrls, which earned her an Emmy trophy. “Her raw and beautiful spirit really shines through in the film,” Onuorah said of Megan Thee Stallion during her time shooting the documentary. “She is a champion for all women who deserve their truth to be heard.”Last month, Megan Thee Stallion hosted and performed at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards. She showcased material from Megan, her new album and third full-length overall, for the medley, including “Boa” and “B.A.S.,” plus a live version of “Mamushi” where she was joined by Yuki Chiba.Revisit “Megan Thee Stallion’s ‘Thot Shit’ Director Breaks Down the Video’s Horror and Humor” on the Pitch.",
