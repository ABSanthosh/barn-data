  "text": "Pretty Lights and a small team of determined creatives have orchestrated an online auction that resonates far beyond the confines of his dreamlike dancefloors.As Western North Carolina grapples with the catastrophic aftermath of Hurricane Helene, the pioneering electronic artist has joined a feverish rally to offer a beacon of hope through a rare collection currently under the digital hammer. It's a luminous lot comprising over 150 coveted items, each crackling with a pulse of his creativity and his band's ineffable connection to fans.\"Our fans are really about lifting each other up and the sense of community that we've built is such a beautiful thing,\" Meghan Zank, Smith's partner, tells EDM.com backstage prior to Pretty Lights' set at Austin City Limits. \"So they all want to help. When we see any major devastation, we think, 'What can we do?'\"Pretty Lights, whose real name is Derek Vincent Smith, echoed that sentiment. He and Zank worked with Erin Fritts, Jennifer Rodriguez and Emily Picart to execute the 72-hour online auction, \"Creatives For WNC Relief,\" which features contributions from all around Pretty Lights' vast community. The band's videographer Corey Ramos, a Charlotte native, has also played a pivotal role.\"We're a few hours away, so it definitely hit home, seeing how many friends live out there. Their city was devastated and they can't go back, and some friends are relocating,\" Ramos laments. \"It was just so unexpected and they're just not prepared for that kind of stuff. They're prepared for blizzards—not flash flooding.\"\"It was tough to see. So after a week of kind of just figuring out how we could help, we figured this might be the best way. A lot of people have love for that area through the music scene.\"Among the treasures up for grabs are over 15 autographed official prints—rare relics no longer available to the public—alongside tickets to upcoming shows and high-quality photo prints captured by Pretty Lights' photographer, Brittany Teuber. Other highlights include lessons from renowned drummer Adam Deitch and Lettuce guitarist Adam \"Shmeeans\" Smirnoff.Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesAn official photo print of Pretty Lights captured by the band's official photographer, Brittany Teuber.Brittany Teuber/Brizzzzzle\"Creatives For WNC Relief\" even includes a guarantee for song or sample requests at Pretty Lights' performances, letting fans take part in curating the very sound that defines their lives. But as bidders vie for these gems, they're also contributing to a larger narrative of resilience and restoration.To that end, the silent auction speaks volumes about the transformative power of art in times of crisis. Zank paints a picture of a deeply passionate grassroots effort to prove that electronic music can help rebuild, both spiritually and materially.\"The music that [Smith] makes really comes from the deepest part of his soul,\" she says. \"It speaks to the human experience and I think it's super relatable. And he's just a really true artist. So I think when something's real, it just attracts power. Taking care of each other—it's not about just him, it's about our team and the community around us.\"\"Connection is a big theme around here,\" Ramos adds. \"I feel like any way that PL gets a chance to connect or fuse the connection themselves, they'll take advantage of it.\"\"Creatives For WNC Relief\" ends October 15th at 7pm EST (5pm MST, 4pm PST).
