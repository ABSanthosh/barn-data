  "text": "Two executives who supported Taylor Swift’s early music have reunited to launch a new record label focused on developing cross-genre artists.Big Machine Label Group on Monday (July 7) launched a new imprint called Ascend Music in partnership with music industry veteran Joel Klaiman, with its first signing expected to be announced later this week.The venture reunites BMLG founder Scott Borchetta with Klaiman, who initially worked together in 2008 to promote Taylor Swift’s hit, Love Story, which went on to become the first song to top both the Country radio and Pop radio charts.Klaiman has previously served as EVP/Promotion \u0026 Artist Development at Universal Music Group-owned Republic Records, where he worked with Borchetta and Big Machine on Swift’s albums Fearless, Speak Now, and Red. He also held roles at Sony Music Entertainment, Columbia Records (as Executive Vice President and General Manager), Republic Records (as EVP, Promotion and Artist Development), and Epic Records (as EVP, Promotion and Artist Development).“[Joel Klaiman is] bringing great artists to the partnership, and we will be wasting no time in getting out some game-changing music.”Scott Borchetta, Big Machine Label GroupIn August 2023, Klaiman launched ASCEND4M, described as a global music and entertainment marketing and consulting agency focused on comprehensive media strategies and practical artist and brand development.Klaiman and Borchetta will now collaborate via Ascend Music in “breaking and amplifying cross-genre talent.”Commenting on the partnership, Borchetta said: “Joel’s energy, vision, and passion are contagious, and he never leaves any stone unturned when he’s working with an artist.”“He’s bringing great artists to the partnership, and we will be wasting no time in getting out some game-changing music.”“This new venture will fuel the growth of our artists and expand Ascend Music’s global repertoire – aligned with both our companies’ shared vision and a strategy that unlocks exciting opportunities for all involved.”Joel Klaiman, ASCEND4MKlaiman added: “After witnessing first-hand Scott’s entrepreneurial vision and his deep commitment to fostering an artist-first, development-driven culture, it’s a dream come true to collaborate with him and the BMLG team again.”“This new venture will fuel the growth of our artists and expand Ascend Music’s global repertoire – aligned with both our companies’ shared vision and a strategy that unlocks exciting opportunities for all involved.”The launch of the new venture comes over a month after Borchetta joined the advisory board of Siebert Financial, parent company of Gebbia Media, after the latter acquired Big Machine Rock, the Nashville-based rock imprint of BMLG, from HYBE America.BMLG was acquired by Scooter Braun’s Ithaca Holdings in 2019.
