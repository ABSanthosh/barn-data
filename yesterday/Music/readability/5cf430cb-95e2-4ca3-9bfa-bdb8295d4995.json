  "text": "News of Sony's acquisition comes three months after Hipgnosis rebranded itself as Recognition Music Group. Courtesy Photo Sony Music Publishing has acquired Hipgnosis Songs Group, multiple sources confirmed to Billboard. Emails obtained by Billboard under the subject line “Update from Sony Music Publishing” said that the company “has entered into an agreement with Recognition Music Group (‘RMG’) to acquire its subsidiary Hipgnosis Songs Group (‘HSG’), effective immediately.” Hipgnosis Songs Group is one of the companies considered to be under the umbrella of Recognition Music, formerly known as Hipgnosis — which also included Hipgnosis Songs Fund and Hipgnosis Song Management — and is the subsidiary that has housed Big Deal Music and its administration business since the company acquired Big Deal in 2020. The HSG catalog includes the 4,400 copyrights originally from Big Deal, including songs recorded by Shawn Mendes, Panic! At the Disco and One Direction. According to HSG’s Instagram page, their repertoire also includes publishing shares of songs like “Taste,” “Espresso” and “Feather” by Sabrina Carpenter; “Ordinary” by Alex Warren; “Lose Control” by Teddy Swims; and many more current hits.  Trending on Billboard “With this agreement, Sony Music Publishing now owns and administers the Hipgnosis Songs Group catalog, serving as the full-service publisher for its clients and roster of songwriters globally,” the email to HSG songwriters, composers and clients reads. The news of this deal arrives just three months after Hipgnosis rebranded under the new name Recognition Music Group, bringing the bundle of related Hipgnosis titles under one name and one roof. As part of that previous news, it was noted that Hipgnosis Songs Group was still under the ownership of Blackstone and that the company said the division was under strategic review. Billboard reported that Recognition was looking to partner with publishers and music companies for the administration of their assets. A source close to the deal says that Sony’s acquisition of HSG is the result of that strategic review, and that this marks the completion of the company’s rebranding as Recognition. Over the years, Hipgnosis has largely driven the movement to treat music as an attractive asset class for Wall Street investors, bidding sky-high prices for catalogs by Red Hot Chili Peppers, Neil Young, Lindsey Buckingham, Blondie, Justin Bieber and Journey, among others. But Hipgnosis Songs Fund, which was publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange since 2018, has had a rocky last few years. By 2023, HSF ultimately left its investors frustrated as its stock price fell and its dividend was cancelled. Eventually, in July 2024, HSF was sold to private equity giant Blackstone for $1.6 billion. A rep for Recognition Music declined to comment. Reps for Sony Music Publishing did not immediately respond to Billboard’s requests for comment at press time.  The email notes that “over the next few months, we will be transitioning the company to SMP’s services and systems. We are working closely with HSG to ensure that all clients will receive the high level of service that you have come to expect.” By acquiring hits owned or administered by HSG, Sony Music Publishing — which often ranks as the largest publisher by market share on the Hot 100 and Pop Radio Airplay charts on Billboard’s Publishers Quarterly — has become an even more dominant player in popular music.  Read an excerpt of the email below:  Dear Hipgnosis Songs Group Songwriters, Composers and Clients: On behalf of Sony Music Publishing (“SMP”), we are pleased to inform you that Sony Music Publishing has entered into an agreement with Recognition Music Group (“RMG”) to acquire its subsidiary Hipgnosis Songs Group (“HSG”), effective immediately.  With this agreement, Sony Music Publishing now owns and administers the Hipgnosis Songs Group catalog, serving as the full-service publisher for its clients and roster of songwriters globally.   With a unique roster of contemporary songwriters and timeless classics, HSG aligns with SMP’s mission to elevate and support the work of the world’s most impactful songwriters, and we are honored to represent you and your songs. Over the next few months, we will be transitioning the company to SMP’s services and systems. We are working closely with HSG to ensure that all clients will receive the high level of service that you have come to expect. No further action is required from you at this time. In the meantime, your current HSG team remains available to address questions or creative inquiries. You can also reach HSG at HSGcreativeteam@hipgnosissongs.com. For the time being, your royalty payments will continue to be processed and distributed through HSG’s system and your current account access remains unchanged. We will reach out to you directly with important transition updates as they come. Thank you. We look forward to working with you in this next chapter.
