  "text": "The new masked band on the block, PRESIDENT, have dropped their second track, only a week ahead of their debut live performance at Download Festival 2025 in the UK. Due to perform on the Sunday (15th of June), \"Fearless\" was surprise dropped yesterday (Friday, 6th of June) alongside another music video. There is no definitive confirmation as to who is apart of PRESIDENT, but fan theories have been making their way around social media, with some fans pretty certain that the masked frontman is Charlie Simpson of FIGHTSTAR. The sound of the vocalist's voice points people in that direction, with the fact that the record label the new music has been released on – King Of Terrors – was only registered two months ago, and Charles Robert Simpson is listed as one of two shareholders, solidifying that as the most-likely theory. Especially since the second shareholder in the company is Anna Louise Simpson. While PRESIDENT's new song, \"Fearless,\" doesn't quite stack up to their debut, \"In The Name of The Father,\" it's still a promising release ahead of their first festival set. The band seems to be sticking to this ominous sound alongside their anonymous appearance. You can check out the music video for \"Fearless\" below, or stream the single here. Want More Metal?
