  "text": "Volumes' Myke Terry posted to Instagram this past week to announce that the band's fifth studio record has officially been completed. The band's last release, Happier?, was back in late 2021, just over four years since the release before that, Different Animals – Volumes' first record with Myke Terry. And just like clockwork, nearly four years after Happier?, the Volumes frontman posted a photo of the band in the studio with the caption, \"LP #5 is complete! There's so much to say about the struggle and what it took from each of us to finish this body of work, but for now I just want to say \"thank you.\" We suffer on.\" Obviously, there's no announcement of a release date yet, but with the knowledge that the album is finished, it's safe to say we can expect new Volumes material within the next year or so. mi_instagram_embed id=DKR91dXxNft] Want More Metal?
