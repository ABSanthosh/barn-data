  "text": "Rage Against the Machine’s “Killing in the Name,” has hit 1 billion streams on Spotify. Written in the wake of the 1992 Los Angeles riots about racist cops who “are boot licking lackeys and thugs of the racist capitalist ruling class” (according to Tom Morello), “Killing in the Name” was first released in November of that year, and has since become a beloved anthem to many around the world… including those who don’t quite align with the song’s values, like Trump supporters, Guy Fieri, Nigel Farage, and others. Writing on Twitter on Saturday, Morello acknowledged the billion-stream milestone and thanked “all those who listened to it,” including “those who love it, those who hate it, and those that have enjoyed it without understanding it.” “Righteous proof that rebel music and irony are alive and well,” he concluded. In 2022, Consequence called “Killing in the Name” the best song by Rage Against the Machine, with Jonah Krueger writing, “‘Killing in the Name’ is not only the platonic ideal of a Rage Against the Machine song, it’s one of the hardest-hitting political anthems ever written. From the earth-shattering opening guitar chords to the catharsis of the final chorus, the track has found a deserving spot in the history of popular music.” In other RATM news, the band recently made their protest performance outside the 2000 Democratic National Convention available on streaming. Morello also has a pair of shows next month in California, followed by an appearance at Boston Calling 2025 in May (get tickets here). “KILLING IN THE NAME” just hit 1 billion streams on Spotify! Thanks to all those who listened to it: those who love it, those who hate it, and those that have enjoyed it without understanding it. Righteous proof that rebel music and irony are alive and well. — Tom Morello (@tmorello) January 11, 2025",
