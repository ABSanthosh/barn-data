  "text": "Grimes has found God. Sort of. In a post on Twitter / X, the noted vaping enthusiast who wrote an entire album based in polytheism said that “connecting” with the elements of Christianity that center on the self as being of heavenliness or hellishness is “the only way I can quit vaping.” Grimes reposted a message from an account that shares “quotes and insights from old books I’m reading on love, truth, and beauty,” this one describing “mere Christianity” as a series of choices that either bring you closer to God and yourself or farther away. This concept, said Grimes, is what finally got her into the religion and helped her put down the vape. “It is so monumentally embarrassing that I am finally getting into Christianity because it’s the only way I can quit vaping,” Grimes wrote. She added that she’s still more down with a “general deist/ feel like god is physics/ math / sees itself thru our eyes kinda vibe,” but said, “there really is something in here that at least speaks to me and what is strange is I never truly needed it until I had to stop myself from doing something destructive. I don’t usually have a drive that overrides my central nervous system that wants to do smthn as destructive as vaping (so so soooo lame).” This is from the person who may have gotten elf-ear surgery and wanted vampire teeth, but you have to appreciate whatever ways someone finds to better themselves. She continued, “This has rly been sending me into a philosophical tailspin tho cuz I have never ever ever had my mind even remotely accessible to religion like I distinctly was extremely doubtful abt it in like grade 1 before I could even be introduced to the concept of doubting it. “But I am realizing art in and of itself is possibly what god is. The story you tell yourself is very powerful.” Of course, Grimes hasn’t gone fully fundamentalist here, either. She’s always been one to amalgamate philosophical and theological concepts to create her own guidance system. In a followup post, she wrote, “Honeslty [sic] I mostly follow the genghis khan model, can’t drop the paganism fully but yeh, praying works its like meditation with a sword over ur head which frankly I require to function.” Maybe she can say a little prayer for baby daddy Musk? It is so monumentally embarrassing that I am finally getting into Christianity because it's the only way I can quit vaping.
