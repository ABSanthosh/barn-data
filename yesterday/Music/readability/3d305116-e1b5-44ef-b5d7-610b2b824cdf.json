Please don’t ever stop. I still love it just as much as I always have,” Strait said in a statement. “Thank you for an amazing year last year and I can’t wait to see you for a few more again this year.” Specifically, the tour will kick off at the Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia on May 10th, followed by stops in Pittsburgh; Buffalo, New York; and Foxborough, Massachusetts; before wrapping with a final performance in Inglewood, California on July 19th. Why StubHub is Your Best Last-Minute Option to Get Tickets While official tickets for these stadium shows went on sale back in February 2025 through George Strait’s website, some dates sold out rapidly due to overwhelming demand.

Anticipated Setlist Fans attending these massive stadium shows can expect career-spanning setlists from both headliners. George Strait — with his catalog of 60 number-one hits (more than any other artist in history) — will likely perform classics like “Amarillo By Morning,” “All My Ex’s Live In Texas,” and “The Chair,” alongside selections from his latest album, Cowboys and Dreamers.

Who Is Opening for George Strait and Chris Stapleton on Their 2025 Tour? The 2025 stadium shows will feature different special guests depending on the location. Rising country star Parker McCollum will join for the first four dates, while Grammy-winning group Little Big Town will take the stage for the tour’s only West Coast appearance at Inglewood’s SoFi Stadium.
