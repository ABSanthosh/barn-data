  "text": "For a movie about one of American culture’s most famous good guys, James Gunn’s new take on Superman contains more talk than you’d expect about what it means to be punk. And that carries through to the movie’s closing credits, which are accompanied by a deep cut from Iggy Pop and the band Teddybears: “Punkrocker.” “Punkrocker” first appeared on Teddybears’ 2000 album Rock ‘n’ Roll Highschool, and has been covered frequently in the years since: The version that plays over the Superman end credits is from Teddybears’ 2006 album Soft Machine, featuring Iggy Pop’s vocals. Get Iggy Pop Tickets Here For a James Gunn superhero movie, Superman is otherwise pretty light when it comes to needle drops: There are only two songs featured in the movie itself, Sophie Madeleine’s “Bring Me Sunshine” and Noah and the Whale’s “5 Years Time.” Additionally, the movie’s closing credits do include a track from Clark Kent’s favorite fictional punk band, The Mighty Crabjoys. The band’s name first appeared in the Gunn-created animated series Creature Commandos, now streaming on HBO Max — Gunn, Eric Nally, and Devin Williams are the credited writers of “The Mighty Crabjoys Theme.” Superman arrives in theaters on Friday, July 11th. Reviews, including Consequence’s own, have been positive. Iggy Pop’s upcoming tour dates include an appearance at Project Pabst 2025 with DEVO and Death Cab for Cutie — enter here for your chance to win weekend passes for the show.",
