  "text": "Mexican-American band Fuerza Regida have partnered with a hotel in Los Angeles to shelter those affected by the disastrous fires ravaging the city. Since the devastating LA wildfires erupted on January 7th, more than 180,000 people have fled their homes; tens of thousands of structures have been damaged, especially in the hard-hit neighborhoods of Pacific Palisades and Altadena. Fuerza Regida announced via social media that they had rented out a hotel with the room to shelter 50 families. As entire communities have been left in ruin, families displaced by the fires are being encouraged to email logistics@streetmobcorp.com for details. Rooms became available on January 11th and will remain open to families for six nights. “To our beloved community affected by the Los Angeles fires: We are here for you in this challenging time,” the San Bernadino-based band shared. “Please know that we stand with you and will continue to support throughout this difficult period.” Here at Consequence, we’ve launched a special “All for LA” edition of our Protect Live Music t-shirts, where 100% of proceeds will go to MusiCares’ Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort.
