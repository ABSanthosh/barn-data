  "text": "Indie music promoter Sid the Cat has announced a benefit concert to support people affected by California’s Eaton fire. The show, called I Love LA, will take place at Glendale Presbyterian Church on Saturday, February 8, and proceeds will go to the Sweet Relief Musicians Fund. See a poster for the concert, designed by Mike Krol, below.The following artists will perform at the I Love LA concert: Andrew Bird, Bright Eyes, Dirty Projectors’ David Longstreth, Delicate Steve, Ethan Tasch, My Morning Jacket’s Jim James, Kelcey Ayer, Kevin Morby, Lucius, Madison Cunningham, the Milk Carton Kids, Molly Burch, Strawberry Guy, Uwade, and Watkins Family Hour.The independent Los Angeles label Hit the North Records has also released a new compilation to support wildfire relief efforts. Proceeds from Love Los Angeles go to the Mutual Aid LA Network (MALAN). The album boasts contributions from the Album Leaf, Shannon Lay, Matt Pond PA, Carriers, and many others. Find the album below.“Los Angeles has given Hit the North Records a lot since the label’s inception here in August 2022,” Hit the North founder Tom Churchill said in a statement. “I am not someone from L.A., nor from the U.S., yet as a city, it has offered me and the label an abundance; access to venues, record stores, local artists, communities, promoters and so much more.”“On December 10, 2024, Hit the North Records released Hit the North Pole: A Festive Charity Compilation for the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund raising just over $1,000 (so far) and frankly, I didn’t intend to help put together another compilation until later this year with the aim of making it an annual event,” Churchill added. “With the ongoing disaster, however, it feels important to do this much sooner, this time in aid of the city that has offered me so much.”",
