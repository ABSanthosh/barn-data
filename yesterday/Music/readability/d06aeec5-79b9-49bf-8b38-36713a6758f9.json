  "text": "Japanese-renowned multi-instrumentalist and vocalist Ryo Kinoshita is the lead of brand new project, Knosis – a thrashing, blast-beat-ing, head-banging metal band. Celebrating the announcement of their debut record, GENKNOSIS, due out August 1st via SharpTone Records, Knosis has released a brand new single, \"SHINMON,\" and an accompanying music video. The ex-Crystal Lake frontman is known for his sheer talent and skill, fully conceptualised by the visionary project that is both explosive and emotional. Alongside Kinoshita's vocals that showcase his expansive capabilities as he coasts through guttural screams and higher melodies, the project is truly one to keep your eye on.
