  "text": "A devout Christian, a progressive southerner, and a fervent disciple of rock and roll, Jimmy Carter assembled one of the strangest voting coalitions in American history and brought a new kind of swagger to the White House. His death at the age of 100 will be mourned by many, and whatever you think of his single-term presidency and Nobel Peace Prize-winning charitable work, his passing is a chance to celebrate one of his most enduring legacies: a lifetime of loving music. Time and again he wove music into his own formidable ambitions, boosting Black jazz artists while courting Black voters and citing rock lyrics as part of his get out the vote efforts. But it wasn’t mere pandering, like modern-day senators competing to see who can make the worst Taylor Swift reference. As the Governor of Georgia in 1974, he just about lost his mind meeting one of his heroes, Bob Dylan. “When I first met Jimmy, the first thing he did was quote my songs back to me,” Dylan would recall. “He put my mind at ease by not talking down to me and showing me he had a sincere appreciation of the songs I had written.” The two remained close friends long after Carter’s political career ended. He also counted Willie Nelson among his nearest companions, palled around with the Allman Brothers, and earned the admiration of the likes of Paul Simon, Johnny Cash, Nile Rodgers, Bono, and more. Carter was not, as he sometimes portrayed himself, a simple peanut farmer, but he moved easily among the great artists of his day — a driven man with a genuine love of rock and roll. Along the way, he pioneered a different kind of political campaign, opened the door for new illicit substances to be imbibed in the White House, and left an indelible mark on the broader pop culture. — Wren Graves “The Hippest Governor’s Mansion Ever” (1971-75) The story goes that when Gregg Allman visited Jimmy Carter’s governor mansion in Georgia before his presidential run, he opened the door to find Carter “barefoot and in jeans.” If that isn’t cool enough for you, it’s worth noting that The Band’s Robbie Robertson also named Carter’s gubernatorial residence, “The hippest governor’s mansion ever.” It feels commonplace now to envision politicians rubbing shoulders with rockstars, but Carter’s insistence on building relationships with the biggest artists of the era — including Bob Dylan, whom he began a close friendship with in the 1970s — was pretty unique at the time. We’ll never know exactly what went down at Carter’s infamous post-concert afterparties, but sometimes it’s good to leave these things up to the imagination. — Paolo Ragusa Campaigning with The Allman Brothers (1975) When Carter was first vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, he was seen as long shot. Several politicians with bigger profiles were also gunning for the White House, but none of them had a friend like Gregg Allman. Throughout his campaign, The Allman Brothers were vocal advocates of Carter, hosting benefit concerts to raise funds for the dark horse in the race. Such shows raised tens of thousands of dollars, which Carter would then double thanks to legislation at the time allowing public donations to be matched by government money. The Allman Brothers were instrumental in Carter’s success – and he knew it, laying it out plain and simple when he thanked them: “The Allman Brothers just about put me in the White House.” – Jonah Krueger Speech at Record Store Owners Convention (1975) Nowadays, it’s not exactly novel for politicians to quote a line from chart-topping songs, but back when then-Governor Carter was campaigning for the White House, it was a risky move. The rock and roll scare hadn’t yet worn off, and aligning with the rockers meant risking being associated with drugs, free love, and the type of rebellion politicians tend to avoid. And yet, during a campaign stop at a convention for record store owners, Carter sang rock’s praises, quoting “Blowin’ in the Wind” and “Yesterday” as he did so, according to Rolling Stone. Such nonchalant boasting of his (at the time) relevant musical knowledge helped him gain footing with younger voters, and it’s what ultimately led to his unofficial nickname as the rock and roll president. – J. Krueger Accepting the Presidential Nomination with a Bob Dylan Quote (1976) At the 1976 Democratic National Convention, following a combative primary that saw Jimmy Carter rise from 2% name recognition to the top of the polls, he gave an acceptance speech that name-checked FDR, JFK, and… Bob Dylan. “I have never had more faith in America than I do today,” said Carter. “We have an America that, in Bob Dylan’s phrase, is busy being born, not busy dying.” The quote referenced Bob Dylan’s 1965 track “It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding),” but it’s also a terrific example of Carter finding inspiration in Dylan’s uniquely American poetry. Carter wanted his supporters to feel proud, energized, motivated, and that the best was yet to come — all while acknowledging the tumultuous history of this country and envisioning a new cultural identity for Americans. It’s safe to say that Dylan — who became a close friend of Carter — approved of his message. — P. Ragusa The White House Vinyl Collection (1977-81) If a vinyl collection on its own isn’t cool enough, how about a secret vinyl collection? John Chuldenko, a writer, director, and producer, learned about records from his uncle Jeff — as Carter’s youngest son, Jeff spun the music himself when he lived at the White House. The story goes that the records from the curated set (which was started just before Carter took office and which left the White House after the election of Ronald Reagan) are still in prime condition. Knowing the former president’s love for music, those boxes are probably packed with some stellar picks. — Mary Siroky Jazz Fest at The White House (1978) \"SALT PEANUTS!\"In 1978, peanut loving president Jimmy Carter joined Dizzy Gillespie's band at a White House concert. Results were mixed. pic.twitter.com/FZTvF2Dezh — BBC Radio 3 (@BBCRadio3) November 2, 2017 Dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the famed Newport Jazz Festival, Carter’s administration hosted a legendary jazz concert at The White House in 1978. With performances from Dizzy Gillespie, Herbie Hancock, Max Roach, and Sonny Rollins (among several other jazz greats), Carter’s White House Lawn Jazz Fest was a love letter to a musical and cultural movement. Accounts show that Carter shook every single musicians hand before the performances began, and introduced the show as “the first White House Jazz Festival — I hope we have more in the future.” Carter wasn’t just paying homage and respects to the jazz artists of the past, but signaling his belief that the US President has a responsibility to honor the culture of music in America across the board. During the festivities, Carter requested that Dizzy Gillespie play “Salt Peanuts,” a nod to his roots as a peanut farmer. Guests in attendance recall the iconic trumpeter and bandleader looking down at Carter and telling him that he couldn’t do the song alone — Carter then joined the band on stage for the song. “Mr. President, I have one question,” Gillespie said afterwards. “Could you take it on the road?” Carter laughed and said, “After tonight I may have to!”– P. Ragusa and M. Siroky Willie Nelson Smoking Weed on the White House Roof (1980) It’s absurdly fun when whispered stories and legends turn out to be real, and you’d be hard pressed to find a better example than that of beloved outlaw country musician Willie Nelson. In his 1988 autobiography, the artist revealed that he smoked a “a big fat Austin torpedo” on the White House roof in 1980 with someone who spent a lot of time there — later said to be President Carter’s son, Chip. In 2020, over thirty years later, the former president finally confirmed it to be true. The image of the two leaned up against the flag on the roof of the White House is pitch-perfect Americana. — M. Siroky HarmoniCarter (2008) Many presidents have been accused of being blowhards, but in the case of Carter’s harmonica skills it could actually be a compliment. In 2008 the former pol joined Willie Nelson onstage at the Chastain Park Amphitheater for a ripping rendition of Hoagy Carmichael’s “Georgia on My Mind.” Fan footage of the event showed Nelson handling the lyrics while Carter stole the spotlight, sliding and twirling along his instrument with flair. Bill Clinton gets lots of credit for his saxophone solos, but Carter’s harmonica would have blown him off the stage. — W. Graves The Other Mr. Carter (2011) Released three decades after he left office, you might not expect President Carter to play a significant role, if any role, in Lil Wayne’s 2011 album, Tha Carter IV. And yet, 13 tracks in, President Carter’s inauguration speech bursts in as a prominent sample. The not-so-subtly named “President Carter” might have been conceived simply because Lil Wayne (born Dwayne Michael Carter Jr.) and Jimmy Carter share a surname, andWayne used his speech to boast about his large fortune rather than criticize or comment on politics (a lá the many songs that use soundbites of President Trump). Though he never publicly commented on the use of his likeness in the track, we have a feeling he wouldn’t be too displeased with the result. – J. Krueger God, Music, Willie, Kris, and “Amazing Grace” (2016) Rarely have all of Jimmy Carter’s passions come together as neatly as they did on a 2016 night at Atlanta, Georgia’s Chastain Park. Alongside Kris Kristofferson and his old friend Willie Nelson, and with his wife Rosalynn at his side, Carter combined his enduring loves for God and music and belted out the Christian standard, “Amazing Grace.” Carter saw himself off promptly but Rosalynn lingered, hugging the musicians and practically dancing off stage. “That’s about as good as it gets,” Nelson said. The former president surely agreed. — W. Graves Jimmy’s 100th Birthday Tribute Concert (2024) Most presidents don’t even reach their 100th birthday, so Jimmy Carter was already a member of an elite club. But to make his centenarian celebration even more rockin’, The Carter Center, along with his grandson Jason Carter, hosted a special tribute concert at Atlanta’s Fox Theater on September 17th, 2024. The show featured a stacked lineup, including appearances from Maren Morris, Eric Church, Grouplove, and even some Georgia natives like The B-52s, Drive-By Truckers, and Killer Mike. The sets may have been short but they packed an emotional punch, as these artists paid tribute to Carter’s home state, his political legacy, and his favorite songs. “Whether it was on his record player, on the campaign trail, or on the White House lawn, music has been – and continues to be – a source of joy, comfort, and inspiration for my grandfather,” said Jason Carter ahead of the show. Even at 100 years old, his enthusiasm for music was simply irresistible. — P. Ragusa",

But to make his centenarian celebration even more rockin’, The Carter Center, along with his grandson Jason Carter, hosted a \u003ca href=\"https://consequence.net/2024/08/jimmy-carter-100th-birthday-concert/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003especial tribute concert\u003c/a\u003e at Atlanta’s Fox Theater on September 17th, 2024. The show featured a stacked lineup, including appearances from Maren Morris, Eric Church, Grouplove, and even some Georgia natives like The B-52s, Drive-By Truckers, and Killer Mike. The sets may have been short but they packed an emotional punch, as these artists paid tribute to Carter’s home state, his political legacy, and his favorite songs. “Whether it was on his record player, on the campaign trail, or on the White House lawn, music has been – and continues to be – a source of joy, comfort, and inspiration for my grandfather,” said Jason Carter ahead of the show. Even at 100 years old, his enthusiasm for music was simply irresistible. — \u003cem\u003eP. Ragusa\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
