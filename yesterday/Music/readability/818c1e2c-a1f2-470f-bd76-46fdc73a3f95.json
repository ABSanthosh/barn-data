  "text": "There are moments in life that feel simultaneously surreal, understandable and poetic all in one. Today is one of those days as we mourn the loss of John Michael \"Ozzy\" Osbourne, one of the most iconic people to ever grace human existence in our lifetime.  Only 17 days ago the world was shook, as the biggest cultural movement in recent music history unfolded across a full day tribute in Birmingham, UK to the four men who created the heavy metal genre, and changed the face of music forever. It was a mostly cloudy and chilly day, as many wondered if the sky would hold its tears better than we did. The streets of Birmingham were buzzing like never before, filled with Black Sabbath and Ozzy history, tributes and exhibits that occasionally felt like a funeral memorial mixed with alt-cultural celebration. The writing was on the wall, and Ozzy’s life couldn’t have come to a close in more poetic fashion. To be in attendance for Ozzy’s career defining moment, crying alongside 45,000 others as he bid us farewell was an honor I will never forget.  \"Life is funny like that\". Much like David Bowie’s passing two days after his final album, or Lemmy's passing two weeks after his final appearance, it was Ozzy's act of kindness to bid us farewell one last time as he performed the highest grossing concert in history, all for charity. The man known as the \"prince of darkness\" showed just how bright his inner light shines by securing over $190 Million for charity, while pouring his heart out in front of adoring fans. The symbiotic relationship between Ozzy and his fans was well known, a man who thanked and loved to the very end. Even closing Black Sabbath's final set by saying \"It’s the last song ever. Your support has enabled us to live an amazing lifestyle, thank you from the bottom of our hearts.\" These are words that will ring in my ears for many years to come, as I think back to being a 9 year old kid absolutely obsessed with his albums and wearing down my Diary of A Madman cassette to ribbons.  Ozzy Osbourne was more than one of the greatest and most recognizable voices in recorded history, he was a true pioneer of rock and heavy metal, a grammy award winning artist that sold over 100 Million records, a frontman of two of the largest groups the world has ever heard, a pop culture icon, philanthropist, a reality TV star, advertising cameo personality, a statement for alt life and outcasts, a family man and best representation of a case of the fuckarounds I could ever think of. Ozzy was the embodiment and definition of a rock star, but arguably the most diverse one we’ve ever known. He showed us the true potential of being yourself, having fun, and how far you can really go in life doing so.  The metal and rock bands that owe their existence to Black Sabbath and Ozzy is immeasurable, and the ripple into mainstream cultures of every kind around the world is truly impalpable. Today is one of those days we'll always remember where we were when he heard the news, it's a day we'll forever reflect on what it means to be metal. As we mourn the loss of this man who gave us everything, we here at Metal Injection salute Ozzy Osbourne and cherish the memory of the man who did what no one else could. He is indeed the first and last of his kind. Good night dark price. The world will never be the same without you.   Want More Metal?
