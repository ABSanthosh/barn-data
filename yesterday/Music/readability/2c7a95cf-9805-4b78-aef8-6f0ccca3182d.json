Courtesy Photo Round Hill Music acquired the publishing catalogs of songwriters Terry Shaddick (Olivia Newton-John’s “Physical”), Linus Eklöw (Icona Pop’s “I Love It”) and Carmine Appice (Rod Stewart’s “Do Ya Think I’m Sexy”) along with publishing assets of the band Dirty Heads (“Vacation”) and a portion of the master rights for Al Stewart (“Year of the Cat”). According to a press release, the acquisitions bring Round Hill’s catalog value under management back to more than $1 billion following the sales of its London Stock Exchange-listed fund to Concord in 2023. The company continues managing five private funds. Rezonate Music Rights, a new investment platform that’s looking to acquire the royalty rights of music producers backed by a $150 million partnership with Bridgepoint Credit, announced its launch. According to a press release, the investment will allow Rezonate to make “high-profile” producer catalog acquisitions; Bridgepoint is also acquiring a minority stake in Rezonate’s management company. Co-founded by music producer Cam Blackwood, Rezonate has already acquired rights from producers including Loma Blackwood, Mark Crew, James Earp and Jussi Karvinen. Trending on Billboard Live Nation acquired Dominican Republic-based live entertainment company SD Concerts, which promotes Latin and international talent in the Dominican Republic, along with Aruba, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama and Puerto Rico. The company also operates a ticketing platform that services all SD events; it will become part of the Ticketmaster ecosystem under the deal. According to Live Nation, fan attendance in the Latin American region was up more than 25% in the first quarter of this year. Global streaming service Audiomack signed a deal with music fraud detection company Beatdapp to help eliminate streaming fraud on its platform. Through the deal, Beatdapp will remove fraudulent streams from sales reports, detect bots and more by analyzing streaming activity on Audiomack. “By partnering with Beatdapp, we have adopted the best-in-class technology from an impartial third party to demonstrate our commitment to both our creator and rights holder partners, and to uphold the integrity of our editorial recommendations and chart activity,” said Audiomack CEO Dave Macli in a statement. Spotify struck a deal with United Airlines to bring more than 450 hours of free Spotify-curated playlists, podcasts and audiobooks to more than 130,000 United seatback screens. In a blog post, the streaming giant said it’s the first time it has offered audiobooks and video podcasts on an airline. Next year, United passengers will be able to use their personal devices to log in to the Spotify app on the airline’s in-flight screens, allowing them to pick up where they left off on their personal Spotify accounts. Music synch platform SourceAudio launched the first comprehensive AI dataset licensing marketplace through which it will offer 14 million fully cleared tracks to AI companies via an opt-in model. The tracks come from major publishers, indie artists and production music libraries, providing AI companies with training datasets while offering compensation to writers and publishers. So far, the company has partnered with several AI companies, including Wondera.ai, generating more than $1.35 million in new annual recurring revenue for artists and publishers who opted in, according to a press release. Revenue from dataset licensing is paid out to rights holders up front or throughout the term of each license agreement. Rightsholders already on SourceAudio can contact their rep at the company to explore dataset licensing for themselves. Those not on SourceAudio can opt in by contacting the company here. Karaoke technology company Singa signed a deal with Warner Music Group to bring original master recordings from the label’s artists to the Singa platform (the agreement includes both Warner Chappell Music and Warner Recorded Music). “This game-changing deal allows karaoke singers at home and Singa-powered venues worldwide to perform songs by iconic Warner Music Group artists, all using the original backing tracks,” said Singa co-founder/CEO Atte Hujanen in a statement. This is Singa’s first deal with a major label, though it has previously secured deals with publishers and indie labels. Sony Music India signed a joint venture with The Hello Group (THG) to form THG India. Through the deal, Sony Music India’s local reach will be paired with THG’s international touring and artist development network to help Indian artists thrive in the country’s growing live music ecosystem and beyond. THG India will offer comprehensive support for talent, including management, global concert booking and publishing, while Sony Music India will provide strategic investment and access to its creative and commercial platforms. AEG Presents acquired Nashville-based special events production company Gary Musick Productions and the affiliated entity Destination Musick City. Gary Musick Productions will keep its name and continue providing corporate and social event services, including audio-visual production, scenic fabrication, custom set design, live streaming and branding integration. Destination Musick City will remain a destination management company offering immersive experiences and full meeting execution services for groups visiting Nashville. With the deal, Gary Musick Productions will expand its design and fabrication services to music festivals and concerts while giving its clients access to AEG’s network of venues. Symphonic Distribution partnered with Hitmakers Entertainment, which boasts Australian pop and R\u0026B artist Tash on its roster. Going forward, the two companies will support emerging and established artists from Australia and Southeast Asia. “This collaboration allows us to further expand Tash’s career as well as our continually growing roster with the help of Symphonic’s creative and strategic vision,” said Hitmakers boss Mark Feist in a statement. New Sweden-based generative AI startup Songfox struck a deal with Musical AI, through which it will use Musical AI’s platform, containing fully cleared music catalogs, to train its models. Musical AI will provide full reports of what data contributed to each generated song, allowing Songfox to pay rightsholders. According to a press release, Songfox allows users to generate and “tweak” full songs, including AI-assisted lyrics and a library of licensed voices.
