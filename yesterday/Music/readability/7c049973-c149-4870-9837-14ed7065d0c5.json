  "text": "Lady Gaga is the Friday headliner at the 2025 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. She performed at the Indio, California, festival for the first time since her 2017 debut at the event, when she famously replaced a then-pregnant Beyoncé as a headliner. Scroll down to check out footage from the performance, and rewind the livestream below to watch it in full.Billed as “The Art of Personal Chaos,” Gaga’s set was broken into four “acts”—“Of Velvet and Vice,” “And She Fell Into a Gothic Dream,” “The Beautiful Nightmare That Knows Her Name,” and “To Wake Her Is To Lose Her”—plus a finale. She first appeared onstage at the top of a massive, multi-story gown, singing an a cappella rendition of Born This Way’s “Bloody Mary” before launching into the Mayhem single “Abracadabra” as dancers emerged from her skirt. Gaga picked up a guitar for “Garden of Eden,” and held a dance battle onstage to a Gesaffelstein remix of “Abracadabra” that was subsequently released on streaming platforms.Later in the evening, Gaga brought Gesaffelstein out to accompany her on “Killah,” then danced with a life-sized skeleton for “Zombieboy,” giving the latter its live debut. The entire production featured numerous homages to past Gaga iconography, including her Alexander McQueen dress from the 2009 MTV VMAs—now done in white—and a recreation of her leg brace armor from the “Paparazzi” music video. Gaga’s setlist drew largely on her new album and her run of releases from The Fame through Born This Way, omitting any selections from Artpop, Joanne, or Chromatica. She closed out the night with Mayhem’s “Vanish Into You,” “Shallow” from A Star Is Born, and “Bad Romance.”It has been a banner year for Lady Gaga, who kicked off 2025 by announcing Mayhem and performing at the Grammy Awards alongside Bruno Mars. The artists also won the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance trophy that night for their hit duet “Die With a Smile.”Gaga followed her Grammy win with a Super Bowl performance, where she sang her Top Gun: Maverick original song “Hold My Hand” in a pre-taped segment. She also hosted and performed on Saturday Night Live, and delighted fans with a tour announcement.Mayhem includes Lady Gaga’s singles “Disease” and “Abracadabra,” both of which arrived with slick, fashion-forward videos.Follow along with all of Pitchfork’s coverage of Coachella 2025.Lady Gaga:Bloody MaryAbracadabraJudasScheißeGarden of EdenPoker FaceAbracadabra (Gesaffelstein Remix)Perfect CelebrityDiseasePaparazziAlejandroThe BeastKillahZombieboyDie With a SmileHow Bad Do U Want MeShadow of a ManBorn This WayShallowVanish Into YouBad Romance",
