  "text": "Longtime Bleeding Through bassist Ryan Wombacher has quit the band. Wombacher originally stepped down from touring with Bleeding Through in 2024 due to a back injury, and has now left the group permanently. Wombacher played for Bleeding Through between 2002 and 2014, and then again from 2017 to present day. \"I'm proud to be a part of this record. I think it's some of the best BT has ever done. Everyone crushed it. I hurt my back pretty bad in 2020 and again in 2023,\" wrote Wombacher. \"I've never been the same. I played my last show in September 2024. I miss it but there a so many other things I want to do in my free time now. \"I have always loved fishing and hunting and backpacking, it hurts like a motherfucker to to pack in to the backcountry no matter how easy the hike is but it's still the one thing worth pushing through the pain for. I started touring when I was 20. Can't believe I did it until I was 42. Wouldn't change a thing. Missed a lot of family/things happening at home through those years. Thank you for listening and coming out to shows and for all the insane experiences. Bleeding Through is still going hard and I'm super proud of those guys. Thanks for the music.\" Want More Metal?
