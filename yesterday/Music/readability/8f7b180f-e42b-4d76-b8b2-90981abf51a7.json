  "text": "In a chat with Rock Of Nations With Dave Kinchen And Shane McEachern, former Queensrÿche vocalist Geoff Tate talked about his upcoming \"Operation: Mindcrime – The Final Chapter\" tour. The trek is set to kick off on March 18, 2025, in Tucson, and will give the fans a last chance to experience the band's iconic Operation: Mindcrime album performed live in its entirety. This farewell to a cherished classic marks a poignant milestone in the 65-year-old singer's career. When asked why this tour will mark the last time he performs Operation: Mindcrime in full, Tate didn't shy away from humor, explaining: \"Well, because it's gonna take me a couple of years [to hit all the cities and countries around the world], when I'm almost 70. [Laughs] That's a good reason, I think.\" Despite preparing for such a monumental tour, Tate hasn't slowed down creatively. Reflecting on his recent work, he shared, \"Yeah, actually, over the last couple of years of preparing for this upcoming tour, we have quite a few songs written for the album. I guess you don't call ‘em albums anymore. I don't know. We're gonna release a song one at a time, but we have a full album's worth of material that we're gonna release over a two-year period. So, that's all ready to go\" Tate's relentless schedule is evident as he wraps up The Big Rock Show tour in Scandinavia this January, giving himself only a brief reprieve before embarking on The Final Chapter. He added, \"It's funny — people ask me, 'Are you still on tour?' Yeah, I'm still on tour from the last tour that I started years ago. It takes me about two, two and a half years to get everywhere. It's kind of a slow process. So I'm just finishing up 'The Big Rock Show' tour, which ends in Scandinavia in January. And then I have a little time off before we start up 'The Final Chapter' shows.\" As for his future musical releases, Tate remains undecided about whether they'll be under his own name or that of Operation: Mindcrime. However, he teased fans with the promise of a significant announcement, saying, \"I haven't decided yet what it's going to be, but we're definitely gonna make a big announcement and have a full photo spread and all that good stuff.\" In a previous interview on Rock of Nations with Dave Kinchen and Shane McEachern, Tate revealed he's working on the third and final chapter of the story of Operation: Mindcrime, and described the material as having \"more of an early Queensrÿche feel, super heavy\" and, in some cases, \"incredibly technical.\" Want More Metal?
