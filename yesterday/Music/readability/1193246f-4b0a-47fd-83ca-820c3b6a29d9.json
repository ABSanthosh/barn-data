Grammy trophies sit in the press room during the 64th Annual GRAMMY Awards at MGM Grand Garden Arena on April 03, 2022 in Las Vegas. David Becker/Getty Images for The Recording Academy As wildfires continue to devastate parts of Los Angeles, Billboard is working to support the community by canceling all of the company’s Grammy-related events. “Our hearts are with the people of Los Angeles as they face the reality of these devastating fires. Many members of our staff and community have been personally affected, and our core focus at this time is allocating the resources we have to support long term recovery for the city we call home,” the company shared in a statement on Tuesday (Jan. 14). As a result, events including Managers to Watch and the annual Power 100 party have been canceled. “We are deeply grateful for the first responders, firefighters, and community organizers who have mobilized to protect and serve the city of Los Angeles,” the statement reads, noting that the company’s fundraising efforts will benefit organizations including California Community Foundation, Pasadena Community Foundation and Baby2Baby. Trending on Billboard Billboard follows in the steps of a number of other companies who are canceling Grammy events to shift focus to supporting those affected by the fires. Earlier in the day, Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group and Sony Music Group had also canceled plans in the week leading up to the awards show. The Recording Academy announced, meanwhile, that it plans to go ahead with the 67th annual Grammy Awards telecast on Feb. 2. The MusiCares Person of the Year gala (which is set to honor the Grateful Dead) is also still set for Jan. 31. The academy has yet to announce a final decision about other Grammy Week events, such as their Special Merit Awards on Feb. 1, which are usually held at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre in L.A.
