  "text": "Twelve Foot Ninja guitarist Steve \"Stevic\" McKay let fans know – in a rather cryptic post to their Instagram grid – that the band's music had \"unexpectedly\" been removed from streaming services. Yesterday evening, McKay posted a statement to the band's page that read: \"Twelve Foot Ninja's music has unexpectedly been removed from streaming services. In my non-defamatory opinion; a very silly sausage maneuver that does little more than annoy fans. I'm working on getting everything back on track asap. Sorry for the inconvenience – not of Twelve Foot Ninja's doing. I will elaborate in due course. – Stevic\" And with McKay saying that he'll elaborate when it's time insinuates that there is more at play than what the public is being told. So, depending on your region, you may have to wait a little while until you can get your Twelve Foot Ninja fix. You can still find their music on YouTube in the meantime. Want More Metal?
