  "text": "Deftones have announced their 10th studio album, Private Music, set to arrive on August 22nd. In advance of its release, the band has unleashed the lead single “My Mind Is a Mountain.” The album is set to drop the same day Deftones kick off their previously announced North American tour. The summer trek launches August 22nd in Vancouver and runs through a September 19th show in Atlanta (get tickets here). Get Deftones Tickets Here “My Mind Is a Mountain” starts off with heavy guitars before singer Chino Moreno’s familiar voice lets the listener know its unmistakably a Deftones song. The album was recorded with producer Nick Raskulinecz in Malibu and Joshua Tree, as well as Nashville, Tennessee. As previously reported, Deftones had been teasing July 10th for some sort of big announcement, and now it’s official. Private Music, which contains 11 tracks, marks the alt-metal veterans’ first LP since 2020’s Ohms. In addition to the headlining dates, Deftones will make festival appearances on September 20th at Louder Than Life in Louisville, Kentucky, and October 3rd at Aftershock in the band’s hometown of Sacramento, California. Pre-order Private Music via this location. Stream “My Mind Is a Mountain” and see the artwork and tracklist below, as well as a new interview with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe about the new album.
