  "text": "Listen via: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Amazon Podcasts | More Platforms Jeff Bridges joins Kyle Meredith to talk about Slow Magic: 1977–1978, a long-lost batch of recordings from his late ’70s jam sessions that’s finally getting its debut on Record Store Day via Light in the Attic. Listen to the episode above or wherever you get your podcasts. Get Jeff Bridges Tickets Here “It was rough, filled with clams,” Bridges laughs of those once-lost tapes. “But they loved it.” What started as casual improv nights among friends turned into full-blown songwriting sessions, with Bridges tapping into a dreamy, doo-wop-adjacent sound that still feels magical nearly 50 years later. Bridges also reflects on working with legends like Burgess Meredith — who contributes a spoken word piece to the album — and how songwriting often intersects with his acting career. He recalls writing music inspired by Crazy Heart, fantasizing about a King Kong sequel, and even jamming with Bob Dylan on the set of Masked and Anonymous. “He knocked on my trailer and said, ‘You wanna pick?’” Bridges grins. “My hands were shaking.” Looking ahead, the Oscar winner teases new projects with Terry Gilliam and the upcoming Tron: Ares, while leaving the door open for future music. “I don’t know what’s next,” he says, guitar next to him. “I just pick it up, see what happens.” Listen to Jeff Bridges talk about Slow Magic: 1977–1978 and more in the new episode above or by watching the video below.
