  "text": "The Black Dahlia Murder parted ways with guitarist Brandon Ellis earlier this year, but made it known they would continue on with all their scheduled shows. The Black Dahlia Murder vocalist Brian Eschbach has now revealed that legendary guitarist Wes Hauch (Alluvial, etc.) will join the band live for the foreseeable future. Eschbach also revealed that he will not front The Black Dahlia Murder for their appearances at Sonic Temple and Welcome to Rockville due to personal circumstances. Filling in for Eschbach for these two shows will be Guy Kozowyk of The Red Chord. No word on if this has anything to do with the show cancellations earlier this year. \"Hey all! With Sonic Temple and Welcome to Rockville coming up right around the corner, we have a little bit of Black Dahlia Murder current info to share with you guys.,\" said Eschbach. \"First, Sonic Temple will be our first performance with someone that many of you already know — an amazing guitar player, the one and only Mr. Wes Hauch. We're stoked to be playing with him, and you can expect to see him with us for the foreseeable future. \"In other news, I, myself, unfortunately — due to personal circumstances — will not be able to perform with the band at these two festivals. And rather than cancel on this opportunity to play with a bunch of great bands, we decided to ask for a little bit of help. So we're happy to announce that long-time colleague and friend Guy Kozowyk of The Red Chord will be filling in on vocals. \"We hope those in attendance enjoy these once-in-a-lifetime, mash-up events. But don't worry — I will be back with the band this summer, there to melt you guys’ faces. And that's about it. So everyone have a wonderful weekend and we'll see you around the bend.\" Want More Metal?
