  "text": "Kid Cudi is expected to testify in Sean “Diddy” Combs’ federal sex trial later this week, according to People. The rapper, born Scott Mescudi, was in a relationship with Combs’ ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura. After learning about their involvement, Combs allegedly assaulted Ventura at one of his so-called “freak-off” parties and threatened to release sexually explicit videos of her in retaliation. Combs also allegedly threatened to blow up Mescudi’s car. Shortly afterward, Mescudi’s car exploded in his driveway, though he was unharmed. On trial for racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and violating federal prostitution laws, Combs faces between 15 years to life in prison. Even with a verdict pending, his team has reportedly already begun pursing a presidential pardon.",
