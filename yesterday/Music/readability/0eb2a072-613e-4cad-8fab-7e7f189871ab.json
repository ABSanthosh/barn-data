He’s even taking it on the road (get tickets here)! In a conversation with Kyle Meredith, Azaria delves into his journey from comedic acting to rock ‘n’ roll, tackling Bruce’s iconic voice, and the emotional thrill of performing Springsteen’s classics on stage. Listen above or wherever you get your podcasts. Get Hank Azaria Tickets Here Known for his wide-ranging roles in The Simpsons, Friends, and Brockmire, Azaria reflects on his journey from a being Bruce fan in 1976 to fronting a band that performs regularly. He explains how his fandom grew through bootleg live recordings and endless spins of Springsteen’s first five albums. “These songs just mean so much to me. I wanted to do them justice,” he shares. For Azaria, singing Springsteen’s songs is not only about nailing the impression; it’s an emotional outlet and a way to channel Springsteen’s expressive storytelling. Azaria’s new setlist covers Springsteen classics from Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. to Wrecking Ball. Between songs, he uses Springsteen’s classic “talks” style, weaving in personal stories that connect him even further to Bruce’s themes of resilience, creativity, and struggle. Each show also serves as a benefit for his charity, bringing an extra layer of purpose to every performance. This unexpected pivot, he says, has opened a new chapter in his career — one that combines his talent for vocal transformation, his lifelong love of music, and his dedication to giving back. “Nothing brings me more joy than working up these songs,” he reflects, “and every show, I’m finding something new in them, just like Bruce does.” Listen to Hank Azaria talk about Hank Azaria and the EZ Street Band, his love of Bruce Springsteen, The Simpsons, and more in the new episode above or by watching the video below.
