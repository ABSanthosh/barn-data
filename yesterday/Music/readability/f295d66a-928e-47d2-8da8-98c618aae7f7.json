  "text": "Buckle up, because there's a new Serpentine Dominion record in the works! For those unaware, Serpentine Dominion was a short-lived project in 2016 featuring Killswitch Engage guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz, Cannibal Corpse vocalist George \"Corpsegrinder\" Fisher and ex-The Black Dahlia Murder drummer Shannon Lucas. The band put out one self-titled record in 2016, never played a show, and that was it. Now in an interview with the Garza Podcast, Dutkiewicz confirmed he's working on another Serpentine Dominion record and will focus on it more once he wraps up his new album with ex-Killswitch Engage vocalist Howard Jones. \"I'm looking to finish up… I've got five songs done I'd like to get another five written for another Serpentine Dominion record with [Corpsegrinder],\" said Dutkiewicz. Dutkiewicz later noted that he's not sure if Lucas will play on the next Serpentine Dominion record: \"I don't know. I don't even know if Shannon plays drums anymore, which is insane. Last time I spoke to him he was just like, yeah 'I'm not not so much into doing it anymore.' It just takes so much effort to [keep up with that].\" As for a timeline, Dutkiewicz again noted that the Jones record is his priority. \"Like I said, I got to get this Howard record out of my life – it sounds so terrible to say, but it's just been fucking working on it for so long. It's like I said earlier too, it's like when you you spend too much time on something you just make it worse, you know? I feel like I'm at that point where I've heard these songs so much I'm just like 'I don't even know if it's better this way or that way,' you know? I'd like to get it buttoned up and then I can put all of my brain power to writing heavy, grindy riffs.\" So yeah – it sounds like maybe we can look forward to a new Serpentine Dominion in 2026?
