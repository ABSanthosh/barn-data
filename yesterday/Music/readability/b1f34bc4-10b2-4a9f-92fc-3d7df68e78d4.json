  "text": "Nine Inch Nails are embarking on their first live outing in three years on the 2025 “Peel It Back World Tour.” Spanning over 40 dates, the tour includes a leg of UK/European concerts, plus a North American run later this summer. Find more details below, including how to get sold-out tickets, and see the full list of tour dates. Get Nine Inch Nails Tickets Here Tickets for newly announced dates in Chicago (8/20), Brooklyn (9/3), and Los Angeles (9/19) go on sale Friday, January 31st at 12:00 p.m. local time via Ticketmaster. Tickets to Nine Inch Nails’ other 2025 tour dates are now on sale. Fans can also look for deals or get tickets to sold-out dates via StubHub, where your purchase is 100% guaranteed through StubHub’s Fan Protect program. StubHub is a secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand. What Is Nine Inch Nails’ Next Tour? The confirmed dates for the “Peel It Back World Tour” are split into a UK/European leg and a run of North American dates. The UK/European leg kicks off June 15th in Dublin, Ireland, and runs through July 12th at the Portuguese NOS Alive festival — one of many festival dates on the overseas run. After a few weeks, NIN will head back out for the North American portion of the trek. Those dates kick off August 6th in Oakland, California, and run through September 20th in Los Angeles. The itinerary hits major markets such as Chicago, Boston, New York City, and Phoenix along the way. NIN mastermind Trent Reznor had previously hinted at plans to reignite the band in 2025. Already, he and longtime collaborator Atticus Ross are attached to score the upcoming film TRON: Ares under the Nine Inch Nails moniker, which will mark the band’s first new music since 2020. When asked in a recent interview with Consequence if additional NIN music could be in the works beyond TRON: Ares, Reznor teased, “Anything’s possible at this point.” Who Is Opening for Nine Inch Nails’ Tour? Support and opening acts have yet to be announced for the tour. What Are Nine Inch Nails’ 2025 Tour Dates? You can see the full itinerary for Nine Inch Nails’ world tour below.
