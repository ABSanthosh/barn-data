  "text": "Neil Young has endorsed Kamala Harris for president. In a new blog post on the Neil Young Archives, the legendary rockstar highlighted the reasons why he “loves” the vice president, writing, “She is an honest, forthright truth teller who is experienced in the White House, free from ambiguity or evasiveness, who goes straight to the point.” Young went on to describe the Democratic candidate as “clear headed, young enough to hold the office for a couple of bright future terms,” and a “good person who is unafraid to take on criminals and uphold the law of the USA.” Concluding, he wrote, “She’s my candidate for the future of this great country. Kamala Harris will take on the billionaire class and make them pay their fair share of taxes. She will not owe them any favors. She is a kind, considerate American. Cast your vote for a beautiful future for your family.” Though Young has never been one to bite his tongue on American politics, his endorsement of Harris is especially unsurprising considering his distaste for her opponent, Donald Trump. Other than having very different politics, the two clashed when Trump used Young’s music at rallies without permission, leading Young to sue the former president. In 2020, the lifelong Canadian’s distaste for Trump even played a role in him finally becoming a dual American Canadian citizen, so he could officially vote against the former president. That year, he wrote a statement calling Trump a “disgrace to my country.” Meanwhile, Young now joins a long list of musicians who have voiced their support for Harris, including R.E.M.’s Michael Stipe, Bruce Springsteen, Billie Eilish, Linda Ronstadt, and many more. Earlier this year, Young even grated Tim Walz permission to use “Rockin’ in the Free World,” the same song he sued Trump for using. In other Young news, he recently reunited with his longtime collaborator, Stephen Stills, for a charity concert in California.",
