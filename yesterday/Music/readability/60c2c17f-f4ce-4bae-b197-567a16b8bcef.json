  "text": "Marc Maron has revealed that he’s ending his long-running, game-changing podcast WTF With Marc Maron. After nearly 16 years spent interviewing musicians, comedians, and other cultural figures, the veteran comedian and actor will release his final episode of the podcast later this fall. Maron broke the news during the post recent WTF episode with John Mulaney, sharing that both he and his producing partner Brendan McDonald are “tired” and “burnt out,” but “utterly satisfied with the work we’ve done.”“Sixteen years we’ve been doing this, and we’ve decided that we had a great run,” Maron said. “Now, basically, it’s time, folks. It’s time. WTF is coming to an end. It’s our decision. We’ll have our final episode sometime in the fall.” Listen to the full episode below.WTF With Marc Maron quickly established itself as an alternative approach to podcasts, especially when it debuted in September 2009. What began as a space for Maron to hash out his annoyances and beefs with fellow comedians soon turned into a go-to resource for in-depth, sprawling, and laid-back conversations with cultural figures. Maron took a nonplussed but friendly approach when speaking with guests, and in the process regularly coaxed never-before-heard stories from celebrities while making them chuckle.During WTF With Marc Maron’s long run, he recorded nearly 1,700 episodes and talked to everyone from President Barack Obama and Carol Burnett to Ariana Grande and Osees’ John Dwyer. Though episodes typically got laughs out of his guests and listeners alike, Maron never shied away from heavy topics or dark corners. In 2010, he navigated a particularly personal and emotional interview with Robin Williams; and following the 2020 death of his girlfriend, director Lynn Shelton, Maron opened up in a heartfelt, sobering episode.While Maron hasn’t shared what his next plan is, he does have a few projects lined up that have been publicly announced. One of those is his starring role in Deliver Me From Nowhere, the upcoming Bruce Springsteen biopic starring Jeremy Allen White as the Boss. Maron will portray Chuck Plotkin, the producer who painstakingly mastered Springsteen’s pivotal 1982 album Nebraska.Revisit Marc Maron’s 5-10-15-20 interview.",
