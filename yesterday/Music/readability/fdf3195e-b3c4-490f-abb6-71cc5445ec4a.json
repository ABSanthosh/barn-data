  "text": "Warner Music has made a strategic minority investment in SkillBox, a live entertainment and ticketing platform based in India.The deal arrives just a couple of weeks after India’s Economic Times reported, citing an interview with WMG CEO Robert Kyncl, that the company is actively seeking M\u0026A opportunities in India.Warner’s recent M\u0026A activity in the market includes a strategic investment in JetSynthesys’ Global Music Junction in April. The news outlet (ET) reported that WMG took a 26% stake in Music Junction as part of the deal.The company also acquired India-based artist management and live events company E-Positive in October 2023, and bought a majority stake in digital media and music company Divo in February last year.“We’re already doing great in India, but it can be a much bigger part of our story,” Kyncl was quoted by ET as saying last month.The global music industry is becoming increasingly focused on India and it’s not hard to see why. According to Datareportal, there were 751.5 million internet users in India at the start of 2024 – nearly double that of the USA, where 97% of the country’s population are active online. India’s total internet user base at the start of the year only accounted for 52.4% of its total population size, which was 1.44 billion in January 2024.According to stats published by Luminate in January, the market saw the biggest YoY increase in total annual on-demand music streams of any nation last year.As MBW reported at the time, if annual streaming volume growth in the US slows in 2024, as many expect it will – but India manages to sustain its 2023 YoY streaming growth margin this year – India could become the world’s largest music streaming territory by volume in 2024.Founded by Anmol Kukreja and Sandip Ranjhan, with Roydon Bangera and Amarjeet Singha joining as part of the founding team, SkillBox began as a ticketing platform and expanded into a full-suite live entertainment company with ticketing, live brand solutions, and live tech services such as Skillbox Pay.According to Warner, with its focus on “curating niche community-led events and experiences”, SkillBox has worked on artist tours such as Jacob Collier, Steve Vai, Ben Howard, Karnivool, The Midnight, DIVINE, Hanumankind and more, as well as creating live events IP like Bloomverse, K-Wave, Lemonade, and LiveBox.The SkillBox platform counts over 1.5 million users.SkillBox has also expanded into artist management through its dedicated management arm, LevelHouse, which manages prominent India-based artists such as Parvaaz, Blackstratblues, Raman Negi, JBABE \u0026 Parekh \u0026 SinghAccording to Warner, by integrating live events and ticketing into its portfolio, Warner Music India “will offer its artists the ability to reach wider audiences, while fans will benefit from streamlined, unforgettable live music experiences”.“Investing in SkillBox, which is a ticketing, live events, and artist management company, blends perfectly with Warner Music India’s aim of being an artist-first, fan-first company.”Jay Mehta, Warner Music India \u0026 SAARCJay Mehta, Managing Director, Warner Music India \u0026 SAARC, commented on the partnership: “Investing in SkillBox, which is a ticketing, live events, and artist management company, blends perfectly with Warner Music India’s aim of being an artist-first, fan-first company.“SkillBox’s innovative approach to live entertainment aligns exactly with our vision of providing comprehensive services to artists.
