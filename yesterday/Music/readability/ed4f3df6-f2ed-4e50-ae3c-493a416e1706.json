Oasis perform at Principality Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, for night 1 of their Oasis Live '25 Tour on Friday, July 4, 2025. Josh Halling A Welsh teenager planned to attack fans at the first show of Oasis’ comeback tour on July 4, but he was caught by British authorities and has since admitted to a criminal charge. The Times reports that a 17-year-old from South Wales — kept anonymous because he’s a minor — was accused by U.K. prosecutors last month of plotting to attack the opening night of the much-awaited Oasis reunion tour in Cardiff. The teenager had also allegedly been planning to target a dance school near his home, inspired by the deadly knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, England, last year. Trending on Billboard According to the Times, the Welsh teenager researched how to obtain large knives and had a note saved to his phone called “places to attack.” He also allegedly sent Snapchat messages praising the Southport killer, Axel Rudakubana, and told his school guidance counselor at a June 21 meeting that he wanted to commit a “Rudakubana-style attack.” The teenager’s guidance counselor and a Snapchat user both reported him to the police, leading to the criminal case. The 17-year-old pled guilty to a single charge of possessing a document useful for terrorism, admitting that he had a copy of an al-Qaeda training manual on his phone. He appeared in Westminster Magistrates’ Court on June 21, and a judge ordered a psychiatric examination of the teen before sentencing. The opening night of Oasis’ 41-date Live ’25 tour, the band’s first tour since 2009, ultimately went forward without issue at Cardiff’s 74,000-capacity Principality Stadium on July 4. The U.K.’s Crown Prosecution Service and reps for Oasis did not return requests for comment on Wednesday (July 16). Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
