My Chemical Romance’s lineup still features members Gerard Way, Ray Toro, Mikey Way, and Frank Iero. “It has been seventeen years since The Black Parade was sent to the MOAT,” the band announced via social media. “In that time, a great Dictator has risen to power, bringing about THE CONCRETE AGE; a glorious time of stability and abundance in the history of DRAAG. His Grand Immortal Dictator wishes to celebrate our rich and storied culture, fine foods, and musical entertainments by welcoming you to these great demonstrations of power and resolve. And lending voice and song for the first time in six thousand two hundred and forty six days, their work privilege ceremoniously reinstated, will be His Grand Immortal Dictator’s National Band…The Black Parade.” All shows on the 2025 “Black Parade” tour will take place at MLB stadiums, with the exception of the evening in the band’s home state of New Jersey, which will take place at MetLife Stadium (home of the New York Giants and New York Jets). Following the tour kickoff in Seattle on July 11th, the band will visit San Francisco and Los Angeles. They’ll then jump over to Arlington, Texas before heading north to New Jersey and Philadelphia.
