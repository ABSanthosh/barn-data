  "text": "Sharon Osbourne has revealed that one of her biggest mistakes in managing her husband Ozzy Osbourne was not allowing the metal icon to audition for a role in the Pirates of Caribbean movie franchise. The revelation came during Sharon’s appearance on Billy Corgan’s new podcast The Magnificent Others. “Do you want to know the biggest mistake I ever made with Ozzy?,” she asked the Smashing Pumpkins frontman, who responded, “You’re gonna admit to a mistake?” Sharon continued, “He got offered to go and read for Pirates of the Caribbean, and I’ve never said this to anyone.” Corgan replied, “And you said no?,” to which Sharon answered, “I said no.” “Wouldn’t he have been perfect?,” mused Sharon. “Johnny [Depp] wanted Keith [Richards] to be a pirate, remember?” Of course, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards ended up getting the role of Captain Edward Teague, the father of Depp’s Captain Jack Sparrow, in both Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End and Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. It is unclear from Sharon’s conversation with Corgan if Ozzy would’ve been up for the same role, or a different character. Another rock legend, Paul McCartney, portrayed Sparrow’s Uncle Jack in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, also a possible role that Ozzy could have played. Several years ago, Ozzy noted that he’d like Johnny Depp to play him in a movie, but more recently he said he’d prefer a “relatively unknown” actor over the Pirates of Caribbean star. Fans can catch Ozzy and his band Black Sabbath perform their final concert ever on July 5th in Birmingham, England. The all-day event will also feature performances from Guns N’ Roses, Metallica, Tool, Pantera, Slayer, Alice in Chains, and more. Watch Sharon’s full appearance on Billy Corgan’s The Magnificent Others podcast below. The conversation about Pirates of the Caribbean begins at the 54:05 mark.",
