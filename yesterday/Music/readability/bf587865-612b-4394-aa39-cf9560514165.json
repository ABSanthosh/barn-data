I mean yeah, it's three tracks, but this thing is absolutely going to steamroll you into next week. Loosely Aware also features bassist James Leech and drummer Dan Foord (SikTh). Because if you need some of that angular heaviness in your life, you clearly call Foord. Loosely Aware was produced by Londres, arranged and edited by Londres and Foord, and recorded by Sara Killion (Metallica). Loosely Aware was also mixed by Adam Nolly Getgood and mastered by Jaime Gomez Arellano of Orgone Studios. Loosely Aware is available here on Bandcamp. Want More Metal?
