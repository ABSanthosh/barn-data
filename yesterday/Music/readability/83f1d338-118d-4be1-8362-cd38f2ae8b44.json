  "text": "Universal Pictures has been working on a biopic about Snoop Dogg for several years now, and today they revealed that Outer Banks actor Jonathan Daviss will star as the Long Beach rapper – much to Snoop Dogg’s delight. The as-yet-untitled movie will be directed by Craig Brewer, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Joe Robert Cole, and features music from the storied rapper’s career. Snoop Dogg, Brian Grazer, and Death Row Pictures president Sara Ramaker serve as producers.Brewer’s previous directorial credits include Dolemite Is My Name, Coming 2 America, and Hustle \u0026 Flow, among other movies. This upcoming biopic is the first film under Death Row Pictures’ overall deal with NBCUniversal Entertainment and Studios, as the label, Death Row Records, expands into a more visual-focused realm. As for Universal Pictures, that company was behind the 2015 N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton, in which Snoop Dogg was portrayed by Lakeith Stanfield.Last year, Snoop Dogg released the long-teased Dr. Dre–produced album Missionary, which included features by Jhené Aiko, Eminem, 50 Cent, Method Man, Jelly Roll, Sting, and more. That LP followed the 2022 full-length BODR, Snoop Dogg’s first solo album on the revived Death Row Records.At the start of 2022, Snoop Dogg performed with Dr. Dre, Kendrick Lamar, Mary J. Blige, and others during the Super Bowl LVI halftime show in Inglewood, California. Revisit Pitchfork’s review of that televised performance celebrating the 50th anniversary of hip-hop.",
