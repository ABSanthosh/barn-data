  "text": "The White House Correspondents’ Association has seemingly capitulated to the Trump Administration and canceled plans to have comedian Amber Ruffin perform at its annual dinner on April 26th. “The WHCA board has unanimously decided we are no longer featuring a comedic performance this year,” WHCA president Eugene Daniels said in a statement on Saturday. “At this consequential moment for journalism, I want to ensure the focus is not on the politics of division but entirely on awarding our colleagues for their outstanding work and providing scholarship and mentorship to the next generation of journalists.” The move followed outcry from White House Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich, after Ruffin referred to the Trump administration as “kind of a bunch of murderers” during a recent podcast appearance. “This year’s @whca dinner will be hosted by a 2nd rate comedian who is previewing the event by calling this administration ‘murderers’ who want to ‘feel like human beings, but they shouldn’t get to feel that way, because you’re not,’” Budowich wrote on social media. “What kind of responsible, sensible journalist would attend something like this? More importantly, what kind of company would sponsor such as hate-filled and violence-inspiring event?” Ruffian, a contributor to Late Night with Seth Meyers, was announced as the headliner of the 2025 Correspondents Dinner in February. At the time, Daniels lauded the selection, saying, “When I began to think about what entertainer would be a perfect fit for the dinner this year, Amber was immediately at the top of my list. She has the ability to walk the line between blistering commentary and humor all while provoking her audience to think about the important issues of the day. I’m thrilled and honored she said yes.” Even after the WHCA’s concession, Donald Trump is not expected to attend the White House Correspondents’ Dinner.",
