  "text": "During SLIPKNOT's most recent performance at Knotfest Australia – in which the world saw SLIPKNOT play \"Gematria (The Killing Name)\" for the first time ever – there were a few other new additions that also caught the attention of some fans. SLIPKNOT's masks are part of the reason the band is so identifiable. So, when slight changes happen, people notice. More specifically, fans noticed that COREY TAYLOR had gotten rid of the glowing red eyes from his previous mask. But, TAYLOR wasn't the only one –  it seems SID WILSON and JIM ROOT also wore slightly altered masks according to photos circulating. This comes after the bassist 'V-Man' debuted a new mask in August of last year. SLIPKNOT have four more tour dates in Australia before they have a short break ahead of their European festival circuit. Check out the dates below to see what EU festivals SLIPKNOT will be performing at this summer. Since SLIPKNOT have only announced one US festival appearance, it might not be too far out of the realm that Inkcarceration isn't the only festival the band may find themselves at stateside. You can also see the video of SLIPKNOT performing \"Gematria (The Killing Name)\" here.
