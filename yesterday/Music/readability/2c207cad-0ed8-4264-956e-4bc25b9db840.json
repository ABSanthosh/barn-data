  "text": "Glorilla was the musical guest on last night’s episode of Saturday Night Live, hosted by Dave Chappelle. It was her first time on the NBC show, where she performed her Grammy-nominated single “Yeah Glo!” and a Glorious medley of “Whatchu Kno About Me” and “Let Her Cook” with a live band. The former included three outfit changes and a unique stage setup that allowed Glorilla to initially rap from behind bars, while the latter had her flanked by backup dancers and smoke. She also played a bachelorette in a sketch about an online dating show. Watch those performances, plus her SNL promo video with Chappelle and cast member Marcello Hernández, below.Glorilla’s debut full-length album, Glorious, finally arrived at the end of last year after a long wait. Boasting singles like “TGIF” and “Hollon,” the studio LP also includes collaborations with Megan Thee Stallion, Sexyy Red, T-Pain, Latto, and others. Meanwhile, “Yeah Glo!”—the breakout track from her Ehhthang Ehhthang mixtape, which also came out in 2024—is nominated for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance at the 2025 Grammy Awards.",
