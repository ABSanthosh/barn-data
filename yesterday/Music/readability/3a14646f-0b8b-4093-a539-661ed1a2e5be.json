  "text": "Guitarist Sonny Mayo has officially parted ways with Santa Barbara-based metal/punk outfit Snot. The announcement came directly from fellow guitarist Mikey Doling, who shared a video earlier today addressing the lineup change. \"There's something I need to tell y'all. Sonny Mayo has decided to quit Snot,\" Doling revealed, explaining the circumstances behind the decision. \"Snot doesn't fit into his life right now, and he just wants to focus on himself and his life. And Snot's just too busy for him to be able to continue.\" Mayo, a longtime contributor to the band’s signature sound, leaves behind a legacy that Doling was quick to acknowledge. \"So I'd like to wish Sonny Mayo the best of luck in his future, and I wanna thank him for all he's contributed to Snot over the years. We love you, brother.\" Though the departure marks the end of an era for Snot, the band isn’t slowing down. Doling also shared news of a familiar face stepping in to fill the void. \"That being said, our very, very good friend from God Forbid, formerly Bad Wolves, Doc Coyle, is going to be filling in on guitar for the upcoming shows. And we're excited to have him on board. And thank you very much, Doc Coyle.\" The announcement comes just weeks after the band revealed plans for an upcoming European tour scheduled for August 2025. The eight-date run will be particularly significant as it marks Snot's first performances across the continent with new vocalist Andy Knapp, who made his live debut with the group back in January.
