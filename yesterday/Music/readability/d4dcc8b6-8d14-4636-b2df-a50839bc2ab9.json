  "text": "Red Jumpsuit Apparatus made headlines just two weeks ago when frontman Ronnie Winter told Trump voters that they \"are not allowed\" to go to Red Jumpsuit Apparatus shows, citing that the shows would contain \"'woke propaganda,'\" the \"actual words of Jesus,\" and be a place of \"acceptance\" for \"all areas of life and races.\" Winter pointed out that Trump voters would most likely not be supportive of that environment. He even offered refunds. Then, the next day, apparently Winter said the reason he told Trump voters \"not to come here is because I'm protecting my real fans from you. I'm protecting my fans who are homosexual, I'm protecting my fans who have alternative views to yours. I'm protecting my fans from your general assholeness and shitty attitudes and negative way of looking at everything.\" Winter did so in a series of videos that were livestreamed (and transcribed via ThePRP), where in the third video he admits the reason he involved Trump's name in the first place was because \"this is what it looks like when somebody is so desperate to reach the lost that they will literally do anything to be heard.\" He's willing to do anything to get people's attention, to help them realize where they've strayed from Jesus' original message of love and acceptance. It's important to note that Ronnie Winter is a very devout Christian, and does not believe in the way his religion is being construed by the current right-wing movement. And since this whole debacle, just yesterday, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus released a brand new single title, \"Slipping Through (No Kings),\" 'No Kings,' being a phrase that has become a slogan against the main currently occupying the White House. However, the song is more of a call to those who have been lost, rather than shaming them, or approaching them with anger. The first verse states simply, \"I want to sit you down for a talk / To see if you remember the scars / When you were hurt and falling apart.\" You can stream the new Red Jumpsuit Apparatus song here, or check it out below.
