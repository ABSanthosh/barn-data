In a statement, Mötley Crüe explained that vocalist Vince Neil is undergoing a \"required medical procedure recently advised by [his] doctors.\" Mötley Crüe notes that all tickets purchased for the original dates will remain valid for the new dates. \"Mötley Crüe's Las Vegas residency at Dolby Live at Park MGM, originally scheduled for March 28th [through] April 19th, 2025, is moving to September 2025 due to a required medical procedure recently advised by vocalist Vince Neil's doctors. Said Neil: \"To all the Crüeheads who were looking forward to see us this spring, I'm truly sorry. My health is my top priority so I can bring you the awesome shows you deserve, and I can't wait to return to the stage. Thank you for all the well wishes that keep reaching me. Your support means more than you know. \"Nikki Sixx, Tommy Lee and John 5 of Mötley Crüe shared in a joint statement: 'Please join us in wishing Vince a speedy recovery. We are looking forward for him to get well again and to take over Vegas together in September. We can't wait to see you all out there, and thank you for your understanding and support in the meantime.' \"Tickets from the original spring residency dates will remain valid and be honored for the new September show dates.
