  "text": "My Chemical Romance kicked off their “Long Live: The Black Parade North American Tour” at T-Mobile Park in Seattle, Washington on Friday (July 11th). The 11-date run, which is completely sold out after moving an impressive 350,000 tickets, features the band performing their beloved 2006 album The Black Parade in full at each stop. Get My Chemical Romance Tickets Here To start the show, MCR took the stage in updated versions of their signature marching band uniforms from The Black Parade era. They played the album front-to-back, reworking several songs with new, expanded arrangements. Among the reimagined tracks was “Mama,” with a newly added “dagger” outro that the band had previewed on social media earlier in the week. Kayleigh Goldsworthy joined the band on violin for both “Cancer” and “Mama,” and several tracks, including “Sleep,” featured extended new intros and outros. Following the full-album performance, the band returned for a B-stage encore filled with fan favorites and deep cuts, including “I’m Not Okay (I Promise),” “Heaven Help Us,” “Bury Me in Black,” and “Helena.” The night also featured a haunting instrumental performance by cellist Clarice Jensen, who opened the encore with an atmospheric piece incorporating snippets of “An Offering.” The night also featured several highly theatrical moments involving frontman Gerard Way and the band, including holding a mock election in which audience members voted whether to “execute” four people by firing squad. At another point, Way was kidnapped by a clown. Fans have already begun to unpack the show’s undertones, with some interpreting the election sequence, for example, as a metaphor for the illusion of democracy. Check out fan-capture footage of the concert, as well as the full setlist, below. Fans can look for tickets to MCR’s sold-out Black Parade concerts here.
