  "text": "Max has officially become the latest streaming service to crack down on password sharing. Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery announced details of the new “Extra Member Add-On” feature on Tuesday, April 22nd. A primary subscriber can share their Max account with one friend or family member from outside their household for an additional $7.99 per month. These “extra members” will receive separate login credentials and can stream from one device at a time. Only one extra member can be added per account. To accompany the crackdown, Max is rolling out a profile transfer feature, allowing extra members to carry over their watch history, recommendations, and settings to a new account. For now, the extra member add-on is only available to direct subscribers — and not those who subscribe via a bundle plan, like the Disney+/Hulu/Max trio offering. With the paid sharing launch, Max follows in the footsteps of Netflix, which recently increased the cost to $8.99 per month for an ad-free extra member. Disney+ introduced a similar crackdown last fall that costs $9.99 per month for those with ad-free plans.",
