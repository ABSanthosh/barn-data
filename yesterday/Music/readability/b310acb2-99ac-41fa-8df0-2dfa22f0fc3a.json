  "text": "American black metal act Abigail Williams – currently mastermind and frontman Ken Sorceron alongside Vance Valenzuela (Vale Of Pnath) on guitars, John Porada (ex-Nachtmystium, ex-Wolvhammer) on bass, and Mike Heller (Fear Factory, Malignancy) on drums – is streaming their first new song in six years \"Nonexistence\". The song is certainly black metal, but offers a lot of atmosphere and an almost David Gilmour-esque guitar solo midway through. \"This record was born in the quiet hours, when everything felt hollow,\" Sorceron reflects. \"A Void Within Existence isn't just a title – it's a feeling I couldn't shake while writing. There's a loneliness threaded through these songs that came from somewhere deeper than I expected. The world outside was falling apart, and in a way, so was the one inside. \"I wanted to push beyond the limits we explored on Walk Beyond the Dark. Sonically, emotionally, spiritually – nothing was off-limits. I produced the album to stay close to that vision, and with Dave Otero on the mix and Mike Heller behind the kit, everything came to life exactly how I heard it in my head – raw, vast, and crushing. This is a record about absence. About peeling away what isn't real – examining the void left behind. If there's anything left after that – maybe it's the truth. Maybe it's just the void. \"Either way, this is the most honest I've ever been. A Void Within Existence is more than an album; it's a crucible – a journey through the fire where only shadow and silence remain.\" Abigail Williams will release their new record A Void Within Existence on July 18. A Void Within Existence was produced by Sorceron, mixed by renowned engineer Dave Otero (Aborted, Akhlys), and given cover art by Eliran Kantor (Testament, Bloodbath). Pre-orders are available here.
