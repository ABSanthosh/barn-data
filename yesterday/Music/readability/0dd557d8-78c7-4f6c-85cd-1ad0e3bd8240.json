  "text": "The British Canadian singer Rochelle Jordan has announced her first album since 2021. The new album, Through the Wall, is out September 26 via Empire. Jordan’s follow-up to Play With the Changes includes the recent single “Crave” and a new song that’s out today, “TTW.” Find the latter track below; scroll down for the new album’s cover artwork.Chicago house music DJ Terry Hunter produced “Crave,” and Byron the Aquarius and KLSH handled production for “TTW.” In a press statement, Jordan said of her new single:This song, “TTW,” is my album title track. It carries so much power to me. It’s magic. It’s hypnosis. It’s a mantra. This track sets my soul free, so I’m happy to share this with the world, and I hope it touches everyone. These lyrics are my self-talk when I’m affirming all the reasons why I stay so resilient. Why I never quit on myself or the things I wanted to attain in my life. The truth of leaning into your purpose usually is a difficult and complicated journey. How long getting to your goal takes sometimes, down to the haters that want to see you fail for whatever reason, down to your self saboteur. All of that WILL make you feel a way but that is a part of the journey to purpose. This song is a mantra for bussing through the dark walls of your own mind. Getting to the other side of all of what could be holding you back. To all my babies that are listening to this one, big up yourself always because faith and hard work toward your vision will eventually place your dreams at your feet. It’s just a fact.… That and, like I said, let them say what they want to, still here and coming with a bang each and every time.Jordan’s Play With the Changes made the longlist for Polaris Music Prize in 2021. The award ultimately went to Cadence Weapon for Parallel World.",
