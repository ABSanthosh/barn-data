  "text": "Bob Dylan, months after posting a video of rapper-turned-rocker MGK on his Instagram, has returned to narrate the trailer for a new album from the artist formerly known as Machine Gun Kelly. “Lost Americana is a personal excavation of the American dream, a journey to find what’s been lost,” Dylan, the winner of the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, says at the outset of the new video. “This album is a love letter to those who seek to rediscover—the dreamers, the drifters, the defiant. It’s a sonic map of forgotten places, a tribute to the spirit of reinvention and a quest to reclaim the authentic essence of American freedom. From the glow of neon diners to the rumble of the motorcycles, this is music that celebrates the beauty found in the in-between spaces where the past is reimagined and the future is forged on your own terms.” Watch the album trailer, directed by Sam Cahill, below.MGK hasn’t officially confirmed that it’s the real Bob Dylan narrating his video, but all signs point to that being the case, as he posted a photo of Dylan on his Instagram story. Pitchfork has reached out to MGK and Dylan’s respective representations for more information on the team-up.MGK’s new album, Lost Americana, is out August 8. The musician’s follow-up to 2022’s Mainstream Sellout will include the recent single “Cliché.”",
