  "text": "ATEEZ achieve its fifth No. 1 on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart (dated June 28) as the act’s latest release, GOLDEN HOUR : Part.3 debuts atop the list. All fif of the group’s leaders have been consecutive, starting with 2023’s THE WORLD EP.2 : OUTLAW. GOLDEN HOUR : Part.3 sold 101,500 copies in the United States in the week ending June 19, according to Luminate. In total, ATEEZ has collected eight top 10s on the Top Album Sales chart. Also in the top 10 of the latest Top Album Sales chart, the latest efforts from Brandon Lake, King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard, Calum Hood and iTZY all debut in the region. Meanwhile, Metallica’s former No. 1 Load returns after an expanded reissue and SZA’s SOS reenters after new CD and vinyl editions for the deluxe LANA edition of the album dropped. Trending on Billboard Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart ranks the top-selling albums of the week based only on traditional album sales. The chart’s history dates back to May 25, 1991, the first week Billboard began tabulating charts with electronically monitored piece count information from SoundScan, now Luminate. Pure album sales were the sole measurement utilized by the Billboard 200 albums chart through the list dated Dec. 6, 2014, after which that chart switched to a methodology that blends album sales with track equivalent album (TEA) units and streaming equivalent album (SEA) units. ENHYPEN’s DESIRE : UNLEASH falls to No. 2 on Top Album Sales (27,000; down 71%) after debuting at No. 1 a week ago. Brandon Lake notches his first top 10 and biggest sales week ever as King of Hearts bows at No. 3 (20,000). Metallica’s Load, first released in 1996, reenters the chart at No. 4 with 12,000 sold (up 6,925%) after its deluxe reissue in multiple formats with bonus material. (All versions of the album, old and new, are combined for tracking and charting purposes.) Load debuted at No. 1 on the June 22, 1996-dated chart and spent four consecutive weeks atop the list that year. King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard notch its highest charting album ever on Top Album Sales, and fifth top 10, as Phantom Island debuts at No. 5 with nearly 11,000 copies sold. The band had previously gone as high as No. 7, twice, with 2019’s Infest the Rats’ Nest and 2024’s Flight B741. SEVENTEEN’s chart-topping SEVENTEEN 5th Album ‘HAPPY BURSTDAY’ is a non-mover at No. 6 (nearly 10,000; down 32%) and Morgan Wallen’s former No. 1 I’m the Problem rises 9-7 (9,000; down 12%). Calum Hood’s debut solo album ORDER chaos ORDER arrives at No. 8 with 8,000 sold in its first week. SZA’s SOS reenters at No. 9 with 7,500 copies sold (up 228%), following the release of the vinyl and CD editions of the SOS Deluxe: LANA version of the album. iTZY rounds out the top 10 of the latest Top Album Sales chart, as the act’s Girls Will Be Girls bows at No. 10 with a little more than 7,000 sold. It’s the seventh top 10, all consecutive, for the group.",
