From exclusive footage of them in rehearsals to an interview about what their favorite part of Coachella has been, keep watching for an exclusive sneak peek! What did you think of XG’s performance? Let us know in the comments! XG: Hi, Billboard!  Tetris Kelly: Who is the most fashion-forward in the group?  Me! Hi Billboard! I think we’re all just so excited to perform today. We’ve been waiting to perform on this amazing stage with beautiful, beautiful, amazing artists. So we’re just so grateful for this opportunity and in hopes that- we hope to kill it! We’re gonna kill it. Yeah for sure. I mean, it’s Coachella. So there’s stuff the seven of us thought up together, and of course there’s a ton that we talked through and came up with alongside our director, Sienna. There’s stuff she brought to the table, too. But I think, like by all of us creating one performance together, we’re able to really feel it and give it our all today, so yeah, I’m really looking forward to it. The song is called “IN THE RAIN,” and it’s this really emotional, R\u0026B-heavy track that’s super important to us. And because it’s coming out right before Coachella, it feels like – how do I put it? – it’s helping us build up the momentum toward Coachella. That kind of energy is in there too. So I’d be really happy if tons of people watched it. I actually feel like a lot of people are watching it already!  What part of the show are you most excited for? I can’t choose! Should we say it all together? It might be a little crazy. Keep watching for more",
