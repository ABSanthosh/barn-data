  "text": "Chicago's dismal sludge and doom metal crew Stomach is here to completely level your world with their new single \"Oscillate\". The track comes from Stomach's new record Low Demon, due out July 18. Stomach drummer and vocalist John Hoffman commented on the track, saying: \"'OSCILLATE' is meant to be a world-ending track, just every ounce of hatred and negativity in one continuous blast of chaos until it breaks down into something more dismal…an ending of sorts, a metaphor for a hateful life: Your brain is chaos, you waste your life fighting and in the end you're just left in a dark place to wither away and suffer alone. Low Demon was recorded by John Hoffman during the winter of 2024 at The Pit II in Geneva, Illinois, and mixed and mastered by Will Killingsworth at Dead Air Studios (The Body, Magrudergrind, Fugitive), with photography by Britt Crowe. Pre-orders are available here and here on Bandcamp. Want More Metal?
