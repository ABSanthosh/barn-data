  "text": "John Mulaney was treated to an early Christmas present Wednesday night (April 23rd) on his Netflix show Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney. The comedian got Canadian punk band METZ to reunite for a one-off performance of their song “A Boat to Drown In” on the live talk show. Mulaney presented the episode as his Christmas special since the program won’t air in December. “Ladies and gentlemen, it’s time for another Christmas miracle, ” said the host as he introduced METZ’s performance. “They’ve reunited for one night only just to play for you. One of my favorite bands ever, ladies and gentlemen, METZ!” Get John Mulaney Tickets Here METZ then launched into “A Boat to Drown In,” which is the final track on the band’s 2020 album, Atlas Vending. Last year, METZ released their most recent album, Up on Gravity Hill in April, but then announced an indefinite hiatus in October to focus on other projects and spend more time with family. Six months later, METZ were back onstage thanks to superfan Mulaney, and they delivered an inspired performance of the punk anthem, complete with fake falling snow to go along with the Christmas spirit. For a recap and behind-the-scenes look at the entire episode, read our entertainment editor Liz Shannon Miller’s first-hand account of her experience sitting in the live audience. While METZ aren’t touring these days, John Mulaney is hitting the road for a recently announced stand-up tour. The outing will kick off June 27th in Newark, New Jersey, and run all the way through December 19th in Washington, D.C.  Pick up tickets here. Watch METZ’s performance of “A Boat to Drown In” on Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney below.",
