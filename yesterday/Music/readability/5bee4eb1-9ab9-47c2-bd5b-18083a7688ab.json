  "text": "Lizzo was last night’s musical guest on Saturday Night Live. The pop singer performed a medley of her new singles “Love in Real Life” and “Still Bad,” breaking out an electric guitar for the former in an apparent nod to the news that she’ll be playing Sister Rosetta Tharpe in an upcoming biopic. She also debuted an unreleased ’80s-inflected power ballad titled “Don’t Make Me Love You,” and appeared in a sketch as a gay couple’s (cast member Bowen Yang and host Jon Hamm) new baby of uncertain origin. Watch Lizzo on SNL below.After a string of highly publicized legal battles throughout 2023 and 2024, Lizzo made her comeback in February with “Love in Real Life,” releasing “Still Bad” the following month. Both songs were accompanied by horror-inspired music videos directed by Colin Tilley. This marks Lizzo’s third time visiting studio 8H; she first played SNL in 2019 and served as both host and musical guest in 2022. She released her last studio album to date, Special, that same year.Saturday Night Live’s 50th season premiered in September. To celebrate the anniversary, NBC aired the star-studded specials SNL50: The Homecoming Concert and SNL50: The Anniversary Special. Since January, both Timothée Chalamet and Lady Gaga have pulled double-duty, while other episodes have featured performances from Tate McRae and Elton John and Brandi Carlile. On May 3, Quinta Brunson is set to host an episode featuring Benson Boone.",
