  "text": "In an appearance on John Cena's series What Drives You, Jelly Roll also showed off his favorite vehicles. Jelly Roll at the \"Sonic the Hedgehog 3\" Los Angeles premiere at TCL Chinese Theatre on December 16, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. Jesse Grant Given his brand of unflinchingly honest, yet still inspirational, music that that has garnered Antioch, Tennessee native Jelly Roll six Billboard Country Airplay No. 1s and the Billboard 200-topping album Beautifully Broken, he gets messages often from fans who have had life-changing moments through his songs. Explore Explore Jelly Roll See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news But in a recent appearance on the second episode of John Cena’s new series What Drives You, Jelly Roll not only showed off a few of his vehicles (including a bright red 1976 Cadillac El Dorado), but also told Cena about one fan note that was so impactful that Jelly Roll still keeps it on the dash of his vehicle, four years after receiving it. As Jelly Roll and Cena walked to another of Jelly Roll’s vehicles, a Ram 1500 Laramie truck, Jelly Roll noted it was the first car that his family bought for him for Father’s Day five years ago. “This was my daily driver, forever. [Jelly Roll’s wife, Bunnie XO] customized every piece on it…jacked it up,” Jelly Roll said. “Dude, she made it my dream truck….it makes me think of my daughter, it makes me think of my wife, it drives me.” Trending on Billboard The truck features Jelly Roll’s logo–a skull wearing a crown–on both the front and the back. “You want to talk about what drives me? There’s a note right here. I want you to check it out if you don’t mind. You can read it right there on my dash.” Cena read the note aloud, saying, “Your music saved my best friend’s life. Thank you for being unapologetically you and doing what you do.” The note was signed simply, “A,” and Cena asked Jelly Roll if he knew who “A” was. The singer-songwriter replied, “You know, the cool thing is, I don’t know. They left this note on my window four years ago, and I sobbed in the parking lot reading this note. I got in and stuck it in my dash. Four years later, that thing is still taped on my dash.” See Jelly Roll’s appearance on John Cena’s What Drives You on Roku.
