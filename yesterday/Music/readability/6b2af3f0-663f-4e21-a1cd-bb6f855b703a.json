  "text": "While you're waiting for that new Megadeth record, why not get yourself some S-tier threads? Megadeth has teamed up with Half-Sumo for a whole new line of fightware merchandise that frankly looks cool as hell. All the merch celebrates Megadeth's Killing Is My Business… and Business Is Good! turning 40 years old, and ties in perfectly with the fact that Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine is a lifelong martial artist that holds black belts in Taekwondo and Ukidokan Karate, as well as a brown belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. \"To see the raw energy of our first album translated into gear that's built for the mat is a thrilling moment,\" said Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine. \"Half Sumo honored the spirit of Killing Is My Business… perfectly.\" \"Megadeth's debut was a declaration of war on the status quo,\" said Half-Sumo founders Luigi Scarcella Perino and Alberto Marchetti. \"It was technically brilliant, unapologetically aggressive, and it set a new standard for heavy music. That is the same energy we inject into our gear—the spirit of the underdog fighting a bigger battle. This collection is for them.\" The Megadeth x Half Sumo Killing Is My Business… and Business Is Good! 40th Anniversary capsule will be released in four highly limited waves, all available right here.
