  "text": "Zulu frontman Anaiah Rasheed Muhammad came under fire over the weekend as extensive allegations of abuse arrived online. Muhammad has since denied the allegations, though Zulu played without Muhammad on March 8 at the NDP Fest in São Paulo, Brazil while former Zulu drummer Dan Brown spoke out against the vocalist online. Now things have gotten worse as promoters New Direction Productions has cancelled the remainder of Zulu's Latin American tour in light of the allegations. Zulu has still not commented on the issue, though I'd imagine they'll have to soon considering the gravity of the situation. New Direction Productions wrote: \"Due to recent event, we are canceling the remaining dates of the Zulu Latin American tour, affecting the following cities: *Medelin, Colombia*San Jose, Costa Rica*Mexico City, Mexico*Monterrey, Mexico \"At the time of the Sao Paolo show, we were in the middle of organizing a festival managing long days, constant travel and early flights to ensure the event ran smoothly. During the chaos of production, we lacked full clarity on the situation as it unfolded. \"The bad decided to move forward without their vocalist, and out of respect for attendees already present, we supported their chance to perform in this altered format. However, growing concerns from promoters, bands and audiences across multiple regions have made it clear that continuing the tour is no longer viable. \"Hardcore is built on integrity, respect and collective accountability. We strongly oppose all forms of physical and psychological violence, particularly against those in vulnerable situations. Our goal is not to pass judgment but to uphold the safety and well-being of the spaces we help cultivate. \"This tour was made possible by the tireless efforts of dedicated promoters and organizations, and we stand in full support of: Noiseground (Buenos Aires, Argentina)Hatred Corp (Santiago, Chile)DTG Group (Medellín, Colombia)Deathbeat Productions \u0026 Deadly Rhythm (San José, Costa Rica)Destiny (Mexico City \u0026 San José)I Wish Productions (Monterrey, Mexico) \"We acknowledge their commitment to building a scene rooted in trust, respect, and safety. This decision, while difficult, is necessary. \"Hardcore has always been a space for self-reflection, discussion, and growth. As organizers, promoters, and community members, our responsibility is to create an environment where everyone feels safe and heard. This is not about assigning guilt or innocence, it is about prioritizing the well-being of our scene. \"We appreciate the solidarity, understanding, and voices of those working to strengthen this community.
