  "text": "It’s the end of an era for an Albuquerque, New Mexico family and a big moment for Breaking Bad fans, as the owners of “Walter White’s house” are now selling their home, which appeared in all five seasons of the acclaimed AMC drama. All it’ll cost you is $4 million. Local station KOB4 spoke with the family about their decision to sell, which follows years of fans coming by to see the house exterior for themselves. “We average 300 cars a day. Come Balloon Fiesta, hundreds of thousands come for balloons. Balloons go up, they come down. Where do they come? Here,” current owner Joanne Quintana said. While Quintana references happy memories from the filming of the show, including the day star Bryan Cranston successfully threw a pizza on the roof in one take, she also expressed her frustrations with the heavy traffic the house has received in the years since the show’s conclusion. This includes fans recreating that pizza moment themselves. Many contentious interactions between the residents and tourists have been posted to social media in recent years. The family has since added a fence to protect the property, but now they’ve decided it’s time to move on. “This was our family home from 1973, almost 52 years. So we’re going to walk away with just our memories. It’s time to move on. We’re done. There’s no reason to fight anymore,” Quintana said. Because of the house’s cultural significance and the $4 million price tag (for a house Zillow otherwise estimates would go for under $350,000), it’s unlikely the house will remain a family home. Said Quintana, “I hope they make it what the fans want. They want a BnB, they want a museum, they want access to it. Go for it.” Breaking Bad is currently streaming on Netflix. Here’s a look back at the characters who crossed over between that show as well as its prequel, Better Call Saul.",
