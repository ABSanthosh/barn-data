  "text": "Long live The Black Parade: My Chemical Romance have officially announced a 10-date 2025 tour celebrating their beloved 2006 album, which they’ll be in in full at every stop. The tour kicks off in July in Seattle and runs through summer, with the finale scheduled for September 13th in Tampa. The band previously delivered a live performance of the full album at this year’s When We Were Young festival. Scroll below for details on how to secure tickets to one of the most anticipated concert tours of 2025. What Is My Chemical Romance’s 2025 Tour? The 2025 tour is a celebration of The Black Parade, which became a sensation upon release over 20 years ago. My Chemical Romance’s lineup still features members Gerard Way, Ray Toro, Mikey Way, and Frank Iero. “It has been seventeen years since The Black Parade was sent to the MOAT,” the band announced via social media. “In that time, a great Dictator has risen to power, bringing about THE CONCRETE AGE; a glorious time of stability and abundance in the history of DRAAG. His Grand Immortal Dictator wishes to celebrate our rich and storied culture, fine foods, and musical entertainments by welcoming you to these great demonstrations of power and resolve. And lending voice and song for the first time in six thousand two hundred and forty six days, their work privilege ceremoniously reinstated, will be His Grand Immortal Dictator’s National Band…The Black Parade.” All shows on the 2025 “Black Parade” tour will take place at MLB stadiums, with the exception of the evening in the band’s home state of New Jersey, which will take place at MetLife Stadium (home of the New York Giants and New York Jets). Following the tour kickoff in Seattle on July 11th, the band will visit San Francisco and Los Angeles. They’ll then jump over to Arlington, Texas before heading north to New Jersey and Philadelphia. After a quick dip into Canda for a show in Toronto, MCR will hit Chicago and Boston. The tour wraps in September 13th in Tampa. Who Is Opening for My Chemical Romance’s “Black Parade” Stadium Tour? Each stop on the 2025 tour will feature a different supporting act. The stacked list boasts the following names: Violent Femmes, 100 gecs, Wallows, Garabage, Death Cab for Cutie, Thursday, Alice Cooper, Pixies, DEVO, IDLES, and Evanescence. Check out the full list of tour dates below to see which cities will welcome each act. How Can I Get Tickets to My Chemical Romance’s 2025 Tour?
