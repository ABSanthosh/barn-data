  "text": "In the wake of Ozzy Osbourne's passing on Tuesday, July 22, tributes have poured in from across the music world — and the Ohioan death metal bruisers in Sanguisugabogg are among those honoring the Prince of Darkness in their own crushing way. During a recent live set, the band dusted off their rarely performed cover of Black Sabbath's classic track \"Sweet Leaf,\" a deep nod to the genre's roots and to the man who helped birth heavy metal. It's brutal as hell and frankly, I think we need a studio version of this. Or a bunch of death metal bands doing Black Sabbath classics. I guess what I'm saying is that we need a Graveyard Classics from a buncha bands – and yes, someone better invite Six Feet Under. Sanguisugabogg's tribute arrives ahead of their upcoming third studio album, Hideous Aftermath, which is set to drop October 10t via Century Media. With that release on the horizon, the band is poised to push their grotesque, groove-laden sound even further. Hideous Aftermath has a boatload of insane guests, which are: \"Rotted Entanglement\" \"Felony Abuse Of A Corpse\" (feat. PeelingFlesh) \"Ritual Autophagia\" (feat. Todd Jones of Nails) \"Heinous Testimony\" \"Abhorrent Contraception\" (feat Josh Welshman of Defeated Sanity) \"Repulsive Demise\" \"Erotic Beheading\" \"Sanctified Defilement\" \"Semi Automatic Facial Reconstruction\" (feat. Travis Ryan of Cattle Decapitation) \"Paid In Flesh\" (feat. Dylan Walker of Full Of Hell) For the recording of Hideous Aftermath, Sanguisugabogg enlisted legendary producer Kurt Ballou — known for his work with extreme metal heavyweights like Nails and High on Fire. \"We got off the road after a LOT of touring and wanted to drill down and be as purely creative as possible without distraction,\" said Swank of the decision to work with the Converge guitarist and production mastermind. \"Kurt mixed Homicidal Ecstasy, so he already understood the direction we were going for with this record.\" Pre-orders for Hideous Aftermath are available here.
