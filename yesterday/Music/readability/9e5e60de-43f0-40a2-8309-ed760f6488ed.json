The rock legend called out his neighbor and former pal during an interview with Radio Times, saying that Trump changed after becoming the American president. Get Rod Stewart Tickets Here “I’m not a great fan of Trump,” Stewart explained. “I knew him very, very well. I used to go to his house.” The two are virtually neighbors in Palm Beach, Florida, with Stewart revealing that “I live literally half a mile away. We’re both on the beach. I used to go to his Christmas parties. He’s always been a bit of a man’s man. I liked him for that. But he didn’t, as far as I’m concerned, treat women very well… Since he became president, he became another guy. Somebody I didn’t know.” Also among the issues that caused Stewart to sever his ties with Trump: the president’s stance on the Middle East. “No, I can’t anymore,” the artist said about considering Trump a friend. “As long as he’s selling arms to the Israelis — and he still is. How’s that war ever gonna stop? “Someone’s gotta do something,” Stewart continued. “What [Israeli President] Netanyahu is doing to the Palestinians is exactly what happened to the Jews. It’s annihilation, and that’s all he wants to do — get rid of them all. I don’t know how they sleep at night.” Stewart, who’s set to headline Glastonbury later on this month, recently revealed that he gargles rum and Coke before every performance. “Been drinking that 40 years,” he explained. “I never drink it any other time… The vocal cords need a lot of looking after. I mean, they’re absolute gold.” The singer resumes his 2025 North American tour on July 3rd at the Quebec City Summer Festival in Quebec, Canada. Stewart has dates in Philadelphia, Toronto, Nashville and more before wrapping up in St. Louis on August 15. Get tickets here.
