The tour kicks off on February 13 at the Brooklyn Monarch in Brooklyn, NY, and wraps up on March 3 at The Forge in Joliet, IL. Tickets are available here. \"If it were only up to us, the band, we'd play for you all, everywhere, in a heartbeat, if only we could,\" wrote Týr guitarist and vocalist Heri Joensen. \"On our last North American run, we got a lot of requests about playing in this and that city that was not on our route. \"We're very happy that this time we get to do a second round visiting a lot of those cities that our dear fans requested. Get your tickets early. It would be a shame if we miss you. And since the VIP upgrade experience went down well last time, we decided to do it again, so we can hang out together and play an acoustic show for you.\" 2/13 Brooklyn Monarch Brooklyn, NY2/14 Broken Goblet Bensalem, PA2/15 Hooligans Jacksonville, NC2/16 The Orpheum Tampa, FL2/18 Southport Hall New Orleans, LA2/19 House Of Rock Corpus Christi, TX2/20 89th Street Collective Oklahoma City, OK2/21 Launchpad Albuquerque, NM2/22 The Marquis Denver, CO2/26 Constellation Room Santa Ana, CA2/27 Whisky-A-Go-Go West Hollywood, CA2/28 Goldfield Trading Post Roseville, CA3/1 Metro Music Hall Salt Lake City, UT3/2 The Black Sheep Colorado Springs, CO3/3 The Granada Lawrence, KS3/4 Amsterdam Bar \u0026 Hall St. Paul, MN3/5 The Forge Joliet, IL Want More Metal?
