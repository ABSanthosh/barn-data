  "text": "Spotify has officially reached 100 million paying subscribers in Europe.That’s according to a LinkedIn post from co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek, who said he shared news of the milestone at an event in Stockholm this week.Spotify reported on April 29 that it grew its global Premium Subscriber base to 268 million paying users in Q1 (the three months ended March 31).That was up 12% YoY, and up by 5 million net subscribers on the 263 million that SPOT counted at the end of the prior quarter (Q4 2024).The company projected that its total Premium Subscriber base will hit 273 million in Q2 of this year (the three months ended June 30), an addition of approximately 5 million net new subscribers in the quarter.Ek said in his social media post today (May 27) that Europe is now home to nearly “40% of [Spotify’s] global premium subscriber base”.Spotify’s most recent earnings presentation (for Q1, 2025) included a chart confirming that Europe accounted for 37% (or 99.16m) of its total subscriber base in Q1.Latin America and ‘Rest of World’ accounted for 23% and 14%, respectively.North America, meanwhile, accounted for 26%, which suggests that the platform counted 69.68 million Premium Subscribers in North America as of Q1 2025.Spotify’s earnings report didn’t break out the percentage for the US and Canada individually.Spotify recently said that its US iOS app update, approved by Apple earlier this month, drove “a significant increase” in conversions from free to Premium subscriptions in the market.Sharing the news on LinkedIn today (May 27), Daniel Ek said: “Once a year, we open the doors to our Stockholm HQ to welcome guests from across Europe. This year, I had the chance to take everyone through Spotify’s founding journey, a story I’ve told many times, but one that still feels special.“What made this time different was that I also got to share a huge milestone: Spotify has now reached 100 million paying subscribers in Europe.”Credit: Sipa US/Alamy“When we launched in 2008, we did so market by market, trying to explain to our partners what streaming could become. Back then, just getting to one million paying users in Europe in 2011 felt like a huge win.”Daniel EkEk added: “When we launched in 2008, we did so market by market, trying to explain to our partners what streaming could become. Back then, just getting to one million paying users in Europe in 2011 felt like a huge win. Fast forward to today, and Europe is home to nearly 40% of our global Premium subscriber base.“The growth is incredible, but what matters even more is the connection we’ve built along the way. With our users, who’ve made Spotify part of their daily lives, and the connections that’s made between fans, artists, authors and creators, every single day. I’m super proud of what we’ve built and so excited about what’s next. 🙏”In Europe, Spotify recently implemented price increases for subscribers across Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.This marks the second major price adjustment for Spotify in the Benelux region since July 2023 when the company rolled out price increases across North America, Europe, and Asia.In the Netherlands and Luxembourg, an individual subscription now costs €12.99 (USD $14.81 at the current exchange rate), up 18% from €10.99.The price increase in the Benelux region now exceeds the prices of Spotify’s services in larger neighboring economies. In comparison, individual plans in Germany and Spain remain at €10.99, while French subscribers pay €11.12 ($12.66). Switzerland, meanwhile, is priced higher at 13.95 CHF ($17.04) for an individual subscription. Music Business Worldwide",
