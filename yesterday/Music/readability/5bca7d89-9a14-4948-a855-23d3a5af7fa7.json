  "text": "Ariana Grande has announced the passing of her beloved grandmother, Marjorie “Nonna” Grande. She was 99 years old. “We are devastated to share that the beloved matriarch of our family has passed away,” the singer and her family shared in a statement on Tuesday. “Marjorie (Nonna) Grande passed peacefully in her home and was surrounded by her family and loved ones for every moment of her last few weeks. We thank you for your love, support, and for respecting our privacy as we grieve and celebrate her beautiful, extraordinary life.” Last year, at the age of 98, Nonna made history as the oldest person featured on a Billboard Hot 100-charting single, thanks to her spoken word appearance on her granddaughter’s song “Ordinary Things.” She also cameoed on Ariana’s songs “Daydreamin'” and “bloodline.”",
