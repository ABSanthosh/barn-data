  "text": "Sun Don't Shine – the band featuring Type O Negative guitarist Kenny Hickey and drummer Johnny Kelly alongside current Crowbar frontman Kirk Windstein and ex-Crowbar bassist Todd Strange that used to be called Eye Am – is now streaming their new single \"The Promise Song\". \"This one was a real example of shooting from the hip. I had the basic framework for the song having no real idea how it was going to come out,\" said Hickey. \"Then Kirk laid his tracks and turned the bridge into a totally different animal, intensifying everything, and laid down a stellar guitar lead that deepened the entire track.\" \"Brace yourself for a sonic storm,\" added Corpse Paint Records' Andrew Spaulding. \"This new track 'The Promise Song' fuses raw power and haunting melody, a collision of legendary talent that redefines the genre and sets the stage for a new era of heavy music.\" Get \"The Promise Song\" physical copies and merchandise right here.
