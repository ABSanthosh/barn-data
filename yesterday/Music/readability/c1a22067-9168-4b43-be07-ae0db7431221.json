  "text": "British actor Paapa Essiedu, best known for his roles in I May Destroy You and Black Mirror, is reportedly in talks to play Professor Severus Snape in HBO’s upcoming Harry Potter television series, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Snape was famously played by the late Alan Rickman in the Harry Potter film franchise. Essiedu’s involvement is reflective of HBO’s previously stated commitment of putting together an “inclusive, diverse” cast. Essiedu is the second known actor attached to the TV series; Mark Rylance is reportedly in talks to star as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore. The Harry Potter TV series is described as a faithful adaptation of the book franchise featuring an entirely new cast. Each season will be tied to a specific book in the series, meaning the series will run seven seasons. Succession alum Francesca Gardiner has been tapped as showrunner, while Mark Mylod is attached to direct multiple episodes. Meanwhile, despite publicly feuding with cast members of the film franchise over her anti-trans views, Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling is “very involved” in the developing of the television series.",
