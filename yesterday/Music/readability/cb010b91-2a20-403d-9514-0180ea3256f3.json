  "text": "It’s time to mentally prepare for the final season of the international Netflix hit Squid Game, which based on this first teaser for the upcoming Season 3, still has a few surprises in store. Beginning with the reveal of Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) being returned to his fellow players in a coffin (don’t worry, he’s alive), the new footage teases some new games and plenty of violence (sanctioned and otherwise). Season 1 of Squid Game was a global phenomenon that received 14 Emmy nominations and won six in 2022. (Season 2, released last December, will compete in this year’s Emmys, while Season 3 won’t be eligible until the 2026 awards.) Seasons 1 and 2 of the show are Netflix’s most popular non-English-language titles of all time. Without getting too much into spoilers for the end of Squid Game Season 2, creator Hwang Dong-hyuk left the series on quite a cliffhanger, with the games disrupted by the players fighting back. While it seems like order has been restored to some degree in Season 3, who knows how long that will last — or what Gi-hun has planned for future rebellion. Check out the trailer for the third and final season of Squid Game below, and also read our deep dive on the hard work that goes into dubbing the show into English. Season 3 premieres June 27th.",
