  "text": "Marc Maron has joined the cast of the forthcoming Bruce Springsteen biopic—and Jeremy Allen White vehicle—Deliver Me From Nowhere, Variety reports. The comedian, podcast host, and actor will portray producer Chuck Plotkin, who painstakingly mastered Springsteen’s pivotal 1982 album, Nebraska—a process that required Plotkin converting unprocessed cassette demos into high-quality audio.Gabby Hoffmann and David Krumholtz have also joined the film; Hoffmann will portray Springsteen’s mother, Adele, who died earlier this year at the age of 98. Krumholtz will take on the role of record label executive Al Teller, who dealt with the release of Nebraska.Deliver Me From Nowhere is directed by Scott Cooper, who penned the script based on Warren Zanes’ book of the same name. The film is more of a memoir than a full-blown biopic; it specifically captures Springsteen during the tumultuous period that led to the creation and release of Nebraska. The movie is currently filming in Springsteen’s home state of New Jersey, as well as New York.In addition to Jeremy Allen White in the leading role, the cast also includes Paul Walter Hauser, Odessa Young, Stephen Graham, Johnny Cannizzaro, Harrison Gilbertson, and Jeremy Strong—the latter of whom plays Springsteen’s longtime manager Jon Landau. Springsteen and his manager are closely involved in the making of the movie, and photos recently circulated of Springsteen visiting the film set in Bayonne, New Jersey.",
