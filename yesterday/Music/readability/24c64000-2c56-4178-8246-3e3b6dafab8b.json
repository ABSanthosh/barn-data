  "text": "Alabama Shakes—the trio of vocalist and guitarist Brittany Howard, guitarist Heath Fogg, and bassist Zac Cockrell—played a surprise reunion set in December, and, now, they have announced that they’re going on tour for the first time since 2017. The band will tour North America in the summer, with support from Sam Evian, El Michels Affair, Shannon \u0026 the Clams, Lee Fields, and others. See all of Alabama Shakes’ tour dates below.In a press statement, Brittany Howard said: “Last year, Heath, Zac, and I started chatting about how much fun it would be to make music together and tour again as Alabama Shakes. This band and these songs have been such a source of joy for all of us. It is crazy that it has been 10 years since we released Sound \u0026 Color and eight years since we played a show. But, we didn’t want this to entirely be a look back. We wanted it to be as much about the future as the past. So we have a bunch of new music that will be released soon. We just can’t wait to experience that ‘feeling’ when we start playing those first few notes of ‘Don’t Wanna Fight’ or ‘Gimme All Your Love.’”As Howard mentioned, in her statement, Alabama Shakes shared their second studio album, Sound \u0026 Color, in April 2015. According to a press release, the band has been working on new material with producer Shawn Everett.Since the most recent Alabama Shakes album, Howard has released two solo albums, Jaime and What Now.
