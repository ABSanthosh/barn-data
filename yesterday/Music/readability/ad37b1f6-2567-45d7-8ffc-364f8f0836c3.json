L-R: Daniel Byrnes, Shawn Holiday, Jiggi, Nate Albert, Matt LaMotte Courtesy of Giant Music Warner Chappell Music and Giant Music Publishing have signed Jiggi to a joint publishing deal. He is best known as co-writer on Cash Cobain, Bay Swag and Ice Spice‘s “Fisherrr,” which has already generated 418,000 song consumption equivalents since its April release, as well as B Lovee and Cash Cobain’s “All Alone.” Giant Music had been aware of Jiggi before “Fisherrr” took off because of his work with Slizzy Entertainment artists Cash Cobain and Vontee the Singer (on the track “Face2Face”), as well as his older cuts with UnoTheActivist. In addition to Cash Cobain and Vontee The Singer, Jiggi is currently working with Headie One, Sheff G, Lil Tecca and wolfacejoeyy.  He also helped executive produce Kenzo’s Spring Summer ’25 fashion show for Paris Fashion Week in June, as well as Who Decides War’s Spring Summer ’25 fashion show for New York Fashion Week with Cobain in September.  “Jiggi is someone who’s always shown promise and ambition since we started working with him via ‘Fisherrr,’” Giant Music’s Shawn Holiday and Daniel Byrnes said in a joint statement, adding that the deal closed at the end of September. “We’re extremely happy to be partnering with Warner Chappell on an exciting producer like this and look forward to bringing more hits to the world produced by Jiggi.” Trending on Billboard Shortly after its launch in 2021, Giant Music Publishing made its first signing with Grammy-winning songwriter and producer DJ SwanQo (a.k.a. James Steed), who co-produced and wrote Cardi B‘s “Up,” among other tracks. That deal was also in partnership with Warner Chappell. Daily newsletters straight to your inbox Sign Up More From Pro",
