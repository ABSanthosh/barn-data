  "text": "Jonathan Mayers, who as co-founder of Superfly Entertainment helped create the Bonnaroo and Outside Lands music festivals, has died, according to Billboard. A cause of death was not immediately known at the time of publication. Mayers co-founded the marketing and event company Superfly alongside Rick Farman, Richard Goodstone, and Kerry Black in 1996. Together with Ashley Capps of AC Entertainment, music agent Chip Hooper, and manager Coran Capshaw, they launched Bonnaroo in 2002. Thanks to Bonnaroo’s early success, Superfly and AC Entertainment went on to create the Vegoose Music Festival in Las Vegas. Superfly also partnered with Another Planet Entertainment to launch the Outside Lands Music Festival in San Francisco. Through his work with Superfly, Mayers was also involved in Comedy Central’s Clusterfest, Project Pabst, and The Great GoogaMooga, among other events. Mayers’ relationship with Superfly came to a tumultuous end in August 2021, when he was terminated from the company. He later sued his former partners for civil misrepresentation, breach of contract, and fraud, but a judge dismissed the lawsuit in January 2023.",
