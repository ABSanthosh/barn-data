  "text": "Saturday Night Live has revealed the lineup for its final episodes of 2024, including its annual Christmas episode which will be hosted by Martin Short. Short briefly served as a cast member on SNL from 1984 to 1985 and has hosted the show four times, including in 2022 alongside his Only Murders in the Building co-star Steve Martin. While he’s listed as the sole host for SNL’s 2024 Christmas episode, set for December 21st, he’ll undoubtedly be joined by a slew of special guests, as per tradition. Meanwhile, Hozier will serve as the evening’s musical guest. The prior week’s episode, slated for December 14th, will see SNL alum Chris Rock return to host for a fourth time alongside musical guest Gracie Abrams, while make her debut appearance. This weekend’s episode of SNL on December 7th features Gladiator II star Paul Mescal as host and Shaboozey as musical guest. Head here for all of our coverage of SNL Season 50, including why Marcello Hernández’s Domingo is the character SNL needed in the TikTok age.",
