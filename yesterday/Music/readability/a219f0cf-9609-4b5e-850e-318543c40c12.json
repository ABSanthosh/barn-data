  "text": "Taylor Barber, vocalist for Left To Suffer and Seven Hours After Violet, has come under fire for allegedly not delivering on vocal lessons fans paid for. One fan posted a lengthy thread on Reddit explaining that they had paid for lessons that never happened, while others chimed in via the comments saying they had similar experiences. Barber has since addressed the issue via a lengthy statement, acknowledging that he neglected the vocal lessons and is currently issuing refunds. Barber said in a caption to the below statement: \"I feel terrible for my negligence in keeping up with these lessons. Promise I never have malicious intentions. I am very sorry. I have gathered the info for refunds if you need please message me. These mistakes won’t happen again.\" He continued: \"To address the story that has been posted about me: Yes I failed to hold up my end of the bargain on some of my vocal lessons in the past from about 3 years ago. Yes I take full responsibility for my actions and I am extremely sorry to anyone I have upset in this process. The money will be refunded to anyone that didn't get their lesson and if they want their lesson i'm happy to still give it. At no time was this to take money from anyone but with touring and recording in all my projects time just gets away from me and I apologize. \"I love music more than anything and I respect everyone at any level who gets the joy to create and release themselves through sound. I have neglected my responsibilities and I am going to right my wrongs and refund anyone with outstanding debts i need to pay, and will never let anyone slip though the crack again. Again I am extremely sorry and take this matter very seriously. Love you all dearly and hope to see you soon.\" I feel terrible for my negligence in keeping up with these lessons. Promise I never have malicious intentions. I am very sorry. I have gathered the info for refunds if you need please message me. These mistakes won’t happen again. @lambgoat @MetalcoreMods pic.twitter.com/jDNRCM1nMz— Taylor Barber (@taylorsuffers) December 4, 2024 Want More Metal?
