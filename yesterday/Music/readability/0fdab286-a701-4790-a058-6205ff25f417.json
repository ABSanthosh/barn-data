  "text": "A Donald Trump impersonator pushed Alec Baldwin too far, as seen in a new Twitter video, leading to a nasty confrontation between the two men. In the video, Jason Scoop, an online content creator who often impersonates Trump, approaches Baldwin as the actor loads luggage into a car. Wasting no time, Scoop starts slinging insults and crass jokes at Baldwin, slamming his Saturday Night Live Trump impression and pretending to offer him a pardon for the October 2021 involuntary shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the film Rust — which Scoop characterizes as “murdering that woman in cold blood.” Clearly reaching his limit, Baldwin stops ignoring the troll and addresses him directly. “If the camera wasn’t here, I’d snap your fucking neck,” Baldwin can be heard saying after reminding Scoop that they were standing outside of the building where his kids live. See the full clip, shared by Scoop, below. Baldwin’s Rust criminal case concluded late last year when the Arizona attorney general’s office said that it “did not intend to exhaustively pursue the appeal on behalf of the prosecution.” Prior to that decision, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer dismissed Baldwin’s case in July after determining that the prosecutor’s office withheld crucial evidence that may have explained how live ammunition ended up on the film’s set. Hutchins’ family stated that it still intends to pursue a civil case against Baldwin and the film’s producers. Read more about the case’s details here.
