  "text": "Amenra is back with two brand new EPs, each in their own distinct style! Amenra will release both De Toorn and With Fang And Claw on March 28. De Toorn channels the heaviness of Amenra's record De Doorn, while With Fang And Claw goes back to what Amenra was ushering into the world with Mass I through Mass IIII. Amenra is now streaming \"Forlorn\", the opening track from With Fang And Claw, alongside a stunning short film by artist Amorphokyria who not only stars in the video, but also directed it from Tbilisi, Georgia while the crew and dancers protested their government in between shooting— day and night. \"With Fang And Claw explores our earlier work, and merges with our contemporary being, setting the direction to what will soon become our MASS VII.\" said Amenra vocalist Colin Van Eeckhout. \"'Forlorn' made me contemplate our communal past. I reached back and looked at everything we have lived together, how we stayed together through thick and thin. I cherish every single moment we have still. We write it all down, record almost everything that slowly pours out of us. And in due time, we and all will disappear, until there is nothing left of us.\" Amenra guitarist Lennart Bossu adds: \"A song often starts as the vision of one person. But with 'Forlorn,' Mathieu and I created something that felt equally ours – effortless, natural. Some songs take time to take shape, to find their true form. But this one clicked instantly. Just weeks later, we were already in the studio, capturing what had come to life.\" De Toorn and With Fang And Claw were in a single session at the same studio in the Belgian Ardennes where the band's massive Mass VI was recorded with Seth Manchester (Machines With Magnets).
