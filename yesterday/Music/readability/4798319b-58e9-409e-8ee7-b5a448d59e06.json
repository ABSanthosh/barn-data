Pharrell Williams acknowledges applause after presenting creations for the Louis Vuitton Menswear Ready-to-wear Fall-Winter 2024/2025 collection as part of the Paris Fashion Week, in Paris on Jan. 16, 2024. ALAIN JOCARD/AFP via Getty Images Don Toliver and J-Hope previewed their new Pharrell-produced collaboration “LV Bag” during the Louis Vuitton FW25 show in Paris on Tuesday (Jan. 21). Pharrell and his frequent collaborator Nigo walked out and greeted J-Hope and other notable front row spectators such as Travis Scott and Bradley Cooper while the song was playing. J-Hope already teased “new music on the way” this year in his “Beginning of a New Dream” YouTube video, with the “2025. 03.” caption suggesting a new song will be out in March. It would mark J-Hope’s first new track since his discharge from the army last October and first release since his six-track EP Hope On the Street Vol. 1 last March, which featured collabs with his BTS bandmate Jungkook on “I Wonder,” Benny Blanco and Nile Rodgers on “Lock/Unlock,” and Le Sserafim’s Huh Yunjin on “I Don’t Know.” Trending on Billboard Toliver released his latest album Hardstone Psycho in June, which featured collabs with his Cactus Jack label boss Travis Scott, Kodak Black, Charlie Wilson, Cash Cobain, Future, Metro Boomin, Teezo Touchdown, Lil Uzi Vert and Yeat. It became his first No. 1 on Top R\u0026B/Hip-Hop Albums and reached No. 3 on the Billboard 200. The Weeknd and Playboi Carti‘s Billboard Hot 100 No. 3 hit “Timeless,” which Pharrell also co-produced, also played during the show. SEVENTEEN‘s unreleased “Bad Influence” and Final Fantasy VII’s “One-Winged Angel” were also included in the show’s soundtrack.
