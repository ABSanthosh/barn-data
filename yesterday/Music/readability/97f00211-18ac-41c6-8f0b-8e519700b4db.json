  "text": "Sometimes a guitar you ordered gets lost in the mail. Other times it gets accidentally delivered to Jim Root of Slipknot despite the fact that you are currently located in Qatar. Shit happens, right? In a now-deleted Reddit post originally captured by MusicRadar, someone who works on the US Air Base in Qatar ordered themselves a brand new Jackson guitar from Sweetwater. Three weeks later and the person received an empty case wth no guitar, prompting the person to reach out to Sweetwater to see what was happening. This is where thing get weird. \"I contacted my sales rep and I got a semi-canned response, 'Sorry for the confusion and inconvenience,' with the added checking with the warehouse and shipping departments to try and figure out where the guitar is,\" wrote the person. \"Now I am impatiently awaiting a tracking number or word of where the guitar is.\"\" Unfortunately the USPS tracking number provided went dead and the guitar seemed lost… until it wasn't. \"All hope was lost in recovering it and I was waiting for another one to get in stock when my sales engineer emailed me this,” read a follow-up post with a screenshot of an email that read: \"Hey (name redacted), you might laugh a little. For some reason, the post office shipped your guitar to Jim Root of Slipknot. We are working on the solution now.\" No word on if the person got their guitar (hopefully signed by Root), but I think the bigger question here is how the hell did this get to Jim Root? Mysteries abound, and hopefully we'll get some resolution. Or that person at least gets their guitar. Want More Metal?
