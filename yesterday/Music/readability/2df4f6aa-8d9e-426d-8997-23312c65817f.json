  "text": "25 years is a long time to be in the game. And to start as a teenager in the music industry, and to have a career that spans over two decades, you're bound to mature, and reflect. Papa Roach's frontman Jacoby Shaddix did some reflection of his own during an interview with X107.5 Las Vegas' Carlota, \"I'm so a million miles from that person.\" Particularly focusing on the period after the band's hit single, \"Last Resort\" was released in 2000, Shaddix explained that he \"always cared about people,\" but that he was \"young and reckless.\" And in his recklessness, he had to have \"a certain amount of… narcissism, in a way, to be able to do this thing.\" As one grows older, hindsight becomes clearer, and so Shaddix was able to elaborate \"there are threads and a common bond,\" between who he is now and who he was then; he's still compassionate, but he's not quite as reckless – especially after Ozzy Osbourne's wife Sharon Osbourne ripped him an absolute new one in 2001. After trashing Ozzfest in 2001, Shaddix had a much \"needed\" wake-up call from Sharon – \"I needed to be rattled at that point because it's, like I could have totally gotten in a lot of trouble – a lot worse trouble than I had gotten in at the time. And I learned my lessons, and they were valuable lessons.\" Fans had destroyed the venue during an onstage riot during the festival with Slipknot and Ozzy still due to play after Papa Roach's set, so Sharon let loose – \"I had this verbal assassination from Mrs. Osbourne. Don't fuck with Sharon.\" Through some well-deserved scolding, and a bit of maturity, Papa Roach's Jacoby Shaddix really has come a long way over the last 25 years. He even celebrated his 13th year free from alcohol earlier this year. With a few remaining live dates in the US, you can catch Papa Roach on the road over the next few days. They will also be embarking on another North American tour later this year. Check out the remaining cities for the current tour below.
