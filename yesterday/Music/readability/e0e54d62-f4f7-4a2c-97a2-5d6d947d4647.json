  "text": "The two couples seemingly met up for dinner at BondST, where they were photographed Friday night (Dec. 27). Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are seen on Oct. 11, 2024 in New York City. XNY/Star Max/GC Images Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce had a post-holiday night out in New York City with Jack Antonoff and Margaret Qualley on Friday night (Dec. 27), based on photos that circulated Saturday. Photographer @josiahwphotos (on Instagram) posted images of Swift and Kelce’s arrival to NoHo restaurant BondST, and their departure after dinner. Additional photos showed Antonoff, Swift’s close friend and longtime producer, and wife Qualley joining the couple. Swift’s dinner look (seen in pictures here) was led by an oversized wool blazer with padded shoulders by Stella McCartney, a piece with cage paneling along the hem that’s hand-embroidered with lead-free crystals (Crystal Cage Oversize Blazer, $5,500). The shape of the blazer nods to menswear, while its embellishment, and its styling with tights and heeled boots, gives it a glimmer of femininity. Trending on Billboard BondST is a hot spot known for its Japanese-inspired cuisine with two locations in NYC, the one in NoHo (where Swift has been seen dining with friends before) and another in Hudson Yards. The superstar wrapped her record-breaking, $2 billion-grossing Eras Tour on Dec. 8 in Vancouver. On Dec. 12, she was named the winner of 10 Billboard Music Awards, including Top Artist. With 49 total wins collected throughout her career, she’s now the most celebrated artist in the history of the BBMAs. “Thank you to the fans, because Billboard is counting your stuff. They’re counting what you listen to, the albums that you’re passionate about,” she shared in a video message that aired during the telecast. “I count these as fan-voted awards because you’re the ones who care about the albums and come see us in concert. Everything that’s happened with the Eras Tour and The Tortured Poets Department, I just have to say thank you. It means the world to me that you guys embraced the things I’ve made, and the fact that you care so much about my music … This is the nicest early birthday present you could have given me. So, thank you very much. I love it. It’s exactly what I wanted.” Swift, who turned 35 on Dec. 13, made an appearance at the Dec. 21 Chiefs game at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo., to support Kelce. Since wrapping her tour, she’s also been seen visiting patients at Kansas City’s Children’s Mercy Hospital; though she didn’t publicize her visit, patients and their families posted about her generosity online. Swift additionally made a substantial donation to Kansas City children’s non-profit Operation Breakthrough, according to the organization. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
