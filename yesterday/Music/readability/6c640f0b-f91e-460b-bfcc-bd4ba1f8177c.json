  "text": "Gang Starr have returned with a new single “Finishem,” featuring production from DJ Premier and verses from the late rapper, Guru. Released ahead of the fifth anniversary of the duo’s most recent album, One of the Best Yet, “Finishem” was built around a vocal hook recorded by Guru prior to his passing in 2010. Speaking about the single in a statement, DJ Premier said, “As One of the Best Yet was approaching the five-year anniversary mark, that milestone moved me to create a new track to match the occasion.” Continuing, Premier explained, “The album is special on so many different levels; what it meant to me, Guru’s family, and the fans, it warranted something new to honor the occasion. I started going through files, looking for something that stood out and fit; and as soon as I heard Guru’s hook — ‘Now I’m about to finishem/ My rep alone could diminish’em’ — I knew that was it and went to work crafting a beat for it.” Premier went on to detail how the beat was made. “I had some unused Antman Wonder files that I decided to check out, and one of the sounds hit me emotionally from the very first note,” he said. “I knew this was the one to shape the song. The fans always appreciate more Gang Starr — and this one is for them.” Watch the official lyric video for “Finishem” below. One of the Best Yet was released in 2019, and marked Gang Starr’s first new music in 16 years. Since then, another one-off single, “Glowing Mic,” arrived in 2020. Meanwhile, DJ Premier and Nas released the collaborative single “Define My Name” earlier this year, ahead of their yet-to-be-titled forthcoming album.",
