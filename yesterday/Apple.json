    "link": "https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/04/hands-on-with-midnight-airpods-max-with-usb-c/",
    "description": "Say what you will about AirPods Max falling behind AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4 in terms of software features, but the sonic performance of Apple’s wireless over-ear headphones remains unmatched. As much as I adore AirPods Pro 2 for their peak earbud performance and ability to go anywhere, AirPods Max always impress me when I want to hear every detail of every instrument in a song. Apple revised the hardware for the first time ever in September, replacing Lightning charging with USB-C and introducing new colors. Short of some wireless charging option, USB-C and an update from space gray to midnight topped my request list. For that reason, I turned my space gray AirPods Max with Lightning into cash and paid the difference for . Midnight is closer to black than space gray was, and the hint of blue satisfies my temptation to go for a more colorful option instead. USB-C means the same cable to powers up my iPhone and iPad now can recharge AirPods Max. The Apple TV remote and Mac keyboard and mice still use Lightning, but those need charging weekly or monthly instead of every few days. Otherwise, these are the same AirPods Max I’ve raved about since 2020. Someone else got a good deal on my old Lightning AirPods Max, and I got a cool new color and a convenience I’ll appreciate until AirPods Max 2 someday exist. For folks buying AirPods Max for the first time now, you’ll never have to wonder why they use a different charging port than new iPhones, and they sound exceptional. Anyway, read on for some hands-on shots of the new midnight finish. more…",

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00.

    "description": "Macworld The latest version of macOS–Sequoia–arrived on Macs in September 2024, but the beta development continues and if you are a registered developer or registered as a public beta tester, you can continue to get the latest updates and try out new features still not available to the general public. In this article, we’ll explain what’s in the latest beta, what you need to do to get your hands on a copy, how to install it, and what you should bear in mind if you don’t want to end up in a pickle. If you would prefer to use the latest official release of macOS Sequois here’s how to update macOS on your Mac. In the past, the developer beta was only available to developers who had paid to join Apple’s Developer Program (which costs $99/£79). However, for a couple of years now, Apple has opened up the developer beta to registered developers with free developer accounts. We explain how to get a free developer account below. Not that we recommend that you should get the beta if you aren’t a developer. Beta software tends to be buggy and a more stable public beta version is also available. If you no longer want to run the beta version of macOS read this: How to remove the macOS beta. macOS developer beta: Latest version macOS Sequoia 15.0 macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta 6 released October 7 Foundry Foundry Foundry The first version of the Sequoia developer beta of macOS 15 arrived after the WWDC keynote on June 10, 2024. Beta 2 arrived on June 24. Notable additions to beta 2 were iPhone Mirroring, the ability to directly access an iPhone through the Mac. The Mac and iPhone connect wirelessly and users see the iPhone Home screen on the Mac. Users can click and use iPhone apps, iPhone app notifications can be activated, and the appropriate iPhone app launches. Users can also drag and drop photos and videos from the iPhone to the Mac. The iPhone audio will come through the Mac’s sound output, and iPhone notifications will integrate with the macOS notifications list. iPhone Mirroring works on all M-series Macs and Intel Macs that have a T2 Security chip. The iPhone and Mac need to be signed into the same Apple Account, and Bluetooth and Wi-Fi need to be enabled. iPhone Mirroring works on all M-series Macs and Intel Macs that have a T2 Security chip. The iPhone and Mac need to be signed into the same Apple Account, and Bluetooth and Wi-Fi need to be enabled. Developer beta 4 was released on July 23. Developer beta 5 was released on August 5. Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15 developer beta 6 on August 12. Developer beta 7 was released on August 20. On August 28, Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15 beta 8. macOS Sequoia 15.1 There is a second beta running consecutively with the macOS 15.0 beta development. The macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta includes Apple Intelligence features that are only available on M-series Macs. On July 29, Apple started work on the macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta, which includes some Apple Intelligence features. The macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta 2 arrived on August 12. On August 28 macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta 3 was released to developers. On September 17, Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta 4 to developers. The macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta 5 was released to developers on September 23. The macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta 6 was released on October 6. A July 31 report by 9to5Mac states that Apple Intelligence will not run if the 15.1 beta is running on an external drive. It’s not known if this condition will remain when Apple officially releases 15.1. macOS public beta latest version macOS Sequoia 15.0 macOS Sequoia 15.1 Foundry Foundry Foundry The first public beta of Sequoia arrived on July 15, 2024. The second public beta of Sequoia arrived on July 23, 2024. The fourth public beta of Sequoia arrived on August 13, 2024. The fifth public beta of Sequoia arrived on August 20, 2024. The sixth public beta of Sequoia arrived on August 28, 2024. Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15.1 pubic beta on Septermber 19, 2024. This beta inclues the first round of Apple Intelligence features. macOS public beta vs developer beta Since 2023 the Developer Beta has been available to anyone who registers as a developer, even if they aren’t a paid-up member of Apple’s Developer Program. As a result, people with a basic free developer account are able to download the new macOS developer beta (we show you how to register below). Whether you should download the developer beta if you aren’t a developer is another question. We don’t recommend you install the developer beta if you aren’t a developer. Instead, our recommendation is to use the public beta (the first verison of which usually arrives in July). There are a few differences between the public and developer betas. The public beta is not the same as the beta that is released through the developer program. Developers get updates to their beta first, and possibly more frequently. But you should keep in mind that betas are by nature not stable, and because the public beta comes after the developer beta it could be a little safer to install. The most significant difference is probably the motive of the testers: Developers usually have the aim of ensuring their apps work when the updated macOS is released to the general public, while public beta testers are essentially helping Apple detect bugs and offering feedback on the features. Because of this developers may get to test new features not available in the public beta.  If you want to get the public beta the first thing you need to do, if you haven’t already, is join Apple’s beta programs read this for more information: How to become an Apple beta tester. Apple Apple Apple How to get a free developer account If you just want a free Apple Developer account so you can access the beta you can get this via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app on an iPhone: Get the Apple Developer App from the App Store.  Open the app on your iPhone.  Tap on Account.  Tap on Sign In.  Sign in using your usual Apple ID.  If you wish to actually publish applications to the App Store or receive support, you’ll need to pay $99/£79 per year for a paid account. You can compare the free and paid accounts here. How to get the macOS beta The Sequoia developer beta should show up on your Mac if you are running macOS Sonoma or macOS Sequoia, have paid $99/£79 to enroll in Apple’s Developer program (here) or if you have a free developer account (follow the instructions above). When the Public Beta becomes available it will also show up on your Mac, as long as you have signed up for the Public Beta program on Apple’s beta webpage, signed the NDA, and enrolled your Mac. Before you download a few warnings: We strongly advise that if you aren’t a developer you don’t download the developer beta. We also strongly recommend that you back up your Mac before you upgrade to the Sequoia beta. We recommend that you do not run Sequoia beta on your primary Mac; ideally, you run it in a separate volume. This should minimize any risks to you. How to download macOS beta Open Software Updates on your Mac. (System Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Updates.) You should see two options: Automatic Updates and Beta Updates. Click on the (i) beside Beta Updates. You can now turn on Beta Updates (if they weren’t already on). Choose the beta you want to download. If your developer account is tied to a different Apple ID to your usual one you can change that here. Click Done. Now your Mac will Check for updates and eventually show the Sequoia Developer Beta as an upgrade. Click on Upgrade Now. Foundry Foundry Foundry If you are running macOS Ventura 13.3 or earlier: Apple changed the way it delivers betas in Ventura 13.4. If you aren’t yet running that version of macOS you will need to download the macOS Developer Beta Access Utility or macOS Public Beta Access Utility. If you were already running an earlier macOS Public Beta you’ll find the new macOS beta as an upgrade via Software Update. Just click on Upgrade Now. You may have to update to the latest version of your current beta before you can do so, if not follow the steps below to get the beta access utility. If you are enrolled in the Developer Program, go to Apple’s beta download page. Click on Install Profile to download the new macOS Developer Beta Access Utility to your Mac. If you are enrolled as a public beta tester, download the macOS Public Beta Access Utility. Go to Downloads on your Mac and click on the macOS Beta Access Utility to open it. Double-click on the dmg file and the installer will run. Once the new macOS beta is installed Software Update will check to see if there are any updates. Click Update and the latest version will download. You’ll see a prompt to install the latest macOS beta, click on Continue. Agree to the Ts\u0026Cs (more on them below). Click Install. How to update macOS beta versions Once you are running the beta the updates will come through to your Mac automatically, you just need to click to install. You will receive a notification when the next update to the beta is available. Updates will be available via Software Update (in System Settings/System Preferences) Everything else you need to know about beta testing That covers how to get the betas, but once you have them what can you do, and what should you do? We’ll cover that below. Is the macOS beta stable? By its nature, a beta has the potential to be unstable. Therefore it’s not advised that you install it on a Mac that you rely on. If you have a second Mac that isn’t mission-critical then install it there. We strongly recommend that you don’t risk all by putting the macOS beta on your primary macOS, especially not in the early days of the beta development.  If you don’t have a second Mac there are a couple of ways you could run macOS beta on your Mac without running the risk of losing data or finding your Mac stops working: We recommend installing it on a partition – which these days is really a volume (and is much easier to create than a partition was). Read about how to do that here: How to dual-boot Mac: Run two versions of macOS on a Mac. Alternatively, you could install the macOS beta on an external drive and run it on that. We discuss the safety of the macOS beta and the risks you might be taking in more detail in a separate article. If the stability of the beta worries you then you are probably better off waiting until the final version is out, or at least waiting until testing has been happening for a few months before getting the beta. How to prepare your Mac for the beta Update your software: We recommend you have the latest full version of macOS installed, although Apple says that the macOS Developer Beta Access Utility requires macOS 10.8 or later. Make space: We’d recommend at least 15GB of available space because the macOS betas tend to be very large. If you end up requiring more space read: How to free up space on Mac. Note that we always recommend that you have at least 10% space free on your Mac at any time, so if you don’t have that expect problems! Back up: Before you install a beta on your Mac you should make a backup of your data and files. You can find out how to use Time Machine to back up your Mac. We also have a round-up of suitable backup solutions. How to send feedback to Apple Should you come across an error or a bug you should use the Feedback Assistant app to provide feedback to Apple. Launch the app and follow the appropriate steps, selecting the area about which you’re providing feedback and then any specific sub-area. Then describe your issue in a single sentence, before providing a more detailed description, including any specific steps that reproduce the issue. You’ll also be able to attach other files. You’ll also have to give permission for the Feedback Assistant app to collect diagnostic information from your Mac. It won’t always be obvious whether something is a bug or just not as easy to use as you might have hoped. Either way, if your feedback is that something appears to work in an illogical way, Apple will want to know that. If you are having trouble with a third-party app you can let Apple know by reporting it through the 3rd-party Application Compatibility category in the Feedback Assistant. However, we’d suggest that you also provide feedback to the app’s developer who will no doubt be grateful. Will I be able to update from macOS beta to the final version? Beta users will be able to install the final build of the OS on release day without needing to reformat or reinstall. Can I talk about the beta publicly? According to Apple and the license agreement all beta testers must agree to, the beta is “Apple confidential information”. By accepting those terms, you agree not to discuss your use of the software with anyone who isn’t also in the Beta Software Program. That means you can’t “blog, post screenshots, tweet, or publicly post information about the public beta software.” However, you can discuss any information that Apple has publicly disclosed; the company says that information is no longer considered confidential. How to downgrade from the macOS beta You can always revert to an earlier version of macOS, though depending on how you back up, it’s not necessarily a painless process. Start by making sure the data on your drive is backed up, then erase the drive and install the latest public version of macOS. When you first startup your Mac you can use the Migration Assistant to import your data from the backup. Here’s a more detailed tutorial on downgrading from the macOS beta we also have a tutorial on downgrading to an older version of the Mac OS.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2412089/ios-18-1-beta-release-date-apple-intelligence.html",
    "description": "Macworld Typically, Apple would start testing the x.1 version of a new iOS release right after the main release. We expected the iOS 18 beta to continue through the summer until its release in September, followed immediately by the iOS 18.1 beta. Then, iOS 18.1 would be released in October, and 18.2 beta testing would begin, and so on. This year is very different. More than a month ahead of the expected iOS 18 release, Apple began an iOS 18.1 beta test. It was made available for developers on July 29, but only for devices that are compatible with Apple Intelligence (iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, iPhone 16-series and M-series iPads – M-series Macs get the equivalent version of Seqioia). It’s not yet known if or when it will be available to public beta testers. Find out everything you need to know about the new iPhone update in our iOS 18 superguide. Updated October 7: The sixth beta of iOS 18.1 is out now. iOS 18.1: New features Apple’s biggest iOS 18 feature is Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI tools and Siri enhancements that will be exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, as well as later iPhones. Apple Intelligence is coming to Macs with Apple Silicon as well. Apple Intelligence features are coming in sort of a phased rollout: some features were intended to be available with the launch of iOS 18, some later in 2024, and some in an update in the spring of 2025. Apple’s plans have changed a bit, with the first wave of Apple Intelligence features coming in iOS 18.1, which will probably arrive in October. We have a guide to which features are coming at what time. The following features are available in the initial iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 beta test: AI writing tools New and improved Siri Mail features like smart replies and email summaries Natural language in photos Call recording and transcription Safari web page summaries Clean Up tool in Photos The following AI features are not in the iOS 18.1 beta: ChatGPT integration Image Playground Genmoji Advanced Siri features like on-screen awareness, personal context, and actions within apps The image features were said to arrive at launch, but more recent reports say it will come later this year in iOS 18.2 or 18.3. ChatGPT integration should arrive around that time, too. The advanced Siri stuff is coming in early 2025. Beta 2 added the iOS 18 changes that came in iOS 18 beta 5. Namely, some improvements to the new Photos app interface and Safari’s “Hide Distracting Items” feature. There are new splash screens throughout iOS to describe new features in various apps. Beta 3 added the “Clean Up” tool in Photos, but none of the other generative AI image capabilities. Beta 4 added support for older iPhone models. The call recording and transcription feature appears to work on earlier iPhone models, rather than only on those that support Apple Intelligence (iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 models). It also adds a dedicated camera mode for Spatial Photos. Beta 5 expanded RCS to a few additional carriers, adds drag-and-drop support when using iPhone Mirroring on a Mac, and new Control Center controls (including individual Wi-Fi and VPN toggles). Beta 6 adds warnings for sleep apnea and breathing disturbances, along with four new Control Center controls: AirDrop, Satellite, Measure, and Level. iOS 18.1: Requirements The iOS 18.1 beta is currently locked behind a waitlist. When it was first released, users who download the iOS 18.1 developer beta were greeted with the following message: iOS 18.1 beta is an early preview of an update to iOS 18 that will be available later this fall. This beta introduces an initial set of features powered by Apple Intelligence. To try the Apple Intelligence beta, join the waitlist in Settings and you will be notified as soon as it is ready for your device. Both device language and Siri language must be set to US English, and device region must be set to United States. As noted, Apple Intelligence is only available on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max in U.S. English, and of course on iPhone 16 models. Due to the Digital Markets Act, Apple Intelligence is blocked in the EU, but version 2 of the beta made a workaround possible to access the features in that region (Apple Intelligence is available on Macs in the EU). Apple Intelligence is also blocked in China. iOS 18.1: How to install the iOS beta The iOS 18.1 beta is currently only available for developers, but anyone can get it. Beginning with iOS 17, you don’t need to be in the $99 per year developer program to access the developer beta. A free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app: Download the Apple Developer App from the App Store. Open the app. Tap on Account. Sign in using your usual Apple ID. Registered developers can choose to get the iOS 18.1 beta instead by going to the Settings app, then General \u003e Software Update, and selecting iOS Developer Beta in the Beta Updates tab. When you return to the main Software Update screen, you’ll Upgrade to iOS 18 at the bottom of the screen under the Also Available heading. Tap that and it’ll take you to the iOS 18.1 beta. As always, remember to back up your iPhone before you install the beta. If you want to run the public beta, follow these steps: Head to beta.apple.com and register your Apple ID for the beta. Go to Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Update \u003e Beta Updates and select the beta you wish to install. Follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the beta.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2479598/airpods-max-drop-to-under-400-on-eve-of-prime-day.html",
    "description": "Macworld It’s just about the perfect time to get yourself a new pair of AirPods Max since the headphones are down to $399 right now at Amazon, a mighty savings of $150 off the MSRP. These headphones are some of our favorites, earning a 4-star rating following our review, with our expert praising the great sound quality, the top-notch active noise canceling, and the overall build and materials used. One thing we really didn’t like was that they were too pricey, but that’s obviously not going to be a problem considering the deep price slash it just received. The headphone’s ANC feature is, as mentioned, pretty fantastic, including Apple’s excellent Transparency mode. As we wrote in our review, “Most high-end noise-canceling headphones have some sort of transparency mode that leaves noise canceling active but uses the microphones to pipe in a bit of outside sound, so you can hold a quick conversation or hear other important sounds around you. Apple’s transparency mode is light-years ahead of everyone else’s. It sounds more clear, natural, and normal than any other noise-cancelling headphones I have ever used. It’s almost like not wearing headphones at all, except you can still hear your music.” Another cool feature you’ll enjoy when your headphones get delivered is the dynamic head tracking, something that will give you an immersive experience when listening to supported shows and movies, or even music, making it feel as if it’s coming from all around you. Just note: This deal is for the Lightning model, which was discontinued in September and replaced with a USB-C model. But other than a fw new colors, that’s the only change. So take the chance to get the AirPods Max for $400 at Amazon in this early Prime Day deal. Get the AirPods Max for close to their best priceBuy it now at Amazon",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2479827/get-ready-the-m4-mac-era-starts-on-november-1.html",
    "description": "Macworld Ever since the M4 chip made its debut in the iPad Pro, we’ve been wondering when the chip will eventually make its way to the Mac. We’ve long expected them to arrive in October, but according to a new report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, we now know exactly when. Gurman has reported that M4 Macs will arrive this fall, but now Gurman offers some specifics, stating that an announcement will be made around the end of this month, with “at least some of them” shipping on November 1. The new Macs that were previously rumored to ship first are the MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac. Gurman doesn’t specify which Macs are to be included in the “some of them” group, but he has reported in the past that the M4 Pro version of the Mac mini may not be available at the same time as the base M4. Speculating further based on his reports, it could indicate that the November 1 date applies to the base M4 Macs and that the M4 Pro and Max MacBook Pros will also have a later ship date. Also consider that when Apple shipped the M3 MacBook Pro last year, the company shipped the base M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max models at the same time, so it’s possible Apple will do that again with the M4 series MacBook Pro and hold the M4 Pro Mac mini for some other reason. Gurman also reported that the M4 MacBook Air will ship in the “first half” of 2025. The M4 Mac Studio will follow with a middle of 2025 release (probably WWDC in June) and the Mac Pro “in the second half” of 2025. Then in late 2025, Apple will start the M5 Mac release cycle. For more information about the Mac schedule, read our M4 Mac lineup and release timeline.",

    "title": "Apple’s October Event: Likely date and product launches",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/1064916/apple-october-event-date-time-mac-ipad.html",
    "description": "Macworld Apple holds events at certain intervals in the year at which it announces new products. The company tends to hold a March or April spring event, the WWDC keynote in June, an event to celebrate the new iPhone launch in September, and a late fall event in October at which it has been known to release new iPads and Macs. The company has even held an event as late as November 10 (in 2020 when it unveiled the first batch of M1 Macs). Apple introduced the new iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10 and AirPods 4 at an event on September 12. Has the company finished releasing new products for 2024? No! We think there are more new products to come and we could see new Macs and iPads at an Apple event in October 2024. When is Apple’s October event 2024? 29 October – estimate Last year Apple held an event on 30 October. Dubbed Scary Fast, probably due to its proximity to Halloween (in fact if you aren’t in North or South America this event will start after midnight on 31 October.) This was quite late for an Apple event (late in the month and late in the day – especially if you weren’t in the U.S. We hope that the event won’t be another late one, in terms of the hour, but it does look like it might be held in the last week of October. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has suggested that the event will happen in late October, with new products launching on November 1. He has also suggested that iOS 18.1 and, by association, macOS Sequoia 15.1 will arrive on Monday October 28. Over the years Apple has held many second fall events in October (and once in November). It has launched new Macs, iPads, and AirPods at these events. For example, at the 2021 Unleashed event we got the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro and the third-gen AirPods, while the previous year brought the M1 versions of the 13-inch MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini on Tuesday, November 10. However, as you can see from the list of October event dates below, Apple does not always hold an October event. Over the past 12 years, Apple has held eight October events, so it’s not unprecedented to skip it. 2023: Monday, October 30 2022: No event 2021: Monday, October 18 2020: Tuesday, October 13 and Tuesday, November 10 2019: No event 2018: Tuesday, October 30 2017: No event 2016: Thursday, October 27 2015: No event 2014: Thursday, October 16 2013: Tuesday, October 22 2012: Tuesday, October 23 2011: Tuesday, October 4 What time will Apple’s October event start? Apple’s Scary Fast October event in October 2023 started at a different time to the usual 10 a.m. PT. Instead, Apple kicked off the event at 5 p.m. PT. This was a much later time than usual – past midnight in Europe – so we hope for a more appropriate time in 2024. Usually, Apple events kick off at 10 a.m. in California, which is: U.S.: at 10 am (PST/PDT), 11 am (MST/MDT), noon (CST/CDT), 1 pm (EST/EDT) Canada: as above, and 2 pm (AST/ADT) U.K.: at 6 pm (GMT/BST) Europe: at 7pm (CET/CEST), 8 pm (EET/EEST) India: at 10.30 pm (IST) Australia: Next day at 1 am (AWST/AWDT), 2.30 am (ACST/ACDT), 3 am (AEST/AEDT) New Zealand: Next day at 5 am (NZST/NZDT) If Apple sticks with the ‘scary’ timings of 2023, here’s what that translates to around the world. U.S.: 5 p.m. (PDT), 6 p.m. (MDT), 7 p.m. (CDT), 8 p.m. (EDT) U.K.: Next day at 12 a.m. (GMT) Europe: Next day at 1 a.m. (CET) Canada: 5 p.m. (PDT), 6 p.m. (MDT), 7 p.m. (CDT), 8 p.m. (EDT), 9 p.m. (ADT) India: Next day at 5.30 a.m. Singapore and China: Next day at 8 a.m. Australia: Next day at 8 a.m. (AWST), 10.30 a.m. (ACDT), 11 a.m. (AEDT), 10 a.m (AEST) New Zealand: Next day at 1 p.m. (NZDT) Apple’s special events usually last between one and two hours. How to watch the Apple event If you want to watch an Apple event live, Apple will stream the keynote on its website and YouTube channel. We will also embed the video above so you can also watch it here. What will Apple launch at the October event? Whether there’s an event or not, it is possible that Apple could unveil new Macs and iPads in October. In fact, there are a number of reports predicting that it will do so before the end of the year. Mac mini with M4 \u0026 M4 Pro The Mac mini may get an update to M4 and M4 Pro, missing a generation and replacing the M2 and M2 Pro Mac mini introduced in January 2023. Some big changes are expected: the Mac mini could be even smaller, but this may mean fewer ports. More here: M4 Mac mini rumors MacBook Pro with M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max It’s been a year since Apple updated the MacBook Pro with M3-series chips, so M4 MacBook Pro models are possible this fall. More here: M4 MacBook Pro rumors Mac Studio with M4 Max and M4 Ultra It’s been more than a year since the M2-series Mac Studio was introduced at WWDC 2023, so we are hoping for a new model in October. However, there are suggestions that the wait could be even longer, with a spring or WWDC 2025 launch predicted. More here: M4 Mac Studio rumors Mac Pro with M4 Max and M4 Ultra Like the M2 Mac Studio, the Mac Pro is overdue an update. But this is another Mac that we could be waiting even longer for. Is Apple back to neglecting the creative pro market? We hope not. iPad mini with A17 Apple Apple Apple We could see a new iPad mini launch at the October event. Long neglected by Apple and overdue an update. Apple will surely update the iPad mini to run on an Apple Intelligence supporting chip, perhaps the A17 Pro? Read the latest news about the iPad mini 7th gen. iPad with A17 It’s also time for an update to the standard iPad. This is another iPad that is due an update to the Apple Intelligence-ready A17 chip. Read the latest about the iPad 11th-gen. What did Apple launch at the last October event? In October 2023 Apple launched the M3, M3 Pro, M3 Max processors. Receiving the new processors were the MacBook Pro, which got all three, and the iMac, which gained an M3 chip. The 13-inch MacBook Pro was discontinued in favor of a M3 variant of the 14-inch model. Read about that event here: Everything Apple announced at the ‘Scary Fast’ Mac event. Apple didn’t hold an October event in 2022. In October 2021, Apple launched redesigned models of the high-end MacBook Pro, with a 14-inch and 16-inch models making their debut. Powering the new MacBooks were the high-end M1 Pro and M1 Max chips that built on the already impressive M1 chips that arrived in November 2020. The laptops received new designs with slim bezels and extra ports, including MagSafe, HDMI, and an SD card slot.That event also saw Apple unveil the third-generation AirPods, new HomePod mini colors, and a cheaper, Siri-powered Apple Music subscription, Apple Music Voice.",

    "title": "Every Mac will soon be running the same chip–here’s when the M4 models are coming",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2426453/m4-processor-mac-mini-studio-pro-imac-macbook-air.html",
    "description": "Macworld The next major cycle of Mac upgrades involves the M4 chip and it’s starting soon, according to reports. All of the M4 Macs aren’t being released at the same time, however, and since Apple doesn’t really stick to a set schedule like the iPhone or Apple Watch, it can be confusing to figure out when each Mac is coming and what kind of upgrades will be available. If the rumors are correct, every Mac in Apple’s lineup will get an update within the next 12 months. Here’s a guide for when each model will get the M4 chip, and what else to expect from each upgrade. M4 MacBook Air The MacBook Air will wait until 2025 for its M4 upgrade. The MacBook Air will wait until 2025 for its M4 upgrade.Foundry The MacBook Air will wait until 2025 for its M4 upgrade.Foundry Foundry Release date: The M4 upgrade for the MacBook Air looks like an opportunity for Apple to set a regular release period for the company’s most popular Mac. The M4 MacBook Air is expected to ship in the first quarter of 2025, about a year after Apple released the M3 MacBook Air. The M1 Air was released in November 2020; the M2 Air in July 2022; the 15-inch M2 MacBook Air was released in June 2023. The M4 Air release is a chance to establish a spring cycle for the MacBook Air that Apple could make a regular event. Design: Apple won’t change anything about the MacBook Air design. The current design was introduced in 2022 and it won’t change for several more years. Chip: The 2025 MacBook Air will have a base M4 chip, similar to that used in the iPad Pro. Benchmark results show that the M4 offers a 20 percent improvement over the M3 it will replace. Features: Apple is not expected to upgrade the Liquid Retina display, change the port configuration (MagSafe 3, two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, a 3.5mm audio jack), or upgrade the camera or speakers. Wi-Fi 7 support is possible since the Wi-Fi Alliance made the standard official at the beginning of January. Find out the latest about the M4 MacBook Air. M4 MacBook Pro The MacBook Pro will get its M4 upgrade this fall. The MacBook Pro will get its M4 upgrade this fall.Foundry The MacBook Pro will get its M4 upgrade this fall.Foundry Foundry Release date: The fall timeframe seems to be what Apple has settled on for MacBook Pro releases. Apple will likely release the M4 series of MacBook Pro this fall, with the announcement in October and the ship date on November 1. That would be about a year after Apple released the M3 MacBook Pro lineup. Design: Apple won’t change anything about the MacBook Pro design. The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro design was introduced in 2021. This design will be in place for a few more years. Chip: Apple releases the MacBook Pro with three versions of its M-series chip: A base chip, a Pro chip, and a Max chip. The M4 Pro and M4 Max will be variants of the base M4, implementing more CPU and GPU cores and more unified memory. The M4 chips will offer a 20 percent improvement over the M3 chips they replace. Features: Apple is not expected to upgrade the Liquid Retina XDR display, change the port configuration (MagSafe 3, two or three Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, HDMI, an SDXC Card slot, and a 3.5mm audio jack), or upgrade the camera or speakers. Wi-Fi 7 support is possible since the Wi-Fi Alliance made the standard official at the beginning of January. Find out the latest about the M4 MacBook Pro. M4 iMac The iMac’s M4 upgrade is scheduled for the fall. The iMac’s M4 upgrade is scheduled for the fall.Foundry The iMac’s M4 upgrade is scheduled for the fall.Foundry Foundry Release date: Reports indicate that Apple will release the M4 iMac this fall, with an announcement in October and a ship date of November 1. That would be about a year after Apple released the M3 iMac. The M3 iMac replaced the M1 iMac, which was released in May 2021. Apple could be taking this opportunity to establish a fall release cycle for the iMac. Design: Apple won’t change anything about the iMac design. The current 24-inch iMac design was introduced in May 2021, and it will almost certainly remain in place for a few more years. Chip: The 24-inch iMac features base M-series chips, so the new iMac will have the base M4. Benchmarks have shown that the M4 offers a 20 percent improvement over the M3. Features: Apple is not expected to upgrade the Retina display, change the port configuration (two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports (two additional USB-3 ports, and gigabit ethernet on the mid-and high-end models), and a 3.5mm audio jack), or upgrade the camera or speakers. Wi-Fi 7 support is possible since the Wi-Fi Alliance made the standard official at the beginning of January. Rumors say Apple could release a new iMac with a display as large as 32 inches and a higher-end M4 chip. It’s unlikely that such an iMac is ready for this fall, though Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman recently reported that “it’s unclear if that will be an M4 product or something that comes the following year or later.” Find out the latest about the M4 iMac. M4 Mac mini The M4 Mac mini may have a new, smaller design than the current M2 Mac mini (above). The M4 Mac mini may have a new, smaller design than the current M2 Mac mini (above).Foundry The M4 Mac mini may have a new, smaller design than the current M2 Mac mini (above).Foundry Foundry Release date: Reports indicate that Apple will release the M4 Mac mini this fall, with an announcement in October and a ship date of November. It will replace the M2 Mac mini, which was released in January 2023. And the M1 Mac mini was released in November 2020. Apple could be taking this opportunity to establish a fall release cycle for the Mac mini, but based on the history of the product, the company doesn’t seem to believe that a regular release cycle is necessary for this product. Design: The Mac mini will undergo a drastic change, according to Gurman. It will get even smaller, with a footprint about the size of the Apple TV. This would make the Mac mini more of a competitor to the Raspberry Pi, a small PC that’s often used in special setups. Chip: Apple currently offers the Mac mini with a base or Pro M-series chip, and this will continue with the new design. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the Mac mini with a base M4 chip will ship “immediately,” while the M4 Pro model won’t be available until late October. Features: The smaller design could mean that the Mac mini doesn’t offer some of the ports the current Mac mini offers. Gurman reported that Apple has tested three models that have at least three USB-C ports, a power connector, and an HDMI port. And while Gurman didn’t say so, the USB-C ports are probably also Thunderbolt ports. The current M2 Mac mini has a gigabit ethernet port, USB-A ports, and a 3.5mm audio jack. The latest rumors don’t say whether the alignment will change. While the ethernet and audio jack are likely to stay, It’s possible that Apple will drop the USB-A ports. Wi-Fi 7 support is also possible since the Wi-Fi Alliance made the standard official at the beginning of January. Find out the latest about the M4 Mac mini. M4 Mac Studio The M4 Mac Studio is scheduled for a 2025 release. The M4 Mac Studio is scheduled for a 2025 release.Willis Lai/Foundry The M4 Mac Studio is scheduled for a 2025 release.Willis Lai/Foundry Willis Lai/Foundry Release date: The Mac Studio will not get an upgrade to the M4 until 2025, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The current Mac Studio was released in June 2023 at WWDC, while the first Mac Studio was released in March 2022. So, it appears that the M4 Mac Studio won’t arrive until spring 2025 or at WWDC 2025 in June. Design: The Mac Studio’s design will be only three years old by the time it is updated to the M4, so it won’t change and will maintain its design for several more years. Chip: Apple outfits the Mac Studio with Max and Ultra M-series chips. So, the 2025 Mac Studio will likely have M4 Max or M4 Ultra chips. The current Mac Studio features M2 Max and Ultra chips, so the jump in performance should be impressive. Features: Apple probably won’t change anything about the ports. On the back, the Mac Studio has four Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, two USB-A ports, gigabit ethernet, HDMI, and a 3.5mm audio jack. On the front of the Mac Studio is an SDXC Card slot; the Mac Studio Max has two USB 3 ports, while the Mac Studio Ultra has two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports. Wi-Fi 7 support is possible since the Wi-Fi Alliance made the standard official at the beginning of January. Find out the latest about the M4 Mac Studio. M4 Mac Pro The design of the Mac Pro hasn’t changed since 2019, and it’s not expected to do so. The design of the Mac Pro hasn’t changed since 2019, and it’s not expected to do so.Foundry The design of the Mac Pro hasn’t changed since 2019, and it’s not expected to do so.Foundry Foundry Release date: The Mac Pro will not get an upgrade to the M4 until 2025, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The current Mac Pro was released in June 2023 at WWDC. The M4 Mac Pro won’t arrive until late 2025 or at the earliest, WWDC 2025 in June. Design: Though the design of the Mac Pro is 11 years old, no reports of a redesign have been made. The Mac Pro is made to accommodate internal expansion cards, so if a redesign is in the work, it will keep the tower form factor, which separates it from the Mac Studio. Chip: Apple uses Ultra versions of its M-series chip for the Mac Pro. The current Mac Pro has a M2 Ultra; the upgrade in 2025 will be a M4 Ultra. Features: No reports have been made about the Mac Pro’s features, and, likely, Apple won’t change anything about the slots, ports, or chassis. Wi-Fi 7 support is possible since the Wi-Fi Alliance made the standard official at the beginning of January. Find out the latest about the M4 Mac Pro.",

    "title": "iOS 18 superguide: Everything you need to know about the iPhone update",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-latest-version-release-problems-features-compatibility-beta.html",
    "description": "Macworld Even if you’re not planning to buy one of the new iPhones, your existing iPhone (XR and later) can now get a bunch of new features following the release of iOS 18.  Among the new features in iOS 18 are a redesigned Photos app, new ways to customize your Home screen and wallpaper, new Messages reactions, privacy-related features and dozens of other smaller changes. There will also be some AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence coming to some iPhones (find out if they’ll be on your iPhone below). This free software update brings interface tweaks, bug fixes, and new features. It is like getting a new iPhone without paying a penny. In this article, we discuss everything you need to know about iOS 18, including which iPhones will be able to run iOS 18, the new features – and the new features still to come because they weren’t ready in time for the launch of iOS 18. We’ll also discuss any problems and fixes, the latest update and what’s coming in the next update to iOS 18. We also have information about the beta program including the latest version of the public and developer betas. Update: October 7 – iOS 18.1 coming on October 28, report. iOS 18: Latest version iOS 18.0.1: October 3, 2024 iOS 18: Monday, September 16 iOS 18 arrived on Monday, September 16. macOS Sequoia, watchOS and iPadOS 18 were also launched around the same time. The latest version is iOS 18.0.1. It arrived on October 3, about two and a half weeks after iOS 18 launched. The first update allowed Apple to address some bugs and problems with the initial release, these included: – Touch screen may be temporarily unresponsive in certain circumstances on iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models.– Camera may freeze when recording macro mode video on the Ultra Wide camera in 4K with HDR turned off on iPhone 16 Pro models.– Messages may unexpectedly quit when replying to a message with a shared Apple Watch face.– Performance may be impacted due to an issue with memory allocation on some iPhone models. Apple is also working on a beta of iOS 18.1, which includes Apple Intelligence features. Apple Intelligence is not available in the first version. The first set of features will come in iOS 18 with more following in subsequent updates. See our detailed roadmap of Apple Intelligence features and their likely release dates. Also read: iOS 18 is missing more than just Apple Intelligence iOS 18.1: Release date and new features iOS 18.1 release date: October 28 (predicted) Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman claimed in an October 6 newsletter that iOS 18.1 will arrive on Monday, October 28. iOS 18.1 will bring the first bunch of Apple Intelligence features to iOS 18 – as long as the device is compatible. The following features are available in the initial iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 beta test so we expect them to arrive on compatible iPhones (and compatible iPads) in October: AI writing tools New and improved Siri Mail features like smart replies and email summaries Natural language in photos Call recording and transcription Safari web page summaries Clean Up tool in Photos iOS 18: Problems and bugs Messages bug: A Messages bug that could cause crashes and may even result in the loss of valuable data was reported. It seemed to be connected to an Apple Watch feature that lets users share their watch face over Messages (or Mail). Obviously, those are quite a niche set of circumstances and the best way to avoid it appears to be to not reply to watch faces in a thread. We have more information here: Link-sharing bug in iOS 18 Messages can cause iPhone crashes, data loss. Apple fixed this bug in iOS 18.0.1. Unresponsive touch screen: iPhone 16 Pro owners have complained of display ‘dead spots’, with taps and swipes are being ignored. It is thought that this is related to the Camera Control button. Apple addressed this bug in iOS 18.0.1. Camera freezes in macro mode: This was addressed in iOS 18.0.1. If you have any problems with iOS 18 you may be able to downgrade. Read: How to downgrade an iPhone from iOS 18 to iOS 17. iOS 18: Should I install iOS 18 on my iPhone? As long as your iPhone can run it, we recommend updating to iOS 18. The new features–all of which we discuss below–look enticing enough, and, so far, the only problem (see above) will not affect many people. We address how How iOS 17 and iOS 18 compare separately. Also take a look at: All the little details and hidden features in iOS 18 you won’t want to miss. However, we do recommend you wait a week or more so that any issues with the early release can be addressed: despite the beta program, there are often issues once the software update gets installed on mass-market iPhones. It’s also wise not to be one of the first downloaders because the download will likely take a lot longer if you try soon after it becomes available. iOS 18: How to install Installing iOS 18 and any subsequent updates is a breeze. Just open the Settings app on your iPhone and go to General \u003e Software Update; iOS will check for any available updates and guide you through the process of installing them. You simply have to follow the instructions, which we explain in our iOS updating guide. And it’s easier still if you’ve turned on Automatic Updates, which you can do from the same screen. A little work preparing your iPhone before installing the update can help avoid problems. We advise you follow these steps: Back up your iPhone: Back up before installing the new version and you will always be able to recover your iPhone with the older version of iOS running on it should things go wrong. Read: How to downgrade an iPhone. Make space on your iPhone: If your iPhone doesn’t have a lot of available space internally we recommend having a bit of a tidy-up so you can reclaim some iPhone storage. Simple ways to do this could include deleting apps you don’t use, deleting old Notes, Messages, and duplicated photos. Update your iPhone to the latest version: Don’t skip an update and go straight to iOS 18. If you haven’t installed iOS 17.6.1 yet do so now. iOS 18 compatibility: Which iPhones get iOS 18? The following iPhones get support for iOS 18, the same lineup of supported devices as iOS 17. iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, Pro, Pro Max iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, Pro, Pro Max iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, Pro, Pro Max  iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, Pro, Pro Max  iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, Pro, Pro Max iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, Pro Max  iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max iPhone XR iPhone SE (2nd gen or later) Read: iOS 18 compatibility: Which iPhones support iOS 18 and iOS compatibility checker Some of the new features will not be supported on the older phones, because they lack the hardware necessary (a powerful enough Neural Engine or GPU to run AI stuff, or enough RAM). This is typical of new iOS releases. In 2022, for example, the iPhone 8 and iPhone X missed out on a bunch of cool stuff due to their older processor. It is no surprise, therefore, that the hardware requirements are steep for the AI-related features aka ‘Apple Intelligence’—iPhone 15 Pro or later. Like iOS 17, iOS 18 does not support iPhone 8 or the iPhone X which came out in 2017, but since those phones are able to run iOS 16, they will continue to get support through security updates for at least another year. With the release of iOS 18 though, Apple will stop supporting iOS 15, which will mean that iPhone 7, 7 Plus, iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, and iPhone SE (1st generation) will no longer get support. Generally, Apple has provided software updates for the past two versions of iOS. See: How long does Apple support iPhones. iOS 18: Latest beta iOS 18.1 beta 5 – developer beta released September 23 Apple’s beta testing program for developers and public testers has been running since June/July and continues beyond the launch of iOS 18 to the general public. There is also a separate iOS 18 Sequoia 15.1 beta that includes some as yet unavailable Apple Intelligence features. Initially, this beta was only available for developers, but since the launch of iOS 18 it is now available to public testers, as long as they have supported hardware (iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, and iPhone 16 series). See: Everything Apple Intelligence can (and can’t) do in iOS 18.1. If you want to run the developer beta, you need to be a registered Apple software developer, which has both free and paid ($99/£79) versions. We explain How to join Apple’s beta program separately. Developer betas can be risky though, so we recommend signing up for the Public Beta instead, which should be more stable. Beware though: whether a public beta or a developer beta, any beta software is not as stable as the final version and the iOS and your apps may not work properly. Read Should you install the iOS 18 beta? for advice. Once registered, when you go to Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Update on your Mac, you’ll see a new tab for Beta Updates, which will list the version of the beta you’re running: choose either iOS 18 Developer Beta or iOS 18 Public Beta. If you need help installing the developer or public betas read our How to get the iOS beta article. If you then want to uninstall it, we have a guide for that: How to remove the iOS beta. iOS 18 features still to launch The following promised features aren’t yet in beta: ChatGPT integration Image Playground Genmoji Advanced Siri features like on-screen awareness, personal context, and actions within apps The image features were said to arrive at launch, but more recent reports say it will come later this ye iOS 18 features: The new features in iOS 18 There were many new features in iOS 17 including a new app called Journal, Live Voicemail, and a new way to use Stickers, among dozens of other smaller changes. Rumors suggested that iOS 18 would be “one of the biggest iOS updates — if not the biggest — in the company’s history.” As expected, in iOS 28 Apple will include some major new AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence, although these features will only be available on iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max and newer iPhones. Not all the new features will be available at launch. The first Apple Intelligence AI features will be introduced in iOS 18.1. Other features, such as the new categories in Mail, will come “later this year” in a subsequent software update. Read: These features will be missing when iOS 18 launches this fall. Customization There will be a more customizable Home Screen, Lock Screen, and Control Center in iOS 18. Several reports had claimed that Apple would allow greater personalization of the Home screen, including allowing users to place icons anywhere on the grid, allowing spaces between them. Prior to iOS 18 icons can be reordered or put into folders, but always fill the screen from left to right and top to bottom. In iOS 18 users will be able to arrange apps and widgets anywhere on the Home Screen, including right above the dock or framing a wallpaper. It will even be possible to change the lock screen icons or remove them. In addition, App icons and widgets can have a dark or tinted effect to blend in. Read: iOS 18: How to change the color of the app icons on your home screen and How to put app icons, widgets, and folders anywhere you want as well as iOS 18: How to make your app icons large and label-free. This “put icons wherever you want” feature is something we’ve wanted from Apple for many years, and has been a staple of many Android phones seemingly forever. The Control Centre is getting a redesign to give easier access to a user’s most-utilized controls. Users will also be able to add controls from supported third-party apps into Control Center. Is it enough? Read: Apple is finally letting you have it your way–kinda and You can finally customize your iPhone like Android–here’s everything you can do. Apple Apple Apple Photos New features in Photos will help users find their photos and keep big libraries organized. It’s the biggest redesign of Photos ever and is intended to help users find photos fast. It will be simplified but still familiar, according to Apple and will include a new Unified View, new Collections, and customization features. Users will be able to filter out clutter to narrow down to specific types of content. It will be possible to browse by topics, time, people, memories, trips, Recent Days and People and Pets. A new carousel view will present highlights that update each day – featuring favorite people, pets, and places. Apple Apple Apple Messages Messages will gain new ways to express yourself. Expect improvements to text formatting and fun new text effects. Tapbacks are getting redesigned and will let you tap back with any emoji or sticker. You’ll also be able to amplify and animate letters, word, phrases, and emoji, and add formatting like bold, underline, italics, and strikethrough. You will also be able to schedule a message to send later. Messages will also support RCS for more reliable group messaging with those who do not have an Apple device. Read about how your conversations with Android users will look in iOS 18 and RCS on iPhone with iOS 18: Every question answered. Apple is also making it possible to send Messages via Satellite so you can text when off the grid from Messages app. iMessages sent over satellite are encrypted. Apple Apple Apple Mail Mail will help you manage incoming email better with new on-device categorization. As email arrives it will be sorted into Primary (personal and time-sensitive), Transactions (confirmations and receipts), Updates (news and social notifications), and Promotions (marketing and coupons). A new Digest will pull together all relevant emails from a business, so for example, it could bring all flight information together. The Mail Categorization features will be available later this year. Safari A new Highlights feature is designed to make it easier to discover information on the web. A redesigned Reader experience will use machine learning to surface key information on a webpage so that users can review a summary to get the gist of an article. A table of contents will be included for longer articles Apple says users will also be able to quickly see the location of a restaurant, hotel, or landmark; or listen to an artist’s track right from an article about the song or album. You will also be able to snap away annoying ads. Apple Apple Apple Wallet and Apple Pay There will be new ways to pay with Apple Pay. Users can send and receive Apple Cash by holding two iPhones together: Tap to Cash will let you share cash without exchanging email or number. Tickets in Apple Wallet including key event information like an event guide with info about the venue, and recommended Apple Music playlists Apple Apple Apple iPhone mirroring on the Mac iPhone Mirroring will grant users access to their iPhone via their Mac. It will be possible to see notifications from the iPhone on the Mac, and drag and drop files between the devices. Read: How iPhone Mirroring lets you access your iPhone on your Mac in macOS Sequoia. Other app updates: Journal – New features to help you keep track of goals, Insights view, calendar, writing streak, and actually search Maps – New topographic maps with trails (US national parks only) Game Mode – Will minimize background activity for the best frame rates Notes app – formulas and equations entered while typing will be solved Calendar – incorporates tasks from Reminders and a new monthly view Health app – Medical ID redesigned Emergency SOS Live Video Home app – guest access Accessibility – Eye Tracking iCloud – Apple is adding a “Keep Downloaded” option that prevents the file from being moved to iCloud and keeps the file on the device. Read about the new Keep Downloaded option. Apple didn’t discuss everything at WWDC. There were a number of features that didn’t make the WWDC keynote. Also see: Unannounced iOS 18 tweak lets you see the time even when your iPhone is dead. Privacy features iOS 18 will improve privacy. You will be able to control who can see your apps, which contacts you share with that app, and which accessories apps can connect to. You can also control whether others can view your apps on your iPhone by locking an app so it won’t open without Face ID or a passcode. A new locked hidden apps folder is also coming with iOS 18. Developers will have a way to seamlessly connect third-party accessories with iPhones without letting an app see all the other devices on a user’s network. Apple Apple Apple Apple Intelligence  Apple’s new artificial intelligence system is coming to iPhone, Mac, and iPad with iOS 18, macOS Sequoia, and iPadOS 18. Apple Intelligence will only be supported by iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max though. (Here’s why you’ll need to upgrade your iPhone to get Apple Intelligence, also read: Here’s why newer iPhones and Vision Pro can’t run Apple Intelligence). The hardware requirements are steep—iPhone 15 Pro or later. iPads will need at least an M1 chip or later as will Macs. Apple Intelligence features will mostly be processed on the device, which is different from other platforms where AI processing is done in the cloud. But Apple Intelligence will be able to determine if cloud processing is needed and will use it when appropriate. Apple Intelligence features include the following: Writing – Apple Intelligence will help users enhance their writing and communications. Writing Tools are built in systemwide that will offer to rewrite, proofread, and summarize text in writing focused apps such as Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps. Images – New image capabilities will also come to M-series Macs. In Image Playground users will be able to create images in three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch. Photos – A new Memories in Photos feature will create a video from photos and videos based on a description provided by the user. Apple Intelligence will pick out the photos and videos, develop a storyline based on the photos, and arrange them into a movie. In addition, a new Clean Up tool will identify and remove unwanted objects from the background of a photo. Read: Apple Intelligence FAQ: What it is, what it does, and when you’ll get it and Apple Intelligence is a gradual rollout—here’s what you’ll get, and when. Siri Siri is also getting some AI updates and ChatGPT is to be integrated into Siri. Because some queries will be handled off-device Apple is introducing Private Cloud Compute so that when data is sent to server-based models for processing it is not stored or made accessible to Apple. One of the simplest changes to Siri is that it will be easier to type to Siri rather than having to speak to the on-device assistant. Apple may have finally twigged that people don’t always want to talk to their phones. The new Siri is said to be more “conversational” and natural, with features that “help users in their day-to-day lives.” A new smart responses framework will help Siri take into account your own personal details in its replies: like people, companies, calendar events, locations, dates, and more. Later this year, Siri is said to get cross-device media control. So you can talk to Siri on one of your devices to control media playback on another. In an update scheduled for early 2025, Siri is said to gain the ability to control nearly any app, with hundreds of possible commands. This feature will start off with single commands for Apple’s own apps and grow to include third-party apps and commands with multiple steps. In addition, Siri will be able to react to and take actions based on what is on your screen. This is said to go into beta for developers in January, with a rollout to users in iOS 18.4 in the spring. New accessibility features Apple is planning several new accessibility features for iOS 18, including Adaptive Voice Shortcuts, which will let users turn on or off specific accessibility features using a custom phrase, and Live Speech, which lets users type what they want to say and have it read out loud on phone calls or video meetings, will get the ability to add saved phrases to categories. Features coming after the iOS 18 release Some iOS 18 features won’t be a part of the initial release. Rather, they will be released later in 2024 or in 2025 as part of an iOS 18 point release (iOS 18.2 or iOS 18.4, for example). Here are some of the more significant features we expect to come later in an iOS 18 update: Mail app features – Auto-categorizing of mail, mail digests, and summaries in your inbox are all features expected later in 2024. Home support for robot vacuums – The Home app won’t be able to start or stop your Roomba until later in 2024. Drag and Drop between iPhone and Mac – You’ll be able to see and control your iPhone on your Mac when iOS 18 and macOS 15 are released, but drag-and-drop support between your Mac and iPhone will come in an update. ChatGPT integration – The ability to call upon ChatGPT when using Apple’s AI tools will likely come later in 2024. Advanced Siri features – Siri features like its ability to see and react to what is on your display, semantic indexing (where Siri knows and uses information from across Messages, Mail, Contacts, and more), and advanced control over apps is all coming in 2025. Vehicle Motion Cues in iOS 18 will help reduce motion sickness. Third-party NFC transactions – Apple will allow third-party NFC transactions beginning with iOS 18.1–by request. In addition, all of the Apple Intelligence features will initially support only American English, and may be limited to only some regions. Additional languages and regions are likely to be available through 2025 and beyond.

    "description": "Macworld The iPhone 16 was marketed as being made for Apple Intelligence, but that much-hyped feature wasn’t available when it launched. And it seems disgruntled owners still have a few weeks to wait. In the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman claims that iOS 18.1 is currently slated for a public roll-out on Monday, October 28. That might not sound terrifically exciting, x.1 point updates generally being less momentous than the x.0 releases that land each September, but this one is important because it heralds the arrival of Apple Intelligence. Gurman explains that the rollout is happening later than originally expected because Apple wants to play it safe following a number of recent software problems: the iPadOS 18 bug, for instance, that bricked some iPad Pros. “I’m told that Apple is taking its time with the rollout,” he writes, “to ensure that major bugs are eliminated and it can support all the new traffic on its AI cloud servers.” Understandable, but likely to cause more frustration for those who spent big on new iPhones this fall and were looking forward to trying out Apple’s belated entry into the AI space. What’s more, Apple Intelligence is scheduled for a gradual rollout across a span of months, with many features not slated to appear for several more months. And that’s before we even get to the tinkering and tweaking that’s likely to be necessary before Apple Intelligence reaches the same level of reliability and usefulness as rival AI platforms that have been on the market for a while–a process that could run into years. Still, as the old tech saying goes: better late than crippled with bugs that will drive users to rival platforms. Apple Intelligence will be here eventually, and we hope it’ll be worth the wait.",

    "description": "Macworld The second Amazon Prime Day of 2024 is this week. The ‘Prime Big Deal Days’ sale runs from October 8-9 and we’ll be updating the content below, so stay tuned for the best Amazon Prime Day iPhone deals! If you’re looking for a new iPhone you may be wondering if the iPhone is on sale for Prime Day. The answer to this question depends on where you are based. If you’re in the U.S., Amazon is not the place to go to buy a new iPhone, however, in other countries, including the U.K., you will find the latest iPhones at Amazon at lower prices than Apple sells them for. iPhone deals are available year-round, but it isn’t usually until Prime Day that the deals are better at Amazon than from carriers and other retailers. In the U.K., you can find the latest iPhones unlocked at Amazon and at other resellers. Supplies can be limited, and there are usually only small discounts for the newest handsets, but you might see some good deals on the older iPhone models such as the iPhone 14, iPhone 13, and iPhone SE. You can see current deals on various iPhones below. If you aren’t sure which iPhone to buy take a look at our iPhone buying guide and our comparison of every iPhone handset. If you are in the U.S. there are still deals on Apple products to be had, and plenty of savings on iPhone accessories. So read on to find out how much you can save. The iPhone models and accessories here are all chosen by our editors, who have decades of experience with Apple devices.

The products below are all at or near all-time lows, and we’ve selected what we think is the best configuration for each product type. We know Apple is expensive, so we’ve chosen products at prices we would be willing to pay, so you can trust that our recommendations will steer you in the right direction—and save you big bucks. Best iPhone deals of Amazon Prime Day If you’re in the U.K. the iPhone is likely to be on sale for Prime Day. The new iPhone 16 hasn’t been here long so don’t expect big discounts on those iPhones, but we may see cut-price iPhone 15 and older models. Just check that Amazon displays the current Apple price for the older iPhones as Apple recently dropped the prices on these models. These are the best iPhone deals we are seeing right now: iPhone 15 (128GB): £681 (£18 off, RRP now £699 ) iPhone 15 Plus (128GB): £799 (RRP now £799) iPhone 15 Pro (128GB): £899 (£100 off; RRP was £999 DISCONTINUED) iPhone 15 Pro Max (256GB): £1,099 (£100 off; RRP was £1,199 DISCONTINUED) iPhone 14 Plus (128 GB): £699 (RRP now £699) iPhone 14 Pro (256GB): £999 (RRP was £1,209 DISCONTINUED) iPhone 13 (128GB): £499 (RRP was £599 DISCONTINUED) For all the best Prime Day deals on Apple products see our round-up of the Best Prime Day Apple Deals.

Here are the best sales we’re tracking.

Many items in the Amazon Prime Day Sale are only open to Prime members, so you’ll need to sign in with an active membership to purchase one of the deals. Prime memberships cost $139 / £95 / AUD$59 annually, or $14.99 / £8.99 / AUD$6.99 every month. New users can sign up for a 30-day free trial that can be canceled at any time during the trial window. You’ll also get free one or two-day delivery and access to Amazon Prime Video and all that content. One tip when you click on a good deal—even if it’s from a Macworld page—is to check that the product isn’t redirected to a refurbished model, and the current manufacturer’s price is listed, as that can make the price drop look a lot better than it is. In order to take advantage of some Prime Day deals, you need to be an Amazon Prime member. Amazon Prime costs $14.99 / £8.99 / AUD$6.99 on a monthly basis (but can be canceled after 30 days) and gives you two-day free delivery and access to Prime Video. Prime Day 2024: Our favorite deals We’ve been tracking iPhone deals for years and know a good one when we see it. Throughout the Prime Day sale, we constantly check Amazon’s listings to find the best deals. We’ve tested all of the models we recommend here and only select the very best deals for publication—so if you see an iPhone listed here, you’ll know it’s at or near its all-time low price.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2479536/apple-is-reportedly-moving-away-from-annual-launches.html",
    "description": "Macworld If there’s one thing we can usually set our Apple Watches to, it’s Apple’s schedule of releases. There’s a spring event with Macs, WWDC in June with all of the OS previews, September is for iPhones and Apple Watches, and October is dedicated to Macs and iPads. Apple occasionally deviates from that routine, but for the most part, that’s the annual schedule. If you’re buying something, you can plan ahead. But according to Mark Gurman, writing in his latest Power On newsletter, Apple isn’t interested in continuing that cycle. In a detailed report that examines Apple’s strategy and the problems it has caused, including the delay of Apple Intelligence and other key products, Gurman points to the Apple Watch Ultra 2’s new color as a sign that Apple is shifting away from updating products to fit a timeline and instead saving features “to make a bigger splash.” Notably, Gurman suggests that Apple may “abandon the mad scramble to get OS features ready for release in September” and switch to a “staggered” approach beginning next year. He implies that Apple may even consider moving the iPhone launch to a different month to “help tie the hardware launches together with those new software features.” Apple launched the iPhone 16 last month without Apple Intelligence, one of its main features. Gurman’s report suggests that the staggered rollout is at least partially responsible for the shift in strategy. The first Apple Intelligence features are expected to arrive on October 28, more than a month after the iPhone 16 hit shelves. It should, however, ship with the first round of M4 Macs, which are due to arrive in October. It’s not clear whether the shift in announcing iOS features would change the date of WWDC or the keynote content. Apple could still announce iOS and macOS at the June event but maybe hold back features or give a clearer roadmap for when they will arrive.",

    "description": "Macworld Wondering if AirPods will be on sale for Amazon’s October Prime Big Deal Days? Whether you’re buying your first pair of AirPods or upgrading the trusty ‘buds you have used every day for years, Amazon’s twice-yearly Prime Day sales are a great time to look for a discount. Many Apple products are rarely on sale, and when they do go on sale they’re barely at a discount at all. AirPods are an exception: As long as they’re not a just-released model, they’re almost always available at a discount from the official retail price. And when big sales events come around, like Prime Day or Black Friday, you can often save 25 percent or more. Amazon is one of the best places to look for AirPods deals, and we are already seeing some excellent discounts during the Prime Day event which runs from October 8 to midnight on October 9. We’ll keep this article updated throughout Prime Day so you can quickly find the best deal. The AirPods picked here are all chosen by our editors, who have decades of experience with Apple devices. We’ve reviewed everything we recommend and we won’t tell you to buy something that’s not an actual deal.

Amazon Prime Day 2024: Best AirPods deals With Apple revamping the AirPods range in September 2024–with the introduction of the AirPods 4 and new colors and USB-C for the AirPods Max–we can expect to see some discounts on the older, now discontinued, models over Prime Day. U.S. AirPods Prime Day deals In the U.S. we are already seeing discounts on the new AirPods 4 at Amazon. There are also some price cuts on the older AirPods AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C case): $190 ($59 off, MSRP $249) AirPods 4: $119 ($10 off, MSRP $129) AirPods 4 with ANC: $179 (No discount, MSRP $179) AirPods Max (USB-C): $535 ($14 off, MSRP $549) AirPods (3rd gen, wired case): $130 ($39 off, MSRP was $169 DISCONTINUED) AirPods Max (Lightning): $399 ($150 off, MSRP was $549 DISCONTINUED) U.K. AirPods Prime Day deals While Amazon is yet to discount the new AirPods in the U.K. there are discounts on the older models that have been discontinued, as well as the AirPods Pro. We think that prices may drop even more before Prime Day 2 is over.

Here at Macworld, we know more than most about Apple’s range of products, and we can spot a bargain too, having compiled regular Apple deals roundups for years. We’re not likely to be fooled by the usual tricks, such as prices being raised just before a sales event so the discounts look bigger. We’ll make sure to steer you to the genuinely worthwhile deals. Apple’s only recently updated the Apple Watch, with the 10th generation model replacing the Apple Watch Series 9. As a result, you can expect to see some decent deals on the older model. And because Apple didn’t update the Apple Watch Ultra or the Apple Watch SE this time round we expect to see money off those models too. The Apple Watch models picked here are all chosen by our editors, who have decades of experience with Apple devices. We’ve reviewed everything we recommend and we won’t tell you to buy something that’s not an actual deal.

    "description": "Macworld The first thing you should do after buying a new iPhone 16, be it an iPhone 16 Plus, Pro or Max, is to admire it and then swiftly cover it up. Buy yourself an iPhone 16 case to protect your precious mobile after splashing a ton of cash on it, and add some style to make your new handset more personal. Best clear iPhone 16 cases Best-looking iPhone 16 cases Best protective cases for iPhone 16 Best leather and leather-alternative iPhone 16 cases Best iPhone 16 cases with lanyards Best phone slings iPhone 16 case: Protection The most common causes for accidental smartphone damage are: dropping your phone on the ground, it falling from a pocket or bag, or it being knocked off a table. The main results of such phone accidents are cracked and scratched screens, followed by chipped corners and sides. In fact, research shows that within 10 weeks of purchase, half of all new phone users will drop their handset. D’oh! Even a basic phone case will offer some protection against such everyday drops and knocks, and some are built to withstand more catastrophic accidents. A few years ago, such ultra-protective cases meant you’d be carrying around something the size and weight of a brick, but modern materials mean that protective cases can be relatively slim and light. Clever design and tough-but-thin materials such as Kevlar and Graphene are key to the levels of robustness—but it remains the case that the bulkier the case, the more protection it will offer as long as it is also clever and made of the right stuff. Let’s face it the iPhone is basically made front and back of glass—even if it is a new version of Ceramic Shield that Apple claims is “two times tougher than any smartphone glass”—and glass dropped on the floor usually ends in despair. Look for raised edges (known as a bezel) around the screen that will protect it from drop cracks and scratches. Another point of obvious weakness is the camera lens area, and you should go for a case with a raised edge around that part, too. Where we have the exact dimensions, we have included this information in our case reviews below. Look for button covers—in metal or plastic. Some cases prefer cutouts but may offer less protection as a result. The iPhone 16’s new Camera Control on the right side of all the iPhone 16 models may take third-party case makers time to catch up as most won’t have seen the latest iPhone before Apple announced it to the world. This “button” is capacitive so it can’t be covered using standard materials in the same way as the other iPhone buttons can. In its own cases, Apple (and Apple-owned Beats) utilizes a piece of sapphire crystal coupled with a conductive layer to communicate finger movements—including taps, slides and swipes—to the button below. That means it retains all its functionality, including the half-press and swipes. At launch, only the OtterBox Lumen iPhone 16 cases, reviewed below, feature the same Camera Control covering. This case is the only third-party case on sale in the Apple Store so it’s likely that OtterBox was briefed earlier than other case makers. However, we’d expect some of the cases reviewed below to replace Camera Control cutouts with similar coverings in the weeks and months ahead as they play catch up. A similar thing happened with the new Action button on the iPhone 15, and third-party cases changed their cutouts for buttons quite quickly. iPhone 16 case: Style Apple makes the iPhone a thing of sleek beauty and offers a small range of colors (exciting for the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, but rather dull for the Pro and Pro Max). If you want to keep this Apple elegance while still protecting the phone, choose a clear case that won’t detract from the Apple designers’ art. If you want to add more personality—if only to distinguish your iPhone from those of your family, friends or colleagues—there are hundreds of designs to choose from. Some are quite beautiful, some fine art, and some I wouldn’t want to be seen with in a dark room. And iPhone 16 cases come in many forms: wallet cases, cases that support bike and car mounts, phone pouches, sleeves, slings and cases with belt-clips. Here we keep adding the best we can find as they come in for testing. iPhone 16 case: Fit Ensure you choose the right case for your exact model so that it fits correctly over the buttons and camera lenses for uninterrupted use. Where possible we have linked to the buying pages for each model: iPhone 16 (6.1 inch), iPhone 16 Plus (6.7 inch), iPhone 16 Pro (6.3 inch) and iPhone 16 Pro Max (6.9 inch). Don’t think you can squeeze your new 16 model iPhone into a case for an older model. Sometimes a new iPhone is the same size as the previous model, but not the 16 unfortunately. Upgraders need a new case. iPhone 16 case: magnetic wireless charging Also make sure that the case is MagSafe compatible so that you can charge wirelessly with a MagSafe charger while your iPhone 16 stays in its case. So-called “clear” cases sadly require a huge white ring on their back to be compatible with MagSafe charging. Colored, patterned or leather cases hide their magnets better. You can, of course, still charge via a USB-C cable—which will always be the fastest way to charge an iPhone—and an iPhone charger. Best clear iPhone cases for iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max If covering up Apple’s iPhone offends your inner Jony Ive, look for a clear, transparent case that keeps the iPhone’s looks as wonderful as they were straight out of the box. 1. Apple iPhone 16 Clear Case with MagSafe – Best clear iPhone 16 case Pros Made by Apple Shows off iPhone’s color Cons Basic protection Expensive Price When Reviewed: $49 Best Prices Today: $39.99 at Amazon$49 at Apple$49 at Apple United States MagSafe compatible: Yes Weight: 29g Camera edge: 2mm Button covers: Plastic Action button: Covered Camera Control: Covered Colors: Clear Available for: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max This simple, rigid iPhone 16 protective case from Apple is thin and light, and by design, it doesn’t disguise the color of your iPhone 16 that you chose when you purchased it. Why pick out a Pink or Desert Titanium iPhone 16 Pro Max, only to cover it up in a black plastic case or something with badly drawn flowers on it? With Apple’s Clear case, you get decent protection without ruining the look of the phone.(If you want a black case or flowery pattern instead of Apple’s small palette of colors, we have plenty for you to choose from lower down this feature. The Apple Clear Case is made from a blend of optically clear polycarbonate and other flexible materials, with a scratch-resistant coating on both the inside and outside. While it’s more protective than silicone cases and features a robust-looking 2mm camera lip, you can find tougher cases, which we have reviewed below. There is one part of the case that isn’t clear—the white MagSafe ring on the back. As with all the Apple cases, the Camera Control is covered with a capacitive button that allows for finger taps and gestures without compromising on protection. The bottom of the case is a large cutout, however, leaving the USB-C port, speakers and microphone exposed. At 29g it’s super light, and while the rigid case adds a little bulk, it’s worth a little compromise for that layer of protection. All materials and coatings are optimized to prevent yellowing over time. There are also cheaper clear cases, which we have also tested for you. But the Apple badge is a sure sign of quality, as you’d expect. The colors on the new iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models aren’t as exciting as the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, though, so we wouldn’t blame you for deciding on something more joyful. 2. ESR Zero Clear Case for iPhone 16 – Best budget clear iPhone 16 case Pros Shows off iPhone’s color Flexible Affordable Cons Basic protection Price When Reviewed: $15.99 Best Prices Today: $9.99 at Amazon$15.99 at ESR MagSafe compatible: Yes Weight: 27g Raised edge: 1mm Camera edge: 0.7mm Button covers: Plastic Action button: Covered Camera Control: Cutout Colors: Clear Available for: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max If you want basic protection for your new iPhone 16, the clear ESR Zero Clear Case has a 1.2mm front edge to protect the screen and a smaller-than-most 0.7mm camera guard. It’s made from a crystal-clear polymer, which ESR claims resists yellowing for longer than cheaper cases. It is wireless compatible so you don’t need to flip the case off to charge wirelessly. ESR also makes other less flexible but tougher clear cases, such as the iPhone 16 Air Armor Clear Case with better drop protection and AirGuard corners. The iPhone 16 Pro Classic Hybrid Case has a tough scratch-resistant acrylic back and is available in a Shimmer effect that adds a little more excitement and personality to your average clear case. The iPhone 16 Classic Hybrid Case with Stash Stand, which features military-grade protection and a handy built-in kickstand for stable viewing, is reviewed below. These clear alternatives add a little more weight and cost but are recommended for their extra protection and features. 3. Totallee Super Thin Case for iPhone 16 – Slimmest, lightest hard clear iPhone 16 case Pros Slimmest clear case Lightest case Cons Basic protection MagSafe costs more Price When Reviewed: From $35 Best Prices Today: $35 at Amazon$35 at Totallee MagSafe compatible: Optional Weight: 8g Button covers: Covered Action button: Covered Camera Control: Cutout Colors: Clear, Frosted Clear, Frosted Black, Frosted Red, Frosted Green, Frosted Navy Blue Available for: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max This is the slimmest (0.5mm) iPhone 16 case we have tested and—by a long way—the lightest at just 8g. Totalee claims the case weighs 0.2oz, which is 3g but our scales weighed it at 8g, which could just be a failing of our scales. In either case, even 8g is barely noticeable. Even at this weight, there are button covers, and a cutout for the Camera Control. There is a clear version and a similar Frosted Clear model, plus a bunch of other frosted colors to choose from. Note that you have to pay a little more for the MagSafe-compatible versions, which no doubt add a little weight and thickness in parts. 4.

Make sure you choose your exact model. It is transparent, aside from the required giant MagSafe icon, and more affordable than the Apple clear case. The kickstand—otherwise hidden in the camera ring—is an added bonus, working in both landscape and portrait modes. The metal stand is an extra camera guard when not in use. ESR even suggests you can use it to carry your iPhone on your finger when your hands are full. If so, you’ll be interested in the protection it offers if it slides off your finger… There’s the usual tough talk of military-grade protection, with the case featuring shock-absorbing AirGuard corners and a 0.7mm camera lip. At 40g, it’s one of the heavier clear cases, which is caused by the handy metal kickstand. 5. Casetify clear Impact and Bounce Cases for iPhone 16 – Most customizable clear iPhone 16 case Pros Shows off iPhone’s true color Protection level options Built-in kickstand option Cons Not entirely transparent Price When Reviewed: From $72 Best Prices Today: $72 at Casetify MagSafe compatible: Yes Weight: 45g Raised edge: 1.4mm Camera edge: 2mm Button covers: Plastic Action button: Covered Camera Control: Cutout Colors: Clear Available for: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max One of our favorite clear options is Casetify’s Impact and Bounce cases, which are both available for all models of the iPhone 16 family. Casetify offers these cases in a selection of protection levels and handily shows you what each case will look like depending on the color of your iPhone. It is solidly built and feels robust, offering a minimum of 6.6ft (2m) drop protection up to 32.8ft (10m) if you choose the Ultra Bounce Case. For a little extra outlay, the Impact Case can be ordered with an integrated stand, otherwise hidden in the camera ring. The case edges aren’t clear because they feature extra-protective EcoShock or TesseLock designs. On one side there are sockets to easily attach phone charms. Casetify Casetify Casetify The Bounce Case boasts 21.3ft (6.5m) drop protection, while the Ultra Bounce promises an incredible 23.8ft (10m). The more protection, sadly the less of the original phone can be seen even in a clear case, but most of the shock absorption on the Bounce case family protrudes from the corners. 6. Rokform Crystal Case iPhone 16 – Most protective clear iPhone 16 case Pros Shows off iPhone’s color (mostly) Robust protection Cons Not entirely transparent Not MagSafe compatible Heavy Price When Reviewed: $69.99 Best Prices Today: $69.99 at Amazon£69.99 at Rokform MagSafe compatible: No Weight: 75g Raised edge: 2mm Camera edge: 1mm Button covers: Plastic Action button: Covered Camera Control: Cutout Colors: Clear with black trim Available for: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max For those who want to see and show off their iPhone’s original coloring, but still gain maximum protection, Rokform offers its Crystal Case for the iPhone 16 family. This is more solid looking than even the Casetify Ultra Bounce reviewed above. As you’d expect, that protection comes at the price of some bulk and heft. It’s not fully clear because its black sides, edges and corners are made from a military-grade polycarbonate and TPU combination to absorb shocks from drops and falls. At present, the Rokform cases are too thick to work with all MagSafe chargers so you will likely need to remove your phone from the case to charge it wirelessly. The company is planning a thinner version, and we’d recommend waiting for that MagSafe-compatible version if you want accessible wireless charging. The case also features the Rokform’s famous twist-lock and magnetic mounting system for bike, motorcycle and car mounts. If you’re going biking with iPhone on your handlebars, a super-protective case is a must. Rokform does ship internationally, but you’ll need to check the fees depending on your region, and remember that customs charges also vary by country. 7.

While it looks almost invisible—except for the necessary white MagSafe area— this case, made from recycled polycarbonate and TPU, still offers 8-foot drop protection with corner air pockets. The sides and buttons feature a frosted texture for enhanced grip. Also included is a handy dedicated lanyard loop. The straight clear Incase Slim Case for MagSafe is joined by shaded models in four subtle colorways. Best-looking iPhone cases for iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max While some will prefer a clear case to keep their iPhone’s natural color, others are easily bored and want a splash of difference, from plain new colors, through pretty or cool patterns, to fully customizable designs. We’ve counted hundreds of designs on offer, so there must be something here for you and your iPhone 16. 1. Apple iPhone 16 Silicone Case with MagSafe – Popular, Apple-branded colorful case range Pros Made by Apple Wide vibrant color range Cons Not as protective as others Expensive Price When Reviewed: $49 Best Prices Today: $39.99 at Amazon$41.99 at Best Buy$41.99 at Walmart Electronics MagSafe compatible: Yes Weight: 30g Button covers: Silicone Action button: Covered Camera Control: Covered Colors: Star Fruit, Ultramarine, Lake Green, Fuchsia, Stone Gray, Plum, Black, Denim Apple: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max Amazon: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max The smooth Apple Silicone case is a classic, popular protective iPhone covering—available in the widest range of colors with eight to choose from. There’s enough choice here to satisfy most people, but if you prefer to see the color of the iPhone itself, look to a clear case; see above. Apple pretty much threw out all its lovely Silicone colors from the iPhone 15 (Guava, Orange Sorbet, Winter Blue, Black, Storm Blue, Clay. Light Pink, Cypress, Sunshine, Pink, Soft Mint, Light Blue) and dreamt up a whole new bunch, many of which are poppy and vibrant. It is as protective as you need for everyday calamities except big falls—if you want ultra protection, look to our best protective cases reviewed further down. If you are prone to letting your phone slip out of your hand, look for cases made from TPU, Kevlar or Graphene. It is made with a soft-touch, almost silky 55% recycled silicone material. Inside, the lining is soft microfiber to protect the iPhone itself from scratches. Apple has added a silicone button to the Action button but left the new Camera Control button covered up with a conductive layer to communicate finger movements to the control—at the time of writing, only the OtterBox iPhone 16 case has anything similar with most other cases using a simple cutout for the Camera Control. Apple has somehow engineered a little screen animation when you place the iPhone inside the Silicone Case, which is a nice—if otherwise not very useful—touch. Aside from the colors and the attention to detail, people flock to this Apple case apart because it’s made by Apple and has the famous logo on the back. You can’t go wrong buying an Apple-made case, but you can find more options elsewhere. 2.

To add some fun you need a non-clear case, and if you want to impose your own personality then look for customization options. The most customizable range of iPhone 16 cases we’ve seen are from Casetify, where you can mix and match colors, patterns, prints, artists, and personalization options, as well as several levels of protection. Prices vary and rise depending on the protection levels, but for most you get a wide range of design options. The level of choice is almost overwhelming, and you’ll have fun choosing the case that looks just right for you. You can add a name or short word, plus add hearts and stars, fonts, and text colors if you desire. Some cases feature a pull-out stand, which is otherwise hidden in the camera ring. Casetify also offers a range of protection levels: Impact (8.2ft drop protection, 4x MIL-STD-810G or 6.6ft and 3x with a ring stand), Bounce (21.3ft drop protection, 6x MIL-STD-810G), Ultra Bounce (Bounce corners, 32.8 ft. drop protection, 10x MIL-STD-810G) and, for the 16 Pro and Pro Max, Ultra (Ultra Bounce corners, 32.8 ft. drop protection, 10x MIL-STD-810G, 6-layered rugged protection). The raised bezel to protect the screen can be either 1.4mm or 1.6mm, and the protective camera ring from 2mm to 3.8mm. The Impact Ring case features the tallest camera-protecting lip at 3.6mm, the biggest we’ve seen in our tests. You’ll find all the customization options direct from Casetify—see the links above. 3.

You could well end up buying more than one! Aside from the 95+ designs, you can choose between the Classic and Bold case models for each type of iPhone 16. The Classic Collection is lighter and more flexible with a glossy finish, while the Bold Collection is more protective and comes with a matte finish. The Bold models have ribbed sides, which adds real grip, making it less likely that you’ll drop your iPhone in the first place—but if you do there’s impressive 8-foot drop protection and a 3mm raised screen lip (only 1mm on the Classic), the highest we’ve tested. The camera edge could be a little higher, but we are big fans nonetheless. Casely adds small shipping fees if bought direct—these are calculated at final checkout. Uniquely Casely offers club membership where subscribers receive a new phone case every month, with exclusive members-only styles released each month. Users choose a style or Casely can send a surprise case. 4.

The standard Silicone Core range has the widest selection of colors, but the Silicone Stacks models include an attractive raised effect on the back that set them apart from other silicone cases. There’s a range of vibrant and cool colors. The Silicone Stacks model is available in the exquisitely named Tangerine Orange, Bubblegum Pink, Mist Green, Phantom Black, Stone Gray and Super Sonic Blue. The standard Silicone Core is in Air Blue, Blue Print, Jade Green, Lilac Purple, Popcorn Yellow, Phantom Black, Sandstone Pink and Stone Gray. On top of the color and back-effect choices the cases boast metal buttons and a lovely silky soft touch that will have you stroking the case like the seats of a new car. Drop resistance up to 1.2 meters is claimed, although we’d have preferred a little more screen and camera edge height. 5.

We think this adds a certain gravity to the phone’s looks. Protection level is high without making the case too bulky and the reinforced AiroShock impact-absorbing corner bumps are reasonably subtle. It has rippled grip ribs and side eyelets for wrist straps and phone slings. There is also a range of Mous mounts for bikes, cars and motorbikes that work with the company’s Interlock Case. The screen and camera edge height is a little lower than on most cases. 7. Wave Case for iPhone 16 – Best Sustainable iPhone 16 Eco Case Pros Biodegradable and plastic-free Color options Cons Not all models are MagSafe compatible Price When Reviewed: From $34 Best Prices Today: $34 at Wave MagSafe compatible: Yes (where stated) Weight: 40g (16 Pro) Raised edge: 2mm Camera edge: 2mm Button covers: Recycled materials Action button: Covered Camera Control: Cutout Colors: Black, Yellow, Turquoise, Pink, Khaki, Red, Blue, White Available for: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max With the Wave range of biodegradable iPhone cases, you can protect your phone and the planet, reducing your plastic consumption. The plant-based phone cases are made from two commonly used biodegradable polymers. Known for its rigid and transparent properties PLA (Polylactic Acid) is derived from renewable resources such as wheat straw. PBAT (Polybutylene Adipate Terephthalate) is a biodegradable copolyester that offers flexibility and durability. Together they make an eco-friendly material that works well for phone protection. You can also add a recycled glass screen protector. Despite being plastic-free the smooth but grippy Wave cases have “been “military grade” (MIL-STD 810) drop protection, shock-absorbing corners and feature a generous protective 2mm lip around the screen and camera—one of the tallest we have seen. Not all sustainable products are boring—the Wave cases come in a wide range of bright colors and printed designs. The case material adds a natural fleck to the design. The standard and Etched case designs aren’t MagSafe compatible but will charge wirelessly. However, you can pay a little more for an integrated magnet that makes the case MagSafe compatible, which we would recommend. 8.

It has one of the widest ranges of iPhone 16 case models, and is favored by Apple as one of the few case manufacturers it allows to sell on its store. Here we highlight the Lumen and Figura case designs. The Lumen Case for iPhone 16 is sleek and minimalist with a clear, scratch-resistant case with fun pops of color, and textured side grips, as well as raised edges protect camera and screen. Like the Apple cases it keeps the Camera Control covered, with a conductive layer to communicate finger movements.The super-slim Figura Case features psychedelic patterns that are hydro-dipped by hand. The graphics envelop the case from edge to edge. The material is flexible with a soft touch. 10.

Now it’s owned by Apple and still makes some cool headphones, but its cases seem rather superfluous, offering little more than a glossy hardshell alternative to Apple’s much more fun but less protective Silicone iPhone 16 cases. It feels more like a colored version of the Apple Clear Case. They do boast much more interesting bold interior accent colors, but these would have been better on the outside surely. One benefit of being an Apple brand is that the Beats iPhone 16 cases also feature the sapphire crystal conductive layer that covers the Camera Control. 11. Atom Studios Soft Snap for iPhone 16 – Thinnest iPhone 16 case Pros No-bulk minimalism Sustainably conscious materials Cons No screen protection Price When Reviewed: From $39.99 Best Prices Today: $39.99 at Atom Studios MagSafe compatible: Yes Weight: 50g (Wood Fiber), 41g (Silicone) Button covers: n/a Action button: n/a Camera Control: n/a Colors: Space Grey, Ink Blue, Stone Beige and Carbon Black Available for: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max The Soft Snap is not a “case” in the same form as most of the protectors reviewed here. It’s more of a protective back plate. It maintains the thinness of the iPhone 16 by adding only protection and color to the phone’s back and camera lenses. The case pops on and off with a snap, as the name suggests, and its lack of bulk means it will slip into and out of your pocket with ease. While its lightweight minimalism will appeal to the slim and thin iPhone enthusiasts, it’s not for the cautious. There is no raised—or indeed any—front lip or side protection but the case is compatible with separate screen protectors. Soft Snap is made from 100% recycled post-consumer plastic with a soft touch coating, with an interior that is lined with recycled plush microfiber. Atom Studios also offers a more traditional but still eco-friendly iPhone 16 case: the dual-material Split Wood Fiber Case that is part aluminum and part eucalyptus oil-infused wood fiber. This case does offer solid 10-foot drop protection, with a 1mm raised edge—lower than on some cases but enough to save a screen from a small fall. The Camera Control is a cutout. Atom Atom Atom 12. Clicks for iPhone 16 – Add a BlackBerry-like keyboard Pros Adds a physical 36-key keyboard Access to iOS Shortcuts Frees up screen space Strong colors Cons Adds length to the iPhone Price When Reviewed: From $139 Best Prices Today: $139 at Clicks MagSafe compatible: Yes Weight: 70g (Pro); 80g (Pro Max) Button covers: Plastic Action button: Covered Camera Control: Cutout Colors: Surf (blue), Onyx (black), Spice (ochre) Available for: iPhone 16 all models It seems an abomination to make the iPhone act and even look like a BlackBerry but there are people out there who want to have a physical keyboard attached to their iPhone. Actually, it’s not as mad as it sounds. Not using the screen keyboard can give you back nearly half your usable screen, and it allows navigation within and between apps with fewer swipes and taps by turning each of its 36 keys into customizable action buttons for over 100 shortcuts, leveraging iOS’s native Shortcuts app and accessibility settings. Using the Clicks Keyboard app users can personalize their keyboard experience with features such as brightness levels, dim timeouts, battery optimization options, alt lock, and caps lock. You can even create an Android-like Back button. Additionally, the shortcuts can unlock advanced automations such as calling Uber, emailing meeting updates, and controlling smart home devices. The Clicks version for iPhone 16 lacks some of the iPhone 15 Clicks crazy colors, but the new ochre color is still quite out there. The new iPhone 16 version features a refined keyboard with new contoured ergonomically designed keys that offer an elevated typing experience, plus brushed metal side keys, a microfiber lining and a new enclosure. The latest version now works with Apple’s MagSafe magnetic wireless charging, which was absent on the previous version. Clicks for iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be available to order beginning October 7. Clicks for iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models will be available later this year. The Clicks for iPhone 16 Pro Case is 19.1cm long (compared to the phone’s 14.7cm length) and weighs 70g; for iPhone Pro Max, 20.7cm (16cm iPhone) and 80g. Best protective iPhone cases for iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max A case isn’t there just to make your iPhone look pretty. The best cases offer reasonable protection while adding as little bulk as possible by using the latest, strongest materials. Kevlar is the material used to make bulletproof vests—it’s also known as Aramid Fiber. Graphene is even stronger. Zagg claims the graphene used in its Denali Snap case is “harder than a diamond, yet more elastic than rubber, and up to 200x stronger than steel”. That suggests a fall onto the pavement—or indeed off a cliff—might not be fatal for your phone. Some protective iPhone cases go full out and don’t care about their bulk as long as they protect your iPhone from the biggest disasters that can befall it. We’ve tested protective iPhone 16 cases from the thin to the very thick. 1.

This is down to its Graphene-infused back plate. Graphene is the strongest material known to man—supposedly up to 200x stronger than steel. The case’s border features TPU. The camera lip isn’t as high as on some cases but it should protect the lenses when the phone is placed or dropped down flat. Its rugged, textured finish adds a good grip, and when it’s not in your hand there’s an integrated metal kickstand that works in both landscape and portrait modes. It is constructed with up to 89% post-consumer recycled materials. Zagg has a wide range of iPhone 16 cases, and its SoHo Snap, in a range of two-tone colors depending on which country you are shopping from. U.S. customers have the widest choice including a fetching Currant color, although only U.K. buyers can get their hands on the light blue version. It gains protection points as it also features a graphene-infused backplate with 10ft (3m) drop protection. 2.

It’s a woven fiber, giving it a slightly textured grippy feel, to keep the iPhone from falling out of your hand in the first place. With some cases that sometimes leads to a struggle to pull it quickly from a pocket but we didn’t find this to be a problem with the Benks Kevlar cases. The metal frame on the back gives raised protection around the camera lenses—one of the best we’ve seen. The buttons on the sides are nicely solid in the TPU frame that offers superior shock resistance. It weighs 39g, which is light for a case offering such protection. Benks also sells a lighter ArmorAir model that has exposed buttons and no TPU frame. Both have a cutout for the Camera Control. The ArmorPro can withstand a 6-foot drop; the ArmorAir just 4ft. Both are MagSafe compatible, and priced the same—although there are slight price differences with the back pattern options. 3.

Plus, Pro and Pro Max. It looks the part, quite solid and slab-like but more flexible on the sides than the Rokform Rugged Case, see above. The integrated metal kickstand pulls out from the camera ring. It is constructed with a three-layer design (TPU soft shell, TPE hard shell, and shock-absorbing Poron lining) that ESR claims can withstand drops from as high as 23 feet. The 2.4mm raised edge is one of the highest we’ve tested. Unlike most macho protective cases, it’s available in a range of colors depending on the model of iPhone 16, including one in a fetching pink. 4.

If you drop it, Smartish claims its air-pocket corners can withstand a drop from 6 feet, which should account for most non-giant-related accidents. Slightly less grippy but still grippier than most cases, the Smartish Gripmunk case has the same textured sides for a firmer hold than you’ll get with a glossy case. What is extra special about these Smartish cases is the ability to personalize the case back with a photo and text. This is easy to create on the Smartish website, uploading images and typing text until you have your perfect combination given the options available. For the Gripzilla case you are limited to the black case color, but you get further color options with the Gripmunk. The company also sells an iPhone 16 case with a built-in wallet. The Smartish Wallet Slayer Vol. 2 can hold three credit or travel cards, and this part of the case can also work as a kickstand that lets you prop up your phone in landscape orientation. As with similar wallet cases, having the cards at the back of your phone case adds convenience but removes the wireless charging opportunity—for which you will need to remove your phone from the case. 5. Rokform Rugged Case – Most protective iPhone 16 Case with mounts and magnets Pros Super protection level Bike/Car mount system Cons Slightly chunkier than others Not MagSafe compatible Price When Reviewed: $69.99 Best Prices Today: $69.99 at Rokform MagSafe compatible: No Weight: 75g Raised edge: 2mm Camera edge: 1mm Button covers: Plastic Action button: Cutout Camera Control: Cutout Colors: Black Available for: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max If you want your iPhone case to shout “Protection!”, Rokform’s aptly named Rugged Case looks the business. This is the phone case that Judge Dredd might carry in his holster. Like its clear-ish Crystal Case reviewed in our clear case section higher up, the Rugged Case features N52 Neodymium magnets that mean you can very securely clamp your encased iPhone onto any metal surface, plus Rokform’s RokLock twist-lock mounting system for twist-lock bike mounts, motorcycle mounts and car and golf-cart mounts. The impact-resistant polycarbonate protective shell features reinforced corners and extra camera protection that makes it a little chunkier than standard cases but reassuringly so, and not ridiculous. It is more rigid than the Zagg Denali Snap case, reviewed above, which also features a slightly more raised lip around the camera. In its current form it is sadly not compatible with MagSafe wireless charging, but a newer and slimmer version is in the works, promises the company. If wireless charging is something you require or desire while your iPhone 16 is still in the case, we’d recommend waiting for the upgraded version, which we will report here. The Camera Control is a cutout rather than a button, but the Action button is now covered. The buttons are plastic rather than the metal found on some other cases. Rokform claims the case can withstand drops of up to 6 feet (1.8m) due to its construction from a combination of high-impact polycarbonate and rugged TPU for impact resistance and cushioning. The Rugged Case comes in black only, while the Crystal Case will show off the iPhone’s true body color. 6. Pitaka Military-Grade Protective Case for iPhone 16 – Slim Protective iPhone 16 Case Pros Woven aramid fiber design Smooth texture Strong metal camera and button protection Cons Military-Grade Protective Case is iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max only Price When Reviewed: $79.99 Best Prices Today: $79.99 at Pitaka MagSafe compatible: Yes Weight: 33g Camera edge: 3mm Button covers: Metal Action button: Covered Camera Control: Cutout Colors: Black/gray, Sunset, Moonrise Available for: All iPhone 16 models Pitaka has a range of cases for the iPhone family, but we are particular fans of the Military-Grade Protective Case (from $69.99) that, as its name suggests, meets military-grade drop test standards. Unlike many of the cases reviewed here it boasts metal side buttons, although the Camera Control is a cutout. As with the other Pitaka cases, it is constructed from robust aerospace-grade aramid fiber (aromatic polyamide) blended with shockproof TPU sides. This tough material resists scratches, abrasions and exposure to chemicals. An added benefit is that this weave gives the case textured patterns that stand out from the crowd. Inside it is lined with soft Nappa leather to provide cushioning for the back of the phone. It is also slim and lightweight unlike chunkier protective cases and slides in and out of a pocket with ease. At present, the Military-Grade Protective Case is available for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max only. For all iPhone 16 models, the Pitaka Tactile Woven Case is thinner and even lighter (19.4g) and available in a series of woven designs, such as Sunset, Moonrise, Over The Horizon, and Milky Way Galaxy. There are also special versions, in collaboration with vintage fashion brand Aries, that incorporate Lumitex technology, which allows the case to self-illuminate in the dark after absorbing light energy. Designs include Alien, Credit Card, and NoProblemo. For the ultra-minimalist, the Pitaka Ultra Slim Case (18-35g) is available in Black/Grey, Forest Green, and Ocean Blue. Best leather iPhone cases for iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max Apple made a deliberate move away from leather with its accessories at the launch of the iPhone 15 and has stuck to its vegan ways with the iPhone 16. Apple’s alternative was a micro twill called FineWoven—however, customers were quick to complain that it easily picked up stains from just about anything it come into contact with, and the company has rightly abandoned it for its new iPhone. If you want a leather alternative we recommend the vegan leather MOFT MOVAS case, reviewed below. But if you are happier with the real animal skin thing, there are some great leather cases to choose from, as you’ll find by reading on. 1. Mujjo Full Leather Wallet Case for iPhone 16 – Best leather iPhone 16 case with wallet card holder Pros Stylish Wallet option Cons Cards prevent wireless charging Price When Reviewed: From $59 Best Prices Today: $59 at Mujjo$64 at Amazon MagSafe compatible: Yes (without cards) Weight: 35g (Full Leather Wallet Case) Raised edge: 1mm Button covers: Metal Action button: Covered (Pro \u0026 Max) Camera Control: Cutout Colors: Black, Dark Tan, Monaco Blue, Steel Blue, Livid Green, Green Smoke Available for: All iPhone 16 models Dutch designer Mujjo has been making some of our favorite leather Apple accessories for many years. It has four different cases available for the iPhone 16, three of them are crafted from premium leather and a new Eager to win some green points, the company points out that sustainable “DriTan water-free leather tanning” is involved—this uses the moisture already present in the hides. The buttons, camera bump, microfiber lining, and polycarbonate inner shell are made from recycled plastic. All the cases feature machined-metal buttons, 1mm raised bezel and a metal rear camera bump for superior protection. If you want a leather iPhone case with some extra benefits, the Mujjo Full Leather Wallet Case (for iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max) turns your iPhone into a physical as well as digital wallet. The leather card pocket can hold two or three bank, ID or travel cards. Note that the cards must be removed for wireless charging—even with cards removed, the magnetic connection is not as strong as with the cases that don’t include a wallet at the back, although it does still work with MagSafe chargers. To be fair, the same is true for all wallet-cases we tested. Available in Dark Tan, Black, or Monaco Blue. The Mujjo Full Leather Case (all models except the 16 Plus) is a more classic leather case without the wallet at the back, with a machined-metal rear camera bump that protects lenses. It’s available in a range of colors depending on the iPhone model. If you agree with Apple that leather is not for you, the Mujjo Maizcase is made with an Italian bio-leather, created with a blend of corn and other cereals and recycled polyester. It’s available in Steel Blue only. The Mujjo iPhone 16 Pro Shield Case (for iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max) is designed to be super protective, as the name suggests, and is available for the two Pro models of the 16. Mujjo claims that drop protection is rated to 15 feet (5m), and it features an “ImpactCore internal bumper”. Take your choice of colors from Black or Steel Blue. 2.

The Snap Case is made from MOFT’s own MOVAS-P, a four-layer soft-touch vegan leather that the company claims is non-fading and fingerprint, scratch and stain resistant. The side buttons are metal for better responsiveness and durability. The Camera Control is a cutout like on most of the non-Apple cases. The raised front edge is 1.3mm, offering excellent screen protection, and the camera cutout is elevated by 1mm. There is a special version that is compatible with a Phone Lanyard for hands-free use, priced separately at $29.99. 3. Decoded iPhone 16 Leather Detachable Wallet Case – Best wraparound wallet case Pros 360 protective cover Physical wallet Price When Reviewed: $80 Best Prices Today: $80 at Decoded MagSafe compatible: Yes Weight: 119g (16 Pro) Button covers: Metal Action button: Covered Camera Control: Cutout Colors: Tan Brown, Navy Blue, Clay Beige, Black Available for: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max Most wallet iPhone cases place the card slots at the back, which can hamper wireless MagSafe charging. The Decoded Leather Detachable Wallet Case is more flexible. It’s actually two cases in one as the standard case magnetically clamps onto a full-grain Ecco leather fold-out wraparound that features the wallet card slots behind the front panel. The detachable wallet includes three card slots, plus storage for banknotes. This front part offers double protection for the screen aside from the raised edge found on the case. There’s further magnetic magic on the folding closure. The case promises 1.2m drop protection, and the button covers are metal for further robustness and precise control. The whole package is surprisingly slim for a full wraparound wallet. You could place the bare phone straight onto the wraparound cover, but you’d lose the 360-degree protection should the phone be dropped. Decoded also offers a more traditional one-piece Leather Case, without the wallet wraparound part. 4.

It has three models of case for the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max only. Non-Pro iPhone owners look elsewhere. The Pebbled Leather Case has that classic textured leather grain pattern, made from Italian Pebbled Bovine Leather in Black, Navy and Dark Green. The Snowflake Leather Case is made from Italian Vegetable Tanned Snowflake Leather—also known as pueblo leather—with a glossier rugged surface coming through after 90 days usage. It’s available in Black, Jeans and Tabacco colors. The limited-edition Horween Leather Case is made from the iconic Horween Leather Company Chromexcel leather in Burgundy and Brown. Each of these iPhone 16 cases are MagSafe compatible and feature a robust 360-degree TPE bumper and 1mm raised ridge above the screen and camera lenses—with 5-foot drop protection. Uniquely, the company can personalize the case with a hand-debossing service that stamps your initials deeply into the leather’s surface. Best iPhone cases with lanyards Why stuff your iPhone into your trouser or coat pocket or deep into your handbag when you could wear it round your neck or across your shoulder for easier access? Several of the iPhone 16 cases we tested have lanyard options, which we mention in the reviews above or pick out here for particular attention. 1. MagEasy Odyssey Ultra and Roam for iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max Pros Lanyard options External pouch option Robust Price When Reviewed: $79.99 Best Prices Today: $79.99 at Amazon$79.99 at MagEasy MagSafe compatible: Yes Weight: 109g (16 Pro), 291g with lanyard Button covers: Plastic Action button: Covered Camera Control: Cutout Colors: Titanium (Odyssey); Titanium, Black, Rose, Clear (Roam); Black, Starlight White, Rose, Gray, Camel Brown (Pouch) Available for (Odyssey): iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max Available for (Roam): iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max Available for (Pouch): iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max MagEasy has a range of cases for the iPhone 16 family that feature detachable lanyards and even a wallet pouch that sits outside the case. Wearing your phone hanging from a lanyard can free up your hands while keeping the phone close for easy access. The chunkiest lanyard option comes with the most protective case, the $79 Odyssey Ultra Case—clearly the choice of Odysseus on his adventures. The case features interchangeable corners so you can replace the lanyard hooks with reinforced shockproof corners if you need protection rather than a neck-based strap. The 25mm Fidlock Utility Strap is not dainty in the least. This case has a central. ring stand that can rotate 360 degrees for precise adjustments in wither landscape and portrait orientation. It is U.S. military drop-test certified, providing protection from drops as high as 25 feet. The $35 Roam M + Strap Shockproof Protective Case with Lanyard boasts 16-foot drop protection and a less chunky design than the Odyssey. It offers a more elegant lanyard with integrated hooks. Looking quite unique, the $55 Pouch M Wallet Phone Case is a sleek 2-in-1 design that features a detachable wallet/purse with space for cards and folding cash. Coming with an adjustable leather strap, it can be worn over the shoulder or as a cross-body. Its zinc alloy clasp is well placed so that it doesn’t obstruct the camera lenses. MagEasy also offers a robust $39 MagStand 360 M with Rotating Ring Holder Protective Case, which doesn’t boast the lanyard option but is a solid and well-built clear iPhone 16 case with the same 360-degree ring stand as the Odyssey Ultra but with a lesser (but still impressive) 16-foot drop protection. Best bags and slings for iPhone 16 If you don’t want to have your iPhone sticking out of your back pocket for all the world to see and seize, or jammed into a tight front pocket, consider a small bag or sling to keep your new iPhone protected and held away from your person. 1. WaterField Shinjuku Sling Pros Stylish sling Tech organizer Price When Reviewed: $129 Best Prices Today: $129 at WaterField Designs Size: 8 x 2.5 x 5 inches (20.3 x 6.4 x 12.7cm Weight: 320g (Waxed), 150g (Canvas) Colors: Waxed Canvas: Navy or Brown; Canvas Storm Gray, Black or Olive Green Available for: All iPhone models WaterField Designs makes great bags and its mini crossbody Shinjuku Sling is aimed at owners of the iPhone 16. A sling keeps your iPhone and other essentials close at hand and handsfree but not ruining the cut of your clothes. You don’t always need a full backpack, and a small sling like this may be all you need on a day out or commute. There’s just one size that will fit either any model of iPhone. There are two materials to choose from: a heavy-duty 15oz Waxed Canvas with a naturally rugged, distressed look, or lightweight waterproof X-Pac Canvas, in various colors. At the front a zippered pocket can store frequently needed items like a travel card or reading glasses. Inside, with a light diamond-patterned lining, there’s a side pocket that is foam-padded to cradle the iPhone, and two stretch pockets for your AirPods or whatever small items you don’t want to keep in your pockets. There’s even space in the central compartment for a slim 16oz water bottle, as well as keys. At the back you’ll find (but thieves won’t see) a zippered pocket that’s perfect for cash or a passport. The strap features a quick-release buckle that lets attach it to a chair or other furniture to protect it from thieves when you’re seated. How we tested iPhone 16 cases We tested the reviewed cases above using an iPhone 16 Pro. We tested for fit, look and feel, build quality, and magnetic wireless charging. We did not test the claims for Military Grade Protection by throwing the encased phone from speeding trains or hot air balloons or throwing it to the pavement. We have to trust the manufacturer’s claims on this but we did examine the raised screen and camera edges for robustness.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",

    "description": "Losing Steve affected me more than it probably should have, given that I never met him or had any correspondence with him. But losing him was devastating — not just to my world, but the world. He was a sort of virtual father figure: I was always hoping that maybe Steve would notice something I did. We all wanted his attention and approval, and that drove us to do better work — even those of us who never worked at Apple. Nobody replaced him in this role. Nobody can. But as an outsider who had no personal relationship with him to mourn, it has been most depressing to consider how much of his work the world missed out on. He wasn’t taken from us after a long, complete life — he was taken in his prime. He had so much more to offer the world.",

    "title": "The future of the App Store",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2021/09/13/future-of-the-app-store",
    "description": "After the dust settles from the developer class-action settlement, the South Korean law, the JFTC announcement, and the Apple v. Epic decision, I think the most likely long-term outcome isn’t very different from the status quo — and that’s a good thing. Allowing external purchases Here’s what I think we’ll end up with: Apple will still require apps to use their IAP system for any qualifying purchases that occur in the apps themselves. All app types will be allowed to link out to a browser for other purchase methods. Most apps will be required to also offer IAP side-by-side with any external methods.1 Only “Reader apps” will be exempt from this requirement.2 Apple will have many rules regarding the display, descriptions, and behavior of external purchases, many of which will be unpublished and ever-changing. App Review will be extremely harsh, inconsistent, capricious, petty, and punitive with their enforcement.3 Apple won’t require price-matching between IAP and external purchases. These few but important corrections reduce Apple’s worst behavior and should relieve most regulatory pressure. The result won’t look much different than the status quo: Most big media apps (qualifying as “reader” apps) won’t offer IAP, but will finally be allowed to link to their websites from their apps and offer purchases there. Many games will offer both IAP and external purchases, with the external choice offering a discount, bonus gems, extra loot boxes, or other manipulative tricks to optimize the profitability of casino games for children (commissions from which have been the largest portion of Apple’s “services revenue” to date). Most importantly, many products, services, and business models will become possible that previously weren’t, leading to more apps, more competition, and more money going to more places. External purchase methods will evolve to be almost as convenient as IAP (especially if Apple Pay is permitted in this context), and payment processors will reduce the burden of manual credit-card entry with shared credentials available across multiple apps. The payment-fraud doomsday scenarios argued by Apple and many fans mostly won’t happen, in part because App Review will prevent most obvious cases, but also because parents don’t typically offer their credit cards to untrustworthy children; and for buyers of all ages, most credit cards themselves provide stronger fraud prevention and easier recourse from unwanted charges than the App Store ever has. No side-loading I don’t expect side-loading or alternative app stores to become possible, and I’m relieved, because that is not a future I want for iOS. When evaluating such ideas, I merely ask myself: “What would Facebook do?” Facebook owns four of the top ten apps in the world. If side-loading became possible, Facebook could remove Instagram, WhatsApp, the Facebook app, and Messenger from Apple’s App Store, requiring customers to install these extremely popular apps directly from Facebook via side-loading. And everyone would. Most people use a Facebook-owned app not because it’s a good app, but because it’s a means to an important end in their life. Social pressure, family pressure, and network lock-in prevent most users from seeking meaningful alternatives. People would jump through a few hoops if they had to. Facebook would soon have apps that bypassed App Review installed on the majority of iPhones in the world. Technical limitations of the OS would prevent the most egregious abuses, but there’s a lot they could still do. We don’t need to do much imagining — they already have attempted multiple hacks, workarounds, privacy invasions, and other unscrupulous and technically invasive behavior with their apps over time to surveil user behavior outside of their app and stay running longer in the background than users intend or expect. The OS could evolve over time to reduce some of these vulnerabilities, but technical measures alone cannot address all of them. Without the threat of App Review to keep them in check, Facebook’s apps would become even more monstrous than they already are. As a user and a fan of iOS, I don’t want any part of that. No alternative app stores Alternative app stores would be even worse. Rather than offering individual apps via side-loading, Facebook could offer just one: The Facebook App Store. Instagram, WhatsApp, the Facebook app, and Messenger could all be available exclusively there. The majority of iOS users in the world would soon install it, and Facebook would start using leverage in other areas — apps’ social accounts, stats packages, app-install ads, ad-attribution requirements — to heavily incentivize (and likely strong-arm) a huge number of developers to offer their apps in the Facebook App Store, likely in addition to Apple’s. Maybe I’d be required to add the Facebook SDK to my app in order to be in their store, which they would then use to surveil my users. Maybe I’d need to buy app-install ads to show up in search there at all. Maybe I’d need to pay Facebook to “promote” each app update to reach more than a tiny percentage of my existing customers. And Facebook wouldn’t even be the only app store likely to become a large player on iOS. Amazon would almost certainly bring their garbage “Appstore” to iOS, but at least that one probably wouldn’t go anywhere. Maybe Google would bring the Play Store to iOS and offer a unified SDK to develop a single codebase for iOS and Android, effectively making every app feel like an Android app and further marginalizing native apps when they’re already hurting. Media conglomerates that own many big-name properties, like Disney, might each have their own app stores for their high-profile apps. Running your own store means you can promote all of your own apps as much as you want. What giant corporation would resist? Don’t forget games! Epic and Steam would come to iOS with their own game stores. Maybe Microsoft and Nintendo, too. Maybe you’d need to install seven different app stores on your iPhone just to get the apps and games you already use — and all without App Review to keep them in check. Most developers would probably need to start submitting our apps to multiple app stores, each with its own rules, metadata, technical requirements, capabilities, approval delays, payment processing, stats, crash reports, ads, promotion methods, and user reviews. As a user, a multiple-app-store world sounds like an annoying mess; as a developer, it terrifies me. Apple’s App Store is the devil we know. The most viable alternatives that would crop up would be far worse. Course correction The way Apple runs its business isn’t perfect, but it’s also not a democracy. I loved this part of Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’ decision in Apple v. Epic, as quoted by Ben Thompson’s excellent article that you should read: Apple has not offered any justification for the actions other than to argue entitlement. Where its actions harm competition and result in supracompetitive pricing and profits, Apple is wrong. I interpret “entitlement” without a negative connotation here — Apple is entitled to run their platform mostly as they wish, with governmental interference only warranted to fix market-scale issues that harm large segments of commerce or society. As a developer, I’d love to see more changes to Apple’s control over iOS. But it’s hard to make larger changes without potentially harming much of what makes iOS great for both users and developers. Judge Gonzalez Rogers got it right: we needed a minor course correction to address the most egregiously anticompetitive behavior, but most of the way Apple runs iOS is best left to Apple. If the South Korean law holds, IAP may not be required — but only in South Korea. With this exception, I expect the rest of these rules to be enforced the same way globally. ↩︎ Apple defines “reader” apps as “[allowing] a user to access previously purchased content or content subscriptions (specifically: magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video).” This includes many apps that Apple’s services compete with, such as Netflix, Spotify, and Kindle, that raise anticompetitive concerns among regulators and legislators when forced to give Apple 30%. ↩︎ App Review has higher-level queues for managerial review of controversial rules or edge cases, typically identifiable from the outside by an app stuck with “In Review” status for days or weeks, and often ending in a phone call from “Bill”. I’d expect any app offering external purchases to have a very high chance of being escalated to a slower, more pain-in-the-ass review process, possibly causing it not to be worthwhile for most small developers to deal with. I have no plans to add external purchases to Overcast for multiple reasons, including this — but mostly because, for my purposes, I’m satisfied with Apple’s IAP system. ↩︎",

    "description": "Apple’s leaders continue to deny developers of two obvious truths: That our apps provide substantial value to iOS beyond the purchase commissions collected by Apple. That any portion of our customers came to our apps from our own marketing or reputation, rather than the App Store. For Apple to continue to deny these is dishonest, factually wrong, and extremely insulting — not only to our efforts, but to the intelligence of all Apple developers and customers. This isn’t about the 30%, or the 15%, or the prohibition of other payment systems, or the rules against telling our customers about our websites, or Apple’s many other restrictions. (Not today, at least.) It’s about what Apple’s leadership thinks of us and our work. *     *     * It isn’t the App Store’s responsibility to the rest of Apple to “pay its way” by leveraging hefty fees on certain types of transactions. Modern society has come to rely so heavily on mobile apps that any phone manufacturer must ensure that such a healthy ecosystem exists as table stakes for anyone to buy their phones. Without our apps, the iPhone has little value to most of its customers today. If Apple wishes to continue advancing bizarre corporate-accounting arguments, the massive profits from the hardware business are what therefore truly “pay the way” of the App Store, public APIs, developer tools, and other app-development resources, just as the hardware profits must fund the development of Apple’s own hardware, software, and services that make the iPhone appeal to customers. The forced App Store commissions, annual developer fees, and App Store Search Ads income are all just gravy. The “way” is already paid by the hardware — but Apple uses their position of power to double-dip. And that’s just business. Apple’s a lot of things, and “generous” isn’t one. But to bully and gaslight developers into thinking that we need to be kissing Apple’s feet for permitting us to add billions of dollars of value to their platform is not only greedy, stingy, and morally reprehensible, but deeply insulting. *     *     * Apple further extends the value argument, and defends their justification for forced commissions, by claiming responsibility for and ownership of the customer relationship between all iOS users and each app they choose to use. This argument only makes sense — and even then, only somewhat — when apps are installed by a customer browsing the App Store, finding an app they hadn’t previously heard of, and choosing to install it based on App Store influence alone. But in the common case — and for most app installations, the much more common case — of searching for a specific app by name or following a link or ad based on its developer’s own marketing or reputation, Apple has served no meaningful role in the customer acquisition and “deserves” nothing more from the transaction than what a CDN and commodity credit-card processor would charge. The idea that the App Store is responsible for most customers of any reasonably well-known app is a fantasy. It isn’t the App Store that has enabled all of the commerce on iOS — it’s the entire world of computing and modern society, created by a symbiotic ecosystem in which Apple played one part alongside many others. The world was already moving in this direction, and had Apple not played its part, someone else would’ve. The App Store is merely one platform’s forced distribution gateway, “facilitating” the commerce no more and no less than a web browser, an ISP or cellular carrier, a server-hosting company, or a credit-card processor. For Apple to continue to claim otherwise is beyond insulting, and borders on delusion. *     *     * At WWDC next week, these same people are going to try to tell us a different story. They’re going to tell us how amazing we are, how important our work is, and how much they value us. And for thousands of Apple employees who’ve made the great products and platforms that we love, including the hundreds of engineers presenting the sessions and working the labs, it’ll be genuine and true. But the leaders have already shown us who they really are, what they really think of us, and how much they value our work. Please forgive some sloppiness in my metaphors or phrasing — my writing skills are pretty rusty — and I’ll return the favor to anyone who responds.",

    "title": "In-App Purchase Rules",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2020/09/11/app-review-changes",
    "description": "A summary of today’s changes to 3.1.3 Other Purchase Methods: Your app must use Apple’s in-app-purchase (IAP) system for all purchases made in the app. Unless they’re purchases for goods or services that are consumed outside the app, in which case you are prohibited from using IAP. Unless those goods or services consumed outside the app are magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, or video, in which case, you are required to use IAP. But if your app only “reads” previously purchased magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, or video, and doesn’t mention the possibility of purchases anywhere in the app, you don’t need to use IAP. Unless you offer account creation, in which case, you are required to use IAP. Unless you only offer free account creation, in which case, you don’t need to use IAP. But if you offer paid upgrades from free accounts within the app, you are required to use IAP. Except for accounts that were created outside the app, which can offer paid account upgrades and don’t need to use IAP. If you’re selling “experiences” between people, you don’t need to use IAP. Unless those “experiences” include three or more people, or aren’t consumed live, in which case, you are required to use only IAP. If your purchase is for services, features, or game items, you are required to use only IAP. Unless you operate on multiple platforms, in which case, you can also offer purchasing outside the app. But you can’t tell anyone about it. Unless you get their contact info somewhere else, in which case, you can tell them about it, but not in the app. You are required to use IAP even if you sell your app or service directly to other people. Unless you only sell it to businesses or groups for their employees or students to use, in which case, you still must use IAP, but you can include your own payment method as well. Unless those groups are families, or unless those employees or students are somehow “consumers”, in which case, you must only use IAP. Do I have that right? *     *     * How about an alternative that’s clear, fair, reasonable, and consistently enforceable? Apps may offer other payment mechanisms in their app, as long as terms are clear and customers aren’t misled, and may or may not choose to implement in-app purchase based on its merits. In one stroke, antitrust and regulatory pressure disappear, developer relations are significantly repaired, and Apple can go back to spending its time, resources, PR, and political capital on making their products better and customers happier.",

    "title": "Introducing Voice Boost 2: Remaster your podcasts",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2020/01/31/voiceboost2",
    "description": "The latest update to Overcast includes a feature that I’m especially proud of that took over a year to build. Voice Boost 2 is an all-new audio engine that includes professional-grade, mastering-quality loudness normalization. When I first introduced Overcast in 2014, Voice Boost was one of its headlining features: Voice Boost is a combination of dynamic compression and equalization that can make many shows more listenable and normalize volume across all shows. This makes amateur-produced podcasts (including many of my favorites) more listenable in loud environments, like cars, where you’d otherwise need to crank the volume so loudly to hear the quiet parts that you’d blow your ears out when the loudest person spoke. Voice Boost 2 achieves the same goal as the original Voice Boost, but with dramatically more sophisticated methods, leading to more consistent results and much better sound quality. Goals When I wrote the original Voice Boost with only a rudimentary understanding of audio processing, it was a single configuration of Apple’s AudioUnits that applied a fixed set of parameters to all podcasts, regardless of their audio characteristics. It was an effective but blunt tool, relying on aggressive level compression and a strong EQ to make the compression less noticeable. Since then, I’ve edited over 500 podcasts, learned a lot more about how to master them properly, and developed a much better understanding of audio signal processing. I set out to develop a better, smarter, and more refined Voice Boost that took advantage of everything I’d learned, with these audio goals: The effect should be much more subtle: mostly just consistent volume, plus slightly smoother tone. It should analyze the input audio and apply just enough processing to achieve a consistent volume level, modifying already-good audio as little as possible. It should sound good, and consistent, regardless of the volume dynamics of its input. Quality should be so good that I can even play high-quality music through it1 and not notice any artifacts. And these technical goals: Like Smart Speed and the original Voice Boost, it had to work as a streaming process, easily toggled on and off at will, without needing to scan the entire file first or look very far ahead. The code had to be pure C, with highly optimized and vectorized code, so it wouldn’t be a major power drain on older phones and could potentially run on much lower-power devices as well. I had to write every component from scratch, without using AudioUnits, because I wanted to understand and control everything, ensure the highest performance and sound quality, and avoid Apple’s platform-specific API limits.2 It had to be modular and easily customizable, like a channel strip in an audio editor, so I could adjust the processing during development and testing, offer user customization down the road, and use the same engine to build myself a modular podcast-preproduction tool to save time in my weekly workflow (which I’ve been using for over a year).3 Live LUFS normalization Since Voice Boost is mostly about high-quality volume analysis and loudness normalization, I went straight to the top, implementing the ITU BS.1770–4 standard that gives us the LUFS measurement seen in high-end audio editors. Overcast now measures and adjusts podcast levels using this broadcast-standard perceptual loudness algorithm, at full quality, with no preprocessing. Voice Boost 2 normalizes all podcasts to –14 LUFS — a level I chose because it closely matches the volume of Siri and most iOS turn-by-turn navigation voices, so when you’re listening to a podcast while driving, navigation interruptions are less jarring. Most professionally produced podcasts are already mastered to similar volume levels, so Voice Boost 2 won’t overcompress them with aggressive processing — it’ll only apply as much correction as necessary to make them all the same volume. A brief tutorial on clipping and distortion This is about to get nerdier, but bear with me. (Yes, nerdier than ITU broadcast-loudness standards.) Given a loudness measurement for the incoming audio, quieter podcasts need to be amplified to reach the target. But perceived loudness isn’t the peak of the incoming audio stream — it’s more of an average. Quiet-sounding audio can still have brief moments of loud peaks. When increasing the volume of digital audio, the biggest challenge is not “clipping” during the peaks — not having any part of the signal pass above the volume ceiling of 0 dB. (It’s a negative scale. This is also why the LUFS value above, which is closely related to the decibel scale used here, is negative.) Here’s the highest the signal should go, showing the individual audio samples (green dots) that can be processed by a podcast app before the DAC transforms them into audio (smooth green line): It’ll sound right as long as the audio doesn’t cross above that top line (0 dB). Increase the volume even slightly too far, and some of the samples just slam into it and stay there, losing the tops of their smooth curves: And that sounds terrible. But I can’t just cap all the samples right below the limit and call it a day — that’s called a brickwall limiter — because then the shape of the audio line will actually represent different frequencies, telling the DAC to add noise that wasn’t really there. Here, the bottom of each image shows the frequency breakdown: The unclipped signal (left) shows only its original frequency of about 2100 Hz, but a basic brickwall limiter (right) results in the unwanted introduction of a bunch of extra frequencies. That’s distortion. (If this is interesting to you, learn more about audio sampling theory here.) Lookahead limiter Avoiding audible distortion requires a lookahead limiter, which looks… ahead (😎) at the audio coming down the pipeline, and smoothly ramps the volume amplification down as a loud peak is approaching, then back up again afterward, just enough to avoid clipping and audible distortion, but so quickly that you don’t notice.4 After Voice Boost 2’s complete 32-bit audio processing pipeline, the last stage is a lookahead limiter, configured such that it can’t clip, no matter what audio comes through. This gives vast flexibility in volume processing without sacrificing quality. Voice Boost 2 also incorporates a dynamics compressor, but over time, I’ve kept reducing its strength as I’ve found it less necessary. Proper LUFS processing with a great lookahead limiter provides excellent volume normalization with almost no compression needed afterward. True-peak detection There’s one more way to introduce clipping that needs to be guarded against. Digital audio is represented by samples that represent a point in time (green dots, again) on a sound wave (green line). But the sampled points don’t always land at the exact peaks of those waves: The most common way to measure the peak of a waveform is to find the greatest absolute sample value. By this method, the top waveform peaks here would measure about –6 dB and –1.5 dB, respectively. But the actual peak amplitudes of these waves is –1 dB! A simple limiter could still output clipped audio because it’s not seeing the true peaks. Voice Boost 2’s limiter performs true-peak detection, rather than simply measuring sample peaks, to avoid this type of clipping and further reduce distortion. Mastering-quality processing for everyone Voice Boost 2 is a mastering-quality audio-processing pipeline that applies broadcast-standard loudness normalization, light compression and EQ, and a true-peak lookahead limiter to your podcasts, in real time, without sacrificing quality or battery life. And it runs at less than 1% CPU usage on an iPhone SE.5 I intend to expose some of its customizability to customers in future updates, but I wanted to develop and ship the best default settings first to keep the app simple and usable to everyone. Now that it’s available to everyone, I may still subtly tweak the defaults in response to feedback. But as I’ve refined the settings during the beta period to be more universal, less customization has been necessary.6 Having achieved its goals of being more consistent and less aggressive, Voice Boost 2 is intentionally transparent. It’s not promoted more in the app or even labeled “Voice Boost 2”. It’s still Voice Boost — just better now. If I did my job well, you’ll hardly notice it at all. You’ll have no idea that your podcasts are being remastered in your pocket. But I’ll know. And the handful of you who really care will know. And that’s enough for me. Voice Boost 2 is in today’s update (2020.1), along with these new features: AirPlay 2: Overcast can now play to HomePods and other AirPlay 2 devices much more responsively, with full-blown Smart Speed and Voice Boost, on iOS 13.1 and above.7 Skip intros/outros: There’s a new per-podcast setting to skip a given number of seconds from the start and/or end of its episodes. Clip-sharing from private feeds. In retrospect, this restriction was unnecessary, so I lifted it. Restored iOS 12 compatibility. Going 13-only so soon was a mistake. Hear why on Under The Radar 181 and 183. As usual, all of this is free for everyone in Overcast. Those awesome Trey Anastasio acoustic shows are pretty quiet. ↩︎ Apple doesn’t make all of their audio APIs available on all platforms: some are Mac-only and never came to iOS, and watchOS has an even smaller subset than iOS. The more I can accomplish in my own code, the less I depend on Apple’s choices for which APIs they make available to developers. ↩︎ It’s just a command-line tool for now. You don’t want it. (But if you do… someday, maybe.) ↩︎ This all happens in milliseconds. ↩︎ At 1X, with Smart Speed enabled. Smart Speed was actually entirely rewritten as part of Voice Boost 2, but it’s less interesting. It performs the same job as before, but much more efficiently, and taking advantage of the measured loudness when Voice Boost is also enabled. ↩︎ For instance, I also built a de-esser into Voice Boost 2, but it slowly became unnecessary as I improved the other processing, so it’s not currently enabled. ↩︎ Smart Speed is a big deal here, I think — I’m not aware of any other podcast apps with silence-skipping over AirPlay 2. (Or LUFS normalization, or true-peak lookahead limiters.) ↩︎",

    "title": "Low Power Mode for Mac laptops: making the case again",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2020/01/13/macos-low-power-mode-redux",
    "description": "In light of today’s rumor that a Pro Mode may be coming that seems to offer benefits in the opposite direction,1 I wanted to re-make the case for a Low Power Mode on macOS — and explain why now is the time. Modern hardware constantly pushes thermal and power limits, trying to strike a balance that minimizes noise and heat while maximizing performance and battery life. Software also plays a role, trying to keep everything background-updated, content-indexed, and photo-analyzed so it’s ready for us when we want it, but not so aggressively that we notice any cost to performance or battery life. Apple’s customers don’t usually have control over these balances, and they’re usually fixed at design time with little opportunity to adapt to changing circumstances or customer priorities. The sole exception, Low Power Mode on iOS, seems to be a huge hit: by offering a single toggle that chooses a different balance, people are able to greatly extend their battery life when they know they’ll need it.2 Mac laptops need Low Power Mode, too. I believe so strongly in its potential because I’ve been using it on my laptops (in a way) for years, and it’s fantastic. I’ve been disabling Intel Turbo Boost on my laptops with Turbo Boost Switcher Pro most of the time since 2015. In 2018, I first argued for Low Power Mode on macOS with a list of possible tweaks, concluding that disabling Turbo Boost was still the best bang-for-the-buck tweak to improve battery life without a noticeable performance cost in most tasks.3 Recently, as Intel has crammed more cores and higher clocks into smaller form factors and pushed thermal limits to new extremes, the gains have become even more significant. Here’s some thermal testing from my 8-core 16-inch MacBook Pro: \u003c!-- .turboboosttable { margin: 2em auto; border-collapse: collapse; } .turboboosttable th, .turboboosttable td { text-align: center; border: 1px solid #f4f4f4; padding: 0.5em; } .turboboosttable th { width: 15%; } .turboboosttable th.lcol { text-align: right; } .turboboosttable th.notbold { font-weight: normal; } .turboboosttable th { background-color: #f4f4f4; } .turboboosttable .lightslash { opacity: 0.33; } .turboboosttable td.noturbo { background-color: #f8f8f8; } .turboboosttable .perfminus { color: #a00; } .turboboosttable .perfplus { color: #0a0; } --\u003e 16-inch MacBook Pro (Late 2019, 2.4 GHz 8-core i9)   Power Temp. Geekbench 5 single/multi xcodebuild Normal 82W 90°C 1260/7386 39 sec. No Turbo 31W−62% 65°C 669/5206−46/29% 62 sec.+59% With Turbo Boost disabled, peak CPU power consumption drops by 62%, with a correspondingly huge reduction in temperature. This has two massive benefits: The fans never audibly spin up. When Turbo Boost is enabled, the fans annoyingly spin up every time the system is under a heavy sustained load. Disable it, and it’s almost impossible to get them to be audible. It runs significantly cooler. Turbo Boost lets laptops get too hot to comfortably hold in your lap, and so much heat radiates out that it can make hands sweaty. Disable it, and the laptop only gets moderately warm, not hot, and hands stay comfortably dry. I haven’t done formal battery testing on the 16-inch, since it’s so difficult and time-consuming to do in a controlled way that’s actually useful to people, but anecdotally, I’m seeing similar battery gains by disabling Turbo Boost that I’ve seen with previous laptops: significantly longer battery life that I’d estimate to be between 30–50%. This comes at a cost to performance, but: It’s not noticeable on most workloads. Parallel workloads are affected far less than single-threaded tasks, and most modern heavy workloads are parallelized. This is an 8-core laptop that’s competitive with my iMac Pro! It’s much faster than most people need (myself included) most of the time, so I can spare some performance to get other benefits. A fast laptop isn’t very useful if your hands are too sweaty to type, the battery dies in the middle of a flight, or the loud fans ruin your audio recording. When I really want to maximize performance, Turbo Boost Switcher Pro lets me quickly toggle it in the menu bar, so switching between modes is easy. The vast majority of the time I’m using it, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a much better laptop with Turbo Boost disabled. It’s still fast enough to do everything I need (including significant development with Xcode), while remaining silent and cool, with incredible battery life. But soon, I bet I won’t be able to do this anymore. Turbo Boost Switcher Pro relies on a kernel extension that’s grandfathered into Apple’s latest security requirements, but it can never be updated — and when macOS Catalina loads it for the first time, it warns that it’ll be “incompatible with a future version of macOS.” I suspect that this is the last year I’ll get to run the latest OS and be able to turn off Turbo Boost at will, making all of my future laptop usage significantly worse. Please, Apple, make this feature official: give us a Low Power Mode for macOS that disables Turbo Boost to keep our laptops cool, quiet, and long-lasting at times when those are more important to us than speed. My guess is that “Pro Mode” doesn’t raise the peak performance, but instead raises the fan speeds to allow longer sustained operation at high Turbo Boost speeds. ↩︎ Low Power Mode has been so successful on iOS that Apple also thought it worthwhile to add a Low Data Mode to iOS 13, offering similar control over data usage. (Mac owners can get similar functionality with the excellent TripMode.) ↩︎ As I wrote back then, disabling discrete GPUs and Photos analysis are other obvious contributors to a good Mac Low Power Mode. ↩︎",

    "title": "The 16-inch MacBook Pro",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2019/11/13/mbp16",
    "description": "After my first day with the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, I’m very optimistic about it. 🎧  Hear more on today’s Accidental Tech Podcast! Two years ago, I wrote a wishlist to fix the MacBook Pro, and the 16-inch doesn’t actually deliver most of it. But time and technological progress are slowly getting Apple off the hook: The ports are unchanged. We’ll still need dongles. But USB-C is gradually becoming more common, and dongles are slowly — very slowly — getting less shitty. The Touch Bar isn’t optional. But a new hardware Esc key removes one of its biggest drawbacks, and accidental input should be reduced by the increased spacing between the Touch Bar and the top row of keys. The power brick still lacks its previous conveniences. There’s still no cable management, safety breakaway, or charging LED. But third parties are slowly filling some of these gaps. The headphone jack is still on the right (wrong) side, despite most single-sided headphone cables entering the left earcup. But the need for wired headphones is decreasing over time. Addressing those would be nice, but as I wrote then, they paled in comparison to one huge issue: the butterfly keyboard. The MacBook Pro must return to scissor keyswitches. If Apple only changes one thing about the next MacBook Pro, it should be this. It’s far more important than anything else on this list. […] The Magic Keyboard’s scissor switches feel similar, but with a bit more travel, and all of the reliability and resilience of previous keyboard generations. […] The Magic Keyboard only needs one change to be perfect for the MacBook Pro: returning to the “inverted-T” arrow-key arrangement by making the left- and right-arrow keys half-height again. This arrangement is much more natural and less error-prone because we can align our fingers by feeling the “T” shape, a crucial affordance for such frequently used keys that are so far from the home row. That’s exactly what they’ve done, and I couldn’t be happier. The new 16-inch MacBook Pro is a great computer in most other ways, but so were the MacBook Pros from the last few years. They were fast, powerful, capable workstations… but the butterfly keyboard took away from it all. Not anymore. I’m on cloud nine. Look at this glorious keyboard! An Esc key! Inverted-T arrow keys! A millimeter of key travel! Enough spacing between the keys for our fingers to accurately orient themselves! And keystrokes will probably work, 100% of the time, for years! Five years ago, nobody would’ve considered any of these noteworthy, and readers would’ve suspected you weren’t of sound mind if you included them in a review. Five years ago, laptop keyboards were fine. Everyone was pretty much satisfied with the ones they had, they worked, and we never had to talk or think about them. Today, finally, we begin heading back to that world. The butterfly keyboard was an anomaly — it was a huge departure from everything else we’d ever used, mostly not in good ways. The new keyboard is very similar to the recent desktop Magic Keyboard, and I expect it to have a wide appeal, just as the Magic Keyboard does. It has slightly less travel and spacing, but the overall feeling is very similar — and it’s nothing at all like the butterfly keyboard. I absolutely love it — not because it’s the most amazing keyboard in the world, but because it’s completely forgettable in the best possible way. It just feels normal again. There’s a lot more to love about the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The screen and battery are bigger, but the size and weight barely increased. It’s almost as fast as my iMac Pro, and the new thermals can sustain higher performance. The speakers and microphone got huge, unexpected improvements. And I didn’t get everything I wanted. But many of my wishlist items fall outside of what Apple is likely to ever do, and all of them are much less important than making the computer’s primary input device functional, acceptable, and reliable. Now we have the luxury of being able to complain about less-urgent wishes. The biggest change is that I finally don’t feel like it’s constantly fighting me. Its design doesn’t feel spiteful. It’s a computer that doesn’t seem to hate being a computer. I’m not afraid to use it in the world, and I’m not avoiding using it because it’s unpleasant. The butterfly keyboard was the opposite, it never got better, I never got used to it, and good riddance to it. Following in the footsteps of the fantastic iMac Pro, updated Mac Mini, and upcoming Mac Pro, the release of the 16-inch MacBook Pro ends a painful chapter of neglect and hubristic design of the Mac. Apple has finally turned the ship around. We haven’t had long enough to fully test it yet. There may be flaws or shortcomings discovered over time — there usually are (and always have been). But frankly, it could catch fire twice a week and it would still be my favorite laptop Apple has made since 2015. Fortunately, upon initial usage, nothing bad really jumps out. The new MacBook Pro has no massive asterisks or qualifications. It’s a great computer, period, and it feels so good to be able to say that again. For the first time in years, without any major exceptions, we can see that Apple loves computers as much as we do. 🎧  Much more detail and discussion in the podcast!",

    "title": "Overcast summer update",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2019/07/21/overcast-summer-update",
    "description": "Today’s Overcast update (2019.6) brings some great new features. But first, I need to set low expectations for iOS 13, watchOS 6, and macOS Catalina updates this fall. Halfway through the summer, I’ve made much less progress than expected, having been overwhelmed by the required OS changes, my own technical and design debts, and unusually rough betas. Rather than shipping a big iOS update, a standalone Watch app, and a Mac app on day one, these will probably come incrementally over the next year. Fortunately, I haven’t stopped improving the app in the meantime. Per-podcast customization, longer clips You can now set download-vs.-stream and auto-delete behavior per podcast, one of the most frequently requested features over the last few years. (Sorry it took so long — it required a lot of server-side work for uninteresting reasons.) I’ve also raised the clip-sharing length limit to 90 seconds. When I debuted this feature, I had to guess how it would be used and received, and 60 seconds seemed like a good limit. In practice, that’s sometimes a bit too short to capture a complete thought. 90 seconds should be better — most clips won’t need to be that long, but it’ll be nice to have the headroom when you need it. “Suggestions for You” replacing Twitter Overcast has had a Twitter-powered social-recommendations feature since version 1.0 in 2014, which made sense at the time: I didn’t have any popularity data to generate recommendations from, and social networks were nicer places to be than they are today. But after five years, only 10% of active users have connected a Twitter account in Overcast, and only 0.2% of new podcast subscriptions have actually been added via Twitter recommendations. Not only was the feature not providing much value to the 10% of people who enabled it, but the other 90% of Overcast’s customers haven’t been getting personalized recommendations at all. In the meantime, I’ve accumulated five years of popularity data, so I tried writing my own recommendation engine. It worked — and it’s better. Overcast now offers its own data-driven recommendation engine, and I’ve removed Twitter integration entirely. Podcasts in the new “Suggestions for You” section of the Add Podcast screen are based on the shows you subscribe to, and what else their subscribers subscribe to, which gives much better recommendations without involving any social networks. Most importantly, it works for all of Overcast’s customers. *     *     * As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Give it a try.",

    "description": "Something big changed at Apple around the beginning of 2017. They had encountered significant turbulence in the product line over the preceding years, especially Macs. It was a rough time to be a pro Mac user. The “trash can” 2013 Mac Pro addressed only a fraction of the needs solved by the previous “cheese grater” towers, aged quickly without critical upgrade paths, and suffered from high GPU-failure rates from its cooling solution — all because its design prioritized size and appearance over performance and versatility in the one Mac model that should never make that tradeoff. Over the next few years, it became clear that the Mac Pro was an embarrassing, outdated flop that Apple seemed to have little intention of ever updating, leaving its customers feeling unheard and abandoned. I think Apple learned a small lesson from it, but they learned a much bigger one a few years later. The current MacBook Pro generation launched in late 2016, and I think Apple was truly caught completely by surprise when the new Touch Bar, sparse USB-C-only port offerings, high prices, and highly polarizing butterfly keyboard were met with harsh criticism, mixed reviews, and high failure rates. This one really hurt: while the Mac Pro is a niche machine for the highest-end and most-specialized needs, the popular MacBook Pro is the lifeblood of the Mac. By the end of 2016, in addition to the generally buggy, neglected state macOS seemed to be perpetually stuck in, Apple had replaced its entire “pro” Mac lineup with controversial, limiting products that seemed optimized to flex Apple’s industrial-design muscles rather than actually addressing their customers’ needs. The only company that can make computers for our OS seemed incapable of making good computers anymore. Each update threatened to remove or break things we needed or loved. Their newest designs felt punitive, rather than feeling like a celebration of computing. Then, in April 2017, out of nowhere, Apple held a Mac Pro roundtable discussion with the press to announce that they were in the early stages of completely redesigning the Mac Pro.1 The follow-up briefing a year later promised that the new Mac Pro would be released in 2019, and publicized the existence of a “Pro Workflow Team” of real pro users working inside Apple to inform the direction of their pro hardware and software. It sounded like they’d gone from not listening to their customers at all to an institutionalized process of listening. And the newly designed Macs released since then have been great.2 The late-2017 iMac Pro, which I’m using to write this, is the best Mac I’ve ever owned by far. It’s versatile, incredibly powerful, beautiful, and silent. It’s so good that I’ll probably never really need a Mac Pro again,3 and if this was the only new “Mac Pro”, I’d be mostly fine with that. The late-2018 Mac Mini replaced a pitiful, punitive, neglected relic with a practical, powerful mini-Mac-Pro. Apple could’ve let it die, or replaced it with a tiny, no-port marvel of uselessness, but instead, they made a computer so good that I started and ended a YouTube mini-career just to review it. And the 2019 Mac Pro, finally unveiled last week, looks to be absolutely killer — it’s the first true successor to the tower Mac Pro, which saw its last real update almost a decade ago in 2010.4 It’s big, bulky, ludicrously fast, and almost obscenely upgradeable — exactly what a Mac Pro needs to be, and far better than any of us expected. The new Mac Pro is, truly, a celebration of computing. Even more importantly than any hardware releases, macOS itself has also seen massive engineering effort recently. For the first time in a decade, the Mac was a major focus of WWDC, with great new APIs poised to usher in a huge wave of fresh software. To be fair, this story hasn’t ended yet. The Mac Pro isn’t actually out yet (and will be very expensive), they still need to resolve the problematic MacBook Pro with its next generation (rumors are promising), and the lack of standalone Apple displays under six thousand dollars really hurts the Mac Pro story.5 But I’m optimistic for the first time in years. It’s hard to tell when Apple is listening. They speak concisely, infrequently, and only when they’re ready, saying absolutely nothing in the meantime, even when we’re all screaming about a product line as if it’s on fire. They make great progress, but often with courageous losses that never get reversed, so an extended silence because we’re stuck with a change forever is indistinguishable from an extended silence because the fix isn’t ready yet. But there has clearly been a major shift in direction for the better since early 2017, and they couldn’t be more clear now: Apple is listening again, they’ve still got it, and the Mac is back. Based on what we’ve learned since, they had likely started the project a very short time before holding the roundtable. ↩︎ I’m excluding the 2018 MacBook Air because it feels like a stopgap that wasn’t originally planned to exist — the no-Touch-Bar 13” MacBook “Escape” seemed intended to replace it — that was rushed into the 2016-era generation mid-cycle, rather than being the first of a new design. Even so, with the large exception of the butterfly keyboard, it’s quite good. ↩︎ This doesn’t necessarily mean I won’t buy one. ↩︎ The 2010/“2012” Mac Pro was so good, and so upgradeable, that it’s still in surprisingly widespread use today for needs that weren’t possible or compelling on the “trashcan” successor. ↩︎ And the MacBook Pro. A very common setup for developers — Apple’s largest identified segment of pro users — is a 15” MacBook Pro connected to an external monitor, for which a good solution no longer exists. Developers would be much better served by a $1,500-ish standalone version of the iMac’s 5K display than a $6,000 XDR reference monitor for professional video colorists. ↩︎",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2019/04/27/overcast-clip-sharing",
    "description": "Sharing podcasts has never been easy, but I’ve always tried to lead the way with Overcast, with publicly shareable episode links and optional recommendations from your Twitter friends since version 1.0 in 2014. Podcast sharing has been limited to audio and links, but today’s social networks are more reliant on images and video, especially Instagram. Podcasts need video clips to be shared more easily today. I’ve seen some video clips from tools specific to certain podcast networks or hosts, but they were never available to everyone, or for every show. So people mostly just haven’t shared podcast clips, understandably, because it has been too hard. Not anymore. ▶️ ↩️ This remark on Unco by Stephen Hackett inspired me to finally solve this problem in a way that worked easily, for all podcasts, for both podcasters and listeners to use. With today’s 2019.4 update1, you can now share audio or video clips, up to a minute each, from any public podcast. Simply tap the share button in the upper-right corner. You can generate an audio clip, or portrait, landscape, or square video, using your current Overcast theme setting. In order to help spread podcasts further, I didn’t want to be heavy-handed in the Overcast branding — not everyone wants to advertise for one specific podcast app when promoting their shows. So the “Shared with Overcast” badge is optional, and if you’d like, you can also add an Apple Podcasts badge. Finally, I wanted to extend the same app-agnosticism to Overcast’s share links. While this design still needs a lot of modernization, I’ve done a small refresh: Now, for non-logged-in visitors, Overcast’s public sharing pages display badges for other podcast apps and the RSS feed for any podcast listed in Apple Podcasts. It’s important for me to promote other apps like this, and to make it easy even for other people’s customers to benefit from Overcast’s sharing features, because there are much bigger threats than letting other open-ecosystem podcast apps get a few more users. For podcasting to remain open and free, we must not leave major shortcomings for proprietary, locked-down services to exploit.2 Conversely, the more we strengthen the open podcast ecosystem with content, functionality, and ease of use, the larger the barrier becomes that any walled garden must overcome to be compelling. One of the most common shortcomings we hear is that podcasts are hard to share. Hopefully, Overcast’s new clip-sharing feature changes that, and other apps build similar features soon. So go get Overcast and start sharing your favorite moments. It’ll help me, of course, but more importantly, it’ll help your favorite shows gain listeners, and it’ll strengthen the amazing, open, standards-based world of podcasting. Like Slopes and Castro, I’ve changed to a date-based version-numbering scheme — 2019.4 is the fourth update released in 2019, the next version will be 2019.5, and so on — partly because version numbers don’t really matter anymore, but mostly because I no longer wanted to delay completed features until a major-version change or worry that I didn’t do enough to justify a certain number. ↩︎ YouTube was able to dominate video because it made everything easy in a medium that (at the time) was very hard to do elsewhere. If a proprietary service takes a very hard aspect of podcasting and makes it very easy, it may rapidly rise to prominence. Other major shortcomings I’m concerned about: the difficulty of getting sponsorships for small shows (“AdSense for podcasts”), and the complexity of creation and publishing (“Tumblr for podcasts”). This is probably why Spotify bought Anchor. ↩︎",

    "description": "▶️ The first thing someone does in a podcast app is add some podcasts, and most active Overcast users add at least two new podcasts each month. Over 80% of podcasts are added to Overcast by searching, with the vast majority as searches for a specific podcast by name (rather than searching for generic keywords, such as “business”). Good search is a critical, differentiating feature of any podcast app. I’m not satisfied if the podcast you’re looking for is somewhere in the middle of a long list — I want it to be the first one, displayed quickly, after typing the fewest characters possible. I’ve been building toward this by analyzing years of popularity statistics and anonymous search data. Instant Search is the next step in Overcast’s search evolution. It combines a small local cache with a highly optimized search service to give the most relevant results immediately as you type, even after only a single letter.1 It’s a dramatic, delightful improvement to a critical, frequently used feature. This was a lot of fun to build, and I’m proud of it. See for yourself! Overcast is free on the App Store. If Instant Search isn’t instant right after you update, the cache hasn’t fully downloaded yet. It’s downloaded weekly, only on Wi-Fi, and is less than 5 MB. ↩︎",

Until last week, I thought it would be the last Mac Mini that Apple ever made. And when rumors started swirling about an imminent Mac Mini update, I assumed the worst: if it came at all, it would be a tiny box with a slow, ultra-low-power processor and almost zero ports, optimizing for small size instead of versatility. I don’t think this was an unreasonable fear after the 2014 Mac Mini update, which made many key aspects much worse without making anything much better. It seemed clear then, and for the following four years that it went without an update, that Apple held the Mac Mini and its customers in very low regard. Not anymore. The 2018 Mac Mini is real, and it’s spectacular. It makes almost nothing worse and almost everything better, finally bringing the Mac Mini into the modern age. Ports! Glorious ports! Number one — and this is a big one these days, especially for this product — is that it’s not any less useful or versatile than the outgoing Mac Mini, including the generous assortment of ports. If the previous one served a role for you, the new one can probably do it just as well, and probably better and faster, with minimal donglage.2 It’s the same size as the old one, which is the right tradeoff. I know zero Mac Mini owners who really need it to get smaller, and many who don’t want it to get fewer ports or worse performance. The point of the Mac Mini is to be as versatile as possible, addressing lots of diverse and edge-case needs that the other Macs can’t with their vastly different form factors and more opinionated designs. The Mac Mini needs to be a utility product, not a design statement. (Although, even as someone tired of space-gray everything, I have to admit that the Mini looks fantastic in its new color.) The base price has increased to $800, and that’s not great. It’s partly justifiable because it’s much higher-end than before — the processors are much better, the architecture is higher-end and includes big advances like the T2, and all-SSD is standard — but it’s still an expensive product in absolute terms. Apple lent me a high-end configuration for review — 6-core i7, 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD — which would cost $2499 (much of which is the SSD). This would’ve sounded crazy to spend on a Mac Mini a few years ago, but when it’s specced up like this, it’s targeting a much higher-end market than the previous model could. Compared to similarly specced iMacs and MacBook Pros, the pricing is generally reasonable. And this can truly be a pro desktop, with just one exception. Benchmarks The big story to me is how incredibly fast this thing is. Granted, I’m testing the fastest CPU offered, but damn. Geekbench results are very strong. The i7 Mac Mini scored better on single-core performance than every other Mac today (!) at 5912, and its multi-core score of nearly 24,740 beats every Mac to date except the iMac Pro and the old 12-core 2013 Mac Pro. “Performance-competitive with pro Macs” was not high on my prediction list for a Mac Mini update, but here we are. As the rate of CPU advancement has slowed dramatically over the last few years, Apple has found other ways to improve performance. The T2 is great for lots of security reasons — I wouldn’t buy a new Mac these days without it — but what you’re seeing here is its strength as a ridiculously fast SSD controller. This Mac Mini builds my app, Overcast, much faster than my maxed-out 13-inch MacBook Pro, and about as quickly as my 10-core iMac Pro! Obviously, to achieve this result with only 6 cores, it’s not maxing out the CPU 100% of the time — it hits it in bursts while juggling a lot between the SSD and memory — but the result is that it’s incredibly fast as a development machine. The Blackmagick Disk Speed Test shows that the raw SSD performance is effectively identical to the other T2 Macs shipped to date, and a huge improvement over the four-year-old Mac Mini. A lot of people use Mac Minis as media or Plex servers, so I ran an H.265 transcoding test with ffmpeg. This maxes out all CPU cores, so the results predictably scale with the core count: the 6-core Mac Mini was much faster than the 4-core MacBook Pro, but the 10-core iMac Pro beat them both. But if an app supports the T2’s hardware HEVC encoder,3 it can go much faster. And since every T2 so far performs identically, all T2 machines — from the 2018 MacBook Air to the iMac Pro — encode HEVC this way at the same speed, and all in complete silence because they’re barely touching the CPU. I wasn’t able to notice any quality differences between the videos encoded with x265 and the T2’s hardware acceleration. The only spec that lets it down is the Intel GPU. It’s fast enough for common tasks, but if your workload benefits from a strong GPU, you’re better off going for an iMac or a 15-inch MacBook Pro, or considering an eGPU setup. Many Mac lines rely on Intel’s integrated GPUs to fit their physical and thermal needs, and Intel has been incredibly inconsistent over the last few years in delivering updated CPU-GPU combinations that would be suitable for many Macs. We often blame Intel’s CPU roadmap (or Apple’s seeming indifference) for the lack of updates to certain Mac lines, but Intel’s GPU offerings are often the bigger issue. This is Intel’s fault, but it’s Apple’s problem — and Apple passes that problem right along to its customers. But that’s it — aside from price, that’s the only downside. The GPU sucks. Everything else is awesome. If you don’t need a strong GPU — and honestly, most Mac Mini use-cases don’t — this is a solid pick for a general-purpose Mac, even at the base-level configuration. Spec it up, and it’s more like a mini-Mac Pro. A few assorted notes, with apologies for stealing Gruber’s format: It’s silent at idle. The i7’s fan noise does become clearly audible when it’s under heavy load: it’s in the ballpark of a modern MacBook Pro, but quieter. Interestingly, I disabled Turbo Boost to simulate the base i3 model’s thermals, and couldn’t get the fan to spin up audibly, no matter what I did. Those who prioritize silence under heavy loads should probably stick with the i3. This is the first non-iMac desktop Mac that lets you plug in a 5K display, at full quality, without dual cables or other unreliable hacks. We finally have 5K Retina Mac options beyond the iMac! Unfortunately, we still don’t have any great standalone 5K displays. (The LG UltraFine isn’t.) You can upgrade the RAM again! I never would’ve guessed this was coming, and I believe it’s the first time in a long time that an Apple product’s direct successor became more upgradeable and serviceable. I still recommend getting it with the right amount of RAM from Apple if possible, since third-party RAM has historically been a mess of unreliability and finger-pointing, but if you need that, it’s back. (The security screws inside — TR6? — still need some iFixit tools to get past.) I Can’t Believe The Mac Mini Is This Awesome, I Can’t Even Say “Again” Because It Never Was A new Mac Mini could’ve been so much worse. At many times in its past, it has seemed unloved, neglected, and downright punitive — a similar pattern to Apple’s other headless desktop, the Mac Pro. It seemed for a while that Apple lacked any interest in making Macs anymore, especially desktops. Last year, with the introduction of the absolutely stellar iMac Pro, Apple showed us a glimpse of a potential new direction. It was downright perfect — a love letter to the Mac and its pro desktop users, and a clear turnaround in the way the company views the Mac for the better. We didn’t know until now whether the iMac Pro’s greatness was a fluke. But now we have another data point: the last two desktops out of Apple have been incredible. After this, I have faith that they’re going to do the new Mac Pro justice when it finally ships next year. The new Mac Mini is a great update, out of nowhere, to a product we thought would never be updated again. Of course, with Apple’s track record on the Mac Mini, it may never be updated after this. This is either the first in a series of regular updates with which Apple proves that they care about the Mac Mini again, or it’s the last Mac Mini that will ever exist and we’ll all be hoarding them in a few years. We can’t know yet. But today, this is a great update, a wonderful all-arounder for lots of potential needs, and just a fantastic little computer. I do this via iSCSI, but I wouldn’t recommend it. It breaks and requires a new $200+ iSCSI initiator with almost every macOS update — which is why my Mac Mini still runs Sierra. In the near future, I’ll just directly attach some giant external hard drives to the Mac Mini and stop using the NAS. ↩︎ Unless you used optical audio, audio input, or the SD-card reader. (Shit, I use optical in and out.) ↩︎ ffmpeg can do it by specifying -c:v hevc_videotoolbox instead of -c:v x265. I also needed -vtag hvc1 for the output MP4s with either codec to be playable on macOS. Compressor uses the T2’s HEVC acceleration when encoding 8-bit HEVC, but not 10-bit. ↩︎",

If that took you a bit longer than usual to tell the time on the Apple Watch’s new default Infograph face, you’re not alone: John Gruber finds it “far too busy” Jason Snell finds it “pretty and packed with features”, but misses hour numerals Zac Hall removes almost everything to improve legibility David Smith wrote his own complications (!) to improve contrast I’ve configured mine acceptably, but Utility is still far more legible for telling the time at a quick glance: Infograph, Utility Infograph suffers from two major issues: The center complications reduce the contrast between the dial and hands, often making the hands hard to locate. This is avoidable with customization, although the defaults should be much more conservative. It takes too much cognitive effort (and therefore time) to distinguish the current hour. This is simply a flawed design. It’s faster and easier to read analog time with the 1–12 numerals displayed on a watch, but many people prefer the cleaner look of a watch that uses lines, dots, or other shapes as hour markers instead. (Watch people call these “indices”.) And it’s absolutely possible to design a highly legible dial with hour indices in many different styles. Here are some classics and modern takes:1 Across a wide variety of brands, styles, and price points, a few key design principles are clear: The hour markers for 12 (and often 3/6/9) are more prominent. The hour indices are much larger than the minute markings. The hour hands nearly touch the hour indices. These all improve legibility by making it as fast and easy as possible to know which hour is being indicated (and minimize the chance of an off-by-one error), first by orienting your eyes to the current rotation with the 12 marker, then by minimizing the distance between the hour hand and the indices it’s between. Apple Watch’s analog faces all fail to achieve these principles:2 Color, Simple, Explorer Color, Simple, and Explorer have easily distinguished hour markers, but Explorer’s are a bit too far from its hour hand. None of them have distinguished 12 markers to aid in orientation. While Explorer omits minute markings altogether, Simple bafflingly uses 30-second markings in place of its minute track, making time-telling even harder. I’ve never seen another watch with sub-minute markings identical to its minute markings. Activity Analog, Utility, and Infograph without most complications Activity Analog’s hour markers are faint and far from its hour hand, and the central activity rings quickly eliminate the hands’ contrast against the dial as they progress. Utility (when configured without numbers) improves legibility slightly with its bold hour indices, but they’re still too small and too far from its hour hand, and there’s no differentiation for the 12 index. Infograph is similar, but even worse: its hour indices are more faint, it uses 30-second markings instead of minute markings, and its default Calendar display wipes out the top three indices. (At least you can tell which way is up.) Even with almost no complications, the basic essence of the Infograph dial has poor time legibility. When it’s being used as Apple seems to intend, time-telling at a glance is so difficult that many people have actually suggested setting the digital time as the center complication, at which point the hands are just a nuisance and we should stop pretending it’s an analog face. It’s great for Apple to offer a wide variety of Apple Watch faces, but most of them are short-lived novelties at best. We’re three years and four generations into the Apple Watch, and almost every Watch owner I know still uses the same handful of “good” faces. If you want digital time with a good deal of complications, Modular is your only good choice (or Infograph Modular on the Series 4).3 If you want analog time with numerals, Utility is the only good option. If you want indices instead of numerals — probably the most popular analog watch style in the world — I don’t think there is a good option. By now, we’ve seen Apple’s design range that they’re willing to ship as Watch faces, and while it seems broad at first glance, it’s actually pretty narrow. And we’re restricted to the handful of good watch faces that Apple makes, because other developers aren’t allowed to make custom Watch faces. The Apple Watch is an amazing feat of technology. It’s a computer. It can display anything. With no mechanical or physical limitations to hold us back, any watch-face design from anyone could plausibly be built, enabling a range of creativity, style, and usefulness that no single company could ever design on its own. But they won’t let us. In a time when personal expression and innovation in watch fashion should be booming, they’re instead being eroded, as everyone in the room is increasingly wearing the same watch with the same two faces. Open this door, Apple. You can even see which model the Apple Watch’s hand shape comes from, which is not a coincidence. ↩︎ For Apple Watch faces offering multiple hour/minute styles, I selected the best one that didn’t have hour numerals, and most complications were disabled. ↩︎ Special shout-out to my favorite digital face, Solar. ↩︎",

Busy day. It all started with the watchOS volume widget. You see, Overcast’s previous Apple Watch app really sucked. I did my best with the capabilities of watchOS 1–4, but I couldn’t give people what they really wanted: Standalone podcast playback on the Apple Watch without an iPhone. I briefly offered it through some bad hacks, but had to remove it. Volume control on the Watch, which is increasingly important with the popularity of AirPods. That’s why I nearly jumped for joy during the watchOS 5 announcement in June, when Apple unveiled most of my list of watchOS changes needed to make good podcast apps. After a very busy summer, standalone Apple Watch playback is back in Overcast, and it’s actually good this time! It’s not perfect: No cellular. Apple hasn’t released a good way to do cellular audio streaming in watchOS, and the bad ways wouldn’t be very useful. Sending podcasts to the Watch is slow. Overcast shrinks them to reduce the transfer time, but when (and how quickly) podcasts transfer is tightly controlled by watchOS to preserve battery life. Transfers still sometimes wait forever or silently fail. Programmers like me can’t accept that something is just slow, so I’ve decided to make transfer speed irrelevant. Nobody cares how slowly podcasts transfer if it happens while they’re asleep! Auto-Sync to Watch automatically tries to send your most recent podcasts to your Apple Watch whenever it gets a chance.1 You can still send episodes manually from the queue button on an episode (≡+), but in my testing, I never needed to. Just pick up your Watch and go, and it’ll already have plenty of podcasts for your outing, all without having to manually sync anything or wait for slow transfers. The Overcast 5.0.1 update, due out in a few days, makes Watch transfers even more reliable. (Sorry. Found a better way after 5.0 was approved.) And Watch-crown volume control! Finally, the best way to use Overcast from your Apple Watch isn’t to delete it, letting the Now Playing app show up instead. That’s where the other half of my summer workload began. The watchOS volume widget offers minimal customization: just the color of the circle. I couldn’t make the line width a little narrower to match the rest of Overcast’s thin-line aesthetic. But that iOS 7-era thin-line aesthetic looked dated, and I’d wanted a design refresh for a while. I decided to start modernizing the app’s design, screen by screen. I couldn’t do it all in one summer, so I started with the screen that needed the most help: Now Playing. The previous Now Playing screen in Overcast 4. The biggest problem of the previous design was the center artwork area, a scrollable set of “pages” that had speed and effects controls offscreen to the left, and the episode notes offscreen to the right. Nobody ever found them. I’ve been getting emails almost every day from people asking where the speed controls were because they set them once and couldn’t find them again, or saying how they’d really like my app more if it offered speed controls. The only indication in the interface was three “page dots” below the scrollable area, but that wasn’t enough. The new design maintains the same scrollable pages, but now as obvious, tactile cards. In my testing, everyone figured these out immediately. Put differently, it’s like you’re navigating this through a phone-shaped window in the middle: This design is not only more discoverable, but it allows me to fit more controls on screen, and in more reachable areas. Unlike the previous design, I can also fit the same controls on all devices, from the iPhone SE to the iPad Pro. Designing a good Now Playing screen for a music or podcast app that’s nice, clean, and highly discoverable is incredibly difficult. I think I’ve finally found a good balance. I’ve given chapters (when present) their own card with durations and inline progress bars. I’ve also finally revamped the sleep timer to ditch the ugly alert sheet, give it a proper UI for fast input, and show the remaining time in more useful ways: There are lots of other improvements throughout the app as well. Some of the highlights: Search your podcasts and current episodes from the main screen, or go into a podcast’s screen to search its entire archive. Refreshed the podcast screen a little. (More to come.) Siri Shortcuts support, of course. Plus smaller fixes and improvements: CarPlay performance is much better, especially for people with large collections. Podcasts now display their estimated release frequency (daily, weekly, etc.) if it can be inferred. Tap-to-load on images now loads all images from the same domain at once. Tons of bug fixes and performance improvements. Overcast 5 requires iOS 12 and watchOS 5, and as always, it’s free. Update your devices, then go get Overcast! Up to 20 episodes are auto-synced today. This number will change as I refine the balance of resource usage. Auto-Sync to Watch is on by default and can be turned off in Nitpicky Details. ↩︎",

    "title": "Low Power Mode on the Mac",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2018/07/31/mac-low-power-mode",
    "description": "Laptop battery life is decreasingly relevant to me as more airplanes offer power outlets. But sometimes you lose that lottery, as I did on my latest 8-hour daytime flight. Apple’s “Up to 10 hours” claim doesn’t apply to my work,1 which is usually a mix of Xcode, web browsing, and social time-wasting, so I knew I’d have to seriously conserve power. Sometimes, you just need Low Power Mode: the switch added to iOS a few years ago to conserve battery life when you need it, at the expense of full performance and background tasks. There’s no such feature on Mac laptops, but there should be. It could: Disable the discrete GPU on 15-inch models unless required for hardware reasons2 Pause Photos syncing and analysis Pause Spotlight indexing Reduce the frequency of Time Machine backups Don’t download or install software updates Don’t download new content in iTunes Auto-dim the screen after a shorter time Let third-party apps detect Low Power Mode and reduce their background operations to only essential work And the big one: Reduce the processor’s maximum wattage or disable Turbo Boost Back in 2015, I experimented with disabling Turbo Boost and discovered that it reduced performance by about a third, but also boosted battery life by almost as much. Since then, I’ve been running Turbo Boost Switcher Pro to automatically disable Turbo Boost when I’m running on battery power, and it has been wonderful: I made it through that 8-hour flight only because Turbo Boost was off. Over the last few days, I’ve run battery tests on my 2018 13-inch MacBook Pro with the (awesome) 2.7 GHz i7 and my 2015 2.2 GHz 15-inch3 to see how far I could push the battery life using Volta, which can disable Turbo Boost and/or set wattage limits on the CPU. My test was based on the “Heavy” script from last time, but using xcodebuild every few minutes with Overcast’s current codebase (which is larger and includes some Swift). Improvements are in green and performance reductions are in red: \u003c!-- .turboboosttable { margin: 2em auto; border-collapse: collapse; } .turboboosttable th, .turboboosttable td { text-align: center; border: 1px solid #f4f4f4; padding: 0.5em; } .turboboosttable th { width: 15%; } .turboboosttable th.lcol { text-align: right; } .turboboosttable th.notbold { font-weight: normal; } .turboboosttable th { background-color: #f4f4f4; } .turboboosttable .lightslash { opacity: 0.33; } .turboboosttable td.noturbo { background-color: #f8f8f8; } .turboboosttable .perfminus { color: #a00; } .turboboosttable .perfplus { color: #0a0; } --\u003e 15-inch 2015 MacBook Pro (2.2 GHz quad-core i7)   Battery life Geekbench single/multi xcodebuild Normal 3:36 3963/13864 43.9s No Turbo 5:06+42% 2796/9917−29/28% 63.4s+44% 13-inch 2018 MacBook Pro (2.7 GHz quad-core i7)   Battery life Geekbench single/multi xcodebuild Normal 3:09 5412/18983 34.3s 28W 3:28+10% 5401/16326−0/14% 37.4s+9% 18W 4:05+29% 5248/14133−3/26% 43.5s+27% 12W 4:44+50% 4818/11835−11/38% 48.2s+41% No Turbo 5:05+61% 3624/13324−33/30% 48.9s+43% 6W 6:24+103% 4065/7596−25/60% 76.1s+121% It’s impressive how much faster this new 13-inch model is than the best laptop ever made due to significant CPU and SSD improvements. Dropping the wattage to 6W, the thermal limit of the fanless 12-inch MacBook, interestingly (but not surprisingly) makes it perform effectively identically to the best 12-inch MacBook in Geekbench. This is an extreme option, but one I’d occasionally take if offered. It roughly doubles compilation times, but also doubles the battery life. This ratio holds for most other configurations: the gain in battery life is about as large as the loss in heavy-workload performance. That’s a trade-off I’d gladly make when I need to maximize runtime. The best bang-for-the-buck option is still to just disable Turbo Boost. Single-threaded performance hurts more than with wattage-limiting, but it’s able to maintain better multi-threaded performance and more consistent thermals, and gets a larger battery gain relative to its performance loss. And Volta, which offers both wattage limits and Turbo disabling, requires disabling System Integrity Protection to install an unsigned kernel extension, which I really don’t recommend. Turbo Boost Switcher, which doesn’t offer wattage control, works with SIP using a signed extension and its Pro version has more convenient features for automatic toggling. For now, I’m going to continue to happily run Turbo Boost Switcher Pro to selectively give myself better battery life, and I recommend it for anyone else with the same need. But what I ultimately want is for a true Low Power Mode built into macOS that could provide this sort of CPU throttling and software changes, which would ultimately achieve even greater gains. Whose work does get 10 hours out of a MacBook Pro? None of the use-cases on the marketing page — Photography, Coding, Video Editing, 3D Graphics, and Gaming — are likely to achieve even half of that in practice. ↩︎ I’ve heard that 15-inch models are wired such that the discrete GPU is required when external displays are connected. Otherwise, whether it’s used or not is a software decision, and gfxCardStatus can override it in certain conditions. ↩︎ It’s not brand new, so it’s not a perfect comparison, but the battery only had 90 cycles before this test. ↩︎",

    "title": "Overcast 4.2: The privacy update",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2018/04/27/overcast42",
    "description": "Overcast 4.2 is out now. It enhances privacy in two major areas: Anonymous sync by default Overcast has offered anonymous sync accounts since 2014. They’re fully functional, but they lack email addresses or passwords, so they can’t log into the website. A login token is stored in iCloud so the account can be accessed after a restore or upgrade, or from other devices you own. Previously, the login screen pushed email logins. But with four years of perspective, feedback, and usage data, I now think that’s the wrong move. Only a single-digit percentage of customers use the website, and the iCloud token-sync method solves cross-device logins for almost everyone. Your personal data isn’t my business — it’s a liability. I want as little as possible. I don’t even log IP addresses anymore. If I don’t need your email address, I really don’t want it. 68% of Overcast accounts have email addresses today. To reduce that as much as possible, I’ve made major changes to account handling: The previous login screen (left) and the new one. In Overcast 4.2, the login screen now prominently encourages anonymous accounts by default. If you already have an account in iCloud, it’ll pop up a dialog box over this screen asking if you want to use it. And the first time you launch 4.2, people with email-based accounts will be encouraged to migrate them to anonymous accounts: The migration prompt that shows on the first run. Finally, you can now change your account between email-based and anonymous whenever you want. Blocking ad-tracking images In most podcast apps, podcasts are downloaded automatically in the background. The only data sent to a podcast’s publisher about you or your behavior is your IP address and the app’s name. The IP address lets them derive your approximate region, but not much else. They don’t know exactly who you are, whether you listened, when you listened, how far you listened, or whether you skipped certain parts. Some large podcast producers are trying very hard to change that. I’m not. Big data ruined the web, and I’m not going to help bring it to podcasts. Publishers already get enough from Apple to inform ad rates and make content decisions — they don’t need more data from my customers. Podcasting has thrived, grown, and made tons of money for tons of people under the current model for over a decade. We already have all the data we need. One of the ways publishers try to get around the limitations of the current model is by embedding remote images or invisible “tracking pixels” in each episode’s HTML show notes. When displayed in most apps, the images are automatically loaded from an analytics server, which can then record and track more information about you. In Overcast 4.2, much like Mail (and for the same reason), remote images don’t load by default. A tappable placeholder shows you where each image will load from, and you can decide whether to load it or not. I believe I’ve done this in the most secure way possible — I’m actually displaying the show notes using a strict Content Security Policy — and I would love to hear from anyone who finds a way to inject auto-loading remote images or execute arbitrary JavaScript in show notes. Bug fixes Overcast 4.2 also includes a bunch of minor fixes, and two big ones: Fixed the major slowdowns and high battery usage that resulted from extremely large podcast artwork. Password-protected episodes are now supported on password-protected feeds. Get it now in the App Store!",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2018/03/13/overcast41",
    "description": "Overcast 4.1 is now in the App Store with some small but nice new features. Smart Resume is actually two features: It jumps back by up to a few seconds after having been paused to help remind you of the conversation. It slightly adjusts resumes and seeks to fall in the silences between spoken words when reasonably possible. Both are subtle but noticeable benefits (my favorite kind), especially when you’re being interrupted a lot, such as while following turn-by-turn navigation directions. Smart Resume is on by default, and can be turned off in Nitpicky Details. Delete episodes 24 hours after completion: Before, episodes could either be auto-deleted immediately upon completion, or not at all. There’s now a third option, auto-deleting 24 hours after completion, which will soon be the default for new accounts. The 24-hour threshold is only enforced after a successful sync, so it won’t auto-delete anything in the middle of an extended offline period, such as a long flight. Auto-deletion, either immediate or after 24 hours, also no longer applies to Premium subscribers’ Uploads. Password-protected podcasts: Some private podcast feeds, including many paid and members-only podcasts, require a username and password via HTTP Basic Auth. You can now add these in the Add URL screen. Password-protected podcasts, and other private feeds such as Patreon bonus feeds and anything using the tag, do not show up in search or recommendations. Noteworthy bug fixes: Resuming playback after quitting in the background, especially on very long podcasts and/or when using AirPods, no longer occasionally results in glitchy noises and incorrect durations. Playback under certain conditions no longer stalls, requiring pausing and playing again. Downloads now fail less often. Playback controls no longer disappear occasionally. Smart Speed total savings now appear at the bottom of the Settings screen for locales that use commas as their decimal separator.1 Extremely large playlists now only show the most/least-recent 500 episodes to improve app performance for users with very high subscription counts. There’s also one removal: rotation support on iPhone. (The iPad app still rotates.) iPhone rotation has always been disabled by default, and had been buried in Nitpicky Details for a long time, so very few people have ever used it. Meanwhile, it has become increasingly difficult to support and maintain, especially with the modern complexities of rotation and the dramatically increased workload of supporting the iPhone X in landscape. iPhone rotation has simply proven far too costly to maintain for its extremely low usage, and it had to go to free up more of my time for more highly demanded features. I apologize to the few people who did use it, and I hope this isn’t too disruptive for you. The rest is all good news. Go get Overcast now! In the next update, I’ll be addressing the biggest design failure of Overcast 4: the non-discoverability of the Effects and Notes pages in the Now Playing screen. Expect the return of an ancient user-interface tool known as “buttons”. This was Overcast’s oldest known bug, which had been there since 1.0: some users, mostly in central Europe, wouldn’t see Smart Speed totals. It turned out to be one of the most interesting and obscure bugs I’ve seen. The total-time-saved value is stored on-device as it accumulates, then gets sent to the server to be combined with any listening you do on other devices. The overall total is read back from the server, and the local total is reset, on each sync. I was using an NSNumberFormatter to read the total value from Overcast’s server as a double. My server always sends values with U.S.-style number formatting, using a period as the decimal separator (e.g. “1234.5”). But by default, NSNumberFormatter uses the device’s locale, so in countries that use a comma as the decimal separator (e.g. “1234,5”), it was interpreting the server’s numbers with periods as invalid and returning zero. So the Settings screen thought they hadn’t saved any time, and hid the time-saved label. Fortunately, it was an easy fix: setting that NSNumberFormatter locale to en_US to match what the server was sending. And since the accumulated local totals were still being sent and added properly, the correct historical data is there — it just wasn’t being displayed correctly. ↩︎",
