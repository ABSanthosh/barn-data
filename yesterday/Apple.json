    "description": "AirPods 4 are the best pound-for-pound product in Apple’s portfolio. These open-ear buds sound good and pack tremendous tech and software features into a ridiculously diminutive package. But it’s more than just that; AirPods are also a resilient piece of tech and stand up well under the rigors of day-to-day usage. Watch our hands-on AirPods 4 review as we discuss its top features, settings, and more. more…",

    "link": "https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/04/hands-on-with-midnight-airpods-max-with-usb-c/",
    "description": "Say what you will about AirPods Max falling behind AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4 in terms of software features, but the sonic performance of Apple’s wireless over-ear headphones remains unmatched. As much as I adore AirPods Pro 2 for their peak earbud performance and ability to go anywhere, AirPods Max always impress me when I want to hear every detail of every instrument in a song. Apple revised the hardware for the first time ever in September, replacing Lightning charging with USB-C and introducing new colors. Short of some wireless charging option, USB-C and an update from space gray to midnight topped my request list. For that reason, I turned my space gray AirPods Max with Lightning into cash and paid the difference for . Midnight is closer to black than space gray was, and the hint of blue satisfies my temptation to go for a more colorful option instead. USB-C means the same cable to powers up my iPhone and iPad now can recharge AirPods Max. The Apple TV remote and Mac keyboard and mice still use Lightning, but those need charging weekly or monthly instead of every few days. Otherwise, these are the same AirPods Max I’ve raved about since 2020. Someone else got a good deal on my old Lightning AirPods Max, and I got a cool new color and a convenience I’ll appreciate until AirPods Max 2 someday exist. For folks buying AirPods Max for the first time now, you’ll never have to wonder why they use a different charging port than new iPhones, and they sound exceptional. Anyway, read on for some hands-on shots of the new midnight finish. more…",

    "link": "https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/deals-apple-pencil-macbook-air/",
    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Macworld Apple’s Studio Display was released along with the Mac Studio in March 2022. While it’s seen as a display for that Mac, the Studio Display can work with any Mac. It’s a lot more affordable than Apple’s Pro Display XDR, and it’s really the only 27-inch 5K display on the market. If you’re in the market for a Studio Display, we can help you find a good deal. Our price trackers below show several retailers who are selling the Studio Display and the prices. Use these trackers to get the best deal. We also have the information you need to know about the Studio Display, in case you’re still trying to decide if it’s the monitor for you. Here’s everything you need to know about buying the new Studio Display. How much does the Apple Studio Display cost? The regular price for the Studio Display depends on two things: the type of glass and the type of stand. Here are the prices of each Studio Display configuration. ProductFront glassStand typePriceApple Studio Displaystandardtilt-only adjustable$1,599/£1,499Apple Studio DisplaystandardVESA wall mount adapter$1,599/£1,499Apple Studio Displaystandardtilt and height-adjustable$1,999/£1,899Apple Studio Displaynano-texturetilt-only adjustable$1,899/£1,749Apple Studio Displaynano-textureVESA wall mount adapter$1,899/£1,749Apple Studio Displaynano-texturetilt and height-adjustable$2,299/£2,149 In the box, you’ll get a 1-meter Thunderbolt cable, and the nano-texture displays include Apple’s Polishing Cloth. The power cable is attached to the monitor. The Studio Display is designed to work with the new Mac Studio, but it can work with other Macs.

Best deals on the Apple Studio Display It’s rare to find deals on Apple displays, so if you’re shopping specifically for an Apple display and a deal pops up, it’s time to take advantage. Amazon U.S. is currently offering a few deals on the Apple Studio Display. You can save $150 or $300 dollars, which is significant when you consider that these displays almost never go on sale. Here are links to the deals: U.S.: Amazon, Apple Studio Display, $1,349 ($250 off, MSRP $1,599) ​​​​​​​In the U.K. Currys, Apple Studio Display 27-inch 5K Standard Glass: £1,469 (£30 off) New Refurbished Retailer Price $1,349 View Deal $1599 View Deal $1599 View Deal $1599 View Deal $1599.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price Apple 27-inch Monitor 5120 x 1440 LED (MK0U3LL/A) $1449 View Deal Price comparison from Backmarket What else will I need to buy? Potentially, nothing. The Studio Display has three USB-C ports in the back and one Thunderbolt, so it can easily be connected to your existing accessories. While you will find Apple’s A13 Bionic chip under the hood of the Studio Display, this is mainly used for the audio and video features. There’s also no RAM, storage or operating system built-in, even if it’s designed to work with macOS. You can technically use the display with any PC or laptop. What are the glass options? The front of the Studio Display is covered in glass, and Apple offers two kinds: Standard and Nano-texture. The Nano-texture glass is a lot less reflective than the Standard glass. If you’re sensitive to glare, or you do production work where lighting is critical, opt for the Nano-texture–but this option adds to the price of the display. What are the stand options? Apple offers three types of stands for the Studio Display: Tilt-adjustable stand: Allows for only the adjustment of the display’s tilt. This comes standard with the Studio Display. Tilt- and height-adjustable stand: Can adjust the tilt and height. This stand costs extra. VESA mount adapter: Used to attach to a VESA-compatible arm, wall mount, or stand. Comes at no additional cost. Deals for the best monitors and displays for Mac These displays and monitors are featured in our test of the best monitors for Mac.

    "description": "Macworld Apple last updated the Mac Studio in June 2023. The Mac Studio comes with either a M2 Max or M2 Ultra chip. In our review of the M2 Max Mac Studio we were impressed by its processing power, port flexibility, and design. There are some deals on the M2-generation Mac Studio in the U.K., but in the U.S. the only place to save money on a Mac Studio is at Apple’s Refurbished Store. If you want to buy a Mac Studio, and get the best deal possible, you’ve come to the right place. We’re looking at where you can buy the Mac Studio at the best price. Best Mac Studio deals There are no deals on new Mac Studio models in the U.S. right now, but there are discounts in the U.K.: AO, Mac Studio M2 Max: £1,906 (£193 off, MSRP £2,099) The best way to save money on a Mac Studio is to buy one from the Apple Refurbished Store. Save up to $600 on a refurbished Mac Studio at Apple Refurbished Store in the U.S. Save up to £630 on a refurbished Mac Studio at Apple Refurbished Store in the U.K. What you need to know In March 2022 Apple introduced its most powerful Mac yet, and then, in June 2023 it updated it with M2 Max and M2 Ultra chips. At the same time, Apple also introduced an Mac Pro with the same specs (the M2 Max and M2 Ultra), but that model has some other features the Mac Studio lacks and a higher price. The Mac Studio can be configured with a M2 Max chip, as seen in the 14in and 16in MacBook Pro, or you can choose an M2 Ultra, which is essentially two M2 Max chips. Read about how the M2 Pro Mac mini compares to the Mac Studio. The Mac Studio starts at $1,999/£2,099 for the M2 Max model. The Mac Studio with M2 Ultra starts at $3,999/£4,199. There are also various build-to-order options. Note that the prices for the previous generation were lower, as you can see below. The most obvious thing missing from the Mac Studio is a display, but if you want to buy Apple’s Studio Display we have a separate article explaining where you can get the best deal on an Apple Studio Display.

    "description": "Macworld Finally, 30 months after Apple announced the 24-inch iMac in a collection of seven different colors and powered by Apple’s M1 Chip in April 2021, Apple has updated the iMac with an M3 chip. The 2023 iMac, which was announced in October 2023 and went on sale in November, is a leap up from the 2021 iMac, although not much else has changed. Read about the 2023 iMac and our review of the 2023 M3 iMac. Apple discontinued the 27-inch iMac in March 2022, but it is rumored that a new iMac Pro could be in the pipeline. If that is the Mac you are interested in you may be in for a long wait though, with the larger iMac not expected until late 2024 or 2025. Alternatively, you may be interested in Apple’s high-power desktop, the Mac Studio, see our Best Mac Studio deals. The Mac mini with M2 Pro is another good option, see Best Mac mini deals. With the arrival of the M3 iMac the M1 iMac will no longer be sold by Apple, but you may find those older models available at a discount from resellers while they try to sell off old stock. Note that while the prices remain the same, the M1 iMac did have a price increase outside the U.S. a year after launch, so the savings may not be as good as they appear to be. Not that you need to pay full price. The team here at Macworld is constantly looking out for the best iMac deals from around the web. We track the biggest and best deals from U.S. and U.K. retailers and list them all right here in this article. So you can always find the best price for an iMac.

US or at Apple UK, but there are plenty of stores and Apple Premium Resellers around the world that offer discounts on new and old Macs. Some Mac retailers offer great discounts on Apple products and Apple accessories, so you should be able to save a few hundred pounds off some iMac configurations. Beware, though. The Mac listed by the reseller may be an older model than the one Apple currently sells. We’ve seen resellers advertising Macs with money off based on the price they were previously sold at by Apple, even after Apple has started selling a newer Mac at the same price – so the deal often looks better than it actually is. So be careful to check the age and spec of the machine being sold, and don’t automatically assume that it’s current. To get an idea of what the old model should be worth, take a look at Apple’s refurbished store to see what Apple is selling the older version for (and remember that buying from Apple, even if it’s refurbished, will mean you get a full year’s warranty). And for another way to save money on a new Apple product read about how you can trade in old products at Apple and other resellers and get money off. Read: How Apple trade-in works and saves you money. We regularly see Mac-related deals from the following U.K. and U.S. retailers: U.S. Want to buy a iMac from Apple?

Best refurbished iMac deals One of the best places to look for iMac deals all year round is the Apple Refurbished Store. There, you’ll find huge iMac discounts, sometimes even on the latest models. These iMacs have been returned to Apple for various reasons, and then completely revamped for resale. One of the major benefits of buying a refurbished Mac from Apple is that it will come with a one-year warranty so Apple may fix or replace it for free should anything happen to it in that first year. You won’t be able to tell the difference between a refurbished iMac and a brand-new iMac, aside from the box it comes in, which is white to prevent people from buying them and attempting to sell them as new.

    "description": "Macworld There are good laptops, and then there’s the new MacBook Pro, which is a superb combination of price and performance. We have some issues with the entry level model’s price, but this deal makes it wasy to recommend: The 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro is $300 off at Amazon, making it available for purchase for a palatable $1,299, the same price as the 13-inch model it replaced. This laptop features a powerful M3 chip with an 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU, easily sustaining any task you have to perform, either for fun or for work, and the screen is a 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display with an amazing 500nits of brightness, ensuring you can use it anywhere you go. In our review of the M3 MacBook Pro, our expert gave it a 4-star rating, praising the device’s powerful performance, as well as the excellent display and speakers. “The audio quality from the six-speaker sound system with force-canceling woofers leaves nothing to be desired–external speakers are superfluous. It’s another big improvement over the stereo speakers in the 13-inch MacBook Pro,” we noted. Basically, you can rely on the built-in speakers for Zoom calls or music while you work. The M3 MacBook Pro also promises a fantastic battery life of more than 20 hours on a single charge. That’s more than enough to get through a workday (and some overtime) without missing your charger. It’s time to save $300 and get yourself an amazing laptop, as the MacBook Pro is down to $1,299 at Amazon right now. The MacBook Pro M3 has a great priceBuy it now at Amazon",

    "description": "Macworld Apple announced new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max chips at an event on October 30. The upgraded MacBook Pro models arrived less than a year after Apple launched the M2 Pro and M2 Max variants of the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro (in January 2023). The late-2023 MacBook Pro update also marks the demise of the 13-inch MacBook Pro, which has been replaced by a 14-inch model with the standard M3 chip, unfortunately at a higher price than the discontinued model. If you want to buy a MacBook Pro you will be able to save money if you choose one of the M2-series models, which will now be discounted by resellers as they sell off the discontinued stock. However, you should keep in mind that, with a mixture of price rises and declines across the range in comparison to the previous generation, it could be hard to spot a really good deal. Luckily we are here to help.

    "description": "Macworld Now that the iPhone 16 launch is in our rearview mirror, we can start looking at the models coming in 2025. And first up is what is shaping up to be a very exciting update to the cheapest iPhone–it could include a major new component Apple has been working on for more than five years. According to 9to5Mac, the 4th-gen iPhone SE will feature Apple’s first homegrown 5G modem, codenamed Centauri. The report claims the chip will also handle Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS and will be the first iPhone modem that isn’t made by Qualcomm. Apple has had plans to release its own 5G modem since at least 2019, when it purchased Intel’s smartphone modem division, including some 2,200 employees as well as intellectual property, equipment, and leases. A switch to its own modem could be a game-changer for Apple. As well as the obvious cost savings, the 5G modem plays one of the biggest roles in battery life and efficiency, and control over the development could dramatically increase battery efficiency. The modem will likely only connect to the sub-6GHz networks like the current iPhone SE. The iPhone 16 models in the U.S. also connect to higher-speed mmWave networks for faster Wi-FI-like speeds, so if Apple uses its own modem in those phones, it will likely support that technology. Most rumors claim that probably wouldn’t happen until the iPhone 18. Elsewhere in the report, 9to5Mac’s source claims the iPhone SE will have the same A18 processor and 48MP wide camera as the iPhone 16, though won’t have a second ultrawide camera. As previously reported, it will have a design similar to the iPhone 14, with a notch for Face ID and a 6.1-inch OLED display. Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone SE 4 in spring 2025.

    "description": "Macworld Wireless headphones or earbuds (whatever you call them) are essentially the standard now, with Bluetooth earbuds being convenient and the sound quality difference to wired not being that noticeable to typical people (we realize audiophiles ‘know’). The market is huge, but here are the best wireless earbuds we’ve tested for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Macs. If you do want a wired connection some of these do offer it in addition to Bluetooth, but we also have a round-up of the best wired headphones and a comparison of over-ear headphones read our comparison of AirPods Max vs other over-ear headphones. Updated October 2024 with Apple’s new AirPods 4 and AirPods 4 with ANC. Best headphones and earbuds for iPhone 1. Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Pros Excellent sound quality Impressive noise-cancellation Useful app Cons Expensive Wireless case costs extra Spatial audio could be improved Price When Reviewed: $299.99 Best Prices Today: $249.99 at Target $299 at Amazon$299 at B\u0026H They’re not the cheapest earbuds around, but Bose’s QuietComfort range has long been a market leader thanks to its combination of high-quality sound and impressively effective noise cancellation. The recently released QC Ultra continues that trend, but introduces an improved design as well as a new immersive mode for spatial audio. The design of the Ultra is a little sleeker and more streamlined than previous models, with a smart metallic finish that is available in black or Smoke White. Bose has also modified the way that its rubber stability bands fit into each earpiece, helping them to sit inside your ear more securely. You get three sets of stability bands, and three sets of rubber eartips in different sizes, so the combination of the different bands and eartips should allow most people to get a good fit. The Bose app also includes a Seal Test option that can check the way that the earbuds are fitted and provide tips on getting a good fit. Sound quality is as good as ever, with the Ultra catching the sharp, shimmering sound of the cymbal crash that kicks off Blondie’s Rapture. The bass guitar riff bounces along like a playful puppy, and there’s a bright jangling sound to the lead rhythm guitar, but the Ultra has a keen ear and also picks out the quiet chugging guitar riff that hides further back in the mix. The immersive audio isn’t entirely convincing, but it does add a little extra reverb and spacey ambiance to more atmospheric tracks such as Cut by Low. And, of course, Bose’s noise cancelation is still ahead of the pack. It stamps down on the deep rumble of aircraft engine noise so effectively that I have to check the settings on my office iMac to make sure the audio file is still playing. The higher frequencies in our airport noise test are more challenging for most headphones, but the Ultra works well here too, leaving only a slight murmur of sound lingering way off in the background. Battery life is around six hours when using noise-cancellation, but spatial audio reduces that to just four hours. The charging case does provide three additional charges, though, and our only real complaint is that the standard USB-C case doesn’t provide wireless charging as well, so you’ll have to pay $49/£49.95 extra for the optional wireless case. 2. Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 Pros Excellent sound quality Supports Bluetooth 5.4 Very good noise cancellation IP54 rating for outdoor use Cons Higher price Slightly chunky design Apple users don’t need aptX Price When Reviewed: $299.95 Best Prices Today: $199.95 at Amazon$216.99 at Best Buy$219.95 at B\u0026H I’ve always been a fan of Sennheiser’s headphones, so I was a bit worried when the company was taken over a couple of years ago by Sonova – a medical company that makes hearing aids. I needn’t have worried, though, as Sennheiser has been on a roll lately, launching new products on an almost monthly basis. Its latest update is the Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds, which, as the name suggests, is the fourth-gen version of this popular range of Bluetooth earbuds (and not to be confused with the larger Momentum 4 over-ear headphones). The TW4 is quite a big update too – as it should be, given that the price has increased from $249.99/£219.99. It’s one of the first sets of headphones we’ve seen that supports the latest Bluetooth 5.4, which includes new features such as Auracast, which is a kind of public announcement system based on Bluetooth. Auracast isn’t widely used yet – most Apple devices are still on Bluetooth 5.3 – but it can be used in public places such as airports or gyms to transmit music or audio announcements to lots of people all at once, so it will be an important accessibility feature in the future. Additional Bluetooth features include support for the latest high-quality aptX Lossless, and the new LC3 codec. Sadly, Apple still doesn’t support aptX, but – like previous models – the TW4 also includes the AAC codec for Apple devices too. Other improvements include a sturdy IP54 rating for water and dust resistance. And, along with four sets of ear-tips in different sizes, the TW4 also includes three sets of rubber fins, which fit into the outer ear and help to hold the earpieces in place, so the TW4 will be a good option for outdoor use and exercise. Battery life gets a small boost too, now lasting for seven hours when using noise-cancellation, and you can use the wireless charging case to fully recharge three more times as well. And, as always, the Momentum earbuds sound really great. They handle the sonic mash-up of Sturgill Simpson’s Sing Along with ease, finding room to pick out the taut, ticking percussion, fuzz-laden guitars and fizzing electronic keyboards so that you can hear each set of instruments clearly. You can hear the country drawl in Simpson’s voice as he snarls – “carve my name in the barstool baby – I’m gonna be here a while” – and the swooping bass drop that follows is guaranteed to get you dancing. Even the noise-cancellation seems to have improved on this model, and comes close to matching noise-cancellation leaders such as the AirPods Pro and Bose QC Ultra. 3. Apple AirPods Pro 2nd-generation (2023) Pros Fantastic audio quality Excellent noise canceling Best-in-class transparency mode New charging case features Better battery life Cons You can still buy better-sounding wireless earbuds No LE Audio, lossless, or hi-res audio Controls on the stems is still a bad idea Price When Reviewed: $249 Best Prices Today: $157.95 at B\u0026H$249 at Apple$297.50 at Amazon In September 2024 Apple announced that the AirPods Pro 2 will soon get the new hearing aid support. There are a few minor external changes for the second-generation Apple AirPods Pro, but most of the changes are on the inside. The 2022 model comes with four sets of eartips adding extra small (XS) to the mix – the original AirPods Pro only came with three tips. We found the extra small tips more comfortable, your experience may differ. The charging case now comes with a small metal lanyard loop – although Apple doesn’t actually sell a lanyard. There are speaker holes a the base of the case that can make a sound if you lose the AirPods while they are in their case. The original AirPods Pro lacked an easy way to control volume, so the fact that the second-gen model adds the ability to detect up and down swipes on the little flat area of the stem is useful. A swipe up or down changes the volume. As for what’s inside, the H2 chip in the 2022 AirPods Pro enables Adaptive Transparency, which is an enhancement of the Transparency mode on the original model. As a result of this mode you can choose to hear things that you might need be able to hear in your vicinity, but you won’t be deafened by them. In our tests the AirPods Pro 2 blocked more outside sound than the originals. We were impressed by how much better the new second-generation AirPods Pro sound compared to the first generation. Clarity and sharpness is improved and bass response is vastly improved. The bridge of the Beastie Boys’ “Intergalactic” at 2:30 was just way too much for the old AirPods Pro to handle, but the new model had no trouble keeping up. The battery life is longer than it was for the original AirPods Pro and you can now use your Apple Watch charger in addition to charging via Lightning and other wireless charging methods. As with the iPhone 14-series and the 2022 Apple Watches, Bluetooth 5.3 is supported, however, it doesn’t appear that it’s being used for anything in particular right now. Perhaps a software update will bring new features in the future. Like the originals the AirPods Pro 2 offer Spatial Audio with head tracking, Conversation Boost to amplify speech in the direction you’re facing, one-tap pairing, audio sharing with another pair of AirPods (or Beats), quick switching to other Apple devices your Apple ID is logged into, and hands-free Siri. Read our full AirPods Pro 2 USB-C review 4. Beats Studio Buds+ Pros Fun transparent design (other colors are available) Improved ANC and sound quality Good battery life Priced well Cons Don’t sound as good as AirPods Pro Missing a few Apple ecosystem features No wireless charging Price When Reviewed: $169.99 Best Prices Today: $129.95 at Walmart$129.99 at Target $169.95 at Adorama We felt that the original Beats Studio Buds outclassed AirPods Pro in several ways but lacked some Apple-specific features. 2023’s new Beats Studio Buds + improve on the originals. The Beats Studio Buds + beats Apple in terms of color choices with its retro frosted transparent plastic for both the buds and case. They are available in black and ivory too. The charging case is a bit larger than that of AirPods or AirPods Pro. There’s a USB-C charge port, but no wireless charging. The buds are average in size and fit and come with four sizes of eartips, so it’s easy to get a good seal, although in our testing we did lose the seal a couple of times while working out at the gym. There are actual physical buttons on the side of each earbud, which we found to be easier to use than Apple’s “squeeze the stem” AirPods control system. Beats says that these earbuds offer 1.6x better noise canceling and 2x better transparency than their predecessors. They still don’t match the AirPods Pro, but they are priced closer to the standard AirPods, which don’t even offer those features. The transparency feature isn’t adaptive. These second-gen earbuds offer improved ventilation and bigger batteries than the predecessors (battery life is rated at six hours with ANC, or nine without). Sound quality is also better than that of the previous generation thanks to new microphones and transducers. They sound better than 3rd-gen AirPods, but the 2nd-gen AirPods Pro deliver an overall superior audio experience all around. Some Beats products use Apple’s own headphone chips, but the Beats Studio Buds + do not. Because they lack Apple’s H1 or H2 chip, they miss out on many of the features of Apple’s ecosystem. Hands-free “Hey Siri” is there, as is instant pairing with your iPhone and support for the Find My app. But you don’t get instant switching between Apple devices, support for spatial audio with video, personalized spatial audio, Conversation Boost, or the in-ear detection that pauses playback if you take an earbud out. Instead, these buds support some Android features including Google Fast Pair, Audio Switch, and Find My Device. Surprising from a company owned by Apple. I enjoyed the design and usability of these Beats earbuds, and I’d take them over the AirPods any day, but I still find the latest AirPods Pro easier to recommend. Read our full Beats Studio Buds+ review 5. Sennheiser Accentum True Wireless Pros Great value for money Supports AAC and aptX Light, comfortable design IP54 water and dust resistance Cons Average battery life Noise-cancellation could be better Price When Reviewed: $199.95 Best Prices Today: $129.95 at Amazon$129.95 at B\u0026H$129.99 at Best Buy Designed as a more affordable alternative to its Momentum earbuds, Sennheiser’s Accentum True Wireless is excellent value for money, providing good sound quality and noise-cancellation at a much lower price than Apple’s AirPods Pro. The Accentum also introduces a new design that is lighter and more streamlined than the rather chunky Momentum. The earbuds feel very light and comfortable to wear, and Sennheiser includes four different sizes of ear-tips to help you get a good fit. They’re sturdy too, with an IP54 rating for water and dust-resistance, so they can cope with life outdoors in this rather wet and windy summer that we seem to be having. The earbuds support AAC for Apple devices and aptX for Android, and the Sennheiser app includes some useful features, such as a five-band equalizer for fine-tuning the sound, and an adjustable ‘transparency’ control that lets in just as much sound as you need. Despite the lower price, the Accentum earbuds use the same 7mm drivers as the Momentum, which provide a healthy frequency response of 5Hz – 21kHz, and produce very good sound quality. The Accentum shows a delicate touch on the slow strings that open Madonna’s Frozen, allowing them to rise slowly and elegantly through the air. There’s a warm, silky tone to Madonna’s voice, but the Accentum can turn around suddenly and land the sharp drum beats with dramatic impact. Switching to something less ethereal, the deep electronic bass on Prime Evil by The Orb glides along with a firm, sinuous rhythm that gets the shoulders moving, while the jangling percussion adds an eerie, nervous energy to the track. The noise-cancellation features work well too – they don’t stamp out background noise quite as effectively as some of the Accentum’s more expensive rivals, but they’ll be fine for daily use when you’re out and about. Battery life is similar to the AirPods Pro, lasting for six hours when using noise-cancellation, while the wireless charging case gives you 2.5 additional charges. So while it might not be the best choice for long-distance travellers, the Accentum is a really good, affordable option for general day-to-day use when you’re wandering around town. 6. B\u0026W Pi7 S2 Pros Excellent sound quality  Supports AAC and aptX Adaptive  Charging case supports wired audio Cons Expensive Modest battery life Noise cancelation could be better Price When Reviewed: £399 Best Prices Today: $251 at Amazon$399 at B\u0026WNot Available at Best Buy Bowers \u0026 Wilkins’ Pi5 was previously on our list of best earbuds, and the new Pi7 S2 is even better, boasting improved sound quality and noise-cancellation and an innovative smart charging case that does more than just top-up the battery. Available in black, white or dark blue, the Pi7 S2 earbuds are a little more compact than their predecessors, providing a more comfortable fit, along with three sets of ear-tips in different sizes. They’re sturdy too, with an IP54 rating for water and dust resistance, so they’ll be a good option for exercise as well as traveling. The earbuds support both Apple’s AAC and the aptX Adaptive codec for Bluetooth audio, so they’ll work with a variety of computers and mobile devices. However, B\u0026W has come up with an ingenious smart charging case that makes the Pi7 S2 even more versatile. The charging case has a USB-C port for charging – and also supports Qi wireless charging too – but the USB-C port can also accept a wired audio input as well. There are USB-C and 3.5mm audio cables included, so you can connect the charging case to a wired music system, such as the music system in a gym, or the in-flight entertainment system on a plane, and the case can then act as a Bluetooth transmitter that streams the audio to the earbuds. This is a great idea, as it combines the convenience of Bluetooth wireless audio with the ability to connect to wired audio systems when you need to. The noise-cancellation features also work well when you’re in noisy environments such as a gym or on a plane – although they’re not quite as effective as the latest AirPods Pro. However, the Pi7 S2 wins hands-down when it comes to sound quality, with a wonderfully clear and balanced sound that works well for a variety of different musical styles. The bouncing bass on Bad Guy by Billie Eilish combines a relaxed, infectious rhythm with a firm, taut bass beat, but it copes equally well with the delicate violins and soprano vocal on Max Richter’s The Waves. The only real disappointment – especially at this price – is that the battery life is a modest five hours on a single charge. Fortunately, the charging case lets you recharge the earbuds three more times, so it should still be able to cope with some long plane flights when it needs to. 7. Creative Zen Air Pro Pros Great price Supports AAC Respectable noise-cancellation Wireless charging case Cons Lightweight plastic design Noise-cancellation can’t match the best Price When Reviewed: $69.99 Best Prices Today: $49.99 at Amazon$49.99 at Lenovo USA$69.99 at Creative Active noise-cancellation (ANC) is a standard feature with many modern earbuds and headphones, but it’s still an expensive feature that adds quite a lot to the overall price. For instance, Apple’s AirPods start at $129/£129, but you have pay $179/£179 to get ANC in the AirPods 4 with ANC, or $249/£229 to get ANC from the AirPods Pro, so we were impressed when Creative launched its new Zen Air Pro earbuds, which offer ANC for a very competitive $69.99/£59.99. And, unlike many more expensive models, the Air Pro even manages to include a wireless charging case as well. As you might guess from the name, the Air Pro bears more than a passing resemblance to Apple’s AirPods Pro, with rubber eartips and a small stalk that hangs down from your ears. Admittedly, the plastic earpieces and charging case don’t feel quite as sturdy as their Apple rivals, but the earpieces are rated IPX5 for water resistance, so they can cope with life outdoors when they need to. Battery life is also quite respectable, lasting for nine hours on a single charge, although using ANC does reduce that to six hours. The charging case brings the total battery life to 33 hours, or 22 hours with ANC. We were pleased to find that the Air Pro supports Apple’s AAC codec for Bluetooth audio (although the low cost means that there’s no aptX for Android users). It does a good job of handling the grinding, fuzz-drenched guitars on Supermassive Black Hole by Muse, but also shows a light touch on the fast percussion that skips through the chorus. It’s not fazed when I jump ahead a couple of tracks on the Black Holes album for the gentle Soldier’s Poem, catching the smooth, warm tone and all the details in Muse’s Queen-esque harmonies as they intone – “there’s no justice in the world…” The noise-cancellation feature also proves surprisingly effective for such a low-cost set of earbuds. It’s not quite as effective as some of its more expensive rivals, but the Air Pro still does a good job of reducing the low rumble of an aircraft engine during our listening tests. It does let in some of the more varied sounds in our test of airport background noise, but that’s also the case with many other headphones and earbuds, and the Air Pro’s noise-cancellation features represent excellent value at this price. 8. Apple AirPods 4 with ANC Pros Great overall audio quality Effective active noise cancelation Case with wireless charging support and Find My speaker Cons Fit is highly dependent on your personal ear shape Price compared to AirPods Pro Price When Reviewed: $179 with Active Noice Cancelation Best Prices Today: $178 at Amazon$179 at Adorama$179 at Apple The AirPods 4 with ANC offer many of the features found in the AirPods Pro 2, have a better fit than their predecessor, the AirPods 3, and have the same $179/£179 price tag. With each generation, Apple promises a better fit and Apple says these are “the most comfortable AirPods ever.” We did find them closer to being a proper fit than the AirPods 3, but every ear is different and your experience may vary. We find the AirPods Pro with silicon ear tips fit a lot better and securely, but they cost a lot more and some prefer the more open design of the AirPods. Apple offers the AirPods 4 in two variations: the $179/£179 model with active noise cancelation, and a cheaper $129/£129 model without that feature (below). The active noise cancellation feature includes two sound isolation modes: Adaptive Audio and Transparency. You also get Conversation Awareness, which was previously only available on the AirPods Pro. You’ll have to decide whether the extra features are worth the extra $50/£50. We think they are.  The effectiveness of the AirPods 4’s active noise cancelation is heavily affected by the open design, though. The AirPods 4 don’t absolutely cancel the noise around you. If you want “full” noise cancellation and you’re comfortable with silicon ear tips inside your ear canal, the AirPods Pro (above) are a better choice. We love the Conversation Awareness feature, where the volume automatically lowers when the AirPods 4 detects you are talking. It works better with one-on-one conversations rather than groups of people.  Sound quality is delightful for general-purpose, open earphones. The AirPods 4 handle loaded tracks like 311’s “Need Somebody” with ease; the bass in Real Boston Richey’s “Help Me” is clean, heavy, and lacks distortion. The guitars in acoustic tracks like Fog Swamp’s “Split the Sky” are crisp and clear. We were impressed with the clarity and volume of voice recordings in podcasts and during phone calls. They weren’t quite as good as with the AirPods Pro, but it was close.  The AirPods 4 USB-C case that comes with the $179/£179 model has a speaker to play alerts through Find My. It also supports USB-C or wireless charging and works with the Apple Watch charger as well as Qi chargers. (It doesn’t support MagSafe like the AirPods Pro case, but a MagSafe charger will work if placed correctly.) The cheaper model’s case only offers wired USB-C charging. If you use active noise cancelation, it shortens the AirPods 4’s battery life. When fully charged, Apple states a 4-hour listening time with the earbuds and 20 hours of charge with the case. Turn off ANC, and fully charged earbuds can last 5 hours, and the case adds 30 total hours. We got a bit better than that. The earbuds lasted 4 hours and 16 minutes. In the fully-charged case, their battery life was at 27 percent after five minutes–Apple says a five-minute charge provides an hour of life. The AirPods 4 with ANC offer numerous pro-level features, sound great, fit better than previous AirPods and offer extremely useful active noise cancelation. In short, the AirPods 4 are a great, all-around set of earphones. As long as they can stay in your ears. Read our full Apple AirPods 4 (with ANC) review 9. Logitech Zone True Wireless Pros Connects via Bluetooth or USB wireless adaptor Weather-resistant design, and two carrying cases Certified for use with Zoom, Teams, Google Meet Active noise cancellation with ambient mode Cons Expensive Large earbuds may not suit everyone Price When Reviewed: 299 Best Prices Today: $224.99 at B\u0026H$224.99 at Lenovo USA$299 at Logitech Logitech’s Zone True Wireless earbuds are even more expensive than Apple’s AirPods Pro, but they’re absolutely loaded with useful features, and there’s a particular emphasis on remote working as well as simply listening to music. Available in black or pink, the Zone earbuds make a great impression straight out of the box, as they arrive in a sturdy charging case that includes a little lanyard to help keep them safe. The earbuds are also rated IP68 for resistance to water and dust, so they’ll be ideal for running in the park or working out at the gym, and the outer section of the earbuds is covered with a mesh fabric to reduce wind noise during voice calls. Logitech even includes an additional padded carrying case, with room to hold the charging case and cables, so you can keep the entire kit safe when you’re traveling. I often have trouble getting earbuds to stay in place, and I was initially a little worried about the rather chunky design of the Zone earbuds, but they did fit more firmly than I expected and Logitech provides three sets of ear-tips in different sizes to help get a comfortable fit. The size of the earbuds also means that each earbud is able to house a 12mm driver, as well as three microphones to help with active noise-cancellation (ANC). Even the Logi Tune app impresses with its extensive range of features – starting with the fact that it’s available for Mac and Windows as well as iOS and Android, so you can use it to set up the earbuds when you’re preparing for a video call at work. The noise-cancellation features include an ambient mode that lets you hear some of the background noise around you if required. You can pair the earbuds with two devices at the same time and then quickly switch between devices as required, and there’s a five-band equalizer for fine-tuning the sound quality. The Zone is also certified for use with Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Google Meet for video calls. But, of course, none of those features would matter if the Zone didn’t deliver on sound quality. You’ve actually got two options here, as the Zone can be used as a conventional set of Bluetooth earbuds with your mobile devices, but also includes a USB wireless transmitter that can be used with Macs and PCs to provide greater range and reliability than Bluetooth. The sound quality is very good in both modes, and the Zone does well to dig right down to the gravelly rumble of Leonard Cohen’s voice on You Want It Darker. There’s a taut, rhythmic sound to the song’s slinky bass guitar too, but it still keeps an eye on lighter details, such as the crisp tap on the snares. Battery life is good too, providing 10 hours when listening to music with noise-cancellation turned off, or six hours when using noise-cancellation. The battery life is a bit lower for talk-time on video and voice calls, but still lasts for six hours without noise cancellation or five hours with noise cancellation, which should be more than enough for most work-related calls. The charging case also lets you fully charge the earbuds two more times, and there’s a QuickCharge feature that gives you one hour of battery life after just five minutes of charging time. There’s a USB-C connector on the case for charging, but it also supports Qi wireless charging too. Alternatively, if you’re a die-hard lover of wired headphones, then Logitech is planning to release a wired version of the Zone soon as well. 10. Apple AirPods 4 (without ANC) Pros Improved design and fit Great price Cons No ANC No wireless charging Price When Reviewed: $129 without Active Noise Cancelation Best Prices Today: $119 at Amazon$129 at Apple$129 at B\u0026H The AirPods 4 gain all the same design improvements as the AirPods 4 with ANC included above. They have a better fit than their predecessor, so should stay in your ears. They replace the $129/£129 3rd generation AirPods that used a Lightning port to charge, at the same price. Like the AirPods they replace these AirPods don’t offer wireless charging, but they do offer one hour more battery life than the AirPods 4 with ANC do. If you want Active Noise Cancelation you need to pay $50/£50 more to purchase the AirPods 4 with ANC, or look at one of the other options in this round up, many of which offer ANC for less. As well as missing out on Active Noise Cancelation, the standard AirPods 4 don’t offer Adaptive Audio and Transparency mode, Conversation Awareness, or a speaker on the case for Find My alerts. As mentioned they are not capable of wireless charging either. Otherwise, they’re the same though. The AirPods 4 have an H2 chip like the ANC model as well as the same audio quality, fit, and features. . 11. Sony WF-1000XM5 Pros The best-sounding earbuds ever Incredible noise canceling Clever smart features Hi-Res support Cons Fiddly on-bud volume controls Occasionally come loose Some connection issues Price When Reviewed: $299.99 Best Prices Today: $298 at Adorama$298 at Amazon$298 at B\u0026H Sony’s XM5 have better design, fit, battery life, and sound than their predecessor (the WF-1000XM4, which you can find below). We were glad to find a fourth ‘SS’ size of extra small eartips, and every size is polyurethane foam rather than silicone, which creates an airtight seal in the ear. The buds are a glossy plastic, but the touch-sensitive outer part is matt, as is the compact charging case. The buds are IPX4 splashproof (the case isn’t). That touch area allows for taps or holds to do things such as pause or play audio, toggle noise canceling, or change volume. Unfortunately, you can’t swipe to change volume, instead tapping four times on left for down and four on right for up – which isn’t the most intuitive. The WF-1000XM5 produce incredibly full, clear, detailed and balanced sound. They deliver exceptionally good audio range. ‘Speed of Plight’ by Loyle Carner is well rounded with humming bass and the crackle of vinyl record at the beginning crystal clear. I’d never noticed the light reverb on the drums on Violent Femmes’s ‘Blister in the Sun’ before I listened on the WF-1000XM5. The XM5 play audio using the common SDC or AAC codecs, but you’ll get the best sound quality if you are using an Android phone – iPhones do not support Sony’s LDAC Hi-Res codec, which is why these don’t rank higher in our chart. The XM5 are so good that I still enjoyed the audio quality when using an iPhone with bog standard bitrate Spotify streams. Sony says the XM5 have 20% better noise cancellation chops than predecessors, the XM4. They are very good indeed. The XM5 have three mics on each bud, up from two, to better help capture ambient noise. These mics also grant improved call quality. Wind reduction is also decent. You can connect two devices (iOS, Android, Windows, or Mac) at once, but you still need to manually connect each device if you are cycling between more than two. Unfortunately they aren’t clever enough to switch from iPhone to iPad if you start using that, even if they are already a paired device. The XM5 have great battery life and fulfilled Sony’s promise of eight hours on a full charge. The case can provide another 24 hours of total listening time. Those times are with ANC on, turn it off and the battery will last even longer. A three-minute charge gives an hour playback. Henry Burrell. Read our full Sony WF-1000XM5 review 12. Soundcore AeroFit Pro Pros Open-ear design for sport Large drivers, with strong bass Firm fit, with detachable neckband Supports AAC, LDAC codecs Cons Hooked earpieces may not suit everyone No noise cancellation Sound quality requires a good fit Price When Reviewed: $169.99 Best Prices Today: $169.99 at Amazon$169.99 at B\u0026H$169.99 at Best Buy Most earbuds include several sets of rubber eartips that are designed to fit firmly inside your ear canal, in order to provide good sound quality and block out background noise (and also to stop them falling out every five minutes). But, just recently, we’ve seen the introduction of a new type of ‘open ear’ earbuds, which tend to sit quite loosely in the outer ear instead (rather like Apple’s basic AirPods, whereas the AirPods Pro opt for a ‘closed’ design that does use rubber eartips). These open-ear earbuds tend to be designed with sport in mind, so that you can hear what’s going on around you while you’re jogging through the park, or working out in a crowded gym. That’s very much the case with the AeroFit Pro earbuds from Soundcore (which is a division of Anker, well-known for its docks and other accessories). Priced at $169.99/£149.99, and available in a variety of colours, the AeroFit Pro also has the hooked design that is common with many sports earbuds, and wraps around the back of the ear to hold them in place. And, just to be extra safe, the AeroFit Pro also includes a detachable neckband as well. I didn’t really need the neckband, though, as the hooks on the earpieces held them in place pretty well. However, I did find that the earpieces sat quite high in my ears, which felt a little odd, so it might be worth trying the AeroFit Pro in a store or a showroom to see how they fit you before buying. These open-ear designs can sometimes sacrifice a little sound quality in order to ensure that you remain aware of your surroundings, but Soundcore has made a good effort to provide the best possible sound quality. The AeroFit Pro houses 16.2mm drivers, which are far larger than most rival earbuds in this price range. It doesn’t quite provide the ‘thumping bass’ that Soundcore boasts about, but the electronic bass on Bad Guy by Billie Eilish did have a taut, firm beat to it. The bass didn’t overpower the sound either, with the AeroFit Pro lending a sharp snap to the finger-clicking on the chorus, and catching the breathy tone in Billie’s vocal. And, without noise-cancellation features to drain the battery you’ll get around 14 hours on a single charge, while the charging case lets you recharge three more times. Our only minor complaint is that the case doesn’t support Qi for wireless charging as well. How to choose earbud headphones There are a few factors to consider before you hit that buy button. Type Earbuds, or in-ear headphones, typically fall into three main categories: Earbuds – the type of headphones included with every iPhone and iPod and sit loosely in your outer ears. Although earbuds don’t produce outstanding sound, they’re compact and relatively inexpensive. Apple’s stock ‘buds are actually decent as earbuds go; you’re not going to get a huge upgrade in sound quality by simply replacing them with a different model. Still, there are a few alternatives out there that provide modest improvements if you’re looking for a new set. Recommendations: In-Ear-Canal Headphones: These headphones, also known as canalphones, use silicone or foam eartips that fit snugly—and fairly deep—in your ear canals. Like earplugs, they block most external noise, so they’re great for travel and noisy environments. They’re also capable of producing stunning audio quality. On the other hand, some people find canalphones to be uncomfortable, and the best ones come with an equally stunning price tag. If you decide to spend the big bucks on a set of high-end canalphones, we enthusiastically recommend going all-in and getting custom eartips—tips custom-made for your particular ears. The process requires an audiologist visit to get impressions taken of your ears, but the benefits include substantially better comfort. (On some models, you may gain better noise isolation and better sound quality, as well.) A step above custom eartips are custom in-ear monitors, which place the actual headphone circuitry in larger, custom-made earpieces. Canalbuds: Canalbuds, which occupy a middle ground between earbuds and in-ear-canal models, have become quite popular. Compared to canalphones, canalbuds generally use smaller eartips that sit just inside the ends of your ear canals instead of deep inside them. Good canalbuds easily best earbuds in terms of audio performance and noise isolation, but fall short of good canalphones in those areas. On the other hand, canalbuds tend to be more comfortable than true canalphones because they don’t sit so deep and don’t fit so tightly; they’re also usually less expensive. (See our in-ear-canal-headphone primer, linked above, for more information on canalbuds.) Battery life This is crucial as many in-ear headphones have tiny batteries that help to keep the weight down but may only last for a few hours. That might be fine if you just want to listen to some music while you’re working out, but won’t be much use on a long journey by train or plane. However, some in-ear headphones, such as Apple’s AirPods, also include a charging case that can top up the battery, so that’s something you should check on before buying any in-ear headphones. Noise canceling Some headphones are specifically designed for people who travel a lot or use headphones in noisy conditions and provide active noise-canceling (ANC) option that helps to block out background noise on trains and planes – although this can add quite a lot to the overall price of the headphones. Note this isn’t to be confused with passive noise isolation (or often referred to as canceling), which is just the way physically having headphones in/on blocks sound – like putting earplugs or ear defenders on. Sound quality We’d always recommend trying out any new headphones in a store or showroom whenever possible, but that’s not always practical with so many new headphones competing for your attention. Compatibility All the headphones here will work excellently with the latest iPhone models. It’s typical for them to support Apple’s preferred AAC codec, although some will have others too like aptX which is handy if you want to also use them with other devices like Android phones. It’s also worth noting that all Bluetooth headphones mentioned in this article are compatible with the Apple Watch – perfect when going for a run.",

These are items that have been returned, but in most respects you wouldn’t be able to tell. Apple replaces the battery and outer shell of every refurbished iPad, and you’ll still get all of the accessories and manuals that would come with a new model. Plus, you’ll also get the same one-year warranty as you would with a brand-new iPad. The only thing that gives the game away is the box: Apple replaces the original with a white box to prevent people from buying the discounted models and selling them as new. Apple Education Store Don’t forget students can get discounts on iPad devices as a part of Apple’s Education Discount. That concludes our guide to the best iPad deals available right now. But if you’re unsure of which model you should pick up, take a look at our in-depth iPad buying guide.",

    "description": "Macworld You can find great deals on a new iPad if you know where to look. We’ve checked all the best places to pick up the iPad at the best price for you so that you can get a bargain. Following Apple’s May 7 event (where new iPad Pro and iPad Air models were announced) Apple removed the 9th-gen iPad from the lineup and adjusted pricing for the 10th-gen iPad. Pricing is now as follows: iPad (10th generation): $349/£349/€439 (was $449/£499/€589) The 9th-gen iPad from 2021 was discontinued, but you can still find deals on that model while stock holds out. At launch, the 9th-gen iPad cost $329/£319/€379, but it actually went up in price to $329/£369/€439 before being killed off. Make sure you’re paying less than that.

Hopefully this won’t also be the case with the 10th-gen iPad, but if it is you might find a unit at one of these major retailers: U.S. retailers Apple Amazon Best Buy Costco Target Walmart U.K. retailers Apple Amazon Argos Currys John Lewis KRCS Very Apple has a number of Apple Premium Resellers who stock iPads in the U.K., and also offer other services, try the following: KRCS, often the first to discount new products iStore Select Western Computer Where to buy the iPad on contract If you want to buy the iPad on contract you could try these networks: U.S. network carriers AT\u0026T Verizon T-Mobile U.K. network carriers EE O2 Sky Vodafone Virgin Media Three Best refurbished iPad deals The deals you will see above are generally from Apple resellers rather than Apple itself, which very rarely drops the prices. Apple does, however, sell reconditioned iPads in its refurbished store. So you might be able to grab a bargain. The iPads in Apple’s refurbished store may be ex-display stock, or they may have been returned to Apple due to a fault, but they are fully reconditioned now and come with a full year’s warranty. It’s not like buying secondhand. The U.S. refurbished store has a selection that includes: Standard iPad (8th and 9th generation) iPad Air (4th generation) 11-inch iPad Pro (2nd and 3rd generation) 12.9-inch iPad Pro (4th and 5th generation) iPad mini (5th and 6th generation) Compared to the original price, you can save as much as $320 on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Get a refurbished iPad at Apple's refurbished store (U.S.) In the U.K. you’ll find a similar selection of iPads available from Apple’s refurbished store. You’ll find the following: Standard iPad (9th generation) iPad Air (4th generation) 11-inch iPad Pro (2nd and 3rd generation) 12.9-inch iPad Pro (5th generation) iPad mini (5th and 6th generation) There are savings of £480 on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, compared to the original price. Get a refurbished iPad at Apple's refurbished store (U.K.) Another place to look is BackMarket US and BackMarket UK, which sells refurbished Macs and other Apple products. Amazon also has a certified refurbished store for Apple products, but we would advise against buying any products that are older than five years. Most of the products we see on the Amazon refurbished store are unfortunately very old. There is a large refurbished market for the iPad. We’d recommend taking a look at these refurbished resellers for iPad offers: Amazon AWD Big Phone Store eBay Envirofone Affordable Mac Tech Trade 4Gadgets Handtec Laptops Direct Music Magpie Preloved Smartfone Store",

    "description": "Macworld We’ve all been there. You connect to the guest Wi-Fi at a hotel, gym, coffee shop, or airport—someplace where a web page is supposed to pop up for you to log in or agree to some terms of use before they let you connect to the internet. This is called a “Captive Portal” and it can be a big source of frustration with public or Wi-Fi. If you find your iPhone or iPad will connect to the Wi-Fi but never opens the Captive Portal and doesn’t let you access the internet, try these four tips. Most of these apply to Mac as well. The main thing is to just be patient–it can sometimes take longer than you would expect for the portal to pop up. If it doesn’t open after 30 seconds, or it opens and is blank, try these steps. For more help with your iPhone Wi-Fi read: How to stop an iPhone dropping Wi-Fi connection and Wi-Fi or 4G not working: How to fix internet problems on iPhone. Disable extensions The web is a mess, and it’s not uncommon to run an ad blocker, script blocker, privacy protector, or other add-on for Safari that can block or modify content. But these can prevent Captive Portals from popping up, so you’ll want to disable them for the time being. Before you connect to the guest Wi-Fi, open Safari and tap the Reader button at the left side of the address bar. Then choose Manage Extensions and make sure your plugins are disabled. On a Mac, you’ll find an Extensions tab in Safari’s Settings menu. Then try connecting to the Wi-Fi again. Manual override If it’s not working even with your Safari extensions disabled, you can force the Captive Portal to open manually. When connected to the Wi-Fi, open Safari and go to captive.apple.com/hotspot-detect.html. Foundry Foundry Foundry This often redirects to the Captive Portal for the Wi-Fi you’re connected to and you’re good to go. Sometimes it will show what looks like a blank page with the word “Success” in very small type in the upper left. If you see that, you may have connected to this portal before and you’re authorized and reconnected—just try going to another site to see if it works now. Forget and reconnect Sometimes you get stuck in a sort of purgatory where your iPhone thinks you’re authorized and the Wi-Fi system thinks you’re not. One of the best ways to deal with this is to forget the Wi-Fi network and join it again. If your device says you’ve joined the Wi-Fi network (but don’t have internet access), open Settings, Wi-Fi, and tap on the name of the Wi-Fi hotspot you’re connected to. Then tap Forget This Network at the top of the screen, and then Forget on the confirmation pop-up. Foundry Foundry Foundry You can then try reconnecting to that hotspot again. Try NeverSSL As a last-ditch effort, you can try the NeverSSL page. SSL (secure sockets layer) is prominent on the web these days. Browsers go to great lengths to use encryption, strong authentication, etc. That’s a very good thing! But sometimes if a Wi-Fi management system is not behaving well or conflicting with the security features of your browser, it can prevent the Captive Portal authorization page from popping up. Connect to the Wi-Fi, then type http://neverssl.com into Safari’s address bar. You’ll be taken to a page that doesn’t use SSL, HTTP 2.0, HSTS, or anything else. Just an old, antiquated, insecure HTTP 1.0 page. Sometimes this ancient insecure HTTP request will be just the thing to cause the Captive Portal login page to display.",

    "title": "Do Apple’s iOS charging limits actually do anything for battery health?",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2471745/does-apples-new-iphone-restriction-actually-do-anything-for-battery-health.html",
    "description": "Macworld With the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro, Apple added a new battery management feature where users can charge those phones to a maximum of 80 percent instead of 100. It’s also possible to view the charging cycles in the battery settings. These features have carried over the the recently released iPhone 16 lineup. Why stop charging at 80 percent? It has to do with battery chemistry and the effects of charging over the long haul. A lower percentage results in fewer full charging cycles, which helps extend the viability of the battery. But charging to 80 percent means you effectively have less charge on your phone for your daily use. So the daily sacrifice worth the long-term effect? We wanted to find out. Macwelt (Macworld’s sister site in Germany) held a survey on Facebook Germany, asking readers to post screenshots of their battery settings and enter their charging behavior–whether they always or almost always charge to 100 or only to 80 percent. In less than 24 hours, we received more than 100 usable responses. To visually assess the influence of charging behavior on battery health, we have presented the responses in a combined box and Beeswarm plot. The two colors or lines on the Y-axis represent the data points in the two categories, people who only charge their iPhones to 80 percent and those who charge them to 100 percent. The number of dots shows how many people with the respective battery capacity we counted in each category. We counted 56 users who charge their iPhones to 100 percent and 46 users who only charge to 80 percent. The two groups are not the same size, but close. The superimposed boxes in the diagram show the cumulative analyses of the data. The box in the 80 percent category tends more towards the edge of 100 percent capacity– it appears that the users who charge their iPhones to 80 percent tend to have a healthier battery in the long term. We tested this hypothesis using a T-test, a common statistical method to prove that two independent groups differ significantly from each other. If the P-value is less than 0.05, (less than 5 percent), the two groups differ significantly. If the P-value is higher, the factor under investigation (in our case, the charging behavior) does not influence the data collected. We calculated the T-test once with the entire 102 data points in the table and obtained a P-value of 0.047121 (4.7121 percent). In the second calculation, we filtered out all data points where the charge cycles were less than 140, as the battery cannot be expected to age significantly up to 140 charges. Here we obtained 89 data points, six data points less in each category. But even with this data, the calculated P-value was 0.047547 (4.7547 percent). We can therefore say that charging behavior has a statistically significant influence on battery health and longevity. Based on our data, it can be said with certainty that users who do not charge their iPhones to 100 percent are conserving the battery through this behavior. The maximum capacity of the battery decreases somewhat more slowly when charging to 80 percent than when charging to 100 percent. For more information, you can learn about properly changing your iPhone.",

    "title": "iPadOS 18 superguide: What you need to know about the iPad update",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2377675/ipados-18-superguide-features-release.html",
    "description": "Macworld iPadOS 18 arrived alongside iOS 18, watchOS 11 and macOS Sequoia on Monday, September 16. As always, many of the new features are also present in iOS 18. But there are also some exciting new things just for iPad users, including, at long last, a new Calculator app. There are many more features yet to come, including Apple Intelligence, which is currently being developed. The first Apple Intelligence features will arrive with iPadOS 18.1, with more features coming throughout 2025 In this article, you can find all the things you need to know about iPadOS 18. This includes which iPads are compatible with iPadOS 18 and the new features you can expect. We will also note any developments in the beta testing program, which continues while Apple works on new features yet to arrive in iPadOS 18. So, stay tuned to this superguide for everything you need to know about iPadOS 18, the latest version, what’s coming in the next update, and any problems and fixes you might need to know about. If you have an iPad Pro with M4 chip we recommend you don’t install the update until iPadOS 18.0.1 arrives, as there have been reports of problems with the update. iPadOS 18: Release date Monday, September 16 iPadOS 18 became available to download on September 16. macOS Sequoia, watchOS and iOS 18 were launched at the same time. iPadOS 18: Latest version iPadOS 18.0.1: October 3, 2024 The latest version is iPadOS 18.0.1. It arrived on October 3, about two and a half weeks after iPadOS 18 launched. The iPadOS 18.0.1 update allowed Apple to address some bugs and problems with the initial release, these included an update that addressed an issue with iPadOS 18 causing the iPad Pro M4 to stop working. This problem was so serious that Apple had to stop availability of iPadOS 18 for those devices. See: iPadOS 18 update pulled after bricking M4 iPad Pro. In addition, iPadOS 18.0.1 addressed an issue where Messages could quit when replying to a message with a shared Apple Watch face, and a memory allocation issue that could impact performance. Apple is working on a beta of iOS 18.1, which includes Apple Intelligence features, so this may be the next update. iPadOS 18: Problems iPad Pro bricked – Apple had to pull the iPad OS 18 update because it was bricking “a small number of” iPad Pro models. In a thread on Reddit one M4 iPad Pro owner described how during the iPadOS 18 update his “iPad turned off, and would no longer turn on… I tried all of the reset options but nothing worked. I just took it to the Apple Store who confirmed it’s completely bricked”. This issue was addressed in the iPadOS 18.0.1 update. iPadOS 18: How to install Updating to the new version is simple, but if you’re unsure how then you can look at the detailed instructions from our guide on how to update iPadOS on your iPad. iPadOS 18: Compatiblity Apple Apple Apple These are the iPad models that make the cut for iPadOS 18, so if you’re wondering whether you’ll be able to upgrade, here’s the list: iPad Pro (M4) iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd gen and later) iPad Pro 11-inch (1st gen and later) iPad Air (M2) iPad Air (3rd gen and later) iPad (7th gen and later) iPad mini (5th gen and later) It should be noted though that not all models will be able to run the full range of new features, as some will rely on the latest hardware, most notably Apple Intelligence (coming later in 2024), which will only be available for M1-powered iPads and above, and then only if Siri is set to use U.S. English. iPadOS 18: Latest Beta and next verison of iPadOS Apple is testing iPadOS 18.1 with the first set of Apple Intelligence features. It’s expected this will be released in October. You can read more about the features of those betas, and the latest versions, in our iOS 18 superguide and in our guide to Apple Intelligence. iPadOS 18: How to install the beta Apple offers a beta testing program for members of the public who would like to try out new features before iPadOS 18 launches. Those testers also get to try out new features that aren’t ready in time for the full release–Apple continues development for the year following the release. The process is simple—just enroll your device and select the beta from the Software Update tab in Settings. Click Sign Up on the Apple Beta page and register with your Apple ID. Log in to the Beta Software Program. Click Enroll your iOS device. Open Settings, tap General, then Software Update. In the Beta Updates section, select the iOS Public Beta. If you want to uninstall the beta and stop receiving beta updates read this: How to remove an iOS beta from your iPhone. iPadOS 18: New features Apple Intelligence AI is all the rage at the moment, and Apple is getting on that hype train with its own AI named Apple Intelligence, which will arrive with iOS 18.1. It will bring a variety of new features to the iPad, including a new Siri experience, tools to help you improve your writing, summaries of emails and web pages, and much more, including powerful image generation tools to make your own emoji and illustrations. Apple Apple Apple Most iPads won’t be able to install it, however. Apple Intelligence is restricted to M1-powered iPads and above, which leaves out everything but the iPad Air and iPad Pro. But if it’s as good as Apple says, it could be worth the upgrade. Coming in iPadOS 18.1 Calculator Apple Apple Apple They said it couldn’t be done! Well, more accurately, no one ever understood why Apple just didn’t do it. But the new standalone Calculator app for the iPad might have been worth the wait. Along with the the standard and scientific layouts, Apple has also introduced a new features called Math Notes that lets you use your Apple Pencil to scribble formulas that are instantly solved as write. And if you go back to change something, it’ll even update your work in real time. Photos Apple Apple Apple The Photos app gets a serious makeover in iPadOS 18, with the top of the main page now showing a collage of your photo stream, Below, Apple has added Collections that automatically organizes your library into topics such as Recent Days and People \u0026 Pets. You can also set Pinned Collections for quick access to your favorite collections and albums. Customization Apple Apple Apple One of the most eye-catching changes coming in iPadOS 18 is the ability to fully customize your Home Screen pages. Now you’ll be able to add a color tint to app icons, making them appear uniformly shaded in a hue that you can match to your wallpaper. There’s also the ability to place icons where you like without them immediately snapping back to the next open spot on the grid, as well as making them larger and removing the name beneath. In iPadOS 18, tapping and and holding on an icon to bring up its options, which now include the ability to instantly turn an icon into a widget if one is available. If you want to keep an app private, iPadOS 18 brings the ability to lock certain apps or hide them from view, with Face ID or Touch ID the only way to gain access. Control Center gets some customization options too, with several new pages of control. Users now are able to add more controls to the list, plus resize them to suit their tastes. And third-party developers will be able to make their own controls as well. Notes Apple Apple Apple One of the best Apple apps on the iPad is Notes. It’s been slowly building into something of a powerhouse over the year, and iPadOS 18 brings even more improvements. First up, you can now highlight text to quickly mark up important parts of your notes. You can also hide text with collapsible section headers to better organize longer writings. That’s not all though, as Smart Script will turn Apple Pencil-written notes into more consistent versions, with the feature tidying up your messy writing so it looks more legible. A cool additional capability is that if you paste a text note into a handwritten notes, it will now be converted into the style of your handwriting to match the rest of the document. There’s also a Live Audio Transcription feature that will automatically transcribe any audio notes you make, giving you a text version when you’re done. Password Manager Apple Apple Apple iCloud Keychain has been a feature of Apple devices for a long time, but in iPadOS 18 it will turn into a dedicated Passwords app. With this, you can manage all of your passwords, passkeys, and Wi-Fi codes, and securely share them with friends or family members. It’s all encrypted of course, and could be something that the entries in our best password manager chart will be very worried about. iPadOS 18: Other features Apple Apple Apple There are plenty of additional features coming in iPadOS 18 that will be available on your iPad this fall: Floating Navigation Bar: The small and quick tab bar is now available on most of Apple’s apps, allowing you to stay in full-screen mode but have access to navigation tools. Game Mode: Reduces the in-game response time, improving performance, while also reducing the latency of Bluetooth controllers. Audio latency is also reduced when wearing AirPods. Messages: Text formatting comes to Messages in iPadOS 18, along with Tapbacks that allow you to respond to people with any emoji. There’s also a new feature that lets you schedule messages to be sent at a later time or date. Safari updates: Quickly pull up the highlights on a webpage (most relevant information), and an improved Reader design that includes a summary of the page as well as a table of contents. Shareplay updates: You can now share your screen and draw on it so that friends or family can follow the instructions that you’re giving them. If they want more direct assistance, then they can now allow you to remotely operate their device. Freeform: The Freeform app now includes a Scenes feature which you can use to quickly move through various areas of the document. Privacy: You can now decide which contacts an app can see, and the Privacy section layout has been improved to make it easier to navigate. So, as you can see, there are lots of reasons to install iPad OS 18. If you want all the features mentioned above, then it may require upgrading to a new device. You can check out our best iPad deals and best iPad Pro deals to see if there’s a bargain on a new model that will allow you to get your hands on all the best bits Apple is adding to iPads in iPadOS 18. iPadOS 19 In 2025 Apple will start work on the next version of iPadOS. Expect that to be launched on a similar date as the last few generations of iPadOS launches: iPadOS 18: September 16, 2024 iPadOS 17: September 18, 2023 iPadOS 16: October 24, 2022 iPadOS 15: September 20, 2021 iPadOS 14: September 16, 2020 iPadOS 13: September 24, 2019",

Version iOS 18.0.1 fixes some important bugs. iOS 18: Release date Monday, September 16 iOS 18 arrived on Monday, September 16. macOS Sequoia, watchOS and iPadOS 18 were also launched around the same time. iOS 18: Latest version iOS 18.0.1: October 3, 2024 The latest version is iOS 18.0.1. It arrived on October 3, about two and a half weeks after iOS 18 launched. The first update allowed Apple to address some bugs and problems with the initial release, these included: – Touch screen may be temporarily unresponsive in certain circumstances on iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models.– Camera may freeze when recording macro mode video on the Ultra Wide camera in 4K with HDR turned off on iPhone 16 Pro models.– Messages may unexpectedly quit when replying to a message with a shared Apple Watch face.– Performance may be impacted due to an issue with memory allocation on some iPhone models. Apple is also working on a beta of iOS 18.1, which includes Apple Intelligence features. Apple Intelligence is not available in the first version. The first set of features will come in iOS 18 with more following in subsequent updates. See our detailed roadmap of Apple Intelligence features and their likely release dates. Also read: iOS 18 is missing more than just Apple Intelligence iOS 18: Problems and bugs Messages bug: A Messages bug that could cause crashes and may even result in the loss of valuable data was reported. It seemed to be connected to an Apple Watch feature that lets users share their watch face over Messages (or Mail). Obviously, those are quite a niche set of circumstances and the best way to avoid it appears to be to not reply to watch faces in a thread. We have more information here: Link-sharing bug in iOS 18 Messages can cause iPhone crashes, data loss. Apple fixed this bug in iOS 18.0.1. Unresponsive touch screen: iPhone 16 Pro owners have complained of display ‘dead spots’, with taps and swipes are being ignored. It is thought that this is related to the Camera Control button. Apple addressed this bug in iOS 18.0.1. Camera freezes in macro mode: This was addressed in iOS 18.0.1. If you have any problems with iOS 18 you may be able to downgrade. Read: How to downgrade an iPhone from iOS 18 to iOS 17. iOS 18: Should I install iOS 18 on my iPhone? As long as your iPhone can run it, we recommend updating to iOS 18. The new features–all of which we discuss below–look enticing enough, and, so far, the only problem (see above) will not affect many people. We address how How iOS 17 and iOS 18 compare separately. Also take a look at: All the little details and hidden features in iOS 18 you won’t want to miss. However, we do recommend you wait a week or more so that any issues with the early release can be addressed: despite the beta program, there are often issues once the software update gets installed on mass-market iPhones. It’s also wise not to be one of the first downloaders because the download will likely take a lot longer if you try soon after it becomes available. iOS 18: How to install Installing iOS 18 and any subsequent updates is a breeze. Just open the Settings app on your iPhone and go to General \u003e Software Update; iOS will check for any available updates and guide you through the process of installing them. You simply have to follow the instructions, which we explain in our iOS updating guide. And it’s easier still if you’ve turned on Automatic Updates, which you can do from the same screen. A little work preparing your iPhone before installing the update can help avoid problems. We advise you follow these steps: Back up your iPhone: Back up before installing the new version and you will always be able to recover your iPhone with the older version of iOS running on it should things go wrong. Read: How to downgrade an iPhone. Make space on your iPhone: If your iPhone doesn’t have a lot of available space internally we recommend having a bit of a tidy-up so you can reclaim some iPhone storage. Simple ways to do this could include deleting apps you don’t use, deleting old Notes, Messages, and duplicated photos. Update your iPhone to the latest version: Don’t skip an update and go straight to iOS 18. If you haven’t installed iOS 17.6.1 yet do so now. iOS 18 compatibility: Which iPhones get iOS 18? The following iPhones get support for iOS 18, the same lineup of supported devices as iOS 17. iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, Pro, Pro Max iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, Pro, Pro Max iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, Pro, Pro Max  iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, Pro, Pro Max  iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, Pro, Pro Max iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, Pro Max  iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max iPhone XR iPhone SE (2nd gen or later) Read: iOS 18 compatibility: Which iPhones support iOS 18 and iOS compatibility checker Some of the new features will not be supported on the older phones, because they lack the hardware necessary (a powerful enough Neural Engine or GPU to run AI stuff, or enough RAM). This is typical of new iOS releases. In 2022, for example, the iPhone 8 and iPhone X missed out on a bunch of cool stuff due to their older processor. It is no surprise, therefore, that the hardware requirements are steep for the AI-related features aka ‘Apple Intelligence’—iPhone 15 Pro or later. Like iOS 17, iOS 18 does not support iPhone 8 or the iPhone X which came out in 2017, but since those phones are able to run iOS 16, they will continue to get support through security updates for at least another year. With the release of iOS 18 though, Apple will stop supporting iOS 15, which will mean that iPhone 7, 7 Plus, iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, and iPhone SE (1st generation) will no longer get support. Generally, Apple has provided software updates for the past two versions of iOS. See: How long does Apple support iPhones. iOS 18: Latest beta iOS 18.1 beta 5 – developer beta released September 23 iOS 18.0 RC – public beta Apple’s beta testing program for developers and public testers has been running since June/July and continues beyond the launch of iOS 18 to the general public. There is also a separate iOS 18 Sequoia 15.1 beta that includes some as yet unavailable Apple Intelligence features. Initially, this beta was only available for developers, but since the launch of iOS 18 it is now available to public testers, as long as they have supported hardware (iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, and iPhone 16 series). See: Everything Apple Intelligence can (and can’t) do in iOS 18.1. If you want to run the developer beta, you need to be a registered Apple software developer, which has both free and paid ($99/£79) versions. We explain How to join Apple’s beta program separately. Developer betas can be risky though, so we recommend signing up for the Public Beta instead, which should be more stable. Beware though: whether a public beta or a developer beta, any beta software is not as stable as the final version and the iOS and your apps may not work properly. Read Should you install the iOS 18 beta? for advice. Once registered, when you go to Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Update on your Mac, you’ll see a new tab for Beta Updates, which will list the version of the beta you’re running: choose either iOS 18 Developer Beta or iOS 18 Public Beta. If you need help installing the developer or public betas read our How to get the iOS beta article. If you then want to uninstall it, we have a guide for that: How to remove the iOS beta. iOS 18.1: Release date and new features iOS 18.1 release date: October (predicted) The following features are available in the initial iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 beta test so we expect them to arrive on compatible iPhones (and compatible iPads) in October: AI writing tools New and improved Siri Mail features like smart replies and email summaries Natural language in photos Call recording and transcription Safari web page summaries Clean Up tool in Photos iOS 18 features still to launch The following promised features aren’t yet in beta: ChatGPT integration Image Playground Genmoji Advanced Siri features like on-screen awareness, personal context, and actions within apps The image features were said to arrive at launch, but more recent reports say it will come later this ye iOS 18 features: The new features in iOS 18 There were many new features in iOS 17 including a new app called Journal, Live Voicemail, and a new way to use Stickers, among dozens of other smaller changes. Rumors suggested that iOS 18 would be “one of the biggest iOS updates — if not the biggest — in the company’s history.” As expected, in iOS 28 Apple will include some major new AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence, although these features will only be available on iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max and newer iPhones. Not all the new features will be available at launch. The first Apple Intelligence AI features will be introduced in iOS 18.1. Other features, such as the new categories in Mail, will come “later this year” in a subsequent software update. Read: These features will be missing when iOS 18 launches this fall. Customization There will be a more customizable Home Screen, Lock Screen, and Control Center in iOS 18. Several reports had claimed that Apple would allow greater personalization of the Home screen, including allowing users to place icons anywhere on the grid, allowing spaces between them. Prior to iOS 18 icons can be reordered or put into folders, but always fill the screen from left to right and top to bottom. In iOS 18 users will be able to arrange apps and widgets anywhere on the Home Screen, including right above the dock or framing a wallpaper. It will even be possible to change the lock screen icons or remove them. In addition, App icons and widgets can have a dark or tinted effect to blend in. Read: iOS 18: How to change the color of the app icons on your home screen and How to put app icons, widgets, and folders anywhere you want as well as iOS 18: How to make your app icons large and label-free. This “put icons wherever you want” feature is something we’ve wanted from Apple for many years, and has been a staple of many Android phones seemingly forever. The Control Centre is getting a redesign to give easier access to a user’s most-utilized controls. Users will also be able to add controls from supported third-party apps into Control Center. Is it enough? Read: Apple is finally letting you have it your way–kinda and You can finally customize your iPhone like Android–here’s everything you can do. Apple Apple Apple Photos New features in Photos will help users find their photos and keep big libraries organized. It’s the biggest redesign of Photos ever and is intended to help users find photos fast. It will be simplified but still familiar, according to Apple and will include a new Unified View, new Collections, and customization features. Users will be able to filter out clutter to narrow down to specific types of content. It will be possible to browse by topics, time, people, memories, trips, Recent Days and People and Pets. A new carousel view will present highlights that update each day – featuring favorite people, pets, and places. Apple Apple Apple Messages Messages will gain new ways to express yourself. Expect improvements to text formatting and fun new text effects. Tapbacks are getting redesigned and will let you tap back with any emoji or sticker. You’ll also be able to amplify and animate letters, word, phrases, and emoji, and add formatting like bold, underline, italics, and strikethrough. You will also be able to schedule a message to send later. Messages will also support RCS for more reliable group messaging with those who do not have an Apple device. Read about how your conversations with Android users will look in iOS 18 and RCS on iPhone with iOS 18: Every question answered. Apple is also making it possible to send Messages via Satellite so you can text when off the grid from Messages app. iMessages sent over satellite are encrypted. Apple Apple Apple Mail Mail will help you manage incoming email better with new on-device categorization. As email arrives it will be sorted into Primary (personal and time-sensitive), Transactions (confirmations and receipts), Updates (news and social notifications), and Promotions (marketing and coupons). A new Digest will pull together all relevant emails from a business, so for example, it could bring all flight information together. The Mail Categorization features will be available later this year. Safari A new Highlights feature is designed to make it easier to discover information on the web. A redesigned Reader experience will use machine learning to surface key information on a webpage so that users can review a summary to get the gist of an article. A table of contents will be included for longer articles Apple says users will also be able to quickly see the location of a restaurant, hotel, or landmark; or listen to an artist’s track right from an article about the song or album. You will also be able to snap away annoying ads. Apple Apple Apple Wallet and Apple Pay There will be new ways to pay with Apple Pay. Users can send and receive Apple Cash by holding two iPhones together: Tap to Cash will let you share cash without exchanging email or number. Tickets in Apple Wallet including key event information like an event guide with info about the venue, and recommended Apple Music playlists Apple Apple Apple iPhone mirroring on the Mac iPhone Mirroring will grant users access to their iPhone via their Mac. It will be possible to see notifications from the iPhone on the Mac, and drag and drop files between the devices. Read: How iPhone Mirroring lets you access your iPhone on your Mac in macOS Sequoia. Other app updates: Journal – New features to help you keep track of goals, Insights view, calendar, writing streak, and actually search Maps – New topographic maps with trails (US national parks only) Game Mode – Will minimize background activity for the best frame rates Notes app – formulas and equations entered while typing will be solved Calendar – incorporates tasks from Reminders and a new monthly view Health app – Medical ID redesigned Emergency SOS Live Video Home app – guest access Accessibility – Eye Tracking iCloud – Apple is adding a “Keep Downloaded” option that prevents the file from being moved to iCloud and keeps the file on the device. Read about the new Keep Downloaded option. Apple didn’t discuss everything at WWDC. There were a number of features that didn’t make the WWDC keynote. Also see: Unannounced iOS 18 tweak lets you see the time even when your iPhone is dead. Privacy features iOS 18 will improve privacy. You will be able to control who can see your apps, which contacts you share with that app, and which accessories apps can connect to. You can also control whether others can view your apps on your iPhone by locking an app so it won’t open without Face ID or a passcode. A new locked hidden apps folder is also coming with iOS 18. Developers will have a way to seamlessly connect third-party accessories with iPhones without letting an app see all the other devices on a user’s network. Apple Apple Apple Apple Intelligence  Apple’s new artificial intelligence system is coming to iPhone, Mac, and iPad with iOS 18, macOS Sequoia, and iPadOS 18. Apple Intelligence will only be supported by iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max though. (Here’s why you’ll need to upgrade your iPhone to get Apple Intelligence, also read: Here’s why newer iPhones and Vision Pro can’t run Apple Intelligence). The hardware requirements are steep—iPhone 15 Pro or later. iPads will need at least an M1 chip or later as will Macs. Apple Intelligence features will mostly be processed on the device, which is different from other platforms where AI processing is done in the cloud. But Apple Intelligence will be able to determine if cloud processing is needed and will use it when appropriate. Apple Intelligence features include the following: Writing – Apple Intelligence will help users enhance their writing and communications. Writing Tools are built in systemwide that will offer to rewrite, proofread, and summarize text in writing focused apps such as Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps. Images – New image capabilities will also come to M-series Macs. In Image Playground users will be able to create images in three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch. Photos – A new Memories in Photos feature will create a video from photos and videos based on a description provided by the user. Apple Intelligence will pick out the photos and videos, develop a storyline based on the photos, and arrange them into a movie. In addition, a new Clean Up tool will identify and remove unwanted objects from the background of a photo. Read: Apple Intelligence FAQ: What it is, what it does, and when you’ll get it and Apple Intelligence is a gradual rollout—here’s what you’ll get, and when. Siri Siri is also getting some AI updates and ChatGPT is to be integrated into Siri. Because some queries will be handled off-device Apple is introducing Private Cloud Compute so that when data is sent to server-based models for processing it is not stored or made accessible to Apple. One of the simplest changes to Siri is that it will be easier to type to Siri rather than having to speak to the on-device assistant. Apple may have finally twigged that people don’t always want to talk to their phones. The new Siri is said to be more “conversational” and natural, with features that “help users in their day-to-day lives.” A new smart responses framework will help Siri take into account your own personal details in its replies: like people, companies, calendar events, locations, dates, and more. Later this year, Siri is said to get cross-device media control. So you can talk to Siri on one of your devices to control media playback on another. In an update scheduled for early 2025, Siri is said to gain the ability to control nearly any app, with hundreds of possible commands. This feature will start off with single commands for Apple’s own apps and grow to include third-party apps and commands with multiple steps. In addition, Siri will be able to react to and take actions based on what is on your screen. This is said to go into beta for developers in January, with a rollout to users in iOS 18.4 in the spring. New accessibility features Apple is planning several new accessibility features for iOS 18, including Adaptive Voice Shortcuts, which will let users turn on or off specific accessibility features using a custom phrase, and Live Speech, which lets users type what they want to say and have it read out loud on phone calls or video meetings, will get the ability to add saved phrases to categories. Features coming after the iOS 18 release Some iOS 18 features won’t be a part of the initial release. Rather, they will be released later in 2024 or in 2025 as part of an iOS 18 point release (iOS 18.2 or iOS 18.4, for example). Here are some of the more significant features we expect to come later in an iOS 18 update: Mail app features – Auto-categorizing of mail, mail digests, and summaries in your inbox are all features expected later in 2024. Home support for robot vacuums – The Home app won’t be able to start or stop your Roomba until later in 2024. Drag and Drop between iPhone and Mac – You’ll be able to see and control your iPhone on your Mac when iOS 18 and macOS 15 are released, but drag-and-drop support between your Mac and iPhone will come in an update. ChatGPT integration – The ability to call upon ChatGPT when using Apple’s AI tools will likely come later in 2024. Advanced Siri features – Siri features like its ability to see and react to what is on your display, semantic indexing (where Siri knows and uses information from across Messages, Mail, Contacts, and more), and advanced control over apps is all coming in 2025. Vehicle Motion Cues in iOS 18 will help reduce motion sickness. Third-party NFC transactions – Apple will allow third-party NFC transactions beginning with iOS 18.1–by request. In addition, all of the Apple Intelligence features will initially support only American English, and may be limited to only some regions. Additional languages and regions are likely to be available through 2025 and beyond. Next version of iOS We know that the next version of iOS after Apple finishes development of iOS 18 will be iOS 19. But what next in terms of software? Expect even more Apple Intelligence features to come in the late 2025 update to iOS and expect that iOS, iPadOS and macOS will be closer than ever. Over the past several years, the release of the new version of iOS has been fairly consistent, usually falling on the Monday following Apple’s iPhone launch event: iOS 18: Monday, September 16, 2024 iOS 17: Monday, September 18, 2023 iOS 16: Monday, September 12, 2022  iOS 15: Monday, September 20, 2021  iOS 14: Wednesday, September 16, 2020 iOS 13: Thursday, September 19, 2019 iOS 12: Monday, September 17, 2018",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",

    "description": "Losing Steve affected me more than it probably should have, given that I never met him or had any correspondence with him. But losing him was devastating — not just to my world, but the world. He was a sort of virtual father figure: I was always hoping that maybe Steve would notice something I did. We all wanted his attention and approval, and that drove us to do better work — even those of us who never worked at Apple. Nobody replaced him in this role. Nobody can. But as an outsider who had no personal relationship with him to mourn, it has been most depressing to consider how much of his work the world missed out on. He wasn’t taken from us after a long, complete life — he was taken in his prime. He had so much more to offer the world.",

    "title": "The future of the App Store",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2021/09/13/future-of-the-app-store",
    "description": "After the dust settles from the developer class-action settlement, the South Korean law, the JFTC announcement, and the Apple v. Epic decision, I think the most likely long-term outcome isn’t very different from the status quo — and that’s a good thing. Allowing external purchases Here’s what I think we’ll end up with: Apple will still require apps to use their IAP system for any qualifying purchases that occur in the apps themselves. All app types will be allowed to link out to a browser for other purchase methods. Most apps will be required to also offer IAP side-by-side with any external methods.1 Only “Reader apps” will be exempt from this requirement.2 Apple will have many rules regarding the display, descriptions, and behavior of external purchases, many of which will be unpublished and ever-changing. App Review will be extremely harsh, inconsistent, capricious, petty, and punitive with their enforcement.3 Apple won’t require price-matching between IAP and external purchases. These few but important corrections reduce Apple’s worst behavior and should relieve most regulatory pressure. The result won’t look much different than the status quo: Most big media apps (qualifying as “reader” apps) won’t offer IAP, but will finally be allowed to link to their websites from their apps and offer purchases there. Many games will offer both IAP and external purchases, with the external choice offering a discount, bonus gems, extra loot boxes, or other manipulative tricks to optimize the profitability of casino games for children (commissions from which have been the largest portion of Apple’s “services revenue” to date). Most importantly, many products, services, and business models will become possible that previously weren’t, leading to more apps, more competition, and more money going to more places. External purchase methods will evolve to be almost as convenient as IAP (especially if Apple Pay is permitted in this context), and payment processors will reduce the burden of manual credit-card entry with shared credentials available across multiple apps. The payment-fraud doomsday scenarios argued by Apple and many fans mostly won’t happen, in part because App Review will prevent most obvious cases, but also because parents don’t typically offer their credit cards to untrustworthy children; and for buyers of all ages, most credit cards themselves provide stronger fraud prevention and easier recourse from unwanted charges than the App Store ever has. No side-loading I don’t expect side-loading or alternative app stores to become possible, and I’m relieved, because that is not a future I want for iOS. When evaluating such ideas, I merely ask myself: “What would Facebook do?” Facebook owns four of the top ten apps in the world. If side-loading became possible, Facebook could remove Instagram, WhatsApp, the Facebook app, and Messenger from Apple’s App Store, requiring customers to install these extremely popular apps directly from Facebook via side-loading. And everyone would. Most people use a Facebook-owned app not because it’s a good app, but because it’s a means to an important end in their life. Social pressure, family pressure, and network lock-in prevent most users from seeking meaningful alternatives. People would jump through a few hoops if they had to. Facebook would soon have apps that bypassed App Review installed on the majority of iPhones in the world. Technical limitations of the OS would prevent the most egregious abuses, but there’s a lot they could still do. We don’t need to do much imagining — they already have attempted multiple hacks, workarounds, privacy invasions, and other unscrupulous and technically invasive behavior with their apps over time to surveil user behavior outside of their app and stay running longer in the background than users intend or expect. The OS could evolve over time to reduce some of these vulnerabilities, but technical measures alone cannot address all of them. Without the threat of App Review to keep them in check, Facebook’s apps would become even more monstrous than they already are. As a user and a fan of iOS, I don’t want any part of that. No alternative app stores Alternative app stores would be even worse. Rather than offering individual apps via side-loading, Facebook could offer just one: The Facebook App Store. Instagram, WhatsApp, the Facebook app, and Messenger could all be available exclusively there. The majority of iOS users in the world would soon install it, and Facebook would start using leverage in other areas — apps’ social accounts, stats packages, app-install ads, ad-attribution requirements — to heavily incentivize (and likely strong-arm) a huge number of developers to offer their apps in the Facebook App Store, likely in addition to Apple’s. Maybe I’d be required to add the Facebook SDK to my app in order to be in their store, which they would then use to surveil my users. Maybe I’d need to buy app-install ads to show up in search there at all. Maybe I’d need to pay Facebook to “promote” each app update to reach more than a tiny percentage of my existing customers. And Facebook wouldn’t even be the only app store likely to become a large player on iOS. Amazon would almost certainly bring their garbage “Appstore” to iOS, but at least that one probably wouldn’t go anywhere. Maybe Google would bring the Play Store to iOS and offer a unified SDK to develop a single codebase for iOS and Android, effectively making every app feel like an Android app and further marginalizing native apps when they’re already hurting. Media conglomerates that own many big-name properties, like Disney, might each have their own app stores for their high-profile apps. Running your own store means you can promote all of your own apps as much as you want. What giant corporation would resist? Don’t forget games! Epic and Steam would come to iOS with their own game stores. Maybe Microsoft and Nintendo, too. Maybe you’d need to install seven different app stores on your iPhone just to get the apps and games you already use — and all without App Review to keep them in check. Most developers would probably need to start submitting our apps to multiple app stores, each with its own rules, metadata, technical requirements, capabilities, approval delays, payment processing, stats, crash reports, ads, promotion methods, and user reviews. As a user, a multiple-app-store world sounds like an annoying mess; as a developer, it terrifies me. Apple’s App Store is the devil we know. The most viable alternatives that would crop up would be far worse. Course correction The way Apple runs its business isn’t perfect, but it’s also not a democracy. I loved this part of Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’ decision in Apple v. Epic, as quoted by Ben Thompson’s excellent article that you should read: Apple has not offered any justification for the actions other than to argue entitlement. Where its actions harm competition and result in supracompetitive pricing and profits, Apple is wrong. I interpret “entitlement” without a negative connotation here — Apple is entitled to run their platform mostly as they wish, with governmental interference only warranted to fix market-scale issues that harm large segments of commerce or society. As a developer, I’d love to see more changes to Apple’s control over iOS. But it’s hard to make larger changes without potentially harming much of what makes iOS great for both users and developers. Judge Gonzalez Rogers got it right: we needed a minor course correction to address the most egregiously anticompetitive behavior, but most of the way Apple runs iOS is best left to Apple. If the South Korean law holds, IAP may not be required — but only in South Korea. With this exception, I expect the rest of these rules to be enforced the same way globally. ↩︎ Apple defines “reader” apps as “[allowing] a user to access previously purchased content or content subscriptions (specifically: magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video).” This includes many apps that Apple’s services compete with, such as Netflix, Spotify, and Kindle, that raise anticompetitive concerns among regulators and legislators when forced to give Apple 30%. ↩︎ App Review has higher-level queues for managerial review of controversial rules or edge cases, typically identifiable from the outside by an app stuck with “In Review” status for days or weeks, and often ending in a phone call from “Bill”. I’d expect any app offering external purchases to have a very high chance of being escalated to a slower, more pain-in-the-ass review process, possibly causing it not to be worthwhile for most small developers to deal with. I have no plans to add external purchases to Overcast for multiple reasons, including this — but mostly because, for my purposes, I’m satisfied with Apple’s IAP system. ↩︎",

    "description": "Apple’s leaders continue to deny developers of two obvious truths: That our apps provide substantial value to iOS beyond the purchase commissions collected by Apple. That any portion of our customers came to our apps from our own marketing or reputation, rather than the App Store. For Apple to continue to deny these is dishonest, factually wrong, and extremely insulting — not only to our efforts, but to the intelligence of all Apple developers and customers. This isn’t about the 30%, or the 15%, or the prohibition of other payment systems, or the rules against telling our customers about our websites, or Apple’s many other restrictions. (Not today, at least.) It’s about what Apple’s leadership thinks of us and our work. *     *     * It isn’t the App Store’s responsibility to the rest of Apple to “pay its way” by leveraging hefty fees on certain types of transactions. Modern society has come to rely so heavily on mobile apps that any phone manufacturer must ensure that such a healthy ecosystem exists as table stakes for anyone to buy their phones. Without our apps, the iPhone has little value to most of its customers today. If Apple wishes to continue advancing bizarre corporate-accounting arguments, the massive profits from the hardware business are what therefore truly “pay the way” of the App Store, public APIs, developer tools, and other app-development resources, just as the hardware profits must fund the development of Apple’s own hardware, software, and services that make the iPhone appeal to customers. The forced App Store commissions, annual developer fees, and App Store Search Ads income are all just gravy. The “way” is already paid by the hardware — but Apple uses their position of power to double-dip. And that’s just business. Apple’s a lot of things, and “generous” isn’t one. But to bully and gaslight developers into thinking that we need to be kissing Apple’s feet for permitting us to add billions of dollars of value to their platform is not only greedy, stingy, and morally reprehensible, but deeply insulting. *     *     * Apple further extends the value argument, and defends their justification for forced commissions, by claiming responsibility for and ownership of the customer relationship between all iOS users and each app they choose to use. This argument only makes sense — and even then, only somewhat — when apps are installed by a customer browsing the App Store, finding an app they hadn’t previously heard of, and choosing to install it based on App Store influence alone. But in the common case — and for most app installations, the much more common case — of searching for a specific app by name or following a link or ad based on its developer’s own marketing or reputation, Apple has served no meaningful role in the customer acquisition and “deserves” nothing more from the transaction than what a CDN and commodity credit-card processor would charge. The idea that the App Store is responsible for most customers of any reasonably well-known app is a fantasy. It isn’t the App Store that has enabled all of the commerce on iOS — it’s the entire world of computing and modern society, created by a symbiotic ecosystem in which Apple played one part alongside many others. The world was already moving in this direction, and had Apple not played its part, someone else would’ve. The App Store is merely one platform’s forced distribution gateway, “facilitating” the commerce no more and no less than a web browser, an ISP or cellular carrier, a server-hosting company, or a credit-card processor. For Apple to continue to claim otherwise is beyond insulting, and borders on delusion. *     *     * At WWDC next week, these same people are going to try to tell us a different story. They’re going to tell us how amazing we are, how important our work is, and how much they value us. And for thousands of Apple employees who’ve made the great products and platforms that we love, including the hundreds of engineers presenting the sessions and working the labs, it’ll be genuine and true. But the leaders have already shown us who they really are, what they really think of us, and how much they value our work. Please forgive some sloppiness in my metaphors or phrasing — my writing skills are pretty rusty — and I’ll return the favor to anyone who responds.",

    "title": "In-App Purchase Rules",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2020/09/11/app-review-changes",
    "description": "A summary of today’s changes to 3.1.3 Other Purchase Methods: Your app must use Apple’s in-app-purchase (IAP) system for all purchases made in the app. Unless they’re purchases for goods or services that are consumed outside the app, in which case you are prohibited from using IAP. Unless those goods or services consumed outside the app are magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, or video, in which case, you are required to use IAP. But if your app only “reads” previously purchased magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, or video, and doesn’t mention the possibility of purchases anywhere in the app, you don’t need to use IAP. Unless you offer account creation, in which case, you are required to use IAP. Unless you only offer free account creation, in which case, you don’t need to use IAP. But if you offer paid upgrades from free accounts within the app, you are required to use IAP. Except for accounts that were created outside the app, which can offer paid account upgrades and don’t need to use IAP. If you’re selling “experiences” between people, you don’t need to use IAP. Unless those “experiences” include three or more people, or aren’t consumed live, in which case, you are required to use only IAP. If your purchase is for services, features, or game items, you are required to use only IAP. Unless you operate on multiple platforms, in which case, you can also offer purchasing outside the app. But you can’t tell anyone about it. Unless you get their contact info somewhere else, in which case, you can tell them about it, but not in the app. You are required to use IAP even if you sell your app or service directly to other people. Unless you only sell it to businesses or groups for their employees or students to use, in which case, you still must use IAP, but you can include your own payment method as well. Unless those groups are families, or unless those employees or students are somehow “consumers”, in which case, you must only use IAP. Do I have that right? *     *     * How about an alternative that’s clear, fair, reasonable, and consistently enforceable? Apps may offer other payment mechanisms in their app, as long as terms are clear and customers aren’t misled, and may or may not choose to implement in-app purchase based on its merits. In one stroke, antitrust and regulatory pressure disappear, developer relations are significantly repaired, and Apple can go back to spending its time, resources, PR, and political capital on making their products better and customers happier.",

    "title": "Introducing Voice Boost 2: Remaster your podcasts",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2020/01/31/voiceboost2",
    "description": "The latest update to Overcast includes a feature that I’m especially proud of that took over a year to build. Voice Boost 2 is an all-new audio engine that includes professional-grade, mastering-quality loudness normalization. When I first introduced Overcast in 2014, Voice Boost was one of its headlining features: Voice Boost is a combination of dynamic compression and equalization that can make many shows more listenable and normalize volume across all shows. This makes amateur-produced podcasts (including many of my favorites) more listenable in loud environments, like cars, where you’d otherwise need to crank the volume so loudly to hear the quiet parts that you’d blow your ears out when the loudest person spoke. Voice Boost 2 achieves the same goal as the original Voice Boost, but with dramatically more sophisticated methods, leading to more consistent results and much better sound quality. Goals When I wrote the original Voice Boost with only a rudimentary understanding of audio processing, it was a single configuration of Apple’s AudioUnits that applied a fixed set of parameters to all podcasts, regardless of their audio characteristics. It was an effective but blunt tool, relying on aggressive level compression and a strong EQ to make the compression less noticeable. Since then, I’ve edited over 500 podcasts, learned a lot more about how to master them properly, and developed a much better understanding of audio signal processing. I set out to develop a better, smarter, and more refined Voice Boost that took advantage of everything I’d learned, with these audio goals: The effect should be much more subtle: mostly just consistent volume, plus slightly smoother tone. It should analyze the input audio and apply just enough processing to achieve a consistent volume level, modifying already-good audio as little as possible. It should sound good, and consistent, regardless of the volume dynamics of its input. Quality should be so good that I can even play high-quality music through it1 and not notice any artifacts. And these technical goals: Like Smart Speed and the original Voice Boost, it had to work as a streaming process, easily toggled on and off at will, without needing to scan the entire file first or look very far ahead. The code had to be pure C, with highly optimized and vectorized code, so it wouldn’t be a major power drain on older phones and could potentially run on much lower-power devices as well. I had to write every component from scratch, without using AudioUnits, because I wanted to understand and control everything, ensure the highest performance and sound quality, and avoid Apple’s platform-specific API limits.2 It had to be modular and easily customizable, like a channel strip in an audio editor, so I could adjust the processing during development and testing, offer user customization down the road, and use the same engine to build myself a modular podcast-preproduction tool to save time in my weekly workflow (which I’ve been using for over a year).3 Live LUFS normalization Since Voice Boost is mostly about high-quality volume analysis and loudness normalization, I went straight to the top, implementing the ITU BS.1770–4 standard that gives us the LUFS measurement seen in high-end audio editors. Overcast now measures and adjusts podcast levels using this broadcast-standard perceptual loudness algorithm, at full quality, with no preprocessing. Voice Boost 2 normalizes all podcasts to –14 LUFS — a level I chose because it closely matches the volume of Siri and most iOS turn-by-turn navigation voices, so when you’re listening to a podcast while driving, navigation interruptions are less jarring. Most professionally produced podcasts are already mastered to similar volume levels, so Voice Boost 2 won’t overcompress them with aggressive processing — it’ll only apply as much correction as necessary to make them all the same volume. A brief tutorial on clipping and distortion This is about to get nerdier, but bear with me. (Yes, nerdier than ITU broadcast-loudness standards.) Given a loudness measurement for the incoming audio, quieter podcasts need to be amplified to reach the target. But perceived loudness isn’t the peak of the incoming audio stream — it’s more of an average. Quiet-sounding audio can still have brief moments of loud peaks. When increasing the volume of digital audio, the biggest challenge is not “clipping” during the peaks — not having any part of the signal pass above the volume ceiling of 0 dB. (It’s a negative scale. This is also why the LUFS value above, which is closely related to the decibel scale used here, is negative.) Here’s the highest the signal should go, showing the individual audio samples (green dots) that can be processed by a podcast app before the DAC transforms them into audio (smooth green line): It’ll sound right as long as the audio doesn’t cross above that top line (0 dB). Increase the volume even slightly too far, and some of the samples just slam into it and stay there, losing the tops of their smooth curves: And that sounds terrible. But I can’t just cap all the samples right below the limit and call it a day — that’s called a brickwall limiter — because then the shape of the audio line will actually represent different frequencies, telling the DAC to add noise that wasn’t really there. Here, the bottom of each image shows the frequency breakdown: The unclipped signal (left) shows only its original frequency of about 2100 Hz, but a basic brickwall limiter (right) results in the unwanted introduction of a bunch of extra frequencies. That’s distortion. (If this is interesting to you, learn more about audio sampling theory here.) Lookahead limiter Avoiding audible distortion requires a lookahead limiter, which looks… ahead (😎) at the audio coming down the pipeline, and smoothly ramps the volume amplification down as a loud peak is approaching, then back up again afterward, just enough to avoid clipping and audible distortion, but so quickly that you don’t notice.4 After Voice Boost 2’s complete 32-bit audio processing pipeline, the last stage is a lookahead limiter, configured such that it can’t clip, no matter what audio comes through. This gives vast flexibility in volume processing without sacrificing quality. Voice Boost 2 also incorporates a dynamics compressor, but over time, I’ve kept reducing its strength as I’ve found it less necessary. Proper LUFS processing with a great lookahead limiter provides excellent volume normalization with almost no compression needed afterward. True-peak detection There’s one more way to introduce clipping that needs to be guarded against. Digital audio is represented by samples that represent a point in time (green dots, again) on a sound wave (green line). But the sampled points don’t always land at the exact peaks of those waves: The most common way to measure the peak of a waveform is to find the greatest absolute sample value. By this method, the top waveform peaks here would measure about –6 dB and –1.5 dB, respectively. But the actual peak amplitudes of these waves is –1 dB! A simple limiter could still output clipped audio because it’s not seeing the true peaks. Voice Boost 2’s limiter performs true-peak detection, rather than simply measuring sample peaks, to avoid this type of clipping and further reduce distortion. Mastering-quality processing for everyone Voice Boost 2 is a mastering-quality audio-processing pipeline that applies broadcast-standard loudness normalization, light compression and EQ, and a true-peak lookahead limiter to your podcasts, in real time, without sacrificing quality or battery life. And it runs at less than 1% CPU usage on an iPhone SE.5 I intend to expose some of its customizability to customers in future updates, but I wanted to develop and ship the best default settings first to keep the app simple and usable to everyone. Now that it’s available to everyone, I may still subtly tweak the defaults in response to feedback. But as I’ve refined the settings during the beta period to be more universal, less customization has been necessary.6 Having achieved its goals of being more consistent and less aggressive, Voice Boost 2 is intentionally transparent. It’s not promoted more in the app or even labeled “Voice Boost 2”. It’s still Voice Boost — just better now. If I did my job well, you’ll hardly notice it at all. You’ll have no idea that your podcasts are being remastered in your pocket. But I’ll know. And the handful of you who really care will know. And that’s enough for me. Voice Boost 2 is in today’s update (2020.1), along with these new features: AirPlay 2: Overcast can now play to HomePods and other AirPlay 2 devices much more responsively, with full-blown Smart Speed and Voice Boost, on iOS 13.1 and above.7 Skip intros/outros: There’s a new per-podcast setting to skip a given number of seconds from the start and/or end of its episodes. Clip-sharing from private feeds. In retrospect, this restriction was unnecessary, so I lifted it. Restored iOS 12 compatibility. Going 13-only so soon was a mistake. Hear why on Under The Radar 181 and 183. As usual, all of this is free for everyone in Overcast. Those awesome Trey Anastasio acoustic shows are pretty quiet. ↩︎ Apple doesn’t make all of their audio APIs available on all platforms: some are Mac-only and never came to iOS, and watchOS has an even smaller subset than iOS. The more I can accomplish in my own code, the less I depend on Apple’s choices for which APIs they make available to developers. ↩︎ It’s just a command-line tool for now. You don’t want it. (But if you do… someday, maybe.) ↩︎ This all happens in milliseconds. ↩︎ At 1X, with Smart Speed enabled. Smart Speed was actually entirely rewritten as part of Voice Boost 2, but it’s less interesting. It performs the same job as before, but much more efficiently, and taking advantage of the measured loudness when Voice Boost is also enabled. ↩︎ For instance, I also built a de-esser into Voice Boost 2, but it slowly became unnecessary as I improved the other processing, so it’s not currently enabled. ↩︎ Smart Speed is a big deal here, I think — I’m not aware of any other podcast apps with silence-skipping over AirPlay 2. (Or LUFS normalization, or true-peak lookahead limiters.) ↩︎",

    "title": "Low Power Mode for Mac laptops: making the case again",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2020/01/13/macos-low-power-mode-redux",
    "description": "In light of today’s rumor that a Pro Mode may be coming that seems to offer benefits in the opposite direction,1 I wanted to re-make the case for a Low Power Mode on macOS — and explain why now is the time. Modern hardware constantly pushes thermal and power limits, trying to strike a balance that minimizes noise and heat while maximizing performance and battery life. Software also plays a role, trying to keep everything background-updated, content-indexed, and photo-analyzed so it’s ready for us when we want it, but not so aggressively that we notice any cost to performance or battery life. Apple’s customers don’t usually have control over these balances, and they’re usually fixed at design time with little opportunity to adapt to changing circumstances or customer priorities. The sole exception, Low Power Mode on iOS, seems to be a huge hit: by offering a single toggle that chooses a different balance, people are able to greatly extend their battery life when they know they’ll need it.2 Mac laptops need Low Power Mode, too. I believe so strongly in its potential because I’ve been using it on my laptops (in a way) for years, and it’s fantastic. I’ve been disabling Intel Turbo Boost on my laptops with Turbo Boost Switcher Pro most of the time since 2015. In 2018, I first argued for Low Power Mode on macOS with a list of possible tweaks, concluding that disabling Turbo Boost was still the best bang-for-the-buck tweak to improve battery life without a noticeable performance cost in most tasks.3 Recently, as Intel has crammed more cores and higher clocks into smaller form factors and pushed thermal limits to new extremes, the gains have become even more significant. Here’s some thermal testing from my 8-core 16-inch MacBook Pro: \u003c!-- .turboboosttable { margin: 2em auto; border-collapse: collapse; } .turboboosttable th, .turboboosttable td { text-align: center; border: 1px solid #f4f4f4; padding: 0.5em; } .turboboosttable th { width: 15%; } .turboboosttable th.lcol { text-align: right; } .turboboosttable th.notbold { font-weight: normal; } .turboboosttable th { background-color: #f4f4f4; } .turboboosttable .lightslash { opacity: 0.33; } .turboboosttable td.noturbo { background-color: #f8f8f8; } .turboboosttable .perfminus { color: #a00; } .turboboosttable .perfplus { color: #0a0; } --\u003e 16-inch MacBook Pro (Late 2019, 2.4 GHz 8-core i9)   Power Temp. Geekbench 5 single/multi xcodebuild Normal 82W 90°C 1260/7386 39 sec. No Turbo 31W−62% 65°C 669/5206−46/29% 62 sec.+59% With Turbo Boost disabled, peak CPU power consumption drops by 62%, with a correspondingly huge reduction in temperature. This has two massive benefits: The fans never audibly spin up. When Turbo Boost is enabled, the fans annoyingly spin up every time the system is under a heavy sustained load. Disable it, and it’s almost impossible to get them to be audible. It runs significantly cooler. Turbo Boost lets laptops get too hot to comfortably hold in your lap, and so much heat radiates out that it can make hands sweaty. Disable it, and the laptop only gets moderately warm, not hot, and hands stay comfortably dry. I haven’t done formal battery testing on the 16-inch, since it’s so difficult and time-consuming to do in a controlled way that’s actually useful to people, but anecdotally, I’m seeing similar battery gains by disabling Turbo Boost that I’ve seen with previous laptops: significantly longer battery life that I’d estimate to be between 30–50%. This comes at a cost to performance, but: It’s not noticeable on most workloads. Parallel workloads are affected far less than single-threaded tasks, and most modern heavy workloads are parallelized. This is an 8-core laptop that’s competitive with my iMac Pro! It’s much faster than most people need (myself included) most of the time, so I can spare some performance to get other benefits. A fast laptop isn’t very useful if your hands are too sweaty to type, the battery dies in the middle of a flight, or the loud fans ruin your audio recording. When I really want to maximize performance, Turbo Boost Switcher Pro lets me quickly toggle it in the menu bar, so switching between modes is easy. The vast majority of the time I’m using it, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a much better laptop with Turbo Boost disabled. It’s still fast enough to do everything I need (including significant development with Xcode), while remaining silent and cool, with incredible battery life. But soon, I bet I won’t be able to do this anymore. Turbo Boost Switcher Pro relies on a kernel extension that’s grandfathered into Apple’s latest security requirements, but it can never be updated — and when macOS Catalina loads it for the first time, it warns that it’ll be “incompatible with a future version of macOS.” I suspect that this is the last year I’ll get to run the latest OS and be able to turn off Turbo Boost at will, making all of my future laptop usage significantly worse. Please, Apple, make this feature official: give us a Low Power Mode for macOS that disables Turbo Boost to keep our laptops cool, quiet, and long-lasting at times when those are more important to us than speed. My guess is that “Pro Mode” doesn’t raise the peak performance, but instead raises the fan speeds to allow longer sustained operation at high Turbo Boost speeds. ↩︎ Low Power Mode has been so successful on iOS that Apple also thought it worthwhile to add a Low Data Mode to iOS 13, offering similar control over data usage. (Mac owners can get similar functionality with the excellent TripMode.) ↩︎ As I wrote back then, disabling discrete GPUs and Photos analysis are other obvious contributors to a good Mac Low Power Mode. ↩︎",

    "title": "The 16-inch MacBook Pro",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2019/11/13/mbp16",
    "description": "After my first day with the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, I’m very optimistic about it. 🎧  Hear more on today’s Accidental Tech Podcast! Two years ago, I wrote a wishlist to fix the MacBook Pro, and the 16-inch doesn’t actually deliver most of it. But time and technological progress are slowly getting Apple off the hook: The ports are unchanged. We’ll still need dongles. But USB-C is gradually becoming more common, and dongles are slowly — very slowly — getting less shitty. The Touch Bar isn’t optional. But a new hardware Esc key removes one of its biggest drawbacks, and accidental input should be reduced by the increased spacing between the Touch Bar and the top row of keys. The power brick still lacks its previous conveniences. There’s still no cable management, safety breakaway, or charging LED. But third parties are slowly filling some of these gaps. The headphone jack is still on the right (wrong) side, despite most single-sided headphone cables entering the left earcup. But the need for wired headphones is decreasing over time. Addressing those would be nice, but as I wrote then, they paled in comparison to one huge issue: the butterfly keyboard. The MacBook Pro must return to scissor keyswitches. If Apple only changes one thing about the next MacBook Pro, it should be this. It’s far more important than anything else on this list. […] The Magic Keyboard’s scissor switches feel similar, but with a bit more travel, and all of the reliability and resilience of previous keyboard generations. […] The Magic Keyboard only needs one change to be perfect for the MacBook Pro: returning to the “inverted-T” arrow-key arrangement by making the left- and right-arrow keys half-height again. This arrangement is much more natural and less error-prone because we can align our fingers by feeling the “T” shape, a crucial affordance for such frequently used keys that are so far from the home row. That’s exactly what they’ve done, and I couldn’t be happier. The new 16-inch MacBook Pro is a great computer in most other ways, but so were the MacBook Pros from the last few years. They were fast, powerful, capable workstations… but the butterfly keyboard took away from it all. Not anymore. I’m on cloud nine. Look at this glorious keyboard! An Esc key! Inverted-T arrow keys! A millimeter of key travel! Enough spacing between the keys for our fingers to accurately orient themselves! And keystrokes will probably work, 100% of the time, for years! Five years ago, nobody would’ve considered any of these noteworthy, and readers would’ve suspected you weren’t of sound mind if you included them in a review. Five years ago, laptop keyboards were fine. Everyone was pretty much satisfied with the ones they had, they worked, and we never had to talk or think about them. Today, finally, we begin heading back to that world. The butterfly keyboard was an anomaly — it was a huge departure from everything else we’d ever used, mostly not in good ways. The new keyboard is very similar to the recent desktop Magic Keyboard, and I expect it to have a wide appeal, just as the Magic Keyboard does. It has slightly less travel and spacing, but the overall feeling is very similar — and it’s nothing at all like the butterfly keyboard. I absolutely love it — not because it’s the most amazing keyboard in the world, but because it’s completely forgettable in the best possible way. It just feels normal again. There’s a lot more to love about the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The screen and battery are bigger, but the size and weight barely increased. It’s almost as fast as my iMac Pro, and the new thermals can sustain higher performance. The speakers and microphone got huge, unexpected improvements. And I didn’t get everything I wanted. But many of my wishlist items fall outside of what Apple is likely to ever do, and all of them are much less important than making the computer’s primary input device functional, acceptable, and reliable. Now we have the luxury of being able to complain about less-urgent wishes. The biggest change is that I finally don’t feel like it’s constantly fighting me. Its design doesn’t feel spiteful. It’s a computer that doesn’t seem to hate being a computer. I’m not afraid to use it in the world, and I’m not avoiding using it because it’s unpleasant. The butterfly keyboard was the opposite, it never got better, I never got used to it, and good riddance to it. Following in the footsteps of the fantastic iMac Pro, updated Mac Mini, and upcoming Mac Pro, the release of the 16-inch MacBook Pro ends a painful chapter of neglect and hubristic design of the Mac. Apple has finally turned the ship around. We haven’t had long enough to fully test it yet. There may be flaws or shortcomings discovered over time — there usually are (and always have been). But frankly, it could catch fire twice a week and it would still be my favorite laptop Apple has made since 2015. Fortunately, upon initial usage, nothing bad really jumps out. The new MacBook Pro has no massive asterisks or qualifications. It’s a great computer, period, and it feels so good to be able to say that again. For the first time in years, without any major exceptions, we can see that Apple loves computers as much as we do. 🎧  Much more detail and discussion in the podcast!",

    "description": "Today’s Overcast update (2019.6) brings some great new features. But first, I need to set low expectations for iOS 13, watchOS 6, and macOS Catalina updates this fall. Halfway through the summer, I’ve made much less progress than expected, having been overwhelmed by the required OS changes, my own technical and design debts, and unusually rough betas. Rather than shipping a big iOS update, a standalone Watch app, and a Mac app on day one, these will probably come incrementally over the next year. Fortunately, I haven’t stopped improving the app in the meantime. Per-podcast customization, longer clips You can now set download-vs.-stream and auto-delete behavior per podcast, one of the most frequently requested features over the last few years. (Sorry it took so long — it required a lot of server-side work for uninteresting reasons.) I’ve also raised the clip-sharing length limit to 90 seconds. When I debuted this feature, I had to guess how it would be used and received, and 60 seconds seemed like a good limit. In practice, that’s sometimes a bit too short to capture a complete thought. 90 seconds should be better — most clips won’t need to be that long, but it’ll be nice to have the headroom when you need it. “Suggestions for You” replacing Twitter Overcast has had a Twitter-powered social-recommendations feature since version 1.0 in 2014, which made sense at the time: I didn’t have any popularity data to generate recommendations from, and social networks were nicer places to be than they are today. But after five years, only 10% of active users have connected a Twitter account in Overcast, and only 0.2% of new podcast subscriptions have actually been added via Twitter recommendations. Not only was the feature not providing much value to the 10% of people who enabled it, but the other 90% of Overcast’s customers haven’t been getting personalized recommendations at all. In the meantime, I’ve accumulated five years of popularity data, so I tried writing my own recommendation engine. It worked — and it’s better. Overcast now offers its own data-driven recommendation engine, and I’ve removed Twitter integration entirely. Podcasts in the new “Suggestions for You” section of the Add Podcast screen are based on the shows you subscribe to, and what else their subscribers subscribe to, which gives much better recommendations without involving any social networks. Most importantly, it works for all of Overcast’s customers. *     *     * As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Give it a try.",

    "title": "Apple is Listening",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2019/06/09/apple-is-listening",
    "description": "Something big changed at Apple around the beginning of 2017. They had encountered significant turbulence in the product line over the preceding years, especially Macs. It was a rough time to be a pro Mac user. The “trash can” 2013 Mac Pro addressed only a fraction of the needs solved by the previous “cheese grater” towers, aged quickly without critical upgrade paths, and suffered from high GPU-failure rates from its cooling solution — all because its design prioritized size and appearance over performance and versatility in the one Mac model that should never make that tradeoff. Over the next few years, it became clear that the Mac Pro was an embarrassing, outdated flop that Apple seemed to have little intention of ever updating, leaving its customers feeling unheard and abandoned. I think Apple learned a small lesson from it, but they learned a much bigger one a few years later. The current MacBook Pro generation launched in late 2016, and I think Apple was truly caught completely by surprise when the new Touch Bar, sparse USB-C-only port offerings, high prices, and highly polarizing butterfly keyboard were met with harsh criticism, mixed reviews, and high failure rates. This one really hurt: while the Mac Pro is a niche machine for the highest-end and most-specialized needs, the popular MacBook Pro is the lifeblood of the Mac. By the end of 2016, in addition to the generally buggy, neglected state macOS seemed to be perpetually stuck in, Apple had replaced its entire “pro” Mac lineup with controversial, limiting products that seemed optimized to flex Apple’s industrial-design muscles rather than actually addressing their customers’ needs. The only company that can make computers for our OS seemed incapable of making good computers anymore. Each update threatened to remove or break things we needed or loved. Their newest designs felt punitive, rather than feeling like a celebration of computing. Then, in April 2017, out of nowhere, Apple held a Mac Pro roundtable discussion with the press to announce that they were in the early stages of completely redesigning the Mac Pro.1 The follow-up briefing a year later promised that the new Mac Pro would be released in 2019, and publicized the existence of a “Pro Workflow Team” of real pro users working inside Apple to inform the direction of their pro hardware and software. It sounded like they’d gone from not listening to their customers at all to an institutionalized process of listening. And the newly designed Macs released since then have been great.2 The late-2017 iMac Pro, which I’m using to write this, is the best Mac I’ve ever owned by far. It’s versatile, incredibly powerful, beautiful, and silent. It’s so good that I’ll probably never really need a Mac Pro again,3 and if this was the only new “Mac Pro”, I’d be mostly fine with that. The late-2018 Mac Mini replaced a pitiful, punitive, neglected relic with a practical, powerful mini-Mac-Pro. Apple could’ve let it die, or replaced it with a tiny, no-port marvel of uselessness, but instead, they made a computer so good that I started and ended a YouTube mini-career just to review it. And the 2019 Mac Pro, finally unveiled last week, looks to be absolutely killer — it’s the first true successor to the tower Mac Pro, which saw its last real update almost a decade ago in 2010.4 It’s big, bulky, ludicrously fast, and almost obscenely upgradeable — exactly what a Mac Pro needs to be, and far better than any of us expected. The new Mac Pro is, truly, a celebration of computing. Even more importantly than any hardware releases, macOS itself has also seen massive engineering effort recently. For the first time in a decade, the Mac was a major focus of WWDC, with great new APIs poised to usher in a huge wave of fresh software. To be fair, this story hasn’t ended yet. The Mac Pro isn’t actually out yet (and will be very expensive), they still need to resolve the problematic MacBook Pro with its next generation (rumors are promising), and the lack of standalone Apple displays under six thousand dollars really hurts the Mac Pro story.5 But I’m optimistic for the first time in years. It’s hard to tell when Apple is listening. They speak concisely, infrequently, and only when they’re ready, saying absolutely nothing in the meantime, even when we’re all screaming about a product line as if it’s on fire. They make great progress, but often with courageous losses that never get reversed, so an extended silence because we’re stuck with a change forever is indistinguishable from an extended silence because the fix isn’t ready yet. But there has clearly been a major shift in direction for the better since early 2017, and they couldn’t be more clear now: Apple is listening again, they’ve still got it, and the Mac is back. Based on what we’ve learned since, they had likely started the project a very short time before holding the roundtable. ↩︎ I’m excluding the 2018 MacBook Air because it feels like a stopgap that wasn’t originally planned to exist — the no-Touch-Bar 13” MacBook “Escape” seemed intended to replace it — that was rushed into the 2016-era generation mid-cycle, rather than being the first of a new design. Even so, with the large exception of the butterfly keyboard, it’s quite good. ↩︎ This doesn’t necessarily mean I won’t buy one. ↩︎ The 2010/“2012” Mac Pro was so good, and so upgradeable, that it’s still in surprisingly widespread use today for needs that weren’t possible or compelling on the “trashcan” successor. ↩︎ And the MacBook Pro. A very common setup for developers — Apple’s largest identified segment of pro users — is a 15” MacBook Pro connected to an external monitor, for which a good solution no longer exists. Developers would be much better served by a $1,500-ish standalone version of the iMac’s 5K display than a $6,000 XDR reference monitor for professional video colorists. ↩︎",

    "title": "Clip sharing with Overcast",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2019/04/27/overcast-clip-sharing",
    "description": "Sharing podcasts has never been easy, but I’ve always tried to lead the way with Overcast, with publicly shareable episode links and optional recommendations from your Twitter friends since version 1.0 in 2014. Podcast sharing has been limited to audio and links, but today’s social networks are more reliant on images and video, especially Instagram. Podcasts need video clips to be shared more easily today. I’ve seen some video clips from tools specific to certain podcast networks or hosts, but they were never available to everyone, or for every show. So people mostly just haven’t shared podcast clips, understandably, because it has been too hard. Not anymore. ▶️ ↩️ This remark on Unco by Stephen Hackett inspired me to finally solve this problem in a way that worked easily, for all podcasts, for both podcasters and listeners to use. With today’s 2019.4 update1, you can now share audio or video clips, up to a minute each, from any public podcast. Simply tap the share button in the upper-right corner. You can generate an audio clip, or portrait, landscape, or square video, using your current Overcast theme setting. In order to help spread podcasts further, I didn’t want to be heavy-handed in the Overcast branding — not everyone wants to advertise for one specific podcast app when promoting their shows. So the “Shared with Overcast” badge is optional, and if you’d like, you can also add an Apple Podcasts badge. Finally, I wanted to extend the same app-agnosticism to Overcast’s share links. While this design still needs a lot of modernization, I’ve done a small refresh: Now, for non-logged-in visitors, Overcast’s public sharing pages display badges for other podcast apps and the RSS feed for any podcast listed in Apple Podcasts. It’s important for me to promote other apps like this, and to make it easy even for other people’s customers to benefit from Overcast’s sharing features, because there are much bigger threats than letting other open-ecosystem podcast apps get a few more users. For podcasting to remain open and free, we must not leave major shortcomings for proprietary, locked-down services to exploit.2 Conversely, the more we strengthen the open podcast ecosystem with content, functionality, and ease of use, the larger the barrier becomes that any walled garden must overcome to be compelling. One of the most common shortcomings we hear is that podcasts are hard to share. Hopefully, Overcast’s new clip-sharing feature changes that, and other apps build similar features soon. So go get Overcast and start sharing your favorite moments. It’ll help me, of course, but more importantly, it’ll help your favorite shows gain listeners, and it’ll strengthen the amazing, open, standards-based world of podcasting. Like Slopes and Castro, I’ve changed to a date-based version-numbering scheme — 2019.4 is the fourth update released in 2019, the next version will be 2019.5, and so on — partly because version numbers don’t really matter anymore, but mostly because I no longer wanted to delay completed features until a major-version change or worry that I didn’t do enough to justify a certain number. ↩︎ YouTube was able to dominate video because it made everything easy in a medium that (at the time) was very hard to do elsewhere. If a proprietary service takes a very hard aspect of podcasting and makes it very easy, it may rapidly rise to prominence. Other major shortcomings I’m concerned about: the difficulty of getting sponsorships for small shows (“AdSense for podcasts”), and the complexity of creation and publishing (“Tumblr for podcasts”). This is probably why Spotify bought Anchor. ↩︎",

    "description": "▶️ The first thing someone does in a podcast app is add some podcasts, and most active Overcast users add at least two new podcasts each month. Over 80% of podcasts are added to Overcast by searching, with the vast majority as searches for a specific podcast by name (rather than searching for generic keywords, such as “business”). Good search is a critical, differentiating feature of any podcast app. I’m not satisfied if the podcast you’re looking for is somewhere in the middle of a long list — I want it to be the first one, displayed quickly, after typing the fewest characters possible. I’ve been building toward this by analyzing years of popularity statistics and anonymous search data. Instant Search is the next step in Overcast’s search evolution. It combines a small local cache with a highly optimized search service to give the most relevant results immediately as you type, even after only a single letter.1 It’s a dramatic, delightful improvement to a critical, frequently used feature. This was a lot of fun to build, and I’m proud of it. See for yourself! Overcast is free on the App Store. If Instant Search isn’t instant right after you update, the cache hasn’t fully downloaded yet. It’s downloaded weekly, only on Wi-Fi, and is less than 5 MB. ↩︎",

Until last week, I thought it would be the last Mac Mini that Apple ever made. And when rumors started swirling about an imminent Mac Mini update, I assumed the worst: if it came at all, it would be a tiny box with a slow, ultra-low-power processor and almost zero ports, optimizing for small size instead of versatility. I don’t think this was an unreasonable fear after the 2014 Mac Mini update, which made many key aspects much worse without making anything much better. It seemed clear then, and for the following four years that it went without an update, that Apple held the Mac Mini and its customers in very low regard. Not anymore. The 2018 Mac Mini is real, and it’s spectacular. It makes almost nothing worse and almost everything better, finally bringing the Mac Mini into the modern age. Ports! Glorious ports! Number one — and this is a big one these days, especially for this product — is that it’s not any less useful or versatile than the outgoing Mac Mini, including the generous assortment of ports. If the previous one served a role for you, the new one can probably do it just as well, and probably better and faster, with minimal donglage.2 It’s the same size as the old one, which is the right tradeoff. I know zero Mac Mini owners who really need it to get smaller, and many who don’t want it to get fewer ports or worse performance. The point of the Mac Mini is to be as versatile as possible, addressing lots of diverse and edge-case needs that the other Macs can’t with their vastly different form factors and more opinionated designs. The Mac Mini needs to be a utility product, not a design statement. (Although, even as someone tired of space-gray everything, I have to admit that the Mini looks fantastic in its new color.) The base price has increased to $800, and that’s not great. It’s partly justifiable because it’s much higher-end than before — the processors are much better, the architecture is higher-end and includes big advances like the T2, and all-SSD is standard — but it’s still an expensive product in absolute terms. Apple lent me a high-end configuration for review — 6-core i7, 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD — which would cost $2499 (much of which is the SSD). This would’ve sounded crazy to spend on a Mac Mini a few years ago, but when it’s specced up like this, it’s targeting a much higher-end market than the previous model could. Compared to similarly specced iMacs and MacBook Pros, the pricing is generally reasonable. And this can truly be a pro desktop, with just one exception. Benchmarks The big story to me is how incredibly fast this thing is. Granted, I’m testing the fastest CPU offered, but damn. Geekbench results are very strong. The i7 Mac Mini scored better on single-core performance than every other Mac today (!) at 5912, and its multi-core score of nearly 24,740 beats every Mac to date except the iMac Pro and the old 12-core 2013 Mac Pro. “Performance-competitive with pro Macs” was not high on my prediction list for a Mac Mini update, but here we are. As the rate of CPU advancement has slowed dramatically over the last few years, Apple has found other ways to improve performance. The T2 is great for lots of security reasons — I wouldn’t buy a new Mac these days without it — but what you’re seeing here is its strength as a ridiculously fast SSD controller. This Mac Mini builds my app, Overcast, much faster than my maxed-out 13-inch MacBook Pro, and about as quickly as my 10-core iMac Pro! Obviously, to achieve this result with only 6 cores, it’s not maxing out the CPU 100% of the time — it hits it in bursts while juggling a lot between the SSD and memory — but the result is that it’s incredibly fast as a development machine. The Blackmagick Disk Speed Test shows that the raw SSD performance is effectively identical to the other T2 Macs shipped to date, and a huge improvement over the four-year-old Mac Mini. A lot of people use Mac Minis as media or Plex servers, so I ran an H.265 transcoding test with ffmpeg. This maxes out all CPU cores, so the results predictably scale with the core count: the 6-core Mac Mini was much faster than the 4-core MacBook Pro, but the 10-core iMac Pro beat them both. But if an app supports the T2’s hardware HEVC encoder,3 it can go much faster. And since every T2 so far performs identically, all T2 machines — from the 2018 MacBook Air to the iMac Pro — encode HEVC this way at the same speed, and all in complete silence because they’re barely touching the CPU. I wasn’t able to notice any quality differences between the videos encoded with x265 and the T2’s hardware acceleration. The only spec that lets it down is the Intel GPU. It’s fast enough for common tasks, but if your workload benefits from a strong GPU, you’re better off going for an iMac or a 15-inch MacBook Pro, or considering an eGPU setup. Many Mac lines rely on Intel’s integrated GPUs to fit their physical and thermal needs, and Intel has been incredibly inconsistent over the last few years in delivering updated CPU-GPU combinations that would be suitable for many Macs. We often blame Intel’s CPU roadmap (or Apple’s seeming indifference) for the lack of updates to certain Mac lines, but Intel’s GPU offerings are often the bigger issue. This is Intel’s fault, but it’s Apple’s problem — and Apple passes that problem right along to its customers. But that’s it — aside from price, that’s the only downside. The GPU sucks. Everything else is awesome. If you don’t need a strong GPU — and honestly, most Mac Mini use-cases don’t — this is a solid pick for a general-purpose Mac, even at the base-level configuration. Spec it up, and it’s more like a mini-Mac Pro. A few assorted notes, with apologies for stealing Gruber’s format: It’s silent at idle. The i7’s fan noise does become clearly audible when it’s under heavy load: it’s in the ballpark of a modern MacBook Pro, but quieter. Interestingly, I disabled Turbo Boost to simulate the base i3 model’s thermals, and couldn’t get the fan to spin up audibly, no matter what I did. Those who prioritize silence under heavy loads should probably stick with the i3. This is the first non-iMac desktop Mac that lets you plug in a 5K display, at full quality, without dual cables or other unreliable hacks. We finally have 5K Retina Mac options beyond the iMac! Unfortunately, we still don’t have any great standalone 5K displays. (The LG UltraFine isn’t.) You can upgrade the RAM again! I never would’ve guessed this was coming, and I believe it’s the first time in a long time that an Apple product’s direct successor became more upgradeable and serviceable. I still recommend getting it with the right amount of RAM from Apple if possible, since third-party RAM has historically been a mess of unreliability and finger-pointing, but if you need that, it’s back. (The security screws inside — TR6? — still need some iFixit tools to get past.) I Can’t Believe The Mac Mini Is This Awesome, I Can’t Even Say “Again” Because It Never Was A new Mac Mini could’ve been so much worse. At many times in its past, it has seemed unloved, neglected, and downright punitive — a similar pattern to Apple’s other headless desktop, the Mac Pro. It seemed for a while that Apple lacked any interest in making Macs anymore, especially desktops. Last year, with the introduction of the absolutely stellar iMac Pro, Apple showed us a glimpse of a potential new direction. It was downright perfect — a love letter to the Mac and its pro desktop users, and a clear turnaround in the way the company views the Mac for the better. We didn’t know until now whether the iMac Pro’s greatness was a fluke. But now we have another data point: the last two desktops out of Apple have been incredible. After this, I have faith that they’re going to do the new Mac Pro justice when it finally ships next year. The new Mac Mini is a great update, out of nowhere, to a product we thought would never be updated again. Of course, with Apple’s track record on the Mac Mini, it may never be updated after this. This is either the first in a series of regular updates with which Apple proves that they care about the Mac Mini again, or it’s the last Mac Mini that will ever exist and we’ll all be hoarding them in a few years. We can’t know yet. But today, this is a great update, a wonderful all-arounder for lots of potential needs, and just a fantastic little computer. I do this via iSCSI, but I wouldn’t recommend it. It breaks and requires a new $200+ iSCSI initiator with almost every macOS update — which is why my Mac Mini still runs Sierra. In the near future, I’ll just directly attach some giant external hard drives to the Mac Mini and stop using the NAS. ↩︎ Unless you used optical audio, audio input, or the SD-card reader. (Shit, I use optical in and out.) ↩︎ ffmpeg can do it by specifying -c:v hevc_videotoolbox instead of -c:v x265. I also needed -vtag hvc1 for the output MP4s with either codec to be playable on macOS. Compressor uses the T2’s HEVC acceleration when encoding 8-bit HEVC, but not 10-bit. ↩︎",

If that took you a bit longer than usual to tell the time on the Apple Watch’s new default Infograph face, you’re not alone: John Gruber finds it “far too busy” Jason Snell finds it “pretty and packed with features”, but misses hour numerals Zac Hall removes almost everything to improve legibility David Smith wrote his own complications (!) to improve contrast I’ve configured mine acceptably, but Utility is still far more legible for telling the time at a quick glance: Infograph, Utility Infograph suffers from two major issues: The center complications reduce the contrast between the dial and hands, often making the hands hard to locate. This is avoidable with customization, although the defaults should be much more conservative. It takes too much cognitive effort (and therefore time) to distinguish the current hour. This is simply a flawed design. It’s faster and easier to read analog time with the 1–12 numerals displayed on a watch, but many people prefer the cleaner look of a watch that uses lines, dots, or other shapes as hour markers instead. (Watch people call these “indices”.) And it’s absolutely possible to design a highly legible dial with hour indices in many different styles. Here are some classics and modern takes:1 Across a wide variety of brands, styles, and price points, a few key design principles are clear: The hour markers for 12 (and often 3/6/9) are more prominent. The hour indices are much larger than the minute markings. The hour hands nearly touch the hour indices. These all improve legibility by making it as fast and easy as possible to know which hour is being indicated (and minimize the chance of an off-by-one error), first by orienting your eyes to the current rotation with the 12 marker, then by minimizing the distance between the hour hand and the indices it’s between. Apple Watch’s analog faces all fail to achieve these principles:2 Color, Simple, Explorer Color, Simple, and Explorer have easily distinguished hour markers, but Explorer’s are a bit too far from its hour hand. None of them have distinguished 12 markers to aid in orientation. While Explorer omits minute markings altogether, Simple bafflingly uses 30-second markings in place of its minute track, making time-telling even harder. I’ve never seen another watch with sub-minute markings identical to its minute markings. Activity Analog, Utility, and Infograph without most complications Activity Analog’s hour markers are faint and far from its hour hand, and the central activity rings quickly eliminate the hands’ contrast against the dial as they progress. Utility (when configured without numbers) improves legibility slightly with its bold hour indices, but they’re still too small and too far from its hour hand, and there’s no differentiation for the 12 index. Infograph is similar, but even worse: its hour indices are more faint, it uses 30-second markings instead of minute markings, and its default Calendar display wipes out the top three indices. (At least you can tell which way is up.) Even with almost no complications, the basic essence of the Infograph dial has poor time legibility. When it’s being used as Apple seems to intend, time-telling at a glance is so difficult that many people have actually suggested setting the digital time as the center complication, at which point the hands are just a nuisance and we should stop pretending it’s an analog face. It’s great for Apple to offer a wide variety of Apple Watch faces, but most of them are short-lived novelties at best. We’re three years and four generations into the Apple Watch, and almost every Watch owner I know still uses the same handful of “good” faces. If you want digital time with a good deal of complications, Modular is your only good choice (or Infograph Modular on the Series 4).3 If you want analog time with numerals, Utility is the only good option. If you want indices instead of numerals — probably the most popular analog watch style in the world — I don’t think there is a good option. By now, we’ve seen Apple’s design range that they’re willing to ship as Watch faces, and while it seems broad at first glance, it’s actually pretty narrow. And we’re restricted to the handful of good watch faces that Apple makes, because other developers aren’t allowed to make custom Watch faces. The Apple Watch is an amazing feat of technology. It’s a computer. It can display anything. With no mechanical or physical limitations to hold us back, any watch-face design from anyone could plausibly be built, enabling a range of creativity, style, and usefulness that no single company could ever design on its own. But they won’t let us. In a time when personal expression and innovation in watch fashion should be booming, they’re instead being eroded, as everyone in the room is increasingly wearing the same watch with the same two faces. Open this door, Apple. You can even see which model the Apple Watch’s hand shape comes from, which is not a coincidence. ↩︎ For Apple Watch faces offering multiple hour/minute styles, I selected the best one that didn’t have hour numerals, and most complications were disabled. ↩︎ Special shout-out to my favorite digital face, Solar. ↩︎",

Busy day. It all started with the watchOS volume widget. You see, Overcast’s previous Apple Watch app really sucked. I did my best with the capabilities of watchOS 1–4, but I couldn’t give people what they really wanted: Standalone podcast playback on the Apple Watch without an iPhone. I briefly offered it through some bad hacks, but had to remove it. Volume control on the Watch, which is increasingly important with the popularity of AirPods. That’s why I nearly jumped for joy during the watchOS 5 announcement in June, when Apple unveiled most of my list of watchOS changes needed to make good podcast apps. After a very busy summer, standalone Apple Watch playback is back in Overcast, and it’s actually good this time! It’s not perfect: No cellular. Apple hasn’t released a good way to do cellular audio streaming in watchOS, and the bad ways wouldn’t be very useful. Sending podcasts to the Watch is slow. Overcast shrinks them to reduce the transfer time, but when (and how quickly) podcasts transfer is tightly controlled by watchOS to preserve battery life. Transfers still sometimes wait forever or silently fail. Programmers like me can’t accept that something is just slow, so I’ve decided to make transfer speed irrelevant. Nobody cares how slowly podcasts transfer if it happens while they’re asleep! Auto-Sync to Watch automatically tries to send your most recent podcasts to your Apple Watch whenever it gets a chance.1 You can still send episodes manually from the queue button on an episode (≡+), but in my testing, I never needed to. Just pick up your Watch and go, and it’ll already have plenty of podcasts for your outing, all without having to manually sync anything or wait for slow transfers. The Overcast 5.0.1 update, due out in a few days, makes Watch transfers even more reliable. (Sorry. Found a better way after 5.0 was approved.) And Watch-crown volume control! Finally, the best way to use Overcast from your Apple Watch isn’t to delete it, letting the Now Playing app show up instead. That’s where the other half of my summer workload began. The watchOS volume widget offers minimal customization: just the color of the circle. I couldn’t make the line width a little narrower to match the rest of Overcast’s thin-line aesthetic. But that iOS 7-era thin-line aesthetic looked dated, and I’d wanted a design refresh for a while. I decided to start modernizing the app’s design, screen by screen. I couldn’t do it all in one summer, so I started with the screen that needed the most help: Now Playing. The previous Now Playing screen in Overcast 4. The biggest problem of the previous design was the center artwork area, a scrollable set of “pages” that had speed and effects controls offscreen to the left, and the episode notes offscreen to the right. Nobody ever found them. I’ve been getting emails almost every day from people asking where the speed controls were because they set them once and couldn’t find them again, or saying how they’d really like my app more if it offered speed controls. The only indication in the interface was three “page dots” below the scrollable area, but that wasn’t enough. The new design maintains the same scrollable pages, but now as obvious, tactile cards. In my testing, everyone figured these out immediately. Put differently, it’s like you’re navigating this through a phone-shaped window in the middle: This design is not only more discoverable, but it allows me to fit more controls on screen, and in more reachable areas. Unlike the previous design, I can also fit the same controls on all devices, from the iPhone SE to the iPad Pro. Designing a good Now Playing screen for a music or podcast app that’s nice, clean, and highly discoverable is incredibly difficult. I think I’ve finally found a good balance. I’ve given chapters (when present) their own card with durations and inline progress bars. I’ve also finally revamped the sleep timer to ditch the ugly alert sheet, give it a proper UI for fast input, and show the remaining time in more useful ways: There are lots of other improvements throughout the app as well. Some of the highlights: Search your podcasts and current episodes from the main screen, or go into a podcast’s screen to search its entire archive. Refreshed the podcast screen a little. (More to come.) Siri Shortcuts support, of course. Plus smaller fixes and improvements: CarPlay performance is much better, especially for people with large collections. Podcasts now display their estimated release frequency (daily, weekly, etc.) if it can be inferred. Tap-to-load on images now loads all images from the same domain at once. Tons of bug fixes and performance improvements. Overcast 5 requires iOS 12 and watchOS 5, and as always, it’s free. Update your devices, then go get Overcast! Up to 20 episodes are auto-synced today. This number will change as I refine the balance of resource usage. Auto-Sync to Watch is on by default and can be turned off in Nitpicky Details. ↩︎",

    "title": "Low Power Mode on the Mac",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2018/07/31/mac-low-power-mode",
    "description": "Laptop battery life is decreasingly relevant to me as more airplanes offer power outlets. But sometimes you lose that lottery, as I did on my latest 8-hour daytime flight. Apple’s “Up to 10 hours” claim doesn’t apply to my work,1 which is usually a mix of Xcode, web browsing, and social time-wasting, so I knew I’d have to seriously conserve power. Sometimes, you just need Low Power Mode: the switch added to iOS a few years ago to conserve battery life when you need it, at the expense of full performance and background tasks. There’s no such feature on Mac laptops, but there should be. It could: Disable the discrete GPU on 15-inch models unless required for hardware reasons2 Pause Photos syncing and analysis Pause Spotlight indexing Reduce the frequency of Time Machine backups Don’t download or install software updates Don’t download new content in iTunes Auto-dim the screen after a shorter time Let third-party apps detect Low Power Mode and reduce their background operations to only essential work And the big one: Reduce the processor’s maximum wattage or disable Turbo Boost Back in 2015, I experimented with disabling Turbo Boost and discovered that it reduced performance by about a third, but also boosted battery life by almost as much. Since then, I’ve been running Turbo Boost Switcher Pro to automatically disable Turbo Boost when I’m running on battery power, and it has been wonderful: I made it through that 8-hour flight only because Turbo Boost was off. Over the last few days, I’ve run battery tests on my 2018 13-inch MacBook Pro with the (awesome) 2.7 GHz i7 and my 2015 2.2 GHz 15-inch3 to see how far I could push the battery life using Volta, which can disable Turbo Boost and/or set wattage limits on the CPU. My test was based on the “Heavy” script from last time, but using xcodebuild every few minutes with Overcast’s current codebase (which is larger and includes some Swift). Improvements are in green and performance reductions are in red: \u003c!-- .turboboosttable { margin: 2em auto; border-collapse: collapse; } .turboboosttable th, .turboboosttable td { text-align: center; border: 1px solid #f4f4f4; padding: 0.5em; } .turboboosttable th { width: 15%; } .turboboosttable th.lcol { text-align: right; } .turboboosttable th.notbold { font-weight: normal; } .turboboosttable th { background-color: #f4f4f4; } .turboboosttable .lightslash { opacity: 0.33; } .turboboosttable td.noturbo { background-color: #f8f8f8; } .turboboosttable .perfminus { color: #a00; } .turboboosttable .perfplus { color: #0a0; } --\u003e 15-inch 2015 MacBook Pro (2.2 GHz quad-core i7)   Battery life Geekbench single/multi xcodebuild Normal 3:36 3963/13864 43.9s No Turbo 5:06+42% 2796/9917−29/28% 63.4s+44% 13-inch 2018 MacBook Pro (2.7 GHz quad-core i7)   Battery life Geekbench single/multi xcodebuild Normal 3:09 5412/18983 34.3s 28W 3:28+10% 5401/16326−0/14% 37.4s+9% 18W 4:05+29% 5248/14133−3/26% 43.5s+27% 12W 4:44+50% 4818/11835−11/38% 48.2s+41% No Turbo 5:05+61% 3624/13324−33/30% 48.9s+43% 6W 6:24+103% 4065/7596−25/60% 76.1s+121% It’s impressive how much faster this new 13-inch model is than the best laptop ever made due to significant CPU and SSD improvements. Dropping the wattage to 6W, the thermal limit of the fanless 12-inch MacBook, interestingly (but not surprisingly) makes it perform effectively identically to the best 12-inch MacBook in Geekbench. This is an extreme option, but one I’d occasionally take if offered. It roughly doubles compilation times, but also doubles the battery life. This ratio holds for most other configurations: the gain in battery life is about as large as the loss in heavy-workload performance. That’s a trade-off I’d gladly make when I need to maximize runtime. The best bang-for-the-buck option is still to just disable Turbo Boost. Single-threaded performance hurts more than with wattage-limiting, but it’s able to maintain better multi-threaded performance and more consistent thermals, and gets a larger battery gain relative to its performance loss. And Volta, which offers both wattage limits and Turbo disabling, requires disabling System Integrity Protection to install an unsigned kernel extension, which I really don’t recommend. Turbo Boost Switcher, which doesn’t offer wattage control, works with SIP using a signed extension and its Pro version has more convenient features for automatic toggling. For now, I’m going to continue to happily run Turbo Boost Switcher Pro to selectively give myself better battery life, and I recommend it for anyone else with the same need. But what I ultimately want is for a true Low Power Mode built into macOS that could provide this sort of CPU throttling and software changes, which would ultimately achieve even greater gains. Whose work does get 10 hours out of a MacBook Pro? None of the use-cases on the marketing page — Photography, Coding, Video Editing, 3D Graphics, and Gaming — are likely to achieve even half of that in practice. ↩︎ I’ve heard that 15-inch models are wired such that the discrete GPU is required when external displays are connected. Otherwise, whether it’s used or not is a software decision, and gfxCardStatus can override it in certain conditions. ↩︎ It’s not brand new, so it’s not a perfect comparison, but the battery only had 90 cycles before this test. ↩︎",

    "title": "Overcast 4.2: The privacy update",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2018/04/27/overcast42",
    "description": "Overcast 4.2 is out now. It enhances privacy in two major areas: Anonymous sync by default Overcast has offered anonymous sync accounts since 2014. They’re fully functional, but they lack email addresses or passwords, so they can’t log into the website. A login token is stored in iCloud so the account can be accessed after a restore or upgrade, or from other devices you own. Previously, the login screen pushed email logins. But with four years of perspective, feedback, and usage data, I now think that’s the wrong move. Only a single-digit percentage of customers use the website, and the iCloud token-sync method solves cross-device logins for almost everyone. Your personal data isn’t my business — it’s a liability. I want as little as possible. I don’t even log IP addresses anymore. If I don’t need your email address, I really don’t want it. 68% of Overcast accounts have email addresses today. To reduce that as much as possible, I’ve made major changes to account handling: The previous login screen (left) and the new one. In Overcast 4.2, the login screen now prominently encourages anonymous accounts by default. If you already have an account in iCloud, it’ll pop up a dialog box over this screen asking if you want to use it. And the first time you launch 4.2, people with email-based accounts will be encouraged to migrate them to anonymous accounts: The migration prompt that shows on the first run. Finally, you can now change your account between email-based and anonymous whenever you want. Blocking ad-tracking images In most podcast apps, podcasts are downloaded automatically in the background. The only data sent to a podcast’s publisher about you or your behavior is your IP address and the app’s name. The IP address lets them derive your approximate region, but not much else. They don’t know exactly who you are, whether you listened, when you listened, how far you listened, or whether you skipped certain parts. Some large podcast producers are trying very hard to change that. I’m not. Big data ruined the web, and I’m not going to help bring it to podcasts. Publishers already get enough from Apple to inform ad rates and make content decisions — they don’t need more data from my customers. Podcasting has thrived, grown, and made tons of money for tons of people under the current model for over a decade. We already have all the data we need. One of the ways publishers try to get around the limitations of the current model is by embedding remote images or invisible “tracking pixels” in each episode’s HTML show notes. When displayed in most apps, the images are automatically loaded from an analytics server, which can then record and track more information about you. In Overcast 4.2, much like Mail (and for the same reason), remote images don’t load by default. A tappable placeholder shows you where each image will load from, and you can decide whether to load it or not. I believe I’ve done this in the most secure way possible — I’m actually displaying the show notes using a strict Content Security Policy — and I would love to hear from anyone who finds a way to inject auto-loading remote images or execute arbitrary JavaScript in show notes. Bug fixes Overcast 4.2 also includes a bunch of minor fixes, and two big ones: Fixed the major slowdowns and high battery usage that resulted from extremely large podcast artwork. Password-protected episodes are now supported on password-protected feeds. Get it now in the App Store!",

    "description": "Overcast 4.1 is now in the App Store with some small but nice new features. Smart Resume is actually two features: It jumps back by up to a few seconds after having been paused to help remind you of the conversation. It slightly adjusts resumes and seeks to fall in the silences between spoken words when reasonably possible. Both are subtle but noticeable benefits (my favorite kind), especially when you’re being interrupted a lot, such as while following turn-by-turn navigation directions. Smart Resume is on by default, and can be turned off in Nitpicky Details. Delete episodes 24 hours after completion: Before, episodes could either be auto-deleted immediately upon completion, or not at all. There’s now a third option, auto-deleting 24 hours after completion, which will soon be the default for new accounts. The 24-hour threshold is only enforced after a successful sync, so it won’t auto-delete anything in the middle of an extended offline period, such as a long flight. Auto-deletion, either immediate or after 24 hours, also no longer applies to Premium subscribers’ Uploads. Password-protected podcasts: Some private podcast feeds, including many paid and members-only podcasts, require a username and password via HTTP Basic Auth. You can now add these in the Add URL screen. Password-protected podcasts, and other private feeds such as Patreon bonus feeds and anything using the tag, do not show up in search or recommendations. Noteworthy bug fixes: Resuming playback after quitting in the background, especially on very long podcasts and/or when using AirPods, no longer occasionally results in glitchy noises and incorrect durations. Playback under certain conditions no longer stalls, requiring pausing and playing again. Downloads now fail less often. Playback controls no longer disappear occasionally. Smart Speed total savings now appear at the bottom of the Settings screen for locales that use commas as their decimal separator.1 Extremely large playlists now only show the most/least-recent 500 episodes to improve app performance for users with very high subscription counts. There’s also one removal: rotation support on iPhone. (The iPad app still rotates.) iPhone rotation has always been disabled by default, and had been buried in Nitpicky Details for a long time, so very few people have ever used it. Meanwhile, it has become increasingly difficult to support and maintain, especially with the modern complexities of rotation and the dramatically increased workload of supporting the iPhone X in landscape. iPhone rotation has simply proven far too costly to maintain for its extremely low usage, and it had to go to free up more of my time for more highly demanded features. I apologize to the few people who did use it, and I hope this isn’t too disruptive for you. The rest is all good news. Go get Overcast now! In the next update, I’ll be addressing the biggest design failure of Overcast 4: the non-discoverability of the Effects and Notes pages in the Now Playing screen. Expect the return of an ancient user-interface tool known as “buttons”. This was Overcast’s oldest known bug, which had been there since 1.0: some users, mostly in central Europe, wouldn’t see Smart Speed totals. It turned out to be one of the most interesting and obscure bugs I’ve seen. The total-time-saved value is stored on-device as it accumulates, then gets sent to the server to be combined with any listening you do on other devices. The overall total is read back from the server, and the local total is reset, on each sync. I was using an NSNumberFormatter to read the total value from Overcast’s server as a double. My server always sends values with U.S.-style number formatting, using a period as the decimal separator (e.g. “1234.5”). But by default, NSNumberFormatter uses the device’s locale, so in countries that use a comma as the decimal separator (e.g. “1234,5”), it was interpreting the server’s numbers with periods as invalid and returning zero. So the Settings screen thought they hadn’t saved any time, and hid the time-saved label. Fortunately, it was an easy fix: setting that NSNumberFormatter locale to en_US to match what the server was sending. And since the accumulated local totals were still being sent and added properly, the correct historical data is there — it just wasn’t being displayed correctly. ↩︎",
