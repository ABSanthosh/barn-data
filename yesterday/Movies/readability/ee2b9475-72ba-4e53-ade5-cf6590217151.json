The reviews state it's \"filled with rich performances, complex characters, optimism, heartwarming revelations, and wisdom.\" This is a rather beautiful trailer that makes it look like an indie gem absolutely worth watching whenever it opens near you. Here's the first official trailer for Angus MacLachlan's film A Little Prayer, direct from YouTube: Bill (David Strathairn) is a pillar of his Southern community: a business owner, a veteran, and the proud patriarch of an unruly but loving family. His daughter Patti (Anna Camp) has returned home after the collapse of her marriage, while his son David (Will Pullen) struggles to stay afloat. He has brought David into the family business, but harbors doubts about his discipline and commitment. Bill gravitates towards Tammy (Jane Levy), his daughter-in-law \u0026 only other person in his rambunctious household who values contemplation and repose. When Bill begins to suspect that David may be straying from his marital vows with a coworker (Dascha Polanco), he must confront the perplexing inscrutability of his son's choices and their consequences for the rest of the family. A Little Prayer is both written and directed by American indie filmmaker Angus MacLachlan, director of the films Goodbye to All That, Abundant Acreage Available, and also a writer on Junebug and Stone. Produced by Max A. Butler, Lauren Vilchik, Angus MacLachlan. It first premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival a few years ago. Music Box Films releases MacLachlan's A Little Prayer in select US theaters starting August 29th, 2025 coming soon. Anyone want to watch it? Find more posts in: Indies, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
