  "description": "\"A big wedding party with all the people we love? I want the same thing... with you.\" Wayfarer Studios has unveiled an official trailer for an indie romantic comedy titled A Nice Indian Boy, which first premiered at last year's SXSW Film Festival. Finally ready for release in April this spring one year later. From director Roshan Sethi, the film is a queer romance about a boy who brings his soon-to-be-husband back to meet his very traditional family. And they even got THE hunk Jonathan Groff to play Jay the fiance. When Naveen brings his new fiancé Jay home to meet his traditional Indian family, they must contend with accepting his white-orphan-artist boyfriend and helping them plan the Indian wedding of their dreams. What follows is the comedic \u0026 heartfelt collision between the family, and Naveen – caught between the versions of himself his family and Jay know. Karan Soni stars with Jonathan Groff as his fiance, plus Sunita Mani, Zarna Garg, Harish Patel, Peter S. Kim, and Sas Goldberg. This looks super sweet and fun and wholesome. It's not trying to reinvent the romcom wheel, just wants to be a nice, feel-good film we can all enjoy. Got me. […]",

Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Roshan Sethi's film A Nice Indian Boy, direct from YouTube: \"First comes love. Then comes chaos.\" When Naveen (Karan Soni), a soft spoken doctor, finally brings his charming white-artist boyfriend Jay (Jonathan Groff) back home to meet his traditional Indian family, misunderstandings and emotional revelations put everyone on edge. Despite facing uncomfortable truths about their own ideas of love and marriage, the family attempts to plan the big Indian wedding of Naveen and Jay's dreams. A Nice Indian Boy is directed by Indian writer / filmmaker Roshan Sethi, director of the films 7 Days and World's Best previously. The screenplay is written by Eric Randall, based on the play by Madhuri Shekar. Produced by Justin Baldoni, Charlie McSpadden, Renee Witt. This initially premiered at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival last year.
