  "text": "After nearly two decades of operating independently, FSR is now for sale.Published December 10, 2024NewsDisclaimerWhen you purchase through affiliate links on our site, we may earn a commission. Film School Rejects is for sale. After more than 17 years of being owned and operated independently by a single owner — a person who didn’t come from any generational wealth and has essentially run the site off of his credit cards for two decades — this publication has reached a point of unsustainability that has forced its owner into a state of significant financial duress. Now, the only path forward is to find a new owner who can revive it and take it into a new era. In a time of unprecedented corporate consolidation, AI content scraping, and search engines devaluing human-generated content, it has become increasingly difficult to remain independent, produce high-quality content, and stay afloat in the film criticism and entertainment journalism spaces. Over the years, FSR has been a fantastic launch pad for some of the industry’s most talented voices. Many of our writers have gone on to grace the pages of prestigious publications and make a significant impact on the world of film and television criticism. It has also delighted and engaged readers with its commitment to being an independent oasis in a sea of corporate content farms. We hope to find a new owner who will hold true to these ideals and carry FSR’s mission forward while allowing its current owner to get out from under the weight of his debt. Whatever comes next, we are eternally thankful to all of the editors, writers, and readers who have passed through these digital halls over the nearly two decades that FSR has existed. Without you and your shared love of the many topics we’ve covered over the years, we would not have made it this far. We have always strived to remain fiercely independent with our editorial voice, keep our content free and not paywalled, and provide a home for under-represented voices in the mainstream entertainment conversation. While this is an incredibly sad day in FSR’s history, it is not without hope that a hero will emerge and see that its best days are ahead. Anyone with serious interest should contact neil@filmschoolrejects.com for more information. Tagged with: Breaking NewsIndustry Film School Rejects An author similar to Hydra.
