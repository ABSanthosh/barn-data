It was originally created 12 years ago and is still up to watch anytime. \"This was originally a college project that I was going to remove from YouTube, but it seems to have got quite a great following. Thanks Hitchcock fans!\" This Hitchcock cameos supercut starts out with The Lodger (1927) and Easy Virtue (1928) and continues through the entire filmography ending with Frenzy (1972) and Family Plot (1976) - which was also the very last feature film that Hitchcock directed before passing away in 1980.

They add this fun tidbit: \"In his discussion with François Truffaut, Hitchcock called the gag 'troublesome' because audience anticipation of his appearance had grown distracting. To keep the focus on the film, the director would get his cameo over in the first 5 minutes.\" Ha! Follow the film's plot not him. Your favorite?
