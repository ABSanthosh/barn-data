  "text": "Buffalo Bills supporters are anxious for updates on Dalton Kincaid following his recent injury. The young tight end has been a standout player this season in the NFL, and his presence on the field is key to the team’s offensive success. With Week 7 fast approaching, fans are eager to know when he will be back in action. Here’s what we know about Kincaid’s injury and how his return could affect the Bills’ performance moving forward. How did Dalton Kincaid get injured? Dalton Kincaid suffered a collarbone injury during practice leading up to Week 7 of the 2024 NFL season (via Pro Football Network). Although the injury does not seem serious, Kincaid wore a red non-contact jersey in practice. This indicates that the Buffalo Bills are being cautious about his return to full action. Kincaid has dealt with injuries in the past, including a concussion in October 2023 that sidelined him for one game. While the current collarbone issue is not as severe, it still requires careful handling. This is especially important given the physical nature of playing tight end in the NFL. When will Dalton Kincaid return to play with the Buffalo Bills? Kincaid is expected to potentially return in Week 7, depending on how he progresses in practice. He has been listed as limited in recent practices, and his status will likely depend on his participation in Friday’s session. If he practices fully, Kincaid may suit up against the Tennessee Titans. The Bills are taking a cautious approach with Kincaid’s injury, aware of how collarbone issues can escalate with further contact. Should he remain limited or miss practice altogether, he could receive an injury designation for Week 7, meaning the team will decide his availability closer to the game. If Kincaid is unable to play, Dawson Knox is the likely replacement at tight end for the Bills. Knox, who has established chemistry with quarterback Josh Allen, would be a reliable option in Kincaid’s absence. However, Kincaid’s eventual return is highly anticipated, as his performance this season has been solid, averaging 8.1 fantasy points per game. Fantasy managers and Bills fans alike will be monitoring his progress closely.",
