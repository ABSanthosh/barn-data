So this is basically \"House\" all over again but also mashed up with Sherlock Holmes? Sure why not, looks entertaining enough. Here's the first official trailer (+ poster) for Craig Sweeny's series Watson, direct from YouTube: Takes place six months after the death of the titular character's friend and partner Sherlock Holmes at the hands of Moriarty. The show stars Morris Chestnut as Dr. John Watson, who resumes his medical career as the head of a clinic dedicated to treating rare disorders. Watson’s old life isn’t done with him, though – Moriarty and Watson are set to write their own chapter of a story that has fascinated audiences for more than a century. Watson is a medical show with a strong investigative spine, with a modern version of one of history's greatest detectives as he turns his attention from solving crimes to solving medical mysteries. Watson is a series created by Craig Sweeny, writer on \"The 4400\", \"Medium\", \"Elementary\", \"Limitless\", \"The Code\" series previously. It's also written by Sweeney - inspired by works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. With episodes directed by Clara Aranovich and Larry Teng. Made by CBS Studios. Executive produced by Craig Sweeny, Morris Chestnut, Sallie Patrick, Larry Teng, Shäron Moalem, Aaron Kaplan, Brian Morewitz. CBS will debut Watson streaming on Paramount+ and on CBS starting January 26th, 2025 coming soon. Find more posts: Streaming, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
