It has already garnered considerable attention, and numerous posts and video clips have been generated as part of the trend. Without further ado, here is what we know about this latest trend and the meaning behind the same. TikTok users wonder ‘What is the Black Death?’ A new and interesting trend, involving the phrase “What Is the Black Death?’ is going round on the short-video sharing platform, TikTok. This has drawn the interest of people on the platform and beyond. It all reportedly began after an AI video depicting a person waking up in the year 1351 was shared on TikTok. It was posted on a handle with the username @the_pov_lab. The caption reads, “POV: You wake up during the black plague (1351).” At the time of writing, the video has received 4.3 million likes and over 21 thousand comments. Here’s the viral video that started the trend: After the video went viral, it seems the phrase “What is the Black Death?” emerged as a trend on the platform. It has been shared widely, with many users utilizing creativity to create videos on the trend. The Black Death is a colloquial term for the bubonic plague pandemic that wiped out about 50% of Europe’s population between 1346 to 1353. It is one of the most devastating pandemics in the history of humanity. Moreover, the Black Death had a drastic and catastrophic impact on various aspects of 14th-century Europe. However, it remains unclear what started the plague. Some scientists and scholars believe that it originated outside Europe, while others think it started within. As the Black Death caused such an astronomical devastation, it has inspired art and literature in the following centuries. Additionally, numerous books have been written and art pieces have been made that have the pandemic as the subject matter. The Black Death has also been referenced in several video games, whose clips can be found on TikTok.",
