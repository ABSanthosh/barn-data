Have a look. Official trailer for rock doc Road Diary: Bruce Springsteen \u0026 The E Street Band, from YouTube: Intro via TIFF: \"An evocative look back at the path he and his band have blazed since the â€™70s, and a look forward to what lies on the horizon. Mortality, yes, but also more of the passion, energy, and grit theyâ€™ve always brought to touring, as they prepare to hit the road one more time. Working again with long-time collaborator Thom Zimny, Springsteen narrates this look at the singular alchemy that produced such a tight, enduring group. The film begins with beautiful, rare images of the band members barely out of boyhood, then contrasts that immediately with a present day challenge, their first tour in six years. Can they recapture the spark and dynamism they first found over 40 years earlier? Can newer members add fresh colours to the sound, and fill the gap left by the late saxophonist Clarence Clemons. Do they all still have what it takes?\" ðŸŽ¸ Road Diary: Bruce Springsteen \u0026 The E Street Band is a documentary directed by American doc filmmaker Thom Zimny, director of many other docs \u0026 concert films including Bruce Springsteen's Western Stars, Bruce Springsteen's Letter to You, Elvis Presley: The Searcher, The Ties That Bind, The Gift: The Journey of Johnny Cash, The Beach Boys, Sly, and Willie Nelson \u0026 Family most recently, among many other docs.
