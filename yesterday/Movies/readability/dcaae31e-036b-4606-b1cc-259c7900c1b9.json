This first premiered at the 2024 New York Asian Film Festival, and opened in Thai theaters last August, with a US release on VOD finally set for this March. This looks totally disgusting!

This one is made for all the crazy gross disgusting horror movie fanatics out there! So much gooey, slimy nastiness in this trailer.

Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Kongkiat Komesiri's horror Operation Undead, on YouTube: World War II – 1941. Chumphon Province, Thailand. Mek (Chanon Santinatornkul), a new sergeant, and Mok (Awat Ratanapintha), his younger brother in the Youth Soldier unit, face a mysterious threat when \"something\" belonging to the Japanese goes missing during their landing. This leads Mok and his fellow youth soldiers to encounter horrors far worse than war. Even after Thailand \u0026 Japan declare a ceasefire, Mek receives a special covert mission to clean up the area alongside a Japanese combat unit, unaware that this might include his own brother. Operation Undead, also called Operacion Zombie: Resurreccion in Spanish, is written and directed by Thai filmmaker Kongkiat Komesiri (aka Kome Kongkiat Komesiri), of the films Sema: The Warrior of Ayodhaya, Art of the Devil 2 \u0026 3, Muay Thai Fighter, Slice, The 4 Movie, The Gangster, Take Me Home, Khun Phan 1 \u0026 2 \u0026 3, Pay It Forward, and Bangkok Breaking: Heaven and Hell previously.
