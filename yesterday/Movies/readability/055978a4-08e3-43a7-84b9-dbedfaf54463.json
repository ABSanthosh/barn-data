  "text": "Ben Stiller is calling out Pat McAfee for comments about his presence at the NBA Eastern Conference Finals. Stiller, a well known New York Knicks fan, was courtside at Tuesday’s Eastern Conference finals matchup between the Knicks and the Indiana Pacers. He was in attendance in Indianapolis, along with fellow New York natives Timothée Chalamet and Spike Lee. McAfee, a Pacers fan, was also there; during the start of the game, he grabbed the mic to throw some shade at the A-listers. “Indianapolis, Indiana, we got some bigwigs from the big city in the building,” McAfee said. “Spike Lee is here. Ben Stiller is here. Timothée Chalamet is here. Let’s send these sons of bitches back to New York with their ears bleeding!” Popular on Variety Each name was met with resounding boos from the crowd as McAfee announced them. The game ended in a Pacers’ win, with a score of 130-121. On Tuesday, Stiller took to X to respond to McAfee’s callout, replying to a video of the ordeal. “Yes. Weird,” Stiller wrote. “We were happy to be there and cheer our team and other than that Indy fans were awesome. #KNICKSIN7.” Stiller expanded on his thoughts in a follow-up reply. He wrote, “It’s ok. He must be playing around – if it’s an actual point of view it seems a little anachronistic or cliche? Like we are ‘big city celebs’ and we shouldn’t be there in the heartland? Again, everyone we met was awesome and incredibly cool.” Another user told Stiller not to be “bitter,” to which the “Zoolander” star replied, “No bitterness at all Indy fans were amazing good win for you guys.”",
