  "text": "Ben Stiller is set to star in the upcoming hourlong dramedy series The Band at HBO, according to a recent report from Deadline. What do we know about The Band? The series, which is currently in development at HBO, is created by Sarah Violet Bliss and Charles Rogers, the duo behind the hit TBS comedy Search Party. The show will follow Stiller’s character Oscar, a talent mogul who is tasked with creating a boy band. The series will focus on the music industry, and offer up “an inside look at the music industry centered on Oscar (Stiller), a pop impresario and talent mogul beset by scandal who is tasked with forming a new act in order to save his career – and perhaps his soul,” according to the logline for the series. Bliss and Rogers will serve as showrunners, and will also executive produce the series alongside Stiller, John Lesher, Savan Kotecha, Michael Ellenberg, and Lindsey Springer. For Stiller, this is a rare lead role in a television series for the legendary actor. Prior to this, his only other lead role in a TV series came in his own 1990 sketch comedy show The Ben Stiller Show. Stiller has appeared in small roles in television projects across his career, however, including cameos on Arrested Development and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Stiller is known for his countless hit comedy films, including There’s Something About Mary, Zoolander, Tropic Thunder, the Meet the Parents films, Night at the Museum, the Madagascar franchise, and more. Stiller is also prolific behind the camera, where he’s worked primarily since 2010. He currently serves as the primary director for Apple TV+’s Severance, which was created by showrunner Dan Erickson. (Source: Deadline)",
