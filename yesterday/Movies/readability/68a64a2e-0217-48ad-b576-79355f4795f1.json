Inner Portrait shows us how these new environments broadened their perspectives, challenge their preconceptions, and enrich their inner worlds.\" Inner Portrait is a special documentary art / cinema project directed by acclaimed Australian nature filmmaker Jennifer Peedom, director of the excellent doc films Solo, Miracle on Everest, Sherpa, Mountain, and River previously. In collaboration with American-Turkish artist Refik Anadol and Turkish Airlines. Featuring cinematography by Cam Batten \u0026 Renan Ozturk.
