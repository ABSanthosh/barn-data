So far, NFL fans have been treated to a hoard of action-packed games, a trend that appears to continue as we enter Week 15 of the league phase. Despite experiencing an injury-riddled season, teams have refused to give up on their dreams to make it to the postseason. As such, fans are incredibly excited to catch today’s match-up between the Kansas City Chiefs and Cleveland Browns. Find out how and when you can view the game between the Chiefs and the Browns live below. Where can you watch the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Cleveland Browns game today? You can watch Kansas City Chiefs vs. Cleveland Browns today via Paramount Plus, NFL+, FuboTV, Hulu, and the CBS channels in select regions. The game will be broadcast on television on CBS’ local stations in a select range of regions. Fans can also catch the match live digitally through NFL+, the league’s premier streaming platform, FuboTV, Hulu, and Paramount Plus. What time does the game start? Kansas City Chiefs vs. Cleveland Browns takes place at 1 PM ET and 10 AM PT on December 15. Kansas City Chiefs are on track to register a historic NFL season, as they currently hold a record of 12-1. The reigning Super Bowl champions have only lost one bout this season, establishing their dominance in the AFC West division. On the other hand, the Cleveland Browns currently languish in last place in the AFC North conference, having managed a disappointing 3-10 record so far. How to watch \u0026 stream Kansas City Chiefs vs. Cleveland Browns for free? You can watch Kansas City Chiefs vs. Cleveland Browns for free via FuboTV, Hulu, and Paramount Plus. FuboTV and Paramount Plus allow new users to opt for a 7-day free trial upon signing up. Meanwhile, Hulu’s introductory period for fresh subscribers concludes after a whopping 30 days. Nevertheless, users must pay the standard subscription rates after their trial concludes in all the options. Predictions The Chiefs’ only weakness this season has been the narrow margins by which they have won their fixtures. Notably, Kansas City’s last three victories have come with a combined difference of seven points, which could emerge as a point of concern for head coach Andy Reid. That being said, the Chiefs should not face much resistance against a meek Cleveland side. The Browns not only sport a weak defense but have also made several errors on the offensive front. As such, the Chiefs should be able to exploit their rivals’ incoherent structure and etch their 13th victory of the season today.",
