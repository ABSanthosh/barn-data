If you're like me and want to enjoy it fresh, now is the time to stop watching more videos until it opens in theaters. Enjoy. Here's the extra \"A Look Inside\" promo for Gareth Edwards' Jurassic World Rebirth, from YouTube: You can rewatch the first trailer for Edwards' Jurassic World Rebirth movie right here and trailer #2 here. This action-packed new chapter sees an extraction team race to the most dangerous place on Earth, an island research facility for the original Jurassic Park, inhabited by the worst of the worst that were left behind. Five years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion (released in 2022), the planet's ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind. Jurassic World Rebirth is directed by the acclaimed British sci-fi filmmaker Gareth Edwards, director of the sci-fi movies Monsters, Godzilla, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, and The Creator previously. The screenplay is written by David Koepp (also of Jurassic Park, Carlito's Way, Mission: Impossible, Premium Rush, Inferno, Kimi). Produced by Frank Marshall Patrick Crowley. Made by Amblin Entertainment and The Kennedy/Marshall Company. Universal will debut Edwards' Jurassic World Rebirth movie in theaters worldwide starting July 2nd, 2025 this summer movie season.
