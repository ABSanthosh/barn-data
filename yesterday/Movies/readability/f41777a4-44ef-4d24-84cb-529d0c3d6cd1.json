  "text": "Netflix’s latest YA film, a slasher in multiple senses of the word, has arrived just in time for Halloween. The spooky film stars Antonia Gentry (Ginny \u0026 Georgia) and Madison Bailey (Outer Banks) as the Field sisters separated by time and space — twenty years of it. The film begins with Lucy (Madison Bailey) living the life of your normal average teenager on the anniversary of her sister’s death. Bailey’s Lucy, who wants to intern for NASA in Washington D.C. over the summer and has the brains to figure out time travel,  stumbles upon a mysterious machine at the site of her sister’s death back that allows her to go back in time to the early aughts from the current day to try and save Gentry’s Summer from a serial killer known as the Sweetly Slasher. Lucy  faces the tricky task of doing so while failing to disrupt the future and fracture timelines. Griffin Gluck (Locke \u0026 Key, Cruel Summer) also appears. Several needle drops — from Fat Joe, Olivia Rodrigo, Vanessa Carlton, Wheatus, Avril Lavigne and more — make it clear which time period or nostalgic memory viewers are in, signalling the importance of pop culture in the moments. Other details such as a Buffy the Vampire Slayer poster in Summer’s room, an iPhone, wardrobe differences and more show just how much contrast exists between then and now. Find the full Time Cut soundtrack below: Watch on Deadline “What’s Luv?” Performed by Fat Joe “Pork And Beef” Performed by The Coup “Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl” Performed by Olivia Rodrigo “A Thousand Miles” Performed by Vanessa Carlton “Ain’t Got You” Performed by Kevin Qian “So Yesterday” Performed by Hillary Duff “Teenage Dirtbag” Performed by Wheatus “Coming Home” Performed by Emma Jayne “Get Poppin” Performed by PMG “Complicated” Performed by Avril Lavigne “All You Wanted” Performed by Michelle Branch",
