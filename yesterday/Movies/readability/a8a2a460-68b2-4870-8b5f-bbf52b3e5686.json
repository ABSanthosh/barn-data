  "text": "As The Young and the Restless gears up for a fascinating episode on July 8, 2025, things do not look good for Tessa and Mariah, who seem to have hit a roadblock that won’t clear out anytime soon. Following the Young and Restless spoilers, fans speculate that Tessa and Mariah may even be headed for divorce in the upcoming episode. So, what has made viewers think that the popular couple may part ways in Y\u0026R? Here’s everything to know. Will Tessa end her marriage with Mariah in The Young and the Restless? While there is nothing that explicitly confirms that Tessa (Camryn Grimes) and Mariah’s (Cait Fairbanks) marriage in Young and Restless will end, there is a significant hint in the spoilers for the July 8 episode. With other intriguing developments all around Genoa City, Tessa and Mariah continue to face problems in their marriage. Tessa feels upset that Mariah will not open up to her. She also fails to understand why her spouse refuses to share the real reasons behind her distant behavior and actions. With this continuing for a while, the couple has a heated conversation. It seems that Mariah understands the damage she has done to their relationship, but is unable to do anything to make it better. During this heated conversation, Tessa says that they may not be able to come back from their present state and that they should make their separation permanent. Thus, this suggests that the only way forward for the couple is to get a divorce. Meanwhile, Mariah does not want things to end with Tessa, but it seems that the latter is beyond conviction at this point. So, as things stand, the couple may not be able to find a middle ground anytime soon, and it may actually lead to their separation. This will come as a shock to most Young and Restless fans, but things have been tense between the two for quite a while now. If there is no solution to Mariah’s behavior right away, it could indeed take a turn for the worse in the coming weeks on Y\u0026R.",
