  "text": "Donald Trump took to Truth Social Sunday to announce he is “authorizing” the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to impose a 100% tariff on “any and all” movies produced in “foreign lands.” Trump deemed foreign productions a “national security threat” to the American movie industry, adding that they not only draw filmmakers out to other markets but also bring “messaging and propaganda” into the United States. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” Trump wrote. “Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated. This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda! Therefore, I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands. WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Popular on Variety Trump’s last move on Hollywood was naming Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as “special ambassadors” to the American film industry, although no significant developments have been made by the trio since their appointment in January. Although Trump claims that Hollywood is down for the count, 2025 has actually seen a rebound in box office numbers since last year. Overall domestic revenues are up 15.8% head of 2024. Though still 31% behind 2019, hits like “A Minecraft Moive,” “Sinners” and “Thunderbolts*” bring hope of closing the gap.",
