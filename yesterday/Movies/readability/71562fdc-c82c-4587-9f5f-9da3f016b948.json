The film will screen a total of five times over the course of the festival and hopefully will find wide release shortly after its festival run. Many thanks to the team at TOUCH ME for chatting with me and trust me when I say that you have to see this movie to believe it.  Until next time, take care! -McEric, aka Eric McClanahan-",
