On April 15, The Glass Dome drops on Netflix. The drama series focuses on the mission of a criminologist and a former police officer to find a missing girl in a small town. However, the investigation takes unexpected turns as mysteries unravel. Further, Young Sheldon Season 7 will be available on the streaming platform this week. It resumes the journey of the brilliant young child, Sheldon Cooper. While the kid is extraordinary when it comes to academics, he lacks social skills. Nevertheless, Sheldon keeps surprising everyone with his intelligence. Also coming out on Netflix is the romantic-comedy Baby Mama. It revolves around Kate Holbrook, who hires a working-class woman as a surrogate for her child after finding out about her infertility. However, things go upside down when the woman demands a place to live. This leads to a series of hilarious adventures as Kate and the surrogate try living together peacefully. Additionally, Ransom Canyon will be available on the streaming platform on April 17. The romantic western drama series is loosely based on Jodi Thomas’ books. It follows the adventures of the people at Ramson Canyon as they fight for their land.
