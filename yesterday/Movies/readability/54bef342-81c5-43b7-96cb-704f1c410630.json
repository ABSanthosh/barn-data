  "text": "Cameron Diaz is ready to go green (again). Diaz, who just came out of a 10-year retirement from acting in Netflix’s “Back in Action,” recently revealed to Access Hollywood that she’d be open to returning for a sequel to the 1994 comedy “The Mask” as long as Jim Carrey is involved. “If Jim’s on board, I mean, I’ve been riding those coattails from day one,” she said about the possibility of reprising her role as nightclub singer Tina Carlyle. “The Mask” starred Carrey as mild-mannered bank teller Stanley Ipkis, whose life is turned upside down when he discovers a mask that possesses him with the spirit of a magical trickster. Carrey previously expressed to Comicbook.com that he’d also be open to returning for a sequel to “The Mask,” provided the project had a strong enough script. Popular on Variety “Oh gosh, you know, it has to be the right idea,” said Carrey, who most recently reprised his role as Doctor Robotnik in “Sonic the Hedgehog 3.” “If somebody had the right idea, I guess… It’s not really about the money,” Carrey said. “I joke about the money… But I never know. You can’t be definite about these things. I said I’d like to retire, but I think I was talking more about power-resting. Because as soon as a good idea comes your way, or a group of people that you really enjoyed working with and stuff, it just — things tend to change.” In the same Access Hollywood interview, Diaz also expressed an interest in returning for another “Charlie’s Angels” sequel alongside Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu, joking that “Back in Action” co-star Jamie Foxx could play Bosley. “I’m gonna text [Liu] right now and pitch her Jamie as Bosley.” Diaz teased.",
