It's nifty! Maybe just a fun promo gimmick, but I do like that they're trying to shake things up with a unique way of presenting this movie. Maybe they can make my chair in the movie theater vibrate with the engines, too? You can rewatch the second official trailer for Kosinski's F1 movie right here, or the recent racing featurette. Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt), a Formula One driver who raced in the 1990s, has a horrible crash, forcing him to retire from Formula One and start racing in other disciplines. A Formula One team owner and friend contacts Hayes and asks him to come out of retirement to mentor rookie prodigy Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris) on the Apex Grand Prix team (APXGP). F1, also known as Formula 1, is directed by the visionary American filmmaker Joe Kosinski (aka Joseph Kosinski), director of the movies Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, Only the Brave, and Top Gun: Maverick previously, plus a few other music videos and lots of commercials. The screenplay is written by Ehren Kruger (writer of Arlington Road, Scream 3, Reindeer Games, The Ring, Blood \u0026 Chocolate, Transformers 2 - 4, Ghost in the Shell, Dumbo, Top Gun: Maverick). Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, Chad Oman, Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, Lewis Hamilton, and Kosinski. Made by Apple Studios, Bruckheimer Films, Plan B, Dawn Apollo Films. Apple + Warner Bros opens Kosinski's F1 movie in theaters worldwide starting June 27th, 2025 - racing your way this summer. Who's excited for it? Find more posts in: To Watch, Trailer",
