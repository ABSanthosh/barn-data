  "text": "Nominations voting is from January 8-12, 2025, with official Oscar nominations announced January 17, 2025. Final voting is February 11-18, 2025. And finally, the 97th Oscars telecast will be broadcast on Sunday, March 2 and air live on ABC at 7:00 p.m. ET/ 4:00 p.m. PT. We update our picks through awards season, so keep checking IndieWire for all our 2025 Oscar predictions. The State of the Race While the Best Documentary Feature nominations have gotten increasingly hard to predict, there are usually about eight to 10 titles that seem like a lock for the shortlist based on accolades like a Critics Choice Documentary Award nomination or several honors from film festivals. Since Sundance, it has been readily apparent that Netflix is gunning for the win in this category, having acquired “Daughters” and “The Remarkable Life of Ibelin,” two big award winners at the January festival, as well as “Will \u0026 Harper,” which was one of the most well-received premieres there. However, the latter film is also the biggest wild card, as the Documentary Branch tends to avoid films centered around a celebrity. It is likely to make the shortlist, as both “American Symphony” and “Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie” did last year, but the question remains whether or not it strays far enough from the showbiz doc label to win over the more worldly, erudite sect of voters. Popular on IndieWire Netflix honestly has such a strong documentary slate that even the films that seem to be getting much less of a push, like “Mountain Queen: The Summits of Lhakpa Sherpa” or “Yintah,” could viably make the cut with the right campaign. One film slightly coming out of nowhere (it quietly premiered at Tribeca) is “State of Silence,” about freedom of speech issues in Mexico. Similar to the “To Kill a Tiger,” which boasted a large group of big name producers like Mindy Kaling, Dev Patel, and Priyanka Chopra Jonas, and received and Best Documentary Feature nomination before Netflix finally acquired it, “State of Silence” boasts Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna as executive producers. This is especially notable since the pair of Mexican actors are on a major press run right now for their Hulu show “La Máquina,” which overlaps with guild season, so they will have plenty of time to draw attention to the film. “Sugarcane,” the nominations leader at the 2024 Critics Choice Documentary Awards, was National Geographic’s big Sundance acquisition, and seems the most likely to appeal to all the different demographics assessing the contenders in this category. Given the weight of its narrative about the infamous residential schools that the indigenous communities in Canada and the United States were forced into, the film seems likely to make the IDA Documentary Awards shortlist as well, which tends to make more arcane choices.  This year being politically fraught as well means that even if distributors have yet to acquire films like “Zurawski v Texas,” about American abortion bans, and “No Other Land,” about Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, there is definitely still an audience for the films, with any Academy member regularly attending film festivals able to spread the word about them. Even “Separated” from master documentarian Errol Morris had a difficult road to distribution, and will still not premiere until after the 2024 presidential election, even though it has important revelations to share about President Trump’s family separation policy. Imperialism continues to be a big subject of discussion within the most acclaimed documentaries of the year, months after “20 Days in Mariupol” won the most recent Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. Even though films like “Dahomey” or “Porcelain War” or “Soundtrack to a Coup d’Etat” are coming from smaller distribution companies, the subject matter in those films should strike a chord with politically minded voters. But again, everything can quickly change in this race as there is still much more to see from groups like the aforementioned International Documentary Association and Doc NYC, whose shortlists should especially illuminate which international titles are being feted by professionals within the doc space. Contenders for the shortlist of 15 are listed in alphabetical order below. No documentary will be deemed a frontrunner until we have seen the film. Frontrunners:“Black Box Diaries”“Dahomey”“Daughters”“Frida”“The Last of the Sea Women”“No Other Land”“Porcelain War”“The Remarkable Life of Ibelin”“Separated”“Soundtrack to a Coup d’Etat”“State of Silence”“Sugarcane”“Union”“Will \u0026 Harper”“Zurawski v Texas” Contenders:“A New Kind of Wilderness”“Afternoons of Solitude”“And So It Begins”“Apocalypse in the Tropics”“Bad River”“Blink”“Bread and Roses”“Ernest Cole: Lost and Found”“From Ground Zero”“Hollywoodgate”“Made in England: The Films of Powell and Pressburger”“Piece by Piece”“Seeking Mavis Beacon”“Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story”“War Game”",
