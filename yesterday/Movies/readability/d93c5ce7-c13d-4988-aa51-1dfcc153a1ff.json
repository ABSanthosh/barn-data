  "text": "The Prime Video anthology series Secret Level has officially been renewed for a second season, with Amazon confirming that more adventures are coming. According to Amazon (via Variety), the first season of Secret Level has been a smash hit for the streaming platform. It was the platform’s most-watched animated series debut of all time within its first week. No official information on Secret Level Season 2 has been made available, so it’s unknown what projects the show will cover going forward. What is Secret Level about? The series, which hails from the creative team behind the hit Netflix anthology series Love Death + Robots, features 15 original stories set within the worlds of various popular video game franchises. The show was created and executive produced by Deadpool director Tim Miller, with Dave Wilson also serving as an executive producer and supervising director. The first season of the show featured a star-studded voice cast consisting of Arnold Schwarzenegger (The Terminator Franchise), Kevin Hart (Jumanji), Keanu Reeves (John Wick), Temuera Morrison (The Book of Boba Fett), Ariana Greenblatt (Barbie), Emily Swallow (The Mandalorian), and Gabriel Luna (The Last of Us). Additional cast includes Heaven Hart, Ricky Whittle (American Gods, Land of Bad), Patrick Schwarzenegger (The White Lotus), Merle Dandridge (The Last of Us), Claudia Doumit (The Boys), Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Lost), Clive Standen (The Morning Show), Laura Bailey (The Legend of Vox Machina), and Michael Beach Tulsa King). It is a production by Amazon MGM Studios and Blur Studio. “The show features original stories set within the worlds of some of the most beloved video games,” reads the logline for the series. “Each of the 15 episodes is a celebration of games and gamers. Games that inspired the 15 epic stories include Armored Core, Concord, Crossfire, Dungeons \u0026 Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, Mega Man, New World: Aeternum, PAC-MAN, various PlayStation Studios games, Sifu, Spelunky, The Outer Worlds, Unreal Tournament and Warhammer 40,000.” Secret Level is now available to watch on Prime Video, where all 15 episodes are now live.
