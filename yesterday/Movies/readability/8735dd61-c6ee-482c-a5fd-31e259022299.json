  "text": "Irv Wilson, a former programming executive at NBC and producer of several high profile TV movies that starred Jerry Lewis, Martin Sheen, Telly Savalas, Bruce Dern and Morgan Freeman, died December 26 after a short illness. He was 93. His death was confirmed by his longtime friend, Tom Nunan, who paid tribute to Wilson on Facebook by writing, “Wilson loved life, and anyone who became close to him knew that a good glass of red wine, a little weed, [his wife’s] cooking, and a Giants game came pretty close to heaven for the well-loved, culturally complex maven.” Born in New York City, Wilson served in the Korean war before returning to the Big Apple to attend NYU via the G.I. Bill. He would go on to spend his career in the entertainment industry, first as a talent agent and producer, then as a TV programming executive for NBC where he oversaw the TV movie department and later, daytime and late night programming. He worked alongside Fred Silverman and Brandon Tartikoff and helped to discover future filmmakers such as Ron Howard while supporting gifted playwrights like Stanley Greenberg. Watch on Deadline After his network executive life, Wilson returned to producing work under deals at Fries Entertainment and Viacom, where he made several high profile TV movies. He may be best known for executive producing The Missiles of October, an ABC made-for-TV play from 1974 about the Cuban Missile Crisis that starred William Devane as President John F. Kennedy and Martin Sheen as Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Nunan says his friend was also proud of his 1980 TV movie FDR: The Last Year for NBC that starred Jason Robards. Wilson was a lifelong Giants fan, even after their move to San Francisco. He was also a news and information junkie and liked to spend much of his retirement debating politics. “He will be missed by many, but remembered by all who met him as simply a wonderful guy, a true character who always managed to get you to pick up lunch,” Nunan said on Facebook. “As he’d put it himself, he was King of the ‘Schnorrers.’ Look it up. It’s Yiddish, the language of giants.” Wilson is survived by Anne Carlucci, his wife of 46 years who was also a prolific TV movie producer; and his daughters Amy, Julie, and Kate.",
