  "text": "Veteran MCU producer Nate Moore has recently come out to clarify why the original title of Captain America 4 was altered to Brave New World. One of the most anticipated projects in the current MCU slate, it was originally announced at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con as Captain America: New World Order. However, in a later update, actor Anthony Mackie subtly confirmed a name shift to Captain America: Brave New World. While harmless, many have since wondered why the change was adopted in the first place. In a recent discussion, Moore has revealed the precise reasons behind this decision. Captain America 4 producer reveals why the title changed to Brave New World Per Moore, “New World Order” was trimmed from the Captain America 4 title due to its relevance to present-day society. He also stated that the modification was favored as the initial label “made people uncomfortable.” Nate Moore, who has been associated with Marvel Studios since 2010, divulged the said information in an interview with Empire. “I think ‘New World Order’ was a title we thought was really interesting and sort of moody and scary. Some of the feedback we got, internally and externally, was that that phrase has, unfortunately, been co-opted in the real world in a way that made people uncomfortable,” Moore stated while explaining the change in the Captain America 4 title. Notably, “New World Order” was also the name of the debut episode of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier series. The Disney+ show dealt with the global implications that occurred in the aftermath of the correction of Thanos’ snap. Additionally, it solidified Anthony Mackie as the successor to Chris Evans’ Captain America in the MCU. Captain America 4, now titled Captain America: Brave New World is scheduled to hit theatres on February 14, 2025. Helmed by Julius Onah, the movie features Harrison Ford, Anthony Mackie, Giancarlo Esposito, Liv Tyler, and Tim Blake Nelson, among others. Originally reported by Apoorv Rastogi on SuperHeroHype.",
