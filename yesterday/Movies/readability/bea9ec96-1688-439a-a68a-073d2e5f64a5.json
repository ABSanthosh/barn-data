  "text": "Below are The 1% Club questions and answers for Australia Season 3 for 2025. Like the UK and US versions of the popular game show, this AUS variant on Seven Network (and 7plus) poses questions that get harder and harder over the course of the episode. But since these brain-teasers are based on common sense and logic, contestants can figure out the solution without needing to know that much trivia. Comedian Jim Jefferies returns as the host for the third season. Here’s a list of every question and answer for the 2025 Australian episodes of The 1% Club. List of The 1% Club (AUS) questions and answers for 2025 The following is a breakdown of The 1% Club questions and answers for each episode in AUS Season 3. They are placed in chronological order with the answers hidden (click on the arrows below each question to reveal the solution). You can also use the quick list below to advance to the exact episode you want the answers for. We’ll update this guide as more episodes in the third season are released. (Note: The episodes of Season 3 have aired wildly out of order as 7plus .)

Answer to 60% Question – CHICKENS.

[When the door is open the sign becomes Sophie Sells Sand Here.] 40% Question \u0026 Answer Q: Ebony and Shellie are spending $1,500 a quarter on electricity. Shellie comes up with the bright idea of installing their own wind turbine. The turbine will cost $36,000 to install and then nothing for electricity after that. In how many years will the turbine have paid for itself? Answer to 40% Question – 6 years. If Shellie and Ebony are spending $1,500 a quarter, then the maths is: $1,500 x 4 = $6,000 a year. $36,000 divided by $6,000 = 6 years to pay for itself. 35% Question \u0026 Answer Q: The writers think Jim comes to work with his top on backwards too often. Which of these nonsense words is the odd one out? PMUJSUIT, DRACIGAN, SKIBIDIE, DNAHBAGS, UORTSERS Answer to 35% Question – SKIBIDIE.

As Bo is 16, Allegra was 24 when she had him, so he is not a twin. Neither is Anni, who is older than Bo.

If you take Phoebe’s 4 bonus eggs from the total 20 there are sixteen left. These are evenly divided between Phoebe and Walter, so Walter will end up with 8.

Half the adults take 3 each and three quarters of the kids take 2 each until there are none left. How many did Sue put out? Answer to 5% Question – 150. In a quirk of mathematics, no matter what arrangement of adults and kids there are, it always works out to 150 sausage rolls. For math buffs out there, let’s take x to be the number of adults. Then 100 – x is the number of kids at the party. x/2 * 3 is half the adults taking 3 buns and (100-x) * 3/4 * 2 is three quarters of the kids taking 2 each. This reduces to 3x/2 + (300-3x)/2 = 3x/2 + 150 – 3x/2 = 150. 1% Question \u0026 Answer [Image Credit: 7plus] Q: What word is the solution to this card problem?

In a quirk of mathematics, no matter what arrangement of adults and kids there are, it always works out to 150 sausage rolls.\n\nFor math buffs out there, let’s take x to be the number of adults. Then 100 – x is the number of kids at the party. x/2 * 3 is half the adults taking 3 buns and (100-x) * 3/4 * 2 is three quarters of the kids taking 2 each. This reduces to 3x/2 + (300-3x)/2 = 3x/2 + 150 – 3x/2 = 150.\u003c/details\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"h-1-question-amp-answer-4\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1% Question \u0026amp; Answer\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/1-percent-club-aus-season-3-episode-7-1-question-answer-edit.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/1-percent-club-aus-season-3-episode-7-1-question-answer-edit.jpg 1920w, https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/1-percent-club-aus-season-3-episode-7-1-question-answer-edit.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/1-percent-club-aus-season-3-episode-7-1-question-answer-edit.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/1-percent-club-aus-season-3-episode-7-1-question-answer-edit.jpg?resize=1024,576 1024w, https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/1-percent-club-aus-season-3-episode-7-1-question-answer-edit.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/1-percent-club-aus-season-3-episode-7-1-question-answer-edit.jpg?resize=101,57 101w, https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/1-percent-club-aus-season-3-episode-7-1-question-answer-edit.jpg?resize=203,114 203w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e[Image Credit: 7plus]\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eQ: What word is the solution to this card problem?
