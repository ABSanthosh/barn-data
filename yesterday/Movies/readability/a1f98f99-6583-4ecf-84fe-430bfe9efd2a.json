  "text": "While she remains a tabloid fixture, generating millions of clicks for celebrity publications, Meghan Markle has not been able to convert that interest into views for her Netflix cooking and lifestyle series With Love, Meghan. In the What We Watched semi-annual Netflix report about the performance of all of its titles from January-June 2025, With Love, Meghan ranked #383 with 5.3 million views since its March 4 debut. That is very low for a Netflix original — and pretty unprecedented for a show that has been renewed. The program was surrounded in that part of the rankings largely by previous seasons of Netflix series as well as acquired titles. While viewers showed little interest in Markle’s new series, they continued to show up for her old one, Suits, which has been on Netflix for two years and on USA Network and other streaming platforms before that. The legal drama’s first four seasons, featuring Markle, all ranked higher than With Love, Meghan: at #151 (S1, 9.3M), #242 (S2, 7.2M), #311 (S3, 6.2M) and #378, (S4, 5.3M). Watch on Deadline Love, Meghan‘s situation is atypical, with Seasons 1 and 2 filmed back-to-back, so the second one had been completed before the series premiered March 4 (its debut was delayed by the LA fires). It only spent one week in Netflix’s Global Top 10 (English), at #10 with 2.6M viewers for its first weekend. Season 2 is supposed to premiere in the fall but no date has been announced. Of the other unscripted shows under Prince Harry and Markle’s Netflix overall deal, the 2022 docuseries Harry \u0026 Meghan drew 1.3M more views during the first half of 2025 to rank #1764. Subscribers largely shrugged off Harry’s Polo, which logged paltry 500,000 views to rank #3436. It was released Dec. 10.",
