As KJ struggles with the aftermath of his father's death and thoughts of suicide, he \u0026 Barry forge a friendship that saves them both. The story is \"deeply rooted in [the director's] upbringing and relationships... I grew up in a blue-collar area as one of only a few Jewish families, which often resulted in getting bullied \u0026 feeling marginalized. In addition to being raised by a strong single parent and being from Philadelphia, the combination has always gravitated me towards projects that amplify underdog stories.\" The Golden Voice, formerly known as Rittenhouse Square, is written and directed by the American indie filmmaker Brandon Eric Kamin, making his second feature film after directing The Nomads (2019) previously. It's produced by Robyn K. Bennett, J. Andrew Greenblatt, as well as Brandon Eric Kamin. This initially premiered at the 2022 Philadelphia Film Festival as a work-in-progress. Vertical will debut Kamin's The Golden Voice in select US theaters + on VOD starting February 28th, 2025 coming soon. Look good? Find more posts in: Indies, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
