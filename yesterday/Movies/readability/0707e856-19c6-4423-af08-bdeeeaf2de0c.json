Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Alexis Langlois' musical Queens of Drama, from YouTube: An outrageous lesbian pop musical satire inspired by the pop frenzy of the early 2000s, Queens of Drama charts the rise and fall of new star Mimi Madamour and her passionate, rage-fueled love affair with punk icon Billie Kohler. Over the course of half a century we follow these drama queens as they top the charts and set sail on the course of mad queer love. Director Alexis Langlois brings trademark glittercore pop-punk aesthetic to create a vibrant, unforgettable spectacle of music and passion. Queens of Drama, also known as Les Reines du Drame in French, is directed by French indie filmmaker Alexis Langlois, making his feature directorial debut after many short films \u0026 music videos previously. The screenplay is written by Alexis Langlois, Carlotta Coco, Thomas Colineau. Produced by Inès Daien Dasi and Benoit Rolland. This initially premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival last year playing in the Critics' Week sidebar. It already opened in France last fall. Altered Innocence debuts Langlois' Queens of Drama film in select US theaters (exclusively at Alamo Drafthouse locations) starting on April 18th, 2025 this spring. So who's intrigued?
