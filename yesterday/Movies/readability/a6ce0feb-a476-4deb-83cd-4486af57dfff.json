This Electra follows two journalists who travel to the lush Italian villa of a famous musician and his partner for an interview, but all is not as it seems — the trip spirals into deceit \u0026 deadly betrayals. Hala Matar teases: \"Electra is a film about lies and deceit, where characters wear metaphorical masks to impress or manipulate others. The unicorn, representing the mask of innocence, is drawn from a painting central to the film's plot — something I'd rather keep a mystery for now.\" The cast features Maria Bakalova, Abigail Cowen, Jack Farthing, and Daryl Wein.
