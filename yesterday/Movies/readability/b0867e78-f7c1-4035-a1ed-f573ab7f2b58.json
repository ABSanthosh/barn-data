  "text": "SAG-AFTRA is the latest Hollywood organization to pledge monetary funds to assist industry members experiencing hardship from the Los Angeles wildfires. In an announcement today, the organization said it is pledging $1 million to its SAG-AFTRA Foundation. Since the fires broke out Jan. 7, the union has temporarily closed its office in Los Angeles, additionally canceling its in-person nomination ceremony originally scheduled for the following day. “I want to thank and recognize our broadcast journalist members who are out every day amid flames, smoke and fiery embers battling to bring this important news to the world,” SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said in a statement. “The destruction caused by these blazes, the loss of life and homes, has been gut-wrenching to experience, and of course our hearts go out to all affected. But we knew we could do more; we hope this pledge helps relieve suffering and assists those impacted in putting their lives back together after this calamity. I have personally been affected by the fires and I feel deeply for others who are experiencing this tragedy. These are particularly stressful times. Stress compromises the immune system so we must be mindful of taking measures to support our health.” SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director \u0026 Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland added: “The very essence of a labor union is solidarity: that we all work to elevate each other during times of stability, and we’re there for each other in times of crisis. The devastation is hard to fathom, even for those of us living in it. We’re so fortunate to have the SAG-AFTRA Foundation as a resource and a place our members can turn to in times of need. If you have been fortunate to have been spared direct impact from this disaster, please help out in any way you can, whether by volunteer service, helping others in need, or donating to relief funds like the SAG-AFTRA Foundation’s Disaster Relief Fund.” Watch on Deadline SAG-AFTRA and the SAG-AFTRA Foundation have previously chipped in for resources and provided support to members whenever and wherever disaster has struck the nation, including flooding in New York due to Superstorm Sandy, hurricanes in the Southeast and pandemic-related relief. As noted in a new hub that has populated on the organization’s website, the fund is for members who have lost their homes in the number of fires blazing across Los Angeles — including the prominent joint Palisades and Eaton fires. The SAG-AFTRA Foundation Disaster Relief Fund is “dedicated to meeting their most urgent needs during this time of crisis,” the site read. Additionally, the hub has compiled a list of resources and links for members, including where to find mutual aid, information, safety guidelines, temporary housing, animal shelters, financial assistance, transportation, mental health support, childcare and food relief. SAG-AFTRA joins several other entertainment affiliates who have pledged financial aid, including the Motion Picture Television Fund, Will Rogers Motion Picture Pioneers Foundation, Annenberg Foundation and Wasserman Foundation and many more. As L.A. is an industry town, plenty of above- and below-the-line workers have lost their homes. Among them are actors like Mandy Moore, Milo Ventimiglia, Leighton Meester and Adam Brody, Billy Crystal, Kate Beckinsale and others.",
