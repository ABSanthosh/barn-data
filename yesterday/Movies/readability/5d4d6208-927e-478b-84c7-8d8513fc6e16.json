While sorting through her Grandmother's belongings, she uncovers a horrifying secret—a hidden chamber filled with occult artifacts that are tied to dark generational rituals. As supernatural occurrences plague her, Rosario must confront her family's buried secrets and face the truth about the sacrifices and choices they made. Rosario is directed by Colombian genre filmmaker Felipe Vargas, making his feature directorial debut with this horror, after many other shorts including Milk Teeth previously. The screenplay is written by Alan Trezza. Produced by Phillip Braun, Javier Chapa, and Jon Silk. This hasn't premiered at any film festivals or elsewhere, as far as we know. Mucho Mas Releasing will debut Vargas' Rosario film in theaters nationwide starting May 2nd, 2025 coming up soon. Anyone interested? Find more posts in: Horror, Indies, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
