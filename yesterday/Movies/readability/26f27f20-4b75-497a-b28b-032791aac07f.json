I’m absolutely thrilled to share Dick Dynamite with an audience that it truly deserves! This film is more than just a low-budget underground project; it represents the dedication and passion of an entire community that came together to create something special.\" –Director Robbie Davidson It's the first day of April in 1945, the Axis shaken after a round of blockbusters decimate buildings around the Nazi occupied war-torn city of Kassel, Germany. A group of German soldiers huddle round to keep the heat, smoking cigarettes in buildings almost reduced to rubble telling tales of a one man wrecking ball who seems impervious to German bullets, striking fear into the hearts of Wehrmacht and Schutzstaffel alike. Who is this man? He is the Nazi-crushing, Panzer-eating Dick Dynamite (Gary Snars Allan). Dick Dynamite 1944 is written and directed by Scottish indie filmmaker Robbie Davidson, making his feature directorial debut after a few other short films previously. Produced by Jeffrey J. Ellen and Beans Goldblum. This project was funded by a Kickstarter campaign initially. This first premiered at the 2023 Night Visions Film Festival last year. Epic Pictures will debut Davidson's Dick Dynamite 1944 movie in select US theaters on December 6th, 2024, then on VOD starting on December 10th coming soon. Anyone down for this?
