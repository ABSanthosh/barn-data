  "text": "Elon Musk could soon be sitting opposite Jon Stewart on “The Daily Show.” After Stewart lambasted Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency during Monday night’s “Daily Show” broadcast, Musk supporters took to X calling for the Tesla founder to go toe-to-toe with the late-night pundit on air. Musk replied to one user Tuesday saying, “I will do it if the show airs unedited.” The next day, the official “Daily Show” X account responded to Musk, writing, “We’d be delighted!” While nothing is confirmed, it is safe to assume if Musk did go on “The Daily Show,” his reception would be less than welcoming. During his Monday night takedown of DOGE, which saw Stewart accidentally cut his hand open, Stewart tallied up all the wasted government dollars DOGE could save instead of targeting the jobs of “200,000” federal employees. “How about we just take $3 billion in subsidies we give to oil and gas companies that turn billions in profits,” Stewart said. “How long did that take? Oh, wait! How about we just close down the carried interest loophole on hedge funds? That’s $1.3 billion a year. Or how about we stop the $2 trillion dollars we’ve given to defense contractors to build a fighter jet that blows, when everyone knows the next war is going to be fought with drones and blockchains, whatever that is! Holy shit! I can’t believe it! I just saved us billions of dollars in 11 seconds!” Popular on Variety Watch Stewart’s fiery takedown of Musk’s DOGE in its entirety below.",
