  "text": "Players are interested in knowing the hints and answers for the NYT Connections for March 21. The word game debuted in the New York Times in June 2023 and quickly became one of the most popular aspects of the publication. To solve the game, the players must correctly sort a 16-word grid into four groups or categories of four. Each of these categories is represented by a color that, in turn, represents a difficulty level. For instance, the Purple Category is the easiest of the hardest, and yellow is the easiest. Here are the clues that will help you solve the March 21st edition of NYT’s Connections. Connections hints for March 21 The hints for March 21 Connections are as follows: Yellow Category Related to someone’s special environment. Green Category Someone influential. Blue Category Objects used in a particular profession. Purple Category A business establishment acting like a prefix. What are the Connections answers for today, March 21? The following are the NYT Connections answers for today, March 21: Yellow Category: Milieu CIRCLE, SCENE, SPHERE, and WORLD Green Category: Luminary GREAT, ICON, LEGEND, and LION. Blue Category: Architectural Drawing Tools COMPASS, RULER, STENCIL, and T-SQUARE Purple Category:  Bar _____ CHART, EXAM, MITZVAH, and SOAP It isn’t that today’s NYT Connections was easier than other editions, but admittedly, luck favors quite a bit today. You may initially try to group CIRCLE with COMPASS and RULER believing that that the common theme might be “objects found in a geometry box.” However, that evidently isn’t the case, and you can almost inadvertently figure out the Blue Category first. The Yellow one is solved next as CIRCLE, SPHERE, and WORLD are very similar words, and they share a very predictable connection with SCENE. With Green Category, things become quite easy when you realize the thematic link between GREAT, ICON, AND LEGEND, and figure out how they are similar to LION. The four words left behind are obviously part of the Purple Category, and it effectively solves itself.",
