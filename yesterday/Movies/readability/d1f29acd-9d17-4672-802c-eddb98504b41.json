  "text": "Posted in: Disney+, Movies, TV | Tagged: agatha all along, WandaVisionCheck out a sneak peek clip and preview images for the seventh episode of Showrunner Jac Schaeffer's Kathryn Hahn-starring Agatha All Along. As folks continue to process what they learned about Joe Locke's \"Teen\"/Billy Maximoff and what his plans are for the end of The Witches' Road, we have a clip and three preview images to pass along for the seventh episode of Showrunner Jac Schaeffer's Kathryn Hahn-starring Agatha All Along – set to hit screens in only a few hours. In the clip from the Schaeffer-directed, Gia King and Cameron Squires-penned next chapter, Lilia (Patti LuPone) explains what the cards can tell them about the journey ahead – with Agatha (Hahn), Billy (Locke), and Jen (Sasheer Zamata) actually not having anything snarky to add in response. And yes, in case you're wondering, the four are dressed in witch costumes you should recognize… (L-R) Agatha Harkness (Kathryn Hahn) and Billy Maximoff (Joe Locke) in Marvel Television's AGATHA ALL ALONG, exclusively on Disney+.

Agatha All Along Showrunner on That Mephisto Reference What is it about MCU fans and their obsession with Mephisto? Rumblings about the all-powerful demon appearing (with Sacha Baron Cohen's name attached at one point) began around the time that 2021's Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen-starring WandaVision first hit Disney+ screens – with expectations building with each passing episode. Except – it didn't happen. In fact, director Matt Shakman made it clear that Mephisto was never part of the plan to begin with. \"There were some deep readings of the text that led to certain conclusions that were wrong,\" Shakman shared during an interview with Inverse. \"Mephisto was never a part of our plan. So that was a head-scratcher. But hey, he's a great character.\" But it didn't end there, with Mephisto being mentioned as appearing in Dominique Thorne-starring Ironheart (connected to Anthony Ramos' The Hood) and Showrunner Jac Schaeffer's Kathryn Hahn-starring Agatha All Along. Image: Marvel Comics; Marvel Television With Ironheart not expected to hit screens until 2025 and Agatha All Along currently streaming its third episode, the spotlight has shifted to the \"WandaVision\" spinoff – and rightfully so. Hahn had teased the possibility in the past, and the episode \"Through Many Miles / Of Tricks and Trials\" (directed by Rachel Goldberg and written by Cameron Squires) dumped a whole lot of fuel on a lot of fans' dumpster fires of random speculation. During an interview with EW, Schaeffer addressed whether the reference was done simply as a nod to the fans or if there are larger meanings that can be taken from it. During the first trial on the Witches' Road, Jennifer Kale (Sasheer Zamata) looks to get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding Teen's (Joe Locke) real identity – made that much harder by Teen having a sigil cast on him that keeps him from sharing any personal intel about himself (we've learned a whole lot more about that since then). While considering the options, Kale offers up the possibility that Teen could be \"an agent of Mephisto\" (yeah, the reference was far from subtle). \"With these shows, so often there is something that is at once a joke and a wink and a nod, and actually has something legitimate underneath it,\" Schaeffer shared during the interview. \"As we all know, Mephisto is a character who's very wrapped into Agatha's storyline. I mean, people have to watch, but we're always playing with the audience in that way.\" When you factor in the \"black heart\" references made regarding Aubrey Plaza's Rio Vidal (with the character Blackheart being one of Mephisto's kids), this might just be something for viewers to keep on their radar.

While considering the options, Kale offers up the possibility that Teen could be \u0026#34;an agent of Mephisto\u0026#34; (yeah, the reference was far from subtle). \u0026#34;With these shows, so often there is something that is at once a joke and a wink and a nod, and actually has something legitimate underneath it,\u0026#34; Schaeffer shared during the interview. \u0026#34;As we all know, Mephisto is a character who\u0026#39;s very wrapped into Agatha\u0026#39;s storyline. I mean, people have to watch, but we\u0026#39;re always playing with the audience in that way.\u0026#34; When you factor in the \u0026#34;black heart\u0026#34; references made regarding \u003cstrong\u003eAubrey Plaza\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026#39;s Rio Vidal (with the character Blackheart being one of Mephisto\u0026#39;s kids), this might just be something for viewers to keep on their radar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr/\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"bc_sharing_is_caring\"\u003e\u003ccenter\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnjoyed this?
