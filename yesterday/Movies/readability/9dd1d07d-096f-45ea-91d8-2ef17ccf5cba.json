Villeneuve joins producers Tanya Lapointe, Amy Pascal, and David Heyman in leading the iconic 007 franchise forward. The director, known for Dune and Blade Runner 2049, describes James Bond as ‚Äúsacred territory‚Äù and a longtime passion. Amazon MGM Studios‚Äô decision marks a new era for Bond, following its creative takeover from Eon Productions. It seems that Amazon MGM Studios wouldn't let the rumor mill spin for too long. It was officially confirmed in February that Amazon MGM Studios had acquired complete creative control of James Bond, and things were in motion. Since then, the 'who will direct' and 'who will star' articles have been rampant. Thank god we only had to wait four months for a confirmation for a director, since that will cut down on some of the speculation articles, and it's a director who might be at the top of his game right now. Denis Villeneuve will direct the next James Bond film for Amazon MGM Studios. He is also an executive producer, alongside Tanya Lapoint, with producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman, who were already confirmed earlier this year. \"Amazon MGM Studios sets Denis Villeneuve as director of next James Bond film. Villeneuve will also serve as executive producer, alongside Tanya Lapointe. As previously announced, Amy Pascal and David Heyman will serve as producers.\" \"Some of my earliest movie-going memories are connected to 007. I grew up watching James Bond films with my father, ever since 'Dr. No' with Sean Connery. I'm a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he's sacred territory,\" Villeneuve said (via Variety). \"I intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come. This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor. Amy, David, and I are absolutely thrilled to bring him back to the screen. Thank you to Amazon MGM Studios for their trust.\" Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, added, \"We are honored that Denis has agreed to direct James Bond's next chapter. He is a cinematic master, whose filmography speaks for itself. From¬†'Blade Runner 2049'¬†to¬†'Arrival'¬†to the¬†'Dune'¬†films, he has delivered compelling worlds, dynamic visuals, complex characters, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîthe immersive storytelling that global audiences yearn to experience in theaters. James Bond is in the hands of one of today's greatest filmmakers and we cannot wait to get started on 007's next adventure.\" Pascal and Heyman said, \"Denis Villeneuve has been in love with James Bond movies since he was a little boy. It was always his dream to make this movie, and now it's ours, too. We are lucky to be in the hands of this extraordinary filmmaker.\" The reception to James Bond leaving Eon Production and the control of producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli¬†was mixed at the time. People assumed that Amazon would lean into its worst instincts and immediately greenlight spinoff television shows and whatnot. Right now, it's still unclear whether or not they will end up going down that road, movie studios are going to movie studios after all, but signing on a talent like Villeneuve is a big step in the right direction. Villeneuve is at a point in his career where he could have easily said, 'no,' so he was either drawn to the script, treatment, or elevator pitch that Amazon MGM Studios gave him, or he has an idea he really wants to tell. Either way, one speculation article down, the march for the casting continues on. Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!
