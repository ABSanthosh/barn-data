  "description": "\"What's the point of pampering myself at my age?\" Cohen Media Group has unveiled an official US trailer for an indie French film called Rose, which is finally getting a US release this winter. It originally premiered way back in 2021 at the Locarno Film Festival where it won an award - but hasn't even been released in the last 4 years. It most recently played at as the Closing Night Film at Lincoln Center's New York Jewish Film Festival. Directed by musician and actress Aurélie Saada, this is her feature directorial debut. When Rose, 78, loses her husband, her grief inspires her to live as fully as possible and go out and pamper herself again. Her children disapprove, forcing them all to confront what it means to redefine oneself later in life. The film is described as being similar to Thelma or Driving Madeleine - they're \"emotionally moving and powerful, filled with laughter, tears and smiles throughout.\" This stars Françoise Fabian as the titular Rose, with Aure Atika, Grégory Montel, Damien Chapelle, Mehdi Nebbou, and Pascal Elbé. Get a look below. Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Aurélie Saada's film Rose, direct from CMG's YouTube: Starring Award […]",
