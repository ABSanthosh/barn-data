  "text": "Chris Evans is bummed he is missing out on all the fun in “Avengers: Doomsday.” In a recent conversation with ScreenRant, Evans, who played Captain America across eight MCU films, was asked if he still stays in contact with his former Marvel collaborators, considering his exclusion from the highly anticipated “Avengers: Doomsday.” Evans confirmed that they all keep in touch, but added it feels different having exited the franchise in “Avengers: Endgame.” “Yeah, I talk to them all the time,” Evans said. “It’s where Pedro [Pascal] is right now. I mean, it’s sad to be away. It’s sad to not be back with the band, but I’m sure they’re doing something incredible, and I’m sure it’s going to be that much harder when it comes out, and you feel like you weren’t invited to the party.” Popular on Variety In “End Game,” Evans’ Captain America ages out of the star-spangled shield after traveling back in time to return the Infinity Stones. He decides to stay in the past with his true love, Peggy Carter, and in the present day, passes the Captain America moniker to Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson. While Evans is staying behind, his “Avengers” co-stars Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr. are returning for “Doomsday.” Hemsworth will return as Thor, but Downey will come back as the titular super villain Doctor Doom, instead of Iron Man. Other familiar MCU faces returning for “Doomsday” include Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier; Paul Rudd as Ant-Man; Tom Hiddleston as Loki; Letitia Wright as Shuri and Mackie as Captain America. While originally set for release on May 1, 2026, “Doomsday” was recently delayed to Dec. 18, 2026. Its sequel, “Avengers: Secret Wars,” was also pushed. First slated to premiere on May 7, 2027, the film will now hit theaters Dec. 17, 2027.",
