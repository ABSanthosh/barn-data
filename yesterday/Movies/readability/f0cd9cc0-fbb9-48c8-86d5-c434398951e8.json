  "text": "Cynthia Erivo revealed that the upcoming Wicked sequel Wicked: For Good will feature an original song co-written by her and the Broadway play’s original composer. What do we know about Cynthia Erivo’s song in Wicked: For Good? Speaking to Variety on its Awards Circuit Podcast, Erivo — who plays Elphaba in both 2024’s Wicked and next year’s sequel — revealed that she and Schwartz worked together on an original song for the character. While she didn’t expand too much on the song, she says that it gets to the heart of Elphaba and who she is. “I collaborated on one of the new songs, and it’s so special to me,” Erivo said. “When we filmed it, the entire crew was in tears. I hope audiences are ready — it’s a song that speaks to the heart of who Elphaba is.” Wicked: For Good is currently set for release on November 21, 2025. Wicked is directed by Jon M. Chu from a screenplay written by the musical’s book writer Winnie Holzman. It is based on Maguire’s bestselling novel and the Tony-winning stage musical. The ensemble cast is led by Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, who play Galinda Upland and Elphaba Thropp in the film, respectively. The rest of the cast includes Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible, Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero Tigelaar, Jeff Goldblum as the Wizard of Oz, Peter Dinklage as Doctor Dillamond, Bowen Yang as Pfannee, Keala Settle as Miss Coddle, Marissa Bode as Nessarose Thropp, Bronwyn James as ShenShen, Ethan Slater as Boq, and more. “The film tells the untold story of the witches of Oz: Elphaba, a young woman, misunderstood because of her unusual green skin, who has yet to discover her true power; and Glinda, a popular young woman, gilded by privilege and ambition, who has yet to discover her true heart,” reads the official synopsis. “The two meet as students at Shiz University in the fantastical Land of Oz and forge an unlikely but profound friendship. Following an encounter with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, their friendship reaches a crossroads and their lives take very different paths.” Glinda’s unflinching desire for popularity sees her seduced by power, while Elphaba’s determination to remain true to herself, and to those around her, will have unexpected and shocking consequences on her future. Their extraordinary adventures in Oz will ultimately see them fulfill their destinies as Glinda the Good and the Wicked Witch of the West.” (Source: Variety)",
