  "text": "The White House’s official social media commemorated Donald Trump‘s visit with Vince Vaughn by sharing a parody poster for Vaughn’s 2005 comedy “Wedding Crashers.” Friday, the “Swingers” star stopped by the Oval Office to meet with the POTUS. Following their chat, the official White House X and Instagram accounts shared a spoof “Wedding Crashers” poster titled “White House Crashers.” It featured a photo of Vaughn with Trump in the place of Owen Wilson. The caption of the posts read, “President Donald J. Trump \u0026 Vince Vaughn in the Oval Office.” No details were shared about the purpose of the visit, nor was Vaughn on Trump’s list of scheduled guests. Popular on Variety While it’s impossible to say if the “Bad Monkey” star voted for Trump, Vaughn, a self-proclaimed libertarian, has previously discussed his political values. Speaking with The New York Times in 2024, he said, “I definitely am a believer more in allowing individuals to make choices. So I think that drugs should be legal and people should have guns…I’d rather say let people make their choices, and they can make different choices and have the consequences of their choices.” In 2020, the actor faced backlash after he was seen shaking hands with Trump at a Louisiana State football game. Following the interaction, Vaughn spoke to the Los Angeles Times to explain himself. “It was the only time I’ve ever met him. We said hello. He was very personable. I didn’t get into policies,” he said. “I don’t have a party that I support and endorse. In fact, for me sometimes it’s difficult to find a candidate that you feel is philosophically consistent and not just going along with whoever is funding their particular party. That’s as much as I’ll get into it at this point.”",
