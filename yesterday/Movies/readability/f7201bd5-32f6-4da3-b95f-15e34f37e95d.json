  "text": "Many are wondering why wide receiver Diontae Johnson refused to play in the Ravens-Eagles game. On Wednesday, December 4, GM Eric DeCosta of the Baltimore Ravens announced on X (formerly Twitter) that Johnson would be suspended for an upcoming game against the New York Giants for “conduct detrimental to the team.” He said that it was a “difficult decision,” but the penalty was handed out due to him choosing not to play despite being active. Here’s a breakdown of why experts say that Johnson decided not to step out on the field. Why was Diontae Johnson suspended by the Ravens? Experts say Diontae Johnson chose not to play in the Eagles game, leading to his suspension, because he has been frustrated by “his lack of usage since arriving in a trade.” It is my understanding that Diontae Johnson has been frustrated in Baltimore due to his lack of usage since arriving in a trade. Baltimore has taken action by suspending him for a game, but more conversations are likely to happen as they head into their bye week, determining… https://t.co/9a85x1KAHR— Jordan Schultz (@Schultz_Report) December 4, 2024 This is according to Jordan Schultz, a FOX Sports NFL insider, who adds on X that after his suspension that “more conversations are likely to happen” as to whether the receiver will stay with the team. He notes that the Ravens reportedly believe that he will still “help them down the stretch,” but want him to be fully committed and team-focused, particularly given that this a contract year for Johnson. At the time of the Eagles game, many were confused as to why Johnson was not in the game. Quarterback Lamar Jackson, per Ebony Bird, said that he wanted Johnson on the field as “he’s a great receiver.” However, Johnson only played 17 snaps in his debut game for the Ravens in Week 9 and his appearances in games afterwards were low. Since being acquired from the Carolina Panthers on October 29, he has only played a total of 39 snaps and has only caught had one catch for six yards despite being a lead receiver for the Panthers. One fan of Johnson claims on X that the Ravens only traded for him not to use him, but to block other teams from getting him. That said, users on the Steelers Reddit say that Johnson, who played for the team from 2019 to 2013, has a reputation of being a “problematic player” who “threw fits when things didn’t go his way.” Some comment that it’s ironic for a player to refuse playing in a game because they’re not playing in games.",
