  "text": "Annet McCroskey, a veteran talent manager, producer and mentor who was CEO of Artistic Endeavors, died July 11 a few weeks after being hospitalized for an unspecified sudden medical emergency. She was 51. As CEO of talent management and production company Artistic Endeavors, McCroskey was dedicated to empowering and fostering the dreams of young actors. Her clients scored roles for streamers, cable and broadcast nets and features. Her influence extended to mentoring aspiring talent managers and female entrepreneurs, helping them grow their businesses and navigate the challenges of the entertainment industry. She received the prestigious Heller Award for Manager of the Year in 2015 and served as President of the Talent Managers Association from 2013-15. She also served on TMA’s board for more than 15 years and held leadership and advisory roles with numerous organizations. Among them were SAG’s The Entertainment Community Fund’s Looking Ahead Program for young performers, Sundance Institute, Film Independent, HRTS and Women in Film on both coasts. McCroskey also was an Emmy-voting member of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. She also was a producer of the feature Locating Silver Lake and had other producing credits including TV specials and short films. McCroskey recently partnered with Rise Flix to create a platform for the next generation of independent filmmakers. Her family said McCroskey “championed causes including Indigenous, LGBTQ+, children’s and women’s rights, as well as environmental stewardship. She encouraged her clients to give back to their own communities, creating a ripple effect of generosity and activism, [and she was] more than an industry powerhouse — she was a wife, mother, mentor and radiant light who believed deeply in people’s potential.” McCroskey is survived by her husband, Aaron, and sons Angelo and Aidan. A memorial service is being planned for later this summer in Los Angeles.",
