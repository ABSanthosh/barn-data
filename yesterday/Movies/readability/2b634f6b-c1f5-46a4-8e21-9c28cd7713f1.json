  "description": "\"The Avengers are not coming. Who will keep people safe?\" These guys? Doubt it. Marvel has debuted a wacky joke (or not?) trailer for Thunderbolts*, the kooky anti-hero MCU movie kicking off the summer movie season on May 2nd. This whole trailer is a riff on A24's trailers with the same style \u0026 title cards. A ragtag group of bad guys is sent on covert missions for the American government. The fun ensemble cast includes David Harbour as Red Guardian, Hannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr / Ghost, Wyatt Russell as U.S. Agent, Sebastian Stan as Bucky, Lewis Pullman as Bob aka \"Sentry\", and Florence Pugh as Black Widow Yelena Belova, plus Olga Kurylenko as Taskmaster, Geraldine Viswanathan as Mel, and finally Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the handler Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. The trailer points out this has: The Green Knight cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo, Hereditary production designer Grace Yun, Minari editor Harry Yoon, and Everything Everywhere All At Once composer Son Lux. Which is a good line-up. But it still doesn't make me want to watch another Marvel movie? Even if this trailer is just for fun, it does seem like Marvel is getting a bit desperate trying to get anyone [â€¦]",

Which is a good line-up. But it still doesn't make me want to watch another Marvel movie? Even if this trailer is just for fun, it does seem like Marvel is getting a bit desperate trying to get anyone to care about their movies anymore... Here's the \"Absolute Cinema\" trailer (+ new poster) for Jake Schreier's Thunderbolts*, from YouTube: You can rewatch the teaser trailer for Marvel's Thunderbolts* movie right here and the D23 promo trailer. \"Careful who you assemble.\" A world without Avengers doesn't mean there's not a group of superheroes. There is a group and they're called the Thunderbolts. A group of supervillains from the MCU are recruited to go on missions for the government. Thunderbolts* is directed by American filmmaker Jake Schreier, director of the movies Robot \u0026 Frank, Paper Towns, and also Chance the Rapper in Chance the Rapper's Magnificent Coloring World previously, plus lots of music videos \u0026 TV work including episodes of \"Brand New Cherry Flavor\", \"Minx\", \"Dave\", and \"Beef\" most recently. The screenplay is written by Eric Pearson, Lee Sung Jin, and Joanna Calo. Based on the Marvel Comics Thunderbolts created by Kurt Busiek and Mark Bagley. Produced by Kevin Feige for Marvel Studios. Disney will debut Marvel's new Thunderbolts* movie in theaters worldwide starting on May 2nd, 2025 early this summer. How was that trailer? Anyone excited?
