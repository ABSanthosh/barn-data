  "text": "After more than 50 years of friendship, Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong have had their fair share of ups and downs. While discussing their new documentary Cheech \u0026 Chong’s Last Movie, premiering April 25 in theaters after a 4/20 limited release, the stoner comedy duo discussed how they’ve maintained their creative partnership and brotherhood through the years. “Well, that’s really what it is,” Marin told ComingSoon.net. “We’re brothers. We’re not best friends. You know, like we grew up together. We’re brothers, and we treated each other like brothers.” Watch on Deadline Marin continued, “Sometimes you want your brother to shut up, and sometimes you want your brother to help you [laughs]. So that’s kind of how we how we grew up, is we both understood that at the beginning ’cause I mean, viewing the conversation we’re having in this movie is no different from any conversation we might’ve had throughout our career. We were always kind of battling, and that’s kind of where the pearl emerges, when there’s irritation in the shell.” Directed by David L. Bushell, Cheech \u0026 Chong’s Last Movie features conversations with the titular duo, reflecting on their decades-long friendship and success as a comedy duo that met working at Chong’s family strip club in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1969. ‘Cheech and Chong‘s Last Movie’ Courtesy of Keep Smokin’ After moving to Los Angeles and releasing a number of comedy albums, the pair released their first feature Up in Smoke in 1978. The film was followed by Cheech and Chong’s Next Movie (1980), Nice Dreams (1981), Things Are Tough All Over (1982), Still Smokin (1983) and Cheech \u0026 Chong’s The Corsican Brothers (1984).
