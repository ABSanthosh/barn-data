  "text": "SPOILER ALERT: Details follow for Season 13, Episode 9 of “The Masked Singer,” “Decades Night,” which aired April 9 on Fox. “The Masked Singer” is a very different kind of reality show from “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.” But for Erika Jayne — unmasked as Yorkie on Wednesday night’s edition of Fox’s reality singing competition — it took “zero convincing” to join. “Why wouldn’t I?” she told Variety. “Did you see my costume? It was absolutely adorable. ‘The Masked Singer’ is a top-notch production. It was probably one of the best times I’ve ever had performing and doing a show like this. Why not take this great opportunity?” For Yorkie, Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg got it right with Erika Jayne. Robin Thicke guessed Lori Loughlin. Rita Ora named Paris Hilton. Ken Jeong went with Kyle Richards. Popular on Variety Jayne said performing in the costume was the most challenging part, as “the mask was quite heavy, and the boots were big. The real challenge was singing in time, in tune, hitting the choreography without crashing or falling over.” As for the fact that McCarthy-Wahlberg — a “Housewives” superfan — figured her out, “I have a very distinct voice, and you can only hide it for so long.” Jayne’s appearance on “The Masked Singer” comes as she and fellow “Housewives” star Bozoma Saint James created some controversy on “Watch What Happens Live.” When host Andy Cohen asked the duo about the exit of castmate Garcelle Beauvais, their silence – and then catty answers – drew backlash from fans. “Listen, I was responding to Garcelle’s previous week, where she said, ‘Fuck Erika,’” Jayne said. “My response is my response.” Erika Jayne as Yorkie joins Method Man as Stud Muffin, Candace Cameron Bure as Cherry Blossom, James Van Der Beek as Griffin, Flavor Flav as Space Ranger, Sheana Shay as Bat, Aubrey O’Day as Ant, Oscar de la Hoya as Fuzzy Peas and Cedric the Entertainer as Honey Pot as the celebrities unmasked on “The Masked Singer” Season 13. “Decades Night” was also the Group C finale, which kicked off with the three remaining performers singing “My Sharona,” by the Knack. Later, the first singer who moved on to the “Lucky Six” was Mad Scientist Monster. That left Yorkie and Nessy to face off in the Battle Royale, as they too turns performing “Hard to Handle,” by Otis Redding. Nessy won that round, sending Yorkie home. That means the “Lucky Six” has now been chosen: Group A winners Coral and Paparazzo, Group B winners Pearl and Boogie Woogie, and Group C winners Mad Scientist Monster and Nessy. Back for Season 13 are host Nick Cannon, alongside panelists Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, Rita Ora and Robin Thicke. Ora was at the desk for a third consecutive season to fill in for Nicole Scherzinger. New this season, a mysterious masked character dubbed “Detective Lucky Duck” will appear throughout the season to give clues and help the panelists “quack” the case of who’s under the masks. This week, Season 3 contestant Bret Michaels appeared to give a clue for Nessy: “I have rocked out with this person many times. If you don’t get this one, I’ll be shocked.” Later, Lucky Duck showed up with the Golden Ear trophy, noting that it will be back in play for the panelists (whomever has the most correct guesses this season will win). Also new: The “Crack the Case” clue cases, in which more clues are shared about the eliminated contestant. For Yorkie, the clue was a pair of black knee-high boots. “These lucky boots are custom made for me. My show boots, they’re made for walking. They got me through a whole lot. Wherever I go, even the biggest Strip.” “The Masked Singer” Season 13 themed episodes include a tribute to franchises “Shrek” and “Ghostbusters,” as well as the Grand Ole Opry as it hits its 100th anniversary. Also on tap are a tribute to the Rat Pack and themes such as “Voices of Olympus: Unmasking of the Gods,” “Carnival,” “Boy Bands,” “Decades,” “Lucky 6 Speed Guessing,” a “Clash of the Masks” and the return of “Soundtrack of My Life.” Masked contestants in Season 13 include Honey Pot, Space Ranger, Cherry Blossom, Coral, Fuzzy Peas, Ant, Paparazzo, Griffin, Boogie Woogie, Pearl, Bat, Yorkie, Stud Muffin, Nessy and Mad Scientist Monster. Here were the performances on Wednesday’s Episode 9, “Decades Night”: Yorkie, “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) Song: “Stop! In the Name of Love,” by the Supremes Panel guesses: Lori Loughlin, Kyle Richards, Erika Jayne Time machine clue: “Show Dog.” “I’m a show dog. I’m part of one of the biggest TV shows out there.” Yorkie voiceover: “I chose the ‘60s because they remind me of my mom. I instantly picture her as a young woman, falling in love and getting married. That white picket fence dream of the decade. But just a few years later when I was born, it all fell apart when my dad walked out. Leaving my mom to raise a baby on her own. It was never the same. She used her pain as a cautionary tale. She taught me to be guarded with my heart and keep love on a short leash. To think things over. Because every chance at love was a bigger chance at heartbreak. So I grew up fast. Some would say I was cold. And I resented that part of myself for many years. I’ve had to learn how to let people in. And after my own mess with love, I can now appreciate where my mom was coming from. She was just trying to protect me. So this song’s for her, my ultimate protector.” Previous voiceover: “When this New Yorkie broke onto the scene, baby I was adored. Until I found myself wrapped up in a major scandal, paying for someone else’s choices, someone I loved. My name was in the news, the gossip sites, even on the billboards around town. And let’s be real, I was dragged through the dirt. But I stayed true to myself and did everything I could to keep my chin up. I’m most proud of that. And as it always does, the truth came out. Life can be messy. Love can be messier. But you can also survive. Once you have a strong foundation, you can rebuild step by step and come out stronger. And I’m proof of that.” Previous songs: “Hot To Go!,” by Chappell Roan; “Step By Step,” by New Kids on the Block Previous panel guesses: Chelsea Handler, Paris Hilton, Kyle Richards, Teresa Giudice, Paris Hilton, Erika Jayne Mad Scientist Monster, “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) Mad Scientist Monster Song: “Love Yourself,” by Justin Bieber Panel guesses: Brad Paisley, Blake Shelton, Billy Ray Cyrus Time machine clue: “Season 4.” “I’ve performed with someone from Season 4.” Mad Scientist Monster voiceover: “I chose the 2010s because they were lit. Electric cars hit the roads and smart phones hit the stores. It’s one of the best decades of my career. It seemed like I could conquer the world. I won every award possible, except that Nobel prize. But I didn’t do it alone. And while we had a good run together, it didn’t last forever. We had very different theories on life. I wanted to explore new avenues, and keep our grand experiment going. But we never tested that hypothesis, so I ventured out on my own. At first I was mad. But life rolls on. And one I went out on my own, I found I quite liked I was in control of my results. Now, I realize I learned a major lesson. Sometimes chemistry changes and that’s OK. And, not everybody’s going to love you, and that’s OK too. As long as you love yourself.” Previous songs: “Unwell,” by Matchbox Twenty; “I Swear,” by All-4-One Previous panel guesses: Luke Combs, Luke Bryan, Blake Shelton, Alan Jackson, Tim McGraw, Keith Urban Nick Cannon and Nessy, “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) Nessy Song: “Can’t Fight This Feeling,” by REO Speedwagon Panel guesses: Dave Matthews, Daryl Hall, Pat Monahan Time machine clue: “Bieber \u0026 Puth.” “They’re just a couple of kids who famously covered my music. And I got to score some cool dad points.” Nessy voiceover: “The 80s, a decade of mullets, MTV and camcorders. That’s why I chose it. Back then you’d blast a love song from a boom box outside your crush’s bedroom window just to let them know how you feel. And for me, growing up there was one band blasting from my boom box. The mighty REO Speedwagon. I even got to open for them. Their music taught me how to put lyrics to the feeling of love. Something I became known for in my career. Valentine’s Day is practically my Super Bowl. God only knows how many couples have walked down the aisle to my song. When it came time for me to say my own I dos, you better believe there was one band that made the playlist: REO Speedwagon. So tonight I’m honoring them. And I can’t fight the feeling anymore that I’d really like to go on in this competition.” Previous song: “Roxanne,” by The Police; “Tearin’ Up My Heart,” by *NSYNC Previous panel guesses: Gene Simmons, Dan Reynolds, Daryl Hall, Dave Matthews, Darius Rucker, Pat Monahan In Season 12, Boyz II Men (as the Buffalo) won the Masked trophy, beating out Mario, as the Wasp, who was this season’s runner-up. They joined AJ Michalka as Strawberry Shortcake; Kobie Turner as Goo, Jana Kramer as Royal Knight, Bronson Arroyo as Sherlock Hound, Drake Bell as Ice King, Bethany Hamilton as Macaron, Natalie Imbruglia as Bluebell, Laverne Cox as Chess Piece, Andy Richter as Dusty Bunny, Paula Cole as Ship, Marsai Martin as Woodpecker, Yvette Nicole Brown as Showbird and John Elway as Leaf Sheep as the celebrities unmasked on “The Masked Singer” Season 12. “The Masked Singer” comes from Fox Alternative Entertainment. Rosie Seitchik, Craig Plestis and Cannon are executive producers, while Seitchik serves as showrunner. The series is based on the South Korean format created by Mun Hwa Broadcasting Corp.",

But we never tested that hypothesis, so I ventured out on my own. At first I was mad. But life rolls on. And one I went out on my own, I found I quite liked I was in control of my results. Now, I realize I learned a major lesson. Sometimes chemistry changes and that’s OK. And, not everybody’s going to love you, and that’s OK too. As long as you love yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003ePrevious songs: \u003c/strong\u003e“Unwell,” by Matchbox Twenty; “I Swear,” by All-4-One\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003ePrevious panel guesses:\u003c/strong\u003e Luke Combs, Luke Bryan, Blake Shelton, Alan Jackson, Tim McGraw, Keith Urban\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?w=1024\" data-lazy-src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px\" height=\"683\" width=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg 3000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?resize=1920,1280 1920w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?resize=1360,907 1360w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?resize=910,607 910w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?resize=681,454 681w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MS-S13_EP1306-Show_00381f_f.jpg?resize=250,167 250w\"/\u003e\n\t\n\t\n\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cfigcaption\u003e\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003eNick Cannon and Nessy, “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox)\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\t\u003ch2\u003e\n\t\t\u003cstrong\u003eNessy\u003c/strong\u003e\t\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eSong: \u003c/strong\u003e“Can’t Fight This Feeling,” by REO Speedwagon\n\n\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003ePanel guesses:\u003c/strong\u003e Dave Matthews, Daryl Hall, Pat Monahan\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eTime machine clue\u003c/strong\u003e: “Bieber \u0026amp; Puth.” “They’re just a couple of kids who famously covered my music.

That’s why I chose it. Back then you’d blast a love song from a boom box outside your crush’s bedroom window just to let them know how you feel. And for me, growing up there was one band blasting from my boom box. The mighty REO Speedwagon. I even got to open for them. Their music taught me how to put lyrics to the feeling of love. Something I became known for in my career. Valentine’s Day is practically my Super Bowl. God only knows how many couples have walked down the aisle to my song. When it came time for me to say my own I dos, you better believe there was one band that made the playlist: REO Speedwagon. So tonight I’m honoring them.
