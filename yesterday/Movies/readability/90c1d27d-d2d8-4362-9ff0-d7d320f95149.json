  "text": "Charli XCX called out ITV at the Brit Awards after winning artist of the year, claiming that the broadcaster was “complaining about my nipples.” The “Guess” singer, who rocked a sheer black dress to the ceremony, began her acceptance speech with: “I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples. I feel like we’re in the era of free the nipple though, right?” When applause then started, Charli added, “They put the clap track on, cool. Thanks for being on my side.” ITV did not immediately respond to Variety’s request for comment on the matter. The pop star was the big winner of this year’s Brits, taking home five total awards, including album and song of the year as well as the previously announced songwriter award. Elsewhere in her artist of the year acceptance speech, Charli thanked those that helped her hit “Brat” album come to life, including producers A.G. Cook and Finn Keane as well as her fiancé and collaborator George Daniel. Popular on Variety “I gotta say, I feel like I’ve always been an artist but it really takes a whole team, and they’re all sat at that table. So I just want to say thank you so much to the people who helped me make this record,” she said. “And thank you to all the artists out there who feel like they don’t fit in, but are brave enough to try and be rejected a million times. I share this with you. Thank you so much. Keep partying.” Watch Charli’s full Brit Awards speech below.",
