  "description": "\"Our children are the casualties.\" Jolt Film, in partnership with Bloomberg, revealed an official trailer for a documentary film titled Can't Look Away, arriving for streaming to watch (online or in theaters) in April. The actual title is Can't Look Away: The Case Against Social Media – inspired by Olivia Carville's reporting on child safety online \u0026 social media for Bloomberg News / Businessweek. \"We all have a sense that social media is vaguely bad for kids – we thought so too. But making this has revealed the full extent of the harm.\" The film exposes the real-world consequences of dangerous social media algorithms that exploit \u0026 endanger vulnerable young users. \"This isn't just a tech problem – it's a full-blown public health disaster, and we're only beginning to grasp the consequences.\" Yep. This isn't the first doc about social media being harmful - Jeff Orlowski made the doc film The Social Dilemma a few years ago, and it's on Netflix now, but not that many people watched it. And sadly most people don't really want to have the tough conversation about how harmful social media really is, and not just for kids, but for all of society. We're all […]",

This isn't the first doc about social media being harmful - Jeff Orlowski made the doc film The Social Dilemma a few years ago, and it's on Netflix now, but not that many people watched it. And sadly most people don't really want to have the tough conversation about how harmful social media really is, and not just for kids, but for all of society. We're all addicted to it. Here's the official trailer for Matthew O'Neill \u0026 Perri Peltz's doc Can't Look Away, from YouTube: \"This documentary tells the painful stories of families seeking justice for their loved ones who have suffered unimaginable harm. Can't Look Away, which draws on Olivia Carville's extensive reporting, shines a much needed light on the way that tech giants still try to avoid responsibility for the content on their platforms, despite the enormously addictive power of the algorithms that they have built.\" –Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait The cautionary documentary Can't Look Away follows a team of lawyers battling several tech companies, fighting for families whose children suffered devastating harm – suicide, drug overdose, or exploitation – tied to social media. Through emotional testimonies and high-stakes legal battles, the film exposes the tension between corporate profit and child safety, revealing catastrophic failures. As families seek justice, Can't Look Away serves as a wake-up call about the dangers of social media and the very urgent need to protect its youngest users. Matthew O'Neill \u0026 Perri Peltz (also of Puppies Behind Bars, Warning: This Drug May Kill You), both directors of \"Axios\" on HBO and Surveilled doc with Ronan Farrow previously. Produced by Anna Casper, Matthew O'Neill \u0026 Perri Peltz. In July 2025, the film will debut to watch across Bloomberg's media platforms. Jolt Film will also release Can't Look Away in select US theaters (at DCTV’s Firehouse Cinema in NYC) and streaming on Jolt starting on April 4th, 2025 this spring. Who's intrigued?
