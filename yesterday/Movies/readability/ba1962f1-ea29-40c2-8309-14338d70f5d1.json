However, things turn upside down when their plan goes awry and makes them the targets of a giant narcotics enterprise. With the recent release of Episode 8, fans wish to know if there are any more episodes lined up, or maybe even a Part 2. Here’s all you need to know about whether there’s a possibility of Part 2 or additional episodes for Dope Thief. Dope Thief Episode 9 release date and time explained There isn’t a Dope Thief Episode 9 release date and time. This is because the series has ended, consisting of a total of eight episodes. Viewers were hoping there were an additional number of episodes or maybe even a Part 2. This was due to the streaming platform’s recent strategy of dividing television series into two or three parts. While Dope Thief fans were expecting the show to follow a similar route, it seems like that isn’t the case. Moreover, all the episodes went live on their scheduled release date and times. Has Dope Thief ended? Yes, Dope Thief has finished. The show aired its last episode on April 24, 2025. Fans are looking forward to what the future holds for the television series. However, a second season is unlikely as creator Peter Craig hasn’t adapted the second part of the novel yet. Craig stated to the Collider: “The second story isn’t there in this one. It’s just the first story all the way through with a bunch of changes in the back half. Dennis tells me he’s happy with that, so I think we’re OK. I’ve adapted a lot of authors, and I’m usually pretty careful about making sure they’re on board with everything, and he seemed to be on board with everything.” Nevertheless, fans can surely keep an eye out for an official update on the future of the crime drama from the makers. Where to watch previous Dope Thief episodes You can watch previous Dope Thief episodes via Apple TV Plus. Apple TV Plus is known for streaming acclaimed series like Ted Lasso, Severance, and For All Mankind, as well as movies and documentaries. Fans can access the platform for free through its 7-day trial, and also a 3-month trial that comes with the purchase of an Apple product. After the trial periods end, viewers need to buy a paid subscription. The series’ synopsis reads: “Two lifelong friends in Philadelphia pose as DEA agents to rob small-time drug dealers. It’s a perfect grift—until they choose the wrong mark and become targets of a massive narcotics enterprise.”",
