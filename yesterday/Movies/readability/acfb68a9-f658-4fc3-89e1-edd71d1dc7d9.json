  "text": "Meghan McCain can’t seem to quit talking about The View and is once again bringing up her former place of work, deeming it “the most dramatic show on the planet.” While appearing on 2 Way Tonight, the Republican claimed ABC News doesn’t have any true conservatives in their organization and noted she was the only one on the network when she co-hosted The View. “The only Republican that is acceptable at ABC News is an ex-one,” McCain said in a video she reposted on X, the microblogging platform formerly known as Twitter. “You can’t be a current, I voted for Trump. I am pro-life. I’m whatever,’ It is unacceptable and does not exist on the entirety of ABC News. I was the only one, me and Elizabeth Hasselbeck, that’s it.” McCain co-hosted The View between 2017 and 2021 as the outspoken conservative voice on the daytime talk show panel. However, McCain seemingly leaves out Abby Huntsman, who also identifies with conservative politics and was on the show between 2018 and 2020. Watch on Deadline Ana Navarro and Alyssa Farah Griffin are both currently on the panel and identify as Republicans. Legal notes have become a point of contention on The View, with Whoopi Goldberg calling out producer Brian Teta live on air, questioning why they must continue reading Donald Trump’s statement about the 2020 election. McCain addressed the legal notes during her appearance on 2 Way Tonight, saying she was going to give “a little behind-the-scenes gossip about the show.” The former co-host claimed these statements “are dramatic because it means you have said something on TV that is a lie and that you could be sued for—that ABC News could be sued for.” RELATED: Meghan McCain Shares “Juicy Gossip” Of ‘The View,’ Likens Co-Hosts To “Vultures” \u0026 Claims They Were “So Scared” Of Tulsi Gabbard “The executive producer physically runs on state, and there’s more times than not, an argument about whether or not the women will do it because they don’t want to do it because they don’t want to admit they’ve done anything wrong,” McCain alleges. “When I see Sunny [Hostin] on the show, pursing her lips and just looking like she is a hostage, I know she doesn’t want to do it and she’s within an inch of her life about to … that show’s the most dramatic show on the plat. There’s always fighting. There’s always drama.” McCain’s continued discussion of The View is a shift from her stance earlier this year, when she felt alluded to on the show after the show discussed trading on famous names. In a post on X, McCain asked her former colleagues to “move on” as “it [had] been years” since she had quit the show.
