  "text": "Amid the Kennedy Center‘s Trump-led regime change, Pride Month activities are looking a little different this year. Part of WorldPride 2025 festival in Washington DC, the Center’s Tapestry of Pride events that were scheduled for June 5 to 8 have been quietly cancelled or moved to other venues, according to the Associated Press. Still listed on the Kennedy Center’s website, the event is described as “a celebration of diversity and unity, weaving together performances, exhibitions, and experiences for all ages.” Watch on Deadline Deadline has reached out to the Center for comment. June Crenshaw, deputy director of DC’s Capital Pride Alliance, told the AP: “We are a resilient community, and we have found other avenues to celebrate. We are finding another path to the celebration … but the fact that we have to maneuver in this way is disappointing.” Donald Trump visited the Kennedy Center last month, following his appointment as the Center’s new chairman after he ousted half the organization’s board members, who were nominated by Joe Biden. Since Trump took over, Shonda Rhimes has resigned from the board of the Kennedy Center, and Issa Rae has canceled a show scheduled for the venue. Meanwhile, Trump has faced backlash from supporters of the Kennedy Center’s cancelled touring children’s musical Finn, the Gay Men’s Chorus of DC and International Pride Orchestra over scrapped performances. Trump previously threatened to make the Kennedy Center “GREAT AGAIN,” announcing his plan in February to remove those “who do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.” “We will soon announce a new Board, with an amazing Chairman, DONALD J. TRUMP!” he added. “Just last year, the Kennedy Center featured Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth — THIS WILL STOP. The Kennedy Center is an American Jewel, and must reflect the brightest STARS on its stage from all across our Nation. For the Kennedy Center, THE BEST IS YET TO COME!”",
