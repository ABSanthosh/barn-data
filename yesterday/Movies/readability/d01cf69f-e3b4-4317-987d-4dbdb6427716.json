  "text": "TikTokers around the world are crying over a video showing a small female anglerfish wading into the shallows of Tenerife last month in the Canary Islands. This phenomenon is extremely unusual because anglerfish are deep-sea creatures that typically reside 6,500 feet below sea level. Scientists have yet to provide an explanation for this behavioral anomaly, which has moved many to tears in recent weeks. Here’s everything we know about the anglerfish’s death, which has recently taken over the internet. TikTokers cry over anglerfish death Gen Z TikTokers are mourning the recent death of an anglerfish after it swam to the ocean’s surface. This marks the first time a member of this deep-sea species has been spotted so close to the ocean’s surface, shocking marine scientists. The little creature ultimately met its demise, leaving many netizens in tears. TikTokers around the globe have interpreted the video as a little fish wishing to experience the brighter surface, pushing with all its might to swim against the dark, deep-sea environment it naturally inhabits. Many TikTokers and social media users see this moment as moving and inspirational. Heartfelt and emotional comments have flooded the video. One user wrote, “I hope she knows a bunch of humans are so proud of her, even though it’s sad.” Another added, “She was headed into the light.” Psychotherapist Dr. Nivedita Nayak weighed in on the situation in an interview with Metro. She stated, “The anglerfish has spent its entire life in the deep, dark ocean, a place of survival and isolation. Now, it is swimming toward something brighter, something unknown, even though it will not survive the journey.” Reflecting on how this event has impacted millions across the globe, she added, “That moment feels deeply human. It speaks to endurance, resilience, and the idea of moving toward something greater, no matter the cost. Many people see themselves in that struggle, and it resonates on an emotional level.”",
