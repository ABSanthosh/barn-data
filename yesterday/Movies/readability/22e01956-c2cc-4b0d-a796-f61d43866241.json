The Scream 2 and Buffy alum shared a photo from the set of the slasher film, which will be directed by her close friend Jennifer Kaytin Robinson. “Scooby Doo 3 coming soon….,” Gellar jokingly captioned her Instagram post, which features a chair with the I Know What You Did Last Summer logo. Gellar’s husband, Freddie Prinze Jr., is set to reprise his role in the 1997 film. However, Gellar recently said in an interview she would not be returning to play beauty queen Helen Shivers. “I am dead,” Gellar told People about the fate her character faced in the film. Watch on Deadline Due to her closeness with the director and Prinze Jr., Gellar said she would be part of the sequel in an “unofficial” capacity.

The sequel’s cast includes Chase Sui Wonders, Madelyn Cline, Sarah Pidgeon, Tyriq Withers, and Jonah Haur-King, with Lola Tung, Nicholas Alexander Chavez, Austin Nichols, and Gabbriette rounding out the ensemble. The I Know What You Did Last Summer sequel will be released in theaters on July 18, 2025. RELATED: ‘I Know What You Did Last Summer’ Reboot Director On New Film Ignoring Sequel: “Definitely Not”",
