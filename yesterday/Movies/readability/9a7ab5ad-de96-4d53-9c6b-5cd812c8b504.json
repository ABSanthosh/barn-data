  "text": "Vertical has acquired North American rights to William Kaufman’s sci-fi thriller “Osiris,” starring Max Martini, Brianna Hildebrand, LaMonica Garrett, Linds Edwards and Linda Hamilton.  Written by Kaufman and Paul Reichelt, “Osiris” follows “a team of Special Forces commandos in the middle of an operation who are abducted by a mysterious spacecraft. When they wake up aboard the ship, they quickly discover they are being hunted by a merciless alien race,” according to a press release. “Working with Max Martini for a second time, Linda Hamilton, Brianna Hildebrand and the legendary creature effects maestro Todd Masters, along with the rest of our exceptional cast and crew, to bring this old-school action sci-fi thriller to life was just incredible,” Kaufman said in a statement.   Popular on Variety “We filmed the movie as practically as possible from the aliens, set builds, and stunts – all to stay true to the movies we love. We are thrilled to partner with Vertical to reach a wide audience that will appreciate our approach.” “Osiris” was produced by Martini, on Wroblewski and Christian Sosa for Roosevelt Film Lab, Andrew and Isaac Lewis for Denton Film. The film is executive produced by Reichelt, David Gendron, and Ali Jazayeri. “Osiris” features cinematography by Mark Rutledge, costumes by Natalie Tippett and a score from John Roome. Paul Alix serves as production designer, with editing by Sara Kaufman.  “William has created a fun and fresh take on the alien thrillers of the eighties and nineties we all love,” added Vertical partner Peter Jarowey. “We’re honored to have the legendary Linda Hamilton be a part of this visually exciting creature feature and know that fans will turn out for this movie.”  The North American rights to “Osiris” were negotiated by SVP of acquisitions Tony Piantedosi and manager of acquisitions \u0026 sales Rachel White on behalf of Vertical, and by Pip Ngo and Nate Bolotin on behalf of XYZ Films. “Osiris” is slated for release later this summer.",
