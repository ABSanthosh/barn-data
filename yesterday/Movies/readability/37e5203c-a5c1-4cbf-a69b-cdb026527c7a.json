  "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Oscar winner Natalie Portman is set to star in rom-com Good Sex, written and to be directed by Golden Globe winner Lena Dunham (Girls). CAA Media Finance represents domestic rights while Film Nation Entertainment is handling international and will introduce the buzzy project at next week’s EFM.  After Babygirl and Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy, age gap romances are in vogue and in Good Sex it’s Portman’s turn to have a dalliance with a younger man. The synopsis reads: “After spending a decade in a failed relationship, successful couples’ therapist Ally (Portman) is turning 40 and is pushed, kicking and screaming, by her best friend back into the hopeless New York dating scene. But Ally finds her life pulled in opposing directions as she falls into a steamy fling with a 20-something Brooklyn hipster just as she begins a promising, more conventional relationship with Alan, a successful 50-something in Manhattan. As a romantic crossroads blossoms into a full-blown identity crisis, Ally juggles to keep these two very different men separate and to make sense of her own conflicting desires before she risks losing them both.”    Watch on Deadline Portman and Sophie Mas will produce through their company, MountainA, along with Dunham and Michael Cohen under their Good Thing Going banner.   Portman has previously spoken of her admiration for Dunham as a filmmaker and how she was inspired by her after seeing Tiny Furniture. Black Swan and May December star Portman has Guy Ritchie’s Fountain Of Youth and Cathy Yan’s The Gallerist in post. Girls creator Dunham is in post on Netflix mini-series Too Much with Will Sharpe and Megan Stalter. Portman is represented by CAA and attorney George Sheanshang; MountainA by CAA and Frankfurt Kurnit. Dunham and Good Thing Going are represented by CAA and Hansen, Jacobson.",
