In his desperation to rekindle the closeness they once shared, Craig makes some questionable decisions that lead to more awkward situations and laughs. On the surface, this is a quirky comedy that relies heavily on Tim Robinson’s performance. However, there is much more to this movie. Throughout, it addresses many common insecurities that men face in their lives. Yet, it avoids approaching them in the usual, clichéd ways. Instead, it views them from a different perspective, and it does so without criticism and judgment. I find it refreshing to watch a story of a man facing his insecurities, and for that portrayal to not feel particularly condescending. At a time when the notion of toxic masculinity tends to maneuver its way into everything, Friendship avoids it, choosing to allow the lead men to be vulnerable and human.  Casting director Melissa DeLizia brings to the table the perfect people to represent the main characters. Paul Rudd, often considered the most likeable guy in Hollywood, oozes charm and appeal, making him the ideal neighbor with whom any middle-aged man would want to befriend. Yet, it’s Tim Robinson’s embodiment of Craig that carries Friendship. I could not imagine anyone navigating the line between awkward and normal the way he does. At times, I find humor in just his expressions.  In addition to the leads, supporting cast members Kate Mara and Jack Dylan Grazer, who play Craig’s wife and son, respectively, win me over. While she represents a trope in a lot of ways, her relationship with her son side-steps what I would have expected, and I find that hilarious.  Overall, Friendship is a nice departure from the typical male-bonding, bromance type films. It’s fresh and hilarious, and we could use more of this kind of approach to masculinity in movies. If you need a good laugh, it's in theaters now! Check out the Trailer.",
