A foundational pillar of the show’s ubiquity and popularity is in the writing and execution of the show, which stands head and shoulders above its contemporaries. I was honored to speak with senior writer Daniel Radosh and editor Lauren Beckett Jackson recently to discuss the show, the tug-of-war between comedy and information, accusations of left-leaning bias, and the care and attention that make the magic happen. The hard work of these dedicated professionals assures that “The Daily Show” will continue to remain relevant in the spheres of both comedy and journalism for years to come, and I firmly believe we’re all the better for it. The news cycle is bewildering, sobering, and unfortunately constant, creating a need for levity to ease digestion. I’m no doctor, but I suggest you take a dose of “The Daily Show” and call me in the morning. You just might feel better. Until next time, take care.-McEric, aka Eric McClanahan-",
