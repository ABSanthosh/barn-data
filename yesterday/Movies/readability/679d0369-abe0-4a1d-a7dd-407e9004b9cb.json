  "description": "\"People like us billow up around Ratel... like clouds.\" ðŸŒ© Blue Finch Films has unveiled an official UK trailer for Cloud, the unconventional Japanese thriller made by acclaimed filmmaker Kiyoshi Kurosawa (also of XX). We posted two original Japanese trailers for this last year during its premiere at the 2024 Venice Film Festival (one of my favorites of the fest). It's now set for an April 2025 release in UK cinemas, but still has no US release date confirmed yet. The title Cloud is a reference to the digital space known as the cloud, as it's a peculiar horror story about how hatred spreads online. Yoshii, a young man who resells goods online by flipping cheap products for high prices, finds himself at the center of a series of mysterious events that put his life at risk. Online threats against him start to become real. The film stars Masaki Suda, Kotone Furukawa, Daikan Okudaira, Okayama Amane, Yoshiyoshi Arakawa, \u0026 Masataka Kubota. The film is less of a horror, more of an action thriller, with some mysterious elements that build up as it goes on. Hopefully more and more people will catch up with this once it's released this year - [â€¦]",

Here's the official UK trailer (+ quad poster) for Kiyoshi Kurosawa's thriller Cloud, direct from YouTube: You can rewatch the teaser trailer for Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Cloud right here and the full Japanese trailer. A suspense thriller depicting \"collective madness\" born from a chain of hatred. A man wearing a bag mask suddenly appears in front of the main character, Yoshii. Yoshii suddenly becomes a \"target\" when he hears a voice saying \"I'll kill this guy\" while looking at an online screen where hatred towards \"Ratel\" is posted. Why are you being targeted? Who are you targeting? Cloud, also known as ã‚¯ãƒ©ã‚¦ãƒ‰ in Japanese, is written and directed by prolific Japanese filmmaker Kiyoshi Kurosawa, director of many films including Sweet Home, Cure, License to Live, Charisma, Pulse, Bright Future, Doppelganger, Retribution, Tokyo Sonata, Real, Seventh Code, Journey to the Shore, Creepy, Daguerrotype, Before We Vanish, To the Ends of the Earth, and Wife of a Spy previously. Produced by Tokyo Theater Nikkatsu. The film premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival in the Out of Competition section last year, and it also played at TIFF and Beyond Fest. Kurosawa's Cloud already opened in Japan last September. Still no US release is confirmed yet. Blue Finch Films will release Cloud in UK cinemas starting April 25th, 2025 this spring.
