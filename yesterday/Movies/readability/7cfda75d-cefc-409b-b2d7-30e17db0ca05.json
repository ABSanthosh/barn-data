  "text": "After taking on the dramatic role of an aging Las Vegas dancer in Gia Coppola‘s “The Last Showgirl,” Pamela Anderson was ready for a change of pace. For her next project, she decided to lean into her sillier side, co-starring opposite Liam Neeson in Paramount’s reboot of the 1980s and ’90s cop comedy franchise “The Naked Gun.” Directed by Lonely Island’s Akiva Schaffer and produced by Seth MacFarlane, the project was another dream role for Anderson, who’s riding high after receiving nominations from the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards for her performance in “The Last Showgirl.” “It was so fun. I mean, it’s so different than this film. It’s a high comedy. I’m literally running into walls, which I’ve always wanted to do,” said Anderson in a recent interview on “Late Night with Seth Meyers.” “And Liam is such a gentleman. He’s such a sweetheart, such a love, and we just had a great connection. And Akiva is a wonderful director. But what a difference, going from an indie film to a Paramount ‘Naked Gun.'” Popular on IndieWire Anderson was overwhelmed by all the trappings of studio filmmaking, from having a video village for the director and crew to receiving multiple takes to try out alternate jokes. This is a popular practice on sitcoms and variety shows like “Saturday Night Live” — used to get the biggest laughs — and one that kept Anderson on her toes throughout the shoot. “All this ‘Saturday Night Live’ crew, [Akiva’s] buddies, were there just throwing out jokes,” she said. “Some were funny, some weren’t, but some were — most of them were funny. Liam is hysterical. You’re not going to see it coming. That’s how good he is.” Meyers, being a friend and former colleague of Schaffer’s, has already seen some clips of the film and was very impressed with how good Anderson was at “playing it straight.” “It’s so hard. So hard. It was really hard to keep a straight face,” Anderson told Meyers. “But, yeah, you can’t ruin it. And like I said, complete departure. And I was also afraid to meet Liam, but Liam is also just a wonderful, generous person. And what an honor.” Watch a clip from Anderson’s interview on “Late Night” below. “The Last Showgirl” is currently in theaters from Roadside Attractions.",
