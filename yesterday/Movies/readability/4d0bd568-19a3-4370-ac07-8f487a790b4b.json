Martin is teasing a project with Game of Thrones star Maisie Williams. The author of A Song of Ice and Fire, the fantasy novel that inspired the HBO drama series created by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, hinted he was working with Williams on something. “We also got together with Maisie Williams for pizza and pasta, and talked about… well, no, better not get into that, do not want to jinx it,” Martin wrote in his blog as he recounted his travels in London. “But it could be so much fun.” Martin didn’t specify what the project with Williams was about or whether it involved a Game of Thrones sequel. Williams played Arya Stark throughout the show’s eight-season run on HBO. Watch on Deadline HBO head Casey Bloys recently commented on how it to work with Martin on the multiple projects set in the Game of Thrones universe. “He’s very important to me, to us,” Bloys told reporters on Tuesday, November 12. “But when we put shows together, it’s like putting a marriage together. Marriages can be difficult, especially when Ryan Condal is making creative decisions and adapting work. It can be fraught. Any marriage can get rocky. I would prefer everybody get along, of course. But with the creative process, we are always going to have bumps. That’s to be expected.” RELATED: ‘Game Of Thrones’ Creator George R.R.
