Who is Peter Dinklage married to? Peter Dinklage is married to Erica Schmidt. While the couple mostly prefers to keep the details of their personal lives private, they often gush about each other in interviews.

Peter Dinklage and Erica Schmidt’s relationship history Peter Dinklage met his wife around 2003 in New York City. In a 2021 interview with The New York Times, he recalled how they met at a mutual friend’s house. “It was about 18 years ago now. We were all at a friend’s house, and someone said, ‘They’re walking the elephants through the Queens-Midtown Tunnel.’ The circus was in town, and it was snowing, and they were walking the elephants through Manhattan, a long line of them. It was like something out of a beautiful, fantastical, end-of-the-world, crazy, romantic movie,” Dinklage reminisced. After about two years of dating, the couple eloped in Las Vegas in 2005. Dinklage was flying there for a charity event, and they decided to get married while in the city. The two have been inseparable ever since, making countless public appearances together. Dinklage and Schmidt welcomed their daughter in 2011, followed by a second child in 2017. As of writing, the couple has not disclosed the names of their children or the gender of their youngest child.",
