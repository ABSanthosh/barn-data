During filming in 2021, Baldwin's gun discharged and struck Hutchins and Souza, killing Hutchins. A few years later filming resumed and the finished film premiered at the Camerimage Film Festival last year (the fest focuses on cinematography so it was a premiere in honor of Hutchins). This whole tragic incident still bothers \u0026 saddens me so I must say I have no interest in ever watching this. It should've been canned. Here's the first teaser trailer (+ poster) for Joel Souza's western film Rust, direct from YouTube: In Kansas in the 1880s, recently orphaned Lucas McCalister (Patrick Scott McDermott) accidentally kills a rancher and is sentenced to hang. In a twist of fate, his estranged grandfather, notorious outlaw Harland Rust (Oscar nominee Alec Baldwin), breaks him out of jail and takes him on the run toward Mexico. As they flee across the unforgiving wilderness, the fugitive pair must outrun the determined U.S. Marshal Wood Helm (Josh Hopkins) \u0026 a ruthless bounty hunter called \"Preacher\" (Travis Fimmel). Rust is written and directed by filmmaker Joel Souza, director of the films Hanna's Gold, Ghost Squad, Break Night, and Crown Vic previously. From a story written by Joel Souza and Alec Baldwin. Produced by Alec Baldwin, Matt DelPiano, Grant Hill, Nathan Klingher, Anjul Nigam, Ryan Donnell Smith, \u0026 Ryan Winterstern. After cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed while filming, the film was finished with Bianca Cline as DP. This initially premiered at the 2024 Camerimage Film Festival in Poland last year. Falling Forward Films will debut Souza's Rust in select US theaters + on VOD starting on May 2nd, 2025 coming soon. Anyone? Find more posts in: To Watch, Trailer prev next",
