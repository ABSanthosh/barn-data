Breakup Season is the feature directorial debut of friend-of-the-site \u0026 filmmaker H. Nelson Tracey after many short films.

A young man brings his new girlfriend to his rural Oregon hometown for Christmas to introduce her to his family, only for things to go terribly wrong upon arrival – they decide to break up. But she can't leave, so they're stuck together for the holidays. \"Funny, dramatic, and bittersweet in equal measure. Breakup Season is an authentic look at early 20s love \u0026 heartbreak. Subverting traditional holiday conventions with a more grounded and relatable approach than typical [cheesy] holiday fare, the film explores the topics of family and breakups with sincerity.\" The film stars Chandler Riggs, Samantha Isler, James Urbaniak, Brook Hogan, Carly Stewart, \u0026 Jacob Wysocki.

Gotta say this looks really sweet and funny and authentic - giving me that warm \u0026 fuzzy feeling as only the holidays can. Check it out. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for H. Nelson Tracey's film Breakup Season, direct from YouTube: Unemployed yet ambitious 24-year-old Ben Russell (Chandler Riggs) brings his girlfriend named Cassie ( Samantha Isler ) to his rural Oregon hometown to meet his family and celebrate Christmas. The arrival is bumpy. The family’s dynamic unearths internal conflict Cassie is having with Ben. The night they arrive, a late night argument turns into a breakup. Cassie determines she should go home for Christmas after all... But because of the remote location, a raging snowstorm, and busy holiday travel, there is no way for her to leave. Cassie is now stuck with her newly minted ex and his entire family until the end of Christmas. Breakup Season is written and directed by the American indie filmmaker H. Nelson Tracey, making his feature directorial debut after many other short films previously (he also made this live-action Geri's Game remake). It's produced by Stephen Mastrocola, Rafi Jacobs, Liana Montemayor, Christopher Jennings, H. Nelson Tracey. This initially premiered at the 2024 Desertscape Film Festival earlier this year.
