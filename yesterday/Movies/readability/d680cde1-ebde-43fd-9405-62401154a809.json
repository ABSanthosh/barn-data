  "description": "\"You will never lose me. Not as long as you stay who you are.\" The Academy has revealed their 2025 Best Picture Nominee video just before the Oscar ceremony this weekend. This fantastic 2-min montage brings together all 10 of the nominees – from Anora to Wicked to The Brutalist to Conclave to The Substance – to reminds us why we love movies so much. And also to highlight each of the nominees and what makes them so powerful \u0026 unforgettable. The Academy has been putting out these final montages for the past few years: here's for 2023 and also for 2024 last year. This Oscars video was edited by a friend of the site, best known as \"Sleepy Skunk\", who has been creating movie trailer mashups and retrospectives for years (view them all there). The ending with the Wicked scene makes sense, because most people will recognize this film, but I'm still just happy to see Nickel Boys, The Brutalist, and Anora nominated for Best Picture anyway. Enjoy. Thanks to The Academy for posting this showcase video on their YouTube for everyone to enjoy (in full 4K!). Keep on making nice montages like this. The Best Picture nominees: Anora […]",

The Best Picture nominees: Anora (directed by Sean Baker), The Brutalist (directed by Brady Corbet), A Complete Unknown (directed by James Mangold), Conclave (directed by Edward Berger), Dune: Part Two (directed by Denis Villeneuve), Emilia Pérez (directed by Jacques Audiard), I'm Still Here (directed by Walter Salles), Nickel Boys (directed by RaMell Ross), The Substance (directed by Coralie Fargeat), and Wicked (directed by Jon M. Chu). The complete list of nominees for all categories is here. This magnificent cinema montage will also be played at the ceremony; not sure if it will make it on TV during the live stream (since it played during commercials in the years past). Another terrific selection of Best Picture movies from 2024 to celebrate. Which of these are you rooting for? Find more posts in: Awards, Feat, To Watch prev next",
