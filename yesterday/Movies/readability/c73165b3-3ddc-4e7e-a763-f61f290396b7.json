  "text": "Zach Cregger is teasing his new vision for Resident Evil and why he wanted to reboot the franchise. The film adaptation of the Capcom videogame is set to star Austin Abrams, and in a new interview, Cregger revealed why he wanted to tell this story. “Because I love the games,” Cregger told ComicBook. “I played all of the games. I played Resident Evil 4 a hundred times through. I’m obsessed with it. And so, I just want to tell a story that feels like it’s honoring the experience you get when you play the games.” He continued, “I haven’t seen the movies, that’s just not my thing. But the games are my thing. That’s just a playground I just love….I think the movie is going to rip. I think it’s going to rip.” Watch on Deadline Earlier this year, Cregger attended CinemaCon, where he also provided insight into the Resident Evil film he was working on. “There’s a moment that comes in every moment of every Resident Evil game where you find yourself standing in the mouth of a dark passageway. One shot in the gun is left,” he said. “You know that something horrible is waiting for you in that darkness, that awful moment where you have to will yourself. That’s something that every Resident Evil game has perfected and has kept me and millions of other players returning to the series for decades.” Cregger added that his film “will be built in the spirit of those games and follows one central protagonist from point A to point B, as they descend deeper into hell.” Resident Evil is expected to be released on September 18, 2026.",
