Roger Ebert originally gave it a mixed review back in the day at only 2-1/2 stars, though he did praise it saying: \"It is a well-directed film, because Besson has a natural gift for plunging into drama with a charged-up visual style.

And it is well acted.\" Yes the whole cast in this is superb - I always get a kick out of Oldman. Here's the new 4K re-release trailer (+ posters) for Luc Besson's LÃ©on: The Professional, from YouTube: \"If you want the job done right, hire a professional.\" ðŸª´ After her father, step-mother, step-sister and little brother are killed by her father's employers, the 12-year-old daughter (Natalie Portman) of an abject drug dealer manages to take refuge in the apartment of a professional hitman who at her request teaches her the methods of his job so she can take her revenge on the corrupt DEA agent who ruined her life by killing her beloved brother. LÃ©on: The Professional, also known as just LÃ©on in France or The Professional in the US, is both written and directed by acclaimed French filmmaker Luc Besson, his fifth feature film at the time after making La Femme Nikita (1990) before followed by The Fifth Element (1997) after. Produced by Patrice Ledoux. The film originally opened in November 1994 in theaters in France and America, earning a few Cesar Award nominations. Madman will re-release The Professional in Australia - in celebration of the film's 30th anniversary, this Blu-Ray has been created from newly restored masters. One of your favorites?
