  "text": "Invincible recently returned with its third season, continuing the story of Mark Grayson, aka Invincible, as he faces both his past and future while protecting his loved ones. Amidst the engaging storyline, one particular aspect of the show has piqued viewers’ interest—the heights of Invincible, his father Omni-Man, and Immortal. So, how tall is Invincible compared to Immortal and Omni-Man? Here’s everything you need to know about the heights of these iconic characters in the animated superhero series. How tall are Invincible, Immortal, and Omni Man? Mark Grayson, aka Invincible, is said to be around 5’11” to 6’0″. According to Death Battle Fanon Wiki, his height was originally listed as 5’11”, but he eventually grew an inch taller, as he started out as a teenage superhero. In terms of abilities, he possesses superhuman strength as a Viltrumite hybrid. He can bench press 400 tons and lift cruise ships weighing over 100,000 tons. Additionally, he can fly at lightning speed, has high durability and endurance, and possesses numerous other powers. Meanwhile, Invincible’s father, Omni-Man, is officially listed as 6’2″ in his character handbook. This makes him only slightly taller than his son. As a Viltrumite, Omni-Man has advanced genetics that grant him reverse aging. His aging slows down as he grows older. He enjoys stable health, superior strength, and resilience, allowing him to withstand brutal attacks without feeling pain. Additionally, he has advanced healing abilities, flight, superhuman senses, and immense speed. Lastly, Immortal is 6 feet tall, making him almost the same height as Invincible. A supporting character in the series, Immortal was a member of the original Guardians of the Globe and later became their leader after Robot stepped down. His abilities include immortality, regeneration, and resurrection, as well as strength and durability comparable to a Viltrumite. Invincible features voice work from Steven Yeun, Sandra Oh, J.K. Simmons, and many others. The series is currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video.",
