Every shot in this is absolutely jaw-dropping. This short film originally debuted back in 2017, but was recently reposted by National Geographic on their channel and it's a breathtaking must watch. Directed and shot by cinematographer Macgregor, the 13-min film is titled The Mauritania Railway - Backbone of the Sahara. \"One of the longest and heaviest trains in the world, the 1.8-mile beast runs from the mining center of Zouerat to port city of Nouadhibou on Africa’s Atlantic coast. The train is the bedrock of the Mauritanian economy and a lifeline to the outside world for the people who live along its route.\" The best \"holy shit\" shot is at 6:08. This video also adds an especially fascinating context to the outstanding film Sirat, which premiered to rave reviews at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival this year (here's mine). Once you've seen the film you'll understand how it all connects. View below. Thanks to National Geographic for reposting this.
