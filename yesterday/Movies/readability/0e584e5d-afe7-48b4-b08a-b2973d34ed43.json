New posters showcase dragons and characters, hinting at exciting visuals. Flying scenes are crucial; success hinges on their execution in live-action. Expect a new trailer soon, with the film set for release on June 13, 2025. The new live-action remake of¬†How¬†to Train Your Dragon will premiere at CinemaCon next week, so maybe the early social media reactions will be dropping soon. The wide release is also creeping up on us, and it seems that Universal has decided to show off what the other dragons look like in the form of character posters. Now, we have some clearer images of not only the other characters but also their respective dragons. I think they look about as good as you can expect, but still images aren't seeing them in motion and that will be the thing that makes or breaks this film. Those flying scenes are so essential, and if they don't nail those scenes, there is a good chance this entire movie is going to fall apart. A bunch of character posters usually means another trailer is right around the corner, so maybe a new trailer drops sometime this week, right before the premiere. How to Train Your Dragon:¬†Summary, Cast List, Release Date From three-time Oscar¬Æ nominee and Golden Globe winner Dean DeBlois, the creative visionary behind DreamWorks Animation's acclaimed How to Train Your Dragon trilogy comes a stunning live-action reimagining of the film that launched the beloved franchise. On the rugged isle of Berk, where Vikings and dragons have been bitter enemies for generations, Hiccup (Mason Thames; The Black Phone, For All Mankind) stands apart. The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. With the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village's quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. As an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup's friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader. The film also stars Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2), Gabriel Howell (Bodies), Bronwyn James (Wicked), Harry Trevaldwyn (Smothered), Ruth Codd (The Midnight Club), BAFTA nominee Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Murray McArthur (Game of Thrones). How to Train Your Dragon is written, produced and directed by DeBlois. It is also produced by three-time Oscar¬Æ nominee Marc Platt (Wicked, La La Land) and Emmy winner Adam Siegel (Drive, 2 Guns). How To Train Your Dragon is part of the Filmed For IMAX¬Æ Program, which offers filmmakers IMAX¬Æ technology to help them deliver the most immersive movie experience to audiences around the world. Inspired by Cressida Cowell's New York Times bestselling book series, DreamWorks Animation's How to Train Your Dragon franchise has captivated global audiences, earning four Academy Award¬Æ nominations and grossing more than $1.6 billion at the global box office. Now, through cutting-edge visual effects, DeBlois transforms his beloved animated saga into a breathtaking live-action spectacle, bringing the epic adventures of Hiccup and Toothless to life with jaw-dropping realism as they discover the true meaning of friendship, courage and destiny. How To Train Your Dragon will be released in theaters on June 13, 2025. Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!
