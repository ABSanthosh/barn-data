  "text": "CBS has canceled the reboot of “The Equalizer” after five seasons, Variety has learned. The series, which is led by Queen Latifah, was the last remaining bubble show at the broadcast network. The season finale airing on May 4 will now serve as the series finale. Previously, CBS had canceled the freshman multi-cam “Poppa’s House” as well as both “FBI: International” and “FBI: Most Wanted.” CBS had also aired a backdoor pilot for a potential “Equalizer” spinoff earlier this season, which is also not moving forward. The move to cancel “The Equalizer” is not altogether surprising, as the show was also on the bubble last season. It is co-produced by CBS Studios and outside studio Universal Television, making it a less attractive option for CBS financially, particularly this late in its run. The network has also already picked up a number of new drama shows for next season, including a new entry in the “FBI” franchise starring Tom Ellis (another UTV co-production) and the comedy pilot “DMV” to series. CBS has also already ordered the “Fire Country” spinoff “Sheriff Country,” as well as the “Blue Bloods” spinoff “Boston Blue.” Popular on Variety The Matthew Gray Gubler drama “Einstein” was also picked up for next season, but CBS pushed the show to the 2026-2027 season earlier this week. CBS previously announced a large number of renewals, including a two-season pickup for comedy “Ghosts” as well as ordering more seasons of shows like “Tracker” and “NCIS.” “The Equalizer” was a reimagining of the 1980s series, with Queen Latifah starring as Robyn McCall, a former CIA operative who helped people with nowhere else to turn. The cast also includes Tory Kittles, Adam Goldberg, Liza Lapira, Laya DeLeon Hayes, and Lorraine Toussaint. The series was devleoped for television by Andrew Marlowe and Terri Miller, as based on the original series co-created by Richard Lindheim. Joseph C. Wilson, Queen Latifah) Debra Martin Chase, Shakim Compere, John Davis, John Fox, Loretha Jones, and Rob Hanning served as executive producers.",
