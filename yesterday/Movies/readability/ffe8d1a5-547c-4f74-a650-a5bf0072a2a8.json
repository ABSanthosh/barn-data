On March 3, Malawi Wildlife Rescue Season 2 drops on Disney Plus. The documentary series showcases the events at Malawi’s only wildlife sanctuary.

Further, Marvel Television’s Daredevil: Born Again premieres on the streaming platform this week. The series focuses on a blind lawyer named Matt Murdock, who embarks on a journey for justice.

Later, the animated series Morphle: Shorts will be available on Disney Plus. It focuses on Mila and her pet, who has the ability to transform her dreams into reality. Thus, the duo engages in a series of adventures, showcasing the importance of friendship. Also coming out on Disney Plus is Primos on March 5. The animated series focuses on a 10-year-old girl, Tater, who carries an “it factor” that sets her apart from others.
