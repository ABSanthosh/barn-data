No spoilers are present in the featurette, making it a safe watch for fans eager to stay in the dark before release. It's time for some behind-the-scenes fun for¬†The Fantastic Four: First Steps. The Fantastic Four have been Marvel's First Family for decades now, but when Marvel Studios started bringing their characters to the big screen, they were unable to use some of their biggest and most well-known characters because other studios had the rights. However, things have changed, and now the Fantastic Four are at Marvel Studios and joining the MCU officially later this month. Marvel has been hyping this one up a lot for a bunch of different reasons, and we see some more of that hype and how the movie came to be in a new behind-the-scenes featurette, which was released today. It doesn't appear to have any spoilers for those trying to stay spoiler-free, and we learn about the practical elements of the production, which is always fun.
