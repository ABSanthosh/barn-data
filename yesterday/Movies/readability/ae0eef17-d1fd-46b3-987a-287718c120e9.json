With less than two months to go until Marvel Television and Disney+'s Charlie Cox (Matt Murdock) and Vincent D'Onofrio (Wilson Fisk/Kingpin)-starring Daredevil: Born Again hits our screens, we were treated to a look at the highly anticipated official trailer earlier today. One of the biggest takeaways? The intense but respectful one-on-one between Matt and Wilson, with the latter looking to make his play for the mayoralship. It's a scene that we're very much looking forward to seeing play out – and it's the kind of scene that we won't be seeing many of this season, according to Cox – and for a very good reason.

It has to feel like it could and will explode. The more you bring us together with no consequence, the less that illusion can maintain itself,\" Cox explained during an interview with EW, making the point that the face-offs matter more when they're rare. \"There's actually an episode later on in the season where, in an original draft, we had a conversation, and I brought this up,\" Cox continued. \"I said, 'I worry that if you tell the story that we can have a conversation and walk away from it at this stage, we lose a lot of stakes.' So they found a really cool way to not have us do that.\" Daredevil: Born Again Overview, Preview \u0026 More! During New York Comic Con (NYCC) in October 2024, Cox and D'Onofrio \"crashed a Marvel panel to screen a look at the series and confirm that it would be hitting Disney+ in March 2025. Speaking with Collider, the duo discussed what viewers could expect in terms of tones and themes, an understandable topic considering the Netflix series set a pretty high bar in terms of down-n-dirty action and intrigue. \"We're continuing the darkness of the first series on Netflix. It is gonna be that dark and that intense. We worked our butts off to make it that way,\" D'Onofrio shared about the upcoming series. \"We do some things that are definitely a first for Disney+.\" In fact, Cox confirmed that his Matt Murdoch was going to get a chance at having a \"potty mouth\" – at least once. \"I got an F-bomb in there for the first time ever… It was shocking to me,\" Cox shared – and he might be right if you look at it in terms of series produced by Marvel Studios/Television and not the Netflix shows that were brought over into the MCU timeline. In terms of where things stand with Matt, Foggy (Elden Henson), and Karen (Deborah Ann Woll) – now running Nelson, Murdock \u0026 Page – Cox noted, \"A few years have passed. In that time, Matt, Foggy, and Karen have found a pretty good rhythm.\" In fact, Matt's even found a way to strike a balance between practicing the law and kicking ass as a vigilante – until a certain someone re-enters his life. \"Matt's made peace with his role both as a lawyer and a vigilante,\" shared Cox. \"Then, of course, shit hits the fan.\" In Marvel Television's Daredevil: Born Again, Matt Murdock (Cox), a blind lawyer with heightened abilities, is fighting for justice through his bustling law firm, while former mob boss Wilson Fisk (D'Onofrio) pursues his own political endeavors in New York. When their past identities begin to emerge, both men find themselves on an inevitable collision course. With Dario Scardapane serving as showrunner, the series stars Charlie Cox, Vincent D'Onofrio, Margarita Levieva, Deborah Ann Woll, Elden Henson, Zabryna Guevara, Nikki James, Genneya Walton, Arty Froushan, Clark Johnson, and Michael Gandolfini, along with Ayelet Zurer and Jon Bernthal.
