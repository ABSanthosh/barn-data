  "description": "\"I want each and every one of them torn to shreds!\" Not if they take you out first. Netflix has revealed an official trailer for an intense action thriller movie called Counterstrike, made by the Mexican filmmaker Chava Cartas. This is set for a streaming debut on Netflix starting at the end of this month. When a hostage rescue mission creates a new enemy, Capt. Guerrero and his elite soldiers must face an ambush by a ruthless drug cartel. While there have been a few other movies titled Counterstrike before (like this one), this new movie reminds me of the popular video game Counter-Strike made by Valve. With a similar concept about a group of five elite soldiers (basically a group of players hanging out \u0026 working together on the same team?) outsmarting the dangerous cartel and taking out the bad guys. Starring Luis Alberti, Noé Hernández, Mayra Batalla, Leonardo Alonso, Pedro Joaquín, Guillermo Nava, and David Calderón León. This definitely is worth a look for anyone who's into action movies - might actually be an entertaining watch. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Chava Cartas' action film Counterstrike, direct from YouTube: On a shopping trip to the US […]",
