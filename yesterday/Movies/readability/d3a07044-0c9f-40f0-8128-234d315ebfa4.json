  "text": "After years of wrangling, the Los Angeles City Council tomorrow will consider final approval for a proposed $1 billion expansion of Television City. Before doing so, members will hear from nine groups that filed appeals against the project over concerns it would harm the surrounding community. Rick Caruso and The Grove, and the A.F. Gilmore Company and Original Farmers Market L.A. were among those filing appeals against the project. Other groups opposed to the project included the Mayer Beverly Park Limited Partnership, Save Beverly Fairfax, Beverly Wilshire Homes Association, Fix the City, Neighbors for Responsible TVC Development, Miracle Mile Residents Association and Park La Brea Impacted Residents Group. They said the proposed expansion would lead to more pollution, noise and traffic. The council’s Planning and Land Use Management Committee in December finally recommended approval of the project and denied appeals. The full council is slated to give its final decision on whether the development should move forward. The world’s first purpose-built television studio was constructed in 1952 and has expanded in a patchwork over the years. Hackman Capital acquired the iconic 25-acre property from CBS for $750 million in 2019, though CBS continues to operate at the site as a tenant. The Television City Project would add facilities to the storied lot at Beverly Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue, as well as landscaping improvements and infrastructure enhancements to nearby streets. It would permit up to 1,421,623 square feet of new development, the retention of 264,377 square feet of existing uses and the demolition of up to 479,303 square feet of space for new buildings, according to City Planning documents. The number of stages at Television City would increase from eight to 15. Two stages built in the 1990s would be demolished, but four original stages built by CBS in 1952 would be preserved, along with other historical design elements.
