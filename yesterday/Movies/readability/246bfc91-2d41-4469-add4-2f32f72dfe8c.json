This was filmed on gigantic sets in the UK, and a few pick-up shots in Colombia and Peru. There's some making of glimpses in this video showing all the huge sets and tons of extras needed to make it all look extra vivid \u0026 authentic. Here's the behind-the-scenes promo video for Dougal Wilson's Paddington in Peru, from YouTube: You can rewatch the main UK trailer for Wilson's Paddington in Peru right here, and the US trailer here. Paddington in Peru brings Paddington's story to Peru as he returns to visit his beloved Aunt Lucy, who now resides at the Home for Retired Bears. With the Brown Family in tow, a thrilling adventure ensues when a mystery plunges them into an unexpected journey through the Amazon rainforest and up to the mountain peaks of Peru. Paddington in Peru is directed by English filmmaker Dougal Wilson, making his feature directorial debut after many music videos, short films, and commericals previously. The screenplay is written by Mark Burton, Jon Foster, James Lamont; from a story by Mark Burton, Simon Farnaby, Paul King. Based on characters by Michael Bond. Produced by Rosie Alison and David Heyman. Studiocanal will debut Paddington in Peru in UK cinemas first starting on November 8th, 2024 this fall. Sony will then release the sequel in US theaters on January 17th, 2025 early in the New Year. Does that look super fun? Find more posts: Featurette, Hype, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
