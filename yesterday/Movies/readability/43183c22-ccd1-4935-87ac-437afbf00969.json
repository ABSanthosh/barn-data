Apple TV has revealed the official trailer for Season 2 of their hit comedy series titled Platonic, following two platonic friends getting into all kinds of trouble. The original season of Platonic launched in 2023 (here's the trailer) and it was a great showcase for the comedy antics of Rogen \u0026 Byrne, continuing from the Neighbors movies. Co-created, directed and co-written by Nick Stoller and Francesca Delbanco, Platonic picks up with everyone's favorite pair of best friends (starring Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne as Will and Sylvia) as they contend with new midlife hurdles, including work, weddings \u0026 partners in crises. The duo tries their best to be each other's rock â€” but sometimes rocks break things. ðŸ˜‚ The cast for Season 2 also includes Luke Macfarlane (from Stoller's Bros) and Carla Gallo, and introduces Aidy Bryant, Kyle Mooney, Beck Bennett, and Milo Manheim as guest stars. It looks like a big helping of more shenanigans from these two goofs. Enjoy. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Apple TV+'s series Platonic - Season 2, direct from YouTube: Co-created, directed and co-written by Nick Stoller and Francesca Delbanco, [â€¦]",
