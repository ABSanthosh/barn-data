It’s also awesome, depending on the title, the label, and the release, so each week we take a look at the new Blu-rays and DVDs making their way into the world. Welcome to this week in Home Video for October 22nd, 2024! This week’s home video selection includes Fluke, Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine, In a Violent Nature, and more. Check out our picks below. Fluke [KL Studio Classics] What is it? An underseen classic. Why see it? James Herbert’s novels don’t seem like a likely source of family entertainment, and his original novel isn’t quite the warm and fuzzy feel good time that the movie aims for, but here we are. A man dies and is reincarnated into a newborn puppy. His adventure begins, and it kicks into higher gear when he remembers his past life, his family, and the fact that he was… murdered! Matthew Modine is the lead, Samuel L. Jackson voices his doggy buddy, and we also get Nancy Travis, Eric Stoltz, and more familiar faces/voices. The film features a fantastic sequence involving animals in a testing lab who break free, and it even finds a combination of suspense and emotion during the third act. [Extras: Commentary, interview] The Best The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari [4K UHD] What is it? A silent horror masterpiece. Why see it? At its core, this 1920 feature is a terror tale about a mad doctor and his simp who roam the night committing murders. The reason this film has stood the test of time over the last century, though, is that director Robert Wiene and his crew created something nightmarish through the use of shadows, lighting, angles, and production design. It’s a silent film, but it’s a haunting one, a film that squeezes horror from the darkness in numerous ways, and its visuals will have you wondering what’s wrong with so many of today’s horror makers. This new 4K release does those shadows justice with stark contrast, deep blacks, and details ensuring this old film feels almost new again. [Extras: New and old orchestral scores, documentary, commentary] Creature with the Blue Hand What is it? Twin brothers sit at the heart of a murder spree. Why see it? Film Masters may not be a high profile label, but they’re worth your attention as evidenced by their latest release. This 1967 thriller sees Klaus Kinski in dual roles as twins who are part of a family with its fair share of dark secrets. When one escapes from the asylum, murders begin anew as the body count rises and truths come to light. Attractive production design, bold colors, and a jazzy score keep things moving alongside a compelling story line and mystery. This release also includes two additional movies, both worth the time of genre fans, along with a hefty collection of extras offering details into the production and history of Edgar Wallace features. A great release. [Extras: Additional films Web of the Spider and The Bloody Dead, commentaries, documentaries, booklet] Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine What is it? A blockbuster team-up! Why see it? While many in my field seemed to knock this entry, with some even calling it the death of cinema, I’m sitting comfortably on the side that simply has a lot of fun with what it’s throwing down. Ryan Reynolds may be a one-trick pony these days on the acting front, but that one trick is perfect for this character. Add in Hugh Jackman as the straight man, tons of throwaway gags and references, plenty of fun and bloody action, and an effectively affectionate send off for Marvel’s 20th Century Fox days, and you have a big, loud comedy that delivers. Sure, there’s little to no lasting resonance I guess, but a movie can be about the length of its running time, and on that count, the film is a funny, thrilling watch for fans of the franchise. [Extras: Gag reel, deleted scenes, commentary, featurettes] In a Violent Nature What is it? An undead killer is reawakened. Why see it? Chris Nash’s feature takes an interesting approach to the slasher by presenting it (mostly) from the killer’s journey — we follow him around as he lumbers slowly through the woods and towards his victims. As closely aligned with something like Gus Van Sant’s Elephant as it is a slasher, we stick with the killer as snippets of conversations are overheard, backstory presented in whispers and brief exchanges, and it’s an unusual approach for the material. Nash muddles the concept some in the third act, but it’s all forgiven as the kills come to life with some wonderfully gnarly practical effects including one that still stands as the kill of the year. This collector’s Blu-ray release is packed with extras detailing every aspect of the production. [Extras: Featurettes, commentaries] Thunderbolt and Lightfoot [KL Studio Classics] What is it? Two guys become friends and robbers. Why see it? Before Michael Cimino moved onto bigger, more “important” pieces of cinema, he made his debut with this wonderful character piece that also happens to feature some action. Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges star as two men who become friends and soon decide to rob a depository. It involves pulling some unsavory characters into the fold meaning bad news is on the horizon, but getting there is half the fun as Eastwood and Bridges showcase a relaxed and breezy relationship. Those early hang-out scenes are arguably the highlight, but they work to bolster the emotional stakes of what’s to come. [Extras: New 4K scan, commentary, featurette] Veep: The Complete Series What is it? One of the funniest shows ever made. Why see it? Before I go further, no, you don’t need to double dip here if you already own previous releases of the show, whether individual season releases or the complete series, as this new Blu-ray set doesn’t add anything new content-wise. If you don’t own it already, though, this is one of the all-time great comedy shows with more laughs per episode than most sitcoms manage per season. Pitch-perfect casting and writing results in performances that burst from the screen with biting, hilarious comments and exchanges, and not for nothing, but its exaggerated take on American politics came precariously close to reality during the Trump years. Scary stuff. [Extras: Commentaries, deleted scenes, featurettes, outtakes] The Rest The Beast Within What is it? A girl discovers her parents’ hairy secret. Why see it? Sometimes a film is ultimately only worth it for fans of a particular talent involved, and that sometime is now. Werewolf films are my jam, and there’s no one way to present them, but certain ingredients are important including the lore, the creature, and the set-pieces we get along the way. This film can’t quite deliver on any of those counts as it instead doles out a slowburn tale that fails to make the journey worthwhile. So yes, it’s for Kit Harington fans only. [Extras: None] Borderlands [4K UHD] What is it? A movie based on a videogame. Why see it? I haven’t played the videogame in question, so I can’t speak to its value as an adaptation, but as a movie? It’s a meh. The film blends action, sci-fi, and comedy, and while those ingredients have resulted in magic before, here they only clash and fumble. The laughs struggle across the board, but some fun action/sci-fi beats squeak through on occasion when they’re not being muffled by dull CG or staging. Game fans should give it a spin, I guess, but there’s a whole universe of options out there for film lovers just looking for a good time. [Extras: Featurettes] Plenty [KL Studio Classics] What is it? A woman is bored, very, very bored. Why see it? Meryl Streep headlines, and is the reason to watch, this mid 80s drama set in post-WWII England. She’s a woman who misses the excitement and uncertainty of war, and this new calm just isn’t cutting it. The result is something unusual in cinema — and mostly unheard of in today’s Hollywood — in that she’s an unlikable lead character by design. That arguably makes her more interesting, and while the rest of the film can’t match her fascination, Streep and her character make a watch more than worthwhile. [Extras: Interview, commentary] Twisters What is it? It’s not a sequel. Why see it? The smart money would have been to tie this in somehow to the beloved Bill Paxton/Helen Hunt blockbuster, especially as it copies many of the same plot points, but whatever. Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones are good together, and the tornado action is thrilling enough as the storms lay waste to a small town. It oddly feels less fun than the original, partly because today’s news cycles have shown us more real-world devastation maybe, but it still entertains and builds to an engaging final set-piece. [Extras: Deleted scenes, gag reel, featurettes] Up the Creek [KL Studio Classics] What is it? A raunchy comedy about water sports. Why see it? I’ll be honest, I almost put this one in the “Best” category above as it’s a film I enjoy despite itself. Tim Matheson and Stephen Furst headline a goofy ensemble that finds fun, hijinks, and inappropriate comedy in a whitewater rafting race. It’s silly and dumb, but there’s a real sense of fun to be found which goes a long way (especially when compared to too many of today’s “packaged” comedies) in making for an entertaining time. [Extras: Featurette, music video] Youngblood [KL Studio Classics] What is it? A hockey drama! Why see it? It can’t touch 1977’s Slap Shot — nothing can — but this mid 80s drama succeeds all the same in finding some gritty, engaging beats on and off the ice. Rob Lowe is the talented newbie, Patrick Swayze is the wise, older player who takes him under his wing, and the on-ice action is captured well to showcase the talent and brutality on display. You know where things are heading, with the characters and the story, but the performers and the period make it compelling enough. [Extras: Commentary] Also out this week: Cuckoo, Death Becomes Her [4K UHD], Gummo [Criterion], The Hitcher [4K UHD], Oddity, Signs [4K UHD], The Sixth Sense [4K UHD], The Wolfman [4K UHD]",

You know where things are heading, with the characters and the story, but the performers and the period make it compelling enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Extras: Commentary]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso out this week:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eCuckoo, Death Becomes Her [4K UHD], Gummo [Criterion], The Hitcher [4K UHD], Oddity, Signs [4K UHD], The Sixth Sense [4K UHD], The Wolfman [4K UHD]\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
