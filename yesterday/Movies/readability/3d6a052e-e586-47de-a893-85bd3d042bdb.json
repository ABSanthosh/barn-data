  "text": "Following the strong reception to their debut game Fear the Spotlight, Blumhouse games unveiled the sizzle reel for its upcoming slate of games at the CCXP Festival in Mexico City. Blumhouse games will soon unveil release windows for the three distinct and terrifying experiences: Crisol, a first-person action-adventure set in a twisted vision of Spain; Sleep Awake, a psychedelic descent into the space between sleep and death and Grave Seasons, a game that combines family, fishing – and hunting a serial killer. The company’s debut game was the Cozy Game Pals’ atmospheric horror adventure Fear the Spotlight. The game serves as a twisted and loving homage to classic 90s teen horror stories, as it centers around two young women named Vivian and Amy as they sneak into a school after hours to solve a disturbing mystery behind a school tragedy that occurred decades before. The reel was one of several items that were unveiled on the festival Sunday including a new trailer and poster for the upcoming sequel to The Black Phone. Blumhouse Founder and CEO Jason Blum took the stage in Mexico City to mark the company’s 15th anniversary and unveil a slate of updates, exclusive footage and surprise reveals. James Wan, Atomic Monster CEO + Founder, was also in attendance. Watch on Deadline Watch the sizzle reel below.",
