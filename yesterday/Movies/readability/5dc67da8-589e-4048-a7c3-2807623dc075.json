Sources close to the company said these execs’ contracts came to an end and were simply not renewed. “Team Proximity wishes them the best in their future endeavors,” they said. “After a record-breaking year, the company is excited for what the future holds.” Cho was with Proximity for nearly four years, serving as Senior Vice President, Film. With the company for around the same amount of time, King worked on the television side as Executive Vice President. Levy was there for a little over two years, serving as Director of Development, Film. Founded in 2018, Coogler’s production company Proximity Media is coming off a major win with Sinners, Coogler’s period vampire movie starring Michael B. Jordan in dual roles, which released in April, grossing over $365 million worldwide. Rated 97% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, the film has been one of the most discussed of the year and is viewed as a likely awards contender. Coogler directed the film from his own script and produced alongside Zinzi Coogler and Sev Ohanian. Watch on Deadline Most recently, Proximity came aboard to produce Doppelgänger, a film that landed at Skydance after a bidding war earlier this summer with Searching and Run helmer Aneesh Chaganty aboard to direct. Other recent projects, in addition to Sinners, include the Jordan-directed Creed III and Peter Nicks’ music doc Anthem.",
