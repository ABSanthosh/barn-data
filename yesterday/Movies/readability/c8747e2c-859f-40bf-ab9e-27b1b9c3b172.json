  "text": "A new musical era from Karol G begins with the premiere of the Colombian singer’s new “Latina Foreva” single. A celebration of Latinas everywhere, “Latina Foreva” was produced by Mazzarri and Misha and ends with a sample of a viral video featuring “Euphoria” actor Alexa Demie. In the popularized soundbite, Demie playfully asks, “Why does everybody ask me if I’m Latina, isn’t it obvious?” The hard-hitting reggaeton song was supported with the release of a music video featuring Karol and friends skiing on snowy mountain tops in extravagant and glimmering heels and bikini tops and bottoms. The video was directed by Pedro Artola and filmed in Mammoth Lakes, Calif. It also features flamenco guitarist Jose Del Tomate. Popular on Variety Karol began teasing a new musical era by posting bold orange-toned photos and videos on her social media. In one carousel post on Instagram, she included a screengrab of the snowy music video, specifically a close up of her panties, embroidered with the name “Ivonny.” Before this single, the Grammy-winning artist released the song “Milagros,” which debuted in the credits of her Netflix documentary, “Tomorrow Was Beautiful.” The film, directed by Cristina Costantini, runs for nearly two hours and tells the story of Karol’s climb to the top of the music industry, and her record-breaking “Mañana Será Bonito Tour” stadium tour. Karol’s first release this year was “Milagros,” produced by Edgar Barrera, and despite not releasing an album last year, she spawned a hit single with the electro-merengue “Si Antes Te Hubiera Conocido.” She released the song in June, and it topped Billboard’s overall Latin Airplay chart for over 25 weeks, breaking the record for the most weeks at No. 1 since the publication launched the list in 1994.
