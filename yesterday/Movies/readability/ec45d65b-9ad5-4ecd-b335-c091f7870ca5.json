  "text": "Sunday’s Golden Globe Awards averaged 10.1 million viewers across CBS and Paramount+ (and the CBS app), according to Dick Clark Productions, up 7.4 percent from last January’s show. DCP, the producer of the Globes, used VideoAmp Overnight Data and CBS’ own streaming data to arrive at the number. The 2024 Golden Globes, hosted by comedian Jo Koy, averaged 9.4 million viewers across the same platforms, up 50 percent from the previous Globes telecast on NBC (but nowhere near the show’s pre-COVID levels). The Golden Globes had forever been on NBC until a diversity scandal rocked the show’s former voting body, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. After taking the year off in 2022, NBC aired a stripped-down, awkward Globes in 2023 before letting its TV rights expire; CBS scooped them up in time for the 2024 telecast. Dick Clark Productions, which owns and produces the Golden Globes, is now a Penske Media company. PMC is also IndieWire’s parent company. This year, it was comedian Nikki Glaser’s turn, and she put forward a much better performance than Koy. IndieWire critic Ben Travers called Sunday night’s 82nd Golden Globe Awards “a massive step up from last year’s disaster.” Travers gave Sunday’s show a B-, a nice improvement from 2024’s rough mark: a D. Reports the morning after the show suggest that the producers already want Glazer back for next year. The 2025 Golden Globes had a highly anticipated NFL matchup to contend with. On NBC and Peacock, the 14-2 Minnesota Vikings visited the 14-2 Detroit Lions, who dismissed their visitors without breaking much of a sweat. The NFC North matchup was always going to be Sunday’s No. 1 telecast. It notched an average of 28.5 million viewers, up 24 percent from the January 2024 “Sunday Night Football” game (Buffalo Bills vs. Miami Dolphins) that competed with the Globes. “Shōgun” won Best Television Series — Drama on Sunday, while “Hacks” was named the top TV comedy. Best Motion Picture — Drama went to “The Brutalist,” and “Emilia Pérez” earned the award for top comedy or musical movie of the year. (“Emilia Pérez,” definitely a musical and definitely not a comedy, took home the most total trophies with four.) “Wicked” won the inaugural Cinematic and Box Office Achievement award; find the full winners list here.",
