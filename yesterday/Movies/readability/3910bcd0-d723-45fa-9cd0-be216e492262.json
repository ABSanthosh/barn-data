  "text": "Bad Bunny, the Puerto Rican recording artist, is supporting Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, as he shared a video of her plans for the U.S. territory. Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio‘s endorsement came as Donald Trump held a rally at Madison Square Garden in which one of the speakers, comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, called Puerto Rico a “floating pile of garbage.” In the video shared by Bad Bunny, Harris said, “I will never forget what Donald Trump did, and what he did not do, when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader. He abandoned the island, tried to block aid after back-to-back devastating hurricanes and offered nothing more than paper towels and insults.” The recording artist has 45.6 million Instagram followers. Ricky Martin, who has endorsed Harris and also is a native of Puerto Rico, shared the video of Hinchcliffe’s remark and wrote on Instagram, “This is what they think of us.” Watch on Deadline After Tim Walz and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned Hinchcliffe’s remarks, the comedian wrote on X, “These people have no sense of humor. Wild that a vice presidential candidate would take time out of his ‘busy schedule’ to analyze a joke taken out of context to make it seem racist. I love Puerto Rico and vacation there.” But some Republicans also chided Hinchcliffe. Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL), running for re-election in a state with a heavy population of Puerto Ricans, wrote on X, “This joke bombed for a reason. It’s not funny and it’s not true. Puerto Ricans are amazing people and amazing Americans! I’ve been to the island many times. It’s a beautiful place. Everyone should visit! I will always do whatever I can to help any Puerto Rican in Florida or on the island.”",
