  "text": "Francisco San Martin, a soap opera actor known for originating the role of Dario Hernandez in Days of Our Lives, died Jan. 16 at his home. He was 39. Per the Los Angeles County Coroner’s office, the cause of death was suicide by hanging. Born in Mallorca on Aug. 27, 1985, San Martin’s tenure on Days lasted for six months in 2011. He first appeared on the series as a petty thief, though it was soon revealed he arrived to Salem to investigate a cold case. His character subsequently moved to Argentina following a job promotion, and Hernandez was later portrayed by Jordi Vilasuso from 2016-17. In 2017, San Martin also had an arc on CBS’ The Bold and the Beautiful as Mateo, a handsome groundskeeper at Forrester Manor, who soon becomes involved in one of villainess Sheila’s schemes. Watch on Deadline Additional TV credits include an arc on Jane the Virgin opposite Gina Rodriguez; San Martin portrayed an actor named Fabian Regalo del Cielo, who appeared on Jane’s father Rogelio’s telenovela. He appeared in Seasons 3 and 4, and Jane had a brief but messy relationship with him. According to Forbes and several outlets, Days co-star Camila Banus — who portrayed his on-screen sister Gabi — posted a tribute to San Martin on Instagram: “Pepe, what can I say but I love you and rest in peace, my friend,” she wrote, adding, “Love you mucho mucho mucho; I wish I had told you more.” Per the publication, San Martin began his acting journey in children’s theater productions while growing up in Montana. He returned to Madrid as a teenager, where he worked as a model and started taking acting classes. Eventually, he graduated to appearing in stage, TV and film productions in Spain.
