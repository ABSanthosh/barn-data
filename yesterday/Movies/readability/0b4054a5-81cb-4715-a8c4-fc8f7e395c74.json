  "text": "Netflix has unveiled the first trailer for Guillermo del Toro‘s “Frankenstein” feature film. The streamer gave audiences a first look at the twisted new take on the classic Hollywood monster during its Tudum live event Saturday night. The film’s official logline reads, “A brilliant but egotistical scientist brings a creature to life in a monstrous experiment that ultimately leads to the undoing of both the creator and his tragic creation.” Cast members include Oscar Isaac as Dr. Victor Frankenstein, Mia Goth as Elizabeth, Ralph Ineson as Professor Krempe, Jacob Elordi as The Monster and Chrstoph Watlz as Harlander. The cast also includes Felix Kammerer, Lars Mikkelsen, David Bradley, Christian Covery and Charles Dance. Popular on Variety Earlier in May at the Cannes Film Festival, director del Toro shared his rendition of the lumbering, undead man will be more sympathetic than some previous takes on the classic Mary Shelley horror story. “Somebody asked me the other day, does it have really scary scenes?” del Toro explained during a sit down with Oscar-winning composer Alexandre Desplat. “For the first time, I considered that. It’s an emotional story for me. It’s as personal as anything. I’m asking a question about being a father, being a son… I’m not doing a horror movie — ever. I’m not trying to do that.” Del Toro serves as writer and director as well as producer. J. Miles Dale, Melissa Girotti and Scott Suber also produce. The film is expected release to in November 2025. Check out the trailer below.",
