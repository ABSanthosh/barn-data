  "text": "Some of DC’s oddest and spookiest heroes are gearing up to fight another day. Animated action series “Creature Commandos” has been renewed for Season 2 at Max, Variety reported on December 23. News of Season 2 was announced in the middle of the show’s run. Season 1, which runs for seven episodes, premiered on December 5 with the first two episodes, followed by new episodes released weekly on Thursdays. The finale of the show’s first season is scheduled for January 9. Created by DC Studios co-head James Gunn, “Creature Commandos” is based on the classic DC Comics team, created by writer J.M. DeMatteis and artist Pat Broderick in 1980. The series, set after Gunn’s film “The Suicide Squad” and his TV show “Peacemaker,” focuses on a team of monsters assembled by the U.S. government to save a country from the sorceress Circe. The show is notable as the first entry into Gunn’s DC Universe of films and TV shows, which includes next year’s “Superman.” “Only James Gunn could have conjured this wild band of misfit monsters who tug at your heart and force you to root passionately for them,” said HBO \u0026 Max comedy programming head Amy Gravitt in a statement to Variety. “We couldn’t be more delighted to continue their stories with James, Dean Lorey, Peter Safran and our fantastic partners at DC Studios and Warner Bros. Animation.” “Creature Commandos” stars Indira Varma, Sean Gunn, Alan Tudyk, Zoë Chao, and Frank Grillo as the voices of the titular team. David Harbour voices Eric Frankenstein, while Maria Bakalova, Anya Chalotra, and Viola Davis round out the voice cast. The series is produced by DC Studios and Warner Bros. Animation, and Gunn executive produces with Peter Safran, Dean Lorey, and Sam Register. Rick Morales serves as the supervising producer. “Creature Commandos” has received largely positive reviews since its release earlier this month. In a more mixed review, IndieWire TV critic Ben Travers wrote that “its easy-going, character-first approach to another story about incarcerated criminals thrust together to save the world largely works to its advantage.” “We’re thrilled to team up with Max for another season of ‘Creature Commandos’ mayhem,” Gunn and Safran said in a statement. “From our spectacular first season of ‘Peacemaker’ to the astonishing run of ‘The Penguin’ to the record-breaking launch of ‘Creature Commandos,’ Max has consistently delivered above industry expectations and beyond our wildest imaginings.”",
