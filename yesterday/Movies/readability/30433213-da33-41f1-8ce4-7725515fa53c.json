  "text": "Hollywood is reacting with shock and sadness to actor Julian McMahon‘s death at age 56. After the Golden Globe nominee died Wednesday following a private battle with cancer, several of his peers paid tribute on social media, including co-stars from Charmed, Nip/Tuck and Fantastic Four (2005). Nicolas Cage, who recently starred alongside McMahon in the Cannes midnight title The Surfer, said in a statement to Deadline, “Such deeply saddening news. I spent six weeks working with Julian, and he was the most talented of actors. Our scenes together on The Surfer were amongst my favorites I have ever participated in, and Julian is one of my favorite people. He was a kind and intelligent man. My love to his family.” Rose McGowan, who starred with McMahon on The WB’s Charmed, shared a statement on her Instagram Story. “Oh Julian you force of brilliance, wild talent and humour. For you, your family and loving fans all over the world, I pray comfort.” Watch on Deadline Their co-star Holly Marie Combs remembered McMahon as “my favorite pain in the ass ever,” sharing behind-the-scenes videos of the actor as Cole Turner (aka demonic assassin Balthazar). “One of a kind is an understatement,” she wrote in a post. “Your unyielding zest for life and crazy making sense of humor will be sorely missed. The joy and laughter you were the direct cause of will always be remembered. I hope you find our lady friend and dance in those rose petals.” Brian Krause wrote in a post, “Sad day for our Charmed family! Julian was one of the funniest, devilishly handsome and kind souls! Prayers to his family and close friends! He will surely be missed!” McMahon’s Nip/Tuck co-star Kelly Carlson reacted to the news in a video. “I just heard about the passing of Julian McMahon,” she prefaced, adding: “I’m completely shocked and saddened by it. I didn’t know he wasn’t well for a while.” Carlson added that “my heart goes out” to his family, remembering him as “a good friend” after playing his on-and-off wife on the FX series from 2003 to 2010. “Anyways, Jules, thanks for a great six, seven years on Nip/Tuck together. We had so much fun. Everybody had so much fun. She credited him as “the energy, the charisma, the humor, the looks and everything of Nip/Tuck. And so, I hope he had a peaceful journey. I wish him a peaceful journey. And I know he had a full, great life, so that’s a good thing.” Co-star Dylan Walsh told Deadline, “I’m stunned. We rode this wave together and I loved him. My heart goes out to Kelly and [their daughter] Maddy. Jules! I know you’d want me to say something to make you smile — all the inside jokes. All those years you had my back, and my god, we laughed. My heart is with you. Rest in peace.” Ioan Gruffudd, who played the Mister Fantastic to his Doctor Doom in Fantastic Four (2005) and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007), also reacted to the “terribly sad news.” “Even though we played each other’s nemeses, there was always so much lightness and laughter working together. Every encounter with him was a joy,” he wrote on Instagram. “It was an honor to be Dr. Richards to his Dr. Doom. My heart goes out to his wife and family. God speed Julian.” Michael Chiklis, who played Ben Grimm in the Marvel movies, wrote, “I’m devastated to hear of the passing of my friend Julian. Life is so precious and fragile. My condolences to his family. RIP Jules.” FBI franchise boss Dick Wolf told Deadline, “What shocking news. All of us at Wolf Entertainment are deeply saddened by Julian’s passing and our condolences go out to his entire family.” On Friday, McMahon’s wife Kelly announced his death in a statement shared with Deadline. “With an open heart, I wish to share with the world that my beloved husband, Julian McMahon, died peacefully this week after a valiant effort to overcome cancer,” she said. “Julian loved life. He loved his family. He loved his friends. He loved his work, and he loved his fans. His deepest wish was to bring joy into as many lives as possible. We ask for support during this time to allow our family to grieve in privacy. And we wish for all of those to whom Julian brought joy, to continue to find joy in life,” added Kelly. “We are grateful for the memories.”",
