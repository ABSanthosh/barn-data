  "text": "Adrien Brody hasn’t been invited back to host “SNL” after making an infamously poor choice the first time, but the actor says he is not in fact formally banned from the sketch series. The Oscar frontrunner for “The Brutalist” told Vulture that it was his idea to play a Jamaican man — dreads, exaggerated accent, and all — while introducing the show’s actually-Jamaican musical guest Sean Paul. The pitch didn’t go over super well and the live moment landed with a thud. “I think [series creator and producer] Lorne [Michaels] wasn’t happy with me embellishing a bit, but they allowed me to,” Brody said of his 2002 appearance. “They were all literally agape from me pitching,” Brody said of coming up with the character, which included a dreadlock wig. He performed the bit during the dress rehearsal for the show before doing it to a live television audience. “I thought that was a safe space to do that, weirdly,” Brody added. While there have been rumors that he has been banned by Michaels, Brody said that to his knowledge that is not actually true. “But I also have never been invited back on,” he added, “So I don’t know what to tell you.” The “Saturday Night Live” clip has resurfaced after Brody won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama. “The Brutalist” also won the Golden Globe for Best Picture, Drama. “The Brutalist” will also be recognized for Best Film and Brody for Best Actor at the New York Film Critics Circle. “You’re mine, Jamaica,” Brody says in the below clip from 2002. “I’m on rush stuff. We got the old family in the house. We got Sean Paul, we got Sean Peter, we got Sean Mary, we got Sean John all in the house. We got the original rude boy Sean Paul here. Respect all, respect my auntie. […] Big Jamaica massive! Big Kingston massive!” Brody had hosted “SNL” after making history as the youngest star to win the Oscar for Best Actor at age 29 for “The Pianist.” This years Oscars will take place on Sunday, March 2, 2025; Conan O’Brien hosts.
