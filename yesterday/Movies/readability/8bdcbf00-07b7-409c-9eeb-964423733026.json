  "description": "\"You're screwin' it all up! You have to get your head in the game.\" Samuel Goldwyn Films has revealed an official US trailer for an indie sports drama from Australia titled Kid Snow, which is the same name of the boxer in the film. This originally premiered at the 2024 Sydney Film Festival last year and will be released in the US this February. A washed-up Irish boxer named Kid Snow is faced with a chance to redeem himself when he is offered a rematch against the man he fought a decade prior - a chance to turn the page on the tragedy that changed his life. When he meets single mother Sunny, he is forced to think of a future beyond boxing. The movie stars Billy Howle as Kid Snow, Phoebe Tonkin as Sunny, Tom Bateman, Hunter Page-Lochard, Mark Coles Smith, Nathan Phillips, Shaka Cook, Jack LaTorre, \u0026 Robert Taylor. Reviews are mixed on it, though they still offer some praise saying: \"Goldman gives us a contemplative work here, about broken people trying to let go of the things that hold them back.\" Another story of growing up. Here's the new official trailer (+ poster) for Paul Goldman's film [â€¦]",

Here's the new official trailer (+ poster) for Paul Goldman's film Kid Snow, direct from YouTube: Outback Australia in 1971. Kid Snow (starring Billy Howle), a 30-year-old washed-up Irish fighter in a raucous travelling tent-boxing show, is offered a rematch against the man he fought ten years ago. It's his chance to turn the page on a tragedy that changed his life forever. But when the feisty single mother Sunny crosses Kid's path, he is forced to contemplate a future beyond life on the road. Kid Snow is directed by Australian filmmaker Paul Goldman, director of the movies Australian Rules, All the Way, Suburban Mayhem, Cannot Buy My Soul, \"Conspiracy 365\", and Ego: The Michael Gudinski Story previously. The screenplay is written by John Brumpton, Stephen Cleary, and Shane Danielsen. Produced by Lizzette Atkins, Bruno Charlesworth, and Megan Wynn. This initially premiered at the 2024 Sydney Film Festival last year and it already opened in Australia last year. Samuel Goldwyn Films will debut Goldman's Kid Snow in select US theaters + on VOD starting February 14th, 2025 coming up this winter. Looks good? Want to watch?
