  "text": "Nikki Glaser isn’t a comedian known for impressions, but she’d sure like to imitate Nicole Kidman. The comedian said while at The Hollywood Reporter’s Women in Entertainment Gala that Kidman’s film and television career is aspirational. Hell, even her commercials are “iconic,” and Glaser pointed out that even rabid “Wicked” fans had to pay their respects to Kidman’s commanding screen presence pre-film. “She’s just insane. She’s aging backwards,” Glaser, who will be the host of the 2025 Golden Globes during Kidman’s buzzy awards year, said. “Even the AMC moment, that has become this iconic meme moment. The other day, when I went to go see ‘Wicked,’ people applauded after the AMC thing.” Glaser, who cited “Eyes Wide Shut” and “Practical Magic” among her favorite Kidman films, continued: “She’s just someone that we’ve watched for so long and she’s just timeless. It’s incredible to be in the same room as her.” Kidman was on hand to receive the Sherry Lansing Leadership Award at the Women in Entertainment Gala. Kidman’s also got an Oscar (“The Hours”). What she does not have are any regrets over those viral theatrical spots. Go meme-crazy, Kidman says. When asked by The Hollywood Reporter if she considers it a compliment to be memed, Kidman said, “Of course. You’ve got to let go and be able to make fun of yourself. It’s very much an Australian trait, but I think it’s a necessary trait for life. I know who I am. I try to stay deeply focused on my authentic self and stay with that. Everything else is beyond my control.” Kidman added, though, “But let’s wait and see what happens with the [memes from] ‘Babygirl.’ I may be terribly upset the next time you talk to me.” Somehow, heartbreak feels horrible on social media. The AMC ad was filmed over one weekend while Kidman had a break in production on Amazon film “Being the Ricardos.” (She was Oscar-nominated for that one.) Kidman recruited the feature’s cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and Oscar-winning screenwriter Billy Ray to craft the big-screen commercial. AMC Entertainment chief Adam Aron said that more Kidman-led ads would debut in 2024, including a recut version of the 2021 campaign titled “We Make Movies Better.” Aron also teased a new ad is in the works with the “First Lady of AMC” Kidman. However, there has yet to be more Kidman AMC collaborations released. “Babygirl” will be released in theaters December 25; AMC is the largest U.S. theater chain.",
