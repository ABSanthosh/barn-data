The previous episode of Love Island USA Season 7 ended on a cliffhanger following the dumping of Olandria Carthen and Nic Vansteenberghe after they were left single. However, at the end of the episode, Olandria was seen arriving at the main villa to pick Nic up after he was dumped. Episode 21 opens with the Islanders arriving at a remote location, surrounded by tiki torches, and a table at the center, where they catch up on all the Casa Amor drama. During their date, Olandria tells Nic that Cierra was exploring the connection she made with Elan Bibas, who she said looked like him. Nic also told Olandria that Taylor Williams had explored a connection with CoCo Watson, but then she recoupled with Ace Greene. When Taylor was left single, Clarke Carraway, who was coupled up with Nic, expressed interest in him, which left him single and vulnerable of being dumped.
