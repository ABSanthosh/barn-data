Recently, Ryan Reynolds shared insights into Taylor Swift’s role in his family, specifically her bond with his children. Swift, who recently referred to herself as their godmother, prompted Reynolds to clarify her connection. In a November 13 interview with Deadline, he confirmed, “She is the godparent to my daughters,” referencing James, Inez, and Betty. Reynolds expressed gratitude for Swift’s recent social media acknowledgment of her special role in his family. He humorously said, “I need that one on my gravestone actually.” Reynolds also noted Swift’s influence on social media, where her millions of followers saw her supportive post about his film Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine with Hugh Jackman. “That was very sweet,” Reynolds remarked before joking that Swift’s endorsement alone could impact box office numbers. Swift’s strong bond with the Reynolds-Lively family was also evident during her recent Eras Tour when Reynolds and Lively were spotted enjoying the concert in New Orleans. When is Taylor Swift’s next show? Taylor Swift will perform at Toronto’s Rogers Centre on November 21, 22, and 23 as part of the next leg of her Eras Tour.
