  "description": "\"People go missing 'round here... It's like the forest just swallows them up.\" Well Go USA has revealed the official trailer for an indie mystery thriller film called Kryptic, from last year's SXSW, marking the feature directorial debut of filmmaker Kourtney Roy. It's ready for release (direct to VOD) starting in May in a few months. A young woman searches for a missing monster hunter, realizing she has an inextricable bond with the creature being pursued. Sometimes when you go hunting for a monster, the monster finds you first.

Only one way to find out when this is on VOD soon. Here's the main official trailer (+ poster) for Kourtney Roy's horror Kryptic, direct from YouTube: Kay (Chloe Pirrie) is in trouble. A strange encounter in the woods has left her with no memory. Only one thing is certain: she is the spitting image of missing monster hunter, Barb Valentine. When a mysterious intruder breaks into her house, she runs, with no idea where she’s going; but she knows her only chance to reconnect is to shed more light onto Barb’s mysterious disappearance. Random encounters seem to point her in the right direction, but what was hoped to be a journey of self-discovery gradually becomes a hunt for the monster itself. Kryptic is directed by indie filmmaker Kourtney Roy, making her feature directorial debut after a few other short films previously. The screenplay is written by Paul Bromley. Produced by Josh Huculiak, Amber Ripley, and Sophie Venner. This initially premiered at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival last year. Well Go USA will debut Kryptic direct-to-VOD starting May 9th, 2025 coming soon. Who's curious? Find more posts in: Horror, Indies, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
