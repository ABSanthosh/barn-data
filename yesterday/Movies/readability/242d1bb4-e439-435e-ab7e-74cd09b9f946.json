My film was made domestically in Japan and received great acclaim, not only from regular shark movie enthusiasts but also from many viewers who were previously unfamiliar with the genre. I’m very excited to see how this work will be received outside of Japan.\" –Director Morihito Inoue In Atsumi City, where construction of a huge tourist complex led by the mayor, Mankan, is underway, a series of incidents have occurred in which the people while bathing in onsen have suddenly disappeared. What's more, the bodies of unidentified people who had been attacked by sharks in the sea were found. The police chief, Tsuka, and a marine biology doctor, Kose, who set out to investigate, discover the shocking truth that ferocious sharks that have been revived from ancient times are freely moving between the hot springs and attacking people... Hot Spring Shark Attack, originally known as 温泉シャーク or Onsen Shâku in Japanese, is written and directed by newcomer Japanese filmmaker Morihito Inoue, making his feature directorial debut with this film. It first opened in Japan and other countries last summer.
