Atlanta United vs. Inter Miami kicks off at 7 PM ET and 4 PM PT on November 2. Inter Miami are on a roll, having secured the Supporters’ Shield by accumulating the most points in this year’s regular MLS season. Under Lionel Messi’s leadership, the Herons ended their 2024 campaign with 74 points in 34 matches. Meanwhile, Atlanta United barely scraped their way into the playoffs, finishing ninth in the Eastern Conference.
