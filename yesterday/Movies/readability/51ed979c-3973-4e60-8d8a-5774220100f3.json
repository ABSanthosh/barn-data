Warner Bros has unveiled the fun official trailer for A Minecraft Movie, the long-awaited Minecraft film (here's the teaser). Rocking its way theaters in April 2025 next spring. From Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures and starring Jason Momoa and Jack Black, A Minecraft Movie, directed by Jared Hess, is the first-ever big screen, live-action adaptation of Minecraft, the best-selling video game of all time.

Yes this is mainly for all the kids who love the video game already, but come on, this looks like tons of fun! Video game geekiness and goofy kid's jokes. The \"stash\" is super cool to see visualized, and Momoa looks like he's having a blast working on this. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) […]",

The \"stash\" is super cool to see visualized, and Momoa looks like he's having a blast working on this. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Jared Hess' A Minecraft Movie, direct from WB's YouTube: You can rewatch the teaser trailer for Jared Hess' A Minecraft Movie right here, for the first look again. Welcome to the world of Minecraft – where creativity doesn't just help you craft, it's essential to one's survival! Four misfits—Garrett \"The Garbage Man\" Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins \u0026 Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative... the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world. A Minecraft Movie is directed by American comedy filmmaker Jared Hess, director of the fun films Napoleon Dynamite, Nacho Libre, Gentlemen Broncos, Don Verdean, and Thelma the Unicorn previously. The screenplay is by Chris Bowman, Rob McElhenney, Hubbel Palmer, Allison Schroeder, Peter Sollett, Jon Spaihts. Produced by with Roy Lee, Jon Berg, Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Jason Momoa, Jill Messick, Torfi Frans Olafsson and Vu Bui. Warner Bros will debut A Minecraft Movie in theaters starting April 4th 2025 next spring. Does it look any good? Find more posts: Animation, To Watch, Trailer",
