Next month, the park will host several new experiences, while also turning some of its more iconic areas into holiday experiences. Beginning November 22 and running through December 31, 2024, Universal Orlando Resort will offer up a “merry slate of festive experiences inspired by beloved characters and stories,” ranging from things Christmas-themed decorations at The Wizard World of Harry Potter to the appearance of the Grinch and others. Alongside the festive celebrations, Universal Orlando’s hotels will also be decked out in holiday decorations and other “seasonal experiences,” including things like offering up The Universal Holiday Tour and The Grinch \u0026 Friends Character Breakfast. Full list of Universal Orlando Resort holiday celebration activities The full list of experiences coming to Universal Orlando Resort for their holiday experiences is as follows: Christmas in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Islands of Adventure With festive décor, garland, and twinkling lights adorning the streets of Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade, guests will be surrounded by holiday magic as they explore The Wizarding World of Harry Potter this holiday season. Guests can grab a Hot Butterbeer and enjoy special holiday-themed performances by The Frog Choir, comprised of Hogwarts students and their giant frogs, in Hogsmeade, or dance along with the hit-sensation Celestina Warbeck and the Banshees in Diagon Alley. And as night falls in Hogsmeade, the nighttime spectacle, “The Magic of Christmas at Hogwarts Castle,” returns – bringing to life an awe-inspiring projection show on Hogwarts castle highlighting Christmas moments and holiday cheer inspired by the cherished characters and stories from the “Harry Potter” films. Grinchmas at Universal Islands of Adventure Guests can enjoy a live retelling of the Dr. Seuss holiday classic, “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” in the beloved stage show, “Grinchmas Who-liday Spectacular.” Plus, Seuss Landing will transport guests directly to Who-ville, where they’ll be surrounded by whimsical holiday décor and enjoy special appearances from the Whos and even get a chance for a photo opportunity with the mean-one himself – the Grinch!
