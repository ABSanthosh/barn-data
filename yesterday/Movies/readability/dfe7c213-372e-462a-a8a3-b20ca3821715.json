  "text": "CNN political analyst Gloria Borger is exiting the news network after 17 years, and Wolf Blitzer has shown his gratitude for her contributions to The Situation Room over the years. At the end of Thursday, December 19’s broadcast, Blitzer took a moment to thank Borger and remember her first appearance on his show, airing a clip from September 13, 2007. “Everybody stand back for a moment. I want to have a special moment right now to say, ‘Thank you, thank you, thank you,’ to our Gloria Borger. Seventeen years here at CNN. This is going to be your last week here at CNN. You’re getting ready to move on and we want to wish you only the very best,” Blitzer told Borger. “You and I go way back, in fact, your first appearance on CNN was right here in The Situation Room.” The clip showed Blitzer hosting The Situation Room and taking on the topic of George W. Bush’s plans for the war in Iraq. Borger appeared on the show to give her take on those plans, standing opposite Blitzer across from a circular table. Watch on Deadline “Gloria, I speak for all of our viewers here in the United States and indeed, around the world, when I say, ‘Thank you, thank you, thank you,'” Blitzer told Borger after the clip. Borger replied, “It’s been pure joy. It’s been a great 17 years. I’ve worked with the best people in the business [and] the best journalists in the business.” The political commentator noted that in the clip they used to stand for hours to host the show, versus now where they all sit behind a desk to give their hot takes on politics. “It’s been a great pleasure,” she continued. “I’m going to really miss the place, but I’m going to be CNN’s biggest fan, and I’ll be rooting for everyone from the sidelines.” Watch Borger on CNN’s The Situation Room in the video below.
