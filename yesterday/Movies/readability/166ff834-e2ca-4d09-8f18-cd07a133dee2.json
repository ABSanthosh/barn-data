Following his post calling Donald Trump “a traitorous, Putin-loving dip—,” the legendary horror author thanked his native Maine’s Governor Janet Mills after she told the president “we’ll see you in court” over withheld federal funding due to the state’s inclusion of transgender athletes. “Makes me proud to be a Maine man,” wrote King on X. “Thank you, Governor, for standing up to the bully.” Watch on Deadline The Democratic governor met with Trump and other governors on Friday at the White House after his executive order to bar transgender athletes from competing in women’s and girls’ sports, according to the Associated Press. The same day, the U.S. Department of Education announced an investigation into the Maine Department of Education over trans athletes. https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/1893054630843600918 King previously made his return to the Elon Musk-owned social media platform on Thursday, immediately taking aim at Trump. “Just wanted to say that Trump is a traitorous, Putin-loving dip—!
