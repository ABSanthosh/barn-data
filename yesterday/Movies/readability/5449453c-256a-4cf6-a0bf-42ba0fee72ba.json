  "text": "Daniel Craig and Drew Starkey in 'Queer' (2024). Yannis Drakoulidis/A24/Courtesy Everett Collection Despite his latest film being censored, Luca Guadagnino remains cautiously optimistic about the power of filmmaking. After a screening of Queer was banned in Istanbul earlier this month, the Oscar-nominated director vowed to “fight any institution that wants to tarnish” cinema while speaking at the Marrakech International Film Festival, where he presides over this year’s jury. “They banned the movie because they said the movie was creating social disorder,” said Guadagnino in the press conference, according to Agence France Presse. “I really hope they do believe that the form of the movie brings the possibility of societal collapse. Because this means that my belief in the power of cinema is true and not delusional.” Watch on Deadline Based on William S. Burroughs’ 1985 book, Queer follows Lee (Daniel Craig) after fleeing from a drug bust in New Orleans to 1940s Mexico City, where he becomes infatuated with Allerton (Drew Starkey), a young discharged American Navy serviceman. “I wonder if they’ve seen the movie or if they are just judging it by the outline or, let’s say, the facetious stupidity of some journalist focusing on James Bond going gay,” the director mused. Luca Guadagnino attends Deadline Contenders Film: Los Angeles on Nov. 16, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. Guadagnino added, “It’s an obtuse censorship particularly in this world where you can download the movie.” After Mubi acquired multiple territory rights for Queer, the streaming platform canceled its Mubi Fest Istanbul at the last minute after the city’s governor banned its opening screening of the film this month. “Hours before the start of Mubi Fest Istanbul 2024, which took months to prepare and was sold out days ago, we regretted to learn that the screening of Queer, which was part of the festival program and which was also the opening film, has been banned,” Mubi Turkey shared in a statement. “The decision states that the movie is banned because it contains provocative content that would endanger the peace of the society and that the ban would be implemented for security reasons.” The statement continued, “We believe this ban is an intervention that restricts art and freedom of expression… This ban takes not just one movie away but also the meaning and purpose of the entire festival. Mubi wants to take the stance that our audience expects from us and we regret to inform you that we have taken the decision to cancel the entire Mubi Fest Istanbul.” Must Read Stories Read More About: Subscribe to Deadline Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.
