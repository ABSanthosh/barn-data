  "text": "The internet scene reportedly became tense recently after Amazon Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk indulged in a back-and-forth on X (formerly Twitter). The discussion revolving around the re-election of Donald Trump made users on X wonder whether all things are okay between the two business moguls. Here are the details of Bezos and Musk’s alleged online beef. What happened to Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk? Since the historic win by Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential elections, Elon Musk’s Tesla and SpaceX have benefited immensely. However, in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), the tech giant aimed at Jeff Bezos. He alleged that the Amazon founder had urged people to sell their Tesla and SpaceX shares, predicting that Trump wouldn’t win. Elon Musk wrote, “Just learned tonight at Mar-a-Lago that Jeff Bezos was telling everyone that @realDonaldTrump would lose for sure, so they should sell all their Tesla and SpaceX stock.” However, Bezos took the opportunity to debunk the allegations and replied to Musk, “Nope. 100% not true.” The Tesla CEO further responded to Bezos by writing, “Well, then, I stand corrected.” This back-and-forth became one of the key highlights on X as users stormed into the comments giving their opinions on it. Since, Trump’s win with the majority electoral votes in the elections he and Musk have been on a roll. Besides Trump’s victory being beneficial for Tesla and SpaceX’s stock, as per a report by the New York Post, Musk has also found himself becoming a part of Trump’s administration. Following his win, Donald Trump named Elon Musk to team up with Vivek Ramaswamy to head the Department of Government Efficiency, also known as DOGE. As shared by Musk on X, in the statement announcing Musk as DOGE head, Trump wrote, “I am pleased to announce that the Great Elon Musk, working in conjunction with American Patriot Vivek Ramaswamy, will lead the Department of Government Efficiency (“DOGE”).”",
