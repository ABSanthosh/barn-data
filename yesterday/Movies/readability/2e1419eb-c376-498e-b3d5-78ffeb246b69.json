  "text": "Billboard Women in Music 2025 It’s not that Neil Young doesn’t want to tour the U.S.; The 2X Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee questions whether it will be possible for him to tour the U.S. again given his criticism of President Donald Trump. “If I talk about Donald J. Trump, I may be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on a cement floor with an aluminum blanket,” Young writes on his Neil Young Archives site, referencing situations like that actress Jasmine Mooney found herself in last month. “That is happening all the time now…If I come back from Europe and am barred, can’t play my USA tour, all of the folks who bought tickets will not be able to come to a concert by me.” The “Keep on Rockin’ in the Free World” singer is from Canada but has dual citizenship. His Love Earth world tour is set to kick off June 18 in Rättvik, Sweden and continuethrough Europe and the U.K., with North American dates beginning in North Carolina on August 8 before concluding at the Hollywood Bowl on September 15. “I love America and its people and its music and its culture,” Young writes. “By these latest actions of the US government, it seems that those who speak freely with their own opinions are now vulnerable to non-existent Trump law. “The fact that I think Donald Trump is the worst president in the history of our great country could stop me from coming back, what does that say about Freedom?” Asserting that Trump is unable to stand up to criticism, he asks, “How spineless is that?”",
