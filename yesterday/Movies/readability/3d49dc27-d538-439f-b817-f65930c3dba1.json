Den Of Thieves 2: Pantera claims the box office top spot with over $20 million despite a $40 million budget. Future Den Of Thieves movies are mapped out, ensuring more thrilling heists and character developments. Den Of Thieves franchise shows strong potential for continuation and audience satisfaction. If you've been a longtime fan of the Den Of Thieves franchise, you might be excited to know that there's potential for much more. Because, during an interview with Collider, franchise writer and director Christian Gudegast discussed the future of the franchise—and apparently, there are already plenty of plans in place with more to come. Here's what's being said about the overarching Den Of Thieves cinematic journey. Gudegast explains, \"When I was researching Den 1, there was just so much material that we knew right away it wasn't going to be — you hope that it performs, and luckily, it did — a one-off, but that we have many, many of these to go. The next one's already ready to go, and then 4 and 5 are already mapped out simply because of the amount of material to come across and where we want to take these characters.\" As of now, Den Of Thieves 2: Pantera has already managed to nab the top spot at the box office with over $20 million on a budget of $40 million. Obviously, the franchise will need to make more to validate the existence of more movies, but it's definitely off to a strong start! Gerard Butler as 'Big Nick' O'Brien in DEN OF THIEVES 2: PANTERA.
