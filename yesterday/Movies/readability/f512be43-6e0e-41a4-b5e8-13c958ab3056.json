  "text": "Jill Jacobson, a film and television actress known for her work on “Star Trek: The Next Generation” and the primetime soap opera “Falcon Crest,” died Dec. 8 in Los Angeles. She was 70 years old. Jacobson’s death was confirmed to Variety by publicist Daniel Harary, a friend of Jacobson’s, who noted the actress died after a battle with “a long illness.” After graduating from the University of Texas in Austin, Jacobson moved to Los Angeles where she began her acting career with the title role in “Nurse Sherri.” She went on to star in “Star Trek: The Next Generation,” “Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,” “Days of Our Lives,” “Hung,” “Newhart,” “Castle” and “Who’s the Boss?”  Notably, she played the recurring roles of Erin Jones on “Falcon Crest” and Larue Wilson on “The New Gidget” at the same time. Jacobson appeared on 22 episodes of “Falcon Crest” and eight episodes of “The New Gidget,” respectively. Popular on Variety Caryn Richman, Jacobson’s “New Gidget” co-star, remarked on her lifetime friend’s passing: “Jill’s comic timing was brilliant. And her enthusiasm and love of life made our time together on set joyful.” Jacobson’s other television credits include “Crazy Like a Fox,” “Quantum Leap,” “Arliss” and “Murphy Brown.” Her film credits include Ron Howard’s “Splash,” “Bad Georgia Road,” “Forbidden Love” and “Baby Sister.” She also made multiple stage appearances and performed stand-up comedy routines at LA’s The Improv and The Comedy Store. Outside of her work in entertainment, Jacobson was a spokesperson who volunteered with the American Cancer Society.",
