  "text": "Lois spends the entire first season trying to find out the Grotesquerie killer’s identity. During the first half of the season, we get some clues that narrow down who the killer could be, and it seems like Lois has finally caught them. However, when she comes out of her coma, those clues become irrelevant. So, now we have to wonder who the real killer is and why they’re copying the crimes in Lois’s dreams. Do we know the identity of the Grotesquerie killer? The killer in Lois’s coma turned out to be the Catholic priest Charlie Mayhew and the nun, Sister Megan Duval. They conspired to commit ritualistic murders to scare the public back into the church. However, in episode seven, we learn none of that is real when Lois awakens. Instead, Charlie is her doctor, and Megan is the police chief at the department from which Lois has retired. While the Grotesquerie murders turn out to just be a part of Lois’s coma-induced fantasies, someone decides to make them real. The first murders, with the family and the baby in the boiling pot, once again don’t have a connection to Lois. However, the second copycat killing has Dr. Charlie Mayhew and a woman who just accused Marshall of sexual assault as victims. In the season finale, Dr. Witticomb hints that Lois might have been the one to murder the family, but the discovery of the second set of murders seems to exonerate her. She was locked up in a padded cell when those occurred, so it’s likely not her. The Mexicali Men’s Club would theoretically have motivations to commit a crime like that. They have a desire to return to “traditional values,” and Charlie looks a bit uncomfortable and seems to leave early. Perhaps his loyalty to the group was in question, and so they killed him. In that case, his crucifixion could be symbolic, killing one of their own to “save” the rest. Additionally, murdering a woman who accused their latest member of sexual assault would certainly cement Marshall’s association with the group. However, the men’s group seems like a red herring. It’s almost too perfect that it’s essentially Lois’s Legion of Doom. Additionally, while their motives for forming the club might be dubious, none of them have been revealed to be killers. As the Grotesquerie season finale closes, Lois says she knows exactly who the killer is. Notably, she uses the singular there, indicating she doesn’t believe there are two or more people involved in this string of murders. So, if she’s right, we’re looking for one person who Lois knows. Unfortunately, that’s about all we have to go on for now. Hopefully, the show will get renewed for season two so we can finally get the answers we’re looking for.",
