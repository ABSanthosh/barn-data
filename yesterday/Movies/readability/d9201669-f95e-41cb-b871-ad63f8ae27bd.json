I really wanted to like this feature when I sat down to watch it, and a lot about it is quite good. It's gorgeously shot, capturing the colors and themes of its period setting and exquisite set pieces. Krsy Fox does serviceable work as beleaguered mother Mindy, wearing her exhaustion on her face. As a character hounded by her insecurities, imposter syndrom, and fears of maternal failings, her hangdog expressions speak to countless parents with metaphorical demons making the process of raising a child that much more difficult. Skarloff's Agyar is menacing and oddly philosphic, prowling Mindy's basement like some physical manifesation of her anxieties. Crampton is always a delight, and Chaz Bono's extended appearance is a comedic and awkward highlight of the film. Langenkamp is, frankly, shoehorned in the picture in an inexplicable cameo. Its shortcomings are just an overall lack of narrative focus. Coming in at 105 minutes, there's plenty of time for the film to fill in some nagging questions and give the proceedings a bit more gravity than they have with their bare bones, but chooses not to. Long sequences of Mindy's isolation are drawn out to decent effect, ostensibly allowing us to sit in her unease, but some of that time could've been put to better use expanding the lore of Agyar. As a monster film, most of us are tuning in for the monster, so give us more. The ending(s) are questionable: the first one is suprising but not entirely sensible and the second one is seemingly purposeless. The creature effects and tension are good but once the credits start rolling the viewer doesn't feel quite complete. There's a lot of room in LITTLE BITES that isn't adequately filled. It is apparent that Spider One is a director with vision and talent but I personally feel like he needs a guiding hand to reach his full potential. Watching the credits, one can see that there was very little in the way of a larger community making this film happen - it was mostly Spider One and Krsy Fox and there weren't a lot of checks and balances along the way of their making a decision and putting it on screen. However, I think if there were a few other heads in the room, this film might've benefited from a few outside ideas.  That said, LITTLE BITES shows great potential and is a fun little midnight monster movie. I feel confident that the next picture from this writer and director will be more ambitious and have a great deal more flesh on its bones. LITTLE BITES is releasing on physical media Tuesday, February 18th and will begin streaming on SHUDDER on Friday, February 21st. Until next time, take care of yourselves. -McEric, aka Eric McClanahan-",
