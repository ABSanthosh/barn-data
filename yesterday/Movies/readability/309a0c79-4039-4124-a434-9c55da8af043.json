  "text": "Peacock‘s new TV and movie releases for January 20-26 2025 include a new episode of The Traitors Season 3 and The Wild Robot. January 23 brings a new episode of The Traitors Season 3 to Peacock. This series follows contestants called “Faithfuls” who take part in a series of daunting challenges. The ultimate aim of the contestants is to build a prize pool worth over $250 million. However, the “Faithfuls” must contend with some contestants, branded “Traitors.” The goal of the “Traitors” is to eliminate the other players and claim the prize money for themselves. Notable cast members this season include Rob Mariano, Dylan Efron, and Nikki Garcia, among others. The Wild Robot streams on Peacock on January 24. The story follows an intelligent robot who gets stranded on a desolate island. The robot then bonds with the animals residing there, while caring for an orphaned baby goose. Lupita Nyong’o, Pedro Pascal, Bill Nighy, Stephanie Hsu, Matt Berry, Mark Hamill, and Catherine O’Hara, make up the voice cast. Also releasing on Peacock this week is the extended and uncensored version of The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Season 5 Reunion Part 1. Here, fans can expect the housewives to discuss events chronicled in Season 5, and their feelings regarding them, like Bronwyn confronting Lisa over a hurtful comment she made about Bronwyn’s daughter.
