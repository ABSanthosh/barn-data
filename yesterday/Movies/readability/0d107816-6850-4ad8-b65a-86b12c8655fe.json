  "text": "Voight’s unit is changing once again on “Chicago P.D.” Toya Turner, who joined the show during Season 12, will not return for the upcoming season in the fall. “My time on Chicago P.D. has come to a close. This show challenged me, sharpened me, and revealed what l’m made of. I’ve evolved through this experience, both as an artist and in my craft, and I’m walking away with depth, clarity, and momentum for whatever comes next,” Turner wrote via Instagram on Thursday. “To the cast and crew: thank you for the warmth, the laughter, and the generosity you brought every day. It was an honor to share the screen and the set with such talent.” She continued, “To the ChiHards: thank you for welcoming me, rooting for me, and showing Kiana love. And to everyone who believes in me: your support means the world. I’m excited for the opportunities ahead.” Popular on Variety Turner’s Kiara often worked with Kim Burgess (Marina Squerciati), Dante Torres (Benjamin Levy Aguilar) and Kevin Atwater (LaRoyce Hawkins). During the ATX TV Festival in May, Squerciati opened up about the difficulties of saying goodbye to actors, revealing that sometimes she’s hesitant to get close to someone knowing that there’s a chance they could leave at anytime. Turner joined following the exit of Tracy Spiridakos, who last appeared on the Season 11 finale, and left the show after eight seasons. There have been many changes in the “One Chicago” universe, as neither Daniel Kyri or Jake Lockett will return for Season 14.",
