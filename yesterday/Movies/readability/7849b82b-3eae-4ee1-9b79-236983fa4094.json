  "text": "CBS has canceled its long-running action drama “S.W.A.T.” after eight seasons and 163 episodes, the show’s producers and stars were told on Thursday. But this represents the third time “S.W.A.T.” has been cancelled by the Eye net — so it’s probably tough to tell at this point if it’s really, really the end. The series, which stars Shemar Moore as Daniel “Hondo” Harrelson, was brought back to life for a Season 8 after CBS previously announced that its seventh season would be its last. And that wasn’t its first time, as CBS also axed the show in 2023 after Season 6, before announcing it would return for one last run. In both cases, after the initial cancellation, CBS, Sony Pictures TV and CBS Studios were able to work out the deal to bring the show back at a license fee that made sense for all involved. But this time, it appears the third time may not be the charm and “S.W.A.T.” may really be over. “S.W.A.T.,” which airs Fridays at 8 p.m., received a full 22-episode order this season, of which 13 have aired so far (meaning there are still nine to go). Popular on Variety “It’s heartbreaking news, primarily because it’s been such an immense pleasure working with this cast and crew to put out a show that we’ve always been proud of,” said showrunner/exec producer Andrew Dettman. “They are truly an extraordinary group of people who have all worked so hard and have been so dedicated for all these eight seasons, overcoming countless challenges. I can’t give them enough credit. I feel so privileged to have been a part of the S.W.A.T. family.” Besides Moore, “S.W.A.T.” also stars Jay Harrington, David Lim, Patrick St. Esprit, Anna Enger Ritch and Niko Pepaj. “S.W.A.T.” is produced by Sony Pictures Television in association with CBS Studios. The series is exec produced by Shawn Ryan, Andrew Dettmann, Justin Lin, Neal H. Moritz, Marney Hochman, Pavun Shetty, Billy Gierhart, Shemar Moore, James Scura, Sarah Alderson and Kent Rotherham. “It’s been an extraordinary privilege to work on S.W.A.T. for eight seasons and tell the stories of Hondo and 20-Squad,” Ryan said. “I thank our fans, Shemar Moore, the rest of our cast, our producers, Sony Pictures Television, CBS Studios and CBS for the opportunity. Most of all I want to thank our tireless, dedicated crew who made our writers, directors and cast always look good. My greatest concern right now is for them.” “S.W.A.T” is inspired by the series of the same name created by Robert Hamner that ran on ABC for one season from 1975 to 1976. News comes as CBS also canceled two more dramas, “FBI: Most Wanted” and “FBI: International,” earlier this week. Like “S.W.A.T.,” which comes from Sony, the “FBI” series also come from an outside studio: Universal TV. Last month, CBS renewed nine series: “NCIS,” “NCIS: Origins,” “NCIS: Sydney,” Tracker,” “George \u0026 Mandie’s First Marriage,” “Hollywood Squares,” “Elsabeth,” “Fire Country” and “Ghosts” (which landed a two-season pickup). The network has also ordered “Boston Blue,” a spinoff of “Blue Bloods” for next season, as well as “Fire Country” spinoff “Sheriff Country.”",
