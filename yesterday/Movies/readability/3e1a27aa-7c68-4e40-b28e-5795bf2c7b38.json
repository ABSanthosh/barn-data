  "text": "Zachary Levi John Russo If Zachary Levi has been canceled in Hollywood for supporting Donald Trump, no one has told him. While appearing on Bill Maher’s Club Random podcast, the host asked the Shazam! actor if he got canceled for leaning right in the election. “No,” Levi told him. “For coming out and voting for Trump? I mean, listen, I have yet to see what the ultimate effects of all that are gonna be. I already had multiple jobs that I was in the process of shooting or that I have yet to shoot, and none of those have been compromised. None of my producers or any of the studios behind those films or projects have called and said, ‘Hey listen this is a line too far, and we can’t have you associated with the project anymore.’ We’re all still full steam ahead on those. How it ultimately plays out in the future? I don’t know.” Recently, actress Laura Benanti admitted that Levi will have success with his newfound fanbase after endorsing Trump for president. Those comments came after she slammed Levi for his unfounded comments about Gavin Creel‘s death while appearing on That’s a Gay Ass Podcast. Watch on Deadline “Everyone’s like, ‘It’s career suicide.’ But it’s not career suicide because Christian, faith-based TV and film is huge,” Benanti said. “He’s going to be a huge f—ing star in that realm. He’s going to make more money than he ever has. It makes me nauseous, but also a little bit, like, ‘I told you, motherf—er.’” Levi’s previous releases Shazam! Fury of the Gods and Harold and the Purple Crayon proved unsuccessful at the box office.
