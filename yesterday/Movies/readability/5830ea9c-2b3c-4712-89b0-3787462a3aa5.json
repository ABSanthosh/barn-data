  "description": "\"No matter how hard it gets, you stick your chest out.\" Briarcliff Ent. has revealed an official trailer for a military thriller called Valiant One, marking the feature directorial debut of producer Steve Barnett. This is ready for release early next year in theaters starting at the end of January 2025. In the heart-pounding military thriller Valiant One, a routine mission spirals into a fight for survival when a US Army helicopter crashes deep within North Korean territory. With strained tensions between North \u0026 South Korea, the team of survivors must work together to protect one more civilian and find their way out without the help of US military support. They desperately race across the treacherous Demilitarized Zone. Valiant One stars Chase Stokes, Lana Condor, Desmin Borges, and Callan Mulvey. Another upcoming jingoistic war movie to watch if you need an adrenaline rush in the cinema next year. This has a mix of action thriller footage along with an intense survival story - that's more about them figuring how to stick together and make it out safely.
