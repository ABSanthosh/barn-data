While speaking at Universal Fan Fest Nights on Friday (via People), “Back to the Future” screenwriter Bob Gale shut down the possibility of any more follow-ups to the classic 1985 film after the “Cobra Kai” finale teased a television adaptation. “I don’t know why they keep talking about that!” Gale said. “I mean, do they think that if they say it enough times, we’re going to actually do it?” Popular on Variety He continued, “I mean, it’s like they know in every interview people say, ‘Oh Bob, when is there going to be a “Back to the Future 4”?’ Never. ‘When is there going to be a prequel?’ Never. ‘When is there going to be a spinoff?’ Never. It’s just fine the way it is. It’s not perfect, but as Bob Zemeckis used to say, ‘It’s perfect enough.’” Gale went on to say that if the higher-ups demanded he revive the franchise, it would take some serious convincing. “If the juggernaut of corporate America or corporate international mishigas says, ‘If you don’t agree to this, we’re going to kill your children,’ alright, well, no, we don’t want our children killed,’” Gale joked. “But Steven Spielberg, of course, he’s got to sign off on it, too. And Steven, just like Steven won’t allow another ‘E.T.,’ he totally respects the fact that we don’t want any more ‘Back to the Future.’ He gets it and always stood behind that. And thank you, Steven.” Looking back on the 40 year history of “Back to the Future,” Gale said he is proud to have helped create a film that has remained a classic through generations. “What’s so great is seeing the next generation of kids that are being touched by this and [say], ‘Gee, my parents were once kids,’” Gale said. “That’s why I think it keeps on going, because every kid comes to that realization at some point, and we made a movie about that. So I love the fact that people are newly discovering it.” Although “Back to the Future” is staying off screens, the film has been adapted into a musical. Gale said he remains “humbled” by the praise of international fans. “We’ve made ‘Back to the Future: The Musical,’ which is still playing in London, it’s on a U.S. tour,” Gale explained. “We just opened it in Tokyo in Japanese, and they’re just as crazy, or crazier, over there about that whole ‘Back to the Future’ as anywhere else. So, I mean, I’m humbled and blown away by the fact that Bob and I came up with something that has this much staying power.” While “Back to the Future” isn’t receiving any new sequels, the 1985 original was followed by “Back to the Future Part II” in 1989 and “Back to the Future Part III” in 1990.",
