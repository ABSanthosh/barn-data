During the Star Wars Celebration in Japan, the actor confirmed that he would return to the Star Wars universe as the Jedi Knight who turned to the dark side of the Force, becoming the Sith Lord Darth Vader. “There’s a lot that we could still explore with Vader,” Christensen told ComicBook in an interview. “I think from where we left off, after Episode III, and everything that he has to reconcile after he’s trapped in this new version of himself, there’s just a lot of very rich stories that we could still tell.” Christensen noted that he loves the character and added, “I’d love to get to continue with it, and so hopefully we’ll get to do more of it.” Watch on Deadline The actor first played the role of Anakin in 2002’s Star Wars: Episode II — Attack of the Clones. Christensen would reprise his role in 2005’s Star Wars: Episode III — Revenge of the Sith. It was in the Disney+ series Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022), where Christensen returned to play the role of Darth Vader, reuniting with his former master, played by Ewan McGregor. RELATED: Hayden Christensen Speaks Out On His ‘Star Wars’ Casting And The Negative Reactions To The Film In a separate interview, Christensen opened up about what he likes about playing the Star Wars character. “I think my understanding of the character is just continuing to grow,” he told Complex. “We’re getting to explore different sides of Anakin, which I’m really enjoying. I’m just enjoying the journey.” He continued, “He’s a very complex character, and there’s a lot going on. But I’m really loving getting to sort of play the more heroic side of the character in the Ahsoka show, and I’m very excited for Season 2.”",
