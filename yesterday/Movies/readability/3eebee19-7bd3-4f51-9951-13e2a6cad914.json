  "description": "Scott Adkins talks with McEric about his new action film, DIABLO Read the full article on AICN If you’re a fan of current action films then you likely know the name Scott Adkins. He’s either kicked the ass of or had his ass kicked by every action star of the last five decades: Dolph Lundgren, Jackie Chan, Sylvester Stallone, Jean Claude Van Damme, Jet Li, and even Keanu Reeves. That’s right - he was the big guy with the grill in JOHN WICK CHAPTER 4.  Scott’s newest film is DIABLO, which hits theaters and on demand this Friday, June 13th. Conceived alongside action compatriot Marko Zaror, the film takes place in Colombia following Adkins as Kris, a former convict, who seeks to make good on a promise to a fallen friend, which runs him afoul of Zaror’s mercenary, El Corvo. This film isn’t just another straight-to-streaming no-budget piece of content - DIABLO delivers on every front. The fight scenes, choreographed by Zaror, are intense and deftly photographed, thanks to director Ernesto Diaz Espinoza.

The six-foot-two Chilean action star has a chilling villain introduction, followed by a massive action scene in a sketchy hideout that plays out like a scene from TERMINATOR.

Their final confrontation is a throwback to the intensity of third act showdowns from our best memories of the eighties and nineties. I asked Adkins about the decision to place the film in Colombia, particularly after a scene when Kris goes to steal a car, any car, and finds one on the street and sure enough, there’s a gun in the glovebox. As a film device it makes sense, but if one stops to consider it as commentary on the region, it becomes a bit troublesome. However, DIABLO doesn’t really require one do such a thing; it’s an action fisticuffs banger that is surprisingly well done and satisfying. Adkins is the last of a dying breed, and he’s really damn good at what he does. I had the pleasure of speaking to Scott Adkins earlier today to ask about reteaming with Marko Zaror, shooting in Colombia, working with his young co-star Alanna de la Rossa, and his very distinctive on-camera run.  Sorry, I had to. Okay, here’s the interview [mild spoilers ahead]. I really enjoyed chatting with Scott Adkins and he’s such a jovial bloke that I wish we had more than eight minutes. If you want to spend ninety minutes with Adkins, and the killing machine Marko Zaror, be sure to check out DIABLO, in theaters and on demand this Friday, June 13th, just in time for Fathers’ Day. Until next time, take care.-McEric, aka Eric McClanahan-",
