  "text": "What a difference a year makes for Benson Boone, who told Variety on the American Music Awards red carpet Monday in Las Vegas. that “things are picking up in speed” in the year since he opened for Taylor Swift on a London stop on her record-smashing Eras tour. “It just never stops coming in. There’s always shows to play, there’s always songs to write, there’s always things to release, there’s always videos to post,” Boone told Variety‘s Marc Malkin. “Sometimes it can be exhausting, but at the same time — I love doing this. I love putting myself out there.” Boone’s debut album “Fireworks and Rollerblades” scored for Warner Records last year with breakout tune “Beautiful Things.” The 22-year-old singer-songwriter is preparing to release his second studio album, “American Heart,” in June. Boone told Malkin that his dream collaborator is Bruno Mars. He added that his new album is partly inspired by Mars’ brand of power-pop and R\u0026B. “It’s nostalgic for me. I think a lot of people my age grew up listening to Bruno in middle school and in high school. He’s huge. He’s the best, he’s insane. He’s the greatest — such a spectacular talent. And I would obviously love to work with him,” Boone said. After a beat Boone added that the album set for release June 20 on Warner Bros. Records is “my best shot at doing my own version of Bruno.” Morever, he added, “This album means so much to me. I think it is the best body of work I’ve ever made.” The American Music Awards air live from Las Vegas on CBS and Paramount+.",
