It goes right on my watchlist. Seems like it's more than just one kind of monster - all kinds of malevolent forces are out to terrorize these young home owners. Here's the festival teaser trailer for William Bagley's horror comedy Hold the Fort, direct from YouTube: Hold the Fort follows Lucas \u0026 Jenny (Chris Mayers \u0026 Haley Leary) who think their life is finally coming together when the couple become homeowners. Little do they know that their new house comes with a big catch. Lucas and Jenny soon find themselves in a fight for their lives when they become trapped in a battle between their Homeowners Association and an onslaught of monsters from hell. The horror-comedy takes the timely concern of home-ownership and wraps this up in an entertaining action-packed thrill ride. Hold the Fort is written and directed by American genre filmmaker William Bagley, director of the horror film The Murder Podcast previously, plus a few other shorts. Based on a story by Scott Hawkins. It's produced by Matt Dodd, Luke Williams, Tim Reis, Julian Smith. This is premiering at the 2025 Fantasia Film Festival in Montreal this summer. Blue Finch Films will release Bagley's Hold the Fort film later this year - stay tuned for more updates. No other release dates or festivals are confirmed just yet. First impression? Who's down?
