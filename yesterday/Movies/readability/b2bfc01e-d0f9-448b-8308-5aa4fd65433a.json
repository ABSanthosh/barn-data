What did Colin Farrell say about The Penguin Season 2? Speaking to Variety behind the scenes at the SAG Awards, Farrell said he is in no real rush to do a second season of the show, but that doesn’t mean that he isn’t open to the idea. “I don’t want it. I don’t not want it,” Farrell said. “We all left it in the ring in those eight hours. I would hate to, just because of a quote-unquote success, have to go again and for it to be a diluted version of what people seem to feel it is, majoritively. So I’m in no rush. I have no deep desire to do it. … Sure, if they think of something that works in conjunction as a parallel to Matt Reeves’ cinematic universe and it’s a good idea, I’m open it. But it’s not something concerning me.” Farrell’s comments echo those of filmmaker Matt Reeves, the director of The Batman and orchestrator of the ongoing universe that houses both Robert Pattinson’s Batman and Farrell’s Penguin, and DC Studios co-chiefs Peter Safran and James Gunn. “We don’t know. … There are a lot of moving pieces — probably most important Colin himself,” said Gunn in an interview with Variety this week. In an interview with Happy Sad Confused’s Josh Horowitz last month, Reeves confirmed that he, showrunner Lauren LeFranc, Farrell, and executive producer Dylan Clark are continuing to talk about continuing Oz’s story. “Obviously, we’re doing The Batman 2, we want to get the timing right on that,” Reeves said. “Our plan and our hope is to absolutely do another season, we just have to come up with the idea that we think is the right idea, which is what we’re working on.” The Penguin was a smash hit for Farrell, Warner Bros. Discovery, and all involved. The series earned critical praise, and was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, with Farrell winning Best Actor — Miniseries or Television Film for his portrayal of Oswald “Oz” Cobb.
