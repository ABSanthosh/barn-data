  "description": "\"I'm gonna get outta here, and when I do I'm gonna look after ya...\" Transmission Films has revealed the main official trailer for the film Spit – yes that's the actual title for it. David Wenham stars as infamous criminal John Francis \"Spit\" Spitieri in Jonathan Teplitzky's film Spit - debuting in Australia next March. In the sequel to the award-winning crime comedy, Gettin' Square, ex-junkie John Spitieri returns to Australia, only to find himself locked up in an Immigration Detention Centre with a massive target on his back, as old enemies come looking for him, determined to settle old scores. As Johnny talks up a storm without saying anything at all, he makes new friends amongst the detainees, and teaches them his version of mateship. The full cast also includes Helen Thomson, David Field, David Roberts, Gary Sweet, Arlo Green, Ayik Daniel Chut Deng, Sam \u0026 Teagan Rybka, \u0026 Sami Afuni. Not sure this will appeal to many outside of Australia, but it does look like a quirky, wonky, peculiar crime story similar to Trainspotting. Give it a look.

Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Jonathan Teplitzky's film Spit, direct from Transmission's YouTube: You can rewatch the teaser trailer for Jonathan Teplitzky's Spit film right here to catch the first look again. When ex-junkie Johnny \"Spit\" Spitieri flies into Australia on a bad passport, he's locked up in Immigration Detention Centre. The authorities want to know who he is and where he's been. So does gangster Chicka Martin, and his crooked cop mate, Arne Deviers, who are hot on Spit’s trail, and the Independent Public Integrity Commission is convinced the bumbling amnesiac is really an unlikely criminal mastermind. As Johnny talks up a storm without saying anything at all, he makes new friends amongst the detainees, and teaches them his version of mateship, and what it means to be truly Australian... Spit is directed by Oz writer / filmmaker Jonathan Teplitzky, director of the movies Better Than Sex, Gettin' Square, Burning Man, The Railway Man, and Churchill previously, plus many TV series episodes recently. The screenplay is written by Chris Nyst. Produced by Greg Duffy, Trish Lake, and David Wenham. Transmission Films will debut Teplitzky's Spit in Australian cinemas starting March 6th, 2025 next year.
