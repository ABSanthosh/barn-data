  "text": "Fox Television Stations CEO Jack Abernethy has sent a note to staffers addressing the Kanye West Yeezy.com advertisement that ran in three of its markets, including Los Angeles’ KTTV Fox 11, during the Super Bowl. The spot caused outrage as West has been regularly posting antisemitic messages on his social media while also proclaiming himself to be a nazi — and then began selling a t-shirt with a swastika on the website that had been advertised. “We regret that these commercials aired in these three markets, and we strongly condemn any form of antisemitism,” Abernethy wrote in his email to Fox TV Stations employees. As Variety reported on Monday, the 30-second spot, which was placed by the USIM media buying agency, didn’t set off red flags at the time it was submitted because it was prior to West’s recent outbursts — and the low-budget commercial, shot in what appeared to be a dentist’s chair as West said he was filming it on an iPhone, didn’t contain questionable content. Up until the ad actually ran, the Yeezy.com website featured a Shopify-powered store selection of various non-branded articles of clothing like shirts, pants and jackets — nothing that would have been deemed an issue.  But then, after the ad ran, Yeezy.com switched out its merchandise and put up just one item: A swastika T-shirt for sale, at $20 each. Popular on Variety “The ad, which was presented as a legitimate online apparel site before and during the airing of the Super Bowl, was switched at some point afterwards, and completely outside of our stations control, respondents to the commercials were redirected toward the marketing of a wholly appalling product,” Abernethy added in his note. On Tuesday, Shopify said the Yeezy shop had been pulled, adding that the website “did not engage in authentic commerce practices and violated our terms.” West’s X profile has been deactivated following days of the rapper posting antisemitic, misogynistic and pornographic posts. West declared “I’m a Nazi” and called Hitler “so fresh” days before his account shut down. His X posts were widely condemned by anti-hate organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee.  Here is Abernethy’s note to staff: To All FTS Employees: I wanted to take a moment to address a commercial that ran in three of our local television station markets during Super Bowl LIX on Fox. The ad, which was presented as a legitimate online apparel site before and during the airing of the Super Bowl, was switched at some point afterwards, and completely outside of our stations control respondents to the commercials were redirected toward the marketing of a wholly appalling product. We regret that these commercials aired in these three markets, and we strongly condemn any form of antisemitism. As you well know, Fox is a strong supporter of such organizations as the “Foundation to Combat Antisemitism,” the “United Jewish Appeal Federation,” and others through direct support or on-air promotion of their campaigns and we will continue to work with them in combating antisemitism.
