Because the crew was our extended family, and we’re still really close with them, and that was really moving to see.” Nuñez also appeared in the segment and teased his inclusion in the new spinoff. The actor will be reprising his role as Oscar Martinez in Peacock’s followup series, which is rumored to be titled “The Paper.” The story follows staffers at a dying Midwestern newspaper whose publisher is trying to revive it with volunteer reporters. The series comes from Daniels and is executive produced by Michael Koman (“Nathan For You”). No premiere date has been set. Popular on Variety “They’re still editing and stuff. More will be revealed!” Nuñez told “Today.” “It’s exciting. The experience we went through — not everyone gets to do it.” Kinsey and Nuñez joined “Today” alongside Leslie David Baker, Brian Baumgartner, Creed Bratton, Kate Flannery and Ellie Kemper. Previously announced cast members for the new “Office” follow-up series include Domhnall Gleeson, Sabrina Impacciatore, Chelsea Frei, Melvin Gregg, Gbemisola Ikumelo, Alex Edelman, Ramona Young and Tim Key. It will retain the same mockumentary style, with the show’s in-universe documentary crew that filmed the Dunder Mifflin’s Scranton branch in “The Office” now filming in a new location. Kinsey and Fischer have hosted the “Office Ladies” podcast for more than five years, recapping all nine seasons of the NBC sitcom.",
