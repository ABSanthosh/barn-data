  "description": "\"A return to the golden age of samurai cinema.\" Well Go USA has revealed an official trailer for 11 Rebels, an action movie set in feudal Japan made by veteran action filmmaker Kazuya Shiraishi. After premiering last year at the Tokyo Film Festival and opening Japan last fall, Well Go will release 11 Rebels on VOD in the US starting in June this summer. Shiraishi Kazuya directs this action epic where a group of small town cons are drafted to defend a fortress from government forces. Amidst the Boshin War's brutal conflicts, a motley squad of criminals and samurai undertakes a desperate defense – their stand triggered by clashing interests of the Shibata clan, the shogunate, and the new government. When the officials who offered them freedom back off their promise, the rebels must fend for themselves. Starring Takayuki Yamada, Taiga Nakano, Riho Sayashi, Ukon Onoe, Takara Sakumoto, and Seiji Chihara. Holy hell - this looks pretty badass! Brutal and epic and intense throughout - tons of fights galore. I hope the 11 bring them down! Worth a look. Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Kazuya Shiraishi's action film 11 Rebels, direct from YouTube: In Kazuya Shiraishi’s action-packed […]",
