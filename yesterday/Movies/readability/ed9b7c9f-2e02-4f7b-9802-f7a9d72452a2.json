Lionsgate has marched out the second trailer for The Long Walk, an extremely intense new thriller from filmmakers Francis Lawrence \u0026 JT Mollner about a dystopian America. Based on storyteller Stephen King’s first-written novel, and Francis Lawrence, director of The Hunger Games films, comes this grueling story of boys out on a never-ending walk. In the near future, where America has become a police state, one hundred boys are selected to enter an annual contest where the winner will be awarded whatever he wants for the rest of his life. The brutal game is simple - maintain a steady walking pace of three miles per hour without stopping. Three warnings, and you're out – forever. It's win or die, on this walk. Starring Cooper Hoffman (from Licorice Pizza, Saturday Night) + David Jonsson (from Alien: Romulus), Garrett Wareing, Tut Nyuot, Charlie Plummer, Ben Wang, Roman Griffin Davis, Jordan Gonzalez, Joshua Odjick, Josh Hamilton, with Judy Greer, and Mark Hamill.
