  "text": "CBS News’ 60 Minutes ended this evening with a segment on the surprise departure of executive producer Bill Owens, a move that has drawn a great deal of consternation in the news division over what’s ahead with parent company Paramount Global‘s efforts to merge with Skydance. “Stories we pursued for 57 years are often controversial — lately the Israel-Gaza war and the Trump administration,” correspondent Scott Pelley told viewers. “Bill made sure they were accurate and fair. He was tough that way, but our parent company Paramount is trying to complete a merger. The Trump administration must approve it. Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways. None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he had lost the independence that honest journalism requires.” Pelley added, “No one here is happy about it, but in resigning, Bill proved one thing: he was the right person to lead 60 Minutes all along.” Watch on Deadline Owens announced his exit last week, telling staffers that he lost the ability to make “independent decisions” about the show. In January, CBS News tapped Susan Zirinsky, the former president of its news division, to review news standards. Per The New York Times, that followed complaints from Paramount Global’s controlling shareholder Shari Redstone over a 60 Minutes segment on the war between Israel and Hamas. But as Pelley noted, Paramount Global is seeking regulatory approval of its merger with Skydance. It has landed at the same time that Trump is pressing a $20 billion lawsuit against the network for the way that 60 Minutes edited an interview with Kamala Harris. Although many legal observers see the lawsuit as frivolous, CBS and Trump’s team have hired a mediator in advance of a potential settlement, a that would be widely viewed as caving to the president’s demands in an effort to secure a merger greenlight. Trump has said that he is asking for “a lot” to settle the lawsuit. 60 Minutes has continued to feature hard hitting segments on the Trump administration, including a piece this evening that focused on the public health implications of the drastic cuts to the National Institutes of Health. In the final segment of the show, Pelley suggested that Owens’ resignation was meant to send a message about corporate interference in one of the network’s top shows and the crown jewel of television news magazines. Per the Times, Owens told staffers that altering the show’s independence was a “slippery slope.” “Bill resigned Tuesday,” Pelley said. “It was hard on him and hard on us, but he did it for us and you.” More to come.",
