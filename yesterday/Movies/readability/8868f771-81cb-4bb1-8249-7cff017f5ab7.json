  "text": "Following the heartbreaking news of Liam Payne’s recent death, devastated fans are now reflecting on the events that preceded the tragedy. A key focus has been the former One Direction member’s abrupt departure from Universal Music Group, just days before his passing. Here’s a closer look at why fans believe Liam Payne parted ways with the record label in the days leading up to his death. Liam Payne was reportedly dropped from his record label days before death Universal Music Group reportedly dropped Liam Payne just days before his tragic death. Multiple sources claimed that the singer’s solo career had been struggling, leading to the label parting ways with him. (via Daily Mail) Moreover, delays in releasing his second album and his failure to recoup the advance supposedly influenced the label’s decision to drop him. Capitol Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group, signed Payne in 2016 when he began his solo career after One Direction’s hiatus. Payne also saw early success with hits like “Strip That Down.” However, he reportedly struggled to maintain momentum, compared to other former bandmates like Harry Styles and Zayn Malik. This decline in success ultimately led to Universal’s decision to drop the “For You” singer from their roster. Albeit, the record label hasn’t given an official statement regarding Payne’s departure as of writing. The news of Liam Payne’s departure from Universal Music came just before his tragic death after a fall from a third-story hotel balcony in Buenos Aires. Payne had been acting erratically in the hours before his death, with reports of drug and alcohol use. His PR agent had also resigned earlier in October, leaving him without representation in the final days of his life. (via Sky News) Meanwhile, neither Universal Music Group nor Liam Payne’s representatives have commented on the matter. However, the record label honored the singer after his death, expressing devastation and offering condolences to his family. The beloved singer’s legacy continues through his music and the countless fans he inspired worldwide. Payne’s influence remains strong, even after his passing.",
