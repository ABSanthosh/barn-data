  "description": "A BREED APART - Heavy on the Laughs, Light on the Scares - McEric reviews the new horror/comedy from the Furst Brothers starring Grace Caroline Currey and Page Kennedy. Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a review of the Furst Brothers' new horror/comedy A BREED APART, out now in theaters and on-demand. The film follows several Internet celebrities who are invited to an island overrun by rabid dogs to compete for a prize... survival. Check out the trailer: The film stars Grace Caroline Currey (SHAZAM: FURY OF THE GODS, FALL), Virginia Gardner (FALL, 2018's HALLOWEEN), Page Kennedy (THE MEG, THE MEG 2), Troy Gentile (ABC's \"The Goldbergs\"), Riele Downs (Nickelodeon's \"Henry Danger\"), Zak Steiner (Netflix's \"Jessica Jones\"),and Hayden Panittiere (NBC's \"Heroes\"). The film is directed by Griff Furst and brother Nathan Furst, whose previous collaboration as co-directors brought us NIGHTMARE SHARK. Solo, Griff Furst has directed such films as SWAMP SHARK, GHOST SHARK, and TRAILER PARK SHARK, so he clearly knows his way around a creature feature... even if he doesn't really want to. \"Who is Louie Myman?\" I asked when we spoke this past Friday. [Louie Myman is the credited director of Furst's films 100 MILLION BC and ALLIGATOR ALLEY.) \"Oh, Louie Myman! Do you know Alan Smithee?\" \"Yes.\" \"He's Alan Smithee's brother. Yeah, I mean, it's a tough thing. It's an interesting thing to explore. It's like when you do a creature feature and it rates well, and it does well, they just offer you more of them. And I love them, don't get me wrong. I grew up watching all these creature features - Mysterious Island and Jaws and Cujo. I love those movies, but I love ALL kinds of movies. The creature feature, itself, Finish the article on AICN",

  "text": "Published at: May 17, 2025, 9:41 a.m. CST by Barbarella Hey friends! Barbarella here back from hiatus, and I’m delighted to share my thoughts on A24’s newest release, Friendship, which is out NOW! Sometimes people watch trailers and think, “Oh this movie is like [insert movie about a similar topic].” If you’re thinking that about Friendship, it’s not. Genuinely funny without being cruel, Andrew DeYoung’s exploration of adult male friendship proves charming and elicits more than a few hearty laughs from me.  In an era where seemingly fewer friendships exist in the real world than online, making new friends may be challenging, particularly for adult men. Keeping them may be nearly impossible.  When Craig (Tim Robinson) receives a misdelivered package intended for cool new neighbor Austin (Paul Rudd), Craig walks it over to him. Upon meeting the charismatic and friendly guy, he quickly gets invited in and finds himself actually making friends. His expressions reveal his delight in this newly formed camaraderie with someone who is just so darned interesting. One can’t help but feel happy for his new accomplishment.   Sadly, new friendships are fragile, and in a group setting, Craig doesn’t make the best impression on the guys. It doesn’t take long before Austin begins distancing himself from the awkward neighbor. In his desperation to rekindle the closeness they once shared, Craig makes some questionable decisions that lead to more awkward situations and laughs. On the surface, this is a quirky comedy that relies heavily on Tim Robinson’s performance. However, there is much more to this movie. Throughout, it addresses many common insecurities that men face in their lives. Yet, it avoids approaching them in the usual, clichéd ways. Instead, it views them from a different perspective, and it does so without criticism and judgment. I find it refreshing to watch a story of a man facing his insecurities, and for that portrayal to not feel particularly condescending. At a time when the notion of toxic masculinity tends to maneuver its way into everything, Friendship avoids it, choosing to allow the lead men to be vulnerable and human.  Casting director Melissa DeLizia brings to the table the perfect people to represent the main characters. Paul Rudd, often considered the most likeable guy in Hollywood, oozes charm and appeal, making him the ideal neighbor with whom any middle-aged man would want to befriend. Yet, it’s Tim Robinson’s embodiment of Craig that carries Friendship. I could not imagine anyone navigating the line between awkward and normal the way he does. At times, I find humor in just his expressions.  In addition to the leads, supporting cast members Kate Mara and Jack Dylan Grazer, who play Craig’s wife and son, respectively, win me over. While she represents a trope in a lot of ways, her relationship with her son side-steps what I would have expected, and I find that hilarious.  Overall, Friendship is a nice departure from the typical male-bonding, bromance type films. It’s fresh and hilarious, and we could use more of this kind of approach to masculinity in movies. If you need a good laugh, it's in theaters now! Check out the Trailer.",
