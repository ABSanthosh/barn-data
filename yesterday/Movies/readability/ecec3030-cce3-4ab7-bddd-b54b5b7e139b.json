  "text": "Tyler, the Creator has secured his third No. 1 album with “Chromakopia,” which bows atop the Billboard 200 after only four days of sales in the tracking week. The rapper, who announced the album on Oct. 17 and dropped it on Oct. 28, scored 299,500 equivalent album units with his eighth studio record. “Chromakopia” arrived during the off-cycle for typical album releases, skirting a Friday street date in favor of a Monday one. Despite the truncated tracking week, he earned his biggest streaming and largest sales weeks ever, and would have debuted atop the chart based solely on streams. On a more nuanced scale, “Chromakopia” had 157,000 streaming equivalent album units, as well as 142,000 in album sales and 500 units in track-equivalent albums. He moved 66,000 in vinyl sales, his biggest first week in vinyl and the third highest-selling debut week for any rap vinyl album since 1991. Album sales got a boost from the six deluxe CD box sets and vinyls. Popular on Variety Coming in behind “Chromakopia” is Halsey’s “The Great Impersonator,” which bows at No. 2 as her fifth album to debut in the top two. That album had 93,000 equivalent album units earned, split between 81,000 in album sales and 12,000 in streaming-equivalent album units. On vinyl, Halsey had her best-ever week in the format with 26,000 copies sold. Elsewhere on the tally, Sabrina Carpenter’s “Short n’ Sweet” slides from No. 2 to 3, followed by Kelsea Ballerini’s “Patterns” and Rod Wave’s “Last Lap.” Eminem’s “The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce)” surges from No. 44 to 6, coming in ahead of Gracie Abrams’ “The Secret of Us,” Morgan Wallen’s “One Thing at a Time,” Billie Eilish’s “Hit Me Hard and Soft” and GloRilla’s “Glorious.”",
