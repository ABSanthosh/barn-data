Recently he made Memory with Jessica Chastain and now he's back with another new project with her. Dreams premiered at the 2025 Berlin Film Festival and is next playing at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival now in Czechia, which is where this trailer is from - though it's entirely with English dialogue. Fernando, a young ballet dancer from Mexico, dreams of international fame. Believing his lover Jennifer, a wealthy socialite \u0026 philanthropist, will support him, he leaves everything behind \u0026 narrowly escapes death while crossing the border.

Luckily I've already seen the film (at Berlinale) and it's quite good, definitely stirs up strong feelings in everyone. Franco is making a strong point here and I respect him for what he's saying with Dreams. Still no US release set yet – hopefully soon. Here's the first look international trailer for Michel Franco's film Dreams, direct from YouTube: In the romantic drama Dreams from Mexican writer / director Michel Franco, we follow Fernando (Isaac Hernández), a young Mexican ballet dancer who longs for international recognition and to build a new life abroad. He decides to immigrate to the USA, hoping to be supported by his girlfriend Jennifer (Jessica Chastain), an upper-class philanthropist. However, as it soon turns out, crossing the guarded border will be far from the most complicated part of his plans. His arrival in her city, however, disrupts Jennifer's carefully curated world. Dreams is written and directed by acclaimed Mexican filmmaker Michel Franco, director of Daniel and Ana, After Lucia, A los ojos, Chronic, April's Daughter, New Order, Sundown, and Memory previously. It's produced by Michel Franco, Eréndira Núñez Larios, Alexander Rodnyansky. This initially premiered at the 2025 Berlin Film Festival earlier this year in the Main Competition. It's currently set to open in Mexico starting in October this fall. No US release date has been set yet. Anyone interested? Find more posts in: Indies, To Watch, Trailer",
