Here's the second trailer (+ poster) for Dan Trachtenberg's Predator: Killer of Killers, from YouTube: You can rewatch the first trailer for Predator: Killer of Killers animated movie right here for more footage.

But while all these warriors are killers in their own right, they are merely prey for their new opponent–the ultimate killer of killers.
