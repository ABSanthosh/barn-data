This certainly looks like a zeitgeist thriller – not only about the age of misinformation we're in now, but also criticism of America's response to 9/11 and many bad things they did. Here's the first teaser trailer for Netflix's conspiracy thriller series Zero Day, direct from YouTube: Netflix's Zero Day is a limited thriller series starring Robert De Niro as respected former U.S. President George Mullen, who, as head of the Zero Day Commission, is charged with finding the perpetrators of a devastating cyber attack that has caused chaos around the country and many fatalities. As disinformation runs rampant and the personal ambition of power brokers in technology, Wall Street, and government collide, Mullen’s unwavering search for the truth forces him to confront his own dark secrets while risking all he holds dear. Zero Day is a series created and written and showrun by the two writers Eric Newman (writer on \"Griselda\", \"True Story\", \"Narcos: Mexico\") and Noah Oppenheim (president of NBC News; writer of The Maze Runner, Allegiant, Jackie). With additional writing by Michael S. Schmid and Roberto Patino. Featuring episodes directed by Lesli Linka Glatter (director of eps of \"The Newsroom\", \"Homeland\", \"Love \u0026 Death\"). Exec produced by Michael S. Schmidt, Lesli Linka Glatter, Jonathan Glickman, Robert De Niro, creators Eric Newman \u0026 Noah Oppenheim. Netflix will debut the Zero Day series streaming on Netflix worldwide starting February 20th, 2025 early in the New Year. First impression? Who wants to watch?
