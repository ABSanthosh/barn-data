Getty After he was accused of rape in April, Shannon Sharpe has reportedly settled the Jane Doe’s civil lawsuit on undisclosed terms. The accuser’s attorney Tony Buzbee announced Friday that the lawsuit will be dismissed now that they have “reached a mutually agreed upon resolution” with the 3x Super Bowl champion and sportscaster. “On April 20, 2025, The Buzbee Law Firm filed a complaint in Nevada making several allegations against Shannon Sharpe on behalf of our client,” wrote Buzbee on X. “Both sides acknowledge a long-term consensual and tumultuous relationship. After protracted and respectful negotiations, I’m pleased to announce that we have reached a mutually agreed upon resolution. All matters have now been addressed satisfactorily, and the matter is closed. The lawsuit will thus be dismissed with prejudice.” Following the April lawsuit, Sharpe denied the allegations and asserted that incidents of rape, choking and more in the 13-page civil suit are being taken out of context and were consensual. His attorney called the complaint a “blatant and cynical attempt to shake down Mr. Sharpe for millions of dollars.
