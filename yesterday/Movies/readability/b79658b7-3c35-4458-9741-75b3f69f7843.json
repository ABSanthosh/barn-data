The minute I see there’s confidence in somebody, I’m like ‘Oh, that one’s gonna go far.’”  Season 17 winner Onya Nurve agrees that confidence and having faith in herself was the key to her win. “Everyone knows ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ was a dream of mine and that it’s something I wanted to accomplish when I started drag four years ago,” Nurve said.  Gonzalo Marroquin, Getty Images for MTV “Me getting on the show is a testament to continuing to follow your dreams, never saying no to yourself, always betting on yourself, and always listening to your intuition. I hope me winning this show is a beacon of hope for every entertainer that looks just like me.”  Nerve’s father, alongside the parents of the other contestants, appeared on “Drag Race” to take part in a special makeover episode, walking the runway with their children. Finalist Jewels Sparkles recalled her father’s enthusiasm towards getting in drag for the show.  “My dad is a straight Latino man,” Sparkles said. “They called him to come cross-dress on national television for his son, and he said ‘Absolutely I’ll be there.’ My mom was helping him practice walking in heels, he was practicing his runway walk, his entrance line, he was so excited about it. Popular on Variety Gonzalo Marroquin, Getty Images for MTV “That is a real man,” she continued. “He said ‘Yes, I’m going to support my kid 100%.’ Both of our [Onya and Jewels’] parents are people of color who went on that show. If they can do that, if they can cross-dress on national TV, the minimum you can do is accept your kid.”  Another season 17 cast member whose parental relationships are important to their drag is Lana Ja’Rae, who cites her mother as one of the inspirations behind her style.  “I pull from things that make me happy, things in my life that bring me joy,” Ja’Rae explained. “I want my drag to make people smile, because that’s the best gift to have in this world, to make people smile. My inspirations are my mom, the cartoons I watched growing up and black supermodels of the 90s like Naomi Campbell.”  “Everything people told me I couldn’t be as a child growing up, all of those negative words personified, is what Lana Ja’Rae is. I hope that inspires people to embrace the negativity and transform it into positivity.”  Where Ja’Rae takes inspiration from the women in her life, fellow competitor Suzie Toot cites some of Broadway’s most famous starlets as creative influences.  LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA – JUNE 06:Jamal Sims, Michelle Visage and Randy Barbato during the RuPaul’s Drag Race Official FYC Event at Skybar in the Mondrian Los Angeles on June 06, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.

That’s the biggest driver of Suzie Toot and who she is.”",
