  "text": "Golden (fka Atlantis), Michel Gondry‘s movie musical on the childhood of musician Pharrell Williams, has been scrapped in post-production, Deadline has confirmed. Previously dated for a wide theatrical release on May 5, the film will never see the light of day, as it’s not being shopped. In a statement shared with Deadline, Gondry and Williams attributed the decision to axe the project to their inability to fulfill the vision with which they had set out. “When all of us got into the editing room we collectively decided there wasn’t a path forward to tell the version of this story that we originally envisioned,” they said. “We appreciate all the hard work of the talented cast and crew. While we’re disappointed we can’t deliver this film, we have incredible partners at Universal and will collaborate in a different capacity again soon.” Kelvin Harrison Jr. was set to topline Golden, which took its original title from the Virginia Beach apartment complex where Williams grew up. Others in the cast included recent Oscar winner Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Brian Tyree Henry, Halle Bailey, Janelle Monáe, Missy Elliott, Quinta Brunson, Anderson .Paak and Jaboukie Young-White. Watch on Deadline Gil Netter joined Williams and his partner Mimi Valdes in producing. Universal had no comment on the fate of the film. Should it have made it to theaters, Golden would have been the second feature examination of Williams’ life to come out within two years. Universal’s specialty label, Focus Features, last fall unveiled Piece by Piece, a doc on the artist told with Legos, from director Morgan Neville, which grossed over $10 million. In an interview with Empire magazine published last fall, Williams called Golden “a coming-of-age story about self-discovery and pursuing your dreams,” before adding that the project was “so much more magical than that. It’s a celebration of Black life, Black culture, and most importantly, Black joy.” It’s not presently clear what’s up next for Williams, who recently contributed music to Tyler Perry’s Netflix pic The Six Triple Eight. Known for films like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Science of Sleep, as well as the Jim Carrey series Kidding, Gondry is set to premiere his animated feature Maya, Give Me a Title at this year’s Berlin Film Festival. Variety was first to the news on Golden.",
