  "text": "Dr. Heavenly Kimes is a woman of many talents. She practices dentistry at her own establishment and stars on Bravo‘s Married to Medicine. Kimes is one of the most recognizable personalities of the long-running reality series, wrapping Season 11 in the coming weeks. “We’re definitely grateful and humbled that so many people are still interested in us and we have so much more to give,” Kimes told Deadline during an interview. “But we’re just humble that people want to see our lives because it is a little bit different for us. It is a little bit different than other reality TV shows.” About how she balances her dental practice and the gruesome schedule of filming a reality TV show, Kimes said, “I think I’m probably the most balanced person on our show, because I do have a job. I do work in my profession, but I do it three days a week, so the other four days of the week, I’m either spending time it with my kids or doing something else.” Watch on Deadline “Bravo and Purveyors of Pop have been very, very good about working around our schedules, so it just all flows together,” she added. “But at the end of the day, it’s about priorities.” Since Kimes is one of the most outspoken personalities on Married to Medicine and can call people out without problem, many have suggested she join Peacock’s The Traitors, which she says would be game for. “I’ve never watched the whole thing, but I’ve seen some clips and it seems like a very interesting dynamic where they’re bringing people from different places and playing a game,” she told us. “I like to play games. I think I’m very good at games. I’m very smart. Phaedra is smart too, but not quite as smart as I am.” She continued, “Everybody keeps asking me about The Traitors. I don’t know why. Even when I did my last thing at Bravo, they voted me most likely to win at Traitors. I never really thought about about it, but I’m down for any opportunity. I like to play games. If you want to start a campaign, let’s do it.” One of the most wholesome aspects of Kimes on Married to Medicine is her scenes with her daughter Alaura Kimes. Earlier this year, Alaura shared a video on social media with her Bravoleb mother, receiving positive reactions from fans. “I didn’t realize how much we were alike until that video,” Kimes said. “I was looking at it like, ‘She does have mannerisms like me!’ I use slang and Ebonics, but it’s kind of become a habit, so I use words that she’s actually picked up [from me]. And to me, it’s hilarious, but we do have a great time together.” Alaura is one of the few people that is able to call Kimes out and not get flack on-screen, with the Married to Medicine star saying, “She’s like her mother. Yes, she is that way, and I appreciate that. I like straightforwardness. If somebody has a problem, I’d rather them say it. Let’s talk about it however it comes out, and let’s move forward. I just don’t like people to get stuck, like some of [my cast members] are stuck. We have to learn to move forward.” As far as her future on Married to Medicine, Kimes said, “I can see some more seasons. As long as they want me, imma be there.” “I think it’s a great opportunity. I think I have so much more to give,” she added. “My daughter’s at a different peak in her life. We got some more seasons in us. I feel good, I look great. As an empty nester and my daughter moving back to Atlanta, I’m just excited about life right now.”",
