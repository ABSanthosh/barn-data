  "description": "\"I don't want to be your friend, you old trout!\" New Mountain Films has unveiled an official trailer for an indie comedy film titled Loathe Thy Neighbor, formerly known as Yuppie. This Canadian dark comedy is directed by Sergio Navarretta, and will be out later this summer. When a neurotic city transplant inherits his late father's rural farm, he must survive his unhinged neighbor's psychological warfare while discovering that sometimes your worst enemy might just save your life. He gets caught up in a standoff with his cranky neighbour, played by Lauren Holly in a role that's deliciously deadpan and totally unhinged. Described as a \"twisted rural comedy about finding your roots and discovering that the person driving you crazy might be exactly what you need to finally grow up.\" With Lauren Holly \u0026 Brennan Clost, with Shaun Benson, Brittany Raymond, Paloma Nuñez, Jessica Greco, \u0026 Luke Humphrey. Looks like zany, absurd fun. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Sergio Navarretta's film Loathe Thy Neighbor, from YouTube: Will Larkfield (Brennan Clost), a neurotic city guy with countless allergies, inherits his late father's rural farmhouse and meets his nightmare neighbor Wanda Bellerose (Lauren Holly) - a volatile honey farmer who […]",

The screenplay is written by Christian Majewski. It's produced by Brennan Clost, Rebeka Herron, Lauren Holly, \u0026 Christian Majewski.
