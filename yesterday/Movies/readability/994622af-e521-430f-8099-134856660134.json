Defend Rohan! \"An All New Story\" featurette for The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, from YouTube: You can watch the first official trailer for LOTR: The War of the Rohirrim right here for even more footage. Set 183 years before the events chronicled in the original trilogy of films, The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim tells the fate of the House of Helm Hammerhand, the legendary King of Rohan. A sudden attack by Wulf, a clever and ruthless Dunlending lord seeking vengeance for the death of his father, forces Helm and his people to make a daring last stand in the ancient stronghold of the Hornburg— a mighty fortress that will later come to be known as Helm’s Deep. Finding herself in an increasingly desperate situation, Héra, the daughter of Helm, must now summon the will to lead the resistance against a deadly enemy intent on their total destruction. LOTR: The War of the Rohirrim is directed by acclaimed Japanese animation filmmaker Kenji Kamiyama, director on Mini Pato, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Eden of the East, 009 Re:Cyborg, \"Ultraman\", Blade Runner: Black Lotus, and \"The Ninth Jedi\" segment of Star Wars: Visions previously. The screenplay is by Jeffrey Addiss \u0026 Will Matthews and Phoebe Gittins \u0026 Arty Papageorgiou; from a story by Jeffrey Addiss \u0026 Will Matthews and Boyens. Based on the beloved J.R.R. Tolkien books \u0026 characters of Middle Earth. Produced by Oscar winner Philippa Boyens and Jason DeMarco and Joseph Chou (of Blade Runner: Black Lotus). Warner Bros will debut The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim in theaters worldwide starting December 13th, 2024 at the end of the year. Who's down?
