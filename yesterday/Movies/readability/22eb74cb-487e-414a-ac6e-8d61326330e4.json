  "text": "Howie Mandel has apologized to Bill Burr after forcing an awkward interaction between the comedian and Smashing Pumpkins guitarist Billy Corgan on his “Howie Mandel Does Stuff” podcast. “I want to apologize,” Mandel said on a recent “Does Stuff” episode. “I feel horrible, and I’m sorry, Bill. I’m sorry, Billy. I only tried to do something good.” “I legitimately thought I was doing something nice, I swear to you. I thought it was funny,” he continued. “Bill Burr said I’m a ‘Hollywood whore.’ I should be proud of that? I’m not. The truth of the matter is, if he feels bad, I feel bad.” While hosting Burr on his podcast in January, Mandel brought Corgan as a surprise guest. In a November appearance on the “Does Stuff” podcast, Corgan recalled his stepmom asking him about Burr, adding he “might be one of the children that your father sired in his days being a traveling musician.” Popular on Variety After the surprise reunion, Burr said on “The Rich Eisen Show” that he doesn’t “like talking about” his private life. He went on to say, “Howie did what he did because he is a Hollywood whore and he doesn’t care what happens. He could’ve said something and he just brings up all that weirdness.” During Burr’s “Does Stuff” interview, he said of Mandel surprising him with Corgan, “That’s the thing, he’s bringing [Corgan and I] in here not because he’s trying to heal the bullshit that we went through growing up. He’s getting [us] here just for the fucking ratings.”",
