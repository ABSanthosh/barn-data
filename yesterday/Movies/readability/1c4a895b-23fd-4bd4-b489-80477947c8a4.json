  "description": "\"You feel better now. But tomorrow you're gonna feel bad again.\" Oscilloscope Labs has revealed the full official trailer for a peculiar indie film titled Vulcanizadora, which will be out in select theaters this May. The film originally premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival last year (here's the fest teaser) and played at tons of other fests. Vulcanizadora is the new film from filmmaker Joel Potrykus, behind such peculiar, unsettling cult classics as Ape, Buzzard, and The Alchemist Cookbook previously. This is his latest \"what am I watching?!\" feature, the first since Relaxer in 2018. Two friends trudge through a Michigan forest with the intention of following through on a disturbing pact. Once their plan goes shockingly awry, the surreal and haunting consequences of their failure can't stay hidden for long. Starring Joel Potrykus, Joshua Burge, Bill Vincent, and Solo Potrykus. Reviews describe it as: \"A darkly funny heavy metal comedy that deftly shifts into a poignant existential drama.\" Still don't really know whats going on in this - check it out anyway. Here's the full official trailer (+ poster) for Joel Potrykus' film Vulcanizadora, direct from YouTube: \"To me, Vulcanizadora is my most personal and my bleakest work. […]",

Here's the full official trailer (+ poster) for Joel Potrykus' film Vulcanizadora, direct from YouTube: \"To me, Vulcanizadora is my most personal and my bleakest work. It has a weird tone that I've been trying to hit for a long time. It's always great working with Joshua, and he completely understands the challenge of what we're all doing, which should be sad, funny, and scary —oftentimes hitting all three in the same scene. Sad, funny, scary. We kept reminding ourselves of that on set, and thinking about how the audience would be kept off balance. Ideally, half the audience is laughing, half are grimacing in confusion. There are a lot of ideas and fears that I'm putting out there. Fatherhood opened up all kinds of beautiful new feelings for me, but has also me seeing humanity in a much different way. Both lead characters are voicing some of my darkest thoughts, and I'm not even sure I'm completely comfortable with talking about any of it yet.\" –Director Joel Potrykus (via Indiewire) You can rewatch the teaser trailer for Joel Potrykus' Vulcanizadora right here, for the first look again. Intro from Tribeca: \"In this intense tale from provocateur Joel Potrykus, two friends (Potrykus and Joshua Burge), embark on a disturbing mission in the Michigan woods. As they trudge through the forest, their intentions become increasingly clear. When their plan ultimately unravels, one of the friends must return home to face the surreal, unsettling consequences of their actions, grappling with the legal and emotional repercussions that follow.\" Vulcanizadora is both written and directed by American indie filmmaker Joel Potrykus, director of the films Ape, Buzzard, The Alchemist Cookbook, and Relaxer previously, plus many other shorts. Produced by Ashley Potrykus, Hannah Dweck, Matt Grady, Theodore Schaefer. This initially premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival last year. Oscilloscope Labs will debut Potrykus' Vulcanizadora in select US theaters starting May 2nd, 2025 coming soon. For more info, visit the official site. Intrigued?
