  "description": "\"That old park – it's actually real!\" Yes it is – it really did exist. Another trailer has launched for the super crazy indie horror thriller film called Traction Park Massacre, a theme park horror riff from filmmakers Douglas DiMonda \u0026 Adam Dubin. This new trailer is also a promo to reveal they'll have a panel at Florida Supercon convention - on July 19th. We also posted the first official trailer last year for this wacky horror mash-up, which still doesn't have a final release date set yet. \"Young People meet Outlaw Bikers meet feral Twin Psycho-killers in a notorious abandoned water park.\" Terror Twins LLC is making the film, which is described as an homage to horror cult classics like Evil Dead 2, Friday the 13th, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, etc. Also inspired by the infamous Action Park water park in New Jersey (profiled in this doc Class Action Park) that was actually very dangerous. Traction Park Massacre stars Kai Thomas Schulz, Bodhi Schulz, Helene Henry, and others. The soundtrack features classic metal tracks, a score by Testament's Alex Skolnick, and a theme song \"Traction Park Massacre (Don't Cry For Me)\" from Das Moöse. Watch out. Here's the […]",

Here's the second official trailer for DiMonda \u0026 Dubin's Traction Park Massacre, direct from YouTube: You can rewatch the first 2024 trailer for DiMonda \u0026 Dubin's Traction Park Massacre right here for more. Gnarly horror film Traction Park Massacre is an audacious joy ride that brings together two groups of strong characters isolated in an abandoned amusement park called Action Wonerland which is now at the mercy of the Terror Twins, played by brothers Kai Thomas Schulz \u0026 Bodhi Schulz. The fictional park in the film is a dangerous local amusement park that burned to the ground 15 years earlier, supposedly killing then 10-year-old twins Otto and Emil Von Metzger, giving rise to urban legends. But the Terror Twins are alive \u0026 they hunt those thrill seekers foolish enough to attempt to find the remains of the abandoned park. Traction Park Massacre is co-written \u0026 co-directed by indie genre filmmakers Douglas DiMonda and Adam Dubin (director of Murder in the Front Row: The San Francisco Bay Area Thrash Metal Story), making their first feature film together. Produced by Jack Gulick. This hasn't premiered at any festivals or elsewhere yet - stay tuned for updates. Expected to arrive in theaters late 2025. Still waiting to watch this?
