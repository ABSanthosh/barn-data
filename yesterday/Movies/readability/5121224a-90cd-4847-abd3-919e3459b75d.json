  "text": "Not to point fingers, but Ella Purnell has an issue with one of her biggest roles yet. The Fallout star recently shared her annoyances over working with a fake amputated finger as post-apocalyptic heroine Lucy MacLean on the Prime Video series, admitting she hopes not to get typecast after her Arcane animated character Jinx also lost a digit. “That would be one of the worst things to happen to me,” said Purnell at Fan Expo HQ. “Purely because, do you have any idea how annoying it is to have that finger painted on me every single day? This finger is the bane of my life. It is the worst thing.” Watch on Deadline In Season 1 of the video game series adaptation Fallout, Lucy loses her finger in a gruesome encounter with The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) before getting it replaced with a prosthetic from robot Mister Handy. “They paint it, but this is the finger—I don’t know if you guys know this—that you use the most, for everything all the time,” added Purnell, holding up her right index finger. “Then you have to take it off, put it back on, it’s very annoying. I just have this ‘poop finger’ all the time. “I go to Whole Foods and I’m picking up the vegetables, and people are looking at me like ‘Stop touching the vegetables with your poop finger.’ It’s just terrible,” she vented. The actress credited makeup department head Michael Harvey for dubbing it the “poop finger,” noting the name “caught like wildfire” on set. Season 2 of Fallout, which is expected to premiere in early 2026, began production last month in Santa Clarita following a delay amid the Los Angeles County wildfires.",
