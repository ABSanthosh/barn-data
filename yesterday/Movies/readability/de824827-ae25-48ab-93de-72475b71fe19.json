  "text": "A new report on the upcoming Resident Evil movie from Zach Cregger opens up more of what fans can expect from the new film. What are the new Resident Evil movie plot details? According to a new report from Daniel Richtman (also known as DanielRPK) on social media, Austin Abrams will be playing an original character in the upcoming movie. His character, Brian, is said to have no ties to the game, with Richtman also noting that the film is not going to be a “faithful adaptation of the games.” Cregger’s Resident Evil reboot will be released in United States theaters on September 18, 2026. Currently, not a whole lot is known about what Cregger’s Resident Evil movie will focus on, especially if the movie is going to be a wholly original story set in the Resident Evil universe. The new Resident Evil movie will be directed by Cregger, who co-wrote the screenplay with Army of the Dead and John Wick: Chapter 4 scribe Shay Hatten. At the moment, Euphoria star Austin Abrams is the only confirmed cast member for the project. However, it was recently revealed that Oscar winner Mikey Madison was reportedly in negotiations for the lead role. Both Madison and Abrams aren’t strangers to the horror genre, after respectively starring in 2022’s Scream and 2019’s Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. The legendary video game franchise has been no stranger to movie adaptations, though, with seven different films having been made dating back to 2002, most of which have starred Milla Jovovich. Cregger is best known for his work as one of the founding members of the comedy troupe The Whitest Kids U’ Know, which he founded alongside Sam Brown and the late Trevor Moore. Cregger also directed the 2009 comedy Miss March but broke out as a director following the 2022 horror film Barbarian, which became a massive success and garnered positive praise from the horror community.",
