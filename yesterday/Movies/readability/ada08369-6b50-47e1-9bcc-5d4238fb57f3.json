  "description": "\"What happened to my sweet girl?\" \"She's gone!\" Searchlight Pictures has debuted a brand new trailer for Darren Aronofsky's Oscar-winning thriller Black Swan, which originally opened in 2010. It is celebrating its 15th Anniversary this year, so they're giving it a quick re-release with this two-nights-only plan. The big news about this re-release is that its getting an update. The IMAX release will be digitally re-mastered into the image \u0026 sound quality of The IMAX Experience. It will also feature a new, immersive IMAX 5.0 sound mix. Black Swan is Aronofsky's thriller about the relationship between a veteran ballet dancer and a rival who's looking to win the same role in the new production of Swan Lake. Starring Natalie Portman \u0026 Mila Kunis, with Winona Ryder, Vincent Cassel, and Barbara Hershey. The superb film (my 2010 review) was nominated for five Academy Awards, but only won one for Natalie Portman as Best Actress (The King's Speech took home Best Picture instead). The score by Clint Mansell is exceptional, and cinematography by Matty Libatique also earned an Oscar nom. Tickets are now on sale at 250 IMAX theatres nationwide for showings around late August. Don't miss a chance to revisit this […]",
