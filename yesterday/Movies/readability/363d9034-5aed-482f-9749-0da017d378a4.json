  "text": "Fans want to know if creator Lorne Michaels is quitting his long-running show Saturday Night Live (SNL). Before the show’s 50th anniversary, Michaels made a comment about his rumored departure, and his latest remarks have provided a sense of hope among the SNL fan base. Here are the details of what Lorne Michaels said about leaving the show. Some of Lorne Michaels’ past remarks had led many fans to believe that he would be departing the show after Season 50. However, the SNL creator has set the records straight on the emerging rumors, revealing that he is not planning to quit. He said, “I may be wrong. But I don’t feel I’m done.” His latest remark has certainly put a lot of rumors to rest. Aside from the current statement, previously, in a conversation with The Hollywood Reporter, Michaels confirmed that he is staying for at least Season 51. “As long as it’s important and I can be useful, I’ll stay… There’s no immediate plan,” he said. The upcoming season is slated to release in the fall of this year. At the time of writing, the cast members and official release date remain undisclosed. Previously, in an interview with the New York Times, Michaels was asked whether the long-running show would possibly end with his tenure. To which, he replied, “I’m not that guy.” This response indicates that Michaels is still committed to SNL’s future and will support its continuity and stability in the years to come even after his retirement. Michaels called the current season an “emotional” one. Emphasizing the show’s grand event, Michaels said, “The 50th will be a big event. We’ll bring everyone back from all 50 years and hosts and all of that. It will be a very emotional and very strong thing. There won’t be as many plus-ones, I can tell you that much.” (via TV Insider)",
