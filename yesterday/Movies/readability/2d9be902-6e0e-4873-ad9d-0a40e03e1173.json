  "text": "Wondering about Taylor Swift and Jaime King’s friendship? The actress and former model once considered Swift one of her closest friends, even naming her the godmother of her son, Leo Thames. However, their relationship has remained largely out of the public eye in recent years, leaving fans questioning whether they are still close. Here’s what we know about their history, their last public interactions, and where they stand today. Are Taylor Swift and Jaime King friends? Taylor Swift and Jaime King were once close friends. King, a model-turned-actress, met Swift at a Golden Globes party in 2014, and their friendship grew from there. In March 2015, King named Swift the godmother of her second son, Leo Thames. “She’s going to be, like, the best godmother in the whole world,” King told People. King frequently shared photos of the two on social media, especially during her pregnancy and after Leo’s birth. Their current friendship status is unclear. While they were last publicly seen together in 2019, when King posted an Instagram photo captioned, “Two nerds in a bed,” there have been no recent joint appearances or social media interactions between them. However, King has continued to reference Swift’s music in her Instagram captions, such as in December 2023, when she quoted lyrics from Swift’s song “The Archer.” King built her career as a model in the 1990s before transitioning into acting, starring in Hart of Dixie, Sin City, and White Chicks. People reported that she married director Kyle Newman in 2007, and they remained together until 2020. They share two sons, James Knight and Leo Thames. Jessica Alba also serves as a godmother to one of King’s children. After their divorce, King faced a lengthy custody battle with Newman. In 2024, a judge granted Newman sole physical custody while allowing King supervised visits. Court documents revealed she had not completed a required six-month drug and alcohol program, which includes weekly testing and counseling. Swift’s social circle has evolved. She remains close with longtime friends like Blake Lively, Selena Gomez, and Emma Stone. More recently, she has connected with Brittany Mahomes and Kylie Kelce.",
