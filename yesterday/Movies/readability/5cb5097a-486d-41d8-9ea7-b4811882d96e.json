Parker Finn values character-driven stories over supernatural explanations in horror. The fear of the unknown remains central to the Smile franchise's horror appeal. Expect more breadcrumbs, not answers, as the Smile series unfolds its chilling narrative. After making over $23 million during its opening weekend, we're feeling confident that the Paramount Pictures horror title Smile 2 could result in yet another entry. It's creepy, makes money, and has plenty of originality to unpack. The potential is limitless. However, it doesn't sound like we should expect any clear answers regarding the lore behind the demonic Smile entity that traumatizes its prey. Here's what was said! During an interview with Variety, filmmaker Parker Finn addressed the lore of the Smile entity, noting, \"I oftentimes feel less is more with things like mythology in horror films, especially if it comes to supernatural stuff. First of all, I'm way more interested in the character story. I love the stuff that goes bump in the night, but I want to use that supernatural push to explore the human horror, the internal psychological stuff. But, also, I find that sometimes when you begin to over-explain it — you give it a name and origin — all the audience begins to defang it. I think the fear of the unknown is much more frightening, but I also think it's worth doling out breadcrumbs to bring an audience along. They're little pieces of candy to eat along the way, which I love — but if I'm answering a question or closing a door, I want to make sure I'm opening two more.\" Naomi Scott stars in Paramount Pictures Presents A Temple Hill Production A Parker Finn FIlm \"SMILE 2\" Smile 2 Cast and Plot Details The sequel follows global pop sensation Skye Riley (Naomi Scott) as she embarks on a world tour.
