  "description": "ðŸ›¸ \"Any extraterrestrial visiting or transiting via Earth, must undergo a mandatory registration process. That's standard protocol!\" This amusing 7-minute short is worth a watch! Oslo-based filmmaker Martin Sofiedal has just debuted his latest creation - a Men in Black fan film tilted Neuralize This! The last real MIB movie they made was Men in Black: International in 2019 (but it got bad reviews) so I'm intrigued that someone is still making fan films for this sci-fi franchise. MIB: Neuralize This! is a fan-made MIB short film â€” a gooey, action-comedy tribute where nothing goes according to protocol. Two agents try to contain an alien incident, but end up dealing with a malfunctioning neuralizer, a Nerf gun, a confused child, and a very angry Polish muscle man. Starring Torgny Gerhard Aanderaa and Cecilie Svendsen, with Eirik Hallert and Lijana Brahimi. With VFX by the same company doing the VFX on Troll 2. It's just the right amount fun using the MIB concept and gimmicks. Everyone wishes they had one of these neuralizers, right? Thanks to Martin for the tip on this short. Intro via YouTube: \"When the alien explodes, the neuralizer fails, and a little girl sees everything... Neuralize This! [â€¦]",
