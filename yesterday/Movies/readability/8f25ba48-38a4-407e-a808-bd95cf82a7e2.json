  "text": "M Studio Thailand is betting big on action as it unveils a varied slate at the ongoing Shanghai International Film \u0026 TV Market, led by Puttipong Nakthong’s thriller “The Last Shot.” The action-thriller, set for release Nov. 27, follows Petch, an assassin desperate to escape his violent past but forced into one final job where “his future and freedom rest on the final bullet.” The film represents the kind of high-concept genre fare that has made M Studio one of Thailand’s most prolific production houses. The Bangkok-based company is riding high following the massive success of 2023’s “Death Whisperer” (aka “Tee Yod”), which shattered Thai box office records with earnings exceeding $14 million domestically alone. The horror hit exemplifies M Studio’s knack for connecting with local audiences while maintaining commercial appeal. Popular on Variety At Shanghai, M Studio is showcasing a diverse lineup that spans multiple genres. Racing comedy “Jazz the Racing,” directed by Poj Arnon and Phadung Samajarn, follows rising motorsport star Jazz as he navigates guilt and redemption after a rival’s death forces him into monkhood. The film explores whether former racing champions can convince Jazz to return to competition. The slate also includes “Nakee 3,” the latest installment in the popular action-drama franchise that intertwines love, destiny and mystical serpent god mythology in what the company describes as a “breathtaking new adventure.” Comedy-action hybrid “Riam Fighting Angel 2” brings back the daring Riam Racing Gang for another high-stakes village rescue mission, while biographical drama “Bit by Bit” tells the story of top student Top Jirayut, an Oxford graduate facing family and societal pressures who must discover “the true cost of success.” Rounding out the lineup are action-thriller “God Skin,” about a writer lured into underground boxing with life-shortening nano-tattoo enhancements, and drama-comedy “The Lion Dance Girl,” following a young designer who returns to her rural hometown to lead a traditional lion dance troupe after her father’s death. M Studio’s prolific output of 10-15 films annually has established the company as a major force in Thai cinema, consistently delivering box office hits across multiple genres. The company’s ability to blend local storytelling with commercial sensibilities has proven particularly effective in the competitive Southeast Asian market.",
