Without further ado, here is a breakdown of everyone arriving and everyone departing Young and Restless this week. Everyone who is leaving and coming to The Young and the Restless’ cast this week Here is a list of everyone arriving on The Young and the Restless this week: Lauralee Bell (Christine Blair Williams) Lauralee Bell will return as Christine this week in Young and Restless, with the episodes focusing on her romantic life. As per the spoilers, Christine’s boyfriend Danny (Michael Damian) is planning to make some major decisions in their relationship. Cait Fairbanks (Tessa Porter) Another important entry this week is Cait Fairbanks, who will return as Tessa. In the upcoming episodes, she will confront Mariah (Camryn Grimes) about the latter’s recent actions. Michael Damian (Danny Romalotti) Michael Damian will also return this week to Y\u0026R as Danny. In the forthcoming week, Danny will talk to his son, Daniel, about his plans for Christine. These are all the arrivals in the show this week. Now, here is a list of who is leaving The Young and the Restless in the week of July 7- July 11, 2025: Melissa Ordway (Abby Newman Abbott Winters) Melissa Ordway already alerted her fans in a social media post that she has not been asked to reprise her role as Abby. However, she also expressed that she was open to a return if the producers asked her. Though Ordway is seemingly departing the show now, she could return for an appearance soon. J. Eddie Peck (Cole Howard) After his character Cole Howard died last week, J. Eddie Peck confirmed his departure from The Young and the Restless.
