  "text": "XO, Kitty Season 2 has finally arrived, and among its storyline’s several dramatic moments is the unraveling of Esther Shim’s secret identity. The second season premiered on Netflix on January 16, 2025, and concluded Kitty’s wild second year at KISS with eight episodes. However, some viewers still have questions about the connection between Esther and Stella, Kitty’s new roommate. So, here’s everything fans need to know about Esther’s identity and story in XO, Kitty Season 2. Who is Esther and how is she connected to Stella in XO, Kitty Season 2? Stella Cho is the alias that Esther Shim uses to execute her plans for revenge against Min-ho Moon’s father. Esther’s identity is first hinted at when, Kitty’s roommate Stella tells her parents, “For the last time, my name is Stella. There is no more Esther.” This immediately alerts the viewers of something sinister going on. The connection between the two names becomes clearer soon after in the following episodes. It is revealed that Esther was previously an aspiring contestant in Mr. Moon’s talent show. However, during her audition, he humiliated and embarrassed her. Mr. Moon told Esther that she would never become a star as she “didn’t have the looks for it.” In reply, she proudly stated, “Beauty is supposed to come from within,” a reaction that went viral online. Hence, Esther swears revenge against Mr. Moon and becomes determined to destroy his reputation and his business. This is the reason why she comes to KISS, begins dating Min-ho, his son, and earns his trust. Aside from Mr. Moon, Esther even tries to sabotage Joon Ho, his eldest son and a superstar in Korea. In the Season 2 finale, she threatens to leak the news that one of his backup dancers is expecting his child. While Kitty previously recognizes Esther as Stella and tries to warn Min-ho about his girlfriend, he does not pay heed to her. Luckily, in the end, they become aware of her plan to ruin not only Mr. Moon’s business but also Joon Ho’s image. Consequently, Kitty and Min-ho team up to save his family’s reputation. They help Joon Ho publicly announce that he truly loves the dancer and that they will soon tie the knot. Stella / Esther does manage to sabotage many of the contestants of Mr. Moon’s talent show. Albeit, he eventually catches her red-handed with Min-ho and Kitty’s help. As Season 2 ends, Mr. Moon sends Esther back to the United States.",
