  "description": "\"You've been given a gift, and it's up to you on how you're going to use it.\" Abramorama has unveiled an official trailer for a film titled The Short Game, a young golfer drama about family.

Ben Krieger stars as Jeremy, a talented golfer, who initially dismisses his autistic brother Ethan's golfing abilities. Faced with the choice between a scholarship and his relationship with Ethan, Jeremy chooses his brother... learning life lessons. A teenage golf prodigy struggling with his game has to care for his autistic brother, who unexpectedly helps him rediscover his confidence—and what truly matters in life. Along with Ben Krieger, the cast includes Mackenzie Astin, Katherine Cunningham, Glenn Morshower, Tyler Lofton, Emma Parks, Adyn Alexander, Brandon Potter, and introducing Owen Himfar as Ethan. There was also a doc in 2013 titled The Short Game about young golfers.

This seems like the cheesy opposite to Happy Gilmore 2, more about the nice side of golf and what's possible when we put family above all else. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Frank Sanza's film The Short Game, direct from YouTube: Jeremy Avery is vying for a college golf scholarship awarded to the winner of the State Championship, but his preparation and game are affected by family pressures related to his mother’s recovery from cancer and having to take care of his younger autistic brother Ethan. These challenges, along with the burden of carrying his team to State against an opponent who will do anything to win, force Jeremy to reconsider his priorities and see his brother’s savant-like gifts, which if embraced can create an unstoppable pair. On the brink of his greatest victory, Jeremy is forced to make a life-altering decision between finally realizing his own personal dreams or standing by his brother. The Short Game is directed by first-time filmmaker Frank Sanza, a former stunt coordinator making his feature directorial debut with this. The screenplay is by Frank Sanza, Larry Boatright, E. Joren Christensen, and Florrie Laurence \u0026 David Parks. It's produced by David Parks. This initially premiered at various film festivals over the last year. Abramorama will debut Sanza's The Short Game in select US theaters starting July 25th, 2025 this summer. Anyone want to watch? Find more posts in: To Watch, Trailer prev next",
