  "text": "Posted in: HBO, Movies, TV | Tagged: lanternsJames Gunn shared what he's seen of Chris Mundy, Damon Lindelof, and Tom King's Aaron Pierre and Kyle Chandler-starring HBO series Lanterns.Earlier this week, we reported on director James Hawes wrapping directing his episodes of Chris Mundy (True Detective: Night Country, Ozark), Damon Lindelof (Watchmen, The Leftovers), and Tom King's (Mister Miracle, Supergirl) Aaron Pierre and Kyle Chandler-starring Lanterns. We also touched upon how the buzz surrounding HBO and DC Studios' Green Lantern series was beginning to get a lot louder, with Hawes, Jason Ritter (Billy Macon), and Warner Bros. Discovery head David Zaslav each having some promising praise and support to share. Earlier today, DC Studios Co-CEO James Gunn also touched on the series during a run of social media updates on several projects. When asked if he has screened early cuts of any episodes yet, Gunn shared that it's been \"scenes and dailies\" so far. As for what he thinks of what he's seen so far, Gunn offered a three-word combo we were hoping to hear: \"It's so cool.\" Image: DC Studios Here's a look at Gunn's response from earlier today, followed by what Hawes shared previously about HBO's Lanterns: Image: Threads Screencap Lanterns: Hawes on \"True Detective\" Talk, Aaron Pierre \u0026 DC Studios Speaking with The Hollywood Reporter in support of his feature film, The Amateur, Hawes addressed the True Detective comparisons, what Pierre brings to the series, and how it's been (so far) working with DC Studios: Hawes on How \"Lanterns\" Compares In Tone to \"True Detective\": \"Talking tone, it looks and feels rooted. You meet two guys, but there is wit and comedy to it that you would not expect in 'True Detective.' It is, in many ways, a buddy cop structure with travel in the story time, to and fro, that is really sophisticated. Chris Mundy has done the most amazing job with the team there, and so I think [the 'True Detective' comparison] is valid. People will still go, 'What were you talking about?' to some extent, but I would also bring in 'No Country for Old Men,' 'Fargo,' and things that have that Americana heart to them. There's a wry humor, and so there definitely is more wit and humor than there is in 'True Detective.'\" Hawes on Aaron Pierre Having a \"Magnificent Presence\": \"I honestly think he did it totally individually in the room. With some chemistry castings and the like, it just felt like he would inhabit the role. He has such a magnificent presence. He feels so forceful, so cool, so understated. Again, I wanted this world to be rooted, and while there's only so far you can go with rooting characters in a show about Green Lantern, they are. This is a world where we accept that the Green Lanterns exist and aliens exist. So the rest of it is played straight and in the world as we know it.\" Hawes on Working with DC Studios: \"Well, I can only tell you from my experience, which is that it has been inspiring and supportive and truly thrilling. I will know more in a few months' time, but right now, [Lanterns] just felt like a real burst of creative energy. Along with Pierre, Chandler, and Fillion, the DC Studios series stars Garret Dillahunt (Fear The Walking Dead), Kelly Macdonald (Boardwalk Empire, In the Line of Duty), Poorna Jagannathan (Never Have I Ever, Deli Boys), Ulrich Thomsen (Counterpart, The Blacklist), Nicole Ari Parker (And Just Like That), Jason Ritter (Matlock), J. Alphonse Nicholson (P-Valley), Sherman Augustus (Stranger Things), Jasmine Cephas Jones (Blindspotting), Chris Coy (Bass Reeves), and Paul Ben-Victor (Nobody Wants This). In addition, Nathan Fillion will be reprising his Superman role as Green Lantern Guy Gardner for the series. Helming the series are directors James Hawes, Stephen Williams, Geeta Vasant Patel, and Alik Sakharov. Based on the DC Comics Green Lantern, the series is executive produced by Mundy, Lindelof, Gunn, Safran, King, Hawes, and Ron Schmidt. Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!
