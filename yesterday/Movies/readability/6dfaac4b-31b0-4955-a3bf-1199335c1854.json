  "text": "Amid a harsh winter, a war is looming in the Montana highlands, forcing the Duttons to “defend or die” when their ranch is at the center of a bitter battle over the state’s changing landscape at the hands of the powers that be. “Today, we begin making Montana a playground for the elite,” a voice declares to a boardroom of captains of industry who applaud at the announcement, in Paramount+‘s new trailer for 1923 Season 2. Starring Academy Award nominee Harrison Ford and Oscar-winner Helen Mirren, the Yellowstone origin story co-created by Taylor Sheridan returns Feb. 23, with additional stars Brandon Sklenar, Julia Schlaepfer, Jerome Flynn, Darren Mann, Brian Geraghty, Aminah Nieves, Michelle Randolph, Sebastian Roché, Timothy Dalton and Jennifer Carpenter. Per the installment’s logline, “In the second season of 1923, a cruel winter brings new challenges and unfinished business to Jacob (Ford) and Cara (Mirren) back at Dutton ranch. With harsh conditions and adversaries threatening to end the Dutton legacy, Spencer (Sklenar) embarks on an arduous journey home, racing against time to save his family in Montana. Meanwhile, Alexandra (Schlaepfer) sets off on her own harrowing trans-Atlantic journey to find Spencer and reclaim their love.” Watch on Deadline Produced by MTV Entertainment Studios, 101 Studios and Bosque Ranch Productions, executive producers are Sheridan, David C. Glasser, John Linson, Art Linson, Ron Burkle, David Hutkin, Bob Yari, Ben Richardson, Michael Friedman and Keith Cox. The series is distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution.  Sheridan’s growing Paramount+ slate also includes series Landman, Lioness, Tulsa King, Mayor of Kingstown, Lawmen: Bass Reeves and 1883. The official trailer debut comes after a first teaser was released for the second season during Yellowstone‘s finale back in December.",
