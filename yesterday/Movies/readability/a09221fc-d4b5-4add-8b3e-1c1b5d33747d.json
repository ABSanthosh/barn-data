IMAX just posted a few videos highlighting the massive success of Ryan Coogler's Sinners and the spectacular experiencing of watching it in IMAX. Sinners is currently playing strong in its second week of release – everyone is flipping out watching this movie and telling everyone else to go see it. Thanks to the success, IMAX announced that they are giving away collectible filmtrips of few frames of 70mm film for anyone going back to watch Sinners (again) in IMAX during its second week. I want one! Earlier this month we also posted the video created by Kodak \u0026 Ryan Coogler where he discuses the various aspect ratios, film formats, and many other projection details for the movie's big screen release.

Basically a big geek out session which is cool with me. To find IMAX theaters showing Sinners and where you can view it projected BIG - head to their official site. You can rewatch the first trailer for Ryan Coogler's Sinners right here or the second trailer here + one more. A new vision of fear from director Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan. \"You keep dancing with the devil, one day he's gonna follow you home.\" Trying to leave their troubled lives behind, twin brothers (Jordan) return to their hometown to start again, only to discover that an even greater evil is waiting to welcome them back. Sinners is written and directed by the acclaimed American writer / producer / filmmaker Ryan Coogler, of the movies Fruitvale Station, Creed, Black Panther, and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever previously. Produced by Coogler and frequent collaborators Sev Ohanian and Zinzi Coogler. Exec produced by Ludwig Göransson, Will Greenfield, and Rebecca Cho. A Proximity Media Production. Featuring a score by Ludwig Göransson, and cinematography by Autumn Durald Arkapaw. Warner Bros will debut Coogler's Sinners in US theaters nationwide starting April 18th, 2025 this spring. Who's excited to watch this soon? Find more posts in: Feat, Featurette, Hype, To Watch prev next",
