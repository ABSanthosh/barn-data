  "text": "Derek Hough is certainly known by family and friends for his generosity of spirit. But this probably wasn’t the kind of giving moment he was looking to stage during the holidays. During a brief respite from his Dance for the Holidays: The New Tour, the Dancing with the Stars judge posted on Instagram that he spent $8,000 on his cat for Christmas. But it wasn’t because his pet was demanding an extremely expensive toy: Hough’s cat Otis ate a bunch of crap not meant for feline consumption that ended up costing a small fortune to remove at the vet’s office. “Look what I go for Christmas,” Hough wrote on Instagram. “A plastic bag filled with stuff Otis ate and had to be removed from his stomach costing $8,000. Ya! Glad he’s ok.” Watch on Deadline Hough is in Los Angeles after performing with his wife Hayley Erbert and troupe at the You Tube Theater December 21. The performance was made all the more special because it featured a guest appearance by Mark Ballas, who joined Hough in recreating their Argentine tango for the crowd. The two men first performed the dance during the season 33 finale of DWTS. Hough told Deadline that “we wanted to soft launch the idea of two men dancing together on Dancing with the Stars, you know what I mean? It became sort of like an introduction, if you will, and left the door open a little bit for some future partnerships on the show.”",
