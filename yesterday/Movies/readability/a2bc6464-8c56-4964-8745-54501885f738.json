Speaking to Andy Cohen during a recent episode of his Watch What Happens Live! series, Parker was answering questions from the audience. One asked about the possibility of a third entry in the legendary and cult classic Hocus Pocus franchise, to which the star gave an optimistic response to. “No more developments other than we would like to do it,” Parker said (via Deadline). “We’ve been having some conversations.” While a third film has been rumored to be in development ever since the second’s release, no real information has been revealed. Alongside Parker, both Bette Midler and Kathy Najimy expressed interest in returning, as did original stars Omri Katz, Vinessa Shaw, and Jason Marsden. Originally released in 1993 by Disney, Hocus Pocus stars Bette Midler, Parker, and Kathy Najimy as the Sanderson sisters, three witches who are resurrected by a teenage boy in Salem, Massachusetts on Halloween night. The film received mixed reviews upon its launch, but very quickly gained a huge audience after the film began airing on the Disney Channel and Freeform (formerly ABC Family) during the month of October. Since then, it’s become a cult classic of sorts, and in 2022, a sequel was released in 2022 on Disney+. That film, Hocus Pocus 2, saw the three main stars return to the franchise, and also featured Sam Richardson, Doug Jones, Whitney Peak, Belissa Escobedo, Tony Hale, and Hannah Waddingham. The sequel also earned mixed reviews, but was celebrated by fans and earned three nominations at the 75th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Television Movie.",
