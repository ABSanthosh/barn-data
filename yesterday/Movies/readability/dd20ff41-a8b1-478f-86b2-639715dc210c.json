  "text": "California has had many wildfires, especially in the last few years. From the Camp Fire in 2018 that destroyed 95% of the structures in Butte County towns Paradise and Concow to the Tubbs Fire in 2017 that ate up portions of Napa, Sonoma, and Lake counties, climate change has made the frequency and ferocity of these events all too familiar, but the flames tearing across the mountains surrounding Los Angeles have shined a new light on the crisis for many. As Los Angeles remains America’s second largest city — and the main hub for the entertainment industry, as well as a home to millions — coverage of the devastation has been constant, with particular focus placed on the celebrities who’ve lost their homes. Two of the communities affected by the fires are the Pacific Palisades and Malibu, both affluent areas where the likes of Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Eugene Levy, Adam Brody and Leighton Meister, Paris Hilton, Jeff Bridges, and more have all lost their homes. Also among this group is Jamie Lee Curtis, who, despite her situation, has already offered to donate $1 million to fire relief efforts. With the Los Angeles Fire Department caught off guard by the ferocity of the conditions it faced when the fires first started — including wind speeds from the Santa Anas reaching 90 mph, decreased water pressure from fire hydrants due to demand, and residents abandoning cars and blocking emergency vehicles from reaching the flames — many are calling for the government to boost its resources. But for now, the best way to help is by donating what you can. Keep reading below to find out where you can give, as well as resources for those directly affected by the fires. American Red Cross The American Red Cross has already leaped into action in Los Angeles, moving thousands of cots and blankets and setting up shelters around the county, providing resources to families who’ve lost their homes, as well as support for first responders. They have already sent in many disaster relief workers, but those interested in volunteering can visit their website. If you’re interested in donating directly to helping with the Los Angeles fires, please mail checks directly to the Red Cross with the memo line “California Wildfires 2025” and a completed donation form. California Community Foundation A non-profit focused on addressing quality-of-life issues faced by those in Los Angeles County, the California Community Foundation has dealt with matters ranging from education to immigration for over 100 years. So if you’re concerned about your money going to a reputable organization, fear not. It has already put a Wildfire Recovery Fund in place and is seeking donations now. Once the flames die down and the media vans have driven off, there will still be a great deal of work to be done in repairing the lives of the Los Angeles community and the CCF will continue to be there for it. California Fire Foundation Focused on catering to fallen firefighters and their surviving families, the California Fire Foundation also offers victim assistance and outreach efforts related to fire prevention. Their Supplying Aid to Victims of Emergency (SAVE) provides immediate, short-term relief like funds for medicines, food, and clothing. They also have a specific fund for Wildfire \u0026 Disaster Relief that you can donate to online. Entertainment Industry Foundation Leveraging the power of celebrity to be a force for good, the Entertainment Industry Foundation has been the philanthropy arm of the Hollywood machine for more than 80 years. Stars like Olivia Rodrigo, Charlize Theron, George Clooney, Don Cheadle, and more often participate in its global initiatives. Working with Defy: Disaster, EIF has already set up a direct donation link for Wildfire \u0026 Disaster Relief efforts, but you can also donate via the EIF website to multiple efforts. Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation While being spread thin isn’t the only reason firefighters struggled to take on the flames that consumed the Palisades and Malibu, as well as Altadena and Pasadena, it certainly could use more resources in taking on these continuing disasters. Donating directly to the LAFD Foundation would be the best way to support the organization, but it also has set up a Wildfire Emergency Funding Alert that benefits ongoing efforts. Los Angeles Regional Food Bank Distributing food and operating nutrition programs throughout Los Angeles County, the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank has worked with the children, seniors, and families of the city to curb the number of individuals going hungry. For those wishing to volunteer, the Food Bank is always looking for people to donate their time and have launched a webpage directly focused on connecting both those in need and those who want to help with resources to aid in those efforts. Mutual Aid Los Angeles Network From working with unhoused communities to providing resources for those who want to give back, the Mutual Aid Los Angeles Network (or MALAN) is on the front lines everyday. So when it comes to a crisis, it’s always ready to lend a hand. Its volunteers have already set up a spreadsheet filled with resources like restaurants offering food to evacuees and those who have been displaced, as well as boarding locations for animals, workspace areas, and shelters. You can either donate to the businesses and organizations listed or directly to MALAN via their website. Will Rogers Motion Picture Pioneers Foundation Though it’s mostly celebrities who’ve lost their houses getting the press right now, there are thousands of industry workers who call Los Angeles home and many have been struggling since production halts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Will Rogers Motion Pictures Pioneers Foundation has been there to help during these times and it’s not stopping now. With the wildfires destroying homes of many below-the-line film workers, its Pioneers Assistance Fund will provide financial help and counseling to all those in need, while their Natural Disaster Assistance will also be made available to all eligible applicants, including vendors, theatrical exhibitionists, and those in trade services.
