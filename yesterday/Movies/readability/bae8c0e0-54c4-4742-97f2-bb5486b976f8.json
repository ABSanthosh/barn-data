It’s also awesome, depending on the title, the label, and the release, so each week we take a look at the new Blu-rays and DVDs making their way into the world. Welcome to this week in Home Video for October 15th, 2024! This week’s home video selection includes Brick and Cowboys \u0026 Aliens in 4K, the complete Captain Planet, and more. Check out our picks below. Brick [4K UHD, KL Studio Classics] What is it? A high school noir. Why see it? It feels somewhat diminishing to label this simply as a high school noir, but that sets a legitimate vibe going in for a film that soon blossoms into something far more. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a teen a bit wiser than his years, who can’t move on after the death of a friend. Writer/director Rian Johnson fills the film with shady, weird, and welcome characters alongside a mystery that doesn’t quite go where expected. Johnson has moved onto bigger films, but this remains one of his very best with its masterful take on loneliness, obsession, and indifference wrapped up in beautiful atmosphere. Kino’s new 4K may not be a revelation, but it’s still a noticeable upgrade at times as the film plays with shadows and menacing stillness. [Extras: New 4K scan, commentaries, deleted scenes, featurette] The Best Cross Creek [KL Studio Classics] What is it? A woman finds her voice. Why see it? Mary Steenburgen is a national treasure, and once upon a time, Hollywood used to give her leading roles. Here she plays real-life writer Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, a woman tired of the constraints put on her by late 20s society, who decides to leave it all behind for a life in the backwoods of Florida. It’s there where she finds wonder, friendship, inspiration, and more. It’s a sweet, engaging film, anchored by a terrific lead performance. Add in Peter Coyote, Rip Torn, and some beautiful landscapes, and you have a film you’ll want to revisit and share with family. [Extras: Featurette, commentary] The Rest Captain Planet and the Planeteers: The Complete Franchise What is it? Goody goodies unite! Why see it? I kid, Captain Planet, I kid. But also I don’t. The character is an interplanetary being who can be summoned by five kids trying to keep the Earth clean, and the idea is that kids watching will learn about the dangers of pollution and such, and then go out and do the right thing. We get bad guys who have to be taught a lesson about mistreating Mother Nature, and a handful of familiar voices guest star including Meg Ryan, Martin Sheen, and more. It’s ultimately as lightweight and formulaic as most kids’ cartoons, but it comes with a side of preachy that sometimes interrupts the fun. This set includes both the original cartoon and The New Adventures of Captain Planet. [Extras: None] Cowboys \u0026 Aliens [4K UHD, KL Studio Classics] What is it? A western with aliens! Why see it? Jon Favreau’s ambitious adaptation of a popular comic is a better time than you’re probably remembering, even if it still doesn’t reach the level of all that great. That said, it’s hard not to have some fun here as Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford saddle up for a genre mash bringing six-shooters and horses up against alien tech. The contrast is a fun time, and the supporting cast helps too with great faces like Walton Goggins, Keith Carradine, Clancy Brown, Paul Dano, Sam Rockwell, and more. It arguably overstays its welcome a bit, the extended version more so, but you can’t knock the intentions and the minor thrills. [Extras: New 4K scan, commentary, interviews, featurette, theatrical and extended cuts] Garbo Talks [KL Studio Classics] What is it? A dying woman has one thing left on her to-do list. Why see it? The great Sidney Lumet directs this dramatic comedy, and while I’m not convinced it’s material that suits his particular skills, the result is still an engaging look the things we prioritize in our lives and families. Anne Bancroft headlines alongside Ron Silver, Carrie Fisher, and Catherine Hicks, and everyone is doing good work. There are minor laughs and some sweet moments, but the buildup doesn’t get the payoff you’re hoping for. It’s partially by design, but that doesn’t make it any better. [Extras: Commentary] Also out this week: Babylon Berlin: Season 4, The Boy in the Woods, Demon Pond [4K UHD, Criterion], A Nightmare on Elm Street [4K UHD], The Summer With Carmen, Thanksgiving [4K UHD], To Catch a Thief [4K UHD]",
