  "text": "André 3000 has released a collection of piano instrumental tracks entitled “7 Piano Sketches.” The musician released the project just before walking the carpet at the Met Gala with a full piano strapped to his back. “7 Piano Sketches” was partially composed and recorded before 2023’s instrumental flute album “New Blue Sun,” which went on to earn a nomination for album of the year at the 2025 Grammy Awards. André conceptualized the project almost a decade ago while staying with his son at a house in Texas that only had a piano, their beds and TV screens. Stream “7 Piano Sketches” here. With the release, André made sure to note: “WARNING: NO BARS.” Popular on Variety In a statement accompanying the project, André said, “The original title for it was ‘The Best Worst Rap Album In History’ and here is an excerpt from the original liner notes: ‘It’s jokingly the worst rap album in history because there are no lyrics on it at all. It’s the best because it’s the free-est emotionally and best I’ve felt personally. It’s the best because it’s like a palette cleanser for me.’” The release comes shortly after the news that Outkast, his duo alongside Big Boi, will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame alongside Cyndi Lauper, White Stripes, Chubby Checker, Warren Zevon and more. André last released “New Blue Sun” in Nov. 2023, a surprise to fans who were expecting another rap album from the musician. Speaking with Variety shortly after his Grammy nominations for the project, he explained that he followed his instincts to put the album together. “I’m used to people feeling a way, but at the same time, it’s just proof for me that I can only do what I’m into,” he said. “I think that’s why I’m here. I get up on trying to expand myself. I have to be fun and be into what I’m doing. That’s it.” Check out the tracklist for “7 Piano Sketches” below: bluffing in the snow and then one day you’ll … when you’re a ant and you wake up in an awesome mood, about to drive your son to school, only to discover that you left the lights on in the car last night so your battery is drained hotel lobby pianos blueberry mansions off rhythm laughter i spend all day waiting for the night",
