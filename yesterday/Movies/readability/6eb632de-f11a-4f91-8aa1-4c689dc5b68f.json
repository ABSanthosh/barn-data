  "text": "UPDATED, Friday PM: Universal/DreamWorks Animation’s Dog Man is fetching a great opening of $33 million per afternoon figures, with Friday expected to come in at $10M at 3,885 locations, including previews. That’s higher than the comps for this younger-skewing property (65% of the kids audience was under 9 years old last night), which are Captain Underpants at a $23.8M opening, DC League of Pets at $23M and Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie at $22.7M. Since the strikes and Covid, it’s clear: kids fare rules. Seriously, during the pandemic, there were fears by some executives that families would never come back to cinemas. So not true; they even come back to cinemas when the movie is on PVOD. With a social media universe of 246.6M across TikTok, X, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, RelishMix says “positive convo on Dog Man is through the roof, attracting long-time fans of the book series which the film is adapted from as well as casual animation fans who are intrigued by the wacky comedic antics and alluring style. Comments include, ‘Loved the books as a kid, I might be a little too old for it now but I think I might sneak a watch lmao. Absolutely can’t wait for this one! The official sequel of spinoff to Captain Underpants. It looks great!” and, ‘Looks amazing. The animation is awesome and it got the essence of the Dev Pilkey’s comic book’.” Watch on Deadline Dog Man‘s social media reach is higher than DWA’s The Bad Guys (212M) before opening and Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie (117.5M). New Line’s terror movie Companion, which is wired with excellent word of mouth, is eyeing $4M today including previews, with an eye at $10M and a chance for upside in second at 3,285 theaters. At that level, at a less than $10M production cost (updated, we hear) and $29M global P\u0026A, if this Sophie Thatcher-starring movie ultimately crosses $40M-$50M stateside, we hear it’s in a range to profit for the Burbank lot. We saw this earlier this year with Sony spending a conservative P\u0026A on a movie with great exits, that being One of Them Days. Currently Yellowjackets star Thatcher’s biggest opening at the domestic box office belongs to 2023’s The Boogeyman ($12.3M opening, $43.2M domestic/$67.3M global, $35M production cost, and very low Rotten Tomatoes audience score at 66%). (L-R) ‘Sonic the Hedgehog 3’ and ‘Mufasa: The Lion King’ Everett Collection In third for the frame is the seventh weekend of Disney’s Mufasa: The Lion King with $1.45M today, a $7M three-day total (-19%) at 3,180 theaters and a running cume by Sunday of $230.4M. By the way, the lion may have come into the marketplace as a lamb before Christmas opening to $35.4M (behind Paramount’s Sonic the Hedgehog 3‘s $60.1M) but by the end of this weekend, the King of the Jungle will be $300K shy of overtaking the fast, blue critter (Sonic 3 stands at $230.7M). Fourth is the third weekend of Sony’s R-rated SZA-Keke Palmer comedy One of Them Days with $1.6M today, $6M (-25%) for the weekend and $34.4M by Sunday. Fifth is the second weekend of Lionsgate’s Mel Gibson-directed, Mark Wahlberg-starring Flight Risk at 3,161 sites, with $1.4M today, $5M (-57%) for the 3-day and $20.3M by Sunday EOD. PREVIOUSLY, Friday AM: Universal/DreamWorks Animation’s feature take of Dav Pilkey’s Dog Man bit $1.36M in previews last night, which comps to DWA’s previews for The Bad Guys ($1.15M) and Trolls Band Together ($1.3M), those movies respectively opening to $23.9M and $30M. Dog Man is expected to be the first notable opening of the year, north of $20M. Quorum reports: “Dog Man has been on the rise. Two weeks ago, it was tracking behind Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie, which opened to $23M. Today, awareness and unaided awareness are much higher than Paw. Could Dog reach $30M? It certainly seems possible.” Dads and moms under 35 are the strongest as far as those who’ll pay to see the movie in a theater. Dog Man is 4 1/2 stars with kids and parents in Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak exits. The movie is booked at 3,885 theaters. Previews started Thursday at 2 p.m. in 2,950 venues. The animated pic is 77% fresh with Rotten Tomatoes critics. New Line’s R-rated horror film Companion is on fire in exits with a solid 4 stars on PostTrak, a 94% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, and 95% certified fresh with critics. However, the femme bot movie from BoulderLight Pictures and written and directed by Drew Hancock is only supposed to do $8M-$11M. Thursday previews, which began at 3 p.m., were at $1.1M; the total preview number is $1.7M including Monday Mystery screenings. Quorum notes, “Three weeks ago, just before Warner Bros. kicked the campaign into high gear with a trailer and poster, Companion was tracking to open below $5M. Since then, awareness has tripled, and interest has climbed ten points.” As far as comps, Universal’s R-rated Violent Night posted $1.1M on its way to a $13.4M opening back in 2022. Last year’s Blumhouse PG-13 title Night Swim made $1.45M in previews before opening to $11.7M, while more recently, the R-rated Wolf Man made $1.4M before continuing on to $10.8M. M3GAN, the ultimate femme bot movie, did $2.75M in previews before seducing a $30.4M opening as a PG-13 offering. The rest of the week went like this: 1.) Flight Risk (LG) 3,161 theaters, Thu $767K (-48% from Wed), Week $14.6M/Wk 1 2.) One of Them Days (Sony) 2,675 theaters, Thu $743K (-39%), Week $10.68M, Total $27.8M/Wk 2 3. ) Mufasa (Dis) 3,420 theaters, Thu $605K (-30%), Week $10.5M, Total $222.9M/Wk 6 4.) Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (Par) 3,097 theaters, Thu $367K (-36%), Week $6.4M, Total $227M/Wk 6 5.) Moana 2 (Dis) 2,550 theaters, Thu $287K (-26%), Week $5.1M, Total $450.8M/Wk 9",
