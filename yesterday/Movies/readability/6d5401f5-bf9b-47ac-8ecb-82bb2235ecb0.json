  "description": "\"Am I a bad mother?\" Uh oh. Dark Star Pictures has unveiled the official trailer for Mom, an indie horror film ready for release in February. This first premiered at FrightFest Glasgow last year - and is out on VOD in February if anyone wants to give it a look. Meredith, her husband Jared, and their young son Alex face unspeakable terror in the wake of a family tragedy. The tagline: \"A mother's love never dies.\" Struggling with postnatal depression \u0026 feeling misunderstood by her husband, Meredith begins to experience terrifying visions foreshadowing an ultimate tragedy - ending up stuck in a nightmarish loop ruled by a malevolent force. Mom stars Emily Hampshire as Meredith, the titular \"Mom\" in this story, with François Arnaud, Christian Convery, Tristan D. Lalla, Cat Lemieux, and Erika Rosenbaum. This looks creepy but it also looks like another seriously underlit, uninteresting, fairly boring horror film that'll be forgotten quickly. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Adam O'Brien's horror film Mom, direct from YouTube: Meredith (Emily Hampshire), a grieving mother, is left utterly alone after the devastating death of her newborn son shatters her world.

Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Adam O'Brien's horror film Mom, direct from YouTube: Meredith (Emily Hampshire), a grieving mother, is left utterly alone after the devastating death of her newborn son shatters her world. Abandoned by her partner and family, she retreats into the suffocating silence of her home, where isolation consumes her. However, her son's tragic death has birthed something far darker – an entity forged from anguish \u0026 loss. This malevolent force seeps into her life, manipulating her reality and forcing her to relive the harrowing moments of her past in an endless, nightmarish loop. Mom, also known as Mama in a few other countries, is directed by indie genre filmmaker Adam O'Brien, making his feature directorial debut after many other short films + horror segments previously. The screenplay is written by Philip Kalin-Hajdu; story by Adam O'Brien; based on an original idea by Albert I. Melamed, Nathan Oliver, Taylor Sardoni. Produced by Adam O'Brien, Benoit Beaulieu, Albert I. Melamed, Philip Kalin-Hajdu. This initially premiered at the 2024 Glasgow FrightFest last year. Dark Star Pictures debuts O'Brien's Mom film direct-to-VOD starting on February 11th, 2025 this winter. Who's interested? Find more posts in: Horror, Indies, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
