  "text": "It’s your time to fly, Hiccup. A new teaser for “How to Train Your Dragon,” the live action adaptation of the acclaimed animated series, made its debut during the Super Bowl on Sunday, February 9. The teaser is a high-flying spectacle that remains true to the look of the animated original film from 2010 while making everything else much more photorealistic. In a teaser from November, we got to see the young Viking Hiccup (Mason Thames) as he encounters an especially rare, mythical dragon he comes to name Toothless. The design of Toothless and that scene in particular is strikingly similar to the first meeting between character and dragon in the original animated film, though with some touched up animation and CGI from the VFX house Framestore. The new trailer offers a more in-depth look at some of the action, humor, and heart that the original had in spades. “How to Train Your Dragon” is written and directed by Dean DeBlois, who co-directed and created the franchise and followed it through two more films, some spinoff series, and $1.6 billion at the global box office. He’s also reuniting with Gerard Butler as Hiccup’s dad Stoick, who voiced the character in the original series but is now playing him in live action. The film also stars Nico Parker, Julian Dennison, Gabriel Howell, Bronwyn James, and Nick Frost. “How to Train Your Dragon” is one of Universal‘s biggest tentpole properties arriving this summer, and it will premiere in theaters and on IMAX screens (it was shot in IMAX as well) on June 13, 2025. Check out the new teaser below:",
