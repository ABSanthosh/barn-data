  "description": "\"I'm a monster.\" Voltage Pictures has unveiled an official trailer for a horror movie called O.T.H.E.R, a French production made by the French filmmaker David Moreau. He most recently made the awesome one-long-take horror film MadS, which I highly recommend watching (it's on Shuddder). O.T.H.E.R is filmed in English, starring actress Olga Kurylenko as a woman who returns home to discover a strange secret there. Alice reluctantly returns to her childhood home after her mother's death. During her visit, Alice gradually gets to know the peculiar features of her surroundings and, eventually, learns the disturbing truth: she is being watched by a camera surveillance system, and a cloaked figure lurks around and drives her towards a horrifying revelation. What is going on in this creepy home?! Starring Olga Kurylenko, Philip Schurer, and Jean Schatz. This film has plenty of style and looks disquieting, but it's hard to really make sense of what is happening in this. All these weird VHS tapes? Weird dude following her? Any idea what is going on? Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for David Moreau's horror film O.T.H.E.R, direct from YouTube: This unsettling horror thriller movie follows Alice (starring Olga Kurylenko), who reluctantly returns to […]",

O.T.H.E.R is directed by French genre filmmaker David Moreau, also director of the films Them, The Eye, It Boy, Seuls, King, and MadS previously. The screenplay is written by Jon Goldman. Produced by Clément Miserez and Matthieu Warter. This hasn't premiered at any festivals or elsewhere, as far as we know. It will open first in France starting on July 9th, 2025 this summer. No final US release date has been set yet - stay tuned for updates. Any good? Find more posts in: Horror, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
