  "text": "With the highly anticipated second season officially on Netflix now, the first Squid Game Season 3 poster has been released, teasing the final season of the hit series. The new poster doesn’t highlight much of what to expect from the third season, but Netflix’s post on X does mention that the season will release in 2025, as the second and third seasons of the series were filmed back-to-back. You can check out the Squid Game Season 3 poster below: What do we know about Squid Game Season 3? It’s unclear exactly what will happen in Squid Game Season 3, but it is the currently planned final season of the hit Netflix show. Despite this, creator Hwang Dong-hyuk doesn’t think it means the end of Squid Game as a whole. While talking to The Wrap, Hwang said, “I know Netflix has a plan [for more Squid Game]. They are not going to throw this idea away.” Netflix has already announced a sequel season for the ongoing spin-off series, Squid Game: The Challenge. Moreover, an English-language adaptation of the show has also received confirmation, with the legendary David Fincher developing the remake. The cast of Season 2 of Squid Game includes Gong Yoo, Yim Si-wan, Kang Ha-neul, Park Gyu-young, Lee Jin-uk, Park Sung-hoon, Yang Dong-geun, Kang Ae-sim, Lee David, Choi Seung-hyun, Roh Jae-won, Jo Yu-ri, and Won Ji-an. Hwang Dong-hyuk serves as the writer, director, and executive producer for the new season of the series. He said of Squid Game Season 2 when speaking to Tudum in 2022, “There’s definitely a lot of pressure on how to make [Season 2] even better. I know that a lot of the different fans and audiences have enjoyed the series very much, but, really, we’re focusing on how to make it even more joyful to the global audience.”  The first season of Squid Game was released in September 2021. It quickly became one of Netflix’s most-watched series of all time, and went on to win a number of different awards, including the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (Lee Jung-jae), Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series (Hwang Dong-hyuk), and more.",
