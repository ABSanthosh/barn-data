  "text": "In his trademark flippant delivery, Oscar winner Kieran Culkin recently joked that Hunger Games fans should “lower those expectations” regarding his forthcoming portrayal of master of ceremonies Caesar Flickerman, first originated by Stanley Tucci in the Lionsgate film adaptations of Suzanne Collins’ beloved books. A recent TikTok from user @lielbernis saw the actor signing Playbills for Glengarry Glen Ross, in which he stars alongside Bob Odenkirk and Bill Burr at Broadway’s Palace Theatre, and as he was told he’d make an “amazing” Caesar Flickerman, the Succession alum responded: “I don’t think so, lower those expectations, please. Please do. I have no idea what I’m gonna do with that.” The A Real Pain star was later asked to comment further on his words by Entertainment Tonight Online, shaking his head and saying, “Did I say that? F—.” Watch on Deadline Culkin is perhaps as known for his award-winning performances as Roman Roy (Succession) and Benji (A Real Pain) as he is for his signature carefree attitude, which has colored everything from stage speeches to late-night appearances. Certainly underselling himself (he is halfway to an EGOT, after all), Culkin joins an all-star cast for The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping, which includes Elle Fanning as Effie Trinket (originated by Elizabeth Banks) and Ralph Fiennes as President Snow (originated by the late Donald Sutherland). The hotly anticipated and buzzy continuation of the preeminently popular dystopian YA series follows 2023’s entry The Ballad of Songbirds \u0026 Snakes, led by Rachel Zegler in a prequel that told the story of the 10th edition of the murderous arena. In Sunrise on the Reaping, viewers will watch as the story of Haymitch Abernathy unfolds; first portrayed by Woody Harrelson as a drunken and world-weary mentor, Joseph Zada (We Were Liars) will trace the origins of the man through his traumatic experiences in the second Quarter Quell. Directed by Francis Lawrence from a script by Billy Ray based off of Collins’ recently released novel of the same name, the film is due in theaters Nov. 20, 2026.",
