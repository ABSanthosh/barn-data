The 14-minute short is made by Nick Martini and Stept Studios with remarkable shots and recreations. In 1982, mountain rescue volunteers attempt to locate and retrieve missing hikers lost in a snow storm up on New Hampshire's Mount Washington (see Google Maps) - known as one of the coldest places. \"A tale of resilience, grit and about how an attempted rescue changed not only the course of two climbers' lives - but also the future of prosthetics, forever.\" The filmmakers add: \"We created this film alongside a team of incredible filmmakers who share a profound love for the mountains and the communities that surround them. Two years on, this story continues to resonate deeply with us all.\" With Joe Lentini, Hugh Herr, Alexa Siegel, Paul Cormier. This is such a well-made doc that grabs your attention and holds onto it right until the end. Worth a watch. Thanks to Vimeo Staff Picks for the tip on this short film online.
