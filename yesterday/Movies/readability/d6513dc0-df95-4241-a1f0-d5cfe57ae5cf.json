The pop icon, known for her close relationship with her mother, has channeled her emotions about the latter’s health journey into her music, giving fans glimpses into her family life. So, here’s a look at Andrea Swift’s heroic cancer battle, treatment, and her current health status. What happened to Taylor Swift’s mom? The “Cruel Summer” singer broke the news of her mother’s first cancer diagnosis directly to fans in 2015. “This is something my family and I thought you should know about now,” Taylor Swift wrote in a now-deleted Tumblr post. She explained that she had asked Andrea to get screened as a Christmas gift. “There were no red flags and she felt perfectly fine, but she did it just to get me and my brother off her case about it,” Swift shared. When the results came back, the family discovered Andrea had cancer. (via People) Meanwhile, the “Mirrorball” hitmaker’s mother’s health battle continued, as she informed fans in 2020 that Andrea’s cancer had returned while filming Miss Americana. In the Netflix documentary, the mother-daughter duo also opened up about chemotherapy and more during a private jet journey. In the documentary, the multiple Grammy winner reflected on how her mother’s cancer battle changed her perspective on life. She remarked, “Do you really care if the internet doesn’t like you today if your mom is sick from her chemo?” In a 2020 Variety interview, Taylor Swift shared more details, revealing that during the second cancer’s treatment, doctors also found out her mother has a brain tumor. While “chemo” was hard enough, the “symptoms” of the brain tumor added more ordeals for Andrea, she added. Since the documentary, Swift has not offered the latest health update of Andrea. Nevertheless, fans hope that the battling days of cancer are finally over for her. Additionally, Taylor Swift channeled her experience witnessing her mom’s cancer battle into the song, “Soon You’ll Get Better,” from her 2019 album, Lover. The heart-wrenching song revealed the singer’s fear during hospital visits, about praying for her mother’s recovery and finding faith in desperate times.",
