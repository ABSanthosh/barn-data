  "text": "Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande have squashed any bad blood — for good. Ahead of “SNL50: The Anniversary Celebration,” Davidson told Page Six that he and Grande don’t see each other that often, but when they do, things are friendly. “When we see each other, which is few and far between, because we’re not in the same circles, it’s all love,” he said. “I’ve had some pretty adult relationships with some pretty amazing women, and when it’s ended it’s been cool.” Davidson added that he hopes his ex-fiancée, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her supporting performance as Glinda the Good in “Wicked,” wins big on awards night: “I hope she wins the Oscar, I hope she takes the gold.” Popular on Variety Grande and Davidson began dating in May of 2018, getting engaged a month later in June and ultimately calling things off in October after a four-month engagement. The “we can’t be friends” singer isn’t the only member of the “Wicked” team nominated on Oscar night: John M Chu’s star-studded musical nabbed 10 nominations, including best actress for Cynthia Erivo, best picture, best costume design and best makeup and hairstyling. Grande’s competition in the best supporting actress category includes Felicity Jones for “The Brutalist,” Monica Barbaro for “A Complete Unknown,” Isabella Rossellini for “Conclave” and Zoe Saldana for the embattled “Emilia Pérez.” The 97th Academy Awards ceremony will broadcast live from the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on Sunday, March 2. The ceremony will begin at 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET, an hour earlier than the previous 5 PT start time.",
