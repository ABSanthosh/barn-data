  "text": "It’s official: Ready or Not 2 is in the works. The news is getting announced tonight by Radio Silence at a Searchlight screening for their 2019 cult horror pic which started it all. Principal photography and release date will be announced at a later date. Ready or Not launched Radio Silence to a greater marquee fame to stateside audiences in addition to the movie’s lead Australian actress Samara Weaving. The actress recently told ComicBook.com, “I’m all in. I think we’re all in, I don’t know. I think we’re all in…I don’t know if we’ve had our blood handshake, but pretty much. We’ve done the spit handshake, but we haven’t cut each other’s hands and rubbed our blood together.” VP of Production Richard Ruiz and Creative Executive Cornelia Burleigh will be overseeing the sequel for Searchlight Pictures, reporting to Co-Heads of Production and Development DanTram Nguyen and Katie Goodson-Thomas. Watch on Deadline The original Ready or Not followed a young bride (Weaving) as she joined her new husband’s (Mark O’Brien) rich, eccentric family (Adam Brody, Henry Czerny, Andie MacDowell) in a time-honored tradition that turned into a lethal game with everyone fighting for their survival. The pic racked up $28.7M domestic, $57.6M worldwide off a $6M production cost. Searchlight is celebrating their 30th anniversary with a screening series of their pics. Radio Silence is otherwise known as Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett. The duo went on to reboot Spyglass/Paramount’s Scream and Scream VI respectively in 2022 and 2023. This year the duo helmed the Universal vampire comedy, Abigail. Producers on part 2 are Tripp Vinson, Bradley J. Fischer, William Sherak, James Vanderbilt. EPs are Chad Villella, Tara Farney. Radio Silence is repped by UTA and Brillstein Entertainment Partners. Weaving, who is a Screen Actors Guild Award winner for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture with the ensemble of Searchlight Pictures’ Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, is repped by CAA and 111 Media.",
