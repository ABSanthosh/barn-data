  "text": "The Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse release date has shifted yet again, with Sony Pictures pushing back the release of the highly anticipated animated film. When is the new Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse release date? The Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse release date has been delayed by three weeks, with a new release set for June 25, 2027. The film was originally set to release on June 4, 2027, which itself was a new date following years of delays. According to a report from THR on the date shift, insiders note that the reason for the delay is to help its audience. With schools in summer break toward the end of June, this allows for more to see the movie. Late June is also said to be seen as a more “appealing” date internationally, according to THR. Christopher Miller, who is co-writing the film alongside Phil Lord and David Callaham, and has also been a writer on the two previous films, took to social media to also note that the film’s new release date gives it a better IMAX release window. With the delay, this now pushes Beyond the Spider-Verse to release more than four years after its predecessor, 2023’s Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. The movie was originally planned to be released on March 29, 2024; however, it was removed from Sony’s calendar in July 2023 due to delays from the writers and actors strikes. Following its initial delay, the film was thought to be planned for release sometime this year. However, a new report from Jeff Sneider of The InSneider in September 2024 said that the film was going to be delayed until 2027 due to production delays and the scheduling of other Spider-Man related content. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, the first film in the animated franchise, is currently available to stream on Fubo and FXNOW, while Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse can be viewed on Disney+ and Fubo.
