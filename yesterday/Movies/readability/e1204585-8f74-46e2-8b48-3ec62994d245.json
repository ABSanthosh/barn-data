  "text": "Disney has revealed a brand new Tron: Ares photo for the next installment to the long-running sci-fi action franchise. The photo provides fans with a closer look at Jared Leto‘s full black and red light suit. The film is scheduled to arrive in theaters on Friday, October 10, 2025. Its current theatrical release date will not be pitting the standalone sequel against any direct competition. However, it is still set to debut in the same month as high-profile movies like Lionsgate’s Michael Jackson biopic, Universal Pictures’ horror sequel The Black Phone 2, and Warner Bros.’ action fantasy sequel Mortal Kombat 2. Who is involved in Tron: Ares? Joining Leto in Tron: Ares is franchise vet Jeff Bridges, who will be reprising his role as Kevin Flynn, after over a decade since appearing in Tron: Legacy. The film will also star After Yang actor Jodie Turner-Smith, Past Lives breakout Greta Lee, Golden Globe winner Gillian Anderson, Emmy winner Evan Peters, Shameless alum Cameron Monaghan, and Yellowjackets star Sarah Desjardins. Production on the newest Tron sequel officially wrapped last May. Tron: Ares is being directed by Joachim Rønning (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil) from a screenplay written by Jesse Wigutow and Jack Thorne. Leto will reportedly play the titular character — a manifestation of a program that becomes sentient and crosses over into the human world. The film is produced by Emma Ludbrook, Jeffrey Springer, and Leto, with Russell Allen also serving as an executive producer. It will also feature music by Nine Inch Nails.",
