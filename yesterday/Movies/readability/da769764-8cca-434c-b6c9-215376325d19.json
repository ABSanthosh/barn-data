They discover that their father has left his estate to the Indigenous people of a remote hamlet in Northern Alberta. Determined to claim their fortune, the brothers return to the community, only to find it devastated by a cancer crisis tied to industrial development––a venture their father had once championed as Chief. Starring Adam Beach \u0026 Simon Baker as the brothers Adam \u0026 Ryan, with Graham Greene, Caren Moore, and Tanaya Beatty.

Reviews state that the film \"is a heartfelt and thought-provoking film about two brothers' emotional journey, exploring identity and cultural clashes.\" This looks really powerful. Here's the trailer (+ poster) for Sanjay Patel's film The Birds Who Fear Death, direct from YouTube: Adam and Ryan Spence, brothers motivated purely by financial gain, anxiously await the death of their father to claim the family restaurant business as inheritance. However, their plans take a shocking turn when they learn that William has left his estate to the Indigenous people of a remote hamlet in Northern Alberta. Determined to claim their fortune, they return to the community, only to find it devastated by a cancer crisis tied to industrial development––a venture their father had once championed as Chief. Tensions rise as the acting Chief blames William for the devastation, while the brothers seek alliances with others. When a deal falls through, chaos erupts, leading to a tragic confrontation with monumental and transformative consequences. The Birds Who Fear Death is both written and directed by the Indo-Canadian producer / filmmaker Sanjay Patel, director of the film Union Leader previously, plus one other short film. It's also produced by Sanjay Patel. This initially premiered at the 2024 Calgary Film Festival last year. Mongrel Media will debut Patel's The Birds Who Fear Death film in Canadian theaters starting on March 21st, 2025 coming soon. No US release date is set - stay tuned.
