  "text": "St. Denis Medical growing its audience in the week since it premiered on NBC, with the first episode up to 7.4M cross-platform viewers. That’s an 85% increase over the 4M that Nielsen reported live + same-day. The workplace comedy launched on NBC with two back-to-back episodes. NBCUniversal did not provide seven-day viewership insights for the second episode, but it did say that the second episode retained 82%, or roughly 3.3M, of the premiere’s L+SD audience. NBCUniversal also says the premiere episode is up to a 1.44 ratings in the key 18-49 demo, a 182% lift from the 0.51 it scored on its debut night. The first episode’s L+SD rating helped it rank not only as the top scripted program of the night, but also the highest-rated scripted broadcast series premiere without an NFL lead-in in nearly two years. Watch on Deadline St. Denis Medical is set at an underfunded, understaffed Oregon hospital where the dedicated doctors and nurses try their best to treat patients while maintaining their own sanity. The cast also includes Josh Lawson, Mekki Leeper, Kahyun Kim and Kaliko Kauahi. Spitzer and Ledgin write and executive produce. Simon Heuer also executive produces with director Ruben Fleischer (pilot only). Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group, produces in association with Spitzer Holding Company.",
