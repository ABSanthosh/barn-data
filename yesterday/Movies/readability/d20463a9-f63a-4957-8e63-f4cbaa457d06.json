Universal has released the official trailer for “Wicked: For Good,” the second part to 2024’s hit Broadway movie adaptation. “Wicked: For Good” brings back Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande as Elphaba and Glinda, as well as Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero, Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible, Jeff Goldblum as the Wizard of Oz, Ethan Slater as Boq Woodsman, Marissa Bode as Nessarose Thropp and Bowen Yang as Pfannee. Jon M. Chu directed both films with screenplays by Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox. Per the official logline, the second film — “set in the Land of Oz, before and after Dorothy Gale’s arrival from Kansas” — will “cover the events of the musical’s second act, following Elphaba and Glinda’s friendship being put to the test as they embrace their new respective identities as the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good Witch of the North, and how the consequences of their actions will change all of Oz forever.” Popular on Variety Last year’s “Wicked” was a massive hit and grossed $756 million at the worldwide box office, becoming the highest-grossing Broadway adaptation ever and Universal’s third biggest movie of all time. It received 10 Academy Award nominations, including best picture, lead actress for Erivo, supporting actress for Grande, costume design, editing, makeup and hairstyling, production design, original score, sound and visual effects. It won for costume design, making Paul Tazewell the first Black man to win the category, plus production design. “Wicked: For Good” is scheduled to be released in theaters on Nov. 21.
