  "text": "Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan and the rest of the “Thunderbolts*” stars are kicking even more ass in a special look at Marvel‘s upcoming film. The extended trailer debuted at the first-ever Brazil D23 fan event on Saturday. David Harbour, who plays Red Guardian in the film, was there to present the trailer to the audience. The Thunderbolts are essentially the answer to DC’s Suicide Squad — both are teams of villains and antiheroes forced to undergo dangerous missions for the good of mankind. In addition to Pugh, who reprises her “Black Widow” role of Yelena Belova, the cast includes Harbour, Stan as the Winter Soldier, Olga Kurylenko (Taskmaster from “Black Widow”), Hannah John-Kamen (Ghost from “Ant-Man and the Wasp”), Wyatt Russell (John Walker from “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier”) and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (as mastermind Valentina Allegra de Fontaine). “Top Gun: Maverick” star Lewis Pullman plays a mysterious character named Bob. Based on Kurt Busiek’s comic series of the same name, “Thunderbolts*” is directed by Jake Schreier, with Kevin Feige producing. Louis D’Esposito, Brian Chapek, Jason Tamez and Scarlett Johansson serve as executive producers. The screenplay is written by Eric Pearson (“Black Widow,” “Thor: Ragnarok,” “Transformers One,” “The Fantastic Four: First Steps”), “Beef” creator Lee Sung Jin and co-showrunner of “The Bear” Joanna Calo. Popular on Variety Pullman told Variety that his audition for “Thunderbolts*” was so secretive, it was almost like meeting with the FBI. “It was a hell of an experience going out there and test screening. It felt like I was going into the FBI or something. It was all very locked and sealed. They’re like, ‘You’re lucky to hold onto a set of sides for longer than an hour.’ There were shredders everywhere. But Jake Schreier, the director, sat down with me and he told me the story, but I couldn’t read any script or anything. It was cool. It was kind of old fashioned in that sense. It was like, ‘And now by the campfire, I will tell you the story of Thunderbolts.’” The superhero tentpole is releasing in theaters on May 2, 2025. Watch the special look below.",
