  "text": "Some movie stars physically transform themselves for every new role, and some become so synonymous with a certain look that they bend each character to fit their preexisting appearance. Pedro Pascal is quickly establishing himself among the latter group, bringing his distinct pencil-thin mustache to roles as varied as post apocalyptic survivors, highly eligible bachelors, and small town mayors — the only thing that varies is the level of scruff in his beard. Don’t expect Pascal to go clean-shaven for a role any time soon. In a new appearance in one of LADbible’s “Agree to Disagree” videos alongside Vanessa Kirby (via Variety), Pascal explained that he remains insecure about his lack of facial hair in “Wonder Woman 1984.” The actor played Maxwell “Max Lord” Lorenzano, a sleazy businessman that he partially modeled on Michael Douglas’ performance in “Wall Street.” The clean-shaven look was appropriate for the character, but Pascal said that he was grateful that he was able to keep his facial hair for his return to comic book movies in this month’s “Fantastic Four: First Steps.” “I grow such shit facial hair, but if I were to shave it all off… I really look very [awful]. Strongly disagree with a clean shaven me,” Pascal said. “I was so appalled by the way I look in ‘Wonder Woman 1984.’ I loved the movie, but I was so appalled by the way that I looked that I never have gone back. Unless it were completely necessary. If they asked me to be clean shaven for ‘Fantastic Four’ and insisted then I would’ve done it. But it was a very collaborative creation for all of our looks in the movie.” A Marvel Studios release, “Fantastic Four: First Steps” opens in theaters on Friday, July 25. The film will mark the end of what has arguably been the craziest summer of Pascal’s career, as he played leading roles in three major films (the others being Celine Song’s “Materialists” and Ari Aster’s “Eddington”). “It is the best time of my life,” the actor said of his busy year in a recent interview with AP. “Just, I don’t know… look around, and it’s an incredible reflection of… what I’m experiencing right now. I’m having a really amazing time.”",
