  "text": "Polls have closed in North Carolina, Georgia and a few other states, as the nation awaits the results of a nail biter presidential election. The polls are also set to close at 8 p.m. in Pennsylvania and Michigan — both key swing states. The Associated Press called West Virginia, Kentucky and Indiana for Donald Trump, while Harris was projected to win Vermont. “No idea where tonight will go,” wrote Steve Kornacki, the MSNBC election analyst, on X. “Come on along and let’s find out together!” Anecdotal reports indicated heavy turnout across the country. Popular on Variety “Turnout is off the charts,” reported Jocelyn Benson, the Michigan secretary of state. “All across Michigan.” Both Harris and Trump spent a portion of the day calling in to radio stations in swing states urging voters to get to the polls. On Tuesday afternoon, Trump sent out an alarm about fraud in Philadelphia on Truth Social. “A lot of talk about massive CHEATING in Philadelphia. Law Enforcement coming!!!” he wrote. “Philadelphia and Detroit! Heavy Law Enforcement is there!!!” Bomb threats were called in to some polling locations in the Atlanta area, causing some to temporarily close. In Fulton County, five polling locations were expected to be held open a little beyond 7 p.m. Harris stopped by the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington on Tuesday afternoon, where she thanked volunteers who were phone-banking, and spoke briefly to voters. “I am well,” she said over the phone, according to a pool report. “Have you voted already? You did? Thank you!” Trump voted in Florida on Tuesday morning, saying he felt “very confident” about the outcome. “We went in with a very big lead today, and it looks like Republicans have shown up in force,” he said. Ballot counting could take several days, particularly in Arizona and Nevada. “Let the process run its course,” said former President Obama on X. “It takes time to count every ballot.”",
