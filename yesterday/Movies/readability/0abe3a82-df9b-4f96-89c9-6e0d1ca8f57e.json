  "text": "The Spider-Man 4 release date has been slightly delayed by Sony Pictures for the highly anticipated fourth entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. When is the new Spider-Man 4 release date? Sony announced today that the Spider-Man 4 release date is now set for July 31, 2026. That’s a week’s delay from the original date of July 24, 2026. This puts the film’s release almost three months after Avengers: Doomsday, which is also rumored to feature Tom Holland as Spider-Man in some capacity as well. While not too much is known about Spider-Man 4, Holland did reveal a bit about the movie this past week. In a recent round of visits to various talk shows, Holland said that it will be “different” from what fans may think. In September, Destin Daniel Cretton was in negotiations to direct Spider-Man 4, taking over for Jon Watts, who helmed the previous three Holland-led superhero entries. Cretton is best known for directing Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Cretton was tapped to direct Avengers: The Kang Dynasty but exited the project shortly before Jonathan Majors’ firing from Marvel. With the films officially dated and what we know so far, Marvel Studios’ upcoming theatrical slate of films looks like the following: Thunderbolts* – May 2, 2025 The Fantastic Four: First Steps – July 25, 2025 Avengers: Doomsday – May 1, 2026 Spider-Man 4: July 31, 2026 Avengers: Secret Wars – May 7, 2027",
