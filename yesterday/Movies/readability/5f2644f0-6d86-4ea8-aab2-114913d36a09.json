  "text": "Scarlett Johansson recently opened up about her most challenging film role during an interview. While promoting her latest project, Jurassic World Rebirth, the actress revealed which movies proved toughest to film as she reflected on clips from her notable works. The Black Widow star shared that her experience of working with Joaquin Phoenix in the 2013 film Her was one of the most challenging experiences. In her latest appearance on the South Korean show, You Quiz On the Block, Scarlett Johansson detailed why Her seemed like one of the toughest projects that she was a part of. She explained, “It was one of the hardest films that we made because it was complicated.” Johansson further shared how they recorded her voice in the film. “Sometimes I would record with [Joaquin Phoenix], sometimes I would record to the movie and do his performance… I would record to the movie,” Johansson added. Johansson gushed, “It’s interesting because as an actor, you have your voice, obviously, and you have your body. Those are the two tools you have to perform, and when you take one of those tools away, obviously you don’t have your physicality; it’s an interesting kind of challenge.” In Spike Jonze’s directorial, Johansson portrays the role of Samantha, an artificially intelligent operating system. In the entire movie, viewers could only hear her voice and not see her. So, the Fly Me to the Moon star revealed how the voice acting role proved challenging. In another interview, Scarlett Johansson also shared a different sort of tough experience for the 2003 film, Lost in Translation, which earned her a BAFTA Award for Best Actress. She dished to Vanity Fair about her co-star Bill Murray being in a “hard place” while the filming went on. Johansson noted, “Bill was in a hard place. Everybody was on tenterhooks around him, including our director and the full crew, because he was dealing with his…stuff.” Later, she met Murray at Saturday Night Live’s 50th-anniversary special. Johansson revealed that her former co-star is “such a different person now.” She added, “I think life has humbled him.”",
