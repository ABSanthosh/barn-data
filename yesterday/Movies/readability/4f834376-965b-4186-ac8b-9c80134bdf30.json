  "text": "Zachary Levi‘s recent comments about Gavin Creel’s passing have sparked widespread backlash in the Broadway community. His remarks, hinting at a connection between Creel’s illness and recent events, have reignited a longstanding debate around health and personal beliefs. Known for speaking his mind, Levi’s statements have brought new attention to an already sensitive topic. What did Zachary Levi say, and how have others responded? Let’s explore the details. Zachary Levi faces intense backlash after implying that fellow Broadway actor Gavin Creel, who recently passed away from a rare form of sarcoma, died due to the COVID-19 vaccine. Levi, known for his anti-vaccine stance, made controversial claims during a politically charged Instagram Live session (via Entertainment Weekly). He suggested that Gavin Creel’s cancer, which he labeled “turbo cancer,” was influenced by vaccine mandates. This statement drew significant criticism from the Broadway community, who condemned Levi for politicizing Creel’s passing to promote his anti-vaccine views. Among those speaking out, actors Norbert Leo Butz and Jenna Leigh Green expressed their disappointment and anger. They emphasized that Levi’s comments were disrespectful to Creel’s memory. Butz shared that he felt “heartbroken” over Levi using Creel’s life to push a controversial stance. Green and others argued that Gavin deserved a tribute free from any agenda. The American Cancer Society and National Cancer Institute also discredited Levi’s claims. They reiterated that there is no scientific link between COVID-19 vaccines and cancer. In the aftermath, Levi maintained his beliefs. He urged critics to consider the possibility of being wrong. He stated he would not be “shamed” into changing his stance or political beliefs, which include supporting Donald Trump. Levi’s remarks have deepened divisions with his Broadway peers. Many feel he disregarded both scientific evidence and Creel’s legacy. They believe he spread unfounded fears about the vaccine. The controversy has prompted calls for a respectful commemoration of Creel, with a focus on his talents and contributions to the arts, unclouded by political or conspiratorial narratives.",
