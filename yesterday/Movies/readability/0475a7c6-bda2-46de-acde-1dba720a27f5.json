  "description": "\"Are you done?\" \"No. I want 'em all.\" Oh damn. 20th Century Studios has debuted a new 60-second promo trailer for The Amateur, the intense revenge movie from British director James Hawes (who also directed a bunch of episodes of spy series \"Slow Horses\" as well). This is opening in April - and the only other trailer so far debuted last year. Glad to finally see something new for this, we've been waiting for more marketing material. The film follows a nerdy CIA cryptographer / software guy who is able to blackmail his own agency into training him to let him go after a group of terrorist who killed his wife in London. He realizes his bosses will not act due to conflicting internal priorities, so he takes things into his own hands. Rami Malek stars as Charles Heller, with Rachel Brosnahan, Caitríona Balfe, Jon Bernthal, Michael Stuhlbarg, Holt McCallany, Julianne Nicholson, Adrian Martinez, Danny Sapani, and Laurence Fishburne. I so want to see this! Malek looks seriously pissed off and I'm all for him getting revenge! Do it! In theaters soon.

I so want to see this! Malek looks seriously pissed off and I'm all for him getting revenge! Do it! In theaters soon. Here's the \"Only In Theaters\" promo trailer for James Hawes' thriller The Amateur, direct from YouTube: You can view the first official trailer for James Hawes' The Amateur movie right here for even more footage. Charlie Heller (Rami Malek) is a brilliant, but deeply introverted decoder for the CIA working out of a basement office at headquarters in Langley whose life is turned upside down when his wife is killed in a London terrorist attack. When his supervisors refuse to take action, he takes matters into his own hands, embarking on a dangerous trek across the globe to track down those responsible, his intelligence serving as the ultimate weapon for eluding his pursuers and achieving his revenge. The Amateur is directed by award-winning British filmmaker James Hawes, director of many TV movies including A Line in the Sand, The Chatterley Affair, The Lift, Miss Marie Lloyd, The 39 Steps, Enid, Pulse, and The Challenger Disaster previously, plus for the series \"Snowpiercer\", \"Slow Horses\", and the Anthony Hopkins film One Life most recently. The screenplay is written by Ken Nolan and Gary Spinelli; based on the novel by Robert Littell. Produced by Hutch Parker, Dan Wilson, Rami Malek, and Joel B. Michaels. 20th Century will debut Hawes' The Amateur in theaters nationwide starting April 11th, 2025 next spring. Look any good? Who's down? Find more posts in: To Watch, Trailer",
