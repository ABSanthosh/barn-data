  "text": "President Donald Trump said he “couldn’t care less” if international automakers increase pricing due to his 25% tariffs on all foreign-made auto parts and imported vehicles announced several days ago. The move — which was was censured by foreign automakers and leaders and led to the fall of shares in stocks for companies like General Motors and Ford, per the Associated Press — escalated tensions in a looming trade war. The American Automotive Policy Council representing domestic automakers said in a statement that “it is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector.” In a sprawling interview with NBC News, Trump maintained: “The message is congratulations, if you make your car in the United States, you’re going to make a lot of money. If you don’t, you’re going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff.” Watch on Deadline Asked whether he had convened U.S. auto industry CEOs to tell them not to raise prices, as The Wall Street Journal reported, Trump responded, “No, I never said that. I couldn’t care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars. I couldn’t care less. I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars. We have plenty.” He concluded, “No, I couldn’t care less, because if the prices on foreign cars go up, they’re going to buy American cars.” As reported previously, foreign auto parts assembled domestically would still see a 25% tax. Companies that import vehicles under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the free trade agreement established during the first Trump era, will remain tariff-free until the government establishes a process for levying the taxes, the White House said. When questioned if there was “room for negotiation” on the expected April 2 tariffs, Trump answered, “Only if people are willing to give us something of great value. Because countries have things of great value, otherwise, there’s no room for negotiation.”",
