  "description": "\"Come on, isn't it obvious? So who you after, sheriff?\" Dark Star Pictures has unveiled the official trailer for Bone Face, an indie horror from filmmaker Michael Donovan Horn. This hasn't premiered at any festivals and will be released direct-to-VOD this month. A masked killer slasher horror mashed up with a whodunit mystery? So it seems. When a masked killer slaughters several campers, a sheriff \u0026 deputy track a murderer to a local diner where, using their investigative skills, they must discover which person in the diner is the actual killer. \"An engaging cocktail of slasher, thriller, and whodunnit with a superb cast... genre audiences will find something to love here.\" The film stars Jeremy London and Elena Sanchez as the small-town sheriff and deputy, with Alli Hart, Miles Doleac, Jared Bankens, Ritchie Montgomery, Escalante Lundy, and Madison Wolfe. This doesn't seem that interesting - my guess is the mask takes over people. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Michael Donovan Horn's horror film Bone Face, from YouTube: \"Who wears the mask?\" ðŸ‘¹ When a masked killer slaughters several counselors at a small-town summer camp, Sheriff Vince Cronin and Deputy Jo McCully track the murderer to a local diner [â€¦]",
