  "description": "\"We're kinda different... I bet you can't guess how!\" Can you guess how this little guy is different? There's just something that seems a little off about him... But I can't tell what it is! He looks pretty normal to me. Enjoy this especially funny animated short film called We're Kinda Different, created and directed by the animation filmmaker Ben Meinhardt based up in BC, Canada. He's been working in animation for two decades so far, creating cartoons and more. The characters in this film are created by his son, who drew this picture of Mr. Butt Face (or is it Ms.?) and a new character was born. Ben took this one-of-a-kind creation and turned it into a 3-minute cartoon musical which is now online for everyone to enjoy. It played at a few film festivals earlier this year, including at the Ottawa Animation Festival \u0026 Waco Film Festival in TX, and now it's on YT and Vimeo. As much fun as this character is, it's actually a wholesome little film about not caring about differences and appreciating exactly who you are \u0026 whatever makes you so unique. View below. Thanks to Vimeo Staff Picks for the tip on this [â€¦]",
