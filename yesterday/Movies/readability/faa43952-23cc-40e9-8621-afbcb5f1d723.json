  "text": "Isabella Rossellini knows why Edward Berger’s papal thriller “Conclave” inspires fervor. Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, the actress said she initially found the script “very interesting and very intellectual.” However, she said it was never claustrophobic thanks to the drama of “the Catholic Church and the church is so theatrical.” Rossellini grew up in Rome and said while the church has always had its controversies, she still sees it as a place where people from all over the world can come together. “Rome was a big capital, but very provincial at the time,” said Rossellini. “The Vatican was where you found bishops and nuns from the Philippines, from South America, from Africa. The universities and the Catholic schools were the ones that offered foreign languages and diversity. You had many different backgrounds, many different races, many different cultures. As a Roman, you always looked at the Vatican as a place of great international meeting.” Since they were shooting at Rome’s Cinecittà Studios, Rossellini and “Conclave” co-stars Stanley Tucci and John Lithgow traveled to the Vatican to get in the right mindset. She said that field trip let them comprehend the scale of the drama. “It was important because through the theatricality of the church, as I’ve said, you understand what they want to say,” Rossellini told the LA Times. “Through their representation in the church and the grandeur of the cathedral and the grandeur of St. Peter’s, it’s extraordinary and humbling. So many lives, so much history, all living the same doubts. And the church reminds you of that: Where do we go after death? The Catholic church tries to celebrate the mystery by embracing you in that.” “Conclave” is in theaters now from Focus Features.",
