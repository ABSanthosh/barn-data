  "text": "Even the most devoted Marvel fans may not know of starlet Jenna Ortega‘s role in the MCU — something the Death of a Unicorn actress recently reflected on as a seemingly one-and-done experience. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight alongside co-star Paul Rudd, the Scream actress responded to the reporter’s hopes of her joining the blockbuster franchise. “I did it once,” Ortega said of being in the MCU. “It was one of the first jobs I ever did. They took all my lines out. I’m in ‘Iron Man 3’ for a quick second. I take up the frame, I have one leg and I’m the vice president’s daughter.” When Rudd, who notably portrays Ant-Man in the ever-expanding universe, countered that “Marvel is very good at like, kind of laying those bread crumbs, and so it might very well be that you come back. That they are going to create something for you, cause they should be so lucky to have Jenna Ortega in their franchise,” Ortega wasn’t as assured. Watch on Deadline “They even took my name away. I count that, then I move on,” she said. But all’s well that ends well, since Ortega has gone on to star in You, The Fallout, Wednesday, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice and X. Next up, she’ll be in the second season of the hit Netflix show centering on the macabre Addams family teen daughter, as well as Taika Waititi‘s adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro‘s novel Klara and the Sun. Ortega will also be in The Weeknd’s debut feature, Hurry Up Tomorrow, and future roles in talks include a Single White Female remake, The Gallerist opposite Natalie Portman and an as-yet untitled J.J. Abrams project.",
