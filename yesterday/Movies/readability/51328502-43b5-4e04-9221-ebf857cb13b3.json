  "text": "Deadpool co-creator Rob Liefeld had something to say about Marvel Studios‘ Kevin Feige after seeing the box office results of Captain America: Brave New World. The post-Avengers: Endgame era at the box office has been challenging for Marvel, with only a few exceptions like Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine. Box office results for the second weekend of Captain America: Brave New World showed a 68% drop week-to-week, positioning it as the third most significant drop in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The two films that fared worse were The Marvels, with a 78% dropoff, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, with a 68% dropoff. Following the report of Brave New World’s results, Liefeld took to X (the microblogging platform formerly known as Twitter) and posted, “Get Feige off the mound.

Marvel brand is like Dodgers, Lakers, Yankees, Celtics, coaches that win championships are removed a year later when the results are disappointing.” In another X post he added, “8 movies crash over the last 3 years. Don’t we want better movies? You get the curiosity crowd then plunge.” As shared by @ScottMendelson, MCU is on an extended downside. This is beyond a trend, it’s become the norm.
