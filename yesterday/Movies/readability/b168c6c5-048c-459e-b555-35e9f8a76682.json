  "text": "The 30th annual Critics Choice Awards are underway Friday at Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, launching a ceremony that had twice been postponed due to the L.A. wildfires that wreaked havoc on the city the past month. Chelsea Handler returns to host. Already, Conclave, the Focus Features drama that came in tied with Universal’s Wicked with the most nominations overall with 11, won the night’s first award, for Best Ensemble. Universal/DreamWorks Animation’s The Wild Robot won for Best Animated Film. On the TV side so far, FX’s Emmy juggernaut Shōgun, which led the way with six nominations coming in, won both Supporting Actor and Supporting Actress categories. Watch on Deadline Colin Farrell, who transferred his Oswald Cobblepot from the big to the small screen for HBO | Max’s The Penguin, won for Best Actor in a Limited Series, while his co-star Cristin Milioti won for Best Actress. Check out the winners list below for the 21 movie and 20 TV categories in play and keep checking back as we update it throughout the evening. After Conclave and Wicked, Dune: Part Two and Emilia Pérez have 10 noms apiece for a ceremony that traditionally has served as a good Oscar bellwether. Last year, eventual Best Picture Oscar winner Oppenheimer scored a leading eight wins including the marquee Best Picture prize. Conclave, Wicked, Dune: Part Two and Emilia Pérez are nominated in Critics Choice Best Pic category this year alongside A Complete Unknown, Anora, The Brutalist, Nickel Boys, Sing Sing and The Substance. All but Sing Sing are up for the same award at the Oscars. On the TV side after Shōgun, ABC’s Abbott Elementary, Apple TV+’s Disclaimer, HBO | Max’s Hacks and The Penguin, Netflix’s The Diplomat and the final season of FX’s What We Do in the Shadows all have four noms coming in. This year’s Critics Choice Awards are airing live on the East Coast at 7 p.m. ET, and be tape delayed in the West until 7 p.m. PT on E! in the debut of a new deal with the network and Peacock.
