  "description": "\"Wasn't it weird?\" \"It felt good. It was actually pretty mind-blowing.\" Strand Releasing has unveiled the official US trailer for Sex, the next film in Norwegian director Dag Johan Haugerud's series of films known as the Oslo Trilogy. This has the most provocative title of the 3 films (obviously), though it's a rather tame film without any actual sex in it at all – only conversations about the act of having sex. Sex is the first part of the trilogy Sex Dreams Love (watch the trailer for Love here). These three freestanding films by Dag Johan Haugerud all revolve around desire, identity, and the longing for freedom. In this one – two chimney sweeps living in monogamous, heterosexual marriages both end up in situations that will challenge their views on sexuality. Sex is a warm, inquiring drama about how intimacy \u0026 freedom operate in modern relationships \u0026 gender roles. Staring Jan Gunnar Røise and Thorbjørn Haar, along with Siri Forberg and Brigitte Larsen. For anyone who enjoys having intellectual conversations, although it's not the most cinematic film.

Here's the official US trailer (+ new US poster) for Dag Johan Haugerud's film Sex, direct from YouTube: Two men, both in heterosexual marriages, have an unexpected experience challenging them to reconsider their understanding of sexuality, gender, and identity. One has a sexual encounter with a man, without considering it as an expression of homosexuality or infidelity, and discusses it with his wife afterwards. The other finds himself in nocturnal dreams where he is seen as a woman, stirring confusion and leading him to question how much his personality is shaped by the gaze of others. Sex, originally known as Sex in Norwegian, is written and directed by Norwegian filmmaker Dag Johan Haugerud, director of the films The 7 Deadly Sins, I Belong, I'm the One You Want, Barn, and The Light from the Chocolate Factory, plus many other shorts and cinema projects. Part of his \"The Oslo Trilogy\" (featuring Love, Sex, Dreams). It's produced by Hege Hauff Hvattum and Yngve Sæther. This first premiered at the 2024 Berlin Film Festival last year. Strand Releasing opens Haugerud's Sex film in select US theaters (at Film Forum in NYC) starting June 13th, 2025. Along with Love on May 16th \u0026 Dreams on September 12th coming soon. Intrigued?
