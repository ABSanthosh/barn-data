  "text": "Aleska Génesis was not only evicted from Telemundo‘s La Casa de los Famosos All Stars but also arrested and taken into custody by police after viewers voted her out. It doesn’t get more real than what happened to Aleska on Monday night’s shock eviction from the reality series competition. After 35 days on the show, the Venezuelan model didn’t survive the nominations block and became the fifth evicted housemate. However, minutes after Aleska was to have a sit-down interview with the show’s co-host, Jimena Gállego, to talk about her time in the house, she was approached by Mexican police because she had an arrest warrant in her name. Aleska was arrested on suspicion of robbery, something she had been arrested for in the past, before entering La Casa de los Famosos Season 4 in 2024. The former model is accused of taking part in the robbery of expensive watches and was taken into custody when she landed in Mexico City to take part in the reality competition. She was released shortly after and appeared on the Telemundo show where she came in sixth place. iHeartRadio Podcast Awards 2025 La Casa de los Famosos All Stars viewers tuned into the Telemundo competition to find out if Aleska would appear on the show but her seat remained empty. Host Javier Poza and Gállego shared video of Aleska’s arrest moments after her eviction from the house. Based on the Celebrity Big Brother format, the show brings a group of high-profile personalities in a house and shuts them out entirely from the outside world. The show is expected to bend the rules and tell Aleska’s former housemates what happened to her following her eviction, which will shock close allies Lupillo Rivera and Luca Onestini, who has not taken her eviction well.",
