  "text": "Jenny Han’s empire of YA literary adaptations will further expand with the newest season of Netflix’s XO, Kitty based on the character from Han’s beloved To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before trilogy. Renewed for a second season shortly after its May 2023 debut on the streamer, the series follows Katherine “Kitty” Song Covey, younger sister to Lana Condor’s Lara Jean Song Covey from Han’s books and the Netflix movie trilogy, as she embarks on a yearlong study abroad program at the Korean International School of Seoul, where her mother attended school. Kitty makes her fair share of mistakes and close friendships at KISS, where she realizes she doesn’t know as much about love as she thought. For all the details including release date, cast and everything we know about XO, Kitty Season 2, read on. Watch on Deadline When does XO, Kitty Season 2 come out? Season 2 of XO, Kitty arrives January 16, 2025. Who is in the cast of XO, Kitty Season 2? Anna Cathcart returns as Kitty Song Covey, as do Minyeong Choi who plays Dae Kim, Gia Kim who plays Yuri Han, Sang Heon Lee as Min Ho Moon, Anthony Keyvan as Q and Regan Aliyah as Juliana. More returning cast includes Peter Thurnwald as Alex, Jocelyn Shelfo as Madison and Michael K. Lee as Professor Lee. RELATED: ‘XO, Kitty’ Season 2 Sets Release Date; First Look Photos Newcomers for Season 2 include  Audrey Huynh, Joshua Lee and Sasha Bhasin. Philippe Lee will also play a new character this season, Mr. Moon. What is XO, Kitty Season 2 about? In Season 2, Kitty will return to KISS for a brand new semester in South Korea, a clean slate. She hopes to not meddle, matchmake or cause any more drama for her friend group. A mysterious letter from her mother’s past sends her into another investigation, and she soon learns she doesn’t know everything about family, life and love. What happened in XO, Kitty Season 1? Season 1 of the show watched Kitty convince her father, Dr. Covey (John Corbet) and his new wife Trina Rothschild (Sarayu Blu) that she should study abroad for her junior year of high school. Her two motivations for going to KISS are her long distance boyfriend Dae and the fact that her mother did the same program at the school he attends when she was in high school. From left: Anna Cathcart and Minyeong Choi in ‘XO, Kitty’ Season 1 Kitty surprises Dae at KISS, which is to their detriment, because he is fake dating Yuri (Gina Kim) because she is lesbian and doesn’t want her parents to now. Kitty comes crashing into KISS thinking they are together for real, but they eventually figure everything out — until she realizes she has feelings for Yuri. Oh, and Min Ho confesses his feelings for Kitty at the end of Season 1 as well. Talk about a love rhombus similar to Emily in Paris. Who else is behind XO, Kitty Season 2? Jessica O’Toole serves as showrunner, executive producer and writer on XO, Kitty Season 2. Jenny Han and Matt Kaplan of ACE Entertainment also serve as executive producers, and the show is produced through Awesomeness Studios.",
