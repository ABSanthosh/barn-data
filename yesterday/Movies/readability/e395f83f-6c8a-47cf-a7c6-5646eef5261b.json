  "text": "The Bear Season 4’s ending brings with it a lot of high-octane drama and even gives a glimpse at Carmy’s future, which has fans asking if Jeremy Allen White is indeed leaving the show. Even if it is not the case right away, Season 4’s cliffhanger final moments have confirmed that Carmy leaving the restaurant could be very much on the cards. He is only waiting for things to resolve before he goes. So, would Carmy leave the titular restaurant after The Bear Season 4? Here’s everything we’ve gathered. Is Jeremy Allen White’s Carmy leaving The Bear after Season 4? There has been nothing to suggest that the three-time Golden Globe award winner will be leaving after The Bear Season 4. However, in the fourth installment’s ending, Jeremy Allen White’s Carmy expresses his desire to quit after the restaurant is stable. After four seasons of intensive work that helped establish The Bear as a reputed restaurant in the first place, Carmy has realized that he doesn’t love being a chef anymore, and he does not understand himself outside the kitchen. Carmy has directly correlated his work to his brother’s death, or rather, used it as a way of avoiding the trauma from his brother’s death. Thus, he has also often projected his own shortcomings onto his work. That’s why Carmy even changed the partnership agreement to take his name off the contract and added Ritchie’s name instead. Of course, this does tease the possibility of Jeremy Allen White’s exit from The Bear, but not so soon. His character, Carmy, does say in Season 4 that he will depart after he has managed to stabilize the restaurant financially. Moreover, as things stand, there are still a lot of unresolved issues in the show’s storyline. So in all likelihood, Allen White will return in the fifth season, but that could be it for him. However, given that neither he nor the makers has indicated anything about the 34-year-old actor’s exit from the show. That said, The Bear has been one of the most unpredictable shows on television in recent years. So, it is yet to be seen whether the show will go on for more potential installments with or without Jeremy Allen White’s Carmy. Meanwhile, viewers can catch up on all the episodes of The Bear Seasons 1-4 on Hulu.",
