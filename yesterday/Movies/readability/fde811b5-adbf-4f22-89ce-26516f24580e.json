Along with Goya Toledo, Gabriela Andrada, Álex Béjar, Javier Morgade, and Felipe Londoño. This looks like Spain's 50 Shades of Grey mixed with Fast \u0026 Furious this time - adding in some car racing because why not. Here's the second official trailer for Domingo González's film Your Fault, direct from PV's YouTube: You can also rewatch the teaser trailer for Domingo González's Your Fault right here, for the first look. The love between Noah \u0026 Nick (Nicole Wallace \u0026 Gabriel Guevara returning again) seems unbreakable, despite the manoeuvres of their parents to break them up. But his job and her entry into college open their lives to new relationships. The appearance of a revenge-seeking ex-girlfriend as well as Nick's mother with unclear intentions will shake the foundations not only of their relationship, but of the Leister family itself. When so many people are out to destroy a love story, can it really end well? Your Fault, also known as Culpa Tuya in Spanish, is once again written and directed by Spanish filmmaker Domingo González, director of the first film My Fault previously, plus a few shorts and TV work. Produced by Pokeepsie Films, Álex de la Iglesia, \u0026 Carolina Bang. Amazon will debut Culpa Tuya (Your Fault) streaming on Prime Video worldwide starting on December 27th, 2024 during the holiday season later this year. Anyone into this?
