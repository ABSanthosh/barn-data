  "description": "\"She's a fighter.\" \"I underestimated you.\" Netflix has unveiled an official trailer for an action thriller movie called Exterritorial, made by German filmmaker Christian Zübert. Ready for release on Netflix at the end of April - for anyone who wants to take a look. Maybe it'll be entertaining? When a former Special Forces soldier's son vanishes without a trace at the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany, she illegally remains on the premises to search for him, unknowingly entangling herself in a dangerous conspiracy. She embarks on a nerve-wracking search for her son. The title Exterritorial is a word that means \"existing or taking place outside the territorial limits of a jurisdiction.\" Obviously enough. Exterritorial stars Jeanne Goursaud as Sara, with Dougray Scott, Lera Abova, Kayode Akinyemi, \u0026 Annabelle Mandeng. This looks super cheesy and so generic, yet another Netflix streaming action movie that'll be forgotten a week after it debuts. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Christian Zübert's action movie Exterritorial, from YouTube: On a visit to the US consulate in Frankfurt, the young son of former Special Forces soldier Sara (Jeanne Goursaud) disappears without a trace. Stranger still, nobody seems to remember him ever being in the building. […]",

Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Christian Zübert's action movie Exterritorial, from YouTube: On a visit to the US consulate in Frankfurt, the young son of former Special Forces soldier Sara (Jeanne Goursaud) disappears without a trace. Stranger still, nobody seems to remember him ever being in the building. Sara knows that the German authorities have no jurisdiction inside the consulate, and if she's forced to leave now, she might never see her son again – so she stays on the premises. Sara moves deeper into the labyrinth of the consulate, desperately searching for her son, unaware of the growing danger of a dark conspiracy around her. Exterritorial is written and directed by German writer / filmmaker Christian Zübert, director of the movies Lammbock, Hardcover, Three Quarter Moon, Tour de Force, One Breath, Lommbock, and episodes of \"Arthurs Gesetz\", \"Bad Banks\", \"The Mopes\" series most recently. Produced by Götz Marx, Kerstin Schmidbauer, Franziska Suppee, Verena Vogl. Netflix will debut Zübert's Exterritorial movie streaming on Netflix starting April 30th, 2025 coming soon. Look any good?
