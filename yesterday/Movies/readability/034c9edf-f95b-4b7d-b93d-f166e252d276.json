  "description": "\"Don't let them pull you off that horse...\" Sony Pictures at Home has revealed the trailer for a contemporary western movie called Broke, arriving to watch at home in May. This one is skipping theaters entirely, going direct to VOD to watch soon. Broke is a modern western family drama telling the story of True Brandywine, a bareback buckin' bronco rider clinging to his fading rodeo career. When he gets trapped in a freak spring blizzard, he must battle injuries, illness, and the bitter cold. While fighting for his survival, True is forced to face his choices and the circumstances that led him to his tenuous situation. Filmed on location entirely in Montana. Starring Wyatt Russell as True, Auden Thornton, Mary McDonnell, Johnny Berchtold, with Tom Skerrit and Dennis Quaid. This looks gritty with a tough \u0026 rumble spirit following these guys as they try to make sense of their life and their decisions. Worth a watch if you're into the rodeo way of life. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Carlyle Eubank's film Broke, direct from Sony's YouTube: Directed by Carlyle Eubank, Broke is a contemporary western following the story of True Brandywine (Wyatt Russell), a bareback bronc [â€¦]",
