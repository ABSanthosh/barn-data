  "text": "President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Karoline Leavitt as White House press secretary. Leavitt was the national press secretary during Trump’s recent campaign, and served as assistant press secretary in the first term. At age 27, Leavitt will be the youngest White House press secretary in history. Trump said in a statement, “Karoline Leavitt did a phenomenal job as the National Press Secretary on my Historic Campaign, and I am pleased to announce she will serve as White House Press Secretary. Karoline is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator. I have the utmost confidence she will excel at the podium, and help deliver our message to the American People as we, Make America Great Again.” The role is especially scrutinized under Trump, who went through four press secretaries in his first term: Sean Spicer, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Stephanie Grisham and Kayleigh McEnany.  Watch on Deadline RELATED : RFK Jr Boot Licks Trump For “Courage” In HHS Secretary Nomination",
