Now, their effortless chemistry on the red carpet sparked discourse regarding their cherished camaraderie among netizens. So, here’s everything fans need to know about Pascal and Paulson’s equation over the past several years. Is Pedro Pascal friends with Sarah Paulson? The Last of Us actor has been friends with the Golden Globe-winning actress since the 90s. In a 2014 chat with Interview magazine, Pedro Pascal and Sarah Paulson revealed how they bonded in New York City after he moved to the Big Apple. He shared that he met her in September 1993, his “first month in New York City.” Pascal recalled, “I was really lucky because my first friend at NYU lived in Brooklyn, Kristen, and went to high school with you, so your guys’ posse kind of adopted me.” He went on to describe how the two, both 18-year-olds, met with a few different people and went to watch the movie Fearless. Afterward, a fan moment with Woody Harrelson at a park forged their lifelong bond. Pascal and Paulson also talked about their “period of estrangement” as she moved to Los Angeles for work. They reconnected when The Fantastic Four: First Steps star shifted there a few years later. Furthermore, Pedro Pascal and Sarah Paulson revealed to Esquire how she helped him through hard times. She stated, “He’s talked about this publicly, but there were times when I would give him my per diem from a job I was working on so that he could have money to feed himself.”  Not just that, Paulson helped Pascal land his breakthrough role as Oberyn Martell in Game of Thrones. Per Vanity Fair, she forwarded his audition tape to her friend Amanda Peet, whose husband, David Benioff, was the show’s co-creator. Since then, both Pascal and the Ratched actress have achieved stardom and become household names. However, the two pals continue to meet once in a while and are often spotted attending numerous award ceremonies together. Additionally, Paulson and Pascal periodically share Instagram posts for each other’s birthdays and other occasions. The actress even appeared in a Saturday Night Live sketch with her dear friend in February 2023 to support him. Recently, Sarah Paulson also divulged to Vanity Fair a side of Pedro Pascal that fans don’t get to see. The 50-year-old actress said, “No one was more fun. But he was also sad. There’s a well of pain that lives right behind his eyes.” As the two actors continue their three-decade-long friendship, fans cannot help but gush at the same.",
