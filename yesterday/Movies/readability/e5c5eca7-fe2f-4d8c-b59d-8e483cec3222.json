  "text": "Fast-food giant McDonald’s is always looking to extend its presence in the market, with the McValue Menu becoming its latest addition to attract customers. The multinational restaurant chain consistently adopts captivating and trending tactics to increase its consumer base, including collaborating with film franchises and revamping its roster. In a similar fashion, McDonald’s has now launched a McValue Menu that allows shoppers to purchase its food items at a lower price. Here’s everything you need to know about what the McValue platform actually entails. The most significant aspect of the McValue Menu is that it enables customers to add certain items to their order at a highly discounted rate. Under the “Buy One, Add One for $1” deal, customers can purchase their favorite servings for just $1, provided they have already ordered an item from the McValue Menu at its original price. The McDonald’s items included in this offer are split into two categories: McValue breakfast Buy One, Add One for $1 menu items: Sausage McMuffin Sausage Biscuit Sausage Burrito Hash Browns McValue lunch/dinner Buy One, Add One for $1 menu items: 6-piece Chicken McNuggets Double Cheeseburger McChicken Small Fries Another feature of the newly introduced McValue Menu is the $5 Meal Deal. While this offer is not entirely new, it has now been included under the McValue Menu, with McDonald’s also extending its validity period. By ordering a $5 Meal Deal, customers will get a packaged meal containing their choice of a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, Small Fries, 4-piece Chicken McNuggets, and a small soft drink. Customers can access the McValue Menu by visiting their nearest McDonald’s establishment or through the MyMcDonald’s app. In addition to the offers mentioned above, the McValue Menu also includes several app-exclusive and location-specific deals. Interested buyers can take advantage of these cost-effective offerings starting today, January 7, 2025. However, it currently remains unclear when the McValue Menu will expire.",
