  "description": "\"We just drop her off and go...\" Abramorama has released the main official trailer for an indie film called Wayward, marking the feature directorial debut of writer / filmmaker Jacquelyn Frohlich. This one first premiered at the 2023 Deauville Film Festival last year, but is only now getting released - starting in a very select number of theaters this fall. Wayward follows eleven-year-old Cleo who becomes enchanted with the charismatic female hitchhiker who her mother picks up as they drive to their new home in Los Angeles from Idaho. When Cleo and the hitchhiker form an unlikely bond, the line between kidnapping and running away becomes dangerously blurred. The mom is played by Jess Weixler, along with Chloe Guidry as Cleo, plus Jessica Sula, Rob Morrow, Will Brittian, and Colleen Camp. An intriguing little story showing both sides of a kidnapping situation, along with this tale of a young girl feeling the need to escape her own mom. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Jacquelyn Frohlich's film Wayward, direct from YouTube: While mov­ing from Ida­ho to Los Ange­les with her moth­er, 11-year-old Cleo (Chloe Guidry), who is yearn­ing for sta­bil­i­ty in her life, becomes smit­ten with a charis­mat­ic female […]",

As she detaches more and more from her mother, the girl forms an unlikely bond with the hitchhiker, blurring the line between running away and kidnapping. Wayward is written and directed by the up-and-coming Colombian filmmaker Jacquelyn Frohlich, making her feature directorial debut after a few other short films previously; she also wrote many novels before.
