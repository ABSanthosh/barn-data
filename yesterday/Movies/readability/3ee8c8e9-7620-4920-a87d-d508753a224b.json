Or just wait to see this in theaters next month. Here's the official trailer for Samir Oliveros' film The Luckiest Man In America, from IFC's YouTube: \"What's behind his winning streak?\" Based on a true story, The Luckiest Man In America is set in May 1984, when an unemployed ice cream truck driver from Ohio (Paul Walter Hauser) steps onto the game show Press Your Luck harboring a big secret: the key to endless amounts of money. His winning streak is threatened when the bewildered executives in the control room start to uncover his real motivations. The Luckiest Man In America is directed by Colombian indie filmmaker Samir Oliveros, making his second feature film after directing Bad Lucky Goat (2017) previously, and a few other short films. The screenplay is written by Maggie Briggs and Samir Oliveros. Produced by Amanda Freedman. This initially premiered at the 2024 Toronto Film Festival last year but didn't play anywhere else. IFC Film will release Oliveros' The Luckiest Man In America film in select US theaters starting on April 4th, 2025 coming soon. Interested? Find more posts in: Indies, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
