Walkthroughs, and Megastructures: Real Madrid Super Stadium. On July 17, America’s Funniest Home Videos Seasons 13-15 will premiere on the streaming platform. It will have a total of 67 episodes. The show features home videos sent by viewers involving comical situations, ranging from blunders to stage pranks. Further, the audience in the studio casts their votes for the funniest videos that end up receiving attractive prizes. Also coming out on Disney+ are Disneyland Resort P.O.V. Walkthroughs. Disney will be celebrating its theme park’s 70th anniversary in a special way. They will be releasing some special videos similar to the point-of-view experience of Rise Of The Resistance and Galaxy’s Edge that took place at Disneyland Resort in California. These special videos are a homage to Disney’s storytelling and authenticity in a cinematic experience like never before. Additionally, the documentary Megastructures: Real Madrid Super Stadium drops on the streaming platform. It unfolds the massive transformation of the stadium into a more technically advanced place. This includes a withdrawn roof, a 360-degree video scoreboard, and an underground pitch storage system. Additionally, the show will witness the advanced engineering and designs of the renovation and how the stadium will continue to host matches irrespective of the construction.
