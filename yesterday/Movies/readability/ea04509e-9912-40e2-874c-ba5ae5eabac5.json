  "description": "\"I'm going to do everything I can to find your mother.\" Signature Entertainment in the UK has revealed an official trailer for an indie border drama titled Beyond the Borders, made by filmmaker Marco Perego. This was already released in the US last year under the original title The Absence of Eden (we posted the first trailer a year ago) and it's just now getting a VOD release in the UK as well. The harrowing film traces the sprawling romance between a man and a woman whose love for each other struggles to prevail amid the divisiveness of life on America's border with Mexico. This story is more timely than ever, although this also premiered back in 2023. It explores the humanity of immigration and the fragility of life as an immigration agent unknowingly dooms a former lover and a woman struggles to escape her past. Zoe Saldana stars as a woman who flees across the border, and helps protect a young girl. The cast includes Garrett Hedlund, Adria Arjona, Tom Waits, and Chris Coy. Films about the border and how horrible Americans are down there are important, but it's probably not going to change much despite good intentions \u0026 […]",

Here's the official UK trailer (+ new poster) for Marco Perego's film Beyond the Borders, from YouTube: You can also view the other US trailer for Marco Perego's The Absence of Eden right here for more footage. Marco Perego's film The Absence of Eden takes place at the border between the United States and Mexico – a hellish landscape inhabited by coyotes, armed officers, many desperate immigrants, and refugees. When Esmee (Zoe Saldaña), a young woman working as a private dancer in Mexico, is forced to commit a violent act of self-defense that results in the death of a cartel member, she must flee her homeland to find sanctuary in the United States. Guided by a ruthless Coyote and a group of undocumented immigrants, she befriends a young mother and her daughter along the way. Before crossing the border, the mother is taken from the group, and Esmee promises to protect her daughter and help them reunite in America, touching off an interlocking story about the people struggling to survive on America’s border with Mexico. Beyond the Borders, originally known as The Absence of Eden is directed by Italian indie filmmaker Marco Perego, making his feature directorial debut with this film after producing a few other projects previously. The screenplay is also written by Marco Perego along with Rick Rapoza. It's produced by Karl Herrmann, Robert Kravis, Alexandra Milchan, Marco Perego, Zoe Saldana, Julie Yorn, and Rick Yorn. The film initially premiered at the 2023 Taormina Film Festival last year, and also played at the 2023 Newport Beach Film Festival. The film already opened in select US theaters in April last year (watch the trailer). Signature Ent. debuts Beyond the Borders direct-to-VOD in the UK on March 3rd, 2025 if anyone still wants to watch it. Find more posts in: Indies, To Watch, Trailer",
