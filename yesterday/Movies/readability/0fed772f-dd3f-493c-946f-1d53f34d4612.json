  "description": "\"One wrong move... and you just disappear.\" Well Go USA has unveiled the official trailer for a Thai action crime thriller film titled Bangkok Dog, the feature debut of director Chaya Supannarat. Another generic title that will get lost in the mix with everything else out there on VOD – this will be out to watch digitally in November. From the cast and stunt team behind the Oscar winner Everything Everywhere All At Once – an American agent is sent on a dangerous undercover mission in Thailand to dismantle a sadistic crime lord. As he works to gain the trust of higher-ups in the gang’s inner circle, the line between cop \u0026 criminal becomes increasingly blurred \"One agent. Two lives. No mercy.\" It's described as a \"high-octane martial arts thriller\" starring D.Y. Sao, Brian Le, Byron Bishop, Jenny Philomena Van Der Sluijs, as well as Sahajak Boontanakji. The main guy in here reminds me of Keno (Ernie Reyes Jr.) from TMNT II. This looks like it has some seriously kick ass fight scenes in it! Just hope the rest of the story lives up to the action. Fire it up. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Chaya Supannarat's Bangkok […]",

Fire it up. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Chaya Supannarat's Bangkok Dog, direct from YouTube: After intercepting a shipment of drugs from Thailand and discovering five dead bodies amidst the illicit cargo, special agent Andrew Kang (D.Y. Sao) arrests the international drug cartel’s Los Angeles-based operative (Brian Le) and impersonates him to go deep undercover in the Bangkok criminal underworld. But as he works to gain the trust of higher-ups in the gang’s inner circle, the line between cop and criminal becomes increasingly blurred, leaving him—and his agency—to wonder whether he’s gotten in too deep to ever make it out alive. Bangkok Dog is directed by Thai filmmaker Chaya Supannarat, making her first feature film after a few other short films previously. The screenplay is written by Laurence Walsh. Produced by Ariel Bleiberg, Ehud Bleiberg, Charles H. LaHaie, and D.Y. Sao. This initially premiered at the 2024 Big Bad Film Fest in Glendale, but hasn't shown anywhere else yet. Well Go USA debuts Supannarat's Bangkok Dog film direct-to-VOD in the US starting on November 12th, 2024 coming soon. Who wants to watch? Find more posts: Foreign Films, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
