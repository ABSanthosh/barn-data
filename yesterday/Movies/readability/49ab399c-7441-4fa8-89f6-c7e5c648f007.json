Dog Man is sworn to protect and serve‚Äîand fetch, sit and roll over. As Dog Man embraces his new identity and strives to impress his Chief (voiced by Lil Rel Howery), he must stop the pretty evil plots of feline supervillain Petey the Cat (Pete Davidson).

When Lil Petey falls into the clutches of a common enemy, Dog Man \u0026 Petey reluctantly join forces in an action-packed race against time to rescue the young kitten from evil.
