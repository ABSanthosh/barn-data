  "description": "\"One single injection unlocks your DNA...\" and soon you will become addicted to movies like the rest of us. While we wait for David Ehrlich's annual countdown video (arriving in early January) here's another one looking back at the best of the year. This video countdown is put together by movie lovers Kyle Wilson and Patrick Ryan - featuring their combined picks for the 25 Best Films of 2024. Ready to dive in and find out what their favorites are? It's also an exciting supercut video featuring footage from all 25 movies listed and a few others - as they look back at the year in cinema. There's some excellent editing in this, stringing together clips and bits of dialogue and songs from these films. This is a robust list featuring documentaries, international features, different genres and everything else amazing from 2024. But it looks like Nosferatu didn't make the cut? I'm so happy to see both La Chimera (my #1 of last year) and Dune: Part Two showing up on so many Best of the Year lists now that we're at the end of 2024. View the full countdown video below. Thanks to Twitter for the tip on this [â€¦]",
