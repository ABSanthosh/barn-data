  "description": "\"It's now or never.\" MGM + Orion have unveiled the second \u0026 final trailer for the film Nickel Boys, which has started playing in select US theaters now. This film is a modern masterpiece and will be on my Top 10 of the year, along with many others. Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel from Colson Whitehead, Nickel Boys chronicles the powerful friendship between two African American men navigating the harrowing trials of reform school together in Florida. Nickel Boys stars Ethan Herisse as Elwood, Brandon Wilson as Turner, Hamish Linklater, Fred Hechinger, Daveed Diggs, \u0026 Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor. It's presented mainly from the POV of the two main characters, which gives it an especially distinct look and feel. Reviews add: \"By the time the credits roll, Ross will have made a lasting \u0026 unique impression of heartbreak on the souls of all who watch his film—precisely the cinematic treatment that Whitehead's novel required.\" I had a chance to watch this film and it's exceptional - it is so powerful, a vibrant story of friendship and tenacity.

A must see now that it's playing in theaters - don't miss this one. Here's the second official trailer for RaMell Ross' masterpiece Nickel Boys, direct from MGM's YouTube: You can rewatch the first official trailer for RaMell Ross' Nickel Boys film right here for even more footage. Elwood Curtis's college dream shatters alongside a two-lane Florida highway. Bearing the brunt of an innocent misstep, he’s sentenced to the netherworld of Nickel Academy, a brutal reformatory sunk deep in the Jim Crow South. He encounters another ward, the seen-it-all Turner. The two Black teens strike up an alliance: Turner dispensing fundamental tips for survival, Elwood, clinging to his optimistic worldview. Backdropped by the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement, their existence appear worlds away from Rev. Martin Luther King's burnished oratory. Despite Nickel's brutality, Elwood strives to hold onto humanity, awakening a new vision for Turner. Nickel Boys is directed by acclaimed American filmmaker RaMell Ross, his second film after making Hale County This Morning This Evening previously. The screenplay is written by RaMell Ross \u0026 Joslyn Barnes. Adapted from the book \"The Nickel Boys\" by Colson Whitehead. Produced by Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, David Levine, Joslyn Barnes. This first premiered at the 2024 Telluride Film Festival. Orion \u0026 MGM will release Nickel Boys in theaters starting December 13th, 2024. Find more posts in: Indies, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
