  "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Mike Wiluan‘s upcoming Indonesian supernatural horror Melati: Revenge in Blood has been boarded by London-based SC Films International for worldwide sales rights (excluding Southeast Asia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China). Currently in post-production, Melati: Revenge in Blood stars Indonesian actors Alexandra Gottardo (Losmen Melati) and Dwi Sasono (Mendadak Dangdut). Gottardo also serves as producer, alongside Freddie Yeo (Westworld), Daphne Yang (Losmen Melati), Shao-Yi Chen (Lost in Perfection), Tina Arwin (Pengepungan Di Bukit Duri) and Ninin Musa (Orang Ikan). After co-producing Crazy Rich Asians and working on Buffalo Boys and HBO Asia’s Grisse, Wiluan wrote and directed Orang Ikan last year. The film premiered at the Tokyo International Film Festival and was recently acquired by Shudder for North America, UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. Watch on Deadline Melati: Revenge in Blood is based on 2023 TV mini-series Losmen Melati. Melati: Revenge in Blood follows Fadil, the sole escapee of a haunted house. Fadil discovers that he has been cursed by Melati, who harnesses the inn’s dark curse, and in return gains eternal life and the power of resurrection. In a quest for vengeance, Fadil assembles a squad of killers to hunt down those responsible for his torment. However, as Fadil learns more about the inn’s resurrective powers, he is consumed by his desire to bring back his wife and consequently, a violent battle ensues. The film is co-produced by Catchplay, who retain all rights for Southeast Asia, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Melati: Revenge in Blood was supported by Singapore Film Commission through the Media Enterprise Programme. The deal was finalized between SC Films’ Simon Crowe and Fumie Suzuki Lancaster, and Shao-Yi Chen and Chia-Hua Yeh of Screenworks Asia, and Freddie Yeo from Infinite Studios Singapore. SC Films will have a first promo of the film available for viewing at Cannes. “Melati is an Indonesian horror icon with strong local folklore roots,” said Wiluan. “Told through a bold and stylised form of Asian action horror, I’m excited to showcase a story that further expands the universe of Losmen Melati. I’m eager for International audiences to continue the trials and tribulations of its central female character. I’m grateful for Catchplay and Singapore Film Commission for their continued support and looking forward to working again with SC Films.” Lancaster from SC Films said: “We’re thrilled to be reuniting with Mike and his incredible team at Infinite Studios and it’s great to be linking-up with Catchplay again, but this time partnering on a project that they are co-producing. Melati is gripping, atmospheric, and wildly original. It’s a bold, high-concept horror that international audiences are hungry for.” Chen from Catchplay added: “We are excited to continue our collaboration with Mike and the team on Melati, taking this beloved story to the next level for horror fans around the world. This time, with SC Films on board, we’re confident that Melati will scare the whole world with her darker power and curse.”",
