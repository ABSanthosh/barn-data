Moreover, who shepherded us into this bold new world. Director Greg Kohrs and producer Gary Krieg sought this very answer and it brought them to Demis Hassabis.   Demis Hassabis began his journey as a young chess prodigy before shifting gears toward changing the world. He was drawn to the game as a “A fun thinking game,” but after a particularly long battle at a world tournament, he saw a futility in wasting his brain on games when there were real challenges to which he could apply his talents.    During a gap year between high school and college, Demis got an internship at Bullfrog games, where he implemented rudimentary AI into a PC game called Theme Park. His innovation allowed the NPCs to react to each other as well as the gamers’ intervention and create a more interconnected and immersive experience. This caught the eye of Electronic Arts and changed the trajectory of video games for years to come. Despite this transformative influence, Demis focused on college and after graduation sought to tackle the issue of Artificial General Intelligence.   For the uninitiated, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a true thinking creation. Inspired to a point by the AI Deep Blue defeating Chess master Kasparov in 1997, Demis was duly impressed by the victory but saw the limitation of an innovation that could ONLY play chess. As admirable as that was, Demis saw an imminent future where an AI could beat Finish the article on AICN McEricThu, 06 Feb 2025 01:26:00 +000083603Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH MEhttps://www.aintitcool.com/touch-me-sundance-midnight-83602/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviewsMcEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry Finish the article on AICN McEricTue, 21 Jan 2025 04:16:00 +000083602NOSFERATU - Succumb to the Darknesshttps://www.aintitcool.com/nosferatu-review-eric-mcclanahan-83601/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviewsEric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN McEricTue, 31 Dec 2024 01:37:00 +000083601James Fox Discusses His Documentary THE PROGRAMhttps://www.aintitcool.com/interview-james-fox-the-program-uap-reports-83600/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviewsFilmmaker James Fox discusses his new documentary THE PROGRAM which examines the United States government's pre-existing relationship with UAPs. Read the full article on AICN In a new AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SEGMENT, I will do something terrifically similar to what I did the last time I did this segment, and now that I'm reading that out loud I realize how ridiculous it sounds. Regardless, I once again enter the realm of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and speak with a specialist about what the United States knows, what it doesn't, and the barriers that are preventing it from disclosing its full knowledge to the public. Let's get one thing established right away: the conversation around alien visitation has changed. When I chatted with Disclosure Activist Stephen Bassett back in 2021, we weren't discussing if these visitations were real but rather why we weren't being told about them. Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien. That part is transparent, but THE PROGRAM's findings aren't, and that is the subject of filmmaker James Fox's new documentary, THE PROGRAM. I chatted with James Fox, filmmaker of The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and I Know What I Saw, to discuss THE PROGRAM after viewing it, and though we were able to talk for quite a while, I didn't really have that many questions.

Read the full article on AICN Everything about film has changed, and while some lambast this brave new world, it does have its silver linings. Streaming services took over channels and then became their own studios. For every Netflix dud there's a great horror film championed by SHUDDER, Bloody Disgusting, or Fangoria that would go otherwise unproduced. SHUDDER, specifically, has been picking up amazing films, from last year's LATE NIGHT WITH THE DEVIL to this year's IN A VIOLENT NATURE. The studio is ending the year strong with a meta take on the coming-of-age slasher rom-com called BLOODY AXE WOUND, releasing in limited theaters before landing on the streamer in early 2025. The synopsis is as follows: Abbie Bladecut (Sari Arambulo, \"A.P. Bio\") is a teenager torn between the macabre traditions of her family’s bloody trade and the tender stirrings of her first crush (Molly Brown, \"Dexter: Original Sin\"). In the small town of Clover Falls, Abbie’s father, Roger Bladecut (Billy Burke, TWILIGHT), has built an infamous legacy by capturing real-life killings on tape and selling them to eager customers, but as Abbie delves deeper into the grisly family business, she begins to wonder if it’s time to take the family tradition in a new direction.  The conceit of the film is surprisingly fresh in a genre that finds new ways to reinvent itself with shocking regularity. Set within the confines of a horror film, we see what it might be like to grow up in a family where the patriarch is a serial killer/slasher who rises from the grave Finish the article on AICN McEricFri, 27 Dec 2024 05:10:00 +000083599Barbarella Dives into Conversation with FREEDIVER Director Michael John Warren!https://www.aintitcool.com/michaeljohnwarreninterview2024freediver-83598/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnewsBarbarella Dives into Conversation with FREEDIVER Director Michael John Warren! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here. Michael John Warren’s latest documentary Freediver is available on Prime Video, or buy or rent on Digital starting December 7, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov’s unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving’s impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death.  Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like “How long could I hold my breath?” - the answer is not long at all - or “Would I ever consider free diving?” The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both! Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience.

Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

Read the full article on AICN Found footage horror. Do you love it? Do you hate it? Do you think it is its own genre or do you lump it in with its overarching tone - slasher, supernatural, monster, etc. Love it or hate it, the convention is here to stay, as it offers a realistic, relatable approach to horror that blurs the lines between reality, film, empathy, and voyeurism.   So, when I got an email asking if I wanted to screen the feature DEVON, written and directed by Jenni “JWoww” Farley, I said “of course I do!” My wife is a fan of “Jersey Shore” and has been since day one, so I mostly did it for her, but I was also very curious what the singular star would bring to the horror pantheon. The logline read:   Devon's parents never stopped searching for answers after her disappearance from a notorious asylum. Years after the incident, a mysterious website draws five adventurers to the abandoned asylum where she was last seen. Armed with cameras, they plunge into the darkness, unaware they’re filming their own descent into horror—never meant to return.     I got the chance to chat with writer/director/producer Jenni “JWoww” Farley about jumping into a feature-length film, the serendipitous location, and her crew.      Eric McClanahan: Hey, Jenni! How are you?   Jenni “JWoww” Farley: Good. Nervous.    EM: Nervous? Why are you nervous?   JJF: I feel like this is [me] kind of starting my career over. It’s a different world, a different element.

Barbarella here to talk about dark comedy Hippo, or more accurately to share the conversation I had with Hippo’s director and writer Mark Rapaport. Genuinely funny, this incredible film has the potential to achieve cult status, so long as people take a chance on this black-and-white gem and actually see it. I recommend that they do. Hippo stars Kimball Farley, Lilla Kizlinger, Eliza Roberts, and Eric Roberts as the narrator. It tells the story of two exceptionally different teens being raised by their mother in a somewhat isolated existence. At times, it reminds me of Yorgos Lanthimos’ Dogtooth, in the way that the children in Hippo are sheltered, while not in the same extreme way they were in the Greek film, both films make strong points about the detriment of isolation. The two would make a great double-feature, but if you want to jump on this one first, Hippo will be in select theaters November 8.  At any rate, after a night of minimal sleep due to staying out late at the Pink concert, I caught up with Mark Rapaport, and we had a fun chat about the movie. Check it out! Barbara: Why go black and white with this?  Mark: I've always loved classic movies, but I never thought I would make a movie in black and white until my cinematographer started taking photos of black and white, and I was like, “These are so cool and good, why don't more people shoot in black and white? Maybe we should do something like that.” He was very into that.

Read the full article on AICN ‘Tis the season, for a few more hours, before Mariah Carey breaks through her ice-cocoon and heralds in the winter holidays. If you need a couple of thrillers to hold back the tide of the inevitable, I’ve got you covered with a couple of brand new features released this very month: HOLD YOUR BREATH and DIE ALONE.   DIE ALONE stars Carrie-Anne Moss (THE MATRIX, “The Acolyte”), Frank Grillo (CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, ONE DAY AS A LION), Douglas Smith (HBO’s “Big Love”), and Kimberly-Sue Murray (Netflix’s “V-Wars”). The film is written and directed by Lowell Dean (WOLFCOP, SUPERGRID) and released by Quiver Distribution. After an outbreak turns the majority of the population into plant-based zombies, a young man (Smith) with amnesia searches for his lost love and stumbles across a rugged survivalist (Moss). Check out the trailer:     If you’re getting “The Last of Us” vibes, you’re on the right track. The film features some pretty great creature effects, apt desolation to sell the apocalypse, and a surprisingly original story. Moss is the star of the show, by far, and carries her scenes with a deadpan humor that keeps the heavy subject matter from swallowing the viewer in despair. The budget limitations are clear but the film that emerges is certainly a smart, fun ride that hits all the points of an apocalyptic thriller with a (predictable) plot twist and great performances.   I got the chance to chat with Carrie-Anne Moss about the production of the film, her bicycle-riding skills, and dream roles.

I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing.  If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015). Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor Finish the article on AICN staffSat, 05 Oct 2024 14:56:00 +000083593STRANGE HARVEST: THE OCCULT MURDER IN THE INLAND EMPIRE Premieres at Fantastic Fest 2024!https://www.aintitcool.com/strangeharvestinterview2024-83592/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnewsSTRANGE HARVEST: THE OCCULT MURDER IN THE INLAND EMPIRE Premieres at Fantastic Fest 2024! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends. Barbarella here. Strange Harvest: The Occult Murder in the Inland Empire is a long title for a great narrative utilizing the true-crime documentary format. The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking I’m watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, it’s only a movie.  It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, and I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out! Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff. Peter: Bless You.  Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that.  Stuart: Thank you.   Barbara: Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for?  Stuart: I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

The film tells the story of young Brian David, an avatar of Kevin Smith, and his adventures at the local Atlantic Cinema where he watches films with his friends Burny and Belly in 1986. It’s a departure from the View Askewniverse that Smith started thirty years ago, which admittedly stretched to its possible breaking point as the characters within encountered rebel angels, demons, Hollywood, jewel thieves, terrorists, and a monkey. THE 4:30 MOVIE offers a much more grounded story of a simpler time when the cinema and video store ruled the weekend, and the lives on the silver screen either mirrored our own or showed us worlds we could only imagine.  I had the opportunity to chat with Kevin Smith yesterday in support of the film’s digital release and it went exactly as I thought it would: we were given six minutes, I asked one question, and he talked for eight. What I got in that response, though, was a good deal of wisdom about what the filmmaker attempts when he puts his memories to screen for our amusement, how he’s remained relevant, and where his ideas originate. Prior to the interview’s start, my cat Bennie decided she needed to be part of it all, as well, and leapt onto the seat behind me.    Eric McClanahan - Hi Kevin!   Kevin Smith - Hello, Eric!

This time the terror is set against the backdrop of Christmas, with Art (David Howard Thornton) returning to hunt down Sienna (Lauren Lavera) after she cut his head off in the last installment. The film picks up right at the end of Part 2 before allowing Art to take a five year siesta while Sienna spends time in facilities piecing her psyche back together. Young Jonathan Shaw (Elliott Fullam) isn’t so young anymore, attending college near his Aunt and Uncle, Jessica and Mark (Margaret Anne Florence and Alex Ross), with whom Sienna stays after being checked out of the latest facility.  The film opens with Art dispatching a family while dressed in a Santa Claus suit, letting the audience know right away that no one is safe. The entire film plays out as a supercut of gory kills and dark humor, with occasional moments of genuine world-building that allows the supporting cast to really stretch their acting muscles. Plotwise, the film seems to be more focused on showcasing creative kills than telling a cohesive story, and the end seems somewhat rushed, as though the filmmakers had almost forgotten that they had to end the thing.    What a TERRIFIER fan is looking for, however, is exactly what they’ll find in 3: inventive kills, stomach-turning sound design, laughs that’ll make you question your own morality, and surprises.

Dale Read the full article on AICN Hi friends, Barbarella here. Sci-fi film Subservience, starring Megan Fox, Michele Morrone  (his name’s Italian so the “ch” is pronounced like a “k”), Madeline Zima, and Matilda Firth, just came out on Demand and Digital, so let’s talk about AI. Do you think artificial intelligence will bring about major medical advancements, or do you envision more of a Terminator situation evolving? I tend to think it’s not the AI itself but whoever’s behind it that should be on whom we focus our concern. When it comes to cinema, filmmakers always hold technology responsible, because let’s face it, that makes for a more entertaining movie. I would argue Will Honley and April Maguire’s screenplay puts at least some of the onus on the humans. Maybe don’t say certain things to a Sim that’s constantly evolving and learning; that’s all I’m saying. If it weren’t for one comment made to Alice (Megan Fox), the attractive Sim acquired to help out around the house, perhaps a lot of mayhem could have been avoided.    I appreciate that the conflict in Subservience primarily occurs within the family unit, as this makes it more believable to me. Favoring older technologies, Nick (Michele Morrone) isn’t the biggest fan of artificial intelligence, but when he and his sick wife (Madeline Zima) can’t keep up with managing the household and children, he caves and gets Alice, the best new Sim on the market, to help out, and you know that’s not going to work out quite how everyone expects, well, at least how everyone Finish the article on AICN BarbarellaSat, 14 Sep 2024 13:57:00 +000083589THE 4:30 MOVIE's Cast Speaks About Kevin Smith's New Comedyhttps://www.aintitcool.com/interview-cast-new-kevin-smith-film-83588/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviewsMcEric chats with the cast of Kevin Smith's THE 4:30 MOVIE Read the full article on AICN Writer/Director Kevin Smith began his View Askewniverse in 1994 with his breakout hit CLERKS. The film tells the story of a couple of slackers working dead-end jobs in New Jersey in the 1990s and the conversations and misadventures they dabble in along the way. The film paved the way for countless stories, and so far nine films by Smith have rounded out its canon, along with several animated adventures and more in the pages of comic books. Before Dante and Randall ever sat around the Quik Stop and chatted about JAWS, STAR WARS, or even NAVY SEALS, young Kevin Smith was a New Jersey native soaking up inspiration on the silver screen at his local movie theater, the Atlantic Highlands Cinema. Flash forward to today and he owns that theater, rebranded as the Smodcastle, where he showcases new releases, repertory classics, film festivals, and even special screenings of “Movies With Kev,” where he screens a classic and participates in a Q\u0026A following the screening.   Finally the formative experiences of young Kev are getting their own film treatment, with Kevin Smith’s newest release, THE 4:30 MOVIE, premiering tomorrow in cinemas around the country. The film, not set within the View Askewniverse, tells the story of a young man named Brian David, a not-even-thinly-veiled stand-in for Kevin Smith, played by Austin Zajur, who one day in the late spring of 1986 asks his crush Melody Barnegat (Siena Agudong) to meet him at the movies.

It feels a little wrong that I have a ton of pep today while I’m covering a movie about the very serious topic of suicide, but here we are. Continue makes a personal and powerful statement from writer, director, and star Nadine Crocker, who survived her own suicide attempt in her twenties. In Theaters, On Demand and Digital September 6, 2024, Continue escorts viewers through Dean’s struggles as she experience life after a suicide attempt. Beautifully shot, the film also includes an unexpected love story, albeit, I’m not sure I believe that two people would be that flirtatious while discussing their past traumas, but just because I wouldn’t flirt while sharing horrific things from the past doesn’t mean it’s not possible that some people might. Anyway, before I veer too far off-topic, the movie stars an actor of whom I’ve been a fan since first seeing him about fifteen years ago in an independent film at Fantastic Fest called Deadgirl, and I’m grateful to have the opportunity to chat with that actor, Shiloh Fernandez, about the film.  Right out of the gate, I share my love of Deadgirl and Shiloh’s performance in it.

Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends. Barbarella here. A new Western, Place of Bones, rides into theaters and on digital Friday, August 23, 2024. Unlike the Westerns of yesteryear, this one is female-led, with Audrey Cummings in the director’s chair and Heather Graham shining in the lead role as a mother who, along with her daughter (Brielle Robillard), must fight for survival when a gang of outlaws, led by Tom Hopper, arrives in the area.    I’ve been a Tom Hopper fan ever since he won me over with his enticing portrayal of Billy Bones in Black Sails. He earns additional adoration from me through the way he injects subtle humor as villain Bear John in this film. I find myself laughing at moments that I’m fairly certain weren’t intended to be funny, yet he fires wit like a true sharp-shooter with a faint exasperation about him that’s just funny. However, he’s not the only one who offers something more than just delivering what’s written on the page. Corin Nemec, Brielle Robillard, and Heather Graham also add an extra something that gives insight into their characters and adds a bit of snark to the exchanges.   I had the opportunity to speak with Audrey Cummings, and I sometimes like to break the ice with a question about Muppet-casting on remakes. While she placed Kermit, Miss Piggy and Fozzy Bear in the lead roles of Calhoun (Corin Nemec), Pandora (Heather Graham), and Hester (Brielle Robillard), I took a completely different approach, thinking it would be fun to have Statler and Finish the article on AICN BarbarellaThu, 22 Aug 2024 23:29:00 +000083585#ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEADhttps://www.aintitcool.com/all-my-friends-are-dead-interview-83584/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviews#ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD director Marcus Dunstan and star Jade Pettyjohn talk to McEric about the new slasher comedy! Read the full article on AICN There was every manner of film at this year’s Tribeca Festival, and I managed to take in thirteen features, four shorts, and an episodic premiere by the time the whole thing wrapped this past June. One of the highlights was the opportunity to interview two of the lead talents behind the new slasher ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD: director Marcus Dunstan and star Jade Pettyjohn. We met at the Roxy Hotel bar and restaurant, a favorite meetup spot of mine, on a Saturday morning. I was, admittedly, running late, but they were so patient and gracious with me and I always appreciate that from stars and filmmakers, whose lives are probably ten times as cluttered as mine.  Its logline says of the film: “A group of college friends rents an airbnb for the biggest music festival of the year. However, their weekend of partying soon takes a deadly turn as a masked killer murders them one by one according to their sins.” The film, though familiar in synopsis, finds a way to inject new life into a tired formula. The design of the killer is unique, the kills are creative, the victims are fighters rather than training dummies, for the most part, and the twist(s) are welcome.   Marcus Dunstan is perpetually smiling, speaking in a small voice from a large, gentle face. Jade Pettyjohn is excitable, clearly enjoying being at the festival and also talking about this joyous diversion in her filmography. We couldn’t help but jump right in.

Read the full article on AICN In some exciting news circulating the internet, it would seem that the ex-head of film at Netflix Scott Stuber is reviving the once legendary United Artists label through new partners Amazon MGM Studios. Founded in 1919 by the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickforth, D.W.Griffith and famed actor and filmmaker Douglas Fairbanks, United Artists began as a studio that would allow artists to control their own careers and artistic vision instead of being controlled by Hollywood moneymen. After decades of success, Metro Goldwyn Mayer bought the company over in 1981 for an unheard-of 350 million dollars and continued to release movies under the brand MGM/UA through the rest of the 80s, 90s and 2000s. United Artists are responsible for releasing some of the most classic movies of all time including The Mark of Zorro (1920), D.W.Griffith’s final film The Struggle (1931), The Great Dictator (1941), Alexander the Great (1956), Robert Mitchum’s Thunder Road (1958), The Magnificent Seven (1960), Dr. No (1963), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), Rocky (1976), Annie Hall (1977), Raging Bull (1980) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985) to name but a few.  Jennifer Salke (Head of Amazon MGM Studios) had this to say about the resurrection:   “With his proven track record of delivering global hits and an eye towards theatrical fare, Scott’s expertise and vision align perfectly with our film strategy. We are so proud to welcome him on the relaunch of the legendary UA brand, as we work to leverage existing and new IP into big, broad films Finish the article on AICN HouseOfMacleodSat, 27 Jul 2024 01:22:00 +000083578Fanhome Launches The Legends of Batman Collectionhttps://www.aintitcool.com/fanhome-legends-of-batman-collection-83577/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=comicsFanhome, a subscription-based models and collections service, launches a Batman collection for the ages.

I’ve had quite a couple months, and I wish I could say that I was gallivanting around the globe, but not this time. I’ve been sick a good chunk of it. In fact, I had quite a fever when I screened Murder Company, written by Jesse Mittelstadt and directed by Shane Dax Taylor. I don’t know that it would be fair to the filmmakers to review the film, given that I was feeling so awful while watching it that I don’t think my thoughts would necessarily be a true reflection of how the movie was. I will make a few observations, though.  First of all, Kelsey Grammer was my favorite thing about Murder Company, which is currently On Digital and On Demand, and I wanted him to have far more screen time. I love a serious Kelsey Grammer, and he's incredibly serious in this. Second, while there was far less graphic violence and gore than I would have expected from a war movie made in this day and age, the filmmakers seemed to compensate for that with the amount of people flying around, proving yet again that stunt men are insane. “Yeah, you can hurl me into that tree. Sure.” Finally, could we please stop having people engage in casual conversations while walking through enemy-occupied territories? I understand that it seems a good way to develop characters, but it drives me crazy every time anyone has a conversation at a normal volume as if they’re just strolling through the Finish the article on AICN BarbarellaFri, 12 Jul 2024 01:44:00 +000083575It May Only be July, but Here's a Trailer for THE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER!https://www.aintitcool.com/bestchristmaspageantevertrailer2024-83574/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnewsIt May Only be July, but Here's a Trailer for THE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER!

Read the full article on AICN I get a lot of emails. A lot of invites to screen films, read books, watch documentaries, talk to strangers. A lot. I can’t answer them all, sadly. But when I got an email that said there was a new film coming out with Chuck Norris and Marc Singer, and would I like to talk to Marc Singer about it, I practically broke the sound barrier with my swift response of “hell to the yes!”     I’m a man of a certain age, and I grew up in the wilds of Southeast Texas. As I recall my rough and tumble childhood, I don’t say I’m from the streets - I’m from the roads. Concrete jungle films didn’t interest me quite as much as actual jungle films, so if you wanted my ticket money, throw an animal or two in your film. Want to see Clint Eastwood act with a monkey? Hell yes, take my money.   So for me there was no greater action franchise than the BEASTMASTER films starring Marc Singer. The Sword \u0026 Sorcery world of Conan distilled through the eyes and wings of beasts and marketed to a younger audience, it surprised me to learn that the films came out in the same year and were envisioned in relative ignorance of one another.

  "text": "It’s apparent that we’re living in the future, but how did we get here? Moreover, who shepherded us into this bold new world. Director Greg Kohrs and producer Gary Krieg sought this very answer and it brought them to Demis Hassabis. Demis Hassabis began his journey as a young chess prodigy before shifting gears toward changing the world. He was drawn to the game as a “A fun thinking game,” but after a particularly long battle at a world tournament, he saw a futility in wasting his brain on games when there were real challenges to which he could apply his talents.  During a gap year between high school and college, Demis got an internship at Bullfrog games, where he implemented rudimentary AI into a PC game called Theme Park. His innovation allowed the NPCs to react to each other as well as the gamers’ intervention and create a more interconnected and immersive experience. This caught the eye of Electronic Arts and changed the trajectory of video games for years to come. Despite this transformative influence, Demis focused on college and after graduation sought to tackle the issue of Artificial General Intelligence. For the uninitiated, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a true thinking creation. Inspired to a point by the AI Deep Blue defeating Chess master Kasparov in 1997, Demis was duly impressed by the victory but saw the limitation of an innovation that could ONLY play chess. As admirable as that was, Demis saw an imminent future where an AI could beat the world’s greatest chess players AND continue to learn from every stimuli surrounding it. An artificial general intelligence - in essence, a computerized brain. To this end, Demis founded DeepMind with colleague Shane Legg and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, which got to work immediately teaching it through cue and deep learning. The first step in learning was similar to Demis’s personal experience - games. Pong, Breakout, Chess. Early successes found DeepMind purchased by Google, then the team created AlphaGo to perfect the ancient token game, made famous by Darren Aronofsky’s PI. AlphaGo defeated the best player in Korea, then took on Ke Jie from China. Just before it looked like AlphaGo had Jie beat, China cuts the feed.  Next came AlphaZero. Rather than learning from gameplay with humans, AlphaZero was given games with no instructions and learned from itself and rewards gained from achieving objectives. The learning was exponential, so the team suggested it play Starcraft II, the real-time strategy game. Before long, AlphaZero was winning matches against ranked players around the world.  As fun as games were, Demis wanted a real challenge with real victories. With this in mind, the team at DeepMind created AlphaFold, an application that attempted to tackle the unsolvable problem of Protein Folding. Rooted in the intersection of Biology and Mathematics, Protein Folding is a science of deduction - given a string of Amino Acids, can a technician predict the shape of the protein into which it will be folded. With this intuition, one can reverse-engineer viruses into vaccines, and perhaps in an even more exciting application, “This knowledge is vital to uncovering their function in cancer cells and importantly, how they can be targeted and treated.” DeepMind entered AlphaFold into CASP, the Clinical Assessment of Structure Prediction, which presents teams with Amino Acid sequences and challenges them to predict the folded protein, grading them on accuracy to the existing proteins. During the Pandemic, AlphaFold won the CASP challenge with an unheard of accuracy over 90%, prompting the scientific community to declare the problem solved. In celebration of this, the team at DeepMind used AlphaFold to unfold 200 million proteins and release the results for free to the scientific community. This act won the team the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024. Director Greg Kohs didn’t know for sure his subject would win the Nobel Prize when he began filming Demis back in 2016, but he had some intuition toward it. That intuition didn’t come to his aid when he passed on directing JOE DIRT back in 2000, but he learned his filmmaking credo from his first subject, a Neil Diamond tribute artist who went by the stage name of “Lightning” - “Relax, we’ll get there faster by going slower.”  Intuition has benefited Greg Kohs several times in his career - the documentary just mentioned, SONG SUNG BLUE, has been adapted into a feature film by director Craig Brewer (HUSTLE \u0026 FLOW) starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson. A feature script from John Sayles (THE BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET, PASSION FISH) is making the rounds based off another of his documentaries, THE GREAT ALONE, about cancer-survivor and 4-time Iditarod champion Lance Mackey. Maybe Greg Kohs is living in the future, too. THE THINKING GAME is the story of a man’s unending fascination with questions and answers, of thinking and solving, and of the complexity of the world’s mysteries distilled into a simple game. I spoke with Greg and Gary this past Wednesday ahead of the film’s release this coming weekend. Eric McClanahan - I was very excited to screen this film - it came across my radar at Tribeca this past year and it’s a fascinating concept, which turned into a really fascinating documentary. My first question is for Greg: when and how did you decide to tell Demis’s story? Greg Kohs - Well that journey began back in 2016 when Gary and myself made a film called ALPHAGO, a feature-length documentary that was on Netflix and now is free on YouTube. That film, while making it, was our first introduction to Demis Hassabis. At the time, he and his team had created an algorithm to play a 3,000-year-old board game called Go and defeat the world champion. We didn’t know a lot about Demis at the time but we started to learn more and more about him and this fascinating journey that he’s been on since being a chess prodigy at the age of four. And that’s where it all began.  Eric McClanahan - Nice. So Gary, you’ve been on board this project since 2016, as well. How did you and Greg meet? Gary Krieg - We met when previously we both had been working in commercial production. We’d worked on some Nike commercials and crossed paths that way. When this project started, I happened to be at Google Creative Lab and Dem had done some work on some AI projects. When Demis reached out to ask if there was a camera crew available to document the tournament coming up in Seoul and could the Creative Lab send anyone over, and because Greg had done work at Creative Lab, as well, we knew he was a trusted filmmaker and we should definitely document the tournament. But we should also go to London in the weeks prior to document code lock just so there’s a more complete story, and by day two in Seoul we knew there was more than a complete story here. This wasn’t just documenting an event; there’s actually a feature film here.  Eric McClanahan - What is amazing is that it sounds like you guys got into this story in medias res and discovered all this rich backstory, but there’s also a prescience to your involvement because now they’re Nobel Prize winners. Did you see the potential for this phenomenon growing to that level? Greg Kohs - Well, interestingly, when we began filming/following AlphaGo, we took up a mission to continue documenting kind of behind the curtain at DeepMind with the different research threads that were going on, and there are many. We had full access to the lab, anywhere we wanted to go, we were cleared. We just couldn’t share with any of the other teams, like the team we were just interviewing or speaking to, because it was all very confidential. But one of those teams we encountered was this group of ragtag researchers, scientists, who were taking up this challenge to create an algorithm that would help realize the structures of proteins, or in other words, fold a protein. We had no idea what that was, but we did some research and learned that if this 50-year-old grand challenge could be solved, then for whoever solved it, it would be potentially a Nobel-worthy achievement. It was at that point on our filmmakers’ bulletin board that we added a notecard with a sharpie doodle of what looked like a medal, though we never used the word “Nobel.” We called it “ABBA,” that was our code name, because all these tech people love their code names, so our code name as “ABBA” so as not to jinx it and not let anyone know our outrageous expectation. Including Demis, too. He’d ask “What’s that card?” and we’d say “Oh, that’s ABBA.” So, yeah, we did know that if they achieve their goal it could happen; it wasn’t guaranteed but it could happen. And that was about six years before it actually did happen. It happened well within the first year we were filming.  Gary Krieg - I would add, day one of filming the AlphaFold team, though, no. [Laughs] There was no expectation that that was going to lead to a Nobel. It just seemed this insurmountable problem that it would take many, many years before they made any progress. Greg Kohs - Yeah, there was more head-scratching filmed than anything else, the whole time.  Eric McClanahan - It is an amazing progression they’d made at DeepMind with AlphaFold, AlphaGo, and AlphaZero, which learned from itself. Speaking of learning, what was the learning curve for you as filmmakers going into a science that’s this deep? Did you feel bewildered the whole while or did you just do a lot of homework? Greg Kohs - Well, for me, personally, I was clueless on so much of this; the science, that is. So we’d be filming and we’d hear terms and then you’d go back to your hotel room and Google it to try to figure out what was just said or you’d look over the transcript of a meeting. So, yeah, it was challenging, especially when it came to proteins. Once we learned about this team and the implications of if they were able to solve this problem, we did a deep dive. I don’t think we could have PhDs, but we tried. And we almost learned too much because our earlier cuts were way too over the heads of our test audiences. Then we had to really pare it back. But our favorite question when talking to these scientists, or way of framing a question, was always “Explain it to me like a five-year-old.” Which was just saying explain it to me so I can understand it because I felt that’s about where my brain was when talking to them. So, that was very helpful, and they worked hard with us to make it understandable. What did you think, Gary? Gary Krieg - I would add that early on Demis said “Focus on why we’re doing it, not how we’re doing it.” As storytellers, as filmmakers, that was really attractive, because it’s about the people doing the thing as much as the thing, itself.  Eric McClanahan - Speaking of prescience, Greg you had a project that came out in 2008, SONG SUNG BLUE, that you’d originally envisioned as a scripted Hollywood juggernaut and you were laughed out of offices, but now that it is a Hollywood feature film coming out this year. And I also understand that you have a developed script for THE GREAT ALONE and you’re looking to see that realized as a narrative film. Telling me about standing at the precipice of these projects of yours about to be realized as you’d originally envisioned them. Greg Kohs - Yeah, it’s pretty surreal. It’s exciting, SONG SUNG BLUE, in particular, was made in hopes of helping this couple that the film tells the story of; I just wanted to help them. The documentary did very well - it got attention, in its first review, from I think Aint’t It Cool News, which is really cool, back in the day, and Roger Ebert found it. Everyone kind of found it, and that really was great for the subjects of the film, Claire and Mike, but I always in the back of my mind wished I could’ve really helped them, helped them in some way live a better life. I’m so thrilled that it’s now being remade, that Craig Brewer found it, and wrote a script based on the documentary, which is very close to the film, and now they’re getting the attention and the resources that I had always hoped they would’ve gotten. So that makes me really happy. The same goes for THE GREAT ALONE, which is still in development with a wonderful script by John Sayles. You know, I’ve always been off the grid with my filmmaking - I haven’t really adapted to the industry norm, if there is one anymore, so it’s been a lot harder to do things, it’s taken longer, but as Lightning from SONG SUNG BLUE once said, “You’ll get there faster going slower.” And so I always keep that in mind. Who knows? Maybe THE THINKING GAME and Demis’ story will make it to the silver screen beyond a feature documentary one day. Eric McClanahan - Yeah, let’s get Sorkin on the screenplay and Fincher to direct! Greg Kohs - Yeah, we’re all for that. Eric McClanahah - Fantastic! Well, that’s all the time we have. I really appreciate you guys talking to me and I really enjoyed the film and the opportunity to pick your brains about it and I can’t wait to see what you guys do next. Greg Kohs - Thank you for giving it some attention. We appreciate it. THE THINKING GAME was an official selection of the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival and will be available to stream on Friday, February 7 on Amazon, iTunes, and Google. “The Thinking Game is a compelling feature-length documentary film that chronicles the extraordinary life of Demis Hassabis, a visionary scientist on a relentless quest to solve the enigma of artificial general intelligence (AGI). This film delves into the creation of one of the world's most prominent AI labs, where Demis and his team made history with AlphaFold, a groundbreaking program that solved a 50-year grand challenge in biology. AlphaFold is already having a global impact by accelerating the development of revolutionary new drugs and paving the way for future advances in science.   The Thinking Game captures the exhilaration of historic breakthroughs like AlphaFold, the crushing weight of disappointment during setbacks, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge that defines Demis' unwavering commitment to scientific innovation. This film invites viewers to witness one of the most important scientific adventures of our time, exploring the potential of AGI to reshape our world.” Until next time, take care! -McEric, aka Eric McClanahan-",

Moreover, who shepherded us into this bold new world. Director Greg Kohrs and producer Gary Krieg sought this very answer and it brought them to Demis Hassabis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDemis Hassabis began his journey as a young chess prodigy before shifting gears toward changing the world. He was drawn to the game as a “A fun thinking game,” but after a particularly long battle at a world tournament, he saw a futility in wasting his brain on games when there were real challenges to which he could apply his talents. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDuring a gap year between high school and college, Demis got an internship at Bullfrog games, where he implemented rudimentary AI into a PC game called \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTheme Park\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e. His innovation allowed the NPCs to react to each other as well as the gamers’ intervention and create a more interconnected and immersive experience. This caught the eye of Electronic Arts and changed the trajectory of video games for years to come. Despite this transformative influence, Demis focused on college and after graduation sought to tackle the issue of Artificial General Intelligence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFor the uninitiated, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a true thinking creation. Inspired to a point by the AI Deep Blue defeating Chess master Kasparov in 1997, Demis was duly impressed by the victory but saw the limitation of an innovation that could ONLY play chess. As admirable as that was, Demis saw an imminent future where an AI could beat the world’s greatest chess players AND continue to learn from every stimuli surrounding it. An artificial general intelligence - in essence, a computerized brain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTo this end, Demis founded DeepMind with colleague Shane Legg and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, which got to work immediately teaching it through cue and deep learning. The first step in learning was similar to Demis’s personal experience - games. Pong, Breakout, Chess. Early successes found DeepMind purchased by Google, then the team created AlphaGo to perfect the ancient token game, made famous by Darren Aronofsky’s PI. AlphaGo defeated the best player in Korea, then took on Ke Jie from China. Just before it looked like AlphaGo had Jie beat, China cuts the feed. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg title=\" Playing Go in Pi\" src=\"https://media.aintitcool.com/media/_versions/article_images_2022/mceric/pi_go_medium.png\" alt=\"Playing Go in Pi\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNext came AlphaZero. Rather than learning from gameplay with humans, AlphaZero was given games with no instructions and learned from itself and rewards gained from achieving objectives. The learning was exponential, so the team suggested it play Starcraft II, the real-time strategy game. Before long, AlphaZero was winning matches against ranked players around the world. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAs fun as games were, Demis wanted a real challenge with real victories. With this in mind, the team at DeepMind created AlphaFold, an application that attempted to tackle the unsolvable problem of Protein Folding. Rooted in the intersection of Biology and Mathematics, Protein Folding is a science of deduction - given a string of Amino Acids, can a technician predict the shape of the protein into which it will be folded. With this intuition, one can reverse-engineer viruses into vaccines, and perhaps in an even more exciting application, “\u003ca title=\"Article on the ramifications of AlphaFold\u0026#39;s success\" href=\"https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2020/12/23/what-could-deepmind-solving-the-protein-folding-problem-mean-for-cancer-research/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThis knowledge is vital to uncovering their function in cancer cells and importantly, how they can be targeted and treated\u003c/a\u003e.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDeepMind entered AlphaFold into CASP, the Clinical Assessment of Structure Prediction, which presents teams with Amino Acid sequences and challenges them to predict the folded protein, grading them on accuracy to the existing proteins. During the Pandemic, AlphaFold won the CASP challenge with an unheard of accuracy over 90%, prompting the scientific community to declare the problem solved. In celebration of this, the team at DeepMind used AlphaFold to unfold 200 million proteins and release the results for free to the scientific community. This act won the team the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDirector Greg Kohs didn’t know for sure his subject would win the Nobel Prize when he began filming Demis back in 2016, but he had some intuition toward it. That intuition didn’t come to his aid when he passed on directing JOE DIRT back in 2000, but he learned his filmmaking credo from his first subject, a Neil Diamond tribute artist who went by the stage name of “Lightning” - “\u003ca title=\"SONG SUNG BLUE Director Statement\" href=\"https://www.reelasdirt.com/song-sung-blue-official-trailer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRelax, we’ll get there faster by going slower.\u003c/a\u003e” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIntuition has benefited Greg Kohs several times in his career - the documentary just mentioned, SONG SUNG BLUE, has been adapted into a feature film by director Craig Brewer (HUSTLE \u0026amp; FLOW) starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson. A feature script from John Sayles (THE BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET, PASSION FISH) is making the rounds based off another of his documentaries, THE GREAT ALONE, about cancer-survivor and 4-time Iditarod champion Lance Mackey. Maybe Greg Kohs is living in the future, too.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTHE THINKING GAME is the story of a man’s unending fascination with questions and answers, of thinking and solving, and of the complexity of the world’s mysteries distilled into a simple game. I spoke with Greg and Gary this past Wednesday ahead of the film’s release this coming weekend.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg title=\"The Thinking Game\" src=\"https://media.aintitcool.com/media/_versions/article_images_2022/mceric/the_thinking_game_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Thinking Game\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEric McClanahan - I was very excited to screen this film - it came across my radar at Tribeca this past year and it’s a fascinating concept, which turned into a really fascinating documentary. My first question is for Greg: when and how did you decide to tell Demis’s story?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreg Kohs - Well that journey began back in 2016 when Gary and myself made a film called ALPHAGO, a feature-length documentary that was on Netflix and now is free on YouTube. That film, while making it, was our first introduction to Demis Hassabis. At the time, he and his team had created an algorithm to play a 3,000-year-old board game called Go and defeat the world champion. We didn’t know a lot about Demis at the time but we started to learn more and more about him and this fascinating journey that he’s been on since being a chess prodigy at the age of four. And that’s where it all began. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEric McClanahan - Nice. So Gary, you’ve been on board this project since 2016, as well. How did you and Greg meet?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGary Krieg - We met when previously we both had been working in commercial production. We’d worked on some Nike commercials and crossed paths that way. When this project started, I happened to be at Google Creative Lab and Dem had done some work on some AI projects. When Demis reached out to ask if there was a camera crew available to document the tournament coming up in Seoul and could the Creative Lab send anyone over, and because Greg had done work at Creative Lab, as well, we knew he was a trusted filmmaker and we should definitely document the tournament. But we should also go to London in the weeks prior to document code lock just so there’s a more complete story, and by day two in Seoul we knew there was more than a complete story here. This wasn’t just documenting an event; there’s actually a feature film here. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEric McClanahan - What is amazing is that it sounds like you guys got into this story \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ein medias res\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e and discovered all this rich backstory, but there’s also a prescience to your involvement because now they’re Nobel Prize winners. Did you see the potential for this phenomenon growing to that level?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg title=\"Ladies and Gentlemen, Your Nobel Prize Winners\" src=\"https://media.aintitcool.com/media/_versions/article_images_2022/mceric/nobel_prize_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Ladies and Gentlemen, Your Nobel Prize Winners\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreg Kohs - Well, interestingly, when we began filming/following AlphaGo, we took up a mission to continue documenting kind of behind the curtain at DeepMind with the different research threads that were going on, and there are many. We had full access to the lab, anywhere we wanted to go, we were cleared. We just couldn’t share with any of the other teams, like the team we were just interviewing or speaking to, because it was all very confidential. But one of those teams we encountered was this group of ragtag researchers, scientists, who were taking up this challenge to create an algorithm that would help realize the structures of proteins, or in other words, fold a protein. We had no idea what that was, but we did some research and learned that if this 50-year-old grand challenge could be solved, then for whoever solved it, it would be potentially a Nobel-worthy achievement. It was at that point on our filmmakers’ bulletin board that we added a notecard with a sharpie doodle of what looked like a medal, though we never used the word “Nobel.” We called it “ABBA,” that was our code name, because all these tech people love their code names, so our code name as “ABBA” so as not to jinx it and not let anyone know our outrageous expectation. Including Demis, too. He’d ask “What’s that card?” and we’d say “Oh, that’s ABBA.” So, yeah, we did know that if they achieve their goal it could happen; it wasn’t guaranteed but it could happen. And that was about six years before it actually did happen. It happened well within the first year we were filming. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGary Krieg - I would add, day one of filming the AlphaFold team, though, no. [Laughs] There was no expectation that that was going to lead to a Nobel. It just seemed this insurmountable problem that it would take many, many years before they made any progress.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreg Kohs - Yeah, there was more head-scratching filmed than anything else, the whole time. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEric McClanahan - It is an amazing progression they’d made at DeepMind with AlphaFold, AlphaGo, and AlphaZero, which learned from itself. Speaking of learning, what was the learning curve for you as filmmakers going into a science that’s this deep? Did you feel bewildered the whole while or did you just do a lot of homework?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreg Kohs - Well, for me, personally, I was clueless on so much of this; the science, that is. So we’d be filming and we’d hear terms and then you’d go back to your hotel room and Google it to try to figure out what was just said or you’d look over the transcript of a meeting. So, yeah, it was challenging, especially when it came to proteins. Once we learned about this team and the implications of if they were able to solve this problem, we did a deep dive. I don’t think we could have PhDs, but we tried. And we almost learned too much because our earlier cuts were way too over the heads of our test audiences. Then we had to really pare it back. But our favorite question when talking to these scientists, or way of framing a question, was always “Explain it to me like a five-year-old.” Which was just saying explain it to me so I can understand it because I felt that’s about where my brain was when talking to them. So, that was very helpful, and they worked hard with us to make it understandable.
