  "text": "“The Brutalist” is about to get even bigger (though hopefully no longer). A24 and IMAX have finalized a deal to bring “The Brutalist” to IMAX screens, the studio announced Wednesday. The film will be available for one-night early access screenings on December 18 at the AMC Lincoln Square in NY and the AMC Century City in Los Angeles, and it will then expand to IMAX screens nationwide throughout January. A24 quite recently announced 70mm screenings of “The Brutalist,” which IndieWire understands have all nearly sold out rapidly. The IMAX screenings — unlike in the case of something like “Oppenheimer” — will not be on 70mm film prints. “For me, there is no greater cinematic tool than Large Format Capture, and there is no greater canvas than IMAX,” Corbet said in a statement. “I am thrilled for audiences to have the opportunity to discover Lol Crawley’s exquisite Cinematography, Steve Single’s meticulous Sound Mix, and Daniel Blumberg’s indelible score in the way it was intended to be experienced. Maximum Volume Yields Maximum Results.” Popular on IndieWire It’s a boon for A24’s Oscar contender and especially its box office ambitions by getting the IMAX bump in an especially crowded holiday corridor for other tentpoles, as films like “Mufasa: The Lion King” and “Nosferatu” should also be screening on IMAX. “The Brutalist” has already been championed by a number of film critic groups, specifically the New York Film Critics Circle naming it Best Film, and is rapidly becoming one of the awards season frontrunners. The film stars Adrien Brody as visionary architect László Toth as he attempts to rebuild his life in Post-War America. Initially forced to toil in poverty, Toth soon wins a contract that will change the course of the next 30 years of his life. A24 has had a number of films screen in IMAX, including the Talking Heads concert film “Stop Making Sense,” Joel Coen’s “The Tragedy of Macbeth” with Apple, and had some limited releases of “Everything Everywhere All At Once” and “Beau Is Afraid” on the biggest IMAX screens. But this one represents one of its biggest partnerships yet with the large format brand. Tickets for the December 18 showings are available now at imax.com/brutalist.",
