Veikoso captivated audiences as a reggae pioneer, songwriter, and producer who defined contemporary Pacific music. Since his debut in the 80s, Fiji’s infectious rhythms and soulful voice have created an irreplaceable legacy. He gained popularity for “Let Me Be the One,” the theme song of Baywatch Season 11. So, what happened to Veikoso? Here are all the details fans need to know regarding the same. George ‘Fiji’ Veikoso passes away at 55, claims report As per reports, George Brooks Veikoso, better known by his stage name “Fiji,” passed away at 55. According to Hawaii News Now, the artist was surrounded by family at the time of his demise. While there aren’t many details regarding his untimely passing, reports claim the musician took his last breath in his home nation, Fiji. Many of Veikoso’s colleagues came forward to pay tribute to his life and work. Singer Kimie Miner, who considered him her mentor, told the outlet, “(His passing) really hurt me because it just felt like I couldn’t call on my mentor anymore, and he’s not there anymore. It made me so sad to know that he’s gone, but his legacy is so big that I know his legacy will carry on forever.” Meanwhile, musician Kelly Boy DeLima called Veikoso his “Boso”, which means brother in Fijian. In an emotional Instagram post, he wrote, “I have always been your biggest fan. You will be so missed. Love you, Boso. Til we meet again.” George “Fiji” Veikoso began his music journey as a child and entered the industry in 1987 with the Fijian band Rootstrata. Political unrest forced him to move to Hawaii the same year. There, Veikoso had a new beginning as he released his debut album, Evolution, in 1994. It featured several hit tracks like “Lia,” “Good Thang,” and “Symphony of Love.” Within two years of his first album, Veikoso earned the chart-topper status when he released the album Born \u0026 Raised in 1996. His impact as a true pioneer of the Pacific reggae scene got its true recognition through several awards. Veikoso received a Na Hoku Hanohano Award (1998), a Pacific Music Award (2014), and a Lifetime Achievement Award (2021). In 2024, he hosted the FIJI HOMECOMING concert, drawing thousands and featuring major Hawaiian artists.",
