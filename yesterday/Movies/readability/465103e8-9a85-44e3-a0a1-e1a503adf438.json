Whoa! This looks radical - uber weird and wacky and twisted and strange. What is all of this? What's up with all the goats? Why does this look so dang cool? Who's down? Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Apple TV+'s series Severance - Season 2, direct from YouTube: You can rewatch the teaser trailer for Apple TV+'s Severance - Season 2 right here, for the first look again. Mark Scout (Adam Scott) leads a team working at Lumon Industries, whose employees have undergone a severance procedure, which surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This daring experiment in \"work-life balance\" is called into question as Mark finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work... and of himself. In season two, Mark and his friends learn the dire consequences of trifling with the severance barrier, leading them further down a path of woe. Severance is a series created and written by Dan Erickson, also a producer on the \"Chambers\" TV series. With writing by Anna Ouyang Moench, Mohamad El Masri, Wei-Ning Yu, and Erin Wagoner. And episodes directed again by Ben Stiller, along with Uta Briesewitz and Samuel Donova. Executive produced by John Lesher, Jackie Cohn, Mark Friedman, Beau Willimon, Jordan Tappis, Donovan, Caroline Baron, Richard Schwartz, Nicholas Weinstock, Scott and Arquette. Apple TV will debut Severance - Season 2 streaming on Apple TV+ starting on January 17th, 2025 early next year. Who's ready for more? Find more posts in: Sci-Fi, Streaming, To Watch, Trailer",
