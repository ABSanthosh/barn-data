  "text": "“Jury Duty” has been summoned once again. The comedy series, which debuted on Amazon’s now-defunct streamer Freevee as a surprise hit in 2023, will run for a second season on Amazon Prime Video, Variety has learned from sources. Amazon did not comment on the renewal. Additionally, a source tells Variety that Season 2 will be set at a corporate retreat rather than a courtroom, and that it was shot in the Los Angeles suburb of Agoura Hills. Amazon did not comment on this information. Season 1 of the documentary-style project followed Ronald Gladden’s journey as a juror during a trial that gets increasingly more dysfunctional until it’s finally revealed that the entire case is fake and everyone besides him is a paid actor. When asked by Variety about potential future seasons, “Jury Duty” showrunner Cody Heller said, “Obviously, it would have to be a whole different universe. You couldn’t just do jury duty again, because then people would be like, ‘Wait a second.’ But I do think that it’s possible. I do think there’s a million different worlds that this kind of thing could exist in.” Executive producers David Bernad and Todd Schulman concurred with that idea in another Variety interview. Popular on Variety “Jury Duty” was created by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, who executive produced Season 1 alongside Heller, Bernad, Schulman, Ruben Fleischer, Nicholas Hatton, Andrew Weinberg and director Jake Szymanski. Along with Marsden, the Season 1 cast included Mekki Leeper, Alan Barinholtz, Rashida “Sheedz” Olayiwola, Susan Berger, Cassandra Blair, David Brown, Kirk Fox, Ross Kimball, Pramode Kumar, Trisha LaFache, Brandon Loeser, Edy Modica, Kerry O’Neill, Whitney Rice, Maria Russell, Ishmel Sahid, Ben Seaward, Ron Song and Evan Williams. After the success of “Jury Duty” — which ended with Gladden happily embracing the prank — Amazon set an overall deal with Gladden, who will work with the studio to produce, develop and star in content across platforms.",
