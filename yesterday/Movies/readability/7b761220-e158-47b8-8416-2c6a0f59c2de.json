  "text": "Netflix has released the first Happy Gilmore 2 teaser trailer for the upcoming Adam Sandler sequel. The 45-second video also features the return of Christopher McDonald as the villainous golfer Shooter McGavin. No release date was set, but the film is said to be “coming soon” in 2025. Check out the Happy Gilmore 2 teaser trailer below (watch more trailers): Who is in the Happy Gilmore 2 cast? In Happy Gilmore 2, Sandler returns as the titular Happy, a former hockey player who turns to golf when he needs to raise money to save his grandmother’s house. Happy’s unorthodox golf swing and rowdy etiquette shake up the PGA Tour, and he quickly becomes a fan favorite. Besides Sandler and Stiller, the actors reprising their roles from Happy Gilmore for the sequel include Christopher McDonald as Shooter McGavin, Happy’s chief rival and fellow golfer on the PGA Tour, and Julie Bowen as Virginia Venit, a PR director and Happy’s love interest. Newcomers set to appear in the Happy Gilmore 2 cast include Benito Martínez Ocasio (Bad Bunny), Nick Swardson, Benny Safdie, Margaret Qualley, Maxwell Jacob Friedman (AEW star MJF), Scott Mescudi (Kid Cudi), Travis Kelce, and John Daly. Kyle Newacheck (Murder Mystery) is directing Happy Gilmore 2 from a script co-written by Sandler and Tim Herlihy. Producers include Sandler, Herlihy, Robert Simonds, and Jack Giarraputo. While the first film came from Universal Studios, Happy Gilmore 2 is a Netflix production. Released in 1996, Happy Gilmore was one of Sandler’s first movie star roles post-Saturday Night Live. The golf comedy grossed over $41 million against a $12 million budget. Happy Gilmore 2 is currently in production. The film will stream on Netflix at a later date.",
