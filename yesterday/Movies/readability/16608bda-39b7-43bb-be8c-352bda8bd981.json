  "text": "Sony and Marvel Studios’ new untitled Spider-Man with Tom Holland and from Destin Daniel Cretton is going a week later on July 31 instead of July 24 in 2026. What’s so special about July 31 over July 24? It’s the last Friday in July, which essentially where Marvel Studios’ Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine played to an opening of $211.4M domestic, $444.7M worldwide. There’s something else though: Spidey on its old date was going in the immediate week wake of Christopher Nolan’s new Matt Damon movie The Odyssey on July 17 from Universal. On its new date, Spidey is two weeks from Nolan’s feature take of the Homer epic, and now going up against Spin Master/Paramount’s Paw Patrol 3. It can also be inferred that Nolan will at least get his fair share of Imax screens — for about two weeks. Likely another reason why Spider-Man moved. Watch on Deadline Amy Pascal and Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige are back as producers. Zendaya is expected to return, but her deal is still in the works. No word on who else is returning from the old gang, i.e. Jon Favreau and Jacob Batalon. The only person not coming back is Marisa Tomei because her character Aunt May passed away in the previous installment. The three Tom Holland Spider-Man Sony-Disney Marvel Studios movies have minted close to $4 billion alone. Including ten movies, as well as the two animated Spider-Verse movies, Sony’s entire Spider-Man franchise counts $9 billion at the global box office. Cretton’s Disney/Marvel Studios’ Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings grossed $432.2M at the global box office. The movie owns the biggest opening for Labor Day weekend at $94.6M stateside.",
