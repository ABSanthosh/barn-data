  "description": "\"We lost our grandma! Who loses their grandma?!\" Disney+ has revealed the official trailer for a comedy movie called Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Road Trip, a sort of spin-off / remake movie inspired by the original Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day movie. The iconic book that this is based on (written by Judith Viorst) was also turned into a cheesy Disney movie in 2014 that got pretty bad / mixed reviews. This next one follows a Mexican American family who have recently lost their connection to each other and their roots, as they embark on an epic road trip that immediately goes hilariously wrong. The new comedy, which stars Eva Longoria, Jesse Garcia, Paulina Chávez, Rose Portillo, Cristo Fernández, Harvey Guillén, Mabel Cadena, Michelle Buteau, and introducing Thom Nemer, with Cheech Marin (hell yes), is directed by Marvin Lemus and written by Matt Lopez. D+ is releasing it streaming in March, skipping theaters entirely for home. This looks like it wants to be another National Lampoon's Vacation but is still nowhere near as funny as that comedy classic.
