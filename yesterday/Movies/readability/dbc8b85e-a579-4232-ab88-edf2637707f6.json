Variety’s senior artisans editor Jazz Tangcay highlighted the “flawless” craft of the film, with its sound, score and cinematography. \"It's Pearce, down the insideeeee\" WOW! @F1Movie is an action-packed thrilling look at the world of F1 racing, with lots of grit. The sound, score and cinematography are flawless. Damson Idris and Brad Pitt are great! Absolutely Obsessedddddd pic.twitter.com/3nrveb8lbT— Jazz Tangcay (@jazzt) June 5, 2025 Variety’s chief awards editor Clayton Davis also had high praise for the lensing, shouting out DP Claudio Miranda, who earned an Oscar nomination for his work on director Joseph Kosinski‘s last feature “Top Gun: Maverick.” #F1TheMovie is the Jerry and Joe Show! Bruckheimer and Kosinski really do make audacious entertainment together. Academy…don't do Claudio Miranda dirty again on this one. Brad Pitt and Damson Idris shine brightest when sharing the screen. Race to see this one in IMAX pic.twitter.com/aO870ttLlU— Clayton Davis (@ByClaytonDavis) June 5, 2025 The Nerdist and Breakroom contributor Maude Garrett called the movie “so freaking good” and hypothesized if she would’ve liked it even more if she were even a fan of F1 racing in the first place. Popular on Variety #F1TheMovie is so freaking good. It has all the adrenaline, heart, pacing, story and character that completely fleshes out this movie into excellence. I can only imagine how much MORE I would love this movie if I was a fan of F1 racing! 🏎️ 💨 Maybe I am now?@F1Movie pic.twitter.com/nfXunN0L44— Maude Garrett (@maudegarrett) June 5, 2025 Pitt headlines “F1” as Sonny Hayes, a retired Formula One driver who suffered a terrible crash in his past. He’s convinced to come out of retirement and train a rookie prodigy, played by Damson Idris, for the Apex Grand Prix race. Kosinski, who directed Tom Cruise in the high-flying blockbuster “Top Gun: Maverick,” helmed the film with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and real-life Formula One superstar Lewis Hamilton. The supporting cast includes Javier Bardem and Kerry Condon. During a virtual press conference earlier this year, Kosinski discussed the making of the film, explaining that he became a fan of Formula 1 racing after discovering Netflix’s “Drive to Survive” series during the COVID pandemic. “I loved how the first season of the show focused on the last place teams, the underdogs, rather than the Ferrari, the Mercedes, the Red Bull, the teams that you see at the front of the pack,” he said. “I thought that there was an interesting story to be told about an underdog team trying — not to win the championship — but just trying to win one race against these titans of the sport.” Kosinski and his actors traveled the F1 circuit over the course of a year in order to film at the real races. He explained: “We get these 10 or 15 minute slots where we’d have to have Brad and Damson ready in the cars, warmed up with hot tires ready to go, and as soon as practice ended, they would pull out onto the track. We’d have 24, 30 cameras ready, rolling, and I’d have to shoot these scenes in these very short, intense, high-speed windows. But the crowd you’re seeing was really there in the stands. I don’t think the crowd realized that Brad Pitt was in the car that was in front of them.” “F1” opens in theaters June 27 from Apple and Warner Bros. See more reactions below. Buckle up #F1TheMovie is an high octane thrill ride. It’s one of those films that you go to the movies for. Brad Pitt and Damson Idris are both dynamic. This is top gun for F1 racing fans. Truly a racing movie for a new generation. pic.twitter.com/AkuNytTlGA— B E A N Z 🔜 Summer Game Fest (@BeanzGotGamez) June 5, 2025 Joseph Kosinski’s #F1TheMovie hits the gas and doesn’t stop. The races are epic, the sound design, editing, cinematography, performances and music are all top notch. You definitely feel shades of TOP GUN MAVERICK in that it plays like an old school summer blockbuster. What a ride pic.twitter.com/XSy4c74Gpe— Erik Davis (@ErikDavis) June 5, 2025",
