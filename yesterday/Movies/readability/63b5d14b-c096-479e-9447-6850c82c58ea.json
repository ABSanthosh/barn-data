  "text": "Even Superman gets hurt. On a recent episode of Vanity Fair’s “Lie Detector Test,” David Corenswet, while hooked up to a polygraph, was asked by co-star Nicholas Hoult about the “wildest bruise” he got while starring in “Superman.” Corenswet said while filming an “epic” flying scene with a harness, he got a bruise on his “right testicle.” “There’s footage from filming of me getting pulled through the air,” Corenswet explained. “It’s this wonderful epic moment. It’s in the trailer, the beginning of it, where I stand up and punch the glass out and then I leap out the window and fly through the air. And on the first take of that, it’s this big epic punch and a leap through the air, and then just, ‘My testicle!'” Popular on Variety A laughing Hoult then replied, “I want to ask you more questions about your testicles, but I don’t know where to go that’s appropriate.” Corenswet and Hoult headline James Gunn’s “Superman” as the titular Man of Steel and Lex Luthor, respectively. Other cast members include Rachel Brosnahan (Lois Lane), Skyler Gisondo (Jimmy Olsen), Anthony Carrigan (Metamorpho), Edi Gathegi (Mister Terrific), Nathan Fillon (Guy Gardner) and Isabela Merced (Hawkgirl). In his review of the DC tentpole, Variety film critic Owen Gleiberman praised the film for taking a more traditional approach to the superhero blockbuster. “‘Superman,’ James Gunn’s exuberant and popping reboot, makes a very smart play,” he wrote. “Gunn, the bountiful blockbuster craftsman of the ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’ films, wrote and directed ‘Superman,’ which is the first cinematic missile launched by Warner Bros.’ all-new DC Universe (of which Gunn is also the co-executive overseer). Gunn knows that the world has grown weary of comic-book film culture, and in the new ‘Superman’ he’s out to reset not just one studio’s fortunes but the very idea of what a comic-book movie is.” “Superman” is in theaters now.",
