The Basketball Wives LA star’s video amid the tragic wildfires also prompted the air purifier company to release a statement. Here is what the social media users felt after seeing Michele’s video online. The popular media personality posted a video of her unboxing and setting up an air purifier from the company, Sereniby, leading to backlash from social media users. Draya Michele paired the aforementioned clip on Instagram with a caption in which she expressed her sorrow about the wildfires in Los Angeles. She wrote, “While the unimaginable is happening with the fires in LA… air quality is so poor, toxic even.” Michele further added that to combat the toxic air quality she is installing Sereniby’s air purifier for her kids and pets. The Perfect Match actress stated, “I’m using the @sereniby_official air purifier to ensure that my kids and pets are breathing in fresh, double-filtered air.” She also stated that customers can get a discount of $200 if they purchase through the link in her Instagram bio. However, this video didn’t sit well with Instagram users. While Michele has limited comments on the post, as per Bossip, several netizens called her out. “Draya using the LA fires. To promote an air purifier on her Instagram. Like she never does anything right. Tone deaf af,” wrote one user. After Draya Michele’s post went viral on Instagram, Sereniby, the air purifier company, also released a statement. They disclosed she wasn’t “compensated for her post.” According to People, furthermore, the company asserted, “She and her team contacted us because she genuinely uses the product and believed it could help others dealing with the severe air quality in Los Angeles…We’re donating 10% of our January profits to the American Red Cross, and we recognize there are countless urgent needs in this crisis.”",
