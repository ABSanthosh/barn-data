  "text": "More than 20 years later, Lindsay Lohan is getting the band back together for Freakier Friday. In the upcoming sequel to her 2003 Disney film, which premieres Aug. 8, 2025 in theaters, Lohan’s character Anna Coleman will reunite with her high school garage band Pink Slip, which also consisted of pals Maddie (Christina Vidal) and Peg (Haley Hudson). “Pink Slip is back together, the band. Yes!” Lohan recently told Jimmy Fallon as she appeared on The Tonight Show. The announcement comes after Vidal and Hudson were previously confirmed to reprise their roles in the sequel. Watch on Deadline “We just finished [filming] in August,” she said. “It’s just been such a labor of love to make happen. And Jamie [Lee Curtis] and I, even at the table read, we were just smiling so big. I don’t think we were acting well, because we were so happy. But the movie’s funny, it’s really funny.” Lohan’s appearance came after Curtis revealed that her onscreen daughter performs what is sure to become a “monster hit” in the movie.

(Buena Vista Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection) “I’m telling you right now, this one played a song last night at the Wiltern and it is in my ear like one of those Star Trek earworms,” Curtis told Entertainment Weekly in August. “I’m telling you, it’s going to be a monster hit. I’m not going to tell you what it’s called because we’re in the middle of making it, but there are some old favorites played in this movie.” In Freaky Friday, the pair starred as single mother Tess and teen daughter Anna Coleman, who switch bodies after opening an enchanted fortune cookie and have to walk a day in each other’s shoes before getting back to normal. Written by Jordan Weiss and directed by Nisha Ganatra, the sequel sees Anna all grown up with a daughter of her own while also preparing to take on a stepdaughter in her new marriage. With her new family dynamic, a new version of the body swap will ensue. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan in Freaky Friday (2003).

The duo revealed the sequel’s title at the D23 Expo in August, where Lohan raved that the movie is “more fun, it’s more emotional, and it’s all for you guys.” Manny Jacinto, Julia Butters, Sophia Hammons and Maitreyi Ramakrishnan have been cast in the sequel, along with returning cast members Chad Michael Murray, Mark Harmon, Lucille Soong, Stephen Tobolowsky and Rosalind Chao.",
