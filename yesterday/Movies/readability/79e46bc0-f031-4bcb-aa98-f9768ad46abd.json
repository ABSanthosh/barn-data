Actor emphasizes excitement despite delays, calling the film a passion project for Universal. Fast \u0026 Furious franchise's 10 films have surpassed $7 billion at the box office. Fast X earned over $700 million, proving the franchise's lasting appeal to audiences. After becoming a strong asset to the beloved Fast \u0026 Furious franchise as Agent Aimes in Fast X, actor Alan Ritchson has ignited excitement among fans regarding his potential return in the upcoming eleventh installment. However, as expected, it will take a little more time before we get another film. In a recent interview with Screen Rant, Ritchson discussed the challenges of coordinating schedules for such a star-studded ensemble but also expressed his enthusiasm for reprising his role. \"We talk about it quite often,\" Ritchson revealed to the outlet. \"That is one of the biggest challenges that franchise faces are that you've got a lot of guys like Dwayne and Vin and Momoa and myself and everybody's super busy. So trying to get the stars to align so we can make that happen is a feat of nature.\" Despite the scheduling complications, he also emphasized the dedication behind the project, calling it \"a passion project for Universal,\" the studio behind the franchise, and admitted that he is eager to return to the world of Fast \u0026 Furious if (and when) things finally align.

Editorial credit: Kathy Hutchins / Shutterstock.com Fast \u0026 Furious Franchise Box Office Numbers and Growing Popularity Across its current slate of 10 films, the Fast \u0026 Furious franchise is typically known for its ensemble cast and high-octane action, accumulating more than $7 billion during theatrical releases. While the earlier installments weren't met with a plethora of praise, the franchise has since become a classic, enlisting some of the biggest names in the action scene. In fact, Fast X actually managed to rake in more than $700 million alone, solidifying the notion that this franchise is still very much relevant to modern audiences. Still, based on Ritchson's comments about it being a priority for Universal and the clear popularity attached to Fast \u0026 Furious, do you think we're still getting a sequel in the next few years? Let us know your thoughts about the potential for more Fast \u0026 Furious films in the comment section. Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!
