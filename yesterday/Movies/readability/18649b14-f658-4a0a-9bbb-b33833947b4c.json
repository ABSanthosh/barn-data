If you've never seen 8½, there's no better way to experience it than by catching it on 35mm at your local art house cinema. Here's the new official 2025 trailer (+ poster) for Federico Fellini's all-timer classic 8½, from YouTube: Marcello Mastroianni plays Guido Anselmi, a director whose new project is collapsing around him, along with his life. Guido is a successful Italian film director, trying to relax after his last big hit. He can't get a moment's peace, however, with the people who have worked with him in the past constantly looking for more work. He wrestles with his conscience, but is unable to come up with a new idea. While thinking, he starts to recall major happenings in his life, and all the women he has loved and left. An autobiographical film of Fellini, about the trials and tribulations of filmmaking... 8½ is directed by Italian master filmmaker Federico Fellini, his seventh feature film at the time just after making La Dolce Vita (1960) and before making Juliet of the Spirits (1965). The screenplay is by Federico Fellini \u0026 Tullio Pinelli \u0026 Ennio Flaiano \u0026 Brunello Rondi Produced by Angelo Rizzoli. The film originally premiered for the first time ever at the 1963 Acapulco Film Festival in Mexico, then opened in Italy in early 1963 and in the US later in that same year. Janus Films is re-release Fellini's 8½ with a brand new 35mm print - playing on a tour at theaters around the US this year. Starting at Film Forum in NYC on April 25th, 2025.
