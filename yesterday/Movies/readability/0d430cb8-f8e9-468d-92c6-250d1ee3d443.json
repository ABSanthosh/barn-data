  "text": "The NBA said it is postponing the Los Angeles Lakers‘ home game Thursday against the Charlotte Hornets as the city continues to grapple with a swath of wildfires that have forced evacuations of nearly 180,000 and destroyed thousands of homes. There’s no new date for the game yet. “The entire NBA family sends its thoughts and support to the community of Los Angeles during this challenging time,” the league said on its website today. “We are grateful for the thousands of local firefighters and first responders who have demonstrated enormous bravery. Our prayers remain with those affected by the unimaginable devastation caused by the wildfires.” Lakers coach JJ Redick said before the Lakers’ game in Dallas on Tuesday that his family was among those evacuated in the Pacific Palisades, where fire has consumed more than 17,000 acres after starting that morning. As of this morning there is still 0% containment. Watch on Deadline “Our family, my wife’s family, my wife’s twin sister, they’ve evacuated. I know a lot of people are freaking out right now, including my family,” he said Tuesday. “From the sound of things, with the winds coming (Tuesday night), I know a lot of people are scared. So I just want to acknowledge that. Thoughts and prayers for sure, and hope everybody stays safe.” The Lakers’ next home game in their downtown Crypto.com Arena is Saturday night against San Antonio, while the Los Angeles Clippers are set to play a home game at Inglewood’s Intuit Dome that night against the Hornets. Both games are still on the schedule. In addition, the NFL announced late Thursday that Monday’s playoff game between the Los Angeles Rams and Minnesota Vikings, which was to be played at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, will instead move to State Farm Stadium in Glendale, AZ, home of the Arizona Cardinals. The game will be televised on ESPN/ABC/ESPN+ at its scheduled 8 pm ET time. The impact of the fires, fueled by severe Santa Ana winds and ultra-dry conditions, had already resulted in the postponement of the NHL’s Los Angeles Kings-Calgary Flames game Wednesday. They are now on an East Coast swing and don’t return home until January 20.
