  "description": "\"You'll never be alone out here - there's too many voices.\" Quiver Distr. has revealed an official trailer for a Canadian indie sci-fi film titled The Silent Planet, made by filmmaker Jeffrey St. Jules. That title reminds me of another underrated sci-fi indie film called Silent Running (from 1972) with Bruce Dern. This new film follows two inmates in the near future who are sentenced to a lifetime of hard labor on a distant planet. As things unravel, they become increasingly paranoid and start to lose a sense of who they are and their past lives. The film premiered at the 2024 Fantasia Film Festival last year and will be on VOD in March: \"Known for his surreal approach to his subject matter, [director Jeffrey] St. Jules explores what the future of Earth would look like if we included aliens as a part of immigration policies. This contemplative film is light years away from bombastic space operas, exploring regret, redemption, and redress as two people come together in the worst situation and face a horrible truth.\" Very interesting. The Silent Planet stars Elias Koteas and Briana Middleton as the two, with Bridget Wareham and Justin Nurse. Sci-fi fans should take […]",

The Silent Planet stars Elias Koteas and Briana Middleton as the two, with Bridget Wareham and Justin Nurse. Sci-fi fans should take a look. Here's the full official trailer (+ poster) for Jeffrey St. Jules' sci-fi film The Silent Planet, from YouTube: This sci-fi thriller tells the story of Theodore, a terminally ill convict serving out a life sentence alone on a silent planet. With every passing day his memories of earth become foggier. When a new prisoner, Niyya, arrives, he is excited to have a companion, but she just wants to be left alone. His persistence eventually wins her over until a foggy memory comes back to him – he thinks his real name may be Nathan. This is the name of the rogue soldier who killed Niyya's family when she was a child. If he is the same man, he seems to have completely lost his memory of this event. As she pushes him to remember what he did, he believes that she is messing with his head for nefarious reasons. She believes there is a greater conspiracy that brought them together. As they both become increasingly paranoid, they decide that their only chance at survival is to kill the other first. Leading to a one-on-one battle across the eerie landscape of the planet. The Silent Planet is written and directed by Canadian indie genre filmmaker Jeffrey St. Jules, director of Bang Bang Baby and Cinema of Sleep previously, plus many other shorts. Produced by Andrew Bronfman and Mark O'Neill. This first premiered at the 2024 Fantasia Film Festival last year. Quiver will debut Jeffrey St. Jules' The Silent Planet film direct-to-VOD in the US starting March 7th, 2025 coming up. Look good? Find more posts in: Indies, Sci-Fi, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
