In an Instagram post from Kudrow and her “No Good Deed” creator Liz Feldman, Romano is seen approaching the “Friends” couch, saying, “Everybody forgets that ‘Everybody Loves Raymond’ filmed on Warner Bros. too. So I just want to make sure they remember.” “It’s not all about ‘Friends.’ We were two stages down. You gotta go visit our stage,” Romano tells the group of tourists before posing for photos with them. “Go sit on your own show’s couch!” Kudrow shouts at Romano, joining the gathering and drawing a more awestruck response from the group. “Now he just always comes to this couch because he wants more attention.” Popular on Variety The cameos were part of a promotion for Kudrow and Romano’s new show “No Good Deed,” a dark comedy from “Dead to Me” creator Feldman. The actors star as a couple that put their Los Angeles villa on the real estate market and work to mask the abode’s dark secrets to a litany of potential buyers. All eight episodes premiered on Netflix on Dec. 12. In Variety’s review of “No Good Deed,” chief TV critic Alison Herman wrote that the series “features such a solid setup and such a stacked cast that its overreliance on twists can be counterproductive.” “I’ll just say that I always had a Season 2 in mind, and I do think that a show like this has legs if it is done in a clever way,” Feldman told Variety in an interview covering the season finale. “I’m very excited to sit down and talk to Netflix about what those plans are. They know a little bit, but I do think that this show has some life left to live, and I really hope that we get to see it through.”",
