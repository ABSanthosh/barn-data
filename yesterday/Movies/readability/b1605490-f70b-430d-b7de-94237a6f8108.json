In the small town of Clover Falls, Abbie’s father, Roger Bladecut (Billy Burke, TWILIGHT), has built an infamous legacy by capturing real-life killings on tape and selling them to eager customers, but as Abbie delves deeper into the grisly family business, she begins to wonder if it’s time to take the family tradition in a new direction.  The conceit of the film is surprisingly fresh in a genre that finds new ways to reinvent itself with shocking regularity.

Set within the confines of a horror film, we see what it might be like to grow up in a family where the patriarch is a serial killer/slasher who rises from the grave everytime a brave teen succeeds in fighting back... to a point. Roger Bladecut is aging out of effectiveness, and while at first Abbie thinks she's the logical successor, getting to actually know her victims before swinging the axe has her seeing things differently. I was able to talk to producer Hilarie Burton Morgan and co-star Molly Brown about crafting a story with strong female characters and bringing as much talent behind the camera as in front. In a move that I've been contemplating for a while that's a win-win-win, I am not transcribing this interview (win for me), so you get to see the actual interview subjects (win for you) and sometimes my cat jumps into the frame when I do these things (also win for you, though she doesn't do so this time, but you can make a drinking game of it as we move forward). The small price you must pay is watching me try to form sentences. Thanks to Hilarie Burton Morgan (whom I figured out is actually Jeffrey Dean Morgan's wife after the interview) and Molly Brown for chatting with me about this fresh and fun horror ride, and I invite you all to check it out when it releases in theaters December 27th, 2024 or you can wait until it hits the streaming service next year. Either way, definitely check it out and let us know what you think. Until next time, enjoy this week of purgatory before 2025 becomes a reality and I hope it brings you everything you desire! Take scare! -McEric, aka Eric McClanahan-",
