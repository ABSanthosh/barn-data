  "text": "Adam Sandler is giving a tongue in cheek tribute to the late “Happy Gilmore” alligator Morris, who died at an estimated age of 80. In the iconic 1996 comedy, Morris infamously is confronted by Sandler’s golfing character Happy; Morris grabs a golf ball on the green, leading Happy to realize that it is the same gator who chomped on the hand of his mentor, Chubbs (Carl Weathers). “Goodbye, Morris. We are all gonna miss you,” Sandler tweeted after the news of Morris’ passing was made public Monday, May 12. “You could be hard on directors, make-up artists, costumers — really anyone with arms or legs — but I know you did it for the ultimate good of the film.” Sandler continued, “The day you wouldn’t come out of your trailer unless we sent in 40 heads of lettuce taught me a powerful lesson: Never compromise your art. I will never forget at craft service that time when we split the Three Musketeers bar and you let me have the bigger half. But that’s who you were.” While Morris was not going to star in the upcoming “Happy Gilmore 2,” which will be released on Netflix July 25, Sandler still recalled how much the animal actor was missed on set. “I know your character’s decapitation in the first movie precluded your participation in the sequel, but we all appreciated the fruit basket and the hilarious note,” he quipped. “I will miss the sound of your tail sliding through the tall grass, your cold, bumpy skin, but, most of all, I will miss your infectious laugh. Thanks to Mr. Young for taking care of you all these years, and vaya con dios, old friend.” Morris even landed a NYT obituary. The 640-pound, 11-foot alligator worked in Hollywood from 1975 to 2006, with roles in the “Alligator” films, “Dr. Doolittle 2,” “Interview With the Vampire” (1994), and “Blues Brothers 2000.” He also appeared on “The Jay Leno Show” with late animal wrangler Steve Irwin. His career first started after being discovered in a private residential Los Angeles backyard, where he was kept as an illegal pet. Morris retired to the Colorado Gator Farm in Mosca, CO. The alligator died of old age, as a representative for the Colorado Gator Farm said. “His exact age was unknown, but he was nine feet long in 1975, and by his growth rate and tooth loss, we can estimate his age at over 80 years,” the farm said. “We have decided to get Morris taxidermied so that he can continue to scare children for years to come. It’s what he would have wanted.” Goodbye, Morris. We are all gonna miss you. You could be hard on directors, make-up artists, costumers – really anyone with arms or legs – but I know you did it for the ultimate good of the film. The day you wouldn’t come out of your trailer unless we sent in 40 heads of lettuce… pic.twitter.com/iQlkne4fwJ— Adam Sandler (@AdamSandler) May 14, 2025",
