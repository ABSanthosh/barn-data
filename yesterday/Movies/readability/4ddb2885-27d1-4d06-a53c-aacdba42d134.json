  "text": "Posted in: HBO, Max, Movies, Pop Culture, TV | Tagged: BatmanWe didn't expect a State Farm ad with Jason Bateman to also give us some great takes on Batman, the Joker, Catwoman, and more (seriously). More often than not, when Madison Avenue starts poking around the geek universe for advertising ideas, what we end up getting is something that comes across as cringey, trying too hard, or being made by folks who have no clue what they're dealing with. That definitely can not be said about whichever marketing firm came up with the idea of crossing over the DC Universe and State Farm insurance with – Jason Bateman?!? In the extended look (waiting for you above), State Farm equates going with another insurance company with getting \"Bate-man\" (Bateman) instead of Batman (the voice of Will Arnett, who gets in a great podcast dig) to help save Gotham. In addition, we have SZA as Catwoman, Jordan Howlett as Commissioner James Gordon, and Kai Cenat as Kai Cenat (but in a whole lot of trouble). But it's the overall look of the commercial that's actually… pretty great. We got some impressive looks at The Riddler, Two-Face, and Poison Ivy – but it's the Joker that proves that sometimes, less truly is more when it comes to making The Clown Prince of Crime appear as disturbing as he needs to. Image: State Farm Screencaps Here are some screencaps from the ad – with the extended cut waiting for you above (and a look at someone who can't escape the rumor mill when it comes to playing the Dark Knight): Reacher Star Alan Ritchson On Batman Rumors Not Going Away \u0026 More It's the rumor/fan-casting dream that won't seem to die. As we all know, DC Studios CEOs James Gunn \u0026 Peter Safran's DCU is going to have its own Bruce Wayne, aka Batman – in fact, he's set for The Brave and the Bold. That's separate from what Matt Reeves has going on with his \"The Batman\" universe, which has Robert Pattinson as its Dark Knight. But on the DCU side, a name hasn't been attached to portray its version yet – but one name that's come up is Reacher star Alan Ritchson. And yet, while Gunn has given no indication whatsoever that Ritchson is even being thought about or considered, the buzz about it being a possibility is still out there – as strong as ever. Taking part in WIRED's \"The Web's Most Searched Questions,\" Ritchson addresses how he still continues to be asked about the role while reaffirming his interest in the role (and even gives us a little Batman voice along the way). \"This is a… what's amazing to me about this rumor of the Batman or the Batman desire and the zeitgeist is the fact that James Gunn has personally announced publicly on his Twitter or X or whatever, 'LOL, he's not playing Batman. He is not playing Batman!' And this thing will not die. I get asked every day if I'm playing Batman. Yeah, would I play Batman? Yes. Would I pay handsomely to be Batman? You wouldn't even have to pay me to be Batman. I would, yeah, I would don the suit. 'Gotham is mine.' Look at that. I don't even have to practice. It just comes out naturally,\" Ritchson responded. As part of a video featurette accompanying a profile interview of him by The Hollywood Reporter from April 2024, Ritchson had a chance to discuss some things he has on his \"Career Bucket List.\" In the clip above, Ritchson was asked if he would prefer to portray the Joker or Batman. Noting that he feels like Joaquin Phoenix \"crushed it\" in Joker, Ritchson made it clear that he's all-in on playing The Dark Knight. \"I would love to play Batman. There! I said it, okay? I'll shout it from the rooftops. 'I want to be Bruce Wayne!' Here's the thing about Batman – you know what his superpower is? Intelligence. Dude is the smartest superhero there is. Like, he's inventive and he's got all the gadgets stuff, but he's super smart. I want to be that guy and also to have like a cave with hypercars, sports cars, and awesome motorcycles. You saw the Ducati – I'm into that stuff.\" Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!
