  "text": "Jane Bright, the Survivor: Nicaragua contestant, has died. She was 71. The Season 21 Fan Favorite’s daughter Ashley Hammett announced her mother’s death in a Facebook post on Thursday after her body was discovered earlier that day in her North Carolina home. “Today Jane Hammett Bright was found passed away within her home by a good friend and county sheriff,” wrote Hammett in the post. A cause of death was not disclosed. Born Dec. 13, 1953 in Jackson Springs, N.C., Bright was a 56-year old dog trainer when she appeared on the CBS competition series in 2010. Separating the castaways into two tribes based on age, she started off in the older Espada tribe. Watch on Deadline Despite being the oldest contestant of the season, Bright pulled her own weight, praised for her strength and contributions to the tribe. After being the 13th castaway voted off, she won the audience-voted Sprint Fan Favorite, along with a $100,000 prize.
