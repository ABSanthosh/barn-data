  "text": "As Busy Philipps prepares for Season 2 of her QVC+ late-night talk show, she’s opening up about taking on the male-dominated time slot. The Busy This Week host recently commented on being the only woman in late-night with her series, which returns to the free streamer on May 21 at 10pm ET, as well as the need to “carve out our spaces.” “I was saying earlier, this is the dumbest glass ceiling of all time, but I’m happy to be there. But also, guys, what’s happening? I just feel like, the moment, we’ve moved past it. We’ve got to get more ladies in late-night,” said Philipps, adding: “Maybe if we can get a lady in late-night, we can get a lady in the White House.” Noting she “was bummed” after her first talk show Busy Tonight was canceled after one season on E!, Philipps also discussed finding an unexpected home for her current late-night outing. Watch on Deadline “If you can’t get a seat at the table, you gotta find a different table. And maybe it’s at a place where you can also buy the table,” she joked. “I think that we do have to be a little bit creative sometimes and carve out our spaces.” With the sophomore season of her talk show, she had the chance to interview late-night legend David Letterman. “It was a little high pressure, I’m not gonna lie. It was a little bit intense,” Philipps admitted. “But it was really fun, and I’m excited for people to see the show.” This season on Busy This Week, which is available on HSN+ as well, Philipps also welcomes guests Michelle Williams, Andrew Rannells, Chrissy Metz and more.",
