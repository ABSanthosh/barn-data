  "text": "The long-awaited “Happy Gilmore 2” celebrated its premiere in New York City on Monday, July 21 at Jazz at Lincoln Center, along with a massive array of talent including stars Adam Sandler, Julie Bowen, Benny Safdie, Bad Bunny, and Kid Cudi, to name a few. Sandler reprises his role as the titular unsuccessful ice hockey player turned unlikely golf pro. Sandler’s “Grown Ups” co-star Kevin James revealed that a third installment may be on the horizon. “I think you can keep hope alive,” James told The Direct. “I can say that. I would keep a lot of hope alive. And I think it’s happening—something’s happening. I can say that.” “It would be fun, that would be fun,” Sandler told IndieWire on the “Happy Gilmore 2” carpet. “We’re always thinking of some shit and trying to get us all together. I’ve heard chatter.” As for if he is down for “Grown Ups 3,” Sandler says, “When it happens, I’ve got to let you know. I just don’t know what the fuck we’re doing right now, but we’re trying to figure out stuff.” We also had a chance to catch up with Safdie, who’s next project, “The Smashing Machine,” releases in theaters on October 3 from A24. The biopic follows UFC legend Mark Kerr, led by Dwayne Johnson. “It was one of the most incredible things to witness,” Safdie told IndieWire of Johnson’s unrecognizable transformation. “He was just so committed and amazing,” he continued. “To see him walking amongst, like, 400 people, and everybody being like, ‘When’s Dwayne going to get here?’ He’s just walking amongst everybody. Everything about him changed. It was really, really cool.” “You really understand the fears, the love, the sadness, the happiness,” Safdie previously said of just how great Johnson is. “If somebody’s open to doing that and talking about that stuff, then they’re going to be able to give a great performance. Because of how physically strong he is, I don’t know if a lot of people give him that opportunity.” “Happy Gilmore 2” is directed by Kyle Newacheck (“Workaholics,” “What We Do in the Shadows”), who also previously helmed Sandler’s 2019 film “Murder Mystery.” Sandler cowrote “Happy Gilmore 2” with Tim Herlihy, who also cowrote the original. It premieres July 25 on Netflix. Check out the trailer here.",
