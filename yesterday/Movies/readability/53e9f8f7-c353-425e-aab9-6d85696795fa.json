This first premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival last year, and it just played at the 2025 Palm Springs Film Festival earlier this month. Actress / singer / dancer Liza Minnelli tells her own story in this fabulous salute to an iconic talent. This doc covers it all: her childhood in mother Judy Garland's shadow, her bonds with mentors Kay Thompson, Charles Aznavour, Bob Fosse, her up-and-down marriages, and the triumphs of Broadway and Cabaret. After the tragic death of her mother Judy Garland at the end of the 60s, she spent her next years seeking out extraordinary mentors: Fred Ebb, Charles Aznavour, Halston, and Bob Fosse. Her concert performances at Carnegie Hall in 1979 and 1987 and at Radio City Music Hall in 1991 and 1992 are recognized among her most successful. From 1988 to 1990, she toured with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. in Frank, Liza \u0026 Sammy: The Ultimate Event. This doc seems like a triumphant celebration of the […]",

Official trailer for Bruce David Klein's doc Liza: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story, on YouTube: This star-studded tribute brings into focus the dazzling, complex period of Liza Minnelli's life starting in the 1970s, just after the tragic death of her mother Judy Garland – as she confronts a range of personal and professional challenges on the way to becoming a bona fide legend. With insightful participation from a coterie of colleagues such as Michael Feinstein, Mia Farrow, Ben Vereen, Joel Grey and the late Chita Rivera, along with the revelatory participation by the star herself, the film illuminates the contradiction of Liza Minnelli: her privilege and struggle, strength and vulnerability, unreal expectations and towering talent – the friction of which fueled her stunning rise, resilience and her enduring place as one of the greatest, most original performers in the history of entertainment. Liza: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story is directed by producer / filmmaker Bruce David Klein, director of the films The Stranger, Meat Loaf: In Search of Paradise, and Icahn: The Restless Billionaire previously. This initially premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival last year. No official release date is set yet - stay tuned for updates. Look good?
