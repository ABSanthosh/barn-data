  "text": "Billboard Women in Music 2025 Universal closed out its CinemaCon presentation Wednesday with an emotional first look at Jon M. Chu’s Wicked: For Good, the second part of his Oscar-winning musical fantasy. Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo were onstage with Chu and producer Marc Platt. No musical performances ala Erivo and Grande’s at the Oscars, but the trailer shown to theater owners inside the room was epic enough. And they went nuts for it. Wicked: For Good will continue the story of Grande’s Glinda and Erivo’s Wicked Witch of the West, formerly known as Elphaba. It hits theaters domestically November 21. “Elphaba, I know you’re out there,” says Galinda in a voice-over. We see the pink witch emerging from her emerald castle. Elphaba drops on the balcony. “This is about the Wizard and I,” the green witch exclaims. We see Galinda putting the big tiara on. Prince Fiyero and his men are racing through the forest looking for Elphaba. There’s a shot of Elphaba’s sky-writing “OUR WIZARD LIES.” Says Galinda, “Elphaba, they’re coming for you. Think about what we can do together,” in a shot of the pink witch leaning her head on the green one’s shoulder from the first film. We see Galinda walking down the wedding aisle toward the Prince. Then there’s Jeff Goldblum’s wizard at his control boards; he later tells Dorothy, the Lion, Tin Man and Scarecrow, “Bring me the broom of the Wicked Witch of the West!!” Final shots are Elphaba reaching out for her hat which flies into her hand, and her broom into the other. “I’m off to see the wizard!” Jonathan Bailey will return as Fiyero, and Ethan Slater’s Boq will be back as well as Marissa Bode’s Nessarose, Michelle Yeoh’s Madame Morrible and Goldblum’s Wizard of Oz. Wicked: For Good has wrapped production, with Chu cutting both films side-by-side ahead of the release of Wicked: Part One. That first movie grossed over $747M globally after its November 2024 release and was nominated for 10 Oscars, winning two. Winnie Holzman, the book writer who adapted the stage musical from Gregory Maguire’s bestselling novel, is behind the script with co-writer Dana Fox. Broadway musical songwriter Stephen Schwartz executive produces alongside Jared LeBoff and David Nicksay. Producers include Platt and David Stone.",
