  "text": "James Gunn recently gave some updates about the status of The Authority and Swamp Thing DCU movies. What are the new DCU updates from James Gunn? Speaking to Josh Horowitz during a recent appearance on the Happy Sad Confused Podcast, Gunn gave a less-than-positive update on the status of The Authority. “It’s been rough for us,” Gunn said. “I moved…the writer moved on to another project in the DCU that I think he’s really killing right now.” Gunn wouldn’t reveal what the other project was, but did say it was another movie set in the DCU. The Authority was one of the original projects announced by Gunn when DC Studios was first revealed. However, the project has remained up in the air ever since, with recent reports suggesting that the film has been moved to the “back burner” of DC’s slate. As for Swamp Thing, Gunn actually provided a positive update about that. He was asked whether or not James Mangold — who was tapped to write and direct the project — had delivered a script as of yet. Gunn revealed he hadn’t, but that the pair just spoke. “We talked to James the other day,” said Gunn. “No, he hasn’t delivered a script. He’s been distracted with his billions of movies. But we’re talking about it again.” Originally reported by Anthony Nash at SuperHeroHype.",
