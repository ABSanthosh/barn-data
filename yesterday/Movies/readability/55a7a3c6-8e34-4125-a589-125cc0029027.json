  "text": "SNL Film has unveiled the cast and creative team behind soccer comedy “Olde Boys.” The film is written, directed and produced by Nick Wilkinson, and with producer Lisa G. Black onboard too, and Screenbound handling worldwide sales. The film begins principal photography this September in the U.K. and U.S. The film tells the story of Mike Giordano, a small-town lawyer and weekend striker, whose over-50s soccer team is falling apart—until he enters them into the World Masters tournament in England with the help of his spirited teenage daughter and coach, Frankie. The film stars Tuc Watkins (“Desperate Housewives,” “Uncoupled”) as Mike Giordano, the team’s self-appointed leader and lovable schemer. Guy Nardulli is Nico Tavakoli, the prankster playmaker with a taste for risk. Jay Huguley (“12 Years a Slave”) is Rob Mason, the gruff team captain hiding deep insecurities. Popular on Variety Ray Fearon (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Harry Potter”) is Travis Richards, the rock-star MVP (most valuable player), with demons to match his talent. Cailey Fleming (“The Walking Dead,” “IF”) is in talks to play Frankie Giordano, the film’s young heart and tactical genius. Shanley Caswell (“The Conjuring”) is also in talks, with August Diehl (“Inglourious Basterds”) attached in a pivotal role. The project is being positioned as a smart, feel-good crowd-pleaser with broad global appeal, inspired by fan-favorite titles like “Ted Lasso,” “The Full Monty” and “Fishermen’s Friends.” “ ‘Olde Boys’ is a story I’ve lived and loved — about friendship, reinvention, and the beauty of the game,” said Wilkinson. “This film celebrates that timeless feeling of still being young at heart, no matter what your knees tell you.” Wilkinson’s debut feature “Death on the Brandywine” will screen in the Cannes market on May 19. It is a political murder mystery satire starring Kate Burton, Tuc Watkins, Guy Nardulli and Satomi Hofmann. It is currently selling in the market. Wilkinson penned, directed and produced alongside Black. Black, known for titles such as “The BirdCatcher,” “Miles,” “HEVN” and “Almost Paris,” brings decades of experience to the project. She is also co-chair of the Producers Guild of America – capital region. “Olde Boys” is set to premiere in 2026 to coincide with the FIFA World Cup.",
