  "text": "We will update this article throughout the season, along with all our predictions, so make sure to keep checking IndieWire for the latest news from the 2025 Emmys race. The nomination round of voting takes place from June 12 to June 23, with the official Emmy nominations announced Tuesday, July 15. Afterwards, final voting commences on August 18 and ends the night of August 27. The 77th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards are set to take place on Sunday, September 14, and air live on CBS at 8:00 p.m. ET/ 5:00 p.m. PT. The State of the Race One of the big takeaways from the winter TV awards season is that “The Bear” has lost a bit of its luster after a polarizing third season. This has manifested in a bunch of wins for “Hacks” rather than the Emmys record-breaking FX series, but the one main category the Max series has no contender for is Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. With a third win this year, “The Bear” star Jeremy Allen White would put his name in the record books next to “Family Ties” star Michael J. Fox and “All In the Family” star Carroll O’Connor for most consecutive wins in the category. But don’t overlook the other big thing that happened this winter: “Only Murders in the Building” winning over SAG. With his Male Actor in a Comedy Series win, in addition to the Hulu show’s Best Ensemble in a Comedy Series win at the 2025 SAG Awards, this upcoming Emmys could finally see Martin Short get his due for the comedic murder mystery that’s in production on its fifth season already. Funny enough, though New York City is core to the identity of the show, the specific season of “Only Murders” that Short (and co-star Steve Martin) is up for is its Hollywood-set season. That happens to play into an overall trend developing this season in which, post-LA wildfires, there is a spotlight on the shows that shot in California. “The Studio” starring Seth Rogen is the shiniest new example, as it is a show about the industry, but Adam Brody in “Nobody Wants This” on Netflix, Nathan Lane in “Mid-Century Modern,” and even Jason Segel in “Shrinking,” who was nominated for Season 1, all star in shows that shot in the city, with plots that celebrate the greater Los Angeles area. Though this does play into some of the network shows as well. Remember, the Emmys are voted on by industry peers, so it does carry some weight that new series like “St. Denis Medical” on NBC and “Poppa’s House” on CBS, which star “In Living Color” alums David Alan Grier and Damon Wayans Jr., respectively, also shoot in Los Angeles, therefore providing jobs to the same community of voters attending FYC events. Current Contenders (In Alphabetical Order):Mohammed Amer, “Mo” (Netflix)Matt Berry, “What We Do in the Shadows” (FX)Patrick Brammall, “Colin From Accounts” (Paramount+)Adam Brody, “Nobody Wants This” (Netflix)Ted Danson, “A Man on the Inside” (Netflix)David Alan Grier, “St. Denis Medical” (NBC)Luke Kirby, “Étoile” (Prime Video)Nathan Lane, “Mid-Century Modern” (Hulu)Steve Martin, “Only Murders in the Building” (Hulu)Danny McBride, “The Righteous Gemstones” (HBO)Seth Rogen, “The Studio” (Apple TV+)Jason Segel, “Shrinking” (Apple TV+)Martin Short, “Only Murders in the Building” (Hulu)Damon Wayans Jr., “Poppa’s House” (CBS)Jeremy Allen White, “The Bear” (Hulu) More Comedy Category Predictions:Outstanding Comedy SeriesOutstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy SeriesOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy SeriesOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series To see IndieWire’s full set of predictions for the 77th Emmy Awards, click here.Last Year’s Winner: Jeremy Allen White, “The Bear”Still Eligible: Yes.Hot Streak: Although “The Bear” star Jeremy Allen White would not be breaking the category record for most wins with a threepeat this year, he would be tying the record for most consecutive Emmys for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series with “Family Ties” star Michael J.

With his Male Actor in a Comedy Series win, in addition to the Hulu show’s Best Ensemble in a Comedy Series win at the \u003ca href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/awards/results/2025-sag-awards-winners-list-1235097783/\"\u003e2025 SAG Awards\u003c/a\u003e, this upcoming Emmys could finally see Martin Short get his due for the comedic murder mystery that’s in production on its fifth season already. Funny enough, though New York City is core to the identity of the show, the specific season of “Only Murders” that Short (and co-star Steve Martin) is up for is its Hollywood-set season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat happens to play into an overall trend developing this season in which, post-\u003ca data-id=\"https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/los-angeles-wildfires-resources-places-to-donate-1235083778/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/los-angeles-wildfires-resources-places-to-donate-1235083778/\"\u003eLA wildfires\u003c/a\u003e, there is a spotlight on the shows that shot in California. “The Studio” starring Seth Rogen is the shiniest new example, as it is a show about the industry, but Adam Brody in “Nobody Wants This” on Netflix, Nathan Lane in “Mid-Century Modern,” and even Jason Segel in “Shrinking,” who was nominated for Season 1, all star in shows that shot in the city, with plots that celebrate the greater Los Angeles area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThough this does play into some of the network shows as well. Remember, the Emmys are voted on by industry peers, so it does carry some weight that new series like “St. Denis Medical” on NBC and “Poppa’s House” on CBS, which star “In Living Color” alums David Alan Grier and Damon Wayans Jr., respectively, also shoot in Los Angeles, therefore providing jobs to the same community of voters attending FYC events.\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent Contenders (In Alphabetical Order):\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eMohammed Amer, “Mo” (Netflix)\u003cbr/\u003eMatt Berry, “What We Do in the Shadows” (FX)\u003cbr/\u003ePatrick Brammall, “Colin From Accounts” (Paramount+)\u003cbr/\u003eAdam Brody, “Nobody Wants This” (Netflix)\u003cbr/\u003eTed Danson, “A Man on the Inside” (Netflix)\u003cbr/\u003eDavid Alan Grier, “St. Denis Medical” (NBC)\u003cbr/\u003eLuke Kirby, “Étoile” (Prime Video)\u003cbr/\u003eNathan Lane, “Mid-Century Modern” (Hulu)\u003cbr/\u003eSteve Martin, “Only Murders in the Building” (Hulu)\u003cbr/\u003eDanny McBride, “The Righteous Gemstones” (HBO)\u003cbr/\u003eSeth Rogen, “The Studio” (Apple TV+)\u003cbr/\u003eJason Segel, “Shrinking” (Apple TV+)\u003cbr/\u003eMartin Short, “Only Murders in the Building” (Hulu)\u003cbr/\u003eDamon Wayans Jr., “Poppa’s House” (CBS)\u003cbr/\u003eJeremy Allen White, “The Bear” (Hulu)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore Comedy Category Predictions:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/awards/predictions/2025-emmys-comedy-series-predictions-1235110583/\"\u003eOutstanding Comedy Series\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/a\u003eOutstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series\u003cbr/\u003eOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series\u003cbr/\u003eOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo see IndieWire’s full set of predictions for the 77th Emmy Awards, \u003ca href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/awards/predictions/2025-emmy-predictions-primetime-awards-1235103182/\"\u003eclick here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLast Year’s Winner:\u003c/strong\u003e Jeremy Allen White, “The Bear”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStill Eligible:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHot Streak:\u003c/strong\u003e Although “The Bear” star Jeremy Allen White would not be breaking the category record for most wins with a threepeat this year, he would be tying the record for most \u003cem\u003econsecutive\u003c/em\u003e Emmys for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series with “Family Ties” star Michael J.
