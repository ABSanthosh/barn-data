  "text": "Almost 10 years later, and Denis Villeneuve still regrets that the Academy did not honor Amy Adams‘ out of this world “Arrival” performance. Villeneuve told Variety that Adams should have been Oscar-nominated for her turn in his 2016 sci-fi film “Arrival.” According to Villeneuve, Adams’ dedication to green screen acting in the film about aliens landing on Earth was worthy of Academy recognition. “Arrival” received eight Oscar nominations, including Best Director for Villeneuve. “Amy had the whole weight of the movie on her shoulders,” Villeneuve said of Adams’ role. “It’s not easy to act in a film like that, against a green screen or a tennis ball. She made it look effortless, and it’s a shame the Academy didn’t recognize that.” Popular on IndieWire He added of Adams’ awards snub, “That was a big disappointment.” Adams has been nominated by the Academy Awards six times in total, most recently in 2019 for “Vice.” She is next starring in “Nightbitch,” which will be released in theaters December 6. Adams told IndieWire that awards recognition is not a factor when taking on projects, though. “It’s not something I think about when I approach a role or when I walk on a red carpet,” Adams said. “I’m always happy if the film connects in a way that increases exposure for the film.” She continued of her upcoming feature “Nightbitch,” “I think with this film, I would love to hear different people’s perspectives of their experience watching this film. So the more that we can get it out there to get more eyes on it, the happier I’ll be.” Similarly, Villeneuve told Variety that he creates films for the sake of cinema and not the Academy. “As a filmmaker, you’re a lonely wolf. When your work is appreciated by the community, it feels like you’re part of a family. That’s what truly matters to me,” Villeneuve said. “Making movies means being away from your family for months. Every time I finish a film, I sit down and ask myself if the flame is still there because I’ll never make a film without that fire inside me.” The auteur is rumored to be working on “Dune 3” after his Academy Award-winning “Dune” and its 2024 sequel, “Dune: Part Two.”",
