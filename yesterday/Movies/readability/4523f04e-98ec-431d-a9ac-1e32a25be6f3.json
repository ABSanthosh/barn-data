  "text": "Following former president Joe Biden‘s diagnosis of an “aggressive form” of prostate cancer, political figures like Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton and more are sharing their well wishes to the veteran politician. “Doug and I are saddened to learn of President Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis,” the former vice president shared on X. “We are keeping him, Dr. Biden, and their entire family in our hearts and prayers during this time. Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership. We are hopeful for a full and speedy recovery.” Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton added on the platform, “I’m thinking of the Bidens as they take on cancer, a disease they’ve done so much to try to spare other families from. Wishing you a speedy, full recovery.” Watch on Deadline Former U.S. Secretary of Transportation under Biden, Pete Buttigieg, wrote, “President Biden is a man of deep faith and extraordinary resilience. Chasten and I are keeping him, and the entire Biden family, in our prayers for strength and healing.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement on X: “Our hearts are with President Biden and his entire family right now. A man of dignity, strength, and compassion like his deserves to live a long and beautiful life. Sending strength, healing and prayers his way.” U.S. Representative Jasmine Crockett added, “My heart is with President Biden and his family. Lifting him up in prayer and wishing him a peaceful, successful healing journey.” House of Representatives Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement: “The House Democratic Caucus and our nation are praying for President Joe Biden and his family as he battles this challenging medical diagnosis. Over the years, the Biden family has confronted unimaginable adversity with grace and steadfast perseverance. We stand with President Biden as he confronts this moment with the same courage and resilience he has shown throughout his life. In Isaiah 40:31, the scripture tells us, ‘they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.’ President Joe Biden is a man of intellect, dignity, compassion, great accomplishment and faith. May the Lord bless and watch over him and his family at this time.” Bids for prayer also came from across the political aisle, including former Republican presidential primary candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. The former wrote: “Politics aside, let’s pray for the health of our nation’s former President. His case of metastatic prostate cancer appears to be still in the hormone-sensitive disease stage, which leaves open the possibility of effective treatment.” Meanwhile, the latter said, “I’m sorry to see this news. Cancer is truly awful. My Dad passed away in 2021 with cancer. Prays for Joe Biden and his family.” Announced today via an official statement from his personal office, Biden’s diagnosis came after physicians discovered a new prostate nodule after the former POTUS began experiencing increasing urinary symptoms. Characterized by a Gleason score of 9 with metastasis to the bone, the diagnosis is deemed high risk, as scores of 8-10 are considered highly aggressive and rapidly growing cancers. However, the statement read that Biden and his family are “reviewing treatment options with his physicians” and that the disease “appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management.”",
