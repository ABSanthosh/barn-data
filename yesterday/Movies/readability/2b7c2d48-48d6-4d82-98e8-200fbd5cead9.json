  "text": "Wondering when Episode 11 of Landman will be released or if the series has come to a close? Set in the world of the West Texas oil industry, this contemporary drama has captivated audiences with its gritty story of the pursuit of wealth. Fans want to know if there are plans for Episode 11 or if a second season is in the works. Here’s the latest on Landman’s future. Is there a Landman Episode 11 release date and time? Unfortunately, there is no Landman Episode 11 release date and time. Paramount+ recently concluded its Landman drama series, which premiered on Sunday, November 17, 2024, and quickly gained popularity among fans. Episode 10 closed with a bang, bringing the season to its conclusion. In the final episode, titled ‘The Crumbs of Hope,’ viewers saw a crucial conversation between Tommy and Cami. Together, they weighed the risks of gambling versus playing it safe, all while the cartel made its move. Will there be a Landman Part 2 with more episodes? As of now, there is no official confirmation regarding a Landman Part 2 or additional episodes. However, it is like likely audiences will see more of the series in the future. Created by Taylor Sheridan and Christian Wallace, this gripping American drama set in West Texas follows a struggling oil tycoon trying to lead his company to success during an oil boom. The series received positive reviews, with a 79% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an IMDb score of 8.3. As Season 1 of Landman concludes, fans are buzzing with excitement and speculation about the possibility of a second season. While the current storyline appears neatly tied up, viewers are eager for more intense drama from the Texas oil scene. Paramount+ has yet to make any official announcements, but the buzz surrounding the show has fans hopeful for a return. Demi Moore, the Golden Globe-winning actress, mentioned in a recent interview with Deadline that she is excited to head back to Texas and begin filming Season 2 soon. The cast includes Billy Bob Thornton, Ali Larter, Jacob Lofland, Paulina Chávez, James Jordan, Demi Moore, Jon Hamm, and more. Catch all episodes of Landman Season 1 now streaming on Paramount+.",
