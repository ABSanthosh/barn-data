Friday, July 11 Level 33 Entertainment Acquires Frida Kahlo Animated Feature, ‘Hola Frida’ Level 33 Entertainment has acquired the U.S. distribution rights for “Hola Frida,” a Spanish-language animated feature film about the childhood of artist Frida Kahlo. The film will hit theaters on Aug. 8. “Hola Frida” depicts the child Kahlo growing up in a small Mexican village in the early 1900s. When a polio diagnosis leaves her bedridden, she finds refuge in her imagination, thinking up images, shapes, and colors that will shape her world-renowned creativity. The film aims to inspire and entertain, but also educate, as the “Hola Frida” website includes impact resources for learning about the artists’ work, life, and legacy. On the acquisition, Level 33 President Andreas Olavarria states, “If families are looking for something a little different in theaters this summer, ‘Hola Frida’ provides a wonderful escape that will keep kids entertained and teach them a little something along the way.” “Hola Frida” is based on of the picture book, “Frida, c’est moi,” by Sophie Faucher and Cara Carmina. The film is directed by Karine Vézina and André Kadi. Thursday, July 10 Freestyle Digital Media Acquires ‘A Spartan Dream,’ Sets Limited Theatrical Release Freestyle Digital Media — the independent film arm of Byron Allen’s Entertainment Studios — has acquired the distribution rights to “A Spartan Dream” and will release it in select theaters for one week, starting Aug. 15. “A Spartan Dream” is a romantic-comedy adventure film riddled with fantasy and myth. Based on a true story, the film follows an ancient-Greece-obsessed American who travels to the land of his ancestors to sell his old family homestead. However, plans go awry when he falls in love with a beautiful Greek woman; he changes course to salvage the village and change history. The film stars Peter Bundic, Georgia Mesariti, Katerina Didaskalou, Renos Haralambidis and Nikos Tsergas, and is the feature directorial debut for M. Achilles. It gained attention after winning Best Feature Film at the 2025 Prague Actors and Filmmakers Film Festival. The movie’s theatrical run will take place in five cities between Aug. 15 and Aug. 22. It will simultaneously become available on VOD platforms, and the DVD will release in September. Supernatural Horror-Thriller ‘Klifhaus’ Wraps Production Principal photography for “Klifhaus,” a psychological horror-thriller starring Nick Stahl (“Carnivàle, In the Bedroom”), Ana Ularu (“Emerald City,” “Siberia”), and Rade Sherbedgia (“Snatch,” “The Old Man”) has officially wrapped production. The film is based on “House of Horrors,” a short story by Ben Bank, who also serves as an executive producer on the film. The screenplay was written by Almagor, who will direct the film, Michael HarPaz, and Marat Parkhomovsky. “Klifaus” is set in “a decaying Stalin-era estate deep in the Eastern European Forest, where the White family confronts buried trauma and supernatural unrest.”  Stahl will play William, a rising politician drawn into the shadows of his authoritarian lineage, while Ularu will play Katie, his psychologically unraveling wife. Sherbedgia will play Levan, the estate’s haunting caretaker. “”Klifhaus” began with a question that haunted me: what if the real horror isn’t the house, but the person you share it with?” says Almagor. “I set out to make a horror film where the true monster is emotional neglect, and the house becomes both a trap and a mirror. This is a slow-burn descent into madness, about a marriage eroded by silence, control, repression, and unmet need, where the supernatural is simply the echo of everything that’s gone unsaid.” The film is seeking global sales and distribution partners. Wednesday, July 9 Leonardo DiCaprio and Fisher Stevens’ ‘We Are Guardians’ Documentary Raises Over $1 Million For Amazon Rainforest Protection The “We Are Guardians” film impact campaign team has raised over $1 million in support of the Indigenous-led movement to protect the Amazon rainforest and its people. The majority of the impact campaign funds will be directed to the forest guardians featured in the film and Indigenous-led initiatives, including projects and training for Indigenous women. The money will also be used to build the infrastructure necessary to achieve the film’s long-term impact goals, support the film’s release, fund accessible community events, educational theatrical experiences and opportunities for viewers to engage in person with Indigenous movement leaders.  “The film’s impact campaign is an essential part of the project,” Edivan Guajajara, the film’s director, said. “It’s not just about showing the story, but mobilizing people, creating strategic partnerships, influencing policies, and inspiring everyone to join this fight. The world needs to understand that protecting Indigenous peoples is protecting the planet. Every viewer can become a guardian. That’s our mission.” Produced by Fisher Stevens with Leonardo DiCaprio as executive producer, “We Are Guardians” is an environmental documentary that follows the Indigenous forest protectors of the Amazon as they risk their lives to fend off illegal loggers and land invaders. In addition to raising money, the impact campaign has delivered drones, radios, firefighting equipment and cameras to forest guardians as well as building monitoring bases. Following its premiere in June, the theatrical release of “We Are Guardians” opens in New York on Friday and will continue its showings nationwide through September. International Cinematographers Guild Announce Emerging Honoree Recipients The International Cinematographers Guild (ICG, IATSE Local 600) has chosen eight honorees to receive the 2025 Emerging Cinematographer Awards (ECAs). Among honorees are Isaac Banks, “The Trophy King,” John B. Barrett, “Recall,” Daniel Cotroneo, “Yae: Blind Samurai Woman,” Eythan Maidhof, “Class Clown,” Mariscela Beatríz Méndez, “The Middle,” Josh Pickering, “Boundless | HomeAid,” Steven Jacob Russell, “Hammer” and Alexa Wolf, “To Fade Away.” The ECAs support the next generation of visual storytellers by spotlighting and honoring early-career and emerging Directors of Photography. “The Emerging Cinematographer Awards reflect the important values that ICG stands for — fostering talent, mentorship, and supporting a strong creative community,” says John Lindley, ASC, National President of the ICG. “These honorees represent the future of our craft, and we’re privileged to elevate their visions at this pivotal moment in their careers.” “By recognizing outstanding talent at the earliest stages of their careers, the ICG is proud to help open doors and create opportunities for emerging Directors of Photography to thrive in this dynamic industry,” says Steven Poster, ASC, Chair of the Guild’s ECA committee. Eduardo Fierro, SVC, 2013 ECA alumnus who now joins this year as the new Co-Chair of the ECA committee, adds, “It’s an honor to step into this role and help continue the tradition of uplifting fresh voices in cinematography. As an ECA alumnus, this has been a full circle experience for me. The ECAs celebrate both artistic excellence and the spirit of mentorship that defines our community.” The 27th annual awards gala and reception will be held at the Television Academy Saban Media Center Wolf Theatre, on Sept. 28. Vimeo Announces First Short Film Grant Winners Vimeo has announced the full list of their first Short Film Grant winners. The program, which was launched earlier this year in March, is set to provide aspiring filmmakers with industry access and the opportunity for distribution to Vimeo’s global audience. “For two decades, Vimeo has served and inspired millions of filmmakers and film enthusiasts around the world,” says Philip Moyer, the CEO of Vimeo. “We are incredibly proud to partner with industry leaders, Nikon and RED, on this new grant program to accelerate the future of storytelling and launch a new generation of filmmakers. Together we will provide filmmakers with resources, mentorship, and a trusted platform to create exceptional short films and connect with a global audience.” The 2025 winners were selected by a jury of industry professionals including David Lowery (“The Green Knight), Charlotte Wells (“Aftersun”), Sean Wang (“Didi”), Savanah Leaf (“Earth Mama”) and cinematographer Adam Bricker.

Rodriguez “La Selva,” directed by Sofia Camargo “I Remember the House Was Red,” directed by Carmen Pedrero “The Only Man to Ever Exist,” directed by Annie Ning “The Ineffable Hum,” directed by John C. Kelley Monday, July 7 “Sheepwell” Wraps Production As Michole Briana White, Alix Lapri and More Lead Cast Pathway Pictures and SheNYC Arts have wrapped production on the dark comedy feature film “Sheepwell,” starring Michole Briana White, Alix Lapri, Connor Paolo and producer Lauren Elizabeth Harris. Based on the Off Broadway play of the same title by Margaret Rose Caterisano, director Kim Caicedo adapted the story into a screenplay alongside Danielle DeMatteo. “Sheepwell” is described as a feminist thriller that reveals what happens when an overconfident traveler messes with the wrong woman. Denise Grayson also acted in the film. “Upon reading the script for the first time, I was immediately consumed by these women and the eerie, twisted Southern landscape that they’re trying to survive in,” Caicedo said. “This film is more than just a mystery and a thriller. It’s a real-life depiction of what women in our society have to fear and fight for every day.” DeMatteo, who is also the founder and artistic director of SheNYC Arts, added, “Sheepwell” is an incredibly special story that’s kept all of us up at night at SheNYC, ever since we first read the original play script. We had the privilege of bringing it to life on an off-Broadway stage back in 2023, and it’s going to be even more thrilling and shocking on screen.”",

It’s a real-life depiction of what women in our society have to fear and fight for every day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tDeMatteo, who is also the founder and artistic director of SheNYC Arts, added, “Sheepwell” is an incredibly special story that’s kept all of us up at night at SheNYC, ever since we first read the original play script. We had the privilege of bringing it to life on an off-Broadway stage back in 2023, and it’s going to be even more thrilling and shocking on screen.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
