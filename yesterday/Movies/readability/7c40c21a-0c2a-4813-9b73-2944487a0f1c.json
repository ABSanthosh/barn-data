The pop sensation and beauty mogul is known for her powerhouse vocals and iconic style, but fans often wonder what fragrances she swears by. So, what perfume does Grande wear most often? Here’s a look at the “7 Rings” singer’s top three scents, their notes, and what they reveal about her style. The celebrated singer, actor, and beauty entrepreneur considers fragrances an essential part of her style. Ariana Grande’s top three favorite perfumes are MOD Vanilla EDP (from her own line), Flowerbomb by Viktor \u0026 Rolf, and Neroli Portofino by Tom Ford. Each scent reflects a unique aspect of her personality and aesthetic. MOD Vanilla EDP MOD Vanilla, launched by Ariana Grande herself, is a creamy, musky vanilla scent with hints of orchid, making it an elegant and versatile choice. It is part of her personal perfume line, which debuted in 2015 with the release of “Ari.” Grande has shared that this fragrance is a staple in her collection, loved for its sophisticated yet approachable charm. Flowerbomb by Viktor \u0026 Rolf Ariana Grande also favors the timeless Flowerbomb, a floral explosion featuring notes of jasmine, freesia, and rose, anchored by patchouli and warm amber. This luxurious fragrance is a celebrity favorite, known for its blend of sensuality and femininity. Its rich floral composition embodies the “Position” hitmaker’s elegance and vibrant personality. Neroli Portofino by Tom Ford Finally, Ariana Grande appreciates Neroli Portofino, a unisex fragrance by Tom Ford. It features a citrusy, Mediterranean-inspired scent. The top notes include neroli, bergamot, and Sicilian lemon. These pair with a heart of orange blossom and lavender to create a crisp and fresh aroma. The fragrance complements the singer’s dynamic style. While Grande is also known to wear a few other fragrances, the ones mentioned above are her top favorites. Since 2015, she has also released over ten successful fragrances. Her first, Ari, is a fruity-floral gourmand scent. Other popular creations include Cloud, Thank U Next, and God Is A Woman. Each reflects Grande’s personal milestones and creative vision in the fragrance world.",
