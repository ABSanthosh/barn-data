  "text": "A new anthem from Karol G, Feid, J Balvin, Maluma, Blessd and Ryan Castro arrived Thursday under the name “+57″ — Colombia’s telephone code. All of the featured artists hail from Medellín, the capital of the Antioquia province in Colombia. Produced by Karol’s longtime and go-to producer, Ovy on the Drums, “+57” was co-written by all of the artists alongside Latin Grammy-winning songwriter Keityn, and newcomer DFZM. All of the featured vocalists get a turn spitting their verse over a sticky reggaeton beat. “Because in Medellín, I’m like Drake in Toronto,” sings Blessd. The single arrived alongside a music video that reveals the song was recorded in February earlier this year in Los Angeles. It features all of the artists partying and recording in the studio. Karol, Balvin and Feid are each nominated for awards at the 25th Annual Latin Grammy Awards, which will take place on Nov. 14 at the Kaseya Center in Miami. The former is nominated for a total of eight awards while the latter two have each earned four and one nomination, respectively. Karol took home the golden gramophone for album of the year at the Latin Grammys this past year for “Mañana Será Bonito.” Popular on Variety Balvin released his sixth studio album “Rayo” on Aug. 9, which featured a 15-song series of reggaeton, pop and EDM music. The “Prince of Reggaeton” will make his acting debut in the upcoming feature “Little Lorrain,” which is directed by Grammy nominee Andy Hines. The release of “+57” marks a major moment of representation for Colombia, which has a rich musical history of genres such as salsa, cumbia, vallenato, champeta and more. The country has produced stars such as Shakira, Carlos Vives, Sebastián Yatra, Fonseca, Juanes and Andrés Cepeda. Watch the video for “+57” below.",
