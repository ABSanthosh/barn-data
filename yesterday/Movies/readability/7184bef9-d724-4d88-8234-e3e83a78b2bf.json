  "text": "Chelsea Handler spoke with Kara Swisher at SXSW (via Daily Beast) and criticized Elon Musk‘s influence over Donald Trump by asking: “Did anyone vote for Elon Musk to be the president? I mean, can’t we come together — Republicans and Democrats — and say we don’t want that. Can’t we agree on that at least?” “I don’t know why we can’t somehow figure out a way to get together and at least have one goal in mind to not be, you know, a Russian asset,” she added. Shortly after winning last year’s presidential election over Kamala Harris, Trump assigned Musk a task to “dismantle” the U.S. bureaucracy by providing outside advice to the administration from a “Department of Government Efficiency.” The acronym DOGE was a nod to the Dogecoin cryptocurrency that has been associated with Musk. Musk claimed last October he could cut $2 trillion from the federal budget and added in a statement: “This will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in Government waste, which is a lot of people!” Popular on Variety When Swisher joked that Handler should just date Musk so she can try and limit his potential control over Trump (“I told her to take one for the team and date Elon Musk and bring him back”), the comedian quipped: “There’s a lot I would do for the country, but having sex with Elon Musk is not one of them. I can’t.” Switching her attention to vice president JD Vance, Handler said she would be his worst nightmare as a romantic partner because “those types of men that want to keep women at home and being mothers, and you know, not having a career, like that’s just so antiquated and it’s so slow and it’s so boring. “I think the political situation we’re in is a direct reflection of the fact that men are so scared of women,” she added. “Like why are you acting like this if you’re not?… Women are more powerful and more independent than we’ve ever been, and that isn’t going to change.”",
