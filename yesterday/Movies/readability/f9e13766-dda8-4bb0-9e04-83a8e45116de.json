  "description": "Let's go! Off to Sweden! üá∏üá™ ‚ùÑ Enjoy this mesmerizing short film / music video creation from Sweden titled Vriden. This 4-mintue long short film features footage of a bunch of people up in Sweden having fun snow drifting in the middle of winter, all set to an entrancing Swedish song from artist Sara Parkman. It may seem like this is just another YouTube of kids goofing off and doing dangerous things (and it kind of is), but watching this you may find yourself impressed by the filmmaking and the entire stunt. Along with the whole concept, it's beautiful the way the snow and craziness and music all come together to offer an entertaining journey into this fun night on the snowy roads of Sm√•land, Sweden. It's like Tokyo Drift, but Sweden Drift, a snowy version of street drifting. I'm glad they stuck that light rack on top of the car, because the way the lights bounce off the trees and snow is glorious. You might find yourself watching this video over and over... Thanks to Reddit \u0026 YouTube for the tip on this short film. Original intro direct from the YT page: \"Drift in to the Swedish frozen forests [‚Ä¶]",
