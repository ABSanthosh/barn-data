  "text": "Rejoice! After years of streaming rights issues between Angel Studios and Dallas Jenkins’ 5\u00262 Studios, “The Chosen” has been saved by Amazon MGM Studios. In a deal with Jenkins and his production entity, Amazon MGM has picked up the streaming rights to the first five seasons of “The Chosen,” as well as the upcoming Seasons 6 and 7, all of which will be made available on Prime Video. A new unscripted series from 5\u00262 called “The Chosen in the Wild with Bear Grylls” was also picked up by Prime Video as part of the deal. Additionally, the deal includes theatrical distribution for the feature-length episodes that will be part of the next two seasons. These will be the last entries in “The Chosen” series, and as such, will cover both the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Though “The Chosen” may be coming to a close, Amazon MGM is opening the door for Jenkins and 5\u00262 with an additional first-look deal that covers both series and film projects. This comes after Jenkins had been licensing the show to mainstream streamers Prime Video, Peacock, and Netflix, as well as releasing episodes via “The Chosen” app and in theaters through Fathom Events, through which the series has done especially well at the box office. An official synopsis for “The Chosen” reads, “Set against the backdrop of Roman oppression in first-century Israel, the series shares an authentic look at Jesus’ revolutionary life and teachings. Season Five of ‘The Chosen’ is back for Holy Week, the most pivotal week in human history. Tables are turned. Friends are betrayed. And powerful leaders plot the death of Jesus.” Jenkins announced this new partnership with Amazon MGM Studios through 5\u00262 Studios’ live stream on YouTube before launching into a conversation with the company’s Head of Television, Vernon Sanders, and development executive Traci Blackwell. “’The Chosen’ has had renowned success captivating audiences across generations, and we are looking forward to collaborating with Dallas and 5\u00262 Studios on a larger scale,” said Sanders. “As we look ahead, we see massive opportunities to develop additional faith-inspired content for our global Prime Video customers.”  Jenkins added, “For several years, the team at Amazon MGM Studios has proved over and over they’re passionate about this show and our fans. They’re going to make us better and get the show to more people, and I can’t wait to build this relationship.” Amazon also has a deal with one of Jenkins’ contemporaries, Jon Erwin and his company Wonder Project, which is starting with its Biblical epic “House of David” about the fight between David and Goliath. Jenkins previously told IndieWire about his desire to build a cinematic universe out of “The Chosen,” expanding the different stories they can tell in and around the Bible, including the Bear Grylls series and an animated series. “It needs to feel authentic. It needs to feel human,” Jenkins said. “Most Bible projects you’ve ever seen, including classics like ‘The Ten Commandments,’ they don’t feel like real human beings talking. They feel like statues or stained glass windows. So as long as these new voices really do adhere to that, I think you will see a connective tissue in all these projects.” Season 5 of “The Chosen” will be released theatrically on March 28, followed by a U.S. streaming premiere on Prime Video some time in June. Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Sub-Saharan Africa, UK, and Latin America will have access to the series further along in the year. Global distribution for “The Chosen” is handled by Lionsgate.",
