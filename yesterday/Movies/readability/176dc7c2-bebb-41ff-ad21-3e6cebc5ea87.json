  "description": "\"Fighting is not about a system... It is working in harmony with nature's laws – to express who you really are.\" Um, sure? I guess so? Odysseus Entertainment has revealed the official trailer for a movie called The Martial Artist, starring and directed by Pakistani-American actor Shaz Khan. Yet another exceptionally generic film about a MMA fighter and how hard it is to be successful in this sport. An MMA fighter destined for greatness must face his biggest rival yet: himself. Shaz Khan stars as Ibby \"The Prince\" Bakran, a fighter who is about to achieve greatness when he's offered a deal by a major promoter. As his star begins to fade, he points the finger at everyone but himself, becoming withdrawn and puling away from his family who never wanted him to fight. So he returns to Pakistan to \"find what he's lost.\" The cast also includes Sanam Saeed, Babar Peerzada, Thesa Loving, Gregory Sporleder, and Faran Tahir. This looks so cheesy and over-the-top, every line of dialogue and every shot is so cliche. Meh. I hope the fights are cool at least?

Here's the official trailer (+ posters) for Shaz Khan's film The Martial Artist, direct from YouTube: When MMA rising star Ibby \"The Prince\" Bakran (Shaz Khan) shines in a local fight, the world's largest promotion company offers him a major deal he can't refuse. Now that he's aligned with the sport's top developing athletes, Ibby has a clear path to becoming great. Consumed with the limelight and all it has to offer, Ibby burns the candle at both ends \u0026 soon his fighting takes its own hit. As his star begins to fade, he points the finger at everyone but himself, becoming withdrawn \u0026 pulling away from his family who never wanted him to fight. Desperate to reconnect, his mother reveals the reason for her fear and the long-held truth about his father's death. With nowhere else to turn, he travels to his homeland to find answers from his estranged grandfather. In the majestic mountains of Pakistan, Ibby works to find his what he’s lost; but first he must face his biggest opponent yet: himself. The Martial Artist is directed by the Pakistani actor / filmmaker Shaz Khan, directing his first feature film. The screenplay is by Michael Ross Albert and Shaz Khan. Produced by Will Lurié, Shiraz Khan, Faran Tahir, Faisal Rehman, and Shaz Khan. Odysseus Ent. will debut Khan's The Martial Artist in theaters starting early 2025.
