Director Onah chose not to give Red Hulk a voice to keep him more instinct-driven than verbal. Thunderbolt Ross's struggle with his new persona takes precedence over dialogue in his transformation. Red Hulk's silence highlights the internal conflict of Ross moving away from his Thunderbolt identity. There have been a variety of Hulk personas throughout the MCU, with Hulk and She-Hulk typically teetering between rage and normalcy. In Captain America: Brave New World, we also added Red Hulk to the mix, but the character remained a little less vocal than the two Hulks that came before him. During an interview with Collider, Captain America: Brave New World director Julius Onah explained the choice, noting, \"Whether or not Red Hulk should talk, that was something that came up quite a bit; My feeling was that he shouldn't, which is what is the case in the movie.\" He then adds, \"The transformation that Ross is dealing with and the struggle that Ross is dealing with emotionally in this film is trying to move away from what he's been known as, as 'Thunderbolt Ross.' The moment you give him language as a Hulk, then people can talk to each other, and you're moving away from pure id to a more rational being.\" Red Hulk/President Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford) in Marvel Studios' CAPTAIN AMERICA: BRAVE NEW WORLD.
