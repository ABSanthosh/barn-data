  "text": "Korean entertainment powerhouse CJ ENM has secured an unprecedented access prime-time slot for Korean dramas on Mexico’s Imagen Televisión. The strategic partnership will deliver a dedicated K-drama programming block that will air weekdays during primetime hours for a minimum eight-month commitment. This arrangement represents the first time a Korean drama slot has been established in Mexico’s competitive television landscape, with all featured content coming exclusively from CJ ENM’s premium catalog. Mexican viewers will gain access to a diverse slate of hit series including “Familiar Wife,” “Oh My Baby,” “Mr. Queen,” “Emergency Couple,” “Another Miss Oh,” and “Yumi’s Cells.” “The Hallyu wave in Mexico, in its full cultural scope, is a phenomenon we simply couldn’t overlook,” said Erick Pulido, content and programming director at Imagen Televisión. “We identified a strong demand for K-dramas that had yet to be consistently addressed – until now. And there’s no better platform than Imagen to lead the way.” Popular on Variety Pulido emphasized his network’s strategic positioning: “Our brand identity is rooted in being the viewer’s passport to the world, offering top-tier dramas from Turkey and Brazil. Now, thanks to our partnership with CJ ENM, audiences can also enjoy high-quality K-dramas, airing Monday through Friday.” Sebastian Kim, VP of the international content business department at CJ ENM, added: “We are thrilled to see Korean dramas gaining dedicated access prime-time exposure on a major Mexican broadcaster like Imagen Televisión. It not only strengthens CJ ENM’s presence in Mexico but also underscores our commitment to delivering well-made content to global audiences.” This latest venture further solidifies CJ ENM’s growing international footprint while creating new pathways for cultural exchange through narrative storytelling. The partnership appears strategically timed to capitalize on the surging popularity of Korean entertainment properties across Latin American markets.",
