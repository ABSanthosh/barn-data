  "text": "That’s a wrap on Homelander, Hughie and Billy Butcher as The Boys completes production on its fifth and final season. Series creator Eric Kripke bid farewell to the set for the Prime Video series adaptation of the comic book, sharing a tribute Tuesday on Instagram with a photo of himself in The Seven’s conference room at Vought Tower, looking up at the mural of Homelander (Antony Starr) on the ceiling. “This is the last time I’ll ever be on this set. It’ll be torn down soon,” he captioned the post. “It’s bittersweet, but my primary feeling is gratitude. We have the best cast, the best crew, the most fun story to write, and something that is impossible to predict: the right timing. You wait your whole career to have maybe two of those things, if you’re lucky. We got all of them.” Watch on Deadline Kripke continued, “To #TheBoys family: thank you, I love you all. To the fans: thanks for watching, can’t wait for you to see the grand finale. That’s a wrap.” Back in 2020, Kripke noted that his “rough idea” for The Boys was “roughly five seasons,” while acknowledging that his previous show Supernatural ran for 15 seasons. “But I also know better than to say how many seasons a show is gonna have,” he said at the time. The final season of The Boys, premiering in 2026, comes after Season 4 topped the Nielsen streaming scores for the first time, setting multiple records for Prime Video. Prime also has the animated spin-off The Boys Presents: Diabolical and the college-based Gen V. Meanwhile, Aya Cash and Jensen Ackles are reprising their roles as Stormfront and Soldier Boy in the upcoming ‘50s-set prequel spin-off Vought Rising, and Diego Luna and Gael García Bernal are executive producing The Boys: Mexico, from Blue Beetle writer Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer.",
