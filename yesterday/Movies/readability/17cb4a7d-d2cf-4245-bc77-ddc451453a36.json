Hilariously dumb. But that's what love makes you do. Here's the main official trailer (+ poster) for M. Achilles' film A Spartan Dream, direct from YouTube: A Spartan Dream is the story of Brad (Peter Bundic), a Greek American history buff who works hard at his father's failing New Jersey diner. Magical realism weaves its way through a romantic-adventure story (c. 1987) as Brad is sent to his ancestral village in Greece to evict relatives from a family home. Cracking under pressure, he escapes into fantasy, purposefully (and absurdly) recruiting the villagers to join him on a mission to reignite the Peloponnesian War with Athens. All to win the heart of a young Greek woman (Georgia Mesariti) who lives in the home. Set against the backdrop of the Greek government's concurrent quest to see the Parthenon Marbles returned from England, A Spartan Dream is an odyssey through one young man's exceptional imagination. A Spartan Dream is directed by newcomer filmmaker M. Achilles, making his feature directorial debut with this film. It's co-written and co-produced by Leonidas G. Demas, George Demas and Michael A. Nickles. And also produced by Lilette Botassi and Dimitris Hatzivogiatzis. This initially premiered at a few regional film festivals in 2024. Freestyle Digital Media will debut A Spartan Dream in select US theaters + on VOD starting August 15th, 2025 coming soon. Anyone want to watch?
