  "text": "Pedro Pascal is teasing The Fantastic Four: First Steps, in which he plays the role of Reed Richards, Mister Fantastic. Although the Marvel superhero has elastic abilities, it’s his intellect that Pascal is focused on in playing the character. “With Reed, his body may stretch, but this is a brain character,” the actor said in an interview with ComicBook. “I guess I’ll just give it completely away. I thought of the brilliance of an octopus. Not in any literal physical translated way, but I put it into my subconscious. Yeah. That’s the biggest character secret reveal that I’ve given to you.” Pascal also compared the differences in physical demands between his Fantastic Four character and Din Djarin in The Mandalorian. Watch on Deadline “You know, with Din Djarin, there’s so much physical authorship that is a collective effort, with my work, Brendan Wayne’s work, Latif Crowder’s work, other bodies that have stepped into the armor, but primarily, those two guys and myself,” he said. “With Reed, that, for me, was a brand new kind of experience to author something that is very, very familiar to the world, has previous authorship, a very specific understanding of the pages of the comics, and different evolutions and stuff like that. And then something that is so independent in its identity as far as our version is concerned. To me, you know, his body may stretch, but this is a brain character, and it’s really his mind that was the most important to me.” The Fantastic Four: First Steps opens in theaters on July 25 and it also stars Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Ralph Ineson, Julia Garner, Paul Walter Hauser, John Malkovich, Natasha Lyonne, Sarah Niles, and more.",
