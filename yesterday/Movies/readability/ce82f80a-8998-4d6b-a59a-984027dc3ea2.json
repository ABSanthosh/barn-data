  "text": "The Gotham Awards, the traditional kickoff to the annual movie awards season, is underway Monday at Cipriani Wall Street in New York. Organized by the Gotham Film \u0026 Media Institute, this year’s Gothams see Sean Baker’s Cannes Palme d’Or winner Anora come in leading the field with four nominations including for Best Feature, Best Director, Outstanding Lead Performance for Mikey Madison and Outstanding Supporting Performance for Yura Borisov. The Neon film is joined in the marquee Best Feature category by A24’s Babygirl and A Different Man, and Amazon MGM Studios’ Nickel Boys and Challengers. Last year, A24’s Past Lives won in the category on its way to an Oscar Best Picture nom. Watch on Deadline Already this evening, the Best Documentary Feature went to Antipode Films’ No Other Land, the vérité-style feature made by a Palestinian-Israeli collective of four directors over the course of five years. It provides a harrowing account of the destruction experienced by Masafer Yatta, a group of Palestinian villages in the southern West Bank, during the Israel-Hamas war. Meanwhile, Sideshow and Janus’ All We Imagine as Light, the narrative feature debut of Payal Kapadia, was named Best International Film, while Azazel Jacobs’ script for Netflix’s His Three Daughters was named Best Screenplay. Other categories to watch tonight include the gender-neutral Outstanding Lead Performance race, which in addition to Madison features buzzy names like Pamela Anderson, Demi Moore, Adrien Brody, Colman Domingo and Saoirse Ronan. A total of 10 competitive categories are being presented, along with a series of tributes that include honorees The Piano Lesson (Ensemble Tribute), Dune: Part Two‘s Denis Villeneuve (Director Tribute), Franklin Leonard and the Black List (Anniversary Tribute), Maria star Angelina Jolie (Performer Tribute), A Complete Unknown‘s Timothée Chalamet and James Mangold (Visionary Tribute), Challengers star Zendaya (Spotlight Tribute) and A24’s Sing Sing (Social Justice Tribute). Follow along below as we update the winners as they are announced.
