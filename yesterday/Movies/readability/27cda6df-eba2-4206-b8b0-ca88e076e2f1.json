Puzzle #675 went live at midnight, challenging players with clues about burlesque outfits, roaring sounds, and vowel-swapped dances. With perfect streaks at stake, many users sought out hints to solve the trickier groupings before time ran out. Here’s what we know about today’s Connections puzzle. Connections hint for April 16 The NYT Connections puzzle for April 16, 2025 (#675) includes four themed categories, arranged by difficulty from easiest (yellow) to hardest (purple). The yellow category features burlesque costume elements. The green category includes terms that describe surface damage. The blue category highlights things that produce a roaring sound. The purple category lists altered Latin dance names with one vowel changed. Category hints for April 16, 2025: Yellow: Burlesque wear Green: Mess up the surface Blue: They roar Purple: Latin dances with one vowel swapped Each category groups four related words. These hints guide players without directly revealing the final groupings. What are the Connections answers for today, April 16? The completed puzzle for April 16, 2025, is as follows: Yellow Category – Burlesque Wear: Boa, Corset, Garter, StockingsGreen Category – Mess Up The Surface Of: Scar, Score, Scrape, ScratchBlue Category – They Roar: Crowd, Engine, Katy Perry, LionPurple Category – Latin Dances With a Vowel Changed: Mamba, Meringue, Simba, Tangy Each group follows a clear thematic connection. The yellow category consists of items typically associated with burlesque performance attire. The green group contains verbs that refer to minor or visible surface damage. The blue group highlights subjects that produce loud roaring sounds, such as Katy Perry, who sang “Roar.” The purple group presents near-homophones of Latin dances with a single vowel altered—“Simba” mimics “Samba,” and “Tangy” mimics “Tango.” These are the correct answers for puzzle #675 in the New York Times Connections game for April 16, 2025.",
