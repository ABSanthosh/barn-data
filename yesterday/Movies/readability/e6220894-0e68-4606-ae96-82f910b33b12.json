  "text": "Jake Lloyd, who rose to fame as young Anakin Skywalker in 1999’s Star Wars: Episode 1 — The Phantom Menace, is opening up about his mental health struggles and the schizophrenia diagnosis that contributed to his leaving Hollywood shortly after the film’s release. In a new interview with Star Wars: Timelines co-author Clayton Sandell, Jake Lloyd said he was feeling “pretty good” after completing an 18-month stay at an inpatient mental health facility in Southern California. He is currently residing at a new rehabilitation center, where he’s still receiving treatment but is a free agent regarding leaving and coming back. “[I feel] pretty good, considering these 20 years of time that have come to an end,” he said. “I can now accept taking on continued treatment, and therapy, and my meds. Everyone’s been very supportive.” Watch on Deadline As Jake Lloyd’s mother, Lisa Lloyd, shared earlier last year, part of the issue was overcoming anosognosia, a neurological condition that causes a patient to be unconsciously in denial about their symptoms. “I don’t have the time for feeling volatile,” Jake Lloyd said of taking medication. “It is very much a cushion.” The former actor said “good things” have come from his time in treatment and that hitting “rock bottom” was necessary in order to “honestly take part in treatment, honestly take your meds, and honestly live with your diagnosis.” At just 8 years old, Jake Lloyd became a recognizable face after having appeared in George Lucas’ first prequel film. Lisa Lloyd previously said the backlash to her son’s acting was not among the reasons he quit the industry, as she shielded him from online vitriol, attributing it to personal and family issues. She also added at the time that the negative response did not lead to the diagnosis, which is genetic. While Jake Lloyd has since stopped appearing at conventions, he said the franchise — and its loving fans — still holds a special place in his heart. “The experience I’ve had with the fans is immediately therapeutic. Right now, it’s still therapeutic. It’s helpful for people and healthy. It isn’t something I’d shy away from.” He added, “I really do appreciate the time that’s been taken on us. I’m very appreciative.” As for any Star Wars reunions, Jake Lloyd said he is looking forward to viewing the films on the quintessential galactic holiday: “I’m holding out for May the Fourth with my mom,” he explained. Before The Phantom Menace, Jake Lloyd was in films like Jingle All the Way alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and Apollo 11. On TV, Jake appeared in episodes of ER and The Pretender. His last film credit was in 2001’s Madison.",
