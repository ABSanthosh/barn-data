Here's the two early teasers for Lucasfilm's next Star Wars: Visions - Volume 3 series, from YouTube: Star Wars: Visions will be a series of animated short films celebrating Star Wars through the lens of the world's best anime creators. In Visions Volume 3, the animated anthology returns to where it all began with nine shorts from nine different anime studios, including returning contributors Kamikaze Douga, Kinema Citrus Co., Production I.G., and Trigger. The next installment in this animation series will also introduce five new anime studios to the world of Star Wars: ANIMA (co-production with Kamikaze Douga), David Production, Polygon Pictures, Project Studio Q, and WIT Studio — to further demonstrate the diversity and creativity of Japanese animation. Disney will debut Star Wars: Visions - Volume 3 streaming on Disney+ worldwide starting on October 29th, 2025 coming this fall. The segment made by Production I.G., directed by Shin'ya Ôhira, is titled \"Black\". And there is another new Star Wars: Visions series spin-off called The Ninth Jedi coming later this year.
