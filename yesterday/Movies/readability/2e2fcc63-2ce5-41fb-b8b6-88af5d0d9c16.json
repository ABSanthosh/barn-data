  "text": "As the stars of Another Simple Favor dodge questions about their co-star’s ordeal, director Paul Feig is coming to Blake Lively‘s defense. The 4x Emmy nominee recently expressed his support for the actress as “an amazing collaborator” amid her ongoing legal feud with It Ends with Us co-star and director Justin Baldoni. “When I read people’s misconceptions about how movies are made, it’s just frustrating for me,” he told Esquire. “Every star I’ve worked with works this way. The idea that a star just shows up and you go ‘Here’s the script’ – please point me to one movie star who works that way. Watch on Deadline “So when the gang on the internet get [up in arms] about something, it’s just like, guys, you don’t know what you’re talking about. I love working with Blake – she’s just the best.” Feig added, “Outrage is the most boring emotion humans have these days. When it’s towards something meaningful, that’s great. But people get outraged at everything. It’s like, this is what you’re angry about? There’s other things to be outraged about – please, go and help make the world a better place.” Lively, who recently opened up about going through “the highest of highs and the lowest of lows in my life” over the past year, previously filed a lawsuit against Baldoni, alleging he launched a retaliatory smear campaign against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns. Baldoni followed Lively’s December 2024 lawsuit with a countersuit alleging defamation and other contractual claims against the actress and other defendants, including her husband Ryan Reynolds, for $400 million. Since then, the two have been engaged in a back-and-forth of accusations and dueling lawsuits. A trial date is set for March 9, 2026.",
