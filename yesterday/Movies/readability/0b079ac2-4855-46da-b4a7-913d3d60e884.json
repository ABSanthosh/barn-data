  "text": "Dexter has returned to San Diego Comic Con as everyone’s favorite fictional series killer has been resurrected. Michael C. Hall has returned to Ballroom 20, following his appearance last year when he surprised attendees at the Dexter: Original Sin, the prequel series starring Patrick Gibson. Today, Hall is back in the hot seat as the star of Dexter: Resurrection, reuniting him with new and returning members of the cast, including: David Zayas (Detective Angel Batista), James Remar (Harry Morgan), Jack Alcott (Harrison Morgan), David Dastmalchian (The Gemini Killer), and Krysten Ritter (Lady Vengeance). At the head of the table is showrunner and executive producer Clyde Phillips. Dexter: Resurrection takes place weeks after Dexter Morgan takes a bullet to the chest from his own son, as he awakens from a coma to find Harrison gone without a trace. Realizing the weight of what he put his son through, Dexter sets out for New York City, determined to find him and make things right. But closure won’t come easily. When Miami Metro’s Angel Batista arrives with questions, Dexter realizes his past is catching up to him fast. As father and son navigate their darkness in the city that never sleeps, they soon find themselves deeper than they ever imagined—and that the only way out is together. Watch on Deadline (L-R) Jack Alcott, Michael C. Hall and James Remar at the ‘Dexter: Resurrection’ press line on Friday Gilbert Flores The panel was kicked off by moderator Jaime Chung, who starred in Dexter: New Blood, the limited continuation series that picks up years after the original Dexter ended. “We have an ensemble of core actors and an amazing team of writers, led by the man to my right [Phillips], who mine the fertile soil of this world and capitalize on its increasing mythology. This season was an absolute blast to encounter this character, with a second chance at life, and find out what that looked like for him. That was a blast. I’m just grateful. I can’t believe I’m back here,” shared Hall. The fourth episode of this first season of Dexter: Resurrection introduced Peter Dinklage’s character Leon Prater at a dinner party only for serial killers.",
