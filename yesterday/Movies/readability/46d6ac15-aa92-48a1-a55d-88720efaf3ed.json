  "description": "\"Let us bear humble witness.\" Kinematics has debuted a trailer for a weird little indie film called Hippo, a kooky creation from filmmaker Mark H. Rapaport as his feature debut. It premiered at last year's Fantasia Film Festival and it also played at the Calgary Underground Film Festival earlier this year. Hippo, a peculiar adolescent, and his Hungarian step-sister Buttercup struggle to come of age in late 90s America, under the roof of a mother who has been institutionalized at least once.

Rapaport's film Hippo, direct from YouTube: Examines the coming-of-age of two step-siblings: Hippo, a video-game addicted teenager and Buttercup, a Hungarian Catholic immigrant with a love of classical music \u0026 Jesus.

Like the Ancient Greek Aphrodite, Buttercup's love is unrequited by a brother who prefers to indulge the art of war and chaos. The result is a hormone-fueled, tragicomic waking nightmare that must be seen to be believed. Hippo is directed by indie filmmaker Mark H. Rapaport, making his featrue directorial debut after a few shorts; he also founded the company Kinematics. The script is by Mark H. Rapaport \u0026 Kimball Farley. Produced by Anthony Argento, Siyu Lin, and Mark H. Rapaport. The film premiered at the 2023 Fantasia Film Festival last year. Rapaport's Hippo film will debut in select US theaters starting on November 12th, 2024 this fall. Is anyone curious? Find more posts: Indies, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
