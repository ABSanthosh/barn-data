Sounds good. Official trailer for Ebs Burnough's doc Kerouac's Road: The Beat of a Nation, direct from YouTube: The documentary Kerouac's Road: The Beat of a Nation explores how the legacy of Jack Kerouac's iconic novel On the Road (published in 1957) reflects in today's America. Interweaving stories of modern-day \"on-the-roaders\" who share connections to Kerouac's life, alongside those influenced by him or knew and loved him. Featured participants include Josh Brolin, W. Kamau Bell, Natalie Merchant, Matt Dillon, Jay McInerney, Joyce Johnson. On the Road remains as relevant today as it was in the 1950s, but both the book and Kerouac himself have never been explored in this way before. While based on the American road, On the Road inspired people globally to get out of where they are and engage in the world around them. Kerouac's Road: The Beat of a Nation is directed by American doc producer / filmmaker Ebs Burnough, director of the other doc film The Capote Tapes (2019) previously. It's produced by Eliza Hindmarch, John Battsek, and Ebs Burnough. This just premiered at the 2025 Tribeca Film Festival last month. Freestyle will debut Kerouac's Road doc film in select US theaters starting August 1st, 2025 coming soon. Who's down? Find more posts in: Documentaries, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
