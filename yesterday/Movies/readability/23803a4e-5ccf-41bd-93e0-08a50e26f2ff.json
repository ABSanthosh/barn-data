  "text": "Billboard Women in Music 2025 We haven’t heard much about Zach Cregger’s follow-up to “Barbarian” until now. Cregger was on hand at CinemaCon to tease “Weapons,” which New Line Cinema chief Richard Brenner described as “batshit insane.” The studio is clearly high on “Weapons,” having moved it up from a planned release in January 2026 to now opening August 8, 2025. We can see why. Cregger declined to give any spoilers, but the first look (which he added will likely never make its way to the public) did go deeper on some specifics than has been public in the past. The teaser showed Julia Garner as a teacher whose entire classroom of kids goes missing — but only her classroom. A child narrating the trailer describes how every kid at “2:17 in the morning woke up, went down the stairs, walked out the door, and never came back.” Josh Brolin appears as a furious parent in a town meeting asking why just her classroom, “only her children,” went missing. Those kids aren’t totally missing though, as we see a moment where all the children are sitting in Garner’s classroom in the dark. The rest is a whole lot of creepiness of some seemingly murderous children, some bloodshed, and more. Cregger in describing it said the material the CinemaCon audience saw “is just the tip of the iceberg,” and described it as “a movie that unravels and reinvents itself.” It’s previously been rumored to be in the vein of an interconnected film like “Magnolia” but with a horror twist. Cregger’s debut feature “Barbarian” was a surprise hit with $45 million worldwide, quickly making him one of the hotter new directors in the market and earning him a juicy deal with the studio. He also appeared during Sony’s presentation on Monday to tease his new take on “Resident Evil,” in which he described his love of the original video game franchise and the dread those games created for players. “Weapons” opens in theaters August 8 via New Line Cinema.",
