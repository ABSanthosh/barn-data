  "text": "Disney has finally announced The Dog Stars release date for 20th Century Studios’ newest post-apocalyptic sci-fi movie, which hails from director Ridley Scott. It will be based on Peter Heller’s bestselling 2012 novel of the same name. When is The Dog Stars release date? The Dog Stars movie has now been scheduled to debut in theaters on March 27, 2026. The ensemble cast will be led by Euphoria star Jacob Elordi, who has been tapped to portray the leading role of a civilian pilot named Hig. He is joined by Margaret Qualley (Substance), Josh Brolin (Dune), Guy Pearce (The Brutalist), and Benedict Wong (Doctor Strange). The movie is directed by Scott from a screenplay written by Mark L. Smith and Christopher Wilkinson. It is executive produced by Heller, Lily Brooks-Dalton, and Brandon Scott Smith, with Scott, Mark L. Smith, Michael Pruss, and Cliff Roberts serving as producers. It is a production by 20th Century Studios and Scott Free. Disney+ Has the Best Bundle in the Business Sign-up today for access to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ The original novel’s synopsis reads, “Hig’s wife is gone, his friends are dead, and he lives in the hangar of a small abandoned airport with his dog, Jasper, and a mercurial, gun-toting misanthrope named Bangley. But when a random transmission beams through the radio of his 1956 Cessna, the voice ignites a hope deep inside him that a better life exists outside their tightly controlled perimeter. Risking everything, he flies past his point of no return and follows its static-broken trail, only to find something that is both better and worse than anything he could ever hope for.”",
