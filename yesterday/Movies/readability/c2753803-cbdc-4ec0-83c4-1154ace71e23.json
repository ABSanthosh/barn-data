  "description": "\"Everything comes from you. And everything is you. The one \u0026 only not to forget - you are one.\" It's time! Happy Holidays movie geeks! It's time for a look back at the year in movies. Our good friend the \"Sleepy Skunk\" has released his annual end-of-the-year recap video - the 2024 Movie Trailer Mashup - editing together footage from every major movie trailer released throughout 2024 to make you smile and laugh and cry and feel good about how amazing movies are. Louis, who makes this mashup every year, puts so much focus into making sure this mashup plays perfectly. I'm happy to see him include clips from little films like Hundreds of Beavers, Widow Clicquot, Memoir of a Snail, Omni Loop, The Brutalist, Didi, and many more. Still no one can ever make a better mashup than Sleepy Skunk - still the greatest. Click play below \u0026 enjoy. This 2024 retrospective comes direct from SleepySkunk's YouTube page. For the full list of films (with time-stamps) featured in the video mashup, head right to this Tumblr page. As usual with these year-end video retrospectives, there's probably a few scenes you might not recognize or some you do and want [â€¦]",

As usual with these year-end video retrospectives, there's probably a few scenes you might not recognize or some you do and want to rewatch, which is why these are so much fun to examine closely every time.

As always, these video recaps make this year look like one of the best years ever in movie history - so many remarkable films. My top end-of-the-year recommendations to catch up with now: Sing Sing, Conclave, Furiosa, A Complete Unknown, Santosh, Black Dog, The Outrun, Nickel Boys, The Last Showgirl, + Nosferatu.
