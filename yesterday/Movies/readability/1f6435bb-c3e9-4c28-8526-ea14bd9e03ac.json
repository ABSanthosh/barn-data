  "text": "It’s time for one last game. Ahead of the third and final season of “Squid Game,” Netflix has released a teaser with little revealed, but much to discuss. “Squid Game 2” premiered in December, closing out Netflix’s 2024 and holiday programming with a bang. The highly-anticipated seven episodes debuted to 68 million views in their first week, ending with a mighty cliffhanger that makes Season 3 feel more like Season 2, Part 2. Three years after the events of “Squid Game” Season 1, Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) is hell-bent on finding the island and dismantling the games, using his prize money only in service of this quest. When members of his search team found the elusive Recruiter (Gong Yoo), Gi-hun ended up face-to-disembodied-voice with the Front Man and demands to go back into the game. By Season 2, Episode 3, he was back in his signature green-and-white tracksuit with the number 456 emblazoned across the chest — and 455 brand-new players who have no idea what’s in store for them. Popular on IndieWire The season introduced a handful of new characters, including ex-army operative Dae-ho (Kang Ha-neul), Hyun-ju (Park Sung-hoon) a trans woman trying to fund her surgery, mother-son duo Yong-sik (Yang Dong-geun) and Geum-ja (Kang Ae-sim), the pregnant Jun-hee (Jo Yu-ri), and the games’ guard No-eul (Park Gyu-young) — along with many more who didn’t survive up to the finale. In the Season 2 finale, Gi-hun convinced his fellow players to pose as the dead and overpower the guards who come to take their bodies. In the ensuing rebellion, he and a group of allies had a shootout with the guards, until Young-il turned back into Front Man (Lee Byung-hun) and executed Gi-hun’s best friend Jung-bae (Lee Seo-Hwan) right before his eyes. The Season 3 teaser ostensibly picks up right after this, with Gi-hun returned to the players’ dormitory in a coffin (this is weird enough, however, that it could be a dream). From there, it picks up with an expected mix of footage — the remaining players, glimpses of new games, of the VIPs, of the Front Man out of his mask, and of Jun-ho (Wi Ha-joon) who was last seen searching for the island with a fisherman who secretly works against him. As if all of that isn’t enough, the last sound in the teaser is of a crying baby, which can only mean one thing: Jun-hee is going into labor. Squid Game 3 starts streaming Friday, June 27 on Netflix. Watch the teaser below.",
