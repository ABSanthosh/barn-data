  "text": "Many are curious to know how Hailey Bieber reacted to Justin Bieber‘s position in Billboard’s recently released Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century list. She took to social media to express her thoughts on the publication’s ranking. However, she didn’t seem happy with the rank that Bieber was placed on and voiced her disappointment. Here’s what she said: How did Hailey Bieber react to Billboard’s list? Hailey Bieber expressed frustration after learning Justin Bieber’s position on Billboard’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century list. On November 21, the Rhode founder took to Instagram to share her disappointment with the publication, which placed her husband in the 8th spot on the list. Considering the ranking unfair, she expressed her anger in the comment section, writing, “Billboard is a f—— joke as per usual!” (via Ok! News). Her comment has since drawn mixed reactions. While many fans supported Hailey for defending her husband, others criticized her, arguing that Justin didn’t deserve a higher spot. Billboard has yet to respond to her remarks. The first top 10 on Billboard’s list included artists like Rihanna, Kanye West, Drake, Adele, Ariana Grande, Lady Gaga, and Britney Spears. The publication has yet to reveal the top two spots in the ranking. The model and the Baby singer, married since 2018, recently welcomed their first child, Jack Blues Bieber. A source told PEOPLE, that the couple was “overjoyed” at Jack’s arrival. Justin Bieber faces challenges despite the joy of welcoming their first child. He is under scrutiny for past ties to Sean “Diddy” Combs, who was recently arrested on serious charges. Rumors and resurfaced videos have taken an emotional toll on Justin, now 30. Hailey Bieber, his unwavering support system, encourages him to seek therapy. She credits therapy with transforming her own life. While Justin focuses on fatherhood, the couple works through these difficulties together.",
