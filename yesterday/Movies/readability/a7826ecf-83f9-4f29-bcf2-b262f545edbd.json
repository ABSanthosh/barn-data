  "text": "A new report suggests that Robert Eggers’ Werwulf cast has found two stars, who are very familiar to working with Eggers. Who has joined the Werwulf cast? According to a new report from Nexus Point News, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Lily-Rose Depp will reunite with Eggers in the upcoming movie about werewolves. Taylor-Johnson and Depp just recently worked with Eggers on his last film, 2024’s Nosferatu. Currently, it’s unclear exactly what role either will have, or if their casting is fully official. The rest of Werful’s cast is also unknown as of now, but Eggers did mention during the Nosferatu press tour that he had asked Willem Dafoe to be in two of his next movies. Werwulf will begin filming this September in Elstree, England. This means casting for the film is likely already underway, and we might know more information sooner rather than later. According to a Q\u0026A Eggers took part in at the Lincoln Center, the director himself said that his upcoming Werwulf will be the “darkest thing” he’s ever written. The movie is currently slated to release on December 25, 2026. Details for the project are mostly unknown as of now, but the project will be set in 13th-century England, and much like Eggers’ other projects, will feature dialogue and settings accurate to the period. Original rumors suggested the film would be in black and white, according to THR, but that won’t be the case. Prior to the announcement of Werwulf, rumors suggested that Eggers had been tapped to direct a new Labyrinth movie. Eggers himself has also spoken about wanting to make a medieval movie known right now as The Knight, as well as one day hoping to make a Western film. He’s also been rumored to be working on a miniseries about Grigori Rasputin, the Russian mystic and faith healer. (Source: Nexus Point News)",
