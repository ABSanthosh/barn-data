In the July 18 installment, Sasha and her baby Daisy exit Port Charles safely with the help of Steve Burton’s Jason Morgan, as she moves back in with her parents Holly Sutton (Emma Samms) and Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers) in Paris, France. Before Jason docks back in the U.S., he reminds Sasha that she will “always have a home to come back to,” leaving the door open for potential reprisals of the character in the future. “There was a good time in the storyline for Sofia to leave to pursue other opportunities in film and TV,” a representative for the soap told TVInsider yesterday. “But she is open for a return in the future.” Watch on Deadline Meanwhile, executive producer Frank Valentini added: “I love Sofia, she is a great actress and a dear friend. We will miss her, but we wish her the best in all of her future endeavors.” The actress told the outlet in a Q\u0026A published yesterday that the last day of filming “was emotional for sure. Cleaning out my room and knowing that I wouldn’t see all my friends there like usual every other day felt sad. But everyone was so supportive and excited for me.” She added of the “bittersweet” farewell: “I’ve had such a great time, but I’m also excited for a new chapter and to continue my acting journey in new projects.” Noting that she is “definitely not opposed to coming back to the soap world,” Mattsson teased that she has “some exciting new projects in the works, so I hope to see everyone through another screen soon!” Outside of the over 500 installments of GH she’s been in, Mattsson has also appeared in episodes of NCIS and Two and a Half Men.",
