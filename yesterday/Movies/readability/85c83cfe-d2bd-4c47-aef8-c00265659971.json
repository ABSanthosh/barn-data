  "description": "\"There's a unique function that happens in the dysfunction.\" Abramorama has revealed an official trailer for a rad new rock band documentary film called Born Innocent: The Redd Kross Story, from director Andrew Reich. It first premiered last year and won the Jury Award for Best Documentary at the 2023 Sound Unseen Film Festival. From inventing Beach Punk to influencing the Grunge and Hair Metal movements, Redd Kross have maintained the highest level of musical integrity, originality and quality for over forty years. Born Innocent makes the case for Redd Kross as the seminal West Coast band of the last half century. Their influence reaches across the genres of punk, college rock, grunge, metal \u0026 indie rock. Long a \"secret handshake\" favorite of true music fans, it’s time for the world to discover the joyful and irresistible music of The McDonald Brothers. Featuring Jeff McDonald, Steve McDonald, Kim Gordon, Thurston Moore, Mark Arm, Lou Barlow, Keith Morris, Donita Sparks, Jennifer Finch, Buzz Osborne, Dale Crover. Worth a watch.

Official trailer (+ poster) for Andrew Reich's doc Born Innocent: The Redd Kross Story, on YouTube: Born Innocent makes the case for Redd Kross as the seminal US West Coast band of the last half century. Passionate praise for the band started by 'freak brothers' Jeff \u0026 Steve McDonald – one of the most unique and influential American rock bands of the past four decades. A colourful and chirpy clusterf*ck of garage punk, glam, power pop, metal, candour, bullheadedness and wild adventures. A genre unto itself, and unto which, members of Sonic Youth, L7, Black Flag, Melvins, \u0026 Sebadoh profess undying love. Born Innocent: The Redd Kross Story is directed by producer / filmmaker Andrew Reich, directing his first feature film after writing \u0026 producing many other TV docs \u0026 projects previously. Produced by Julian Cautherley and Andrew Reich. This premiered at the 2023 Sound Unseen Film Festival and also played at the 2024 Calgary Underground Film Festival this year. Abramorama opens Born Innocent: The Redd Kross Story in select US theaters (LA at first) starting December 5th, 2024 this fall. For info head to the official site. Who's down?
