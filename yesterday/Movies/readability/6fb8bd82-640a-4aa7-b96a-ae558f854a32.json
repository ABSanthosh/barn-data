  "text": "Few films in recent memory have felt like more of a box-office triumph than “Five Nights at Freddy’s.” Emma Tammi’s adaptation of Scott Cawthorn’s beloved Gen Z video game about the creepy animatronic mascots of a fictional pizzeria who come alive at night was a massive success, grossing nearly $300 million on a $20 million budget in 2023. Its success was a vindication of the idea that younger audiences will show up to theaters when movie studios meet them halfway and adapt current IP rather than retreading legacy characters. (“A Minecraft Movie” drove home that point even further.) And, of course, the film was a reminder of Blumhouse‘s infallible cultural muscle. From “M3GAN” to “The Black Phone,” Blumhouse has consistently turned low-budget horror projects into runaway successes. And then, “M3GAN 2.0.” This summer’s highly anticipated sequel received poor reviews compared to its beloved camp-horror predecessor and grossed less than $40 million. The original “M3GAN,” by comparison, grossed over $180 million with a January release date. “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” is the opportunity for the company to regain momentum and all eyes were on Blumhouse when the company descended upon Hall H on Day 1 of San Diego Comic-Con. The “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” panel offered fans their best look yet at the film, which sees Tammi returning to the director’s chair Addressing fans at Comic-Con (via Variety), Tammi said that the sequel plans to double down on what the franchise does best: its whimsically creepy animatronic characters. She noted that “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” has nearly three times as many animatronics as its predecessor, and they were once again produced in collaboration with the Jim Henson Company. “We we really wanted to make the electronics feel and move as practically as possibly, versus the CG route, which is also incredible, but it just didn’t feel right for the nostalgia that Freddy’s invokes,” Tammi said. “We met with the Henson team, and they totally got that. They obviously have been doing that for decades, masterfully. On top of that, they really recognized that Freddy’s had this huge fan base, and that the designs from the game were really important.” A Universal release, “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” opens in theaters on Friday, July 5.
