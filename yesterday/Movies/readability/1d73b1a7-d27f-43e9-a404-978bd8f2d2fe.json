  "text": "The Mandalorian \u0026 Grogu cast continues to grow, with Jeremy Allen White now reportedly having signed on to star in the highly anticipated Star Wars movie. According to a report from Jeff Sneider of The InSneider, White will star in the movie in the role of Rotta the Hutt, the son of Jabba the Hutt. Sneider describes the character as “a rather adorable young character,” though it’s unclear just how old he’ll be by the time fans meet him in the movie. Alongside White, The Mandalorian \u0026 Grogu will also see the return of Pedro Pascal, who plays the role of Din Djarin/The Mandalorian in the Disney+ series as well. Sigourney Weaver is also set to star in the film in an as-of-yet undefined role. White is best known for his roles in the hit television series’ Shameless and The Bear, the latter of which has seen him earn two Golden Globe Awards and two Primetime Emmy Awards. He also most recently starred in A24’s wrestling drama The Iron Claw, and will play the role of Bruce Springsteen in the upcoming biopic Deliver Me from Nowhere. What is The Mandalorian \u0026 Grogu about? The Mandalorian \u0026 Grogu will continue the story from the hit Disney+ series on the big screen. Plot details are currently being kept under wraps for the first Star Wars movie starring Pedro Pascal, who plays The Mandalorian. Jon Favreau will be producing the movie in addition to directing, while Kathleen Kennedy and Dave Filoni will also be producing the film, which will likely feature Sigourney Weaver. Disney+ Has the Best Bundle in the Business Sign-up today for access to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ “The journeys of the Mandalorian through the Star Wars galaxy continue. Once a lone bounty hunter, Din Djarin has reunited with Grogu,” says the synopsis for Season 3 of the series. “Meanwhile, the New Republic struggles to lead the galaxy away from its dark history. The Mandalorian will cross paths with old allies and make new enemies as he and Grogu continue their journey together.” The show hails from executive producers Dave Filoni, Kathleen Kennedy, Colin Wilson, Karen Gilchrist, and Carrie Beck. Favreau served as showrunner and one of the third season’s directors. Seasons 1-3 are now available for streaming on Disney+, where it has become one of the streaming service’s most popular series and helped kick off a resurgence of Star Wars television shows.
