  "description": "\"If I command my heart to stop, it would stop.\" Neue Visionen Filmverleih in Germany has revealed the first look trailer for the highly anticipated German film titled Sound of Falling in English (or In die Sonne schauen in German), made by German filmmaker Mascha Schilinski. The film will be premiering tomorrow at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival in the Main Competition, a major debut for this little German film. It was supposed to premiere at Berlinale, but Cannes snatched it instead giving it a much more grand premiere. This epic story is set across four different times spanning decades. Four girls: Alma, Erika, Angelika, and Lenka, each spend their youth on the same farm in northern Germany. As the home evolves over a century, echoes of the past linger in its walls. Though separated by time, their lives begin to mirror each other. The film is \"a grand tour into the subtlest ramifications of the emotional worlds of these four women... A film that drills deep into our perception and stages the sensation where it is most fleeting: in the quickly fading feeling of time.\" Starring Hanna Heckt as Alma, Lena Urzendowsky as Angelika, Laeni Geiseler as Lenka, Susanne […]",

It looks gorgeously shot and very stylish - will definitely be watching. Keep an eye out for reviews \u0026 more festival updates soon. Here's the first German trailer (+ posters) for Mascha Schilinski's film Sound of Falling, from YouTube: A secluded four-sided farmhouse in the Altmark, Northern Germany. For over a century, the walls have breathed the lives of the people who live here, their tastes, their being in time. Sound of Falling tells the story of four women from different eras – Alma (1910s), Erika (1940s), Angelika (1980s), Nelly (2020s) – whose lives are eerily interwoven. Each of them experienced their childhood or youth on this farm, but as they wander through their own present, traces of the past reveal themselves. Unspoken fears, repressed traumas, buried secrets. Alma discovers she was named after her deceased sister and believes she must follow the very same fate. Erika loses herself in a dangerous fascination with her injured uncle. Angelika balances between a longing for death and a lust for life, trapped in a fragile family system. Finally, Nelly, who grows up in apparent security, is haunted by intense dreams and the unconscious burden of the past. When a tragic event is repeated on the farm, the boundaries between past and present will begin to blur... Sound of Falling, originally known as In die Sonne schauen in German (which translates to Looking Into the Sun), is directed by German filmmaker Mascha Schilinski, making her second feature film after directing Dark Blue Girl (2017) previously, and episodes of the \"Cologne P.D.\" series most recently. The screenplay is written by Mascha Schilinski and Louise Peter. It's produced by Lucas Schmidt and Maren Schmitt. This is premiering at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival playing in the prestigious Main Competition section. Neue Visionen Filmverleih will debut Schilinski's Sound of Falling in German cinemas starting September 11th, 2025 this fall. No US release date has been set yet - stay tuned for more updates.
