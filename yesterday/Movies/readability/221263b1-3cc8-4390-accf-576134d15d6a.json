  "text": "The Ice Age 6 release date has officially been set, with Disney setting a holiday time period for the next entry in the animated franchise to come out. When is the Ice Age 6 release date? According to Disney in a recent shift of release dates, the Ice Age 6 release date is set for December 28, 2026. The date puts the film out just a few days after Christmas, a big time slot for any movie. While not too much is known about the upcoming sixth entry in the series, Ice Age 6 will feature the return of long-time franchise stars Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, and Queen Latifah, as they reprise their respective roles as Manny the woolly mammoth, Sid the ground sloth, Diego the saber-tooth tiger, and Ellie the woolly mammoth. In addition, Shaun of the Dead’s Simon Pegg has also signed on to reprise his role as Buck the one-eyed weasel, who was first introduced in 2016’s Collision Course. He later reprised the character in a Disney+ movie titled The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild. At the moment, the creative team — including the director and writer — has yet to be revealed. Ice Age was produced by Blue Sky Studios, a division of 20th Century Fox. The voice cast also included Josh Peck, Seann William Scott, Keke Palmer, Wanda Sykes, Nick Offerman, Jennifer Lopez, Peter Dinklage, and Josh Gad. Disney+ Has the Best Bundle in the Business Sign-up today for access to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ Five Ice Age movies were released in theaters between 2002 and 2016, with a combined worldwide gross of $3.2 billion. In 2021, Blue Sky Studios was shuttered, with Disney taking over exclusive rights to the series.",
