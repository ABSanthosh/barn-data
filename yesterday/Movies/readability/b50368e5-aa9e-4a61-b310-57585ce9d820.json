  "text": "We will update this article throughout the season, along with all our predictions, so make sure to keep checking IndieWire for the latest news from the 2025 Emmys race. The nomination round of voting takes place from June 12 to June 23, with the official Emmy nominations announced Tuesday, July 15. Afterwards, final voting commences on August 18 and ends the night of August 27. The 77th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards are set to take place on Sunday, September 14, and air live on CBS at 8:00 p.m. ET/ 5:00 p.m. PT. The State of the Race The Outstanding Animated Program category serves as a great example of what the platonic ideal of Emmys voting is. It does not shy away from acknowledging when stalwart favorites remain good, but those who vote for the category have also been quick to recognize the different animation projects that drive the medium forward. For example, the most recent win for “The Simpsons” is sandwiched between the first two shows from a streaming service to ever win a category, “Arcane: League of Legends” and “Blue Eye Samurai” (both Netflix series,) and other innovative programs that have been of interest, like “X-Men ’97” and the canceled-too-soon “Scavengers Reign” still got nominations. Though the latter show was not purchased by any other network after coming to an end on Max, and catching a second wind when licensed by Netflix, much of the team behind it has found a bit of redemption with their new show “Common Side Effects” on Adult Swim, which has gotten nothing but good reviews. While the late night network has not gotten onto voters’ radars in other categories, Adult Swim has won this category several times in the past decade with shows like “Rick and Morty” and “Genndy Tartakovsky’s Primal,” so when it is offering a buzzy new contender, Television Academy members usually take notice. That sentiment could also lead to the Emmys nominating an anime series for the first time ever. Adult Swim has another contender called “Lazarus,” from the creator of “Cowboy Bebop,” which features some music from acclaimed jazz artist Kamasi Washington, and action sequences conceived by “John Wick” helmer Chad Stahelski.  But the anime series that is getting an even bigger Emmys push is “Solo Leveling” from Sony-owned streaming service Crunchyroll. Adapted from a Korean webcomic, the action series has become the latest hit for the anime hub that has become the model for successful niche streaming services. The Emmys have recognized series heavily inspired by anime before, like “Samurai Jack” or last year’s winner “Blue Eye Samurai,” but to honor an official anime produced in Japan could be a gamechanger for the category. But breaking into the category as a new network is hard. Amazon Prime Video, for example, has hit a stride on the animation front with shows like “Invincible” and “Hazbin Hotel” being among its most popular series in general, yet the network has never received a nomination in this category. The resilience could finally pay off, with the breadth of options it has. “#1 Happy Family USA,” for example, is in the spirit of Emmy winner “South Park” in how it unabashedly tackles hot button issues in the most humorous way. And “The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy” was nominated at the Annie Awards in the same category as “Bob’s Burgers,” which has won the Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program several times. “Secret Level” also received multiple nominations from that awards base for individual episodes. All that said, it is best to circle back to “Arcane: League of Legends,” considering how its win for Season 1 made history, therefore making its second season one of the most highly anticipated contenders. It just might be the toughest competition out there, even amongst other former winners, given how it actually won several Annie Awards earlier this year. Current Contenders (In Alphabetical Order):“Arcane: League of Legends” (Netflix)“Batman: Caped Crusader” (Amazon Prime Video)“Big Mouth” (Netflix)“Bob’s Burgers” (Fox)“Common Side Effects” (Adult Swim)“Creature Commandos” (Max)“Devil May Cry” (Netflix)“Invincible” (Prime Video)“Lazarus” (Adult Swim)“#1 Happy Family USA” (Prime Video)“The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy” (Prime Video)“Secret Level” (Prime Video)“Solo Leveling” (Crunchyroll)“Star Trek: Lower Decks” (Paramount+)“The Simpsons” (Fox)“What If…?” (Disney+) More Category Predictions:Outstanding Talk SeriesOutstanding Scripted Variety SeriesOutstanding Documentary or Nonfiction SeriesOutstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special View IndieWire’s full set of predictions for the 77th Emmy Awards. Last Year’s Winner: “Blue Eye Samurai”Still Eligible: No.Hot Streak: While “Blue Eye Samurai” is not back in the race this season, a win for “Arcane: League of Legends” would start a streak on multiple levels. It would be a second win in a row for Netflix — the first time a streamer has done that. It would be a second win in a row for “Arcane: League of Legends,” which would be the first streaming series to ever win this category more than once. Finally, it would continue Netflix’s record as the streaming service with the most category wins overall.Notable Ineligible Series: “Scavengers Reign” (ended); “South Park” (Season 27 is not eligible); “Rick and Morty” (Season 8 is not eligible); “Blue Eye Samurai” (Season 2 is not eligible); “X-Men ’97” (Season 2 is not eligible).",

“The Simpsons” is sandwiched between the first two shows from a streaming service to ever win a category, “Arcane: League of Legends” and “Blue Eye Samurai” (both Netflix series,) and other innovative programs that have been of interest, like “\u003ca href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/craft-considerations/x-men-97-making-of-90s-easter-eggs-1235038356/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.indiewire.com/craft-considerations/x-men-97-making-of-90s-easter-eggs-1235038356/\"\u003eX-Men ’97\u003c/a\u003e” and the canceled-too-soon “\u003ca

data-id=\"https://www.indiewire.com/features/animation/scavengers-reign-creators-emmy-nominated-2d-animated-netflix-1235035312/\"\u003eScavengers Reign\u003c/a\u003e” still got nominations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThough the latter show was not purchased by any other network after coming to an end on Max, and catching a second wind when licensed by Netflix, much of the team behind it has found a bit of redemption with their new show “Common Side Effects” on Adult Swim, which has gotten nothing but good reviews. While the late night network has not gotten onto voters’ radars in other categories, Adult Swim has won this category several times in the past decade with shows like “Rick and Morty” and “Genndy Tartakovsky’s Primal,” so when it is offering a buzzy new contender, Television Academy members usually take notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat sentiment could also lead to the Emmys nominating an anime series for the first time ever. Adult Swim has another contender called “Lazarus,” from the creator of “Cowboy Bebop,” which features some music from acclaimed jazz artist Kamasi Washington, and action sequences conceived by “John Wick” helmer Chad Stahelski. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the anime series that is getting an even bigger Emmys push is “Solo Leveling” from Sony-owned streaming service Crunchyroll. Adapted from a Korean webcomic, the action series has become the latest hit for the anime hub that has become the model for successful niche streaming services. The Emmys have recognized series heavily inspired by anime before, like “Samurai Jack” or last year’s winner “Blue Eye Samurai,” but to honor an official anime produced in Japan could be a gamechanger for the category.\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut breaking into the category as a new network is hard. Amazon Prime Video, for example, has hit a stride on the animation front with shows like “Invincible” and “Hazbin Hotel” being among its most popular series in general, yet the network has never received a nomination in this category. The resilience could finally pay off, with the breadth of options it has. “\u003ca data-id=\"https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/number-1-happy-family-usa-ramy-youssef-pam-brady-interview-1235116000/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/number-1-happy-family-usa-ramy-youssef-pam-brady-interview-1235116000/\"\u003e#1 Happy Family USA\u003c/a\u003e,” for example, is in the spirit of Emmy winner “South Park” in how it unabashedly tackles hot button issues in the most humorous way. And “The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy” was nominated at the \u003ca data-id=\"https://www.indiewire.com/awards/results/annie-awards-2025-winners-list-1235092908/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/awards/results/annie-awards-2025-winners-list-1235092908/\"\u003eAnnie Awards\u003c/a\u003e in the same category as “Bob’s Burgers,” which has won the Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program several times. “Secret Level” also received multiple nominations from that awards base for individual episodes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll that said, it is best to circle back to “Arcane: League of Legends,” considering how its win for Season 1 made history, therefore making its second season one of the most highly anticipated contenders. It just might be the toughest competition out there, even amongst other former winners, given how it actually won several Annie Awards earlier this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent Contenders (In Alphabetical Order):\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e“Arcane: League of Legends” (Netflix)\u003cbr/\u003e“Batman: Caped Crusader” (Amazon Prime Video)\u003cbr/\u003e“Big Mouth” (Netflix)\u003cbr/\u003e“Bob’s Burgers” (Fox)\u003cbr/\u003e“Common Side Effects” (Adult Swim)\u003cbr/\u003e“Creature Commandos” (Max)\u003cbr/\u003e“Devil May Cry” (Netflix)\u003cbr/\u003e“Invincible” (Prime Video)\u003cbr/\u003e“Lazarus” (Adult Swim)\u003cbr/\u003e“#1 Happy Family USA” (Prime Video)\u003cbr/\u003e“The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy” (Prime Video)\u003cbr/\u003e“Secret Level” (Prime Video)\u003cbr/\u003e“Solo Leveling” (Crunchyroll)\u003cbr/\u003e“Star Trek: Lower Decks” (Paramount+)\u003cbr/\u003e“The Simpsons” (Fox)\u003cbr/\u003e“What If…?” (Disney+)\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore Category Predictions:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOutstanding Talk Series\u003cbr/\u003eOutstanding Scripted Variety Series\u003cbr/\u003eOutstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series\u003cbr/\u003eOutstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eView IndieWire’s full set of \u003ca href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/awards/predictions/2025-emmy-predictions-primetime-awards-1235103182/\"\u003epredictions for the 77th Emmy Awards\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLast Year’s Winner:\u003c/strong\u003e “Blue Eye Samurai”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStill Eligible:\u003c/strong\u003e No.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHot Streak:\u003c/strong\u003e While “Blue Eye Samurai” is not back in the race this season, a win for “Arcane: League of Legends” would start a streak on multiple levels.
