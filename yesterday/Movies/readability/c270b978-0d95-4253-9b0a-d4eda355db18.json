  "text": "The next James Bond chapter has begun. Denis Villeneuve, the visionary behind “Dune,” “Blade Runner 2049,” and “Arrival,” has been tapped to direct the next James Bond film for Amazon MGM Studios, the company announced on Wednesday. Villeneuve will also executive produce alongside Tanya Lapointe. Amy Pascal and David Heyman, as previously announced, are shepherding the franchise and producing for Amazon MGM after taking over from Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. A new 007 still has not been selected. “Some of my earliest movie-going memories are connected to 007. I grew up watching James Bond films with my father, ever since ‘Dr. No’ with Sean Connery. I’m a die-hard Bond fan,” Villeneuve said in a statement. “To me, he’s sacred territory. I intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come. This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor. Amy, David, and I are absolutely thrilled to bring him back to the screen. Thank you to Amazon MGM Studios for their trust.” Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, commented, “We are honored that Denis has agreed to direct James Bond’s next chapter. He is a cinematic master, whose filmography speaks for itself. From Blade Runner 2049 to Arrival to the Dune films, he has delivered compelling worlds, dynamic visuals, complex characters, and — most importantly — the immersive storytelling that global audiences yearn to experience in theaters. James Bond is in the hands of one of today’s greatest filmmakers and we cannot wait to get started on 007’s next adventure.” Pascal and Heyman said in a statement, “Denis Villeneuve has been in love with James Bond movies since he was a little boy. It was always his dream to make this movie, and now it’s ours, too. We are lucky to be in the hands of this extraordinary filmmaker.” The next big question for Villeneuve is when any new Bond film, which will be the 26th in the long-running spy franchise, would begin production and who will play 007. Villeneuve is expected to be working on a third “Dune” film, with reports that it could begin shooting as early as this summer and could be aiming for a December 2026 release date, but nothing has been formally announced around the third film. THR however recently reported that Robert Pattinson was being eyed for a role in the film as its villain. Villeneuve is a four-time Oscar nominee (and IndieWire Honors recipient!) and with the two “Dune” films has made a statement as one of the bigger directorial names at the box office in the biz. Last year’s “Dune: Part Two” was nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture, and won two. Villeneuve is represented by CAA, Carlos Goodman, and ID.",
