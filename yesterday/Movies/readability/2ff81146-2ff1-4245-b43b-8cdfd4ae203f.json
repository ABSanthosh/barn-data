Yes that is actually the premise for this documentary film directed by Tony Benna, but it's also about much more than just that important PSA, of course. Andre is an Idiot is the one film at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival with the most unique title out of all the films in the line-up this year. And I'm glad it has this title because, if anything, this film will be useful (perhaps even life-saving) in seriously encouraging people to book a colonoscopy to check for colon cancer. Andre is an Idiot is about a kooky, one-of-a-kind creative individual named André Ricciardi. He was afraid of getting a colonoscopy and shrugged it off for years – until a doctor finally examined him and diagnosed him with stage 4 colon cancer. Unfortunately this film documents his dying after this diagnosis – it's a tragic story about cancer taking another life – but we're lucky we get to spend so much time with Andre and this film lets his humor and wit shine as he honestly discusses his situation, his feelings, and his family. Andre is an Idiot marks the feature directorial debut of a filmmaker named Tony Benna (with his roots in stop-motion animation and other areas of filmmaking). The title is really a specific reference to Andre's self-deprecation and self-awareness, as well as his humor in handling this tragic situation. He admits \u0026 accepts that he made a mistake taking so long to go get the colonoscopy and unfortunately this cancer had already gotten really bad by the time it was discovered. He goes on chemotherapy and half of the film is spent with him going through chemo, not only talking about this harrowing medical experience, also using this time to reflect on his life and his choices. Andre is an Idiot is a colonoscopy PSA but it's also a biopic, looking back at Andre's life with the hopes of showing us that although it was cancer that took him down, he still lived a beautiful life that made a difference – and will continue to make a difference with this film. Most of the film is uplifting, laugh-out-loud funny, and charming – Andre's family is wonderful and his wife is so loving and he wants to show us that life is beautiful even if it took him this long to finally slow down and talk about it. The filmmaking is just as beautiful as any of the people in the film and that makes a big difference when it comes to telling this story. This may sound harsh, but it is true – using comedy to talk about cancer isn't the most unique or original concept. Sundance is an important festival that has often been a showcase for many films that deal with death and tragedy and illness, and specifically, addressing the sadness of cancer and illness through comedy. Grace is Gone is a famous Sundance film (from 2007 – it won a bunch of award and was the biggest sale of the fest that year) starring John Cusack about a father struggling to tell his kids their mother has died. Then there is 50/50 with Seth Rogen \u0026 Joseph Gordon-Levitt (which premiered at TIFF 2011) and Me and Earl and the Dying Girl with Thomas Mann \u0026 Olivia Cooke (which premiered at Sundance 2015) both are well-known \"cancer comedies\". Our Friend with Jason Segel (which premiered at TIFF 2019) is another one - one of the most recent cancer comedies that had mainstream exposure. This is all to say that Andre is an Idiot actually fits right in at Sundance, and presents itself as amusing, touching, wholesome film that might change the lives of a few people despite how sad Andre's cancer story actually is. Above all, the humor and kookiness and charisma that Andre Ricciardi exudes is the key component in the film working well as a unique work of art anyway. I'm glad there's another \"cancer comedy\" out there that is this good. Andre used to work in advertising as a creative exec, and at one point in the film he goes back to his former ad company in New York City and works on concepts for a colonoscopy awareness campaign. At this point he seems to have accepted his fate but (after a nice magic mushroom session with his best friend) realizes he needs to make the most of his tragedy to hopefully do more for other people besides himself, and maybe save some lives if he can. A colonoscopy can identify problems early which can be solved before they spread and the cancer hits stage 4, which is what Andre is dealing with and wishes no one else needs to deal with. I do hope this film has an impact and reaches audiences beyond just film festival regulars. Spending time with Andre and his lovely family is rewarding and humbling no matter what, and that makes this film worthwhile even if it's tough to sit with the sadness of it. He reminds us laughter really is the best medicine.
