  "text": "The mysterious Weezer movie that was announced last week has just gotten even more news, with Jeff Sneider of The InSneider reporting that Keanu Reeves will star in the project as a villain, along with who is behind it. What do we know about Weezer’s mystery movie? The surprising film was announced by the band themselves during their performance at last weekend’s Coachella music festival. In a brief moment in between songs, songwriter and guitarist Rivers Cuomo confirmed that the band had been hard at working making “the Weezer movie. News of the movie had been circulating for some time, with the band even asking an audience for help filming a large fight scene in October 2024, according to Rolling Stone. Now, more information is available. According to Sneider’s latest report, several high-profile actors will star in the film. Reeves will play the villain of the movie, but it will also include the likes of Ben Schwartz, Juliette Lewis, Eric Andre, and Johnny Knoxville, all of whom will appear as themselves in some fashion. As for the directors of the movie, Sneider mentions that the film comes from Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, the directors of Paranormal Activity 3 and 4, and is a “concert movie that doubles as a mockumentary.” According to Sneider, the mockumentary part of the movie will take place “in a heightened reality” that’s described as a mix of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and Weird: The Al Yankovic Story. No official word on when the movie is set to release has been made available as of yet. (Source: The InSneider)",
