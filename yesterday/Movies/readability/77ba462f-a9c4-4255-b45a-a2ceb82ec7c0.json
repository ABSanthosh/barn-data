  "description": "\"I will never stop it.\" Netflix has revealed a fantastic teaser trailer for an action thriller movie from Japan titled Bullet Train Explosion, arriving to watch pretty soon in April. This is a surprise remake / reboot of the 1975 Japanese action classic Bullet Train, which many action filmmakers have been influenced by. It's the brand new modern Japanese update like Shin Godzilla, and yep, it's even directed by the same guy who co-directed Shin Godzilla, and made the most recent Shin Ultraman. When panic erupts on a Tokyo-bound bullet train (known as Shinkansen) planted with a bomb that will explode if it slows below 100 km/h, the authorities race against time to save everyone. There's also an superb new poster showing Takaichi standing before the burning Hayabusa No. 60 train, capturing the extreme tension. Starring Tsuyoshi Kusanagi, with Kanata Hosoda, Non, Jun Kaname, Machiko Ono, Hana Toyoshima, and Daisuke Kuroda. This has some incredible footage, modernizing it in a captivating way - with so much attention from viewers and extremely fast bullet trains.

I gotta admit - as a train geek, I cannot wait to watch this. A perfect teaser. Here's the first teaser trailer for Shinji Higuchi's film Bullet Train Explosion, direct from YouTube: \"With special cooperation from the East Japan Railway Company, the production used real bullet trains and railway facilities to craft extremely realistic visuals, which were seamlessy enhanced with cutting-edge visual effects. Packed with non-stop suspense, this high-stakes thriller will keep audiences breathless from start to finish.\" \"Don't stop...\" A tense phone call came into the Shinkansen General Operation Control Center. The caller claims that a bomb has been planted on the Hayabusa No. 60 train bound for Tokyo, and that the bomb will explode as soon as the speed of the Shinkansen train drops below 100 km/h. The caller demands 100 billion yen in ransom money to disarm the bomb. The last-minute battle unfolds as the crew, passengers, and railroad workers strive to prevent the explosion within the limited time available. Will the running Hayabusa No. 60 be able to overcome this crisis? Bullet Train Explosion is directed by Japanese VFX artist / filmmaker Shinji Higuchi, director of Lorelei, The Floating Castle, Attack on Titan: Part 1 \u0026 2, and the recent live-action Shin Ultraman movie; also known for his Gamera VFX and tons of other projects. The screenplay is by Kazuhiro Nakagawa and Norichika Ôba. Inspired by the 1975 action classic Bullet Train. Produced by Kota Ishizuka; executive produced by Yoshihiro Satô. Netflix will debut Higuchi's Bullet Train Explosion movie streaming worldwide starting April 23rd, 2025 this spring. Who's excited to watch this?
