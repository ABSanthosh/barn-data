  "text": "(Updated, 4:57 pm with statement from Blake Lively‘s lawyers) In a move straight out of the Donald Trump playbook, Justin Baldoni and his publicists have sued the New York Times for millions because of the paper’s explosive story on his It Ends With Us co-star Blake Lively’s claims of sexual harassment and a smear campaign from the Jane the Virgin alum and his flacks. The 87-page libel complaint filed in LA Superior Court just hours before 2024 ends accuses the Grey Lady and its journalists of being in league with Lively with a lengthy article that “cherry-picked and altered communications stripped of necessary context and deliberately spliced to mislead.” The NYT did not respond to request for comment from Deadline on Baldoni and crew’s action. If they do, this post will be updated. Watch on Deadline Blake Lively’s side, on the other hand, certainly had something to say. “Nothing in this lawsuit changes anything about the claims advanced in Ms. Lively’s California Civil Rights Department Complaint, nor her federal complaint, filed earlier today,” attorneys for Lively told Deadline. “This lawsuit is based on the obviously false premise that Ms. Lively’s administrative complaint against Wayfarer and others was a ruse based on a choice ‘not to file a lawsuit against Baldoni, Wayfarer,’ and that ‘litigation was never her ultimate goal,”  Lively’s Manatt, Phelps \u0026 Phillips attorneys and Willkie Farr \u0026 Gallagher LLP firm add. “As demonstrated by the federal complaint filed by Ms. Lively earlier today, that frame of reference for the Wayfarer lawsuit is false.  While we will not litigate this matter in the press, we do encourage people to read Ms. Lively’s complaint in its entirety. We look forward to addressing each and every one of Wayfarer’s allegations in court.”  Full of text messages from Baldoni’s TAG PR team and others, Lively’s 80-page December 20 complaint to the California Civil Rights department accuses her IEWU co-star/director of sexually harassing her and subsequently enacting “a coordinated effort to destroy her reputation” via social media attacks and planted press pieces. A “shocking” countersuit was promised, and now we have it — though the shock value isn’t that high. Written in the usual hyperbolic tones that lawyer Bryan Freedman is well known for, Baldoni’s suit Tuesday tries to taint Livley’s own publicist Leslie Sloane for her past associations with Harvey Weinstein and clutches its pearls over Ryan Reynolds‘ stern words to Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios team during an all-hands January 4th meeting. The filing states that one producer present at the meeting over Lively’s requirements to resume filming said “in his 40-year career he had never seen anyone speak to someone like that in a meeting. Additionally, “the Sony representative mentioned that she would often think of that meeting and her one regret is that she didn’t stop Reynolds’ berating of Baldoni.” In fact, Baldoni’s filing denies that he and his team ever even saw the itemized requirements contained in Lively’s 10-claim December 20 complaint to the California Civil Rights department that the Gossip Girl vet says was presented at the January 4, 2024 sit-down. “In reality, many of these items were encountered for the first time in the CRD Complaint itself and include references to highly disturbing events that never occurred,” Baldoni’s libel and invasion of privacy suit. “The repeated use of the phrase ‘no more’ before each demand falsely suggests that these alleged incidents had previously taken place and needed to cease. This implication is not only misleading but entirely untrue.” What’s odd is that the Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel repped Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios responded just after that meeting with a note that while they say things differently than Lively, “Wayfarer, Sony and Production respectfully acknowledge that [Ms. Lively] has concerns regarding safety, professionalism and workplace culture.” While Lively has yet to actually file a suit of her own, though one is expected any day, Abel’s old Joneswork boss Stephanie Jones has already sued her ex-employee, Baldoni and TAG boss Nathan in a defamation action of her own. This came just days afters Abel pointed a finger at Jones for the internal communications in and around Baldoni getting to Lively’s lawyers and the NYT for its piece timed to teh actress’ confidential CCR filing. As Deadline has learned from others with knowledge of the situation and events, Nathan’s tactics and media associations aren’t held in the highest light in some circles. “What Melissa Nathan practices is not crisis PR,” the source told Deadline today. “It’s creating a crisis in other people’s lives for no other reason than her own personal profit and perverse prestige. Now we find that her sister abused her position at the New York Post to maliciously spread the slander. Looks like it runs in the family.” MORE",
