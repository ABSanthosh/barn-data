  "description": "\"The Imperium is a circus of fear and rumor. I'm surrounded by vipers!\" Whoa! This looks awesome. WB has revealed their full official trailer for the epic new sci-fi series Dune: Prophecy, a spin-off show that will stream on Max in November. It's the best trailer yet! Set 10,000 years before the birth of Paul Atreides, before the universe knew them as the Bene Gesserit... This is directly connected to Denis Villeneuve's two (so far) brilliant Dune movies but takes place in the distant past. Based on the book \"Sisterhood of Dune\" by Kevin J. Anderson and Brian Herbert (Frank's son). A better intro from the novel: \"It is eighty-three years after the last of the thinking machines were destroyed in the Battle of Corrin, after Faykan Butler took the name of Corrino and established himself as the first Emperor of a new Imperium. Great changes are brewing that will shape and twist all of humankind.\" So much going on in this trailer! Dune: Prophecy stars Emily Watson, Olivia Williams, Travis Fimmel, Mark Strong, Jade Anouka, Chris Mason, Jodhi May, Josh Heuston, Tabu, Sarah-Sofie Boussnina, and Shalom Brune-Franklin. Yes I am ALL in. Looks even better than I was hoping! [â€¦]",
