  "description": "\"Look what you unleashed...\" After plenty of waiting, nearly time for this superhero movie to hit theaters. Marvel has unveiled a final trailer for Thunderbolts*, their next MCU offering - an anti-hero team-up dark comedy thriller launching the summer movie season on on May 2nd. After finding themselves ensnared in a death trap, an unconventional team of anti-heroes must embark on a dangerous mission that will force them to confront the darkest corners of their pasts. The key ensemble cast includes David Harbour as Red Guardian, Hannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr / Ghost, Wyatt Russell as U.S. Agent, Sebastian Stan as Bucky, Lewis Pullman as Bob aka \"Sentry\", and Florence Pugh as Black Widow Yelena Belova, plus Olga Kurylenko as Taskmaster, Geraldine Viswanathan as Mel, and finally Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the handler Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. This trailer leans heavy on the emotion this time, playing this up as an actual high stakes, gripping, eerie thriller over all the comedy of the previous trailers. And this \"Void\" darkness-bringer villain guy looks super creepy, too. One last look before it arrives in theaters in early May. Here's the final official trailer (+ new poster) for Jake Schreier's Thunderbolts*, from Marvel's YouTube: [â€¦]",
