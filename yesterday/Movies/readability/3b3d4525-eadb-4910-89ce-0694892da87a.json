  "text": "Chad Duell, who has played Michael Corinthos on “General Hospital” for 14 years, is exiting the ABC soap opera. Duell announced the news in an Instagram post on Saturday, writing, “After many incredible years with ‘General Hospital,’ I’ve decided to step away from the show. This wasn’t an easy decision for me, but it feels like the right time in my life. I’m beyond grateful to Frank Valentini, the cast, crew, and everyone behind the scenes who have been like family to me throughout this amazing journey.” Duell ended his statement with a message to his fans. “Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your unwavering support and for letting Michael Corinthos be a part of your lives,” he wrote. “Your love and encouragement has meant the world to me. This isn’t a goodbye — it’s a see you later.” It is unclear at this time if the role will be recast. Variety has reached out to ABC for comment. Popular on Variety Duell took over the role of Michael, son A.J. Quartermaine (last played by Sean Kanan) and Carly Spencer (currently played by Laura Wright), from Drew Garrett in 2010. He won a Daytime Emmy in 2015 for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series. In 2022, “The Young and the Restless” alum Robert Adamson stepped in for Duell for eight episodes and, in October of this year, he temporarily took over the role of Michael again. Duell is the latest “General Hospital” veteran to exit the series. In August, Variety reported Kelly Monaco’s departure as Sam McCall after more than 20 years on the soap opera.",
