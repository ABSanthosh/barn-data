What did Krysten Ritter say about a Jessica Jones return? During a recent interview with ComicBook promoting her role in the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Ritter was told of comments made by Marvel Studios’ Head of Streaming, Television, and Animation Brad Winderbaum at D23 Brazil, where he said that he would like to see Jessica Jones return to the MCU if he had his pick. Ritter was quick to jump onto the idea, joking that Winderbaum was “the guy who makes the call,” and saying that she’d be up for it and ready should they ever call. “Brad Winderbaum said that? That’s really exciting to hear. Isn’t that the guy who makes the call?” Ritter said. “Come on, Brad! Let’s get it going. Let’s do it. I’ll be ready.” This isn’t the first time that Ritter has spoken about a return to the character. Two years ago, she also expressed hope that she would one day get to play the character again. “I have no idea,” said Ritter during an appearance on the podcast Inside of You with Michael Rosenbaum. “I hope so! I think that people love Jessica, I know because I live it. Honestly, I don’t know…Marvel is so secretive, I am just putting that out there that, of course, I would be there in a second. I would have my boots and jacket on, ready to rock.” Disney+ Has the Best Bundle in the Business Sign-up today for access to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ Jessica Jones originally premiered on Netflix in 2015, and was a part of Netflix’s batch of Marvel programming, which included Daredevil, Iron Fist, Luke Cage, and The Defenders. The cast of Daredevil is set to make its arrival back to the MCU next year, in the form of Daredevil: Born Again.",
