  "text": "Time is ticking and no one is getting any younger and Robert Pattinson is well aware of that. The actor is set to reprise his role of the Dark Knight in The Batman II, which has been in development for quite some time and is due to hit theaters in 2027. Pattinson is seemingly anxious to start filming the DC Studios movie. “I f***ing hope so,” Pattinson told Mickey 17 co-star Naomi Ackie in a conversation for Hero Magazine about playing the Caped Crusader again. “I started out as young Batman and I’m going to be f***ing old Batman by the sequel… I’m 38, I’m old.” Pattinson added, “I’m old, but I’m healthier. I think I’ve actually brought my biological age down a bit.” Watch on Deadline The Twilight alum spoke to Deadline at the London premiere of Mickey 17 where he said filming for The Batman sequel would start at the end of 2025. Although the actor couldn’t reveal plot details, he teased, “It’s cool.” The Batman was released in 2022 and is not part of the DC Universe James Gunn and Peter Safran are constructing, which will largely kick off with the release of Superman later this year. In an interview posted in September 2024, the filmmaker told SFX magazine that he planned to shoot in 2025 as he was “finishing up the script now.” “Colin [Farrell] will be part of the movie. We’ve shared [the script] as we’ve been going along with DC and the studio and they’re super excited,” Reeves told the magazine. Reeves noted that The Penguin, which stars Farrell as the Gotham City villain, is the “entry point” to the Batman sequel and it’s “absolutely connected to where we leave things in the series.” The filmmaker added that The Batman II is “going to dig into the epic story about deeper corruption, and it goes into places that he couldn’t anticipate in the first one. The seeds of where this goes are all in the first movie, and it expands in a way that will show you aspects of the character you never got to see.”",
