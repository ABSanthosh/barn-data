  "text": "Miley Cyrus continues the rollout for her upcoming album “Something Beautiful” with the release of her new single “End of the World,” along with a sultry music video. Cyrus is silhouetted hazily dancing in front of the band before a close-up has her writhing on the ground in a green sequined dress. Seen through a gauzy filter, she sings “Let’s pretend it’s not the end of the world” in the song that also references partying like Paul McCartney and driving out to Malibu for one last time. “Show me how you’d hold me if tomorrow wasn’t coming for sure,” she sings. In March, Cyrus announced her upcoming visual album “Something Beautiful,” releasing May 30. Her ninth album is slated to include 13 original tracks and is executive produced by Cyrus and Shawn Everett, who previously worked with Alabama Shakes and Kacey Musgraves. Though little is known about the record at large, Cyrus previously said that it’s inspired by Pink Floyd’s “The Wall.” Popular on Variety “My idea was making ‘The Wall,’ but with a better wardrobe and more glamorous and filled with pop culture,” she told Harper’s Bazaar in November, describing the album as “hypnotizing and glamorous.” “It’s a concept album that’s an attempt to medicate somewhat of a sick culture through music.” Less than a week after announcing “Something Beautiful,” she dropped the first two songs from “Something Beautiful” — the spoken-word “Prelude” and the rock-meets-soul title track. The latter got the music video treatment with explosive visuals directed by Cyrus, Jacob Bixenman, and Brendan Walter, with cinematography by Benoît Debie. The album will be accompanied by a film that’s set for release in June. The film is produced by Cyrus, XYZ Films and Panos Cosmatos in collaboration with Sony Music Vision, Columbia Records and Live Nation. Cyrus is directing alongside Bixenman and Walter.
