  "text": "A\u0026E has set the premiere date for “Duck Dynasty: The Revival” for Wednesday, May 28 at 9 p.m. ET/PT. In January, the network announced the revival of the once-massively popular series, which in 2014 became a headache for A\u0026E. In a profile in GQ, “Duck Dynasty” patriarch Phil Robertson made homophobic and racist remarks, leading to A\u0026E suspending him, which then caused outrage among right-wing pundits. Regardless, the show’s ratings declined, and it eventually ended in 2017. The official synopsis for the 10-episode revival reads: “As the family business expands beyond ducks, Willie and Korie Robertson bring their signature wit and down-home charm while they explore the future of Duck Commander, support their children through marriage, parenthood, and entrepreneurship, and work to keep their legacy alive. However, Willie quickly realizes that this next generation isn’t as Robertson as he originally thought.” “The Revival” was given a two season, 20-episode order, meaning that more is to come. At the original show’s height during fall 2013, “Duck Dynasty” was averaging as much as 14.6 million viewers in Live+7 ratings.  Popular on Variety This new season is produced by Wheelhouse’s Spoke Studios and Tread Lively Productions for A\u0026E. A\u0026E holds exclusive worldwide distribution rights. PROGRAMMING A new game show called “Greg Gutfeld’s What Did I Miss?” is set to debut on FOX Nation, with host Greg Gutfeld. The series premieres over a three-day window. The first episode releases May 12, with the subsequent two releasing May 13 and 14. The show features four participants who were cut off from technology, including the internet, social media, television and phones, during a stay in upstate New York from January 20 to April 13. They must compete in front of a live audience and panel to correctly parse what news stories occurred during their isolation. The prize is $50,000. “Truth can be stranger than fiction and who better to help isolated Americans catch up on the headlines they missed during an unprecedented news cycle than Greg Gutfeld,” Lauren Petterson, FOX Nation president, said in a statement. “We are excited for FOX Nation subscribers to have exclusive access to America’s most-watched late night host’s game show debut as he informs contestants about what really happened while they were completely off the grid and isolated from the outside world.” CASTING Simon Helberg (“The Big Bang Theory”) and Raegan Revord (“Young Sheldon”) are set to guest star on “Night Court” Season 3’s finale. Helberg will make a cameo — in a “Big Bang” reunion — that, according to an official synopsis, “could really shake things up for Abby,” the judge on the show played by Melissa Rauch. Revord will play a teenage runaway named Shelby who is driven to marry her soulmate. Additionally, Marsha Warfield is returning to reprise her role as Roz from the original series. Helberg is also set to return for “Poker Face” Season 2 opposite Natasha Lyonne and is currently in production on Jonathan Glatzer’s “The Audacity” for AMC alongside Billy Magnussen and Zach Galifianakis. The “Night Court” Season 3 finale is set to air Tuesday, May 6 at 8:30 pm. ET/PT.",
