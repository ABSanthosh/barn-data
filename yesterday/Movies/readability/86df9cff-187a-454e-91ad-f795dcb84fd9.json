  "text": "Featured on IndieWire’s Most Anticipated Films of 2025, Maggie Gyllenhaal‘s upcoming sophomore directorial entry “The Bride!” is shaping up to be one wild ride. With Christian Bale and Jessie Buckley leading as Frankenstein’s monster and his eponymous Bride, the film is a family affair with Gyllenhaal’s husband, Peter Sarsgaard, her brother Jake Gyllenhaal also featured, as well as Penélope Cruz, Annette Bening, and Julianne Hough. Sarsgaard also brought his “September 5” co-star, John Magaro onto the project. In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Magaro discussed getting to work on the film, which he described as a mash-up of dance films and movies about bandits in love. “It’s a wild movie. It’s very different than ‘The Lost Daughter,’ Maggie’s previous film that she directed,” said Magaro. “It’s like a mix of a Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers movie, ‘Young Frankenstein,’ ‘Frankenstein,’ ‘Bonnie and Clyde,’ and ‘Badlands.’ It’s just a wild, fun ride, and at the helm is Christian Bale and the amazing Jessie Buckley. It’s something that people haven’t seen before, and I’m really excited to get it in front of an audience. It’s bonkers.” Popular on IndieWire Magaro has kept busy the last year, with a leading role in awards contender “September 5” and a supporting part in the Showtime series “The Agency” on top of his work in “The Bride!” He also has the film “Omaha” premiering at Sundance this week and “Köln 75” debuting at Berlinale in March, not to mention a small part in Kelly Reichardt’s latest project, “The Mastermind.” The film stars Josh O’Connor, Alana Haim, Hope Davis, and Bill Camp and is described as “an audacious art heist amidst the backdrop of the Vietnam War.” Magaro discussed the production in a recent interview with IndieWire’s Kate Erbland, saying, “It was such a homecoming just being on set with these people, mostly the same crew [from ‘First Cow’], they all come back to work with her. There’s something familial about that set. And there’s also just a brilliance at work. I mean, Kelly is brilliant. I’m really excited to see ‘The Mastermind.’ It’s going to be fantastic. I’m already confident in that. Because she has a true appreciation for cinema at the expense of maybe having a popular appeal at times, her appreciation for cinema is evident in the execution. You can’t help but be infected by that passion.” It may seem like a lot to handle, but Magaro is counting his blessing being able to have so many opportunities to practice his craft. Especially in today’s industry, when work is becoming harder and harder to come by. “I feel very fortunate because I am hearing about so many of my peers and colleagues who aren’t working due to the contraction in the business after all these events,” Magaro said to THR. “I’m constantly hearing about below-the-line grips and gaffers who can’t find work. Now, we have these fires in L.A., and L.A.’s film industry has already been so ravaged. So I feel very lucky to keep working, and that’s why I’m always excited to jump at opportunities. I know how tough this business is, and I know that it’s only getting more and more difficult.” “Septemeber 5” is currently in theaters from Paramount Pictures.",
