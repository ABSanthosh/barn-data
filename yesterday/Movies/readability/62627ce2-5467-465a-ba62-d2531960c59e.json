  "text": "With Bryan Cranston reprising his lovable goofball patriarch Hal in the Malcolm in the Middle reboot, he’s flexing some old acting muscles. After reminding fans of his physical comedy chops in the Season 1 finale of The Studio, the Oscar nominee teased more slapstick laughs to come in the upcoming revival of his Fox sitcom, which ran for seven seasons from 2000 to 2006. “I’m asked to do physical comedy on that show and I realized, ‘Oh, it’s been 20 years since I did that,'” he told IndieWire. “I have a few extra restrictions now, so it’s like I’m crawling around. I’m, of course, naked again. That’s no surprise, no surprise at all.” Watch on Deadline Ahead of the show’s 25th anniversary, a Disney+ revival was announced for a limited, four-episode run in December, with Frankie Muniz returning as Malcolm, alongside Cranston and Jane Kaczmarek reprising their roles as his parents Hal and Lois. After the new and returning cast was rounded out in March, Muniz shared a behind-the-scenes photo with his onscreen parents. “Always good to have Mom and Dad around!!” he captioned the pic last month. Last month, Muniz celebrated wrapping the reboot after reprising the titular gifted child growing up with three brothers in a middle-class home.",
