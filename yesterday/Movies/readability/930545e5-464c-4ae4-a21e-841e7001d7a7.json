But it's not easy to provide this kind of peace when there is so much raging going on. Way too many films nowadays feel the need to address the problems with the world by simply showing us the problems and using cinema to express some kind of anger. As if just showing us what is wrong will help us solve what is wrong – it rarely ever does. However, we really do need a bit of peace and calm these days, some soothing quieter moments to allow us to take a breath and become whole again. Miroirs No. 3, which is also simply titled Mirrors No. 3 in English, is the 11th feature film made by prolific German filmmaker Christian Petzold (also the director of Barbara, Phoenix, Transit, Undine, Afire). And it's just delightful – one of my favorite Petzold films already. Not at all what I was expecting, and that's a good thing, because I'm glad to discover it's such a charming \u0026 healing work of cinema. For 86 minutes we can get a bit of relief in Petzold's journey out to the German countryside. Written and directed by Christian Petzold, Miroirs No. 3 is his fourth collaboration with his muse – the very talented German actress Paula Beer, who has also starred in Transit, Undine, \u0026 Afire previously. Petzold must really be going through something in his life right now. Between Afire and this new film, he is clearly working through some depression and frustration, and he's putting all of that up on screen. It feels like with Miroirs No. 3 he has finally figured out what it takes to really achieve some peace. Beer stars Laura, a young woman who is suddenly taken by her boyfriend on a trip from Berlin out to some lake. She's depressed and tells him when they arrive she wants to go home – but the car crashes on the way back and her boyfriend dies. This is where the film really begins, as a woman (played by the wonderful Barbara Auer) at a house nearby where they crash decides to take her in and watch over her. Laura is unharmed but decides to stay with this woman anyway, though there's another reason why she wants her to stay. The film feels lightly inspired by Bergman and/or Hitchcock stories where not all is as it seems as the story plays out. It's a lovely, light, breezy minimalistic mystery that really won me over by the end – a nice balm for any of your troubles. Of course the film can be viewed as yet another story about grief and overcoming tragedy. I think it is less about that and more about the process of healing \u0026 what it really takes. Even if what it takes is going down a peculiar \u0026 slightly deceptive path. I was deeply moved by how calm and relaxing this film is, never jumping into anything upsetting or unsettling. Even though it feels like something might happen at any minute, once you understand where the story is headed and it stays right on course it has great power in being a deeply healing work of art. Paula Beer is always wonderful but it's Barbara Auer who soothed me. Her performance as Betty, even though she keeps secrets and is working through her own troubles, is the real heart \u0026 soul of the film. Her warmth and her charm shines through in every scene. The film's minimalistic story and setting at a quiet house far from the bustling nearby city of Berlin is also so soothing. I am seriously touched by how simplistic this film is and how that minimalism makes a great difference in allowing this story be affecting. We don't always need overly complex, dense plots for cinema to actually provide real comfort and solace to viewers. I'm glad Petzold figured out how to share this balm of a story with us in this tender \u0026 moving way.
