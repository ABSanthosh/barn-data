  "text": "'The Real Housewives of Miami' Bravo Bravo is teasing the return of The Real Housewives of Miami after a lengthy absence. Season 7 of the reality TV series is set to air in the coming months, more than a year after the show last aired on Bravo. Alexia Nepola, Larsa Pippen, Lisa Hochstein, Guerdy Abraira, Julia Lemigova, Adriana de Moura, Marysol Patton, and Kiki Barth are all set to return to the series. The teaser, which aired during the last episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, showed the silhouette of the Miami housewives dancing. One of the housewives not returning for Season 7 is Nicole Martin, who confirmed her exit in September 2024, citing postpartum anxiety.

Prioritizing my health and my family is something I need to do at this moment. It’s a step towards healing and finding balance, and I hope you can understand and support this choice,” Martin said. During Bravo FanFest in Miami last November 2024, co-star Nepola talked to Deadline about Martin’s exit. “I actually called Nicole and I told her that I thought she was making the right decision for herself and for her family,” Nepola told us. “I was sad, because I always had the hope of being good friends with her on the show, because I felt like she and I had a lot of things in common, and we would be good friends one day. So I’m bummed that she didn’t come back, but I know that that was a good and right decision for her family.” RELATED: Jax Taylor Teases ‘The Valley’ Season 2 Will Show Him At His “Most Vulnerable State” \u0026 Reveals How He Deals With Social Media Criticism Watch the RHOM teaser in the video below.
