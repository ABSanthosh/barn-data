  "description": "Time for a peek inside that baggage. Thanks to our friends over at Short of the Week, here's a fantastic new animated short to enjoy. Baggage is a 5-min stop-motion animated film from Australian filmmaker Lucy Davidson. After working on Adam Elliot's Memoir of a Snail in Australia, she was selected to work at the Aardman Animation Studios Academy and create this film as her own personal project. The short is a funny riff of \"emotional baggage\" and the secrets hidden within each \u0026 every one of us. Three girlfriends check in their baggage at the airport, but one is carrying a little more than the others. Can she hide what's inside? With the voices of Eve Eloise Gilbert, Sophie Schoorman, Dominik Shields, and Camillo Sancisi. This has a very funny Aardman vibe to it, with the characters being so emotive. But it also feels like its own creation sharing the ideas in Lucy's mind and what she wants us to think about when we're out in the world. Thanks to Short of the Week for the tip on this debuting online. Brief intro from YouTube: \"Three girlfriends check in their baggage at the airport, but one is carrying a […]",
