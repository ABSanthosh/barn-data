  "text": "Adam Sandler has called in his team of all-stars for “Happy Gilmore 2.” Yes, the long-awaited sequel to the iconic 1996 sports comedy is actually finally happening, and there are more than a few starry cameos on the green. Sandler reprises his role as the titular unsuccessful ice hockey player turned unlikely golf pro. He is joined again by Julie Bowen and Christopher McDonald, who both are back in the roles they starred in for the 1996 original. Travis Kelce, Bad Bunny, Kid Cudi, and Sandler’s “Uncut Gems” director Benny Safdie also are in the sequel, with Sandler telling IndieWire that Safdie has a “juicy part.” Rory McIlroy, Scottie Scheffler, Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka, Justin Thomas, and Will Zalatoris also star. “Happy Gilmore 2” is directed by Kyle Newacheck (“Workaholics,” “What We Do in the Shadows”), who also previously helmed Sandler’s 2019 film “Murder Mystery.” Sandler cowrote “Happy Gilmore 2” with Tim Herlihy, who also cowrote the original. Sandler recently lamented the loss of former “Happy Gilmore” actor, alligator Morris, who died at an estimated age of 80. In the 1996 film, Morris infamously is confronted by Sandler’s Happy; Morris grabs a golf ball on the green, leading Happy to realize that it is the same gator who chomped on the hand of his mentor, Chubbs (Carl Weathers). “Goodbye, Morris. We are all gonna miss you,” Sandler tweeted after the news of Morris’ passing was made public May 12. “You could be hard on directors, make-up artists, costumers — really anyone with arms or legs — but I know you did it for the ultimate good of the film.” Sandler recalled how much the animal actor was missed on set for the sequel, saying, “I know your character’s decapitation in the first movie precluded your participation in the sequel, but we all appreciated the fruit basket and the hilarious note,” he quipped. “I will miss the sound of your tail sliding through the tall grass, your cold, bumpy skin, but, most of all, I will miss your infectious laugh. Thanks to Mr. Young for taking care of you all these years, and vaya con dios, old friend.” “Happy Gilmore 2” premieres July 25 on Netflix. Check out the trailer below.",
