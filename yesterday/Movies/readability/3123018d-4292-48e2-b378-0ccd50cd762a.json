  "text": "Posted in: Marvel Studios, Movies | Tagged: the new avengers, thunderboltsThere's a line at the end of TÃ∂hÃ∂uÃ∂nÃ∂dÃ∂eÃ∂rÃ∂bÃ∂oÃ∂lÃ∂tÃ∂sÃ∂* The New Avengers, which seems like a throwaway joke, but hits different as someone who also has mental health struggles. Thunderbolts* The New Avengers¬†was not exactly a subtle movie when it came to talking about mental health. That isn't a bad thing; sometimes you need to go over the top to get the point across. This is a movie where you could reasonably argue that the day was saved through the power of love and friendship. Bob is the center of that, but all of the characters in this film have to contend with the sides of themselves that they'd rather avoid. There is a line during the second post-credits scene that feels different to someone who has experienced their own version of a Void Room. Bob, while never said in the film, judging from the way he describes his episodes, is somewhere in the realm of manic depressive and bipolar. When you're in that high, flying doesn't feel far out of the realm of possibility. It's so strong that often people stop taking their medication during these highs because the good feelings are intense. The low moments, the depressive episodes, those are something else. Thunderbolts* The New Avengers naming it as a \"void\" is very accurate. As someone who first realized there was something mentally wrong with her in the sixth grade and finally got help in the seventh, I've been playing the depression game for decades now. It's a common conception that depression is just really intense sadness. What is much more common when you're in a low moment is apathy. It's apathy for nearly every aspect of your life. It's apathy regarding your friends, your loved ones, your job, your house, and yourself. It's so heavy and all-consuming that it sits on your entire body like a 300-lb weight, anchoring you to a bed you can't bring yourself to get out of. You stop seeing the people you care about and stop doing very basic things to take care of yourself, like showering, eating, or cleaning your home. In the post-credits scene for Thunderbolts* The New Avengers,¬†they are talking about how they need to get the jet ready, and it's mentioned how they wish Bob could use his powers so he could fly. It's an exchange played for laughs. Alexei seems into the idea of \"riding on a flying Bob into battle,\" but that's not something they can do. Bob reminds them that they can't have the Sentry without the Void. \"But I did the dishes!\" he finishes with a certain level of enthusiasm, and it was like a gut punch that I missed the first time I saw the film. Suddenly, I saw my own piles of laundry during my past depressive episodes, the dusty tables, and the piles of dishes. Sometimes, it takes everything in you to cook food, so doing the dishes is out of the question, and they just pile up. Bob's enthusiasm for what he contributed to his shared household, doing the dishes, was one of those little lines you could read into. Did the writers of this scene intend to reference the fact that depressed and mentally ill people sometimes get overwhelmed, and the dishes can feel like an accomplishment? Maybe, maybe not, but as someone who has been there and had to celebrate a little victory like doing the dishes? Bob's enthusiasm is rightfully earned.
