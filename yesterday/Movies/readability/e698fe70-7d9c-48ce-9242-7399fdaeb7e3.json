  "text": "After dominating his category this award season, Kieran Culkin completed the sweep taking home the prize for Best Supporting Actor at this years Oscars. After accepting the Oscar from last year’s winner Robert Downey Jr. Culkin thanked several people including his director and writer Jessie Eisenberg with the kindest compliment. “Thank you for this movie, you’re a genius, I will never say it to your face, so soak it up,” Culkin said. Competing against Culkin in the category were Guy Pearce from The Brutalist, Yuriy Borisov for Anora, Edward Norton for A Complete Unknown and Jeremy Strong for The Apprentice. Culkin has dominated the supporting actor category this award season, taking home several accolades including a Golden Globe and most recently the SAG award for best supporting actor. Culkin won an Emmy last year for best supporting actor in a Drama series for his performance in the HBO hit drama Succession. In that speech, he had told his wife he wanted a third kid and this year he added on to that story and had a new request. Watch on Deadline “About a year ago, I was on stage and I very stupidly asked her for a third kid, turns out she said that cause she thought I wouldn’t win,” Culkin said. “So we are walking through the parking lot looking for our car and she goes, “Oh god I did say that I guess I owe you a third kid,” and I turned to her and said really I want four. She turned to me and said, I will give you four, when you win an Oscar.” Culkin went on to say, “No pressure, I love you, I’m really sorry I did this again, and lets get cracking on those kids, what do you say.” The victory marked the first win for the Searchlight Pictures dramedy that also stars Jessie Eisenberg. It is also up for best Original screenplay by Eisenberg.",
