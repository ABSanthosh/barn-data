  "text": "Adam Scott won’t be hosting “Saturday Night Live” this season (his “Innie” won’t get the chance either), and Ben Stiller thinks that’s a shame. But Scott seems willing to take Lorne Michaels’ call should there be one for Season 51. “SNL” on Thursday announced its final three hosts for Season 50, starting with Quinta Brunson, followed by the hosting debut of Walton Goggins, and concluding with Scarlett Johansson. Shortly after the cork board announcement from the show was posted, Stiller responded to a comment saying it was a “missed opportunity fr” that Scott wasn’t among them, simply saying, “I agree.” IndieWire spoke with Scott on the red carpet where he’s being honored for the annual Time 100 gala (his old “Parks and Recreation” co-star Nick Offerman wrote up the blurb naming Scott one of the 100 most influential people of the year). When asked if he was interested in hosting the legendary variety show, Scott said “Of course. It would be amazing.” “‘SNL’ is, I think it’s hard to argue it’s not the greatest show on television because of its longevity and because of its influence on culture,” Scott said. “50 years of really kind of guiding culture in a lot of ways but also reacting to culture at the same time. The cast right now is unbelievable. They’re really in one of their peaks, I think. So yeah, of course. It would be amazing.” While “SNL” lampooned buzzy series and films like “The White Lotus” and “Anora” and even brought Oscar winner Mikey Madison on to host, “Severance” has gotten the short shrift, but we’d love to see what they can do with all the inscrutable goat stuff on the Apple TV+ show. And we’d love to see Scott reunite with “SNL” great Amy Poehler; we bet she could do a great Harmony Cobel. “SNL” returns May 3 with the return of Brunson to Studio 8H, and Season 50 concludes on May 17. “Severance” will also return for a third season after receiving critical praise and dominating streaming charts in its return for Season 2. Check out IndieWire’s clip with Scott below.",
