  "text": "The Entertainment Industry Foundation‘s Defy:Disaster program has been activated to provide funding and vital services to those impacted by the devastating Franklin Fire in Malibu. The program offers members of the entertainment community and the public an immediate way to offer vital support to firefighters, first responders, and communities affected by disasters. “Our community has given generously during times of disaster,” said EIF President and CEO Nicole Sexton. “By donating to Defy:Disaster, we can support our firefighters, provide shelter and food for those in need, and care for animals that are displaced.” Following the deadly Camp and Woolsey Fires in 2018, EIF directed more than $2 million to first responders across California, as well as other organizations that provide long-term aid to survivors. In 2020, EIF and its philanthropic partners supporting disaster response granted over $14 million to more than 100 organizations. Watch on Deadline To donate to Defy:Disaster, please go to eifoundation.org/defydisaster. The Franklin Fire, driven by ferocious Santa Ana winds, has burned more than 2,800 acres since it erupted late Monday night. The fire is zero percent contained.
