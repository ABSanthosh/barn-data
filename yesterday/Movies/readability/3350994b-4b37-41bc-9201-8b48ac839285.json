From all of us at FirstShowing.net, we want to wish every one our readers a very Merry Christmas and a Happy Holidays! Whether you're in hanging out at home alone, spending the time with family or friends, or just with your partner; or whether it's snowing or sunny where you are, we hope you have a lovely weekend full of relaxation and warmth and smiles. Despite many challenges \u0026 setbacks in 2024, amazing movies always keep us entertained \u0026 inspired. Thanks for reading and thanks for following FS throughout this year. And the past few years. It has been a rough year for websites, especially independent ones like this (read more). As always, the movies and all the movie lovers are what keep us going. Stay healthy, stay happy, stay sane. News \u0026 trailers always slow down during the holidays, but we'll be operating at full-speed again once it is 2025 - the year of more Avatar and Jurassic World and Superman. Keep an eye out for a few more updates as we head right into the New Year. The charming \"Yoda Claus\" artwork seen above comes from a 1994 trading card. Art by Ralph McQuarrie. 2024 has been a mixed year for cinema - a few really incredible films (Anora, The Brutalist, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Alien: Romulus to name some of the better ones) along with plenty of duds \u0026 let downs, too. There's always more to see. Movies now available to watch as of Christmas Day: the animated LOTR movie The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim; Barry Jenkins' unexciting \"live-action\" lions sequel / prequel combo Mufasa: The Lion King; the other sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 3; Robert Eggers' mysterious and chilling new take on the vampire Nosferatu; a true story boxing drama set in Flint, MI called The Fire Inside; the boring bad guy comic book villain movie Kraven; the riveting, impressive Timothée Chalamet as Bob Dylan film A Complete Unknown. And leftover from Thanksgiving: the two big hit sequels Moana 2 \u0026 Gladiator II, plus the spectacular musical Wicked (now with special sing-a-long showings at many theaters). The 2025 holiday line-up is already shaping up, with a few movies already scheduled for next December so far. Currently set to debut in December 2025: Blumhouse's sequel Five Nights at Freddy's 2 (on Dec. 5); James Cameron's highly anticipated Avatar 3: Fire and Ash (on Dec. 19) along with The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants also on the same day (on Dec. 19); and arriving on Christmas Day is The Anaconda remake with Jack Black \u0026 Paul Rudd, Paul Feig's thriller The Housemaid with Sydney Sweeney \u0026 Amanda Seyfried, faith-focused oil movie Sarah's Oil, plus Josh Safdie's ping pong movie Marty Supreme starring Timothée Chalamet. That's all so far... Enjoy the last few days of 2024. And get ready for an exciting 2025. Find more posts in: General, To Watch prev next",
