Meanwhile, Chapter 288 largely focuses on the inclusion of Yukimiya Kenyu in Bastard Munchen and Paris X Gen’s game. With Gurimu’s exit from the clash, Noel Noa brings Kenyu to the game to enhance the attack of Bastard Munchen. As the game is approaching its conclusion, both teams are eager to make a goal. Upon entering the match, Kenyu receives a pass from Gagamaru Gin. Thus, he uses his dribbling tactics to coordinate with Isagi and Kaiser. However, what looks like the perfect coordination, ends as it was actually Kenyu’s plan to use Isagi to get closer to the goal. This move by the substitute catches Isagi off-guard, while Kenyu attempts a solo goal.",
