When September is suspended from school, her sister, July, begins to explore her own independence. Tension in the family builds while on holiday in Ireland as a series of surreal encounters test the them all to their limit. A dark and unsettling exploration of sisterhood from writer-director Ariane Labed. Starring Mia Tharia and Pascale Kann as the two sisters, along with Rakhee Thakrar. Adapted from the novel \"Sisters\" written by Daisy Johnson. This earned some positive reviews from festivals last year - in which they state that the film is: \"An elegantly unmoored tale of two sisters that, in its tart and tense examination of codependency and the isolation it breeds, shares a kinship with Athina Rachel Tsangari’s haunting Attenberg and the darkly absurdist satires of Yorgos Lanthimos.\" This does look quite creepy and strange - perhaps a bit too strange for most people to enjoy. Have a look. Here's the official trailer […]",

Have a look. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Ariane Labed's film September Says, direct from YouTube: Sisters July \u0026 September are thick as thieves, though very different – September is protective \u0026 distrustful of others, while July is open to \u0026 curious about the world. Their dynamic is a concern to their single mum, Sheela, who is unsure what to do with them. When September is suspended from their school, July is left to fend for herself and begins to assert her own independence - which does not go unnoticed by September. Tension among the three women builds when they take refuge in an old holiday home in Ireland, where July finds her bond with September shifting in ways she cannot entirely understand or control - and a series of surreal encounters test the family to their limit. September Says is written and directed by Greek-French actress filmmaker Ariane Labed, making her feature directorial debut with this project after one other short previously. Adapted from Daisy Johnson's novel titled \"Sisters\". Produced by Ed Guiney, Lara Hickey, Chelsea Morgan Hoffmann, \u0026 Andrew Lowe. This premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival last year. Mubi will debut Labed's September Says in select theaters soon - check your local listings for details. Find more posts in: Indies, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
