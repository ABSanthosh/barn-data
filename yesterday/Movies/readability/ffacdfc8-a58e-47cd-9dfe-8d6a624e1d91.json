  "text": "Los Angeles Rams star Cooper Kupp is being traded during the NFL off-season, the wide receiver said on social media. The Rams will miss one of its key players when the 2025 season begins later this year, despite Kupp not wanting to leave the team. “I was informed that the team will be seeking a trade immediately and will be working with me and my family to find the right place to continue competing for championships,” Kupp shared on social media. “I don’t agree with the decision and always believed it was going to begin and end in LA.” He continued, “Still, if there’s one thing that I have learned over the years: there are so many things that are out of your control, but it is how you respond to these things that you will look back on and remember.” Watch on Deadline Kupp was drafted by the Rams in 2017 as a third-round pick and won Super Bowl LVI in 2022 with the team. In the same 2021 season, Kupp was the Super Bowl LVI MVP and the triple crown king, leading the league in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns. “I have taken so much pride in playing alongside my teammates for the LA community, so thank you for embracing my family and making this such a special place for us,” he added. “2024 began with one of the best training camps of my career. Preparations start now for 2025. Highly motivated, as healthy as ever, and looking forward to playing elite football for years to come. Love you guys.. But coming for it all.” Kupp has suffered several injuries in the past seasons, being placed on injured reserve in 2023 due to a lingering hamstring injury. In 2024, he sustained an ankle injury in Week 2 and was out for four weeks.",
