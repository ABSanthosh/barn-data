  "text": "AMC revealed the first 14 minutes of Sunday’s episode of “The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon – The Book of Carol” Friday during New York Comic Con, which featured the on-screen reunion between Norman Reedus‘ Daryl Dixon and Melissa McBride‘s Carol Peletier. “The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon – The Book of Carol” picks up where the first season of “Daryl Dixon” left off, following fan-favorite characters Daryl Dixon (Reedus) and Carol Peletier (McBride). They both confront old demons while she fights to find her friend and he struggles with his decision to stay in France, causing tension at the Nest. Additionally, Genet (Anne Charrier)’s movement builds momentum, setting Pouvoir on a violent collision course with the Union of Hope in the fight for France’s future. The sneak peek of the opening of Episode 4, which was not included in the NYCC livestream and was exclusively for fans in attendance at the panel at the Javits Center, showed the moment when Carol finds Daryl in prison in France. Popular on Variety Reedus broke down his reaction to the emotional plot point for Daryl, saying “the one person in the world that he needs is right there.” “It’s hard for me to watch it and not tear up a little bit, as corny as that sounds,” Reedus said. “The thing about that relationship is when we started [‘The Walking Dead’], it was about Rick. The show was about Rick. It was about Rick’s journey, and everybody around Rick, right? And it branched off into everything. But these two characters were always watching out for each other the whole time. And they got bigger. nd then we got Cherokee Rose, and then that was a thing. And they were always bonded, and they both come from a place of abuse, and they just always had each other’s back. So when you see them on screen now, it’s earned. It’s not two actors playing the part of somebody. They’ve known each other, it’s for real. So when we do scenes together, and she tears up, I tear up. The bond is so strong, but you can feel it’s real.” McBride added: “Norman and I don’t do a whole lot of rehearsing or talking about scenes that we’re going to do. We just show up as the character, knowing where we are in the story and letting things happen as we shoot. And that’s what I love about working with Norman; you never know what you’re going to get. And it’s always so fun and wonderful and surprising.” The “Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon – The Book of Carol” panel featured Reedus and McBride alongside “Walking Dead” universe chief content officer Scott M. Gimple, showrunner David Zabel, director and executive producer Greg Nicotero, and cast member Louis Puech Scigliuzzi.",
