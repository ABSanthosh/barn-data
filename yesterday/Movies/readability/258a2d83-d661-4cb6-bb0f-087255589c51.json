What do we know about Citadel Season 2’s status? According to a new report from THR, the Amazon MGM spy series has officially been pushed back, with Citadel Season 2 being moved from a fall 2025 release to sometime in the spring of 2026. Furthermore, various planned Citadel spin-off series were put on hold until the second season debuted. THR’s report notes that the reason for all of this is due to Amazon MGM being “unhappy” with what they’ve seen of Season 2 so far. While the report doesn’t go into detail, it does mention that an insider with the company said that Amazon has set no date at all for a return for the series. As far as Citadel’s spin-offs go, the report mentions that the original plan was to have “multiple international” series come from the spy franchise, like the Italian Citadel: Diana, and the Indian Citadel: Honey Bunny, both of which premiered in 2024. However, development on any future projects has officially been halted, as it seems like Amazon would rather put its full focus into making sure Season 2 of the series is a hit. Citadel stars Richard Madden as Mason Kane, Priyanka Chopra Jonas as Nadia Sinh, Lesley Manville as Dahlia Archer, Stanley Tucci as Bernard Orlick, Osy Ikhile as Carter Spence, Ashleigh Cummings as Abby Conroy, Roland Møller as Anders Silje and Davik Silje, Caoilinn Springall as Hendrix Conroy, and more. Both Matt Berry and Gabriel Leone, as well as Jack Reynor (The Peripheral) have also been reported to have joined the Season 2 cast. (Source: The Hollywood Reporter)",
