  "text": "The Critics Choice awards has now set a new ceremony date for Friday, Feb. 7. The show will still be held at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica with Chelsea Handler still on board to host. The show was initially scheduled for Sunday, Jan. 12, and then postponed to Jan. 26 due to the devastating Los Angeles wildfires, has been delayed once again. The ceremony, celebrating its 30th anniversary, is set to take place sometime in February, with an official date to be announced in the coming days. It will still be held at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica. The live broadcast will air on E! and be made available the following day on Peacock, allowing domestic and international audiences to tune in. Chelsea Handler remains on board as the host, promising an evening that balances celebration, respect and resilience during a difficult time for the community. The Critics Choice Awards is one of many Hollywood events upended by the fires that began on Jan. 7, which have scorched large areas of Los Angeles County. With thousands of structures destroyed and mass evacuations affecting nearly 200,000 residents, the crisis has impacted the heart of the entertainment industry. Popular on Variety Multiple award ceremonies and related events have been delayed or rescheduled. The American Society of Cinematographers and Producers Guild of America postponed their nominations announcements, while the ACE Eddie Awards ceremony, initially slated for Jan. 18, has been pushed back. Most notably, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences extended its Oscars voting window until Friday, Jan. 17, and delayed its nominations announcement until Thursday, Jan. 23. Amid the destruction, Angelenos have rallied together to support those affected. Contributions are pouring into organizations such as the California Fire Foundation, the L.A. Fire Department Foundation, and the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, leading efforts to provide aid and relief. Multiple networks, studios, and music labels have donated millions to help those affected. Despite the challenges, the Critics Choice Awards remains one of the season’s most anticipated events, recognizing excellence across film and television. This year’s nominations are led by Edward Berger’s gripping religious thriller “Conclave” and Jon M. Chu’s blockbuster musical “Wicked,” which each earned an impressive 11 nominations.",
