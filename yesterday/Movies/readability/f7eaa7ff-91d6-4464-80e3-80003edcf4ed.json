  "text": "Is the Hollywood Sign on fire? As wildfires rage across Los Angeles County, dramatic images showing the iconic landmark engulfed in flames have gone viral, sparking concern among residents and fans worldwide. But are these alarming photos real, or just another case of internet misinformation? Let’s break down the facts about the ongoing fires, the status of the Hollywood Sign, and how fake news is spreading in the midst of this devastating crisis. Is the Hollywood sign on fire? The Hollywood Sign is not on fire. Recent images and videos circulating on social media suggesting that the iconic landmark is burning have been confirmed to be false. Emergency services and trusted sources, including The Hollywood Sign Trust and ABC News, have verified that the sign remains intact, though visibility has been affected by smoke from surrounding wildfires. The Sunset Fire burns in Studio City near the Hollywood Hills but must cross the 101 Freeway to reach the sign. Although wildfires have impacted nearby areas, no active blaze currently threatens the landmark. The Los Angeles Fire Department issued evacuation orders for affected neighborhoods and continues efforts to contain the spread. Social media accounts, including Raw Alerts, were among the first to debunk the false claims. Screenshots from a live webcam trained on the Hollywood Sign show it remains in place, with no direct fire damage. Officials have emphasized that the AI-generated images circulating online contribute to misinformation during an ongoing crisis. The wildfires in Los Angeles County have caused major devastation. At least five people have died, with over 1,000 structures destroyed and more than 150,000 residents forced to evacuate. Fires have hit areas like Malibu, Pacific Palisades, and Altadena, damaging homes, businesses, and landmarks. Emergency crews are battling six major fires, hindered by dry weather and strong Santa Ana winds. Water shortages and limited resources have made firefighting harder. The fires destroyed historic sites, including the Andrew McNally House and the Bunny Museum. However, notable places like the Getty Villa remain safe. The wildfires continue to cause widespread evacuations and severe damage across Los Angeles.",
