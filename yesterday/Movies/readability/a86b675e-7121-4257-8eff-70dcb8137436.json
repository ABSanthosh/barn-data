  "text": "DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn has confirmed which scene from the first episode of Peacemaker Season 1 won’t be canon to the DC Universe. This comes ahead of the John Cena-led DCU series’ HBO Max return on August 21 for its long-awaited second season. Peacemaker is created, written, and directed by Gunn, who also serves as its showrunner. Season 2 will feature the return of Cena, Danielle Brooks, Jennifer Holland, Freddie Stroma, Steve Agee, and Robert Patrick. Joining them are new cast members Frank Grillo, David Denman, Sol Rodriguez, and Tim Meadows. Which Peacemaker Season 1 scene isn’t canon to the DCU? In the debut episode of the Peacemaker Podcast, Gunn shared some new behind-the-scenes stories and interesting details from Peacemaker Season 1 Episode 1. One of these details includes clarifying which scene from the episode was going to change due to the DCU. When asked about the opening scene from the first episode, which featured Cena’s Peacemaker hilariously arguing with a hospital worker about Aquaman, Gunn confirmed that fans will have to disregard the scene since Aquaman won’t be a famous superhero during the current timeline of his DCU. “One of the things that people are most confused by, as Peter Safran and I took over DC is, what is part of the DCU? This is the world that Superman lives in. This is the world that the Creature Commandos lives in. Up until this point, those are the only two things that are fully 100% canon. And the same thing is going to be true about Peacemaker Season 2. It’s fully 100% canon in the DC, but we did have to go back and change a few things from Season 1,” Gunn clarified. “Is Aquaman canon? We don’t know. But my guess, I don’t think Aquaman’s canon. It’s unlikely that Aquaman is a famous hero in the DCU as Superman and Peacemaker Season 2 is happening. That’s unlikely. But other than that, I really think everything in this episode, I think, is canon.” (Source: Threads) Originally reported by Maggie Dela Paz at SuperHeroHype.",
