  "text": "Sometimes, when you’re looking to be entertained, only a thriller will cut it. Sure, everybody loves a rom-com or an action movie, but If you ever find yourself feeling like life is getting inexplicably dark and morality is becoming more ambiguous, immersing yourself in a tense world of serial killers, terrorists, crooked sleazebags, and jaw-dropping twists of all kinds is a pretty great form of escapism. The genre is broad enough to encompass a wide variety of tropes. So you could probably watch thrillers forever and never get bored. Netflix‘s thriller offerings are surprisingly well-rounded this month, offering a good mix of undisputed classics from the likes of Steven Spielberg as well as newer indie flicks that you may have missed. This September, top-tier archival titles include “Oldboy” and “American Psycho” along with Netflix Originals like “Fair Play” and “Run Rabbit Run.” Whether you’re looking to revisit an old favorite, fill an embarrassing gap in your movie knowledge, or find something new and cutting-edge that will blow your mind, the thriller genre always has something for you. Popular on IndieWire Keep reading for 21 of our favorite thrillers streaming on Netflix in December 2024. With editorial contributions from Christian Zilko. 21. “Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile” ‘Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile’Netflix At first glance, the casting of Zac Efron as Ted Bundy seemed like an indulgence of all of the worst parts of mainstream true crime culture. As America’s fascination with serial killers continued to skyrocket, bringing in a former Disney star to play a brutal serial killer could have been a shameless attempt to cash in on the trend. But Efron delivers an excellent performance in a nuanced film that does nothing to glamorize the murderer, choosing instead to break down the cult of personality surrounding Bundy at every turn. —CZ 20. “Run Rabbit Run” ‘Run Rabbit Run’©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection Sarah Snook took on her first post-“Succession” leading role in this Australian thriller about a fertility doctor who begins to suspect that something is very, very wrong with her young daughter. In a performance that wildly diverges from her tightly-wound Waystar Royco heiress persona, Snook goes to great lengths to elevate a conventional thriller premise (complete with familiar tropes like ominous animal iconography) into one of the more entertaining films to hit Netflix in recent memory. Equal parts “The Babadook” and “We Need to Talk About Kevin,” it’s a film that will push you to your breaking point as quickly as Snook’s character reached hers. —CZ 19. “A Simple Favor” “M’A Simple Favor’Peter Iovino “A Simple Favor” is not a particularly successful thriller in terms of, er, thrilling you, but it does succeed wildly at entertaining you. Paul Feig’s comedic take on the genre is a lightly satirical look at mommy blogging culture and suburban discontent, filtered through the perspective of Anna Kendrick’s dissatisfied Stephanie. When her best friend, the highly successful Emily (Blake Lively) mysteriously disappears, Stephanie throws herself into the investigation and digs up dirt on her seemingly perfect counterpart. If “A Simple Favor” proves a bit wobbly, then Kendrick’s go-for-broke performance and the often genuinely funny script just as frequently steadies the ship. It’s less “Psycho” than it is “Desperate Housewives,” which will be music to anyone who misses “Desperate Housewives.” —WC 18. “Captain Phillips” ‘Captain Phillips’ ©Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection Paul Greengrass’ based-on-a-true-story action thriller “Captain Phillips” is handsomely mounted and made, but its primary virtue is as a vehicle for one of star Tom Hanks’ all-time best performances. He plays the title character, captain of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama which was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009. The film harks back to the classic Hanks vehicle “Cast Away,” detailing the innately likable actor’s struggles to survive in desperate circumstances. What elevates it is Greengrass’ muscular direction and the fine acting performances from the entire ensemble. Barkhad Abdi is excellent as pirate leader Abduwali Muse, making the character more than just a villain, but it’s really Hanks’s show, and his moment of anguish in the film’s finale may be the finest acting moment of his entire career. —WC 17. “Emily the Criminal” ‘Emily the Criminal’ screenshot A nasty crime thriller about how economic uncertainty can push people to desperate extremes, “Emily the Criminal” stars Aubrey Plaza as the titular Emily, a former art student whose college debt and former felony charge prevents her from escaping the drudgeries of service work. When a coworker connects her to a credit card fraud ring, Emily leaps at the opportunity to make some fast cash, and under the tutelage of organizer Youcef (Theo Rossi), she quickly becomes a natural at this very unsavory line of work. The screenplay is occasionally a bit silly, but John Patton Ford’s feature directorial debut shows great promise, and Plaza’s charismatic performance as an ordinary woman with a surprising capacity for violence and crime is damn near flawless. —WC 16. “Gerald’s Game” ‘Gerald’s Game’Netflix Stephen King’s chilling tale of bondage sex gone wrong was long thought to be unfilmable, due to so much of the novel “Gerald’s Game” taking place inside the mind of a woman who is chained to her bed. But “The Haunting of Hill House” creator Mike Flanagan found a way, turning the story into a chilling two-hander starring Carla Gugino and Bruce Greenwood that remains faithful to the novel while still thrilling viewers. —CZ 15. “Fair Play” ‘Fair Play’©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection The buzziest title of the 2023 Sundance Film Festival made its way to Netflix in October 2023 following a $20 million acquisition from the streaming giant. Chloe Domont’s take on the sexual power dynamics at the apex of the financial industry stunned Park City audiences by offering an unapologetic throwback to 1990s erotic thrillers like “Basic Instinct” and “Fatal Attraction” while still exploring contemporary gender politics. Phoebe Dynevor and Alden Ehrenreich star as two corporate climbers at an elite hedge fund whose dueling ambitions and depraved sexual chemistry reach a breaking point when her career begins to surpass his. It’s a non-stop thrill ride that never shies away from the ugly side of sex and is one of the most shocking titles to hit Netflix in 2024. —CZ 14. “The Guilty” ‘The Guilty’NETFLIX © 2021 It hews a tad too close to the story of the Danish film it is originally based on, but Jake Gyllenhaal’s one-man show “The Guilty” is still very much a clever, worthy watch. Antoine Fuqua directs the crime thriller, which casts Gyllenhaal as a police detective demoted to 911 phone operator duty who scrambles alone at his desk during the night shift to help save a caller who claims to have been abducted. For nearly the entire film, Gyllenhaal is the only face on screen, communicating with a parade of voices played by actors like Ethan Hawke, Riley Keough, Eli Goree, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Paul Dano, and Peter Sarsgaard. It works because Gyllenhaal, with his famously expressive eyes and hyper-intense performing style, is precisely the type of actor who’s capable of carrying a thriller like this, and his growing distress makes “The Guilty” the most nerve-wracking way to spend 90 minutes watching a man sitting at a desk. —WC 13. “Missing” ‘Missing’©Sony Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection It’s not really a spinoff set of “Searching,” the 2018 screenlife thriller starring John Cho, but it does ostensibly take place in the same universe. And yet, 2023’s “Missing” was a pleasant surprise, a well-directed and well-told standalone mystery that succeeds in entertaining on its own terms. First-time directors Will Merrick and Nick Johnson make great use of the screenlife format to document main character June Allen’s (Storm Reid) desperate quest to track down her missing mother, using the cascading and constant torrent of information as a manifestation of the dead ends and red herrings she has to dig through. Reid is a solid and likable lead, giving the audience a reason to care as the investigation falls quickly out of June’s control. —WC 12. “The Killer” ‘The Killer’©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection David Fincher’s latest is one of his slightest works, but the “Fight Club” director is still in top form with “The Killer.” Based on a French graphic novel series, the film stars Michael Fassbender as a highly experienced professional hitman who’s more than a little burnt out by his profession and ends up flubbing a mission, leading him on an international journey to take out his former employers before they take him out first. The film’s dryly funny sense of humor and Fassbender’s perfectly stoic performance sometimes make it feel like a lark more than a pulsing thriller, but Fincher’s nimble direction and sleekly executed action can still get your heart racing. —WC 11. “The Hateful Eight” Probably Quentin Tarantino’s most divisive film, “The Hateful Eight” polarized critics when it premiered in 2015, with audiences alternatively praising or deriding its script and stage-like setup. But even Tarantino’s worst films are worth watching, and this one remains a fascinating and ambitious work. Set almost entirely in one cabin, the film focuses on a group of eight strangers stranded with one another during a blizzard in post-Civil War Wyoming. All of the characters have their secrets and agendas that raise suspicions throughout the night, and they’re played by a uniformly terrific cast, including Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demián Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Bruce Dern. If you don’t think the original, nearly three-hour cut of the film works, you can check out the extended four-episode limited series version, also available on Netflix. —WC 10. “Woman of the Hour” One of the more impressive directorial debuts from an actor in recent memory, “Woman of the Hour” is an uncommonly smart and empathetic true crime story that’s tightly focused on the way institutions ignore and fail women. Heavily fictionalized, Anna Kendrick’s thriller nonetheless is based on the real 1978 taping of an episode of the syndicated game show “The Dating Game,” where serial killer Rodney Alcala (played by a menacing Daniel Zovatto) won a date with bachelorette Sheryl Bradshaw (Kendrick, whose typical spunky intelligence is used terrifically here). The date didn’t happen in real life — Bradshaw found Alcala creepy and canceled — but it does in the film, and “Woman of the Hour” is consistently suspenseful as it shows all the ways Sheryl and other women are put in danger by a system that doesn’t recognize violence until it’s too late. —WC 9. “Take Shelter” The breakout film of director Jeff Nichols, “Take Shelter” also features a characteristically terrific performance from Michael Shannon as Curtis, a father who lives a happy life with his wife (Jessica Chastain) and daughter in rural Ohio. Their peace is disrupted by visions and dreams Curtis’ begins experiencing of an apocalyptic rain. Paranoid and unwilling to tell his wife about what he’s seen, Curtis instead acts erratically and builds a storm shelter in their backyard, and his behavior soon leads his loved ones to begin to fear him. Nichols’ direction is strong and subtle, but “Take Shelter” really succeeds as a showcase for Shannon, who leaves the audience constantly guessing whether Curtis is protecting his family or what they need to be protected from. —WC 8. “Burning” ‘Burning’Everett Collection / Everett Collection Lee Chang-dong’s acclaimed Korean thriller has a strong literary pedigree, mixing elements of two different short stories both titled “Barn Burning” by writers Haruki Murakami and William Faulkner. But the result is an extraordinary cinematic creation: a nervy, slow-moving, and absorbing look into the relationships between its three main characters, childhood friends Jong-su (Yoo Ah-in) and Hae-Mi (Jong-seo), alongside stranger Ben (Steven Yeun, in a charming but unnerving performance). On the surface, the two are lifelong pals — but a possessive attitude towards Hae-Mi becomes apparent, and Ben clearly hides strange secrets. A deep sense of unease is palpable in every scene and “Burning” keeps that tension growing thicker and thicker, until the final horrifying release that closes the film. —WC 7. “Rebel Ridge” “Rebel Ridge” is the rarest of things: a truly great Netflix Original action thriller. That’s not surprising when it’s coming from Jeremy Saulnier, who has made some of the best recent films in the genre like “Blue Ruin” and “Green Room.” His latest is a tense slow burn set in a small Louisiana town where handsome stranger Terry Richmond (a terrific Aaron Pierre) cycles in one summer day looking to post-bail for his younger cousin. Instead, he’s harassed and hounded after by the town’s corrupt, racist police force, led by the sniveling Sandy Burne (Don Johnson, having a great time). The film’s anti-cop messaging is a refreshing antidote to years of copagada action movies of its ilk, but what makes the movie so good is Saulnier’s careful, immaculate pacing, which builds up the characters and their desperation before the situation boils over into immaculately staged fights. —WC 6. “Marnie” One of Alfred Hitchcock’s most divisive films, “Marnie” is an unsettling psychological thriller about toxic love and mental illness that is either a masterpiece or a campy mess, depending on who you ask. Those willing to buy into the film’s excess will find a truly unforgettable character study of the haunted title character, played with off-kilter frenzy by Tippi Hedren. She’s a mysterious woman with significant trauma from her childhood who attempts to steal from the publishing company of Mark Rutland (Sean Connery, twisting his natural charisma to unpleasant and disturbing ends). When Mark catches her, he’s not interested in turning her in: He’s obsessed with her, and uses the information to blackmail her into marriage. From there, “Marnie” unfurls into a domestic nightmare, as the unhappiness and instability whirling inside Marnie only grow while cloistered within Mark’s family estate. It’s one of Hitchcock’s most difficult works, but one of his most mature as well, a portrait of marital rot that never rests on easy answers about its characters. —WC 5. “Collateral” Rarely have two movie stars been as good in a single film as Tom Cruise and Jamie Fox are in “Collateral.” There’s a lot of things that make Michael Mann’s neo-noir thriller, about a hitman who holds a taxi driver hostage as he goes on a killing spree through Los Angeles, so good, from Mann’s signature slick direction to the tight editing and action. But primarily, it exists as a showcase for the two actors in their prime. Fox is a perfect everyman as the taxi driver, adding a much-needed human perspective to the mayhem. And as the hitman, Tom Cruise cleverly uses the popular perception that he’s inhuman or stiff onscreen to his advantage, playing the remorseless contract killer with a cold, implacable aura. The two are brilliant separated and even more brilliant together, making “Collateral” one of the greatest cat-and-mouse thrillers of its nature. —WC 4. “American Psycho” ‘American Psycho’©Lions Gate/Courtesy Everett Collection A satire so brilliant that many of its biggest fans barely comprehend that it’s satire, Mary Harron’s “American Psycho” is, to many, a quintessential dudebro movie. And yet, Harron — adapting Bret Easton Ellis’ 1991 novel with cowriter Genevieve Turner — is as precise as an arrow in her takedown of hypermasculinity and hyperconsumerist capitalism, embodied by Christian Bale’s uncanny and reptilian portrayal of the self-obsessed serial killer Patrick Bateman. Smug and shallow, Bateman is the type of vapid yuppie common to ’80s New York City, and would be mostly harmless if it weren’t for the fact that he’s also a serial killer — maybe. It’s unclear if Bale’s various bloody misdeeds are real, or figments of his character’s crazed imaginations. It’s up to the audience’s point of view, which is possibly more unnerving. —WC 3. “Psycho” One of the most important films from one of American cinema’s most important directors, “Psycho” is a seminal work of horror and thriller filmmaking. And what’s remarkable about the movie today is how well it holds up, with only a deflating exposition dump toward the end of the feature ever puncturing the thick tension. The iconic shower scene is a staple of horror parodies and will be until the end of time, but it’s still remarkable to watch how it splits the story in two and replaces the slow-burn storyline of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) with the frenetic quest from Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) to cover his tracks. Technically, “Psycho” is a marvel — John L. Russell’s gorgeous black-and-white cinematography and Bernard Herrmann’s chilling score create a movie that feels one-of-a-kind — paving the way for many other films on this list. But it’s hard to surpass Hitchcock’s filmmaking, or Perkins’ unnerving central performance. —WC 2. “Jaws” Not just one of the most popular thrillers of all time but one of the most popular films of all time, “Jaws” practically invented the summer blockbuster when it came out in 1975. But compared to CGI-filled superhero flicks and action franchises, Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of Peter Benchley’s novel feels incredibly small-scale today: a lean, effective story about the hunt for a man-eating shark, one that relies on suspense and atmosphere more than action. Spielberg’s impeccable direction, solid performances from Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss, and that iconic John Williams score all combine to create a white-knuckle thriller that remains engrossing decades later — and will make you think twice before heading to the beach this fall. —WC 1. “Oldboy” ‘Oldboy’Neon Forget Spike Lee’s regrettable American remake if you somehow haven’t already; Park Chan-wook’s original “Oldboy” still thrills over 20 years later. One of the most acclaimed films of its decade, the film tells the propulsive, zig-zagging, and subversive story of Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), an ordinary businessman who is suddenly and abruptly captured and placed in captivity for 15 years. When he’s just as abruptly freed, he goes on a rampage to figure out who was responsible for his torture. Park shoots the hell out of “Oldboy” — that hallway fight scene remains justly influential — but the movie is just as much a deconstruction of the thriller genre than a straight example of the form, examining the depths people can sink to in the pursuit of vengeance. Its horrifying ending is well-known to many, but regardless of whether or not the film can still surprise, its critical look at the futility of revenge remains just as insightful and devastating. —WC",

Paul Feig’s comedic take on the genre is a lightly satirical look at mommy blogging culture and suburban discontent, filtered through the perspective of Anna Kendrick’s dissatisfied Stephanie. When her best friend, the highly successful Emily (Blake Lively) mysteriously disappears, Stephanie throws herself into the investigation and digs up dirt on her seemingly perfect counterpart. If “A Simple Favor” proves a bit wobbly, then Kendrick’s go-for-broke performance and the often genuinely funny script just as frequently steadies the ship. It’s less “Psycho” than it is “Desperate Housewives,” which will be music to anyone who misses “Desperate Housewives.” \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"18-captain-phillips\"\u003e18. “Captain Phillips”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2002\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, Tom Hanks (back left), 2013. ph: Jasin Boland/©Columbia Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg 3000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=280,187 280w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=244,163 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=1160,774 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=142,95 142w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=1200,801 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=505,337 505w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=1011,675 1011w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=225,150 225w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=899,600 899w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=110,73 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=285,190 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=320,214 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=640,427 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDCAPH_EC008.jpg?resize=1280,854 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e‘Captain Phillips’ \u003ccite\u003e©Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePaul Greengrass’ based-on-a-true-story action thriller “Captain Phillips” is handsomely mounted and made, but its primary virtue is as a vehicle for one of star Tom Hanks’ all-time best performances. He plays the title character, captain of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama which was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009. The film harks back to the classic Hanks vehicle “Cast Away,” detailing the innately likable actor’s struggles to survive in desperate circumstances. What elevates it is Greengrass’ muscular direction and the fine acting performances from the entire ensemble. Barkhad Abdi is excellent as pirate leader Abduwali Muse, making the character more than just a villain, but it’s really Hanks’s show, and his moment of anguish in the film’s finale may be the finest acting moment of his entire career. \u003cem\u003e—WC  \u003c/em\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"17-emily-the-criminal\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e17. \u003c/strong\u003e“Emily the Criminal”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1018\" height=\"740\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?w=650\" alt=\"Emily the Criminal, Aubrey Plaza\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png 1018w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=300,218 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=138,100 138w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=600,436 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=257,187 257w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=1000,727 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=244,177 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=131,95 131w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=55,40 55w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=231,168 231w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=464,337 464w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=929,675 929w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=275,200 275w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=550,400 550w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=206,150 206w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=413,300 413w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=825,600 825w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=150,109 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=110,80 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=285,207 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=320,233 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=640,465 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emily-the-Criminal-e1657119818795.png?resize=800,582 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1018px) 100vw, 1018px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e‘Emily the Criminal’ \u003ccite\u003escreenshot\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA nasty crime thriller about how economic uncertainty can push people to desperate extremes, “Emily the Criminal” stars Aubrey Plaza as the titular Emily, a former art student whose college debt and former felony charge prevents her from escaping the drudgeries of service work. When a coworker connects her to a credit card fraud ring, Emily leaps at the opportunity to make some fast cash, and under the tutelage of organizer Youcef (Theo Rossi), she quickly becomes a natural at this very unsavory line of work. The screenplay is occasionally a bit silly, but John Patton Ford’s feature directorial debut shows great promise, and Plaza’s charismatic performance as an ordinary woman with a surprising capacity for violence and crime is damn near flawless. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"16-gerald-s-game\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e16. “Gerald’s Game”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"7360\" height=\"4912\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"\u0026#34;Gerald\u0026#39;s Game\u0026#34;\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg 7360w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=280,187 280w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=244,163 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=1160,774 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=142,95 142w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=1200,801 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=505,337 505w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=1011,675 1011w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=225,150 225w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=899,600 899w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=110,73 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=285,190 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=320,214 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=640,427 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=1280,854 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 7360px) 100vw, 7360px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e‘Gerald’s Game’\u003ccite\u003eNetflix\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStephen King’s chilling tale of bondage sex gone wrong was long thought to be unfilmable, due to so much of the novel “Gerald’s Game” taking place inside the mind of a woman who is chained to her bed.

Antoine Fuqua directs the crime thriller, which casts Gyllenhaal as a police detective demoted to 911 phone operator duty who scrambles alone at his desk during the night shift to help save a caller who claims to have been abducted. For nearly the entire film, Gyllenhaal is the only face on screen, communicating with a parade of voices played by actors like Ethan Hawke, Riley Keough, Eli Goree, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Paul Dano, and Peter Sarsgaard. It works because Gyllenhaal, with his famously expressive eyes and hyper-intense performing style, is precisely the type of actor who’s capable of carrying a thriller like this, and his growing distress makes “The Guilty” the most nerve-wracking way to spend 90 minutes watching a man sitting at a desk. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e \n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"13-missing\"\u003e13. “Missing”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1923\" height=\"1081\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"MISSING, Storm Reid, 2023. © Sony Pictures Entertainment / Courtesy Everett Collection\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg 1923w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=1024,576 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=178,100 178w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=600,337 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=125,70 125w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=660,370 660w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=1000,562 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=244,137 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=1160,652 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=169,95 169w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=71,40 71w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=267,150 267w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=534,300 534w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=1067,600 1067w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=110,62 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=285,160 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=320,180 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=640,360 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MCDMISS_SP004.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1923px) 100vw, 1923px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e‘Missing’\u003ccite\u003e©Sony Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not really a spinoff set of “Searching,” the 2018 screenlife thriller starring John Cho, but it does ostensibly take place in the same universe. And yet, 2023’s “Missing” was a pleasant surprise, a well-directed and well-told standalone mystery that succeeds in entertaining on its own terms. First-time directors Will Merrick and Nick Johnson make great use of the screenlife format to document main character June Allen’s (Storm Reid) desperate quest to track down her missing mother, using the cascading and constant torrent of information as a manifestation of the dead ends and red herrings she has to dig through. Reid is a solid and likable lead, giving the audience a reason to care as the investigation falls quickly out of June’s control. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"12-the-killer\"\u003e12. “The Killer”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2205\" height=\"1275\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"THE KILLER, Michael Fassbender, 2023. © Netflix /Courtesy Everett Collection\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg 2205w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=1024,592 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=1536,888 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=2048,1184 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=173,100 173w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=600,347 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=1000,578 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=244,141 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=1160,671 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=164,95 164w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=69,40 69w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=1200,694 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=291,168 291w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=583,337 583w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=1167,675 1167w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=259,150 259w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=519,300 519w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=1038,600 1038w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=110,64 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=285,165 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=320,185 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=640,370 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=800,463 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=1280,740 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2205px) 100vw, 2205px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e‘The Killer’\u003ccite\u003e©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDavid Fincher’s latest is one of his slightest works, but the “Fight Club” director is still in top form with “The Killer.” Based on a French graphic novel series, the film stars Michael Fassbender as a highly experienced professional hitman who’s more than a little burnt out by his profession and ends up flubbing a mission, leading him on an international journey to take out his former employers before they take him out first.

But even Tarantino’s worst films are worth watching, and this one remains a fascinating and ambitious work. Set almost entirely in one cabin, the film focuses on a group of eight strangers stranded with one another during a blizzard in post-Civil War Wyoming. All of the characters have their secrets and agendas that raise suspicions throughout the night, and they’re played by a uniformly terrific cast, including Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demián Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Bruce Dern. If you don’t think the original, nearly three-hour cut of the film works, you can check out the extended four-episode limited series version, also available on Netflix. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"10-woman-of-the-hour\"\u003e10. “Woman of the Hour” \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"WOMAN OF THE HOUR, Anna Kendrick, 2023. ph: Leah Gallo / © Roadshow Films / Courtesy Everett Collection\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg 3000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=244,163 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=1160,773 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=143,95 143w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=506,337 506w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=1013,675 1013w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=225,150 225w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=110,73 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=285,190 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=320,213 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=640,427 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDWOOF_EC203.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the more impressive directorial debuts from an actor in recent memory, “Woman of the Hour” is an uncommonly smart and empathetic true crime story that’s tightly focused on the way institutions ignore and fail women. Heavily fictionalized, Anna Kendrick’s thriller nonetheless is based on the real 1978 taping of an episode of the syndicated game show “The Dating Game,” where serial killer Rodney Alcala (played by a menacing Daniel Zovatto) won a date with bachelorette Sheryl Bradshaw (Kendrick, whose typical spunky intelligence is used terrifically here). The date didn’t happen in real life — Bradshaw found Alcala creepy and canceled — but it does in the film, and “Woman of the Hour” is consistently suspenseful as it shows all the ways Sheryl and other women are put in danger by a system that doesn’t recognize violence until it’s too late. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"9-take-shelter\"\u003e9. “Take Shelter” \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2116\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/MCDTASH_EC017.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"TAKE SHELTER, Michael Shannon, 2011.

Their peace is disrupted by visions and dreams Curtis’ begins experiencing of an apocalyptic rain. Paranoid and unwilling to tell his wife about what he’s seen, Curtis instead acts erratically and builds a storm shelter in their backyard, and his behavior soon leads his loved ones to begin to fear him. Nichols’ direction is strong and subtle, but “Take Shelter” really succeeds as a showcase for Shannon, who leaves the audience constantly guessing whether Curtis is protecting his family or what they need to be protected from. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"8-burning\"\u003e8. “Burning”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1925\" height=\"1083\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"BURNING, (aka BEONING), JEON Jong-seo, 2018. © Well Go USA / courtesy Everett Collection\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg 1925w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=1024,576 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=178,100 178w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=600,338 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=125,70 125w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=660,370 660w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=244,137 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=1160,653 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=169,95 169w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=71,40 71w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=267,150 267w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=533,300 533w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=1066,600 1066w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=110,62 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=285,160 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=320,180 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=640,360 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MCDBURN_EC048.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1925px) 100vw, 1925px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e‘Burning’\u003ccite\u003eEverett Collection / Everett Collection\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLee Chang-dong’s acclaimed Korean thriller has a strong literary pedigree, mixing elements of two different short stories both titled “Barn Burning” by writers Haruki Murakami and William Faulkner. But the result is an extraordinary cinematic creation: a nervy, slow-moving, and absorbing look into the relationships between its three main characters, childhood friends Jong-su (Yoo Ah-in) and Hae-Mi (Jong-seo), alongside stranger Ben (Steven Yeun, in a charming but unnerving performance). On the surface, the two are lifelong pals — but a possessive attitude towards Hae-Mi becomes apparent, and Ben clearly hides strange secrets. A deep sense of unease is palpable in every scene and “Burning” keeps that tension growing thicker and thicker, until the final horrifying release that closes the film. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"7-rebel-ridge\"\u003e7. “Rebel Ridge”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"REBEL RIDGE, Aaron Pierre, 2024. ph: Allyson Riggs  / © Netflix / Courtesy Everett Collection\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg 3000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=244,163 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=1160,773 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=143,95 143w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=506,337 506w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=1013,675 1013w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=225,150 225w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=110,73 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=285,190 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=320,213 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=640,427 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Rebel Ridge” is the rarest of things: a truly great Netflix Original action thriller. That’s not surprising when it’s coming from Jeremy Saulnier, who has made some of the best recent films in the genre like “Blue Ruin” and “Green Room.” His latest is a tense slow burn set in a small Louisiana town where handsome stranger Terry Richmond (a terrific Aaron Pierre) cycles in one summer day looking to post-bail for his younger cousin. Instead, he’s harassed and hounded after by the town’s corrupt, racist police force, led by the sniveling Sandy Burne (Don Johnson, having a great time). The film’s anti-cop messaging is a refreshing antidote to years of copagada action movies of its ilk, but what makes the movie so good is Saulnier’s careful, immaculate pacing, which builds up the characters and their desperation before the situation boils over into immaculately staged fights. \u003cem\u003e—WC \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"6-marnie\"\u003e6. “Marnie” \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2324\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"MARNIE, Tippi Hedren, Sean Connery, 1964\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg 3000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=300,232 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=1024,793 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=1536,1190 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=2048,1587 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=129,100 129w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=600,465 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=241,187 241w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=1000,775 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=244,189 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=1160,899 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=123,95 123w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=52,40 52w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=1200,930 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=290,225 290w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=581,450 581w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=1162,900 1162w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=217,168 217w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=435,337 435w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=871,675 871w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=258,200 258w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=516,400 516w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=1033,800 1033w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=194,150 194w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=387,300 387w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=775,600 775w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=1936,1500 1936w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=70,53 70w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=150,116 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=110,85 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=285,221 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=310,240 310w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=320,248 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=620,480 620w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=640,496 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=800,620 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=991,768 991w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MCDMARN_EC001.jpg?resize=1280,992 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of Alfred Hitchcock’s most divisive films, “Marnie” is an unsettling psychological thriller about toxic love and mental illness that is either a masterpiece or a campy mess, depending on who you ask. Those willing to buy into the film’s excess will find a truly unforgettable character study of the haunted title character, played with off-kilter frenzy by Tippi Hedren. She’s a mysterious woman with significant trauma from her childhood who attempts to steal from the publishing company of Mark Rutland (Sean Connery, twisting his natural charisma to unpleasant and disturbing ends). When Mark catches her, he’s not interested in turning her in: He’s obsessed with her, and uses the information to blackmail her into marriage. From there, “Marnie” unfurls into a domestic nightmare, as the unhappiness and instability whirling inside Marnie only grow while cloistered within Mark’s family estate. It’s one of Hitchcock’s most difficult works, but one of his most mature as well, a portrait of marital rot that never rests on easy answers about its characters. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"5-collateral\"\u003e5. “Collateral”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2550\" height=\"1695\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"COLLATERAL, Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, 2004, (c) DreamWorks/courtesy Everett Collection\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg 2550w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=1024,681 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=1536,1021 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=2048,1361 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=600,399 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=1000,665 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=244,162 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=1160,771 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=143,95 143w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=1200,798 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=253,168 253w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=507,337 507w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=1015,675 1015w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=226,150 226w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=451,300 451w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=903,600 903w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=110,73 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=285,189 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=320,213 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=640,425 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=800,532 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDCOLL_EC002.jpg?resize=1280,851 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2550px) 100vw, 2550px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRarely have two movie stars been as good in a single film as Tom Cruise and Jamie Fox are in “Collateral.” There’s a lot of things that make Michael Mann’s neo-noir thriller, about a hitman who holds a taxi driver hostage as he goes on a killing spree through Los Angeles, so good, from Mann’s signature slick direction to the tight editing and action. But primarily, it exists as a showcase for the two actors in their prime. Fox is a perfect everyman as the taxi driver, adding a much-needed human perspective to the mayhem. And as the hitman, Tom Cruise cleverly uses the popular perception that he’s inhuman or stiff onscreen to his advantage, playing the remorseless contract killer with a cold, implacable aura. The two are brilliant separated and even more brilliant together, making “Collateral” one of the greatest cat-and-mouse thrillers of its nature. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"4-american-psycho\"\u003e4. “American Psycho”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1221\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"AMERICAN PSYCHO, Christian Bale, 2000. © Lions Gate / Courtesy Everett Collection\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg 1920w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=300,191 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=1024,651 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=1536,977 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=157,100 157w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=600,382 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=294,187 294w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=1000,636 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=244,155 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=1160,738 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=149,95 149w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=63,40 63w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=1200,763 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=264,168 264w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=530,337 530w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=1061,675 1061w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=236,150 236w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=472,300 472w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=943,600 943w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=110,70 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=285,181 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=320,204 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=640,407 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=800,509 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MCDAMPS_LG003.jpg?resize=1280,814 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e‘American Psycho’\u003ccite\u003e©Lions Gate/Courtesy Everett Collection\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA satire so brilliant that many of its biggest fans barely comprehend that it’s satire, Mary Harron’s “American Psycho” is, to many, a quintessential dudebro movie. And yet, Harron — adapting Bret Easton Ellis’ 1991 novel with cowriter Genevieve Turner — is as precise as an arrow in her takedown of hypermasculinity and hyperconsumerist capitalism, embodied by Christian Bale’s uncanny and reptilian portrayal of the self-obsessed serial killer Patrick Bateman. Smug and shallow, Bateman is the type of vapid yuppie common to ’80s New York City, and would be mostly harmless if it weren’t for the fact that he’s also a serial killer — maybe. It’s unclear if Bale’s various bloody misdeeds are real, or figments of his character’s crazed imaginations. It’s up to the audience’s point of view, which is possibly more unnerving. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"3-psycho\"\u003e3. “Psycho” \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2207\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"PSYCHO, Anthony Perkins, 1960\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg 3000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=300,221 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=1024,753 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=1536,1130 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=2048,1507 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=136,100 136w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=600,441 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=254,187 254w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=1000,736 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=244,180 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=1160,853 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=129,95 129w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=54,40 54w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=1200,883 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=228,168 228w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=458,337 458w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=918,675 918w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=272,200 272w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=544,400 544w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=1087,800 1087w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=204,150 204w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=408,300 408w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=816,600 816w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=2039,1500 2039w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=110,81 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=285,210 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=320,235 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=640,471 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=800,589 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MBDPSYC_EC046.jpg?resize=1280,942 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most important films from one of American cinema’s most important directors, “Psycho” is a seminal work of horror and thriller filmmaking. And what’s remarkable about the movie today is how well it holds up, with only a deflating exposition dump toward the end of the feature ever puncturing the thick tension. The iconic shower scene is a staple of horror parodies and will be until the end of time, but it’s still remarkable to watch how it splits the story in two and replaces the slow-burn storyline of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) with the frenetic quest from Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) to cover his tracks. Technically, “Psycho” is a marvel — John L. Russell’s gorgeous black-and-white cinematography and Bernard Herrmann’s chilling score create a movie that feels one-of-a-kind — paving the way for many other films on this list. But it’s hard to surpass Hitchcock’s filmmaking, or Perkins’ unnerving central performance. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"2-jaws\"\u003e2. “Jaws”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2320\" height=\"1605\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"JAWS, Susan Backlinie, 1975\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg 2320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=300,208 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=1024,708 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=1536,1063 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=2048,1417 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=145,100 145w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=600,415 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=270,187 270w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=1000,692 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=244,169 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=1160,803 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=137,95 137w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=58,40 58w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=1200,830 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=243,168 243w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=487,337 487w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=976,675 976w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=289,200 289w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=578,400 578w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=1156,800 1156w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=217,150 217w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=434,300 434w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=867,600 867w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=110,76 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=285,197 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=320,221 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=640,443 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=800,553 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MSDJAWS_EC002.jpg?resize=1280,886 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2320px) 100vw, 2320px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNot just one of the most popular thrillers of all time but one of the most popular films of all time, “Jaws” practically invented the summer blockbuster when it came out in 1975. But compared to CGI-filled superhero flicks and action franchises, Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of Peter Benchley’s novel feels incredibly small-scale today: a lean, effective story about the hunt for a man-eating shark, one that relies on suspense and atmosphere more than action. Spielberg’s impeccable direction, solid performances from Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss, and that iconic John Williams score all combine to create a white-knuckle thriller that remains engrossing decades later — and will make you think twice before heading to the beach this fall. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"1-oldboy\"\u003e1. “Oldboy”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"3840\" height=\"1638\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?w=650\" alt=\"Oldboy 20th anniversary restoration\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg 3840w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=300,128 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=1024,437 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=1536,655 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=2048,874 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=234,100 234w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=600,256 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=1000,427 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=244,104 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=1160,495 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=223,95 223w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=94,40 94w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=1200,512 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=150,64 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=110,47 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=285,122 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=320,137 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=640,273 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=800,341 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still6.jpeg?resize=1280,546 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e‘Oldboy’\u003ccite\u003eNeon\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eForget Spike Lee’s regrettable American remake if you somehow haven’t already; Park Chan-wook’s original “Oldboy” still thrills over 20 years later. One of the most acclaimed films of its decade, the film tells the propulsive, zig-zagging, and subversive story of Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), an ordinary businessman who is suddenly and abruptly captured and placed in captivity for 15 years. When he’s just as abruptly freed, he goes on a rampage to figure out who was responsible for his torture. Park shoots the hell out of “Oldboy” — that hallway fight scene remains justly influential — but the movie is just as much a deconstruction of the thriller genre than a straight example of the form, examining the depths people can sink to in the pursuit of vengeance. Its horrifying ending is well-known to many, but regardless of whether or not the film can still surprise, its critical look at the futility of revenge remains just as insightful and devastating. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
