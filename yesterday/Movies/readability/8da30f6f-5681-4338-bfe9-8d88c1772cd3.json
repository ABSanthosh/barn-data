  "text": "Liz Plank has recently clarified whether she had commented on Justin Baldoni’s latest lawsuit update or not. She was his Man Enough podcast co-host until her departure in December 2024. Baldoni’s $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively was recently dismissed by the court, as it was discovered that her allegations of sexual harassment were legally protected. Moreover, his $250 million lawsuit against The New York Times was also dismissed. So, did Plank comment on Baldoni’s lawsuit update? Here’s everything to know. The acclaimed journalist had uploaded a social media post related to her new podcast series, Boy Problems. In the Instagram post, Liz Plank asked fans to send her and Katie Couric their “boy problems” for an upcoming episode. One fan commented under the post, “I just saw the funniest boy problem get dismissed by a federal judge in New York lol.” This comment referenced her former Man Enough podcast co-host Justin Baldoni’s $400 million lawsuit dismissal. Plank liked the comment and responded, “lmfaooo.” Following this, the Daily Mail published an article claiming that Plank’s comment was a brutal jab at Baldoni’s legal woes. Shortly after this, she uploaded a story on Instagram. In it, she clarified what she had reacted to and called out the media outlet for their article. “This story is fake,” Plank wrote. She shared that she had responded to the fan’s comment under the assumption that it was about President Donald Trump, whom she said was “actively dismantling democracy.” Plank noted that this was “the boy problem” she thought of “daily.” The veteran media personality then pointed out how every time someone made a conspiracy theory about her, she got “death threats” or was “doxed.” “Shame on the Daily Mail for printing this trash for clicks, go touch grass,” she added. (via Buzzfeed) Liz Plank departed Justin Baldoni’s Man Enough podcast in December 2024, shortly after Blake Lively levied sexual harassment allegations against him. She confirmed her departure via Instagram, expressing gratitude towards fans for their support. Plank also promised to share more details surrounding her departure soon. She also said that she would continue supporting those calling out “injustice” and holding “people standing in their way accountable.”",
