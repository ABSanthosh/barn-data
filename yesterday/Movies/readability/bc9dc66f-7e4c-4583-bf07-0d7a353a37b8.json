  "description": "\"Captures a street-level realism.\" Utopia has unveiled an official trailer for a grainy, experimental indie film creation called Pet Shop Days, marking the feature directorial debut of young filmmaker / producer Olmo Schnabel. Yes he just so happens to be artist / filmmaker Julian Schnabel's son. This premiered at the 2023 Venice Film Festival, and it also played at SXSW \u0026 Santa Barbara last year, and is finally being released in NY \u0026 LA cinemas this March. For anyone intrigued. Impulsive black sheep Alejandro and pet store worker Jack, enter a whirlwind romance that sends them deep down the rabbit hole of depravity in Manhattan's underworld. It's executive produced \u0026 presented by Martin Scorsese, Michel Franco and Jeremy O. Harris, starring Jack Irv \u0026 Dario Yazbek Bernal, alongside Willem Dafoe, Peter Sarsgaard, Emmanuelle Seigner, and more. This is sort of an NYC drama, sort of an old school vibe film, and sort of just a strange crime thriller. Seems like it's trying too hard to be something unique when it just looks derivative \u0026 boring.

Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Olmo Schnabel's film Pet Shop Days, from Utopia's YouTube: In an act of desperation, impulsive black sheep Alejandro flees his home in Mexico... On the run from his unforgiving father, Alejandro finds himself in New York City where he meets Jack, a college age pet store employee with similar parental baggage. Together they enter a whirlwind romance sending them down the rabbit hole of drugs \u0026 depravity in Manhattan's underworld. When Alejandro’s past threatens to catch up with him, Jack is forced to choose between his family and a life on the run. Pet Shop Days is directed by American producer / filmmaker Olmo Schnabel, now making his feature directorial debut after producing other indie films (including this year's Lurker). The screenplay is co-written by Jack Irv, Galen Core, and Olmo Schnabel. Produced by Alex Coco, Galen Core, Francesco Melzi d'Eril, Gabriele Moratti, Marie Savare, and Schnabel. This initially premiered at the 2023 Venice Film Festival a few years back. Utopia will release Schnabel's Pet Shop Days in select US theaters starting March 15th, 2025 coming soon. Anyone curious?
