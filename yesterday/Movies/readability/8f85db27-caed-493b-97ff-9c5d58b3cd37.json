  "description": "\"He's a monster who creates monsters.\" Dark Star Pictures has revealed the US trailer for a totally bonkers action comedy from France titled Zénithal, made by genre filmmaker Jean-Baptiste Saurel.

Will this be as absurdly fun as it looks? Who knows. Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Jean-Baptiste Saurel's film Zénithal, direct from YouTube: \"Men who doubt, women who fight – a couple that grows.\" Ti-Kong, the famous Kung-fu master, is found dead. Could the assassin be the Machiavellian doctor Sweeper? Insecure Francis falls into his clutches as he becomes a crucial part of Sweeper’s scheme to preserve absolute male domination over the globe. That is unless Sonia, his girlfriend, decides to take action to save him, restore their relationship, and establish peace between the sexes. Zénithal is directed by French indie filmmaker Jean-Baptiste Saurel, making his feature directorial debut with this after other short films previously; he also directed the \"Zorro\" series from last year. The screenplay is written by Jean-Baptiste Saurel and Elodie Wallace. Produced by Amaury Ovise. This first premiered at Fantastic Fest 2024 in Austin, TX last fall. Dark Star will debut Zénithal in select US theaters on May 30th, 2025, then on VOD in the US starting July 1st. Anyone want to watch it?
