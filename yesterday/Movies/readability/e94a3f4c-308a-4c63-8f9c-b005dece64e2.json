  "text": "Walter Salles’ political drama “I’m Still Here” swept top honors at the 12th edition of the Premios Platino, Ibero-America’s most prominent awards event. The Brazilian drama, winner of the Best International Feature Film Oscar this year, took home prizes for Best Iberoamerican Feature, Director for Salles and Actress for its Oscar-nominated lead, Fernanda Torres, at the glittering event held in Madrid. On the television side, Netflix’s ambitious Colombian series “100 Years of Solitude” beat out another equally large-scale Netflix series, Brazil’s “Senna,” as well as O2 Filmes’ “City of God: The Fight Rages On” and Endemol Shine Boomdog-HBO Max’s lush “Like Water for Chocolate.” Popular on Variety “100 Years of Solitude” director Alex Garcia Lopez thanked Netflix VP of Content Paco Ramos and the company “for having the vision, the guts, the crazy idea of buying the rights to this book and giving all of us the opportunity to bring Gabo’s [Nobel Laureate author Gabriel García Márquez] words to life.” “I also want to thank the García family, especially the great filmmaker Rodrigo García, who accompanied us throughout the whole process, and Laura Mora, the other great Colombian director who leads the series,” he added. Its lead, Claudio Cataño, who won Best Actor in a Series, thanked the cast and crew and paid tribute to his late grandmother, who had reared him. Colombian “Modern Family” star Sofia Vergara made a surprise appearance to give multi-hyphenate Eva Longoria her Premio Platino Honorary Award, and had Longoria in stitches when she exclaimed: “I came to Hollywood wanting to be Eva Longoria, and she’s younger than me.” Apologizing for her imperfect Spanish, the Texas-born actress, director, producer and activist said: “I’ve had the dream of proudly representing my roots and honoring, in particular, Hispanic women. It’s because I believe that when you help a woman bring out the great potential she carries inside, something truly powerful comes out. And now, seeing this incredible group of talent makes me feel very honored, but even more so, very proud to see how great you all are, and how powerful we are together. Because Hispanics are always something more — we work harder, we’re more passionate, we’re more human. We’re good people.” In a press conference held the day before, Longoria revealed that she was developing a musical and was seeking Latino actors and dancers. Her UnbeliEVAble Entertainment is a co-producer of “Land of Women,” which earned Spain’s Carmen Maura (“Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown”) her Best Supporting Actress in a Series prize. Meanwhile, Spanish composer Alberto Iglesias, a frequent collaborator of Pedro Almodovar, won his sixth Premio Platino, for his original score in Almodóvar’s first English-language feature “The Room Next Door.” Tatiana Huezo, the first Mexican to win the Best Documentary Platino honor for her doc, “The Echo,” dedicated her prize to the peasant children of “The Echo” and of Mexico. Spanish suspense drama “La Infiltrada,” the true story of Aranzazu Berradre Marín, a National Police agent who infiltrated Basque terrorist group ETA at 20 and risked everything to dismantle the Donosti command during ETA’s false ceasefire, was recognized for its screenplay and editing. In a poignant moment during the ceremony, Argentina’s Daniel Fanego, who died last year, posthumously won for his Supporting Role in Rei Pictures’ “Kill the Jockey.” Next year’s Premios Platino will be held at Xcaret, in the Riviera Maya, Mexico.
