  "text": "The South East European Film Festival in Los Angeles has wrapped its 20th edition with the presentation of jury and audience awards. DJ Ahmet, directed by North Macedonian filmmaker Georgi M. Unkovski, won SEEfest‘s Grand Jury Prize for Best Feature Film. “A lyrical coming of age story set in a Yuruk village in North Macedonia – manages to be both deeply relatable and rapturously original,” wrote the jury, comprised of Tessa Blake, Robert Bailey, and Marlis Pujol. “With beautiful and evocative cinematography and nuanced storytelling, Georgi M. Unkovski (writer/director) captures the universal pain of a young man trying to find his place in the world. Utilizing the deeply specific details of the setting, Unkovski creates a rich and complex experience, saturating us in Ahmet’s point of view. The performances are gorgeous allowing the film to envelop the audience in its humanist grace.” ‘DJ Ahmet’ Films Boutique DJ Ahmet, starring Arif Jakup, Agush Agushev, and Aksel Mehme, also won the Audience Award at SEEfest, and the Cinema Without Borders’ “Bridging the Borders” award, sponsored by 360 MEDIA. That adds to an impressive list of wins for the drama, which premiered at Sundance in January, where it earned a Special Jury Award for Creative Vision, as well as the Audience Award. It also won Best Feature Film at the recent Desertscape International Film Festival in Southern Utah. Watch on Deadline The SEEfest jury prize comes with a cash award furnished by Montage Media. “Congratulations on your film winning SEEfest 2025!” Montage Media President E’Ian West said in a statement. “Your storytelling and execution clearly reflect the time, dedication, and passion you poured into this project. We are truly inspired by your work and eagerly look forward to your next artistic endeavor. As a token of our support, Montage Media Production Company will be awarding you a cash prize when you enter pre-production on your next project. Here’s to more powerful stories ahead!” ‘The New Year That Never Came’ Kinotopia SEEfest’s Best Ensemble Award went to The New Year That Never Came, directed by Bogdan Mureșanu. “A brilliantly rendered tragicomedy, The New Year That Never Came creates a vivid kaleidoscope of humanity through overlapping stories on the eve of the Romanian revolution,” jurors wrote. “Capturing the quiet insanity of living in a dictatorship, writer/director Bogdan Mureșanu saturates his story in the details of rage and fear. The actors bring extraordinary depth and nuance to every moment. It’s a gorgeous film with a remarkable ensemble of performers.” Scroll for the complete list of SEEfest winners. ‘At the Door of the House, Who Will Come Knocking’ Lightdox In the nonfiction film categories, At the Door of the House, Who Will Come Knocking, directed and shot by Maja Novaković, won two prizes, including Best Documentary Film. “How can a film with hardly any plot or dialogue grab you by the lapels and not let go? See this film and find out!” wrote the jury comprised of Sarah Anthony and Gabi Hayes. “An old man and his horse share an intense bond as they survive the cold and lonely winter in the snowy Bosnian countryside. Each exquisite frame is like a painting. We’re still thinking about it weeks later. It was our favorite film.” Maja Novaković’s film also won Best Cinematography In A Documentary Film. The jury in that category, made up of Ivan Cordeiro, Mark Hayes, and Denny Dugally, wrote, “In At The Door Of The House Who Will Come Knocking, isolation is skillfully portrayed through an atmospheric setting, giving the story a captivating, dreamlike quality reminiscent of a folktale. The narrative unfolds and evolves over time, steadily peeling away psychological layers and adding depth through creative additions. Director Maja Novakovic strikes a balance between restraint and gentle nudging, allowing the story to breathe while occasionally adding subtle touches to coax it forward. Her very intimate use of the camera added by a relentless patience gives the film a meditational feeling that ultimately works beyond mere and vain life philosophy.” Tennis great Ilie Nastase gestures toward an umpire in ‘Nasty’ Libra Films The Audience Award in the feature documentary category was claimed by Nasty, “The story of 1970s tennis legend Ilie Nastase, the sport’s first rebel rockstar.” The documentary, which screened at Cannes last year, is directed by a trio of filmmakers (who, like Nastase himself, are Romanian): Tudor Giurgiu, Cristian Pascariu, and Tudor D. Popescu. SEEfest, founded in 2006 by film critic and cultural entrepreneur Vera Mijojlić, is co-presented by ELMA — foundation for European Languages and Movies in America. The 20th anniversary edition of the event – showcasing films in competition come from 20 countries of South and Eastern Europe — ran from April 30 to May 7. Serving as the SEEfest’s honorary chair was Bulgarian American actress and singer Irina Maleeva. SEEfest These are the 2025 SEEfest prize winners: BEST FEATURE FILM, GRAND JURY PRIZE  DJ AHMET Director: Georgi M. Unkovski North Macedonia, Czech Republic, Serbia, Croatia Jury: Tessa Blake, Robert Bailey, Marlis Pujol Jury Statement: DJ AHMET – a lyrical coming of age story set in a Yuruk village in North Macedonia – manages to be both deeply relatable and rapturously original. With beautiful and evocative cinematography and nuanced storytelling, Georgi M. Unkovski (writer/director) captures the universal pain of a young man trying to find his place in the world. Utilizing the deeply specific details of the setting, Unkovski creates a rich and complex experience, saturating us in Ahmet’s point of view. The performances are gorgeous allowing the film to envelop the audience in its humanist grace.  The award comes with a cash prize from Montage Media (montagemediausa.com) whose president, E’Ian West said in a statement: ‘Congratulationson your film winning SEEfest 2025! Your storytelling and execution clearly reflect the time, dedication, and passion you poured into this project. We are truly inspired by your work and eagerly look forward to your next artistic endeavor. As a token of our support, Montage Media Production Company will be awarding you a cash prize when you enter pre-production on your next project. Here’s to more powerful stories ahead!’  BEST ENSEMBLE THE NEW YEAR THAT NEVER CAME Director: Bogdan Mureșanu Romania-Serbia  Jury: Tessa Blake, Robert Bailey, Marlis Pujol Jury Statement: A brilliantly rendered tragicomedy, THE NEW YEAR THAT NEVER CAME creates a vivid kaleidoscope of humanity through overlapping stories on the eve of the Romanian revolution. Capturing the quiet insanity of living in a dictatorship, writer/director Bogdan Mureșanu saturates his story in the details of rage and fear. The actors bring extraordinary depth and nuance to every moment. It’s a gorgeous film with a remarkable ensemble of performers.  BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY IN A FEATURE FILM SUPERMARKET Director: Nemanja Bečanović Cinematographer: Dusan Grubin Montenegro Jury: Dennis Flippin, Valentina Caniglia, Jihane Mrad Balaa Jury Statement: SUPERMARKET delivers a visual experience that transcends its simple setting. The cinematography transforms fluorescent sterility into a living, breathing landscape of human emotion. Every frame feels intentional; the lighting nuances between harsh reality and fleeting dreams, creating a rhythm that mirrors the protagonist’s fragile grip on hope. The camera doesn’t just observe but it immerses and that’s why we feel drawn into corners of loneliness, unexpected beauty, and silent rebellion. It’s rare to find imagery so deeply wedded to a character’s soul. In SUPERMARKET, the cinematography leans heavily into contrast: cold aisles lit with clinical precision dissolve into pockets of warmth. This seamless dance is why its visual language deserves to be celebrated. BEST DOCUMENTARY FILM AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE WHO WILL COME KNOCKING Director: Maja Novaković Serbia Jury: Sarah Anthony, Gabi Hayes Jury Statement: How can a film with hardly any plot or dialogue grab you by the lapels and not let go? See this film and find out! An old man and his horse share an intense bond as they survive the cold and lonely winter in the snowy Bosnian countryside. Each exquisite frame is like a painting. We’re still thinking about it weeks later. It was our favorite film.  BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY IN A DOCUMENTARY FILM AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE WHO WILL COME KNOCKING Director/Cinematographer: Maja Novaković Serbia Jury: Ivan Cordeiro, Mark Hayes, Denny Dugally Jury Statement: In AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE WHO WILL COME KNOCKING, isolation is skillfully portrayed through an atmospheric setting, giving the story a captivating, dreamlike quality reminiscent of a folktale. The narrative unfolds and evolves over time, steadily peeling away psychological layers and adding depth through creative additions. Director Maja Novakovic strikes a balance between restraint and gentle nudging, allowing the story to breathe while occasionally adding subtle touches to coax it forward. Her very intimate use of the camera added by a relentless patience gives the film a meditational feeling that ultimately works beyond mere and vain life philosophy. BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY IN A DOCUMENTARY FILM – HONORABLE MENTIONSOIL AND WINGS Serbia Director/Cinematographer: Stefan Malešević Jury Statement: The film’s cinematographic style is characterized by serene panoramic shots that capture the tranquil lifestyle of his subjects, setting the tone for introspective storytelling. SOIL AND WINGS is further enhanced by very thoughtful editing, creating a meditative pace that immerses the viewer in the world of the storytellers. The shots create a hypnotic experience, especially in its ending sequence. BEST SHORT FICTION: CHOICE N. Macedonia Director: Marko Crnogorski Jury: Leo Behrens, Michael Cory Davis, Brenna Malloy Jury Statement: Choice grips the viewer from its very first frame, launching into a frenetic visual style that mirrors the internal chaos of its lead character. The use of rapid, disorienting camera movements and urgent pacing — all motivated by the experience of the protagonist — creates a visceral sense of unease, pulling the audience directly into her emotional state. Without offering a detailed backstory for the character’s decision to seek an abortion, the film instead forces the viewer to confront a deeper question: Do we, as a society, have the right to define the legitimacy of someone’s personal reasoning — or should it always be her choice?The lead performance is raw and compelling, anchoring the chaos with a powerful emotional core. The narrative, though minimal, resonates through its intensity and restraint. Choice doesn’t moralize or provide easy answers; instead, it challenges viewers to examine their own beliefs through the lens of empathy and urgency.By the end, the film leaves a lasting impression — not only as a commentary on reproductive rights but as a human story of autonomy and compassion, and the lengths some women must go to preserve their own free will. It’s a bold, affecting piece that keeps its audience on emotional edge from start to finish. BEST SHORT FICTION – HONORABLE MENTION APARTMENT 2A Slovenia Director: Gaja Möderndorfer BEST SHORT DOCUMENTARY FILM ZASTAVA BROTHERS Director: Pep Stojanovic USA Jury: Lori Nelson, Todd Thompson, Jonathan Berman Jury Statement: In the 1980’s the Zastava Yugo, aka the Yugo, was sold in the US for less than $4000, bringing both popularity and derision. The film focuses on “superfans” of the car, immigrants to the U.S. who hail from disparate corners of the former Yugoslavian Republic, who transcend politics and bond via their love of the vehicle. The jury found this affectionate film a breath of fresh air, delivering a peppy subtext of adventure, unity, joy for the Yugo’s fans and their families. Spanning continents and generations, this tradition pays fond childhood memories forward, creating new bonds and bringing families together — all through a shared love of automobiles. BEST SHORT ANIMATION – 2D HURIKAN Czech Republic Director: Jan Saska Jury: Omandi Moore, Rachel Lewis, Peter Jayne Jury Statement: HURIKAN perfectly leverages the strengths of animation in storytelling. Through technical expertise, deft pacing, and timing, HURIKAN manages to pull us into its world immediately.  Although strange, anachronistic, and exaggerated, this world still seems to reflect the same daily problems that all people endure. With perfect comic timing and stunning character animation. HURIKAN shows us that no matter how big or small our problems are, good fortune may lie just one bad decision beyond our reach.  This hilarious odyssey of a parched protagonist reminds us that sometimes our relative sacrifices for the greater good can be tempered by small mercies along the way. BEST SHORT ANIMATION – 3D MILES AND FLOWERS Ukraine  Director: Danny Volosozhar Jury: Omandi Moore, Rachel Lewis, Peter Jayne Jury Statement: MILES AND FLOWERS instantly conveys the heart-wrenching realities of war and specifically Ukraine’s current struggle. Through deceptively innocuous caricature, the viewer immediately identifies with the travelers as they navigate a decimated city. The adept use of 3D’s ability to manipulate light and atmosphere makes the character’s dread and hope palpable and even more poignant.  MILES AND FLOWERS’ great achievement is its ability to evoke empathy, no matter how removed the viewer may be from real-time events. BEST SHORT ANIMATION – STOP MOTION FAMILY PORTRAIT Croatia Director: Lea Vidakovic Jury: Omandi Moore, Rachel Lewis, Peter Jayne Jury Statement: FAMILY PORTRAIT is a beautiful, haunting, and at times, grotesque representation of family in the midst of loss and grief. With exquisite attention to detail, FAMILY PORTRAIT expertly uses stop-motion’s surreal nature to reveal the discord that arises from the collision of each family member’s coping methods. Through amazing craftsmanship and technique, the invisible heartache becomes the main character in this all-too-familiar tale.  Audience Awards Feature Film: DJ AHMET, a shepherd’s boy tale of music, first love and dance in a rural Macedonian village, directed by SEEfest alum Georgi M. Unkovski, N. Macedonia.  Documentary Film: NASTY, The story of 1970s tennis legend Ilie Nastase, the sport’s first rebel rockstar was directed by a trio of Romanians: Tudor Giurgiu, Cristian Pascariu and Tudor D. Popescu.   Other Awards:  The winner of the Cinema Without Borders’ Bridging the Borders award, sponsored by 360 MEDIA, is DJ AHMET, Georgi M.

The cinematography transforms fluorescent sterility into a living, breathing landscape of human emotion. Every frame feels intentional; the lighting nuances between harsh reality and fleeting dreams, creating a rhythm that mirrors the protagonist’s fragile grip on hope. The camera doesn’t just observe but it immerses and that’s why we feel drawn into corners of loneliness, unexpected beauty, and silent rebellion. It’s rare to find imagery so deeply wedded to a character’s soul. In SUPERMARKET, the cinematography leans heavily into contrast: cold aisles lit with clinical precision dissolve into pockets of warmth. This seamless dance is why its visual language deserves to be celebrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eBEST DOCUMENTARY FILM\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eAT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE WHO WILL COME KNOCKING\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tDirector: Maja Novaković\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tSerbia\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tJury: Sarah Anthony, Gabi Hayes\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tJury Statement: How can a film with hardly any plot or dialogue grab you by the lapels and not let go?

The narrative unfolds and evolves over time, steadily peeling away psychological layers and adding depth through creative additions. Director Maja Novakovic strikes a balance between restraint and gentle nudging, allowing the story to breathe while occasionally adding subtle touches to coax it forward.

The film focuses on “superfans” of the car, immigrants to the U.S. who hail from disparate corners of the former Yugoslavian Republic, who transcend politics and bond via their love of the vehicle. The jury found this affectionate film a breath of fresh air, delivering a peppy subtext of adventure, unity, joy for the Yugo’s fans and their families. Spanning continents and generations, this tradition pays fond childhood memories forward, creating new bonds and bringing families together — all through a shared love of automobiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eBEST SHORT ANIMATION – 2D\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eHURIKAN\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eCzech Republic\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tDirector: Jan Saska\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tJury: Omandi Moore, Rachel Lewis, Peter Jayne\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tJury Statement: HURIKAN perfectly leverages the strengths of animation in storytelling.

HURIKAN shows us that no matter how big or small our problems are, good fortune may lie just one bad decision beyond our reach.  This hilarious odyssey of a parched protagonist reminds us that sometimes our relative sacrifices for the greater good can be tempered by small mercies along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eBEST SHORT ANIMATION – 3D\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eMILES AND FLOWERS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eUkraine \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tDirector: Danny Volosozhar\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tJury: Omandi Moore, Rachel Lewis, Peter Jayne\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tJury Statement: MILES AND FLOWERS instantly conveys the heart-wrenching realities of war and specifically Ukraine’s current struggle. Through deceptively innocuous caricature, the viewer immediately identifies with the travelers as they navigate a decimated city. The adept use of 3D’s ability to manipulate light and atmosphere makes the character’s dread and hope palpable and even more poignant.  MILES AND FLOWERS’ great achievement is its ability to evoke empathy, no matter how removed the viewer may be from real-time events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eBEST SHORT ANIMATION – STOP MOTION\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eFAMILY PORTRAIT\u003c/strong\u003e\n\n\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eCroatia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tDirector: Lea Vidakovic\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tJury: Omandi Moore, Rachel Lewis, Peter Jayne\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tJury Statement: FAMILY PORTRAIT is a beautiful, haunting, and at times, grotesque representation of family in the midst of loss and grief. With exquisite attention to detail, FAMILY PORTRAIT expertly uses stop-motion’s surreal nature to reveal the discord that arises from the collision of each family member’s coping methods. Through amazing craftsmanship and technique, the invisible heartache becomes the main character in this all-too-familiar tale. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eAudience Awards\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eFeature Film\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003cstrong\u003eDJ AHMET\u003c/strong\u003e, a shepherd’s boy tale of music, first love and dance in a rural Macedonian village, directed by SEEfest alum Georgi M.
