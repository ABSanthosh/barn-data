It'll be streaming on Netflix worldwide later in July this summer. A must see for anyone who wants a glimpse into the utter insanity of right wing worldwide politics these days. Watch for it. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Petra Costa's doc Apocalypse in the Tropics, from YouTube: When does a democracy end, and a theocracy begin? Apocalypse in the Tropics takes us on a decade-long journey through the spiritual and political upheaval of Brazil. What begins as a search for signs of life in a fragile democracy transforms into a deeper inquiry into the seductions of power, prophecy, belief. Costa gains extraordinary access to President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, former President Jair Bolsonaro and the nation's magnetic televangelist Silas Malafaia. More than a chronicle of political change, Apocalypse in the Tropics is a cinematic investigation of fault lines that emerge when religion fuels political ambition. Apocalypse in the Tropics, also titled Apocalipse nos TrÃ³picos in Portuguese, is a doc written \u0026 produced \u0026 directed by acclaimed Brazilian doc filmmaker Petra Costa, director of the other docs Elena, Olmo \u0026 the Seagull, and The Edge of Democracy previously. Produced and co-written by Alessandra Orofino. Executive produced by Jenny Raskin, Jim \u0026 Susan Swartz, Geralyn White Dreyfous, Katrina vanden Heuvel, Jeffrey Lurie, Marie Therese Guirgis, Felipe Estefan, Rafael Georges Zein, Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, Meadow Fund, Katy Drake Bettner, Kate Hurwitz, InMaat, Frida Polli, James Costa, Trevor Burgess. This initially premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival last year, and it also played at Telluride \u0026 NYFF. Netflix releases Costa's Apocalypse in the Tropics streaming on Netflix worldwide starting on July 14th, 2025. ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Find more posts in: Documentaries, To Watch, Trailer",
