The creator, writer, and executive producer of the hit series addressed the criticism the show received throughout its third season, with viewers saying it was too slow. “The pacing and the vibe… it definitely gets under their skin,” White said on the White Lotus Official Season 3 Podcast. “There was complaining about how there’s no plot. That part I find weird. It never did… part of me is just like bro, this is the vibe.” He continued, “I’m world-building. If you don’t want to go to bed with me then get out of my bed. I’m edging you! Enjoy the edging. If you don’t want to be edged, then get out of my bed. Do you know what I mean? Don’t be a bossy bottom. Get the fuck out of my bed. Don’t come home with me. Don’t get naked in my bed. Get the fuck out of my bed. Obviously something is going to happen.” Watch on Deadline RELATED: ‘The White Lotus’ Creator Mike White Unpacks Season 3 Finale As Killers \u0026 Victims Revealed Although many viewers found the pacing of Season 3 slow, the show reached its climax with the explosive finale, which featured several deaths and shocking twists.

Saxon is right about this one thing. I need to get this over with.’ And you know how after she leaves the monastery she’s just like, ‘I need to have sex.’” RELATED: ‘The White Lotus’ Season 3 Stars Aimee Lou Wood, Jason Isaacs \u0026 More React To Explosive Finale: “90 Minutes Of Just Chaos” However, White noted the episode’s run-time, adding, “It would have added 10 minutes to the thing.

It just felt like I was trying to do too much narratively.” RELATED: Mike White Teases Location For Season 4 Of ‘The White Lotus’ Watch the full podcast in the video below.
