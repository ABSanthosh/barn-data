While searching a home in the Eagle Rock neighborhood of Los Angeles on Tuesday afternoon for a hit-and-run suspect, authorities spotted Jillian Shriner in the front yard of her house, located next door, holding a pistol. Police asked her to drop the weapon multiple times, but she refused, instead turning it on the officers. LAPD then opened fire and she was hit in the shoulder. No officers or members of the public were harmed during the incident, according to the LAPD report. After being shot, Jillian Shriner ran inside her home, later reemerging with her babysitter, according to local news reports. She was then taken into custody and brought to a local hospital to be treated for the gunshot wound, which police say was non-life threatening. Popular on Variety The LAPD stated Jillian Shriner had nothing to do with the hit-and-run, and she was later booked for attempted murder. A A 9-millimeter handgun was recovered from the Shriners’ house, according to LAPD. Los Angeles rock band Weezer, co-founded by Scott Shriner, is set to play at Coachella on April 12 and 19. Reps for Scott Shriner did not respond to Variety‘s request for comment, and it is unclear if Jillian Shriner’s arrest will affect the band’s performance at the premiere California music festival. Since their 1994 debut record, “The Blue Album,” Weezer has earned four Grammy nominations, winning one in 2009 for best music video. Some of their top tracks include songs like “Buddy Holly,” “Say It Ain’t So,” “Beverly Hills,” “Islands in the Sun” and “Pork and Beans.”",
