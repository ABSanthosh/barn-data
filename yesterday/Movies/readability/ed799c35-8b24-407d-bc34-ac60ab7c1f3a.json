  "text": "Billboard Women in Music 2025 The viral sequel for “Five Nights at Freddy’s” could be titled….10 nights at Freddy’s? But alas, it’s “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2,” with the original cast of Josh Hutcherson, Elizabeth Lail, Piper Rubio, and Matthew Lillard all returning for more mayhem at the paws of Freddy Fazbear. Hutcherson is back as Mike, the security guard who was trapped in a literal dead-end job at a Chuck E. Cheese-esque arcade and restaurant with five haunted animatronics, including Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie the Rabbit, Foxy the Pirate, Chica the Chicken, and Carl the Cupcake. After he’s forced to bring his 10-year-old sister Abby (Rubio) along for the night shift, Mike has to survive the evening with the help of cop Vanessa (Lail).  “Five Nights at Freddy’s” was a box-office hit in 2023, grossing $297.2 million on a $20 million budget. It was released simultaneously in theaters and on streaming service Peacock. This time however, producer Jason Blum, dressed in a giant Freddy’s bear suit, told the CinemaCon crowd that the sequel would this time open exclusively in theaters. The films are based on Scott Cawthon’s viral indie horror 2014 video game franchise. The franchise has grown to include eight sequels and numerous spinoffs, with a devoted Gen Z fanbase. Warner Bros. Pictures was first set to adapt the game in 2015, before Blumhouse picked up the film in 2017. Chris Columbus was also initially attached to the project, but Emma Tammi ultimately directed the first film. Tammi co-wrote the screenplay with Cawthon and Seth Cuddeback, based on a story by Cawthon, Chris Lee Hill, and Tyler MacIntyre. Cawthon and Jason Blum produced. Lead actor Hutcherson told Variety in 2024 that he was amazed by the audience reaction to the film. “We hoped it would connect with audiences,” Hutcherson said. “But I don’t think that anybody, even on our side of things, expected it to really connect the way that it did. I’m dying to get back on set. Emma Tammi, our director, was fantastic, and it was such a fun world to play in. I’m excited to see what they are doing next.” He added of the sequel at the time, “I know they’re in the process right now of nailing down the story, and they want to get going as soon as possible. Obviously, the fans are amazing and die hard. For me to be a part of it was was so cool and phenomenal.” “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2” premieres December 5 in theaters. Check out the teaser below.",
