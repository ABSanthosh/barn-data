  "description": "\"He stole what's mine... I'm stealing it back.\" Quiver Distribution has unveiled an official trailer for an indie Southern Gothic epic musical movie called The Devil and the Daylong Brothers, made by filmmaker Brandon McCormick as his first real feature. Set in the kudzu-choked backwaters of the American South, it follows three brothers on a blood-soaked, musical quest for revenge against their own father, who sold their souls to the Devil before they were born. The Daylong Brothers are on a quest to reclaim their souls, sold to the Devil by their dad. When the Devil's broker offers them a deal in exchange for their father's whereabouts they hunt the wicked across the South. Starring Brendan Bradley, Nican Robinson, Jordon Bolden, Rainey Qualley, and Keith Carradine. With original music \u0026 songs from producer / composer Nicholas Kirk of Whitestone Pictures, and songs mixed by Michael Brauer. A Southern Gothic gritty crime musical?! Crazy cool concept. And the cinematography in it looks good - knocks it up a few notches. Get a look below.
