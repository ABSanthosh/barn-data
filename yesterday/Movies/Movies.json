Read the full article on AICN Parenthood is sacrifice, and that is the message behind the latest horror film from filmmaker Michael Cummings, aka Spider One of Powerman 5000, aka Rob Zombie's brother. As he puts it in his director's statement: \"In the film, Mindy’s relationship with her monster, Agyar, is clearly my allegory for parenthood. His bites are her pain. His words are her insecurities. His intentions are to prove Mindy’s failure as a parent. We are in solidarity with Mindy, even if, at times we are frustrated and baffled by her actions. And that is exactly the point. She doesn’t know what to do. None of us do. Framing this movie in horror was a natural choice.\" LITTLE BITES tells the story of Mindy Vogel (Krsy Fox, TERRIFIER 3), who is inexplicably saddled with a demon, Agyar (Jon Skarloff, CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER) that demands to feast upon her daughter, Alice. Unwilling to acquiesce, Mindy sends Alice to stay with her mother (Bonnie Arons, THE NUN) while she placates the monster with bites of her own flesh, spinning a plan to rid of her the burden once and for all.  I had the opportunity to speak with writer/director Spider One and lead actress Krsy Fox, neither of whom I felt comfortable addressing by name because I didn't feel entirely sure if Krsy was just pronounced \"Krissy\" and I couldn't rightly look a man in the face and call him \"Spider\". I really wanted to like this feature when I sat down to watch it, and a lot about it is quite Finish the article on AICN",

Moreover, who shepherded us into this bold new world. Director Greg Kohrs and producer Gary Krieg sought this very answer and it brought them to Demis Hassabis.   Demis Hassabis began his journey as a young chess prodigy before shifting gears toward changing the world. He was drawn to the game as a “A fun thinking game,” but after a particularly long battle at a world tournament, he saw a futility in wasting his brain on games when there were real challenges to which he could apply his talents.    During a gap year between high school and college, Demis got an internship at Bullfrog games, where he implemented rudimentary AI into a PC game called Theme Park. His innovation allowed the NPCs to react to each other as well as the gamers’ intervention and create a more interconnected and immersive experience. This caught the eye of Electronic Arts and changed the trajectory of video games for years to come. Despite this transformative influence, Demis focused on college and after graduation sought to tackle the issue of Artificial General Intelligence.   For the uninitiated, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a true thinking creation. Inspired to a point by the AI Deep Blue defeating Chess master Kasparov in 1997, Demis was duly impressed by the victory but saw the limitation of an innovation that could ONLY play chess. As admirable as that was, Demis saw an imminent future where an AI could beat Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Time to take another trip out to an island to escape from the world as we know it. One of my favorite films of the 2025 Berlin Film Festival is this fantastic indie creation called Islands, the latest feature film made by German filmmaker Jan-Ole Gerster. I'm already a big fan of Gerster - his first two feature films A Coffee in Berlin (aka Oh Boy - from 2012) and Lara (from 2019) are two of my favorites as well (and I recommend catching up with both since most people haven't seen them). He's a remarkably talented, crafty filmmaker who comes around every few years with an absolute banger new film that somehow remains under the radar despite getting rave reviews. I hope this one finds a much larger audience outside of Germany, and I expect it will. Islands is his first film entirely in English, set on the popular tourist island of Fuerteventura in the Grand Canary Islands archipelago. I loved it. This is one of 2025 cinema's gems - I will be talking about this film all year long and I'm ready to rewatch it already. I also really need the score to listen to while working. Islands […]",

    "description": "\"We lost our grandma! Who loses their grandma?!\" Disney+ has revealed the official trailer for a comedy movie called Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Road Trip, a sort of spin-off / remake movie inspired by the original Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day movie. The iconic book that this is based on (written by Judith Viorst) was also turned into a cheesy Disney movie in 2014 that got pretty bad / mixed reviews. This next one follows a Mexican American family who have recently lost their connection to each other and their roots, as they embark on an epic road trip that immediately goes hilariously wrong. The new comedy, which stars Eva Longoria, Jesse Garcia, Paulina Chávez, Rose Portillo, Cristo Fernández, Harvey Guillén, Mabel Cadena, Michelle Buteau, and introducing Thom Nemer, with Cheech Marin (hell yes), is directed by Marvin Lemus and written by Matt Lopez. D+ is releasing it streaming in March, skipping theaters entirely for home. This looks like it wants to be another National Lampoon's Vacation but is still nowhere near as funny as that comedy classic.
