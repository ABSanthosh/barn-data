    "description": "McEric cleans up his inbox by dumping reviews for NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, RENNER, MOB COPS, and YOUNG WERTHER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all!  I've got some reviews of two films releasing this Friday, April 25th - but thought I'd also take this opportunity to highlight two other films that are already out there but I haven't yet found the time to cover. Hopefully there's something here for everyone, so let's get right to it: First up is NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, starring Jack Quaid (NOVOCAINE, THE COMPANION, \"The Boys\"), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (\"The Boys,\" \"The Walking Dead\"), and Malin Ackerman (WATCHMEN, SLAYERS), directed by Duncan Skiles (THE CLOVEHITCH KILLER) and written by Sean Farley. The film features troubled young man Simon McNally (Quaid), who is trying to find his feet after spending a decade in a facility for mental health treatment, and his paranoid ex-security guard neighbor Ed Deerman. The two form an unlikely partnership when Simon believes he's seen a woman kidnapped but is deemed an unreliable witness by police due to his history and behavior. The two men take it upon themselves to investigate the crime and rescue the woman, revealing a deeper web of villainy in their quiet town. Quaid and Morgan have great chemistry, and Quaid, specifically, does some great work in this film. Whereas the majority of his characters have been able to rely and charm and humor, Simon is stripped of these tools due to the abuse he received at a young age, so the tricks that Quaid would normally utilize to endear himself to audiences are out of reach. Quaid does a great job of humanizing McNally as a Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Actress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"We can win with something the other teams don't have - and that's The Rhythm.\" Samuel Goldwyn Films has revealed the official trailer for an indie hockey movie called The Rhythm, formerly known as Black Ice: The Rhythm - the first film made by director Gerald McBride. I'd really wish they kept that original title Black Ice, because this other one does not really do much. It's the inspirational story of a Black hockey player who is sentenced to community service at a local hockey rink, where he leads his misfit hockey team to victory in a seemingly bigoted sport \u0026 league. Robert helps transform a group of roller skaters into a championship-caliber ice-hockey team by harnessing their natural talent \u0026 passion, but they must confront racism and discrimination in the predominantly white world of the sport. Arthur Cartwright stars with Jaclene Wilk, Devante Jamar Adams, Carlos Faison, Jovonn Crittendon, Shawnta McDougle. This is pretty much just a Mighty Ducks remake, which is fine, just wish they'd mix up the story somehow. Also a chance to remind everyone of the Black hockey documentary called Black Ice - available on Hulu now. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Gerald McBride's […]",

Roadside Attractions has unveiled the official trailer for a gritty new western titled The Unholy Trinity, lead by an impressive cast. Yet another western thriller that most people probably have never heard of before - they keep churning these out. \"The past never stays buried.\" Pierce Brosnan, Samuel L. Jackson, and Brandon Lessard star in the western epic The Unholy Trinity, riding into theaters in June. Buried secrets of an 1870s Montana town spark violence when a young man returns to reclaim his legacy and is caught between a sheriff determined to maintain order and this stranger hell-bent on destroying it. Described as \"an exciting blend of action, suspense, and western grit.\" The cast includes Veronica Ferres, Gianni Capaldi, Q'orianka Kilcher, David Arquette, Ethan Peck, Tim Daly, Anthony J.
