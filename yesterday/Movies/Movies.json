    "description": "Barbarella Declares BRING HER BACK is an Intense Depiction of the Effects of Grief Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends. Barbarella here still reeling from the incredibly intense Australian horror flick Bring Her Back, which comes out on May 30th. Not for the weak of heart, this follow-up from the minds behind Talk to Me grips one’s innards early on and doesn’t let go for the entire duration.  While themes of grief and the different ways individuals cope with loss may not be uncommon in cinema, Bring Her Back approaches the concept in a truly unique fashion through the individuals involved and the manner in which their stories are told.  Sora Wong debuts as the young Piper. Giving a powerhouse performance, she proves that a face doesn’t have to be recognizable to bring the awesomeness. While Piper may be the nucleus of the story, it’s not just her, but also those around her, who drive the points, like nails, into your soul.  I’ll start with Sally Hawkins, whom you may recognize from The Shape of Water. Her portrayal of the adoptive parent is nothing short of exceptional. Nuanced when necessary, flat out psycho when required, she navigates the extremes and subtleties like a master.  While I could ramble about Sally Hawkins more, let’s move on to Jonah Wren Phillips. He’s incredible as the creepy kid, but it’s in those moments where we glimpse his humanity that this young talent shines. I should warn you, though, if he’s onscreen, the odds of you feeling uncomfortable increase 85%. Owning the most disturbing scenes, he can be hard to watch at times. In fact, when Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric takes a look at some of the films screening at this year's Tribeca Film Festival in NYC from June 4th - 15th. Read the full article on AICN The Tribeca Film Festival is set to descend once again upon New York City this June 4th through 15th. Begun in 2002 by Robert DeNiro, Jane Rosenthal, and Craig Hatkoff, the festival sought to revitalize Lower Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks and has since become one of the premiere film festivals of North America. This year, alone, the programmers narrowed down their selections from over 13,000 submissions. This year's line-up boasts 95 world premieres from filmmakers across 36 countries, collecting everything from feature films to shorts, episodic content, audio storytelling, interactive games, and more.  I'll be on site for several days of the festival to screen films and speak with attending talent, so let's take a look at some of the selections that made my shortlist of interest: First off, the big trend this year is music documentaries - the festival has programmed at least fifteen music-based films, beginning with the opening night gala selection BILLY JOEL: AND SO IT GOES. The festivities will likely be more of a eulogy than a celebration due to recent developments, but it's still nice to kick off a definitively New York festival with one of the City's own beloved sons as the subject of its inaugural film. Other documentaries that feature prominently are METALLICA SAVED MY LIFE, BILLY IDOL SHOULD BE DEAD, BOY GEORGE 7 CULTURE CLUB, DEPECHE MODE: M, I WAS BORN THIS WAY: CARL BEAN, MOVE YA BODY: THE BIRTH OF HOUSE, and THE SIXTH BOROUGH. This final film made my shortlist as Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"We're gonna be okay, right?\" \"I hope so... it would suck if we werent.\" Quiver Distribution has unveiled an official trailer for an absurd new comedy called Nuked, about a group of friends who get super stoned. The title isn't really a pun on being high, it's actually related to the story and what happens while they're high. This premiered at last year's Tribeca Film Festival and will be released this summer on VOD for everyone to also get stoned and watch. A group of friends gets together for a cannabis-infused, technology free, dinner party only to learn a bomb is headed right for them. This seems to be a riff on that Hawaii nuclear missile freak out from 2018, where they accidentally announced that a missile was on the way for 30 minutes before it was called off as a mistake. The pot kicks in right as they realize that they may only have 30 minutes to live... What will they do? The cast features Anna Camp, Justin Bartha, Lucy Punch, George Young, Tawny Newsome, Ignacio Serrichio, Maulik Pancholy, Stephen Guarino, Natasha Leggero, and Cole Stockel.

    "description": "\"Remembering you're dreaming...\" Vertical has revealed the official trailer for Eye for an Eye, a horror thriller set in Florida marking the feature directorial debut of acclaimed music video director Colin Tilley. Not to be confused with any other film also titled Eye for an Eye, such as the 1996 thriller movie with Kiefer Sutherland \u0026 Sally Field. This is the story of Anna who grieves the death of her parents as she moves from New York to Florida to stay with her grandmother. She falls in with some other teens, but when she sees a grisly act of violence, she ends up even more traumatized. She finds herself ensnared by Mr. Sandman – the twisted soul of a tormented child who haunts bullies' dreams before feasting on their eyeballs. Uhhh whoa, WTF. Staring Whitney Peak, S. Epatha Merkerson, Golda Rosheuvel, and Finn Bennett. This looks like it has tons of creepy imagery, but the story looks quite generic. Doesn't seem like it'll amount to much.
