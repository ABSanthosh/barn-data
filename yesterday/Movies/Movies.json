    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN In a new AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SEGMENT, I will do something terrifically similar to what I did the last time I did this segment, and now that I'm reading that out loud I realize how ridiculous it sounds. Regardless, I once again enter the realm of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and speak with a specialist about what the United States knows, what it doesn't, and the barriers that are preventing it from disclosing its full knowledge to the public. Let's get one thing established right away: the conversation around alien visitation has changed. When I chatted with Disclosure Activist Stephen Bassett back in 2021, we weren't discussing if these visitations were real but rather why we weren't being told about them. Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien. That part is transparent, but THE PROGRAM's findings aren't, and that is the subject of filmmaker James Fox's new documentary, THE PROGRAM. I chatted with James Fox, filmmaker of The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and I Know What I Saw, to discuss THE PROGRAM after viewing it, and though we were able to talk for quite a while, I didn't really have that many questions.

Set for release in February just in time for Valentine's Day - including on VOD to watch at home if you want. It's the end of the world. Seeking meaning and thrills in their last days alive, Rose and Michael embark on a cross-country road trip as a devastating asteroid threatens to wipe out life on Earth. While journeying to see her grandmother one last time before they perish, they fight to find meaning and adventure in the world's final week. Starring Andrew Ortenberg \u0026 June Schreiner as Michael \u0026 Rose, with Thalia Besson, Lauren Cohan, and Dermot Mulroney. Bryan Curtis of The Ringer also voices a radio DJ updating citizens on the progress of the asteroids as the hours tick down. This trailer plays up how crazy people would be if it was really happening, hence why it's more of a thriller. Looks quite good.

An empowering, uplifting documentary to debut during wintertime - it's produced by Imagine Entertainment. Harlem Ice is a 5-part documentary series following the girls of Figure Skating in Harlem as they prepare for competitions, performances and a life changing global experience. Through their eyes, we experience the highs and lows of the FSH Season, and the unique experiences they have as girls of color breaking the ice ceiling and gaining access to a global stage. We follow sisters Tori and Ashley, newbie Adrianna and senior Ariyana, and see how each girl makes her mark and helps to put Harlem Ice on the map. This looks exactly like the ideal Disney+ doc to feature as a way of inspiring more young people to go out and try new things.
