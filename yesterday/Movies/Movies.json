Read the full article on AICN In a new AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SEGMENT, I will do something terrifically similar to what I did the last time I did this segment, and now that I'm reading that out loud I realize how ridiculous it sounds. Regardless, I once again enter the realm of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and speak with a specialist about what the United States knows, what it doesn't, and the barriers that are preventing it from disclosing its full knowledge to the public. Let's get one thing established right away: the conversation around alien visitation has changed. When I chatted with Disclosure Activist Stephen Bassett back in 2021, we weren't discussing if these visitations were real but rather why we weren't being told about them. Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien. That part is transparent, but THE PROGRAM's findings aren't, and that is the subject of filmmaker James Fox's new documentary, THE PROGRAM. I chatted with James Fox, filmmaker of The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and I Know What I Saw, to discuss THE PROGRAM after viewing it, and though we were able to talk for quite a while, I didn't really have that many questions.

Read the full article on AICN Everything about film has changed, and while some lambast this brave new world, it does have its silver linings. Streaming services took over channels and then became their own studios. For every Netflix dud there's a great horror film championed by SHUDDER, Bloody Disgusting, or Fangoria that would go otherwise unproduced. SHUDDER, specifically, has been picking up amazing films, from last year's LATE NIGHT WITH THE DEVIL to this year's IN A VIOLENT NATURE. The studio is ending the year strong with a meta take on the coming-of-age slasher rom-com called BLOODY AXE WOUND, releasing in limited theaters before landing on the streamer in early 2025. The synopsis is as follows: Abbie Bladecut (Sari Arambulo, \"A.P. Bio\") is a teenager torn between the macabre traditions of her family’s bloody trade and the tender stirrings of her first crush (Molly Brown, \"Dexter: Original Sin\"). In the small town of Clover Falls, Abbie’s father, Roger Bladecut (Billy Burke, TWILIGHT), has built an infamous legacy by capturing real-life killings on tape and selling them to eager customers, but as Abbie delves deeper into the grisly family business, she begins to wonder if it’s time to take the family tradition in a new direction.  The conceit of the film is surprisingly fresh in a genre that finds new ways to reinvent itself with shocking regularity. Set within the confines of a horror film, we see what it might be like to grow up in a family where the patriarch is a serial killer/slasher who rises from the grave Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"With my help you'll achieve greatness.\" Marvel has revealed an official trailer for their next new animated Spidey series called Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man arriving for streaming this January on Disney+. \"Every neighborhood needs a hero.\" Parker! This is a brand new take on a Spider-Man animated cartoon for kids created by animation writer Jeff Trammell. Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man (so YFNSM for short?) follows Peter Parker on his way to becoming a hero, with a journey unlike we've seen and a style that celebrates the character's early comic book roots. It's set in an alternate timeline where Norman Osborn becomes Parker's mentor instead of Tony Stark. The voice cast includes Hudson Thames as Peter, Colman Domingo as Osborn, Eugene Byrd, Grace Song, Zeno Robinson, Hugh Dancy as Octavius, and Charlie Cox as Daredevil. They've modernized it and Spidey also has his own livestream, to connect with the app-addicted youth nowadays. It seems like a fun time - though I still prefer Morales' Spider-Verse.

    "description": "No matter how hard you might try to delay and/or hold off death, you can never stop or slow down time. It marches on without ever slowing down. Always... This lovely, mesmerizing animated short film called The Boy Who Cheated Death is about a young boy confronting the reality of death. The 5-minute animated short is created by a Vietnamese filmmaker named Pipou Phuong Nguyen who lives and works in France. This short features a handful of different animation styles – starting out with conventional hand-drawn 2D with various stop-motion vignettes, utilizing papercraft, fabric, felt, and more. It tells the story of a little boy who tries to hide his mother from Death - taking him on a journey across space and time, interacting with animals and nature. The point is not to leave people feeling sad, rather the film \"invites you to embrace the fragility of life.\" Featuring original music by Antoine Duchêne. So maybe this boy can't really cheat death (can anyone?), but it seems like he does come to understand it better by the end of this story. Watch below. Thanks to Short of the Week for the tip on this one. Brief intro from YouTube: \"In […]",
