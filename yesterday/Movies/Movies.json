    "description": "Barbarella Declares BRING HER BACK is an Intense Depiction of the Effects of Grief Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends. Barbarella here still reeling from the incredibly intense Australian horror flick Bring Her Back, which comes out on May 30th. Not for the weak of heart, this follow-up from the minds behind Talk to Me grips one’s innards early on and doesn’t let go for the entire duration.  While themes of grief and the different ways individuals cope with loss may not be uncommon in cinema, Bring Her Back approaches the concept in a truly unique fashion through the individuals involved and the manner in which their stories are told.  Sora Wong debuts as the young Piper. Giving a powerhouse performance, she proves that a face doesn’t have to be recognizable to bring the awesomeness. While Piper may be the nucleus of the story, it’s not just her, but also those around her, who drive the points, like nails, into your soul.  I’ll start with Sally Hawkins, whom you may recognize from The Shape of Water. Her portrayal of the adoptive parent is nothing short of exceptional. Nuanced when necessary, flat out psycho when required, she navigates the extremes and subtleties like a master.  While I could ramble about Sally Hawkins more, let’s move on to Jonah Wren Phillips. He’s incredible as the creepy kid, but it’s in those moments where we glimpse his humanity that this young talent shines. I should warn you, though, if he’s onscreen, the odds of you feeling uncomfortable increase 85%. Owning the most disturbing scenes, he can be hard to watch at times. In fact, when Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric takes a look at some of the films screening at this year's Tribeca Film Festival in NYC from June 4th - 15th. Read the full article on AICN The Tribeca Film Festival is set to descend once again upon New York City this June 4th through 15th. Begun in 2002 by Robert DeNiro, Jane Rosenthal, and Craig Hatkoff, the festival sought to revitalize Lower Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks and has since become one of the premiere film festivals of North America. This year, alone, the programmers narrowed down their selections from over 13,000 submissions. This year's line-up boasts 95 world premieres from filmmakers across 36 countries, collecting everything from feature films to shorts, episodic content, audio storytelling, interactive games, and more.  I'll be on site for several days of the festival to screen films and speak with attending talent, so let's take a look at some of the selections that made my shortlist of interest: First off, the big trend this year is music documentaries - the festival has programmed at least fifteen music-based films, beginning with the opening night gala selection BILLY JOEL: AND SO IT GOES. The festivities will likely be more of a eulogy than a celebration due to recent developments, but it's still nice to kick off a definitively New York festival with one of the City's own beloved sons as the subject of its inaugural film. Other documentaries that feature prominently are METALLICA SAVED MY LIFE, BILLY IDOL SHOULD BE DEAD, BOY GEORGE 7 CULTURE CLUB, DEPECHE MODE: M, I WAS BORN THIS WAY: CARL BEAN, MOVE YA BODY: THE BIRTH OF HOUSE, and THE SIXTH BOROUGH. This final film made my shortlist as Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"That bro must be the villain.\" Well Go USA has revealed an official US trailer for Hi-Five, a Korean action comedy about people who get superpowers after receiving organ transplants. It just opened in Korea last week, and will also arrive in US theaters in a few more weeks. After receiving mysterious organ transplants, five strangers awaken with five extraordinary abilities. Banding together, they become an unlikely superhero team that will be known as the \"Hi-Five.\" These five suddenly develop various superpower abilities after receiving transplants from a man with psychic superpower. They must defend themselves from a different group of people who seek to steal their powers. The cast features Lee Jae-in, who gets a heart transplant and becomes very strong; Ahn Jae-hong, who receives a lung transplant and is able to hold his breath for a long time; Kim Hee-won, who receives a liver transplant and becomes a healer; Yoo Ah-in, who receives a corneal transplant and can interact with electromagnetic waves. Along with Ra Mi-ran, Yoo Ah-in, Oh Jung-se, and Park Jin-young. The looks super cheesy and extra goofy, hopefully still fun enough to enjoy. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Kang Hyoung-chul's movie Hi-Five, direct […]",

After diving into a worldclass selection of films across 12 days at the 78th Cannes Film Festival, and after watching a grand total of 43 films, it's time to present my 2025 list of my Top 10 Favorites. This was my 15th year back to this prestigious festival right on the Mediterranean, and I still love being in the middle of all the buzz and action, watching brand new cinema every single day. As I usually say - there's always more to discover, so always keep watching. These ten 2025 favorites listed below are the ones that connected with me emotionally or intellectually, and I hope you'll consider keeping an eye out for them whenever they show up in your neighborhood. Each one is clever and exciting and beautiful in its own way. It might have been another fairly unexciting Cannes selection overall, many colleagues have expressed the same, though I am always delighted to discover some incredible films anyway.
