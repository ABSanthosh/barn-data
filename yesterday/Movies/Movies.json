Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

Read the full article on AICN Found footage horror. Do you love it? Do you hate it? Do you think it is its own genre or do you lump it in with its overarching tone - slasher, supernatural, monster, etc. Love it or hate it, the convention is here to stay, as it offers a realistic, relatable approach to horror that blurs the lines between reality, film, empathy, and voyeurism.   So, when I got an email asking if I wanted to screen the feature DEVON, written and directed by Jenni “JWoww” Farley, I said “of course I do!” My wife is a fan of “Jersey Shore” and has been since day one, so I mostly did it for her, but I was also very curious what the singular star would bring to the horror pantheon. The logline read:   Devon's parents never stopped searching for answers after her disappearance from a notorious asylum. Years after the incident, a mysterious website draws five adventurers to the abandoned asylum where she was last seen. Armed with cameras, they plunge into the darkness, unaware they’re filming their own descent into horror—never meant to return.     I got the chance to chat with writer/director/producer Jenni “JWoww” Farley about jumping into a feature-length film, the serendipitous location, and her crew.      Eric McClanahan: Hey, Jenni! How are you?   Jenni “JWoww” Farley: Good. Nervous.    EM: Nervous? Why are you nervous?   JJF: I feel like this is [me] kind of starting my career over. It’s a different world, a different element. I am a superfan of horror films; I have been since I Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"That's a TV! Are they seeing what we're seeing?\" Paramount has revealed a new making of featurette video for the film September 5, one of the major Oscar contenders in play this awards season. The official trailer dropped a few months ago, and the film premiered at both the 2024 Venice \u0026 Telluride Film Fests earlier in the fall. During the 1972 Munich Olympics (on September 5th, 1972), an American sports broadcasting crew finds itself thrust into covering the hostage crisis involving Israeli athletes. The film focuses on the crew of the ABC Sports TV station that was located right inside the Olympic village, covering all the sports events live for the first time ever in TV history. The superb ensemble cast in the film includes Peter Sarsgaard, John Magaro, Ben Chaplin, Leonie Benesch, Zinedine Soualem, Marcus Rutherford, Georgina Rich, Corey Johnson, Daniel Adeosun, Benjamin Walker, Ferdinand Dörfler. This featurette is more of a more detailed intro to the film and the story it's telling, setting it up better than the trailer did. It's a fascinating story of this TV crew at this moment having to decide then \u0026 there how to proceed. Great film. Here's the \"Live On Air\" […]",

Dark Sky Films has released a full trailer for the Australian indie psychological horror film called Birdeater, which played at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival earlier this year. We posted a teaser back then just before its US debut - now set to hit theaters in January after a festival run this year. Birdeater is an unsettling thriller that \"represents a visually striking and daring debut from this Australian duo.\" A bride-to-be joins her fiance's bachelor party up in the remote Australian Outback. As the festivities spiral into beer-soaked chaos, uncomfortable details about their relationship are exposed, turning the celebration into a feral nightmare. Starring Shabana Azeez, Mackenzie Fearnley, Ben Hunter, Jack Bannister, Clementine Anderson, Alfie Gledhill, Harley Wilson, and Caroline McQuade. This looks super messed up and strange and extremely crazy. It's definitely not for everyone.
