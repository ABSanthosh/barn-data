    "description": "Actress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric reviews (new) releases RAGING MIDLIFE and AMERICAN DREAMER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a quick review of two (new) releases hitting the market this St. Patrick's Day Weekend, both of which I actually enjoyed. RAGING MIDLIFE First was RAGING MIDLIFE, a movie that was pitched to me as starring Paula Abdul (I'm a massive fan), Eddie Griffin (DOUBLE TAKE), Walter Koenig (STAR TREK), and Motch O. Mann, the world's foremost Macho Man Randy Savage impersonator. Yeah, I hear it, too. Luckily, I didn't read any further. I saw Paula Abdul's name and shouted \"I'm in!\" Going in to this film blind is the best way to see it. As I'm furnishing you with a review, however, I must speak further to the film. If you want to skip down to AMERICAN DREAMER and go in blind, I do suggest it. Otherwise, here we go. The film, written by Nic Costa and Rob Taylor, and directed by the latter, follows childhood friends Alex and Mark, now in their midlives (see that?) who are chasing their dragon - a purple tanktop once worn by their favorite wrestler, Raging Abe. Raging Abe is a Macho Man Randy Savage-type character who wears a stove pipe hat and chin beard and lives by five \"proclamations,\" all meant to help his young fans navigate life and walk as better people. The film opens with grainy footage of a talk show appearance (think Arsenio Hall) from Raging Abe and his handler, Mary Todd, played by Abdul. The action opens in the eighties with young Alex and Mark ringside Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"Did I do it right?\" Prepare to be scared. A24 has debuted another new teaser trailer for the disquieting new horror Bring Her Back, the latest creation from the brothers Danny \u0026 Michael Philippou - the Australian filmmakers (also called RackaRacka) who brought us Talk To Me. Described as \"visceral new horror\" and the only synopsis so far states: \"A brother and sister uncover a terrifying ritual at the secluded home of their new foster mother.\" What is she up to with them? Who is she trying to bring back and why? This looks like it's going to get extra dark \u0026 freaky (view the full trailer). Bring Her Back stars Sally Hawkins, with Billy Barrat, Sora Wong, Jonah Wren Phillips, Sally-Anne Upton, \u0026 Stephen Phillips. Ready for a late summer 2025 release at the end of May coming up very soon. This is looking creepier and creepier the more they show. The cat from the first teaser makes an appearance in this trailer, which is much more unsettling.

One of the many debuts during Star Wars Celebration in Tokyo, Japan this past weekend was a first look at the next collection of Star Wars shorts in the Star Wars: Visions series. The first volume of Star Wars: Visions anime shorts launched in 2021, with Volume 2 debuting in 2023, and now we have another set of nine awe-inspiring new shorts arriving later in 2025. One of the nine is titled Black, and director Shinya Ohira (from the same studio who made the Kill Bill: Vol. 1 animated segment) personally introduces a 30-second clip. This one wowed me the most - a Tie fighter vs X-wing scene with such a distinct look (I dig the cackle when it goes into the cockpit). All of these new shorts look incredible! I adore this series! There's always so much creativity, so many unique stories \u0026 ideas. I really, really love the visual styles here. There's two new previews below - view both and be amazed.
