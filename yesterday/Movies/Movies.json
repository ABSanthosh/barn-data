Read the full article on AICN Parenthood is sacrifice, and that is the message behind the latest horror film from filmmaker Michael Cummings, aka Spider One of Powerman 5000, aka Rob Zombie's brother. As he puts it in his director's statement: \"In the film, Mindy’s relationship with her monster, Agyar, is clearly my allegory for parenthood. His bitesare her pain. His words are her insecurities. His intentions are to prove Mindy’s failure as a parent. Weare in solidarity with Mindy, even if, at times we are frustrated and baffled by her actions. And that isexactly the point. She doesn’t know what to do. None of us do. Framing this movie in horror was anatural choice.\" LITTLE BITES tells the story of Mindy Vogel (Krsy Fox, TERRIFIER 3), who is inexplicably saddled with a demon, Agyar (Jon Skarloff, CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER) that demands to feast upon her daughter, Alice. Unwilling to acquiesce, Mindy sends Alice to stay with her mother (Bonnie Arons, THE NUN) while she placates the monster with bites of her own flesh, spinning a plan to rid of her the burden once and for all.  I had the opportunity to speak with writer/director Spider One and lead actress Krsy Fox, neither of whom I felt comfortable addressing by name because I didn't feel entirely sure if Krsy was just pronounced \"Krissy\" and I couldn't rightly look a man in the face and call him \"Spider\". I really wanted to like this feature when I sat down to watch it, and a lot about it is quite Finish the article on AICN",

Moreover, who shepherded us into this bold new world. Director Greg Kohrs and producer Gary Krieg sought this very answer and it brought them to Demis Hassabis.   Demis Hassabis began his journey as a young chess prodigy before shifting gears toward changing the world. He was drawn to the game as a “A fun thinking game,” but after a particularly long battle at a world tournament, he saw a futility in wasting his brain on games when there were real challenges to which he could apply his talents.    During a gap year between high school and college, Demis got an internship at Bullfrog games, where he implemented rudimentary AI into a PC game called Theme Park. His innovation allowed the NPCs to react to each other as well as the gamers’ intervention and create a more interconnected and immersive experience. This caught the eye of Electronic Arts and changed the trajectory of video games for years to come. Despite this transformative influence, Demis focused on college and after graduation sought to tackle the issue of Artificial General Intelligence.   For the uninitiated, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a true thinking creation. Inspired to a point by the AI Deep Blue defeating Chess master Kasparov in 1997, Demis was duly impressed by the victory but saw the limitation of an innovation that could ONLY play chess. As admirable as that was, Demis saw an imminent future where an AI could beat Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"I think I'm really starting to understand more about the Lord's path for me...\" Magnolia Pics has unveiled an official trailer for an indie drama titled Eric LaRue, the directorial debut of actor Michael Shannon. This originally premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival a few years back, and has never been released in the two years since. It also played at the Denver \u0026 Chicago Film Festivals that year. In Shannon's directorial debut adapted from Brett Neveu's 2002 renowned stage play, Janice (Greer) is struggling... In the aftermath of a shocking crime at the hands of her son, she moves through life in a haze, unable to let go of her anger and frustration. While her husband Ron has found refuge at a new church, Janice finds it hard to seek solace in her faith despite her pastor's pleas to heal her wounds within the congregation. As she ponders her role in the community, she questions whether there is any established path to healing from an experience such as hers. Starring Judy Greer, Alexander Skarsgård, Alison Pill, Paul Sparks, and Tracy Letts. This is finally opening in April this spring. It seems like it's very similar to Mass and […]",

    "description": "\"General Solo, is your strike team assembled?\" Time for a super fun blast from the past! Take a trip back into Coralie Fargeat's childhood. In honor of the Academy Award nominations for French director Coralie Fargeat's body horror film The Substance, Letterboxd has posted her very first film online. Fargeat dug up an old VHS tape from the 1990s that features her own homemade Star Wars movie - they scanned it and digitized it and now we can all enjoy it. Fargeat is nominated for Best Director at the Oscars this year, and The Substance has a total of five nominations. It's her second feature film after making Revenge (2017) previously. This homemade Star Wars (titled La Guerre des étoiles in French) is kind of a remix of all of the three original movies, and features miniatures / action figures, some footage borrowed from the movies, and some of her own footage shot with her friends in the woods. This clunky no-budget VHS filmmaking is so much fun to see! Those Stormtroopers are hilarious. Click on [cc] for English subtitles in the video below. Thanks to Letterboxd for posting this.
