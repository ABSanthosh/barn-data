    "description": "McEric sits down with THE DAILY SHOW writer Daniel Radosh and editor Lauren Beckett Jackson for an interview Read the full article on AICN Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” has been on-air for almost thirty years, garnering 26 PrimeTime Emmy Awards and several Peabody Awards for its writing and execution. Many are familiar with the show’s blend of current news commentary and informational journalism from comedians like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Steve Carrell, John Oliver, Samatha Bee, Roy Wood, Jr, Rob Riggle, Jordan Klepper, Wyatt Cenac, Hasan Minhaj, Larry Whitmore, Lewis Black, Desi Lydic, Ronny Chieng, Michael Kosta, and a bevy of others. “The Daily Show’s” audience has grown up alongside the show, with viewership now skewing in higher age demographics than the coveted 18-34 bracket it dominated during its inception. That maturity is reflected in the current iteration of the show, with Stewart hosting on Monday’s while the rest of “The Best F**king News Team” fill in the remainder of the week. “The Daily Show” is a bit of a misnomer as the show broadcasts nightly on Comedy Central (or Paramount+ for those living in the streaming age) from Monday to Thursday. I suppose “The Intermittent Show” just doesn’t have the same ring to it. “The Daily Show” is not unique in its position as a satirical news program, however it remains the definitive iteration of the format. Everyone knows about “The Daily Show,” love it or hate it. A foundational pillar of the show’s ubiquity and popularity is in the writing and execution of the show, which stands head and shoulders above its contemporaries.   I was honored to speak with senior writer Daniel Radosh Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Scott Adkins talks with McEric about his new action film, DIABLO Read the full article on AICN If you’re a fan of current action films then you likely know the name Scott Adkins. He’s either kicked the ass of or had his ass kicked by every action star of the last five decades: Dolph Lundgren, Jackie Chan, Sylvester Stallone, Jean Claude Van Damme, Jet Li, and even Keanu Reeves. That’s right - he was the big guy with the grill in JOHN WICK CHAPTER 4.  Scott’s newest film is DIABLO, which hits theaters and on demand this Friday, June 13th. Conceived alongside action compatriot Marko Zaror, the film takes place in Colombia following Adkins as Kris, a former convict, who seeks to make good on a promise to a fallen friend, which runs him afoul of Zaror’s mercenary, El Corvo. This film isn’t just another straight-to-streaming no-budget piece of content - DIABLO delivers on every front. The fight scenes, choreographed by Zaror, are intense and deftly photographed, thanks to director Ernesto Diaz Espinoza. The gunplay is intense, the acting is top tier, and the film never lags.    Marko Zaror steals his scenes as El Corvo, a mercenary with an iron fist, literally. The six-foot-two Chilean action star has a chilling villain introduction, followed by a massive action scene in a sketchy hideout that plays out like a scene from TERMINATOR. He mows through assailants and bystanders alike with no emotion, only showing a hint of fear when Adkins’s Kris shows up to give him a real fight. El Corvo is fucking terrifying. Their final confrontation is a throwback to Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"She's not gone... she spoke to me too last night.\" Greenwich Entertainment has unveiled the first official trailer for Went Up the Hill, an intriguing ghost story film from New Zealand. This initially premiered at the 2024 Toronto Film Festival last year, and will be released in limited theaters this summer in the US. The second feature made by Kiwi director Samuel Van Grinsven, also of Sequin in a Blue Room before this. Jack ventures to remote New Zealand for the funeral of his estranged mother and meets her widow Jill. But his mother's spirit returns to inhabit each of their bodies – instigating a life-threatening three-way nocturnal dance. Went Up the Hill is a psychological drama is inspired by writer / director Samuel Van Grinsven's own memories of his childhood in New Zealand’s South Island. An intimate, modern ghost story that explores the extremities of grief in our pursuit of letting go. The film stars Dacre Montgomery, Vicky Krieps, and Sarah Peirse. This looks like it has some serious style, with slick cinematography by DP Tyson Perkins, along with an unsettling supernatural tale to tell. Described in reviews as \"stunning, uneasy, \u0026 harrowing.\" Here's the first official trailer for […]",

    "description": "\"You're asking for the grave.\" Quiver Distribution has unveiled an official trailer for a western called Long Shadows, another redundant American western drama about a batch of desperate people getting into even more trouble when everyone starts trying to kill everyone else. It's directed by actor William Shockley as his feature directorial debut, and also features former NFL star Tom Brady as a producer. When a young boy's mother and father are savagely murdered, he ages out of an orphanage intent on revenge, but the love of a girl and psychological trauma lead him down a mystifying path. In a rapidly modernizing American West, Long Shadows is the riveting story of a broken young man, a survivor of tragic violence, torn between his thirst for vengeance and love's redemption, \u0026 his soul so fractured reality itself is questioned. This western action thriller stars Dermot Mulroney \u0026 Dominic Monaghan, with Jacqueline Bisset, Blaine Maye, Sarah Cortez, Chris Mulkey, Anthony Skordi, and Ronnie Gene Blevins. This looks slightly better than most of the junk westerns being made recently, but still nothing to write home about. It's worth a look. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for William Shockley's western film Long Shadows, […]",
