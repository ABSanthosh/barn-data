Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a review of the Furst Brothers' new horror/comedy A BREED APART, out now in theaters and on-demand. The film follows several Internet celebrities who are invited to an island overrun by rabid dogs to compete for a prize... survival. Check out the trailer: The film stars Grace Caroline Currey (SHAZAM: FURY OF THE GODS, FALL), Virginia Gardner (FALL, 2018's HALLOWEEN), Page Kennedy (THE MEG, THE MEG 2), Troy Gentile (ABC's \"The Goldbergs\"), Riele Downs (Nickelodeon's \"Henry Danger\"), Zak Steiner (Netflix's \"Jessica Jones\"),and Hayden Panittiere (NBC's \"Heroes\"). The film is directed by Griff Furst and brother Nathan Furst, whose previous collaboration as co-directors brought us NIGHTMARE SHARK. Solo, Griff Furst has directed such films as SWAMP SHARK, GHOST SHARK, and TRAILER PARK SHARK, so he clearly knows his way around a creature feature... even if he doesn't really want to. \"Who is Louie Myman?\" I asked when we spoke this past Friday. [Louie Myman is the credited director of Furst's films 100 MILLION BC and ALLIGATOR ALLEY.) \"Oh, Louie Myman! Do you know Alan Smithee?\" \"Yes.\" \"He's Alan Smithee's brother. Yeah, I mean, it's a tough thing. It's an interesting thing to explore. It's like when you do a creature feature and it rates well, and it does well, they just offer you more of them. And I love them, don't get me wrong. I grew up watching all these creature features - Mysterious Island and Jaws and Cujo. I love those movies, but I love ALL kinds of movies. The creature feature, itself, Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Barbarella Says Tim Robinson Makes FRIENDSHIP Fantastic! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here back from hiatus, and I’m delighted to share my thoughts on A24’s newest release, Friendship, which is out NOW! Sometimes people watch trailers and think, “Oh this movie is like [insert movie about a similar topic].” If you’re thinking that about Friendship, it’s not. Genuinely funny without being cruel, Andrew DeYoung’s exploration of adult male friendship proves charming and elicits more than a few hearty laughs from me.  In an era where seemingly fewer friendships exist in the real world than online, making new friends may be challenging, particularly for adult men. Keeping them may be nearly impossible.  When Craig (Tim Robinson) receives a misdelivered package intended for cool new neighbor Austin (Paul Rudd), Craig walks it over to him. Upon meeting the charismatic and friendly guy, he quickly gets invited in and finds himself actually making friends. His expressions reveal his delight in this newly formed camaraderie with someone who is just so darned interesting. One can’t help but feel happy for his new accomplishment.   Sadly, new friendships are fragile, and in a group setting, Craig doesn’t make the best impression on the guys. It doesn’t take long before Austin begins distancing himself from the awkward neighbor. In his desperation to rekindle the closeness they once shared, Craig makes some questionable decisions that lead to more awkward situations and laughs. On the surface, this is a quirky comedy that relies heavily on Tim Robinson’s performance. However, there is much more to this movie. Throughout, it addresses many common insecurities that men Finish the article on AICN",

    "link": "https://www.firstshowing.net/2025/cannes-2025-magnificent-chilean-musical-the-wave-is-empowering/",
    "description": "The Cannes Film Festival is once again featuring a never-seen-before musical that will shock and surprise and dazzle audiences. Last year, Jacques Audiard's ambitious (and eventually controversial) musical Emilia Perez premiered at Cannes. This year, Chilean filmmaker Sebastián Lelio's new film The Wave premiered at Cannes – though not in the Main Competition. The Wave (originally called La Ola in Spanish) is another massively ambitious, audacious, vivid modern musical daring to sing \u0026 dance to songs about uncomfortable topics and challenging conversations. Lelio's The Wave is inspired by the 2018 feminist protests at major universities in Chile that year, which were part of the global #MeToo movement (just before the pandemic arrived). It's a story about one young woman named Julia, though it's also a story about all women and how misogyny still rules in this patriarchal society. It's an empowering movie about women standing up, fighting back, and never giving up until there is change. A magnificent creation! This shook me up \u0026 left me in awe. La Ola is the latest feature directed by successful Chilean filmmaker Sebastián Lelio – best known as the director of the acclaimed films Gloria (and its remake Gloria Bell), A Fantastic Woman, Disobedience, […]",

He wanted the desert to be more than a backdrop - he wanted it to be a character in the story.\" Every day is a good day to talk about Lawrence of Arabia. The 1962 all-timer masterpiece directed by David Lean is a must watch on the big screen if it ever plays near you – for all the reasons explained in here and more. Filmmaker Sareesh Sudhakaran (who is \"wolfcrow\" on YT) has put together this simple 8-minute video essay examining why Lean's Lawrence of Arabia still looks so good so magnificent all of these years later (60+ years now and it still looks like \"a billion bucks\"!). \"If you're a fan of epic storytelling and stunning cinematography, you won't want to miss this exploration of why Lawrence of Arabia looks the way it does.\" He focuses on the film's iconic desert cinematography, shot by DP Freddie Young using 65mm film stock and exceptional lenses \u0026 cameras - filming for an entire year. And yep, it set the standard for how truly epic movies can look. One of his interesting observations is how they frame characters alone when they're arguing, […]",
