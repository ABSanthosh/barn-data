Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

Read the full article on AICN Found footage horror. Do you love it? Do you hate it? Do you think it is its own genre or do you lump it in with its overarching tone - slasher, supernatural, monster, etc. Love it or hate it, the convention is here to stay, as it offers a realistic, relatable approach to horror that blurs the lines between reality, film, empathy, and voyeurism.   So, when I got an email asking if I wanted to screen the feature DEVON, written and directed by Jenni “JWoww” Farley, I said “of course I do!” My wife is a fan of “Jersey Shore” and has been since day one, so I mostly did it for her, but I was also very curious what the singular star would bring to the horror pantheon. The logline read:   Devon's parents never stopped searching for answers after her disappearance from a notorious asylum. Years after the incident, a mysterious website draws five adventurers to the abandoned asylum where she was last seen. Armed with cameras, they plunge into the darkness, unaware they’re filming their own descent into horror—never meant to return.     I got the chance to chat with writer/director/producer Jenni “JWoww” Farley about jumping into a feature-length film, the serendipitous location, and her crew.      Eric McClanahan: Hey, Jenni! How are you?   Jenni “JWoww” Farley: Good. Nervous.    EM: Nervous? Why are you nervous?   JJF: I feel like this is [me] kind of starting my career over. It’s a different world, a different element. I am a superfan of horror films; I have been since I Finish the article on AICN",

It's set for a release in 2025 on a roadshow tour in theaters in Japan, and hopefully in theaters in the US (but nothing announced yet). No plot details are known yet, but it's made by the director of Redline and the \"World Record\" segment of The Animatrix. A longer version of the trailer is being shown at 45th anniversary screenings of Lupin the 3rd: Castle of Cagliostro (1979) - the anime classic directed by Hayao Miyazaki as his very first feature film. This one also listed as Lupin the IIIrd: The Movie (with a final title still TBA) and stars the voices of Kanichi Kurita as Lupin III, Akio Otsuka as Daisuke Jigen, Daisuke Namikawa as Goemon Ishikawa, Miyuki Sawashiro as Fujiko Mine, Koichi Yamadera as Inspector Zenigata. It is also the first time in 30 years there's been a new 2D animated Lupin the Third movie headed to theaters in Japan since Lupin the Third: Dead or Alive (1996). Not much footage to see yet - […]",

This fascinating animated short film called Freedom River is originally from 1971. A full 53 years later (!!) and everything it talks about is happening right now - the river of freedom is murky \u0026 poisonous, and most Americans don't seem to get it... Freedom River is a \"parable told by Orson Welles.\" The maestro lent his voice to this project after the producers convinced him by sending a script \u0026 recorder in the mail to him in Paris. It's a parable about America – obviously this \"river of freedom\" is referring to the USA – and how xenophobia, racism, and greed will cause that river to become tainted and toxic. \"They could not see it. For their pride made them blind.\" Kind of amazing how accurately this film predicts what is happening to America right now, and how relevant it is even 50+ years later.
