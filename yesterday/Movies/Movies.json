    "description": "HIPPO'S Writer/Director Mark Rapaport Chats Video Games, Sex Talks, and Black-and-White Filmmaking Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends! Barbarella here to talk about dark comedy Hippo, or more accurately to share the conversation I had with Hippo’s director and writer Mark Rapaport. Genuinely funny, this incredible film has the potential to achieve cult status, so long as people take a chance on this black-and-white gem and actually see it. I recommend that they do. Hippo stars Kimball Farley, Lilla Kizlinger, Eliza Roberts, and Eric Roberts as the narrator. It tells the story of two exceptionally different teens being raised by their mother in a somewhat isolated existence. At times, it reminds me of Yorgos Lanthimos’ Dogtooth, in the way that the children in Hippo are sheltered, while not in the same extreme way they were in the Greek film, both films make strong points about the detriment of isolation. The two would make a great double-feature, but if you want to jump on this one first, Hippo will be in select theaters November 8.  At any rate, after a night of minimal sleep due to staying out late at the Pink concert, I caught up with Mark Rapaport, and we had a fun chat about the movie. Check it out! Barbara: Why go black and white with this?  Mark: I've always loved classic movies, but I never thought I would make a movie in black and white until my cinematographer started taking photos of black and white, and I was like, “These are so cool and good, why don't more people shoot in black and white? Maybe we should do something like that.” He was very into that. When Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN ‘Tis the season, for a few more hours, before Mariah Carey breaks through her ice-cocoon and heralds in the winter holidays. If you need a couple of thrillers to hold back the tide of the inevitable, I’ve got you covered with a couple of brand new features released this very month: HOLD YOUR BREATH and DIE ALONE.   DIE ALONE stars Carrie-Anne Moss (THE MATRIX, “The Acolyte”), Frank Grillo (CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, ONE DAY AS A LION), Douglas Smith (HBO’s “Big Love”), and Kimberly-Sue Murray (Netflix’s “V-Wars”). The film is written and directed by Lowell Dean (WOLFCOP, SUPERGRID) and released by Quiver Distribution. After an outbreak turns the majority of the population into plant-based zombies, a young man (Smith) with amnesia searches for his lost love and stumbles across a rugged survivalist (Moss). Check out the trailer:     If you’re getting “The Last of Us” vibes, you’re on the right track. The film features some pretty great creature effects, apt desolation to sell the apocalypse, and a surprisingly original story. Moss is the star of the show, by far, and carries her scenes with a deadpan humor that keeps the heavy subject matter from swallowing the viewer in despair. The budget limitations are clear but the film that emerges is certainly a smart, fun ride that hits all the points of an apocalyptic thriller with a (predictable) plot twist and great performances.   I got the chance to chat with Carrie-Anne Moss about the production of the film, her bicycle-riding skills, and dream roles.

    "description": "\"He's going too far.\" It's never enough for athletes! Always more, more, more. Paramount has revealed an official trailer for a fascinating sports documentary called Freediver, from director Michael John Warren. While this come across as a one-of-a-kind creation, this whole film seems like a response to the exceptional doc The Deepest Breath about two other famous freedivers - mainly a young Italian woman named Alessia Zecchini who was also setting records. Anyway... After geopolitics forced him into exile, one of the greatest living freedivers, Alexey Molchanov, fights to reclaim his athletic glory and honor his iconic mother's towering legacy by attempting a record setting season in the history of this deadly sport. His near-suicidal quest to set five world records in under four months brings him to the farthest reaches of the globe and his mind, forcing him to reevaluate the very skills on which he has built his entire life. Intense! This is such a scary yet beautiful sport only a few people in the world can really compete in – don't try this at home, folks. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Michael John Warren's doc Freediver, direct from YouTube: After geopolitics forced him into exile, […]",

    "description": "\"You might be missing your chance to win this war.\" FX on Hulu has debuted a second trailer for the series Say Nothing, set in Belfast during the infamous The Troubles period. It's out for streaming this week in the US. This historical drama limited series is created by Josh Zetumer for Disney+ and it's produced by FX Productions. Detailing four generations in Northern Ireland during The Troubles, it is an adaptation of the book Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland by Patrick Radden Keefe. The series follows the lives of people growing up in Belfast in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Starring Lola Petticrew, Hazel Doupe, Anthony Boyle, Josh Finan, and Maxine Peake. For another great film about Belfast, Ireland, I highly recommend watching Kneecap also from this year. This series seems to be more about how a divided nation is bad and hurting each other is bad, but I'm not sure which side it will into regarding the actual politics. Is it pro-Crown or pro-Ireland? Or it's just pro-people? What do you think from this footage? Here's the second official trailer for FX's The Troubles series Say Nothing, direct from YouTube: You […]",
