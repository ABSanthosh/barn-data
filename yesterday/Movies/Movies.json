    "description": "HIPPO'S Writer/Director Mark Rapaport Chats Video Games, Sex Talks, and Black-and-White Filmmaking Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends! Barbarella here to talk about dark comedy Hippo, or more accurately to share the conversation I had with Hippo’s director and writer Mark Rapaport. Genuinely funny, this incredible film has the potential to achieve cult status, so long as people take a chance on this black-and-white gem and actually see it. I recommend that they do. Hippo stars Kimball Farley, Lilla Kizlinger, Eliza Roberts, and Eric Roberts as the narrator. It tells the story of two exceptionally different teens being raised by their mother in a somewhat isolated existence. At times, it reminds me of Yorgos Lanthimos’ Dogtooth, in the way that the children in Hippo are sheltered, while not in the same extreme way they were in the Greek film, both films make strong points about the detriment of isolation. The two would make a great double-feature, but if you want to jump on this one first, Hippo will be in select theaters November 8.  At any rate, after a night of minimal sleep due to staying out late at the Pink concert, I caught up with Mark Rapaport, and we had a fun chat about the movie. Check it out! Barbara: Why go black and white with this?  Mark: I've always loved classic movies, but I never thought I would make a movie in black and white until my cinematographer started taking photos of black and white, and I was like, “These are so cool and good, why don't more people shoot in black and white? Maybe we should do something like that.” He was very into that. When Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN ‘Tis the season, for a few more hours, before Mariah Carey breaks through her ice-cocoon and heralds in the winter holidays. If you need a couple of thrillers to hold back the tide of the inevitable, I’ve got you covered with a couple of brand new features released this very month: HOLD YOUR BREATH and DIE ALONE.   DIE ALONE stars Carrie-Anne Moss (THE MATRIX, “The Acolyte”), Frank Grillo (CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, ONE DAY AS A LION), Douglas Smith (HBO’s “Big Love”), and Kimberly-Sue Murray (Netflix’s “V-Wars”). The film is written and directed by Lowell Dean (WOLFCOP, SUPERGRID) and released by Quiver Distribution. After an outbreak turns the majority of the population into plant-based zombies, a young man (Smith) with amnesia searches for his lost love and stumbles across a rugged survivalist (Moss). Check out the trailer:     If you’re getting “The Last of Us” vibes, you’re on the right track. The film features some pretty great creature effects, apt desolation to sell the apocalypse, and a surprisingly original story. Moss is the star of the show, by far, and carries her scenes with a deadpan humor that keeps the heavy subject matter from swallowing the viewer in despair. The budget limitations are clear but the film that emerges is certainly a smart, fun ride that hits all the points of an apocalyptic thriller with a (predictable) plot twist and great performances.   I got the chance to chat with Carrie-Anne Moss about the production of the film, her bicycle-riding skills, and dream roles.

He's best known for his earlier work - directing the films Central Station, The Motorcycle Diaries, Dark Water, On the Road. The film tells a true story about a Brazilian family whose father is taken by the government \u0026 never seen again. Set in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1971 - a country in the tightening grip of a military dictatorship. A mother is forced to reinvent herself when her family's life is shattered by a heinous act. The lives of Eunice Paiva and her five children abruptly change after the disappearance of her husband – former Brazilian Labour Party congressman Rubens Paiva. The film stars Fernanda Torres as Eunice, Selton Mello, and Fernanda Montenegro. This first premiered at the Venice Film Festival, and after playing at tons of other festivals, it was selected by Brazil as their entry for Best International Film.

    "description": "\"Those delinquents hot-wired a carnival ride the other night.\" Hulu has revealed an fun trailer for a holiday comedy called Nutcrackers, the newest comedy directed by David Gordon Green. He spent a long time making his Halloween trilogy, but it's good to see him back directing more lively \u0026 funny films like he used to (Pineapple Express, Your Highness, Prince Avalanche, Manglehorn). Nutcrackers premiered at TIFF a few months ago and is opening direct-to-streaming on Hulu at the end of November in time for the holiday season. DGG's Nutcrackers follows strait-laced and work obsessed Mike as he is suddenly thrust into being a caregiver for his rambunctious, orphaned nephews. In the most unlikely of places, 4 siblings find a loving shelter in an unexpected turn of circumstances. This endearing dramedy draws inspiration from actual events and deftly crafts a gripping story that unites everyone. Starring Ben Stiller, Linda Cardellini, Edi Patterson, Tim Heidecker, Toby Huss, Homer Janson, Ulysses Janson, Arlo Janson, and Atlas Janson. This looks kooky and funny, with a few amusing laughs, but it's a story we've seen so many times. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for David Gordon Green's film Nutcrackers, direct from YouTube: Hotshot Chicago […]",
