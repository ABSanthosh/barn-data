James Gunn, writer and director of the wonderful “The Suicide Squad” (the one with Idris Elba and John Cena, not the one with Will Smith) and all three excellent “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies. Is it any good? Like much of Gunn’s prior work, it’s funny and moving and exciting, and never boring. There’s plenty to nitpick, but you’d be a fool to miss this very entertaining entertainment. What says Warner Bros.? “Superman embarks on a journey to reconcile his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing as Clark Kent.” How does it start? As John Williams’ Superman theme plays, a lot of text catches us up us what happened. 300 years ago (superhumans became public knowledge on Earth), 30 years ago (an alien spacecraft crashed into Kansas), 3 years ago (a new superhuman arrived in Metropolis), 3 weeks ago (a superhuman interfered in a middle-eastern conflict), 3 hours ago (another new superhuman, one billing himself as The Hammer of Borovia, arrived in Metropolis), and 3 minutes ago (Superman loses a brawl for the first time ever).* Then we see what a lot of fans have already seen in that famous clip: a bloodied and beaten Superman crash-lands in a field of snow, then summons Krypto to take him home.)

    "description": "Barbarella Finds MATERIALISTS Pointless Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here to tell you how completely disappointing Materialists is. How can a movie where Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vie for the affections of a matchmaker fail so badly? Well, let me tell you.  For starters, the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and either romantic rival doesn't quite feel like it's intense enough, so perhaps the casting has some impact, but I don't think that's the issue. I think the script deserves the blame. Don't get me wrong. The story includes lots of laughable moments around dating expectations and so forth. However, one expects characters to evolve throughout a story, to learn lessons, gain deeper understanding or just grow into better people through interactions with others or situations in which they find themselves. None of this happens. So much of the story just makes no sense.   For instance, we are led to believe that Lucy, who’s been a top matchmaker for quite some time, never knew that people in real life are sometimes different than they appear on paper. She only learns this when an incident occurs with one of the couples she matches. I mean, anyone who’s ever been on a dating site or watched a True Crime story should know that people can portray themselves as something that they’re not. Technically, she apparently does already know people lie on the questionnaire because she comments about guys lying about their height.  For her to apparently have this “revelation” that makes her reevaluate her priorities simply doesn’t track. While that bothers me Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"I came here to be with you...\" An international trailer is out for the provocative new film from acclaimed Mexican filmmaker Michel Franco, who's on a roll with prickly films nearly every year. Recently he made Memory with Jessica Chastain and now he's back with another new project with her. Dreams premiered at the 2025 Berlin Film Festival and is next playing at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival now in Czechia, which is where this trailer is from - though it's entirely with English dialogue. Fernando, a young ballet dancer from Mexico, dreams of international fame. Believing his lover Jennifer, a wealthy socialite \u0026 philanthropist, will support him, he leaves everything behind \u0026 narrowly escapes death while crossing the border. His arrival, however, disrupts Jennifer's carefully curated world. She will do anything to protect their future together – and the life she has built for herself. Featuring Jessica Chastain and Isaac Hernández, with Rupert Friend, Marshall Bell, Eligio Meléndez, \u0026 Mercedes Hernández. Luckily I've already seen the film (at Berlinale) and it's quite good, definitely stirs up strong feelings in everyone. Franco is making a strong point here and I respect him for what he's saying with Dreams. Still no […]",

    "description": "Trains is \"a collective portrait of people in 20th century Europe, capturing their hopes, desires, dramas, and tragedies.\" One of my favorite parts about the Karlovy Vary Film Festival held in Czechia is that I sometimes get to walk in and watch some particularly obscure, one-of-a-kind, extremely niche films. This year's intriguing one-of-a-kind discovery is a Polish documentary film titled Trains, also known as Pociagi in Polish, made by Polish filmmaker Maciej Drygas. Years ago at KVIFF (as the festival is known), I caught a documentary film titled simply Star (more info on the film here). The mesmerizing doc is entirely made up of nothing but shots of only the stars borrowed from hundreds movies throughout cinema history. It was a breathtaking cinematic experience, entirely unique, and I knew the minute it was over that I would never be able to find this film again. Trains is similar - it's another breathtaking cinematic experience, made up of nothing but shots of train footage from the beginning of the 20th century. However, I came out of the film at KVIFF this year more depressed than I did emerging from Star years ago – because it's about the Holocaust. As a lover […]",
