    "description": "Barbarella Finds MATERIALISTS Pointless Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here to tell you how completely disappointing Materialists is. How can a movie where Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vie for the affections of a matchmaker fail so badly? Well, let me tell you.  For starters, the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and either romantic rival doesn't quite feel like it's intense enough, so perhaps the casting has some impact, but I don't think that's the issue. I think the script deserves the blame. Don't get me wrong. The story includes lots of laughable moments around dating expectations and so forth. However, one expects characters to evolve throughout a story, to learn lessons, gain deeper understanding or just grow into better people through interactions with others or situations in which they find themselves. None of this happens. So much of the story just makes no sense.   For instance, we are led to believe that Lucy, who’s been a top matchmaker for quite some time, never knew that people in real life are sometimes different than they appear on paper. She only learns this when an incident occurs with one of the couples she matches. I mean, anyone who’s ever been on a dating site or watched a True Crime story should know that people can portray themselves as something that they’re not. Technically, she apparently does already know people lie on the questionnaire because she comments about guys lying about their height.  For her to apparently have this “revelation” that makes her reevaluate her priorities simply doesn’t track. While that bothers me Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Barbarella Adores THE LIFE OF CHUCK Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here. Have I ever told you what a huge Stephen King fan I am? It started when a teenage me read Pet Sematary and became so enthralled with the author’s work that my mom’s Christmas shopping became immensely easier. She started gifting me Stephen King books for every Christmas and birthday thereafter, knowing I would eagerly devour every page. I did, with relish. Eventually, I began working my way through movies based on his works. Some ventured from the source material in ways I didn’t appreciate, but when I heard Mike Flanagan would be tackling one of King’s short stories, The Life of Chuck, I knew I’d love it. And I did. Mike Flanagan, who’s responsible for my favorite horror miniseries, The Haunting of Hill House, and who was the mastermind who brought Doctor Sleep to screens, remains incredibly faithful to the source material, including how it’s told in three acts using reverse chronology. It’s a film that offers a feast of reflection on life, but I suspect some will dig in more ravenously than others. This is a story about those magical moments in life, the influence others have on our lives, and the decisions we make day to day that steer us one way or another.  Narrated by Nick Offerman, the film begins ominously enough, with the world seemingly coming to an end. Natural and unnatural disasters plague the planet, and as if that’s not bad enough, the internet also appears to be out, possibly for good this time.

    "description": "\"With truth, we're building new politics in Brazil.\" Netflix has revealed a trailer for the documentary film titled Apocalypse in the Tropics, the official follow-up film from Petra Costa after making The Edge of Democracy back in 2019 (also excellent). She continues to film \u0026 follow Brazilian politics into an extremely tumultuous time when the right wing jackass Jair Bolsonaro is president and the chaos with everyone in the country. When does a democracy end, and theocracy begin? the film wonders. Costa's Apocalypse in the Tropics investigates the increasingly powerful grip that evangelical Christian leaders hold over politics in Brazil. Weaving together past \u0026 present, the film holds a mirror up to the rest of the world. With the savage clarity that defined her last film, Costa documents a time of kaleidoscopic confusion and fear with intimate observational filmmaking that braids together the personal, the historic and the mythic. As faith shifts from private refuge to public battleground, Brazil holds a mirror to a world where democracies are being ruined by the power of prophecy. It'll be streaming on Netflix worldwide later in July this summer. A must see for anyone who wants a glimpse into the utter insanity of […]",

    "description": "\"I feel like I don't fit...\" Lionsgate has revealed an official trailer for a coming-of-age film titled I Wish You All The Best, arriving in theaters this November. It premiered at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival last year, and is based on the novel of the same name written by Mason Deaver. Described as a \"sweetly funny journey of self-discovery that celebrates the power of being true to yourself\" and is the feature directorial debut of actor Tommy Dorfman. The film follows Ben DeBacker, a non-binary teen who is thrown out of their house and forced to move in with their estranged older sister, Hannah, and her husband, Thomas. Struggling with anxiety, they come out only to Hannah, Thomas, and their art teacher, Ms. Lyons, while trying to keep a low profile at their new school. Ben's attempts to survive junior year unnoticed are thwarted when Nathan, a funny \u0026 charismatic student, decides to take Ben under his wing. Starring Corey Fogelmanis as Ben, with Alexandra Daddario, Cole Sprouse, Miles Gutierrez-Riley, Amy Landecker, and Lena Dunham as Ms. Lyons. This definitely looks sweet and charming, with some good reviews far. Opening later this year. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) […]",
