    "description": "Barbarella Dives into Conversation with FREEDIVER Director Michael John Warren! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here. Michael John Warren’s latest documentary Freediver is available on Prime Video, or buy or rent on Digital starting December 7, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov’s unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving’s impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death.  Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like “How long could I hold my breath?” - the answer is not long at all - or “Would I ever consider free diving?” The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both! Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience.

Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

    "description": "\"It's showtime, folks!\" Columbia Pictures celebrated its 100th birthday in 2024. As the year comes to an end, Sony Pictures (who now owns Columbia) released a tribute video celebrating the movie studios' 100 years. \"For our 100th birthday, we celebrate you.\" The video features various filmmakers, actors, and many other workers at Columbia talking about why they love Columbia movies, some of their favorite movies and moments, and the legacy of the studio. Disney and Warner Bros celebrated their 100th birthday last year, as both of these studios were founded in 1923. Columbia Pictures, at least this iconic Hollywood name, was created in 1924 by Harry \u0026 Jack Cohn and Joe Brandt (originally called Cohn-Brandt-Cohn CBC Film Sales Corporation until they changed this name in Jan 1924). Columbia's most commercially successful franchises include Spider-Man, Jumanji, Bad Boys, Men in Black, The Karate Kid, Robert Langdon, \u0026 Ghostbusters, and the studio's highest-grossing movie worldwide is Spider-Man: No Way Home earning $1.92 billion. The last time they won Best Picture was for 1987's The Last Emperor. Enjoy this warm-hearted tribute below. If you're looking for more to watch, they released this live-stream with 100 trailers from 100 years right here. \"That lady […]",

    "description": "This isn't your typical stalker horror. It's something else. A freaky new teaser trailer has debuted for an indie horror thriller called Stalker made by French filmmaker David Cholewa. This 20 minute horror short has played a few small film festivals already but has not been released online yet. A young woman must confront her deepest fears if she hopes to survive the night. As she walks back home on a gloomy, threatening Paris night, she can't shake the feeling that she's being followed. As she gets closer to her residence, the presence becomes more and more bold and aggressive. And it is only by confronting her deepest inner fears that she can survive this ominous threat. This weird stalker looks like a giant spider which is scary as hell! Sandra Hohenadel stars as Sarah. Get a look at footage below and keep an eye out for this short dropping online. That shot of whatever is coming out of her mouth is gross. An effective, unsettling teaser for a horror short. Here's the teaser trailers (+ posters) for David Cholewa's horror short Stalker, direct from YouTube: Thanks to ScreenAnarchy for the tip on this. After a vicious assault at a […]",
