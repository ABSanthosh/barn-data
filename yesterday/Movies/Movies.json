    "description": "Hercules loves Superman 2025 Read the full article on AICN Superman 2025 FAQ I am – Hercules!! What’s it called? “Superman.” Who’s responsible? James Gunn, writer and director of the wonderful “The Suicide Squad” (the one with Idris Elba and John Cena, not the one with Will Smith) and all three excellent “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies. Is it any good? Like much of Gunn’s prior work, it’s funny and moving and exciting, and never boring. There’s plenty to nitpick, but you’d be a fool to miss this very entertaining entertainment. What says Warner Bros.? “Superman embarks on a journey to reconcile his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing as Clark Kent.” How does it start? As John Williams’ Superman theme plays, a lot of text catches us up on what happened: 300 years ago superhumans became public knowledge on Earth, 30 years ago an alien spacecraft crashed into Kansas, 3 years ago a new superhuman arrived in Metropolis, 3 weeks ago a superhuman interfered in a middle-eastern conflict, 3 hours ago another new superhuman, one billing himself as The Hammer of Borovia, arrived in Metropolis, and 3 minutes ago Superman loses a brawl for the first time ever).* Then we see what a lot of fans have already seen in that famous clip: a bloodied and beaten Superman crash-lands in a field of snow, then summons Krypto to take him home. (*It is NOT mentioned in this exposition dump that Lois and Clark became romantically involved 3 months ago.) The Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Barbarella Finds MATERIALISTS Pointless Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here to tell you how completely disappointing Materialists is. How can a movie where Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vie for the affections of a matchmaker fail so badly? Well, let me tell you.  For starters, the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and either romantic rival doesn't quite feel like it's intense enough, so perhaps the casting has some impact, but I don't think that's the issue. I think the script deserves the blame. Don't get me wrong. The story includes lots of laughable moments around dating expectations and so forth. However, one expects characters to evolve throughout a story, to learn lessons, gain deeper understanding or just grow into better people through interactions with others or situations in which they find themselves. None of this happens. So much of the story just makes no sense.   For instance, we are led to believe that Lucy, who’s been a top matchmaker for quite some time, never knew that people in real life are sometimes different than they appear on paper. She only learns this when an incident occurs with one of the couples she matches. I mean, anyone who’s ever been on a dating site or watched a True Crime story should know that people can portray themselves as something that they’re not. Technically, she apparently does already know people lie on the questionnaire because she comments about guys lying about their height.  For her to apparently have this “revelation” that makes her reevaluate her priorities simply doesn’t track. While that bothers me Finish the article on AICN",

Look no further than Picturehouse's five-screen cinema in Crouch End.\" 📽 One of the best cinema chains in the UK is called Picturehouse - based mainly in/around London, they also have cinemas in a few other cities as well. They're one of the best in terms of quality and theatrical experience (I recommend going to the Picturehouse Central in Soho - one of my favorite theaters in the world). The official Picturehouse YouTube posted a series of 5 video tours inside of 5 of their cinemas: the Regal Picturehouse at Henley, City Screen York, Epsom Square, Crouch End, \u0026 Ealing Picturehouse. The videos were created to promote the venues for use in events \u0026 meetings. They want to get more people not in cinema to rent them. Or you can rent one of the screens and throw a private movie night for your friends \u0026 family. 🍿 Because I'm still a movie theater nerd, and FS has always been about hyping up the theatrical experience, I'm featuring all the videos below anyway.

We have to bring her down...\" Prime Video has revealed an official trailer for Butterfly, a spy thriller series arriving to watch starting this September. This streaming series is based on the graphic novel by Arash Amel, and also produced by The Amel Company, along with Amazon Studios, Boom! Studios, and 3AD. \"Second chances don't come twice.\" \"They share a past, now they share a mission.\" Daniel Dae Kim stars as David Jung, an enigmatic, highly unpredictable former US intelligence operative living in South Korea. When the consequences of an impossible decision from his past come back to haunt him, and he finds himself pursued by Rebecca (and her organization Caddis) – a deadly, sociopathic young agent assigned to kill him. The cast includes Reina Hardesty as Rebecca, Piper Perabo as the boss, with Kim Ji-hoon, Park Hae-soo, Kim Tae-hee, Charles Parnell, Sean Dulake, and Nayoon Kim. Plus Sung Dong-il and Lee Il-hwa in guest roles. It's basically a Korean action series about spies – but made mostly in English for US audiences to enjoy as well. It looks entertaining \u0026 quite similar to Netflix's FUBAR. Here's the main official trailer (+ poster) […]",
