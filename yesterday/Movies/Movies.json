    "description": "Snake Plotzkin Reviews THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF CHRISTOPHER LEE Read the full article on AICN Snake Plotzkin, reporting from Fantastic Fest 2024, where I got to see the biographical documentary, The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee. I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing.  If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015). Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor Finish the article on AICN",

Barbarella here. Strange Harvest: The Occult Murder in the Inland Empire is a long title for a great narrative utilizing the true-crime documentary format. The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking I’m watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, it’s only a movie.  It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, and I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out! Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff. Peter: Bless You.  Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that.  Stuart: Thank you.   Barbara: Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for?  Stuart: I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

The Vanishing is an 8 episode mini-series continuation of the Goosebumps series from last year - created by filmmakers Rob Letterman and Nicholas Stoller; based on R. L. Stine's books of the same name. Schwimmer stars as Anthony Brewer, a former botany professor who gets infected. \"After his brother went missing with a group of kids in 1994, who local teens believe 'were killed by ghosts,' Anthony looks into evidence from the scene, which infects him with a mysterious symbiotic organism.\" It also follows the twins Cece \u0026 Devin and their friends who also find themselves entangled in the chilling tale of four teens who vanished in 1994. The cast includes Ana Ortiz, Jayden Bartels, Sam McCarthy, Elijah M. Cooper, Francesca Noel, and Galilea La Salvia.

K5 Intl. has revealed a first look teaser trailer for a biopic film called Ravens from Japan, made by a British filmmaker named Mark Gill (his second feature after England is Mine). The film is premiering at the 2024 Austin Film Festival underway right now – which is this teaser it out to view. The film is a dark fantasy love story about the legendary Japanese photographer Masahisa Fukase and his wife Yoko. This rockin' new biopic stars legendary Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano, who totally ruled the role of Kashigi Yabushige in the \"Shogun\" series on FX, as the lead character Masahisa Fukase. The cast also includes Kumi Takiuchi as Yoko, Sôsuke Ikematsu, Kanji Furutachi, and Gô Jibiki. After this premiere, it will open in Japan in early 2025 - so expect more updates on the full US release sometime next year. This does look like an intriguing photographer biopic with some trippy vibes as its set in the 1970s with lots of wild partying. He also seemed to be haunted by ravens? Very interesting.
