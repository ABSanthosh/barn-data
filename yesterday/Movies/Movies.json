    "description": "Snake Plotzkin Reviews THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF CHRISTOPHER LEE Read the full article on AICN Snake Plotzkin, reporting from Fantastic Fest 2024, where I got to see the biographical documentary, The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee. I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing.  If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015). Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor Finish the article on AICN",

Barbarella here. Strange Harvest: The Occult Murder in the Inland Empire is a long title for a great narrative utilizing the true-crime documentary format. The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking I’m watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, it’s only a movie.  It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, and I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out! Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff. Peter: Bless You.  Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that.  Stuart: Thank you.   Barbara: Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for?  Stuart: I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

    "description": "\"You cannot tell anyone about us!\" Netflix has unveiled an official trailer for yet another holiday romantic comedy out this season, this one titled Our Little Secret. Oh, how cute! Wait, what is the little secret? A crossover of old lovers end up at the same home for the holidays. 🎄 Here's the pitch: Two resentful exes are forced to spend Christmas under the same roof after discovering that their current partners are siblings. It sounds exactly like the kind of movie many folks will avoid, while some will be ready to watch it right away. Lindsay Lohan stars as Avery, with a funny comedy cast including Ian Harding, Tim Meadows, Jon Rudnitsky, Henry Czerny, Judy Reyes, Chris Parnell, and Kristin Chenoweth. Right in the middle of Our Little Secret is Erica Morgan, played by Chenoweth, the matriarch of all this yuletide mess. \"There's a lot of surprise family 6-degrees-of-separation issues ahead, which is fun to play.\" Netflix also put out trailers this week for Hallmark-esque holiday romcoms Hot Frosty and The Merry Gentlemen.

    "description": "\"This is about our freedom, our families!\" Altitude Films has revealed the first trailer for the film William Tell, an epic new look at this iconic fictional character. It just premiered at the 2024 Toronto Film Festival last month to mostly mixed reviews, and it's set for a UK release in January. Though no US release has been set. As the nations of medieval Europe struggle for power, the ruthless Austrian Empire invades neighboring Switzerland, and a peaceful huntsman, William Tell, is thrust into the heart of their resistance. The story unfolds in the 14th Century amidst the days of the Holy Roman Empire where Europe's nations fiercely vie for supremacy and the ambitious Austrians, desiring more land, encroach upon Switzerland, a serene and pastoral nation. TIFF says it is \"full of bravery, honour, and some dazzling battles, this big-screen version of the legendary hero’s tale is pure pleasure to watch. William Tell may or may not have existed in real life, but his story is so irresistible that it has become the origin story of Switzerland.\" Claes Bang stars as William Tell, in a cast including Connor Swindells, Golshifteh Farahani, Jonah Hauer-King, Ellie Bamber, Rafe Spall, Emily Beecham, Jonathan […]",
