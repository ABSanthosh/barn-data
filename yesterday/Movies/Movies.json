    "description": "There he is! The \"Master of Suspense\" hiding in plain sight. Can you identify all of his cameos? Do you know where he is in every one of his own films? Time for something a bit fun this year - enjoy this supercut video collecting every single Alfred Hitchcock cameo. There's a grand total of 40 of them! Spanning from 1927 to 1976 and in both B\u0026W and color across his entire filmography. Wikipedia explains: \"English film director Alfred Hitchcock made cameo appearances in 40 of his films. They began during production of The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog when an actor failed to show up, and the director filled in for him.\" There are obviously some more iconic and unforgettable cameos, like the one where he gets on the train with a cello in Strangers on a Train (1951), or the one where he gives actress Jane Wyman a look in Stage Fright (1950) - seen in the image above. It's a fun look back at cinema history and Hitchcock's kooky comedic sensibilities. Thanks to OpenCulture for the tip. The video was edited and posted by YT user named Morgan T. Rhys - you can view the […]",

    "description": "\"Our patients don't need doctors. Our patients need detectives.\" What about - someone who is both?! CBS has unveiled an official trailer for a series called Watson, a primetime TV series on CBS and also streaming Paramount+ in January 2025. It's yet another new Sherlock Holmes inspired / connected series, this time introducing the actor Morris Chestnut starring as Dr. John Watson. Watson is another medical mystery series starring Chestnut and it will premiere after the AFC Championship Game on Sunday in January. One year after Holmes's apparent death at the hands of his archenemy Moriarty, Dr. Watson sets up shop at a clinic for the treatment of rare and unusual diseases, in Pittsburgh. Soon however, he must face his past when Moriarty emerges to do battle once more. The cast stars Chestnut as Watson, a physician and former consulting detective who heads the Holmes Clinic in Pittsburgh, PA; Eve Harlow as Ingrid Derian, an aloof but highly skilled neurologist with an enigmatic past; Peter Mark Kendall as Stephens Croft and Adam Croft, identical twin brothers; Inga Schlingmann; Ritchie Coster; Rochelle Aytes. So this is basically \"House\" all over again but also mashed up with Sherlock Holmes? Sure why not, […]",

Read the full article on AICN Found footage horror. Do you love it? Do you hate it? Do you think it is its own genre or do you lump it in with its overarching tone - slasher, supernatural, monster, etc. Love it or hate it, the convention is here to stay, as it offers a realistic, relatable approach to horror that blurs the lines between reality, film, empathy, and voyeurism.   So, when I got an email asking if I wanted to screen the feature DEVON, written and directed by Jenni “JWoww” Farley, I said “of course I do!” My wife is a fan of “Jersey Shore” and has been since day one, so I mostly did it for her, but I was also very curious what the singular star would bring to the horror pantheon. The logline read:   Devon's parents never stopped searching for answers after her disappearance from a notorious asylum. Years after the incident, a mysterious website draws five adventurers to the abandoned asylum where she was last seen. Armed with cameras, they plunge into the darkness, unaware they’re filming their own descent into horror—never meant to return.     I got the chance to chat with writer/director/producer Jenni “JWoww” Farley about jumping into a feature-length film, the serendipitous location, and her crew.      Eric McClanahan: Hey, Jenni! How are you?   Jenni “JWoww” Farley: Good. Nervous.    EM: Nervous? Why are you nervous?   JJF: I feel like this is [me] kind of starting my career over. It’s a different world, a different element. I am a superfan of horror films; I have been since I Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "HIPPO'S Writer/Director Mark Rapaport Chats Video Games, Sex Talks, and Black-and-White Filmmaking Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends! Barbarella here to talk about dark comedy Hippo, or more accurately to share the conversation I had with Hippo’s director and writer Mark Rapaport. Genuinely funny, this incredible film has the potential to achieve cult status, so long as people take a chance on this black-and-white gem and actually see it. I recommend that they do. Hippo stars Kimball Farley, Lilla Kizlinger, Eliza Roberts, and Eric Roberts as the narrator. It tells the story of two exceptionally different teens being raised by their mother in a somewhat isolated existence. At times, it reminds me of Yorgos Lanthimos’ Dogtooth, in the way that the children in Hippo are sheltered, while not in the same extreme way they were in the Greek film, both films make strong points about the detriment of isolation. The two would make a great double-feature, but if you want to jump on this one first, Hippo will be in select theaters November 8.  At any rate, after a night of minimal sleep due to staying out late at the Pink concert, I caught up with Mark Rapaport, and we had a fun chat about the movie. Check it out! Barbara: Why go black and white with this?  Mark: I've always loved classic movies, but I never thought I would make a movie in black and white until my cinematographer started taking photos of black and white, and I was like, “These are so cool and good, why don't more people shoot in black and white? Maybe we should do something like that.” He was very into that. When Finish the article on AICN",
