    "description": "McEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "There comes a point in everyone's life where they have to to learn to grow up a little, and move on from their past relationships. It's not easy, of course. There's always much to think about. But it's the right thing to do. Love, Brooklyn is a film about exactly this moment in the life of a man living in Brooklyn, New York. This delightful and humble film is the feature directorial debut of an impressive, up-and-coming indie filmmaker named Rachael Abigail Holder who's from New York (it's obvious from the way she captures Brooklyn on camera). After directing on many TV series previously, she is making her mark on the indie film scene by directing this lovely little feature - from a screenplay written by Paul Zimmerman. This is such a beautiful discovery, and I had such a warm \u0026 wonderful experience watching this at its world premiere at Sundance. I could feel the buzz and energy in the air, the audience was wrapped up in this story and moved by it as much as I was. That communal experience of falling in love with a film while sitting together is always so touching. Love, Brooklyn stars André Holland […]",

    "description": "\"The world ain't fair. It ain't supposed to be fair... that's how it works.\" Briarcliff Entertainment has finally unveiled an official trailer for Magazine Dreams, the long-delayed film featuring actor Jonathan Majors as a psychotic body builder in LA. This initially premiered back at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival to great reviews (here's mine), and was bought by Searchlight Pictures pretty quickly. But then Majors was arrested and then found guilty for assault and harassment, so they sold off the film and pulled it from the schedule. Briarcliff has picked it up instead years later and is now setting it for a March 2025 release coming soon. An amateur bodybuilder struggles to find any human connection in this exploration of celebrity and violence. Magazine Dreams stars Jonathan Majors as a body builder named Killian Maddox, who is obsessed with winning body sculpting competitions but has nothing else in life. The cast also includes Haley Bennett, Taylour Paige, Mike O'Hearn, Harrison Page, \u0026 Harriet Sansom Harris. Despite Majors' troubles, this is a good film and it should be released anyway – especially as a cautionary tale about vanity and fame. Here's the first official trailer for Elijah Bynum's film Magazine Dreams, direct […]",
