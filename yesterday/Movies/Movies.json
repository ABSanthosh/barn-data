Read the full article on AICN Found footage horror. Do you love it? Do you hate it? Do you think it is its own genre or do you lump it in with its overarching tone - slasher, supernatural, monster, etc. Love it or hate it, the convention is here to stay, as it offers a realistic, relatable approach to horror that blurs the lines between reality, film, empathy, and voyeurism.   So, when I got an email asking if I wanted to screen the feature DEVON, written and directed by Jenni “JWoww” Farley, I said “of course I do!” My wife is a fan of “Jersey Shore” and has been since day one, so I mostly did it for her, but I was also very curious what the singular star would bring to the horror pantheon. The logline read:   Devon's parents never stopped searching for answers after her disappearance from a notorious asylum. Years after the incident, a mysterious website draws five adventurers to the abandoned asylum where she was last seen. Armed with cameras, they plunge into the darkness, unaware they’re filming their own descent into horror—never meant to return.     I got the chance to chat with writer/director/producer Jenni “JWoww” Farley about jumping into a feature-length film, the serendipitous location, and her crew.      Eric McClanahan: Hey, Jenni! How are you?   Jenni “JWoww” Farley: Good. Nervous.    EM: Nervous? Why are you nervous?   JJF: I feel like this is [me] kind of starting my career over. It’s a different world, a different element. I am a superfan of horror films; I have been since I Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "HIPPO'S Writer/Director Mark Rapaport Chats Video Games, Sex Talks, and Black-and-White Filmmaking Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends! Barbarella here to talk about dark comedy Hippo, or more accurately to share the conversation I had with Hippo’s director and writer Mark Rapaport. Genuinely funny, this incredible film has the potential to achieve cult status, so long as people take a chance on this black-and-white gem and actually see it. I recommend that they do. Hippo stars Kimball Farley, Lilla Kizlinger, Eliza Roberts, and Eric Roberts as the narrator. It tells the story of two exceptionally different teens being raised by their mother in a somewhat isolated existence. At times, it reminds me of Yorgos Lanthimos’ Dogtooth, in the way that the children in Hippo are sheltered, while not in the same extreme way they were in the Greek film, both films make strong points about the detriment of isolation. The two would make a great double-feature, but if you want to jump on this one first, Hippo will be in select theaters November 8.  At any rate, after a night of minimal sleep due to staying out late at the Pink concert, I caught up with Mark Rapaport, and we had a fun chat about the movie. Check it out! Barbara: Why go black and white with this?  Mark: I've always loved classic movies, but I never thought I would make a movie in black and white until my cinematographer started taking photos of black and white, and I was like, “These are so cool and good, why don't more people shoot in black and white? Maybe we should do something like that.” He was very into that. When Finish the article on AICN",

Which opens on December 6th in just a few weeks. Tonight is the final 2024 supermoon called the \"Full Beaver Moon\" and if you know any lycanthropes in your neighborhood, you might want to stay indoors (though do take a peek at the moon at some point). One year ago, a Supermoon turned millions into werewolves. This December, it’s happening again. Two scientists try to stop a mutation that turns people into werewolves after a supermoon the year before. This is going to be totally gnarly! A must watch for horror fans! Werewolves features Frank Grillo, Katrina Law, Ilfenesh Hadera, James Michael Cummings, Lou Diamond Phillips. With practical werewolves designed \u0026 built by Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr (known for Alien and Predator FX). The full trailer has better footage but this is a good reminder not to skip this when it opens in theaters soon. Here's the supermoon promo trailer for Steven C.

    "description": "\"You can't change the past, you just have to live in the present.\" Oscope Labs has unveiled an official trailer for an indie documentary creation called The Taste of Mango, made by a Sri Lankan-British filmmaker named Chloe Abrahams as her feature directorial debut. This premiered in 2023 at a few festivals including True/False, London, and Memphis and is finally getting a proper theatrical release in the US this December. The Taste of Mango, the debut feature from filmmaker and video artist Chloe Abrahams, is an enveloping, hypnotic, urgently personal meditation on family, memory, identity, violence, love. At its center are three extraordinary women: the director’s mother, Rozana; her grandmother, Jean; and the director herself. Their stories, by turns difficult and jubilant, testify to the entangled and ever-changing nature of inheritance, and the ways in which we both hurt and protect the ones we love. Featuring Rozana Ross \u0026 Jean Davidson. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Chloe Abrahams' The Taste of Mango, direct from YouTube: A hypnotically cinematic love letter flowing through time and generations. Chloe Abrahams probes raw questions her mother and grandmother have long brushed aside, tenderly untangling painful knots in her family's unspoken past. The […]",
