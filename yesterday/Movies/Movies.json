While we wait for David Ehrlich's annual countdown video (arriving in early January) here's another one looking back at the best of the year. This video countdown is put together by movie lovers Kyle Wilson and Patrick Ryan - featuring their combined picks for the 25 Best Films of 2024. Ready to dive in and find out what their favorites are? It's also an exciting supercut video featuring footage from all 25 movies listed and a few others - as they look back at the year in cinema. There's some excellent editing in this, stringing together clips and bits of dialogue and songs from these films. This is a robust list featuring documentaries, international features, different genres and everything else amazing from 2024. But it looks like Nosferatu didn't make the cut? I'm so happy to see both La Chimera (my #1 of last year) and Dune: Part Two showing up on so many Best of the Year lists now that we're at the end of 2024. View the full countdown video below.

    "link": "https://www.firstshowing.net/2024/another-teaser-for-american-primeval-brutal-1800s-western-series/",
    "description": "\"America... like never before.\" Netflix has debuted another vivid 45-second teaser trailer for their epic new western series called American Primeval, made by filmmaker Peter Berg and writer / producer Mark L. Smith. It's about the gritty \u0026 adventurous exploration of the birth of the American West. This intense, brutal new western series with 6 episodes launches streaming on Netflix in January 2025 in just another week. American Primeval stars Taylor Kitsch, Betty Gilpin, Dane DeHaan, Saura Lightfoot-Leon, Derek Hinkey, Joe Tippett, Jai Courtney, Preston Mota, Shawnee Pourier, and Shea Whigham. Julie O'Keefe is the Indigenous Cultural Consultant and Project Advisor. Netflix describes it further as: \"This is America…1857. Up is down, pain is everywhere, innocence and tranquility are losing the battle to hatred and fear. Peace is the shrinking minority, and very few possess grace — even fewer know compassion...\" Indeed. Berg's \"American Primeval is a fictionalized dramatization \u0026 examination of the violent collision of culture, religion, and community as men and women fight and die to keep or control this land.\" Sounds thrilling and harrowing - and it sounds like not much has changed in 200 years in America. Check out this footage below. Here's an additional teaser […]",

    "description": "Barbarella Dives into Conversation with FREEDIVER Director Michael John Warren! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here. Michael John Warren’s latest documentary Freediver is available on Prime Video, or buy or rent on Digital starting December 7, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov’s unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving’s impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death.  Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like “How long could I hold my breath?” - the answer is not long at all - or “Would I ever consider free diving?” The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both! Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience.

Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.
