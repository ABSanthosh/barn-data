    "description": "\"We both know I can hack it better than any ding-dong out there!\" ü™ì RLJE Films has revealed an official trailer for an indie horror comedy called Bloody Axe Wound, the latest from genre filmmaker Matthew John Lawrence. The concept is basically: what if Jason Voorhees had a daughter? And what if she wanted to follow in his footsteps but also go her own way? Sounds like fun. Abbie Bladecut is a teenager torn between the macabre traditions of her family's bloody trade and the tender stirrings of her first crush. In the town of Clover Falls, her father, Roger Bladecut, has built an infamous legacy by capturing real-life killings on tape \u0026 selling them. But as Abbie delves deeper into the grisly family business, she begins to wonder if it's time to take the family tradition in a new direction. With Sari Arambulo as Abbie, Molly Brown, Eddie Leavy, with Jeffrey Dean Morgan \u0026 Billy Burke. As the first female slasher, she battles sexism while realizing the harsh realities behind the mass murders. Looks like fun meta horror about slashers that's also a slasher. First official trailer for Matthew John Lawrence's slasher Bloody Axe Wound, direct from YouTube: Abbie [‚Ä¶]",

    "description": "\"Wow you're home is super nice.\" It might be a good idea to never meet your fans. It can be super awkward if you ever meet them ‚Äì maybe even dangerous. Yet another eerie new film about parasocial relationships. Holiday House is a short film created by Alex Heller, who also directed \u0026 starred in the indie film The Year Between a few years ago. Heller describes it as \"mysterious, miniature movie.\" A content creator feels obligated to let her internet benefactor visit her workshop. His arrival explores uncomfortable boundaries of a parasocial friendship. Starring AnnaSophia Robb as Shelley \u0026 David Brown as Marky, with Antonio Marziale \u0026 Adrienne Becker. It is very similar to the other short called Followers about a similar home invasion. I also always reference Ingrid Goes West as the original film about parasocial relationships, where people create extremely unhealthy connections to folks they only know on social media. Freaky! View below. Thanks to Short of the Week for the tip on this one. Brief intro from YouTube: \"In this tense story of online intimacy, Marky derives human connection from the online presence of dollhouse-builder Shelley.

In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with ‚ÄúHey, do you want to write about movies for a website?‚Äù Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I‚Äôll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences. ¬† This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I‚Äôd already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment.
