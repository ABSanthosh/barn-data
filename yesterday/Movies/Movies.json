    "description": "Director Simon West and star Lucy Liu talk OLD GUY, starring Christoph Waltz, now streaming everywhere! Read the full article on AICN Director Simon West should be a household name; his first film was a little picture from 1997 called CON AIR. Perhaps you've heard of it? He went on to helm similar big budget action extravaganzas, such as 2001's LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER and 2012's THE EXPENDABLES 2. Eventually, however, time and changing tastes caught up with West, and now he's directing smaller budget flicks, from action to drama, that move at a slightly slower pace and appeal to a different audience.  The same could be said for Danny Dolinski, the titular OLD GUY of West's latest feature, played by Academy-Award Winner Christoph Waltz (INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, THE GREEN HORNET). Danny's a wetworks expert in a field saturated with hot young assassins, desperately trying to prove he's still relevant, often to his detriment. After recovering from a wrist injury that found him relegated to a cleaner role at a local bakery, Danny is itching to get back in the field. When he's told the only role available is support for young assassing Wihlborg (Cooper Hoffman), he is understandably unenthused. He invites his longtime friend Anata (Lucy Liu) along for their job since it'll take them to some charming locations around Europe, and once underway, tries to take point on every hit. Things don't go as planned. As you can probably already divine, there are so many parallels between Waltz's OLD GUY and West's career. Danny was once the best, the biggest game in town, and his name still opens doors... but the game has Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Julianna Margulies and Gretchen Mol Talk MILLERS IN MARRIAGE, Edward Burns' latest with Eric McClanahan Read the full article on AICN Edward Burns made quite the impression after winning the Best Picture prize at the Sundance Film Festival with his 1995 masterpiece THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN, signifying the emergence of a new and singular voice. The plot synopsis for the film was \"Three Irish Catholic brothers from Long Island struggle to deal with love, marriage, and infidelity.\" Now, thirty years later, Burns has returned with a new vision, MILLERS IN MARRIAGE, with the plot synopsis sounding vaguely familiar - \"Three Irish Catholic siblings from New York struggle to deal with love, marriage, and infidelity.\" What can I say? Dude's got range. However, I'm not here to say that Edward Burns is a one-trick pony or that MILLERS IN MARRIAGE is recycled and tired. Truth is, I really liked this movie. The cast is impeccable and the narrative kept me interested, even when I thought some plot points were a bit contrived or predictable. Burns crafts characters that we want to care about, even if they're narcissistic, self-destructive, manipulative, or just plain wrong. Burns' gift of character and dialogue is that we are drawn into the maw of the devouring devils of his narratives.  This film is no different. Following the Miller siblings, Andy (Burns), Maggie (Julianna Margulies), and Eve (Gretchen Mol), and their orbiting cadre of lovers. Andy is a painter, fresh off a separation from his wife Tina (Morena Baccarin) and now dating one of her former colleagues Renee (Minnie Driver). Maggie is an active novelist married to inert novelist Nick (Campbell Scott), Finish the article on AICN",

All awards will be marked below in the complete list alongside the nominees. There are ten Best Picture noms from 2024, including The Brutalist and Brazil's I'm Still Here and body horror The Substance. At this point, I'm excited for Anora to win everything (one of my favorites of 2024), and Demi Moore to get her time to shine on the stage as well. Will it be Brody or Chalamet or Fiennes winning Best Actor? After months of anticipation and anxiety, we're looking forward to find out what The Academy members have chosen. All of these nominated movies are worthy contenders - including Dune: Part Two and Nickel Boys and Sing Sing and September 5.

    "description": "\"Are you done?\" \"No. I want 'em all.\" Oh damn. 20th Century Studios has debuted a new 60-second promo trailer for The Amateur, the intense revenge movie from British director James Hawes (who also directed a bunch of episodes of spy series \"Slow Horses\" as well). This is opening in April - and the only other trailer so far debuted last year. Glad to finally see something new for this, we've been waiting for more marketing material. The film follows a nerdy CIA cryptographer / software guy who is able to blackmail his own agency into training him to let him go after a group of terrorist who killed his wife in London. He realizes his bosses will not act due to conflicting internal priorities, so he takes things into his own hands. Rami Malek stars as Charles Heller, with Rachel Brosnahan, Caitríona Balfe, Jon Bernthal, Michael Stuhlbarg, Holt McCallany, Julianne Nicholson, Adrian Martinez, Danny Sapani, and Laurence Fishburne. I so want to see this! Malek looks seriously pissed off and I'm all for him getting revenge! Do it! In theaters soon.
