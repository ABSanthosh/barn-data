    "description": "\"You've been given a gift, and it's up to you on how you're going to use it.\" Abramorama has unveiled an official trailer for a film titled The Short Game, a young golfer drama about family. The feature directorial debut of filmmaker Frank Sanza, this is getting released in limited theaters at the end of July this summer. Ben Krieger stars as Jeremy, a talented golfer, who initially dismisses his autistic brother Ethan's golfing abilities. Faced with the choice between a scholarship and his relationship with Ethan, Jeremy chooses his brother... learning life lessons. A teenage golf prodigy struggling with his game has to care for his autistic brother, who unexpectedly helps him rediscover his confidence—and what truly matters in life. Along with Ben Krieger, the cast includes Mackenzie Astin, Katherine Cunningham, Glenn Morshower, Tyler Lofton, Emma Parks, Adyn Alexander, Brandon Potter, and introducing Owen Himfar as Ethan. There was also a doc in 2013 titled The Short Game about young golfers. This seems like the cheesy opposite to Happy Gilmore 2, more about the nice side of golf and what's possible when we put family above all else. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Frank Sanza's film The […]",

    "description": "\"They're willful creatures. You either gonna break them, or they're gonna break you.\" Briarcliff Ent. has revealed the first look teaser trailer for the film titled Sovereign, an American thriller marking the feature directorial debut of filmmaker Christian Swegal. It just premiered at the 2025 Tribeca Film Festival earlier this month, and will be out to watch in July in just a few more weeks. Inspired by true events, Sovereign is a tense and provocative true crime thriller about a father and his teenage son — Jerry and Joseph Kane — who follow the \"Sovereign Citizen\" belief system, a deeply anti-establishment worldview rooted in distrust of government authority. Their journey brings them into conflict with Police Chief Jim Bouchart, setting off a tragic chain of events that forces a reckoning with power, principle, and the limits of freedom. Starring Nick Offerman, Jacob Tremblay, Dennis Quaid, Martha Plimpton, Thomas Mann, and Nancy Travis. Reviews from Tribeca say the film is \"emotionally gripping \u0026 strikingly captured\", a tense look at these kind of American extremists. I definitely do want to see more from this film. Stay tuned for the main trailer soon. Here's the first look teaser trailer (+ poster) for Christian […]",

Many are familiar with the show’s blend of current news commentary and informational journalism from comedians like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Steve Carrell, John Oliver, Samatha Bee, Roy Wood, Jr, Rob Riggle, Jordan Klepper, Wyatt Cenac, Hasan Minhaj, Larry Whitmore, Lewis Black, Desi Lydic, Ronny Chieng, Michael Kosta, and a bevy of others. “The Daily Show’s” audience has grown up alongside the show, with viewership now skewing in higher age demographics than the coveted 18-34 bracket it dominated during its inception. That maturity is reflected in the current iteration of the show, with Stewart hosting on Monday’s while the rest of “The Best F**king News Team” fill in the remainder of the week. “The Daily Show” is a bit of a misnomer as the show broadcasts nightly on Comedy Central (or Paramount+ for those living in the streaming age) from Monday to Thursday. I suppose “The Intermittent Show” just doesn’t have the same ring to it. “The Daily Show” is not unique in its position as a satirical news program, however it remains the definitive iteration of the format. Everyone knows about “The Daily Show,” love it or hate it. A foundational pillar of the show’s ubiquity and popularity is in the writing and execution of the show, which stands head and shoulders above its contemporaries.   I was honored to speak with senior writer Daniel Radosh Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Scott Adkins talks with McEric about his new action film, DIABLO Read the full article on AICN If you’re a fan of current action films then you likely know the name Scott Adkins. He’s either kicked the ass of or had his ass kicked by every action star of the last five decades: Dolph Lundgren, Jackie Chan, Sylvester Stallone, Jean Claude Van Damme, Jet Li, and even Keanu Reeves. That’s right - he was the big guy with the grill in JOHN WICK CHAPTER 4.  Scott’s newest film is DIABLO, which hits theaters and on demand this Friday, June 13th. Conceived alongside action compatriot Marko Zaror, the film takes place in Colombia following Adkins as Kris, a former convict, who seeks to make good on a promise to a fallen friend, which runs him afoul of Zaror’s mercenary, El Corvo. This film isn’t just another straight-to-streaming no-budget piece of content - DIABLO delivers on every front. The fight scenes, choreographed by Zaror, are intense and deftly photographed, thanks to director Ernesto Diaz Espinoza. The gunplay is intense, the acting is top tier, and the film never lags.    Marko Zaror steals his scenes as El Corvo, a mercenary with an iron fist, literally. The six-foot-two Chilean action star has a chilling villain introduction, followed by a massive action scene in a sketchy hideout that plays out like a scene from TERMINATOR. He mows through assailants and bystanders alike with no emotion, only showing a hint of fear when Adkins’s Kris shows up to give him a real fight. El Corvo is fucking terrifying. Their final confrontation is a throwback to Finish the article on AICN",
