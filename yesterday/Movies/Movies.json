    "description": "McEric cleans up his inbox by dumping reviews for NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, RENNER, MOB COPS, and YOUNG WERTHER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all!  I've got some reviews of two films releasing this Friday, April 25th - but thought I'd also take this opportunity to highlight two other films that are already out there but I haven't yet found the time to cover. Hopefully there's something here for everyone, so let's get right to it: First up is NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, starring Jack Quaid (NOVOCAINE, THE COMPANION, \"The Boys\"), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (\"The Boys,\" \"The Walking Dead\"), and Malin Ackerman (WATCHMEN, SLAYERS), directed by Duncan Skiles (THE CLOVEHITCH KILLER) and written by Sean Farley. The film features troubled young man Simon McNally (Quaid), who is trying to find his feet after spending a decade in a facility for mental health treatment, and his paranoid ex-security guard neighbor Ed Deerman. The two form an unlikely partnership when Simon believes he's seen a woman kidnapped but is deemed an unreliable witness by police due to his history and behavior. The two men take it upon themselves to investigate the crime and rescue the woman, revealing a deeper web of villainy in their quiet town. Quaid and Morgan have great chemistry, and Quaid, specifically, does some great work in this film. Whereas the majority of his characters have been able to rely and charm and humor, Simon is stripped of these tools due to the abuse he received at a young age, so the tricks that Quaid would normally utilize to endear himself to audiences are out of reach. Quaid does a great job of humanizing McNally as a Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Actress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"What's this I hear about you wanting to quit the game?\" Empire Ent. has revealed an official trailer for an action comedy movie called Guns Up, the latest from director Edward Drake (of American Siege, Gasoline Alley, and the Detective Knight trilogy). This has no US release set yet - even with Kevin James. It looks like it's opening in European countries this summer before anywhere else, hence why this first trailer and other posters are already out. A family-man ex-cop now moonlighting as a henchman for the mob has one night to get his family out of the city – and keep his dark secret hidden from his kids – after a job goes wrong. Kevin James stars as Ray Hayes, who was working as a mob thug and now needs to get his family to safety. Here's a tidbit from IMDb trivia: \"Kevin James has stated that he got the inspiration for his performance by watching French bulldogs try to jump up on a couch. When they kept falling and were unable to get up, he immediately realized how to portray his sympathetic character in the film.\" Also starring Christina Ricci, Luis Guzmán, Francis Cronin, Kelly Landry, and […]",

    "description": "\"Release her at once!\" Capelight has revealed an official US trailer for a Korean supernatural action thriller movie titled Holy Night: Demon Hunters, hitting theaters to watch starting in May. The film is getting a worldwide release at the same time - in Korea on April 30th, US on May 2nd, and many other countries as well. Seoul descends into chaos as a devil-worshipping criminal network emerges... In a desperate plea for salvation, the police turn to a secret trio of demon hunters armed with supernatural powers – known as the \"Holy Night\". The three of them have supernatural powers which help them find and exorcise demons. Bau, Sharon, and Kim Gun sets out to eradicate the forces of darkness and save Seoul. The cast features Lee David as Kim Gun, Ma Dong-seok (aka Don Lee / known as Korea's Dwayne Johnson) as Bau, and Seo-hyun as Sharon; along with Kyung Soo-jin and Jung Ji-so. There's a lot of new films about supernatural problems coming out of South Korea recently. This might be cool to watch - I just wish it was a better trailer.
