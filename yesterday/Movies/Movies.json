    "description": "Actress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric reviews (new) releases RAGING MIDLIFE and AMERICAN DREAMER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a quick review of two (new) releases hitting the market this St. Patrick's Day Weekend, both of which I actually enjoyed. RAGING MIDLIFE First was RAGING MIDLIFE, a movie that was pitched to me as starring Paula Abdul (I'm a massive fan), Eddie Griffin (DOUBLE TAKE), Walter Koenig (STAR TREK), and Motch O. Mann, the world's foremost Macho Man Randy Savage impersonator. Yeah, I hear it, too. Luckily, I didn't read any further. I saw Paula Abdul's name and shouted \"I'm in!\" Going in to this film blind is the best way to see it. As I'm furnishing you with a review, however, I must speak further to the film. If you want to skip down to AMERICAN DREAMER and go in blind, I do suggest it. Otherwise, here we go. The film, written by Nic Costa and Rob Taylor, and directed by the latter, follows childhood friends Alex and Mark, now in their midlives (see that?) who are chasing their dragon - a purple tanktop once worn by their favorite wrestler, Raging Abe. Raging Abe is a Macho Man Randy Savage-type character who wears a stove pipe hat and chin beard and lives by five \"proclamations,\" all meant to help his young fans navigate life and walk as better people. The film opens with grainy footage of a talk show appearance (think Arsenio Hall) from Raging Abe and his handler, Mary Todd, played by Abdul. The action opens in the eighties with young Alex and Mark ringside Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"This is my heart, it's yours... forever.\" Altered Innocence has unveiled the US trailer for a wild \u0026 sparkly French pop musical film titled Queens of Drama, marking the feature debut of filmmaker Alexis Langlois, known for his splashy music videos. This initiailly premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival last year in the Critics' Week (Semaine de la Critique) sidebar section. Pop diva Mimi Madamour's career peaks in 2005 before spiraling downwards due to her tumultuous love affair with punk icon Billie Kohler, their passionate and rage-fueled relationship playing out on stage for half a century. Featuring an iconic cast, including Asia Argento and Alma Jodorowsky, and containing hit songs like \"Don't Touch\" by Yelle and \"Fisted to the Heart\", this film vividly dissects the turbulence of toxic relationships—whether between fans and their idols or within passionate queer love affairs. Starring Louiza Aura as Mimi Madamour, Gio Ventura, Bilal Hassani (France's Eurovision Song Contest singer in 2019), Alma Jodorowsky, Nana Benamer, Asia Argento, Thomas Poitevin, Dustin Muchuvitz, and Raya Martigny. With music by Rebeka Warrior, Yelle, Mona Soyoc, Pierre Desprats. This looks like a music video turned into a 114 minute movie! Have fun. Here's the official US trailer […]",

    "description": "\"I am waiting for contact...\" Mongrel Media \u0026 Saban Films have unveiled the official trailer for The Last Spark of Hope, a Polish post-apocalyptic survival thriller marking the feature debut of filmmaker Piotr Biedron. The film played at the 2023 Octopus \u0026 Gdynia Polish Film Festivals, and Trieste Science+Fiction Festival in Italy, and is just now getting a VOD release in the US this spring. A woman named Eva (aka Ewa In Polish), who may be the last human on Earth, struggles to survive with only her robot companion in a lonely, post-apocalyptic reality. As she battles the harsh realities of her existence, the stakes intensify when her once-trusted robot turns against her. She doesn't have the password to enter and is trapped. Starring Magdalena Wieczorek and Jacek Beler. The robot in this looks like a funny character - reminds me of Johnny 5 from Short Circuit. Even though I think they're going for a Polish version of that Tom Hanks sci-fi movie Finch. Not sure if this will be any good, but it's worth a look at least – should be entertaining enough. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Piotr Biedron's The Last Spark of Hope, direct from YouTube: […]",
