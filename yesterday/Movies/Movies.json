Moreover, who shepherded us into this bold new world. Director Greg Kohrs and producer Gary Krieg sought this very answer and it brought them to Demis Hassabis.   Demis Hassabis began his journey as a young chess prodigy before shifting gears toward changing the world. He was drawn to the game as a “A fun thinking game,” but after a particularly long battle at a world tournament, he saw a futility in wasting his brain on games when there were real challenges to which he could apply his talents.    During a gap year between high school and college, Demis got an internship at Bullfrog games, where he implemented rudimentary AI into a PC game called Theme Park. His innovation allowed the NPCs to react to each other as well as the gamers’ intervention and create a more interconnected and immersive experience. This caught the eye of Electronic Arts and changed the trajectory of video games for years to come. Despite this transformative influence, Demis focused on college and after graduation sought to tackle the issue of Artificial General Intelligence.   For the uninitiated, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a true thinking creation. Inspired to a point by the AI Deep Blue defeating Chess master Kasparov in 1997, Demis was duly impressed by the victory but saw the limitation of an innovation that could ONLY play chess. As admirable as that was, Demis saw an imminent future where an AI could beat Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry Finish the article on AICN",

Every year for the past few years, I hop on a podcast with my friend Aaron Neuwirth to discuss the festival and the films we watched – comparing notes and opinions. It's always refreshing to take some time to reflect on the festival, on all of the the films (54 for me this year!!), on the very talented new filmmakers, and on the experience of Sundance in January every tear. After 10 intense days of non-stop watching, it's a relief to kick back \u0026 chat about what was the best, and what was the worst, plus everything else good about this indie festival and its always fascinating selection of films each year. My 2025 festival recap podcast with Aaron (recorded as a bonus episode of his podcast show \"Out Now with Aaron \u0026 Abe\") is out now and can be listened to online or via any podcast platform around. I've included a Spotify embed below for anyone who wants to tune in. We tried to cover many of our favorites and also chat about any film that stuck out for just over an hour. Enjoy. […]",

    "description": "\"She's the person I've always wanted to be.\" Mubi has revealed an official trailer for the September Says, an intriguing thriller set in Ireland. This first premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Fstival last year and will arrive in theaters coming up in the next few months. When September is suspended from school, her sister, July, begins to explore her own independence. Tension in the family builds while on holiday in Ireland as a series of surreal encounters test the them all to their limit. A dark and unsettling exploration of sisterhood from writer-director Ariane Labed. Starring Mia Tharia and Pascale Kann as the two sisters, along with Rakhee Thakrar. Adapted from the novel \"Sisters\" written by Daisy Johnson. This earned some positive reviews from festivals last year - in which they state that the film is: \"An elegantly unmoored tale of two sisters that, in its tart and tense examination of codependency and the isolation it breeds, shares a kinship with Athina Rachel Tsangari’s haunting Attenberg and the darkly absurdist satires of Yorgos Lanthimos.\" This does look quite creepy and strange - perhaps a bit too strange for most people to enjoy. Have a look. Here's the official trailer […]",
