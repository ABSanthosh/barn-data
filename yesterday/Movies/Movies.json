Read the full article on AICN Parenthood is sacrifice, and that is the message behind the latest horror film from filmmaker Michael Cummings, aka Spider One of Powerman 5000, aka Rob Zombie's brother. As he puts it in his director's statement: \"In the film, Mindy’s relationship with her monster, Agyar, is clearly my allegory for parenthood. His bites are her pain. His words are her insecurities. His intentions are to prove Mindy’s failure as a parent. We are in solidarity with Mindy, even if, at times we are frustrated and baffled by her actions. And that is exactly the point. She doesn’t know what to do. None of us do. Framing this movie in horror was a natural choice.\" LITTLE BITES tells the story of Mindy Vogel (Krsy Fox, TERRIFIER 3), who is inexplicably saddled with a demon, Agyar (Jon Skarloff, CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER) that demands to feast upon her daughter, Alice. Unwilling to acquiesce, Mindy sends Alice to stay with her mother (Bonnie Arons, THE NUN) while she placates the monster with bites of her own flesh, spinning a plan to rid of her the burden once and for all.  I had the opportunity to speak with writer/director Spider One and lead actress Krsy Fox, neither of whom I felt comfortable addressing by name because I didn't feel entirely sure if Krsy was just pronounced \"Krissy\" and I couldn't rightly look a man in the face and call him \"Spider\".

Moreover, who shepherded us into this bold new world. Director Greg Kohrs and producer Gary Krieg sought this very answer and it brought them to Demis Hassabis.   Demis Hassabis began his journey as a young chess prodigy before shifting gears toward changing the world. He was drawn to the game as a “A fun thinking game,” but after a particularly long battle at a world tournament, he saw a futility in wasting his brain on games when there were real challenges to which he could apply his talents.    During a gap year between high school and college, Demis got an internship at Bullfrog games, where he implemented rudimentary AI into a PC game called Theme Park. His innovation allowed the NPCs to react to each other as well as the gamers’ intervention and create a more interconnected and immersive experience. This caught the eye of Electronic Arts and changed the trajectory of video games for years to come. Despite this transformative influence, Demis focused on college and after graduation sought to tackle the issue of Artificial General Intelligence.   For the uninitiated, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a true thinking creation. Inspired to a point by the AI Deep Blue defeating Chess master Kasparov in 1997, Demis was duly impressed by the victory but saw the limitation of an innovation that could ONLY play chess. As admirable as that was, Demis saw an imminent future where an AI could beat Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"Surprisingly hilarious yet unsurprisingly horny.\" Janus Films has revealed an official US trailer and a new poster for the acclaimed French indie film titled Misericordia, which first premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival last year. This thriller from French director Alain Guiraudie (also of Strange by the Lake) also played at the Telluride, Toronto, New York, London, and Busan Film Festivals last year. In the film, Jérémie returns to his hometown for an old baker friend's funeral, staying even longer after. In this village where so much goes unsaid, he must contend with rumours and suspicion, until he commits an irreparable act and finds himself at the center of a police investigation. Starring Félix Kysyl as Jérémie, with Catherine Frot, Jacques Develay, Jean-Baptiste Durand, and David Ayala. In Alain Guiraudie's quietly carnal world, violence \u0026 eroticism explode with little anticipation, and criminal behavior seems like a natural extension of physical desire. They add: \"the French director is at the top of his game in Misericordia, again upending all genre expectations.\" The film has earned rave reviews from many critics during its festival run, with many quotes seen in this trailer including calling it a \"sickly funny thriller.\" Opens in […]",

Yes he just so happens to be artist / filmmaker Julian Schnabel's son. This premiered at the 2023 Venice Film Festival, and it also played at SXSW \u0026 Santa Barbara last year, and is finally being released in NY \u0026 LA cinemas this March. For anyone intrigued. Impulsive black sheep Alejandro and pet store worker Jack, enter a whirlwind romance that sends them deep down the rabbit hole of depravity in Manhattan's underworld. It's executive produced \u0026 presented by Martin Scorsese, Michel Franco and Jeremy O. Harris, starring Jack Irv \u0026 Dario Yazbek Bernal, alongside Willem Dafoe, Peter Sarsgaard, Emmanuelle Seigner, and more. This is sort of an NYC drama, sort of an old school vibe film, and sort of just a strange crime thriller. Seems like it's trying too hard to be something unique when it just looks derivative \u0026 boring.
