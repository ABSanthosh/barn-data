    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN In a new AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SEGMENT, I will do something terrifically similar to what I did the last time I did this segment, and now that I'm reading that out loud I realize how ridiculous it sounds. Regardless, I once again enter the realm of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and speak with a specialist about what the United States knows, what it doesn't, and the barriers that are preventing it from disclosing its full knowledge to the public. Let's get one thing established right away: the conversation around alien visitation has changed. When I chatted with Disclosure Activist Stephen Bassett back in 2021, we weren't discussing if these visitations were real but rather why we weren't being told about them. Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien. That part is transparent, but THE PROGRAM's findings aren't, and that is the subject of filmmaker James Fox's new documentary, THE PROGRAM. I chatted with James Fox, filmmaker of The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and I Know What I Saw, to discuss THE PROGRAM after viewing it, and though we were able to talk for quite a while, I didn't really have that many questions.

    "description": "\"Fights? And races? Any other bad boy cliches?\" Meet another bad boy and his admirers. Prime Video has unveiled an official trailer for their sultry streaming movie called My Fault: London, ready for viewing in February on PV. This is actually an English language remake / London version of the Spanish series called Culpa Mía (which translates to My Fault) and also Culpa Tuya (which translates to Your Fault) from last year – based on the Culpables novel series by Mercedes Ron. Nick and Noah are about to take a trip that will change their lives forever. An 18-year-old girl moves from America to London with her mother and wealthy stepfather. She meets her stepbrother, and an attraction brews despite their efforts. Unaware, her estranged father tracks her down after release from prison. Starring Matthew Broome and Asha Banks, along with Eve Macklin, Ray Fearon, Enva Lewis, Jason Flemyng, Kerim Hassan, Sam Buchanan, Amelia Kenworthy, and Harry Gilby. I thought the Spanish series was already a big hit worldwide? Why remake it and do nothing different. It looks extra cheesy \u0026 angsty, but that's exactly what they're going for anyway.

This hasn't premiered at any festivals and will be released direct-to-VOD this month. A masked killer slasher horror mashed up with a whodunit mystery? So it seems. When a masked killer slaughters several campers, a sheriff \u0026 deputy track a murderer to a local diner where, using their investigative skills, they must discover which person in the diner is the actual killer. \"An engaging cocktail of slasher, thriller, and whodunnit with a superb cast... genre audiences will find something to love here.\" The film stars Jeremy London and Elena Sanchez as the small-town sheriff and deputy, with Alli Hart, Miles Doleac, Jared Bankens, Ritchie Montgomery, Escalante Lundy, and Madison Wolfe. This doesn't seem that interesting - my guess is the mask takes over people. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Michael Donovan Horn's horror film Bone Face, from YouTube: \"Who wears the mask?\" 👹 When a masked killer slaughters several counselors at a small-town summer camp, Sheriff Vince Cronin and Deputy Jo McCully track the murderer to a local diner […]",
