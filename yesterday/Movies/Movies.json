    "description": "\"Free-ranging wolves in Yellowstone - where are they going to go? What are they going to do?\" 🐺 I can't start this review without admitting that I have loved wolves all of my life. When I was in third grade, I spent time during school lessons trying to convince a wolf sanctuary to bring a wolf down to our elementary school in Colorado so my class could meet one in person and learn more about them (it didn't happen – but I tried anyway). Anyone who knows me will not be surprised to hear me say that I loved this film about wolves and will now proclaim that it is one of the best documentaries of the year. Lost Wolves of Yellowstone is a brand new IMAX Original Documentary film, formerly known as Mollie's Pack. It premiered at the 2025 CPH:DOX Film Festival in Copenhagen, along with premieres at the American Conservation Film Festival \u0026 DC Environmental Film Festival in the US. A deeply moving, emotional, profoundly inspiring, completely riveting film telling two distinct, intertwined stories about wolves \u0026 humans and their intrinsic connection. Lost Wolves of Yellowstone is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Thomas Winston, known for nature docs including […]",

    "link": "https://www.firstshowing.net/2025/first-official-trailer-for-chie-hayakawas-renoir-coming-of-age-film/",
    "description": "This looks like a winner. The first trailer is out already for a Japanese film premiering at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival this May. Renoir is the second feature film from Japanese director Chie Hayakawa, also at Cannes three years ago with her feature directorial debut titled Plan 75 (also a very good film that not many have seen). Renoir is an emotional, poignant coming-of-age story about resilience, the healing power of the imagination and a traumatized family struggling for connection. Featuring Yui Suzuki as Fuki in her first ever film role. Renoir is the story of an 11-year-old girl, Fuki, who lives with her father, who is fighting an illness, and her mother, who is busy with work in the summer in the late 80s. In addition to Hikari Ishida as Fuki's mother, Shiko, and Lily Franky as her father, Keiji – who have won numerous film awards – the adults Fuki encounters include Ayumi Nakajima, Yumi Kawai, who is making her big break following her performance in Plan 75, and Ryuta Bando. From this trailer, it kind of looks like a modern version of the seminal classic Tokyo Story – though set in the late 80s, not in […]",
