    "description": "Actress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric reviews (new) releases RAGING MIDLIFE and AMERICAN DREAMER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a quick review of two (new) releases hitting the market this St. Patrick's Day Weekend, both of which I actually enjoyed. RAGING MIDLIFE First was RAGING MIDLIFE, a movie that was pitched to me as starring Paula Abdul (I'm a massive fan), Eddie Griffin (DOUBLE TAKE), Walter Koenig (STAR TREK), and Motch O. Mann, the world's foremost Macho Man Randy Savage impersonator. Yeah, I hear it, too. Luckily, I didn't read any further. I saw Paula Abdul's name and shouted \"I'm in!\" Going in to this film blind is the best way to see it. As I'm furnishing you with a review, however, I must speak further to the film. If you want to skip down to AMERICAN DREAMER and go in blind, I do suggest it. Otherwise, here we go. The film, written by Nic Costa and Rob Taylor, and directed by the latter, follows childhood friends Alex and Mark, now in their midlives (see that?) who are chasing their dragon - a purple tanktop once worn by their favorite wrestler, Raging Abe. Raging Abe is a Macho Man Randy Savage-type character who wears a stove pipe hat and chin beard and lives by five \"proclamations,\" all meant to help his young fans navigate life and walk as better people. The film opens with grainy footage of a talk show appearance (think Arsenio Hall) from Raging Abe and his handler, Mary Todd, played by Abdul. The action opens in the eighties with young Alex and Mark ringside Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"Am I pretty?\" Kani Releasing has debuted an official US trailer for a Japanese indie film titled Desert of Namibia, the second feature made by young Japanese filmmaker Yoko Yamanaka. This first premiered at last year's Cannes Film Festival in the Directors' Fortnight sidebar section, and it will be playing in US art house theaters starting this May – one year later. The film stars Yumi Kawai as 21-year-old Satsuki – she swaps boyfriends frequently, unconcerned with career or societal norms. Her unpredictable behavior leads to a misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder, as she navigates a rigid, patriarchal society. Described in one review as: \"Elusive, Desert of Namibia is an ultra-melancholic slapstick comedy, a slow-burn vaudeville, a fantasy film without monsters or ghosts–or else entirely populated by monsters and ghosts, but with a seemingly everyday quality...\" And it also \"masterfully conveys the chaos and disarray of a young woman at odds with the world as much as with herself.\" In addition to Kawai, the film stars Keisuke Horibe, Daichi Kaneko, Kanichiro, Yuzumi Shintani, Makiko Watanabe, and Erika Karata. This is definitely worth a look. Here's the official US trailer (+ posters) for Yoko Yamanaka's film Desert of Namibia, from YouTube: Desert of […]",

    "description": "\"Some things in this life you can't get back...\" Falling Forward Films \u0026 Ascending Media Group revealed the first trailer for the western action thriller Rust, directed by Joel Souza. Unfortunately this is the film where the cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was shot and killed while on set from a prop gun loaded with a live round. After the incident, they decided to come together and finish filming anyway, and now it's ready to be released. In Rust, a boy left to fend for himself and his younger brother following their parents' deaths in 1880s Kansas, ends up on the run with his long-estranged grandfather after he is sentenced to hang for the accidental killing of a local rancher. Featuring Alec Baldwin, Frances Fisher, Josh Hopkins, Travis Fimmel, Patrick Scott McDermott, Devon Werkheiser, Rhys Coiro, Xander Berkeley, and Jake Busey. During filming in 2021, Baldwin's gun discharged and struck Hutchins and Souza, killing Hutchins. A few years later filming resumed and the finished film premiered at the Camerimage Film Festival last year (the fest focuses on cinematography so it was a premiere in honor of Hutchins).
