Moreover, who shepherded us into this bold new world. Director Greg Kohrs and producer Gary Krieg sought this very answer and it brought them to Demis Hassabis.   Demis Hassabis began his journey as a young chess prodigy before shifting gears toward changing the world. He was drawn to the game as a “A fun thinking game,” but after a particularly long battle at a world tournament, he saw a futility in wasting his brain on games when there were real challenges to which he could apply his talents.    During a gap year between high school and college, Demis got an internship at Bullfrog games, where he implemented rudimentary AI into a PC game called Theme Park. His innovation allowed the NPCs to react to each other as well as the gamers’ intervention and create a more interconnected and immersive experience. This caught the eye of Electronic Arts and changed the trajectory of video games for years to come. Despite this transformative influence, Demis focused on college and after graduation sought to tackle the issue of Artificial General Intelligence.   For the uninitiated, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a true thinking creation. Inspired to a point by the AI Deep Blue defeating Chess master Kasparov in 1997, Demis was duly impressed by the victory but saw the limitation of an innovation that could ONLY play chess. As admirable as that was, Demis saw an imminent future where an AI could beat Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"You're an expendable! You're here to be expended.\" Perhaps we shouldn't consider any life as expendable. Bong Joon-ho's long-awaited new science fiction movie is finally here and finally ready to be experienced. This big budget, made-by-Hollywood sci-fi spectacle doesn't really belong at film festivals but hey I'll let it slide because it's worth watching anywhere. Mickey 17 is Bong Joon-ho's newest feature film project since winning all the Oscars with Parasite in 2019; it's adapted from the sci-fi novel titled \"Mickey7\" written by Edward Ashton. Bong upped the number of Mickey clones from 7 to 17 just for fun because 7 wasn't enough, to add in more clones to this futuristic story. Bong Joon-ho's other English-language science fiction movie Snowpiercer played at the 2014 Berlin Film Festival (I was there, too - read my original review) and now they've invited him back to the 2025 Berlin Film Festival to screen Mickey 17. There is nothing \"chaotic\" about this movie at all, it's occasionally wacky and funky and weird, but it's still a sharp, streamlined story about clones. This is Bong Joon-ho's Starship Troopers. It rules – and it's even better than Snowpiercer. Mickey 17 is written and directed by Bong […]",

    "description": "\"We're getting married?!\" Uh oh. Magnet Releasing has unveiled an official trailer for a home invasion thriller titled Borderline, marking the feature directorial debut of Cocaine Bear writer Jimmy Warden. Strangely this hasn't played at any film festivals or elsewhere, as far as we know. Magnet is dropping this in theaters in March in a month from now. The premise is a bit like Misery but with an intriguing psychopathic patriarchal twist. Borderline is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that follows a dangerously persistent stalker who invades the home of a '90s pop superstar with grand delusions of a wedding. With her life on the line and help from her loyal bodyguard, she must escape the stalker’s sinister grip before they tie the knot. Paul is desperate to prove his dedication but Sofia's just trying to survive the night... How will she make it out?! Starring Samara Weaving, Ray Nicholson, Jimmie Fails, Alba Baptista, and Eric Dane. This looks totally nuts! Not just a simple home invasion thriller, a lot more strange things going on in here.
