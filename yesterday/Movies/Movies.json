    "description": "McEric highlights a few spooky films for your Halloween night, including DIE ALONE and HOLD YOUR BREATH. Read the full article on AICN ‘Tis the season, for a few more hours, before Mariah Carey breaks through her ice-cocoon and heralds in the winter holidays. If you need a couple of thrillers to hold back the tide of the inevitable, I’ve got you covered with a couple of brand new features released this very month: HOLD YOUR BREATH and DIE ALONE.   DIE ALONE stars Carrie-Anne Moss (THE MATRIX, “The Acolyte”), Frank Grillo (CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, ONE DAY AS A LION), Douglas Smith (HBO’s “Big Love”), and Kimberly-Sue Murray (Netflix’s “V-Wars”). The film is written and directed by Lowell Dean (WOLFCOP, SUPERGRID) and released by Quiver Distribution. After an outbreak turns the majority of the population into plant-based zombies, a young man (Smith) with amnesia searches for his lost love and stumbles across a rugged survivalist (Moss). Check out the trailer:     If you’re getting “The Last of Us” vibes, you’re on the right track. The film features some pretty great creature effects, apt desolation to sell the apocalypse, and a surprisingly original story. Moss is the star of the show, by far, and carries her scenes with a deadpan humor that keeps the heavy subject matter from swallowing the viewer in despair. The budget limitations are clear but the film that emerges is certainly a smart, fun ride that hits all the points of an apocalyptic thriller with a (predictable) plot twist and great performances.   I got the chance to chat with Carrie-Anne Moss about the production of the film, her bicycle-riding skills, and dream roles.

    "description": "Snake Plotzkin Reviews THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF CHRISTOPHER LEE Read the full article on AICN Snake Plotzkin, reporting from Fantastic Fest 2024, where I got to see the biographical documentary, The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee. I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing.  If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015). Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"If what we do doesn't work, then the movie doesn't work.\" This team of artists deserve so much acclaim for this work! One stand out 2024 film that absolutely deserves an Academy Award nomination for its Hair \u0026 Make-Up (tons \u0026 tons of long hair) is the Zellner Brothers' Sasquatch Sunset. It premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival and opened in theaters in April earlier this year (here's the trailer). I'm a big, big fan of this film - I even saw it a second time in theaters because it's so damn good (my full review). The nature film stars Jesse Eisenberg, Riley Keough, Christophe Zajac-Denek, and Nathan Zellner wearing full-on Sasquatch suits playing a kooky family living in a forest trying to survive. This featurette introduces us to Steve Newburn, the lead creature suit designer \u0026 creator. Yes they actually made all these costumes for real and they look incredible! This film is as fantastic as it is because the actors' performances are able to shine through despite being in these very believable, heavy fur-covered outfits.

    "description": "\"You'll have two choices.\" What are they?! Well Go USA has revealed an official US trailer for Blasting, a Chinese action thriller that is finally available to watch on VOD in the US. This first opened in 2022 in China during the pandemic under the original title Life and Death Blast. A series of explosions mirror a past case from 8 years ago, prompting a joint investigation between SWAT and the Criminal Investigation Bureau. The film is adapted from the real life experiences of the original characters. It tells the story of how Qiu Jie, captain of the criminal police team of the \"serious crime squad\", and Xu Zhongmin, the leader of the bomb disposal team, used their flesh \u0026 blood to build a \"Great Wall of Steel\" to save the entire city in the face of an explosion crisis. Starring Ken Lok, Crazybarby Leni Lan, Bai Haito, and Zhong Lei. Written and directed by Wang Xiao Long. This looks exceptionally cheesy, especially the big red countdown bombs in it.
