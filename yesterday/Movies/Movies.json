    "description": "Actress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric reviews (new) releases RAGING MIDLIFE and AMERICAN DREAMER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a quick review of two (new) releases hitting the market this St. Patrick's Day Weekend, both of which I actually enjoyed. RAGING MIDLIFE First was RAGING MIDLIFE, a movie that was pitched to me as starring Paula Abdul (I'm a massive fan), Eddie Griffin (DOUBLE TAKE), Walter Koenig (STAR TREK), and Motch O. Mann, the world's foremost Macho Man Randy Savage impersonator. Yeah, I hear it, too. Luckily, I didn't read any further. I saw Paula Abdul's name and shouted \"I'm in!\" Going in to this film blind is the best way to see it. As I'm furnishing you with a review, however, I must speak further to the film. If you want to skip down to AMERICAN DREAMER and go in blind, I do suggest it. Otherwise, here we go. The film, written by Nic Costa and Rob Taylor, and directed by the latter, follows childhood friends Alex and Mark, now in their midlives (see that?) who are chasing their dragon - a purple tanktop once worn by their favorite wrestler, Raging Abe. Raging Abe is a Macho Man Randy Savage-type character who wears a stove pipe hat and chin beard and lives by five \"proclamations,\" all meant to help his young fans navigate life and walk as better people. The film opens with grainy footage of a talk show appearance (think Arsenio Hall) from Raging Abe and his handler, Mary Todd, played by Abdul. The action opens in the eighties with young Alex and Mark ringside Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"We're gonna handle this locally...\" This looks intensely dark and unsettling. Well Go USA has unveiled an official trailer for Barron's Cove, a very dark crime thriller marking the feature debut of filmmaker Evan Ari Kelman. This originally premiered at the 2024 Hamptons Film Festival last year, and it will also be out to watch in June this summer, including on VOD right away. When Caleb Whitaker's son is killed in a tragic accident, grief consumes him entirely... But when the system fails to hold the responsible child accountable, Caleb takes matters into his own hands—abducting the boy and vanishing into the wilderness. His desperate act ignites a frantic manhunt, led by a power-hungry politician eager to twist the tragedy for personal gain. As tensions rise, Caleb must decide whether vengeance will truly bring him peace or justice. Starring Garett Hedlund, Hamish Linklater, Brittany Snow, Christian Convery, Tramell Tillman, Raúl Castillo and Stephen Lang. Impressive cast, tons of big names. But hard to tell if it'll be an engaging watch or not.

This 4-mintue long short film features footage of a bunch of people up in Sweden having fun snow drifting in the middle of winter, all set to an entrancing Swedish song from artist Sara Parkman. It may seem like this is just another YouTube of kids goofing off and doing dangerous things (and it kind of is), but watching this you may find yourself impressed by the filmmaking and the entire stunt. Along with the whole concept, it's beautiful the way the snow and craziness and music all come together to offer an entertaining journey into this fun night on the snowy roads of Småland, Sweden. It's like Tokyo Drift, but Sweden Drift, a snowy version of street drifting. I'm glad they stuck that light rack on top of the car, because the way the lights bounce off the trees and snow is glorious. You might find yourself watching this video over and over...
