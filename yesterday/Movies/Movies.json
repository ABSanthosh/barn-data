    "description": "McEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "A brand new British folk horror creation has revealed itself at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival. Rabbit Trap is the feature directorial debut of up-and-coming British-Australian filmmaker Bryn Chainey, who both wrote and directed this film. Yet another extremely personal project based on his own worst fears and experiences, like many filmmakers trying to work through them by making a film about them. Rabbit Trap is set in 1976 and follows a young married couple who live out in the wilderness in rural England in a little cabin. While living out there alone, trying to make unique music and record natural sounds, they end up encountering some strange supernatural forces. This sends them into a tizzy as they attempt to make sense of what is going on – and it gets especially weird when a mysterious kid randomly shows up and works his/her way into their life. There are some intriguing ideas in this but it never amounts to much in the end, and the finale is rather lackluster. But I am enchanted by most of it anyway and I cannot write off the entire film. Bryn Chainey's Rabbit Trap features two main characters: an avant-garde musician named Daphne, played […]",

    "description": "\"Mr. Prime Minister, something has to be done... we're going covert.\" Well Go USA has revealed an official trailer for an action movie called Invasion, also known as Invasie in Dutch. This is made by a filmmaker named Bobby Boermans from the Netherlands. It's a very jingostic film about the Dutch military trying to deal with an attack on one of its territories. Way too many films like this these days – almost if they're trying to condition people into thinking this is the only way to respond. When neighboring rogue country Veragua suddenly attacks Curaçao \u0026 Aruba, the Dutch government is taken totally by surprise. The conflict escalates rapidly. Three young Dutch Corps recruits must figure out what is the right thing to do. Will they be able to save the day? The action cast includes Tarikh Janssen, Gijs Blom, Ortál Vriend, Jasha Rudge, Fedja Van Huêt, Gijs Scholten Van Aschat, and Raymond Thiry. This looks like a movie made for military junkies to get off on, all about how a skilled covert ops team can use their big weapons to defend their land. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Bobby Boermans' action movie Invasion, direct from YouTube: When […]",
