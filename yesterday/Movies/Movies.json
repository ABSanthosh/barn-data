    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN In a new AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SEGMENT, I will do something terrifically similar to what I did the last time I did this segment, and now that I'm reading that out loud I realize how ridiculous it sounds. Regardless, I once again enter the realm of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and speak with a specialist about what the United States knows, what it doesn't, and the barriers that are preventing it from disclosing its full knowledge to the public. Let's get one thing established right away: the conversation around alien visitation has changed. When I chatted with Disclosure Activist Stephen Bassett back in 2021, we weren't discussing if these visitations were real but rather why we weren't being told about them. Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien. That part is transparent, but THE PROGRAM's findings aren't, and that is the subject of filmmaker James Fox's new documentary, THE PROGRAM. I chatted with James Fox, filmmaker of The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and I Know What I Saw, to discuss THE PROGRAM after viewing it, and though we were able to talk for quite a while, I didn't really have that many questions.

    "description": "\"I really hope that people will walk away from this film unable to forget the imagery.\" 😱 Universal has revealed yet another 2-minute behind-the-scenes promo featurette for Leigh Whannell's Wolf Man movie, landing in theaters in just a few more weeks. Ready for a good scare? Produced by Blumhouse, this a fresh update on the classic furry Universal Monster originally invented in the 1941 film The Wolf Man. \"What if someone you loved became something else?\" What would you do? A man must save himself and his family when they are stalked, terrorized, and haunted by a deadly werewolf at night – but something else is going on with him, too. Christopher Abbott co-stars with Julia Garner and Matilda Firth. This promo video features Leigh and his creature designer named Arjen Tuiten (the prosthetics \u0026 special make-up effects designer) discussing making the movie. The focus is on designing the monster and figuring out how to make the prosthetics look real and very unsettling. The anecdote about how the entire crew was scared by the full-on prosthetics is awesome - I dig this kind of hype. Wolf Man hits theaters soon - catch it on the big screen.

    "description": "\"As you guys get older, you're gonna have to work harder to find time for each other – but it is well worth the effort.\" Greenwich has debuted an official trailer for an indie awkward dramredy called Ex-Husbands, arriving for release starting in February 2025. This initially premiered back at the 2023 San Sebastian Film Festival and toured to many other fests including last year's Palm Springs \u0026 Sarasota Film Festivals. Griffin Dunne and Rosanna Arquette were last seen together in the film After Hours, the 1985 dark comedy from Martin Scorsese, though they're time together in this new one is brief. When Peter Pearce flies to Tulum, crashing his son Nick's bachelor party, Peter realizes he's not the only Pearce man in crisis. The indie film stars Griffin Dunne and Rosanna Arquette, along with Richard Benjamin, Miles Heizer, \u0026 James Norton. Most of this takes place in Mexico where Dunne messes with his son's party and his friends. Enjoy. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Noah Pritzker's film Ex-Husbands, direct from YouTube: Manhattan dentist Peter Pearce (Griffin Dunne) is suddenly facing his own midlife crisis after his wife of 35 years (Rosanna Arquette) leaves him...
