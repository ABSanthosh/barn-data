    "description": "\"You can't fake being in -40°. You take your gloves off for a few seconds, your fingers start to freeze...\" ❄ Paramount has revealed a quick featurette video from Tom Cruise's Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning focusing on their film shoot up in Norway. The video is titled \"Shooting in Svalbard\" and features Tom Cruise \u0026 Chris McQuarrie briefly talking about what it was like to shoot in the snow \u0026 ice. This is the 8th entry in the long running Mission Impossible franchise - and the conclusion to Dead Reckoning Part One from 2023. Plot details are still a secret - obviously Hunt needs to stop some dangerous weapon from destroying the world. The huge cast of Final Reckoning features Tom Cruise with Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Vanessa Kirby, Esai Morales, Pom Klementieff, Henry Czerny, Holt McCallany, Janet McTeer, Nick Offerman, \u0026 many more. Svalbard is a Norwegian archipelago between mainland Norway and the North Pole (see Google Maps) one of the most northern places on Earth inhabited by humans. James Gunn's Superman also filmed scenes in Svalbard. As cool as it is that they shot there, no idea what Ethan's team is doing there or […]",

    "description": "\"What do you mean there are living creatures here?\" What in the?! A second trailer has been unveiled for an indie stop-motion animation movie called Junk World, the next film in a trilogy set around the Junk Head universe. Junk World is the new film from filmmaker Takahide Hori, following his first film Junk Head in 2017, about a world where weird cloned humanoid-esque creations live underground. Four years have passed since Junk Head sent the world into a frenzy. Junk World, which depicts the world 1042 years before, invites you once again into an unknown adventure. This funky fun film will hit Japanese theaters in June, though we have no idea when it'll show up anywhere else yet. The film features stop-motion animated puppets and strange creatures galore. Similar to the craziness seen in Phil Tippett's Mad God (2021). This new trailer (here's the other one) focuses more on the story, following a group of government schmucks who come down to the Junk World and discover there's more going on there than they thought. All of these weird creatures are so cool and so much fun that I can't help but be interested in this. Keep an eye out […]",

    "description": "Actress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric reviews (new) releases RAGING MIDLIFE and AMERICAN DREAMER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a quick review of two (new) releases hitting the market this St. Patrick's Day Weekend, both of which I actually enjoyed. RAGING MIDLIFE First was RAGING MIDLIFE, a movie that was pitched to me as starring Paula Abdul (I'm a massive fan), Eddie Griffin (DOUBLE TAKE), Walter Koenig (STAR TREK), and Motch O. Mann, the world's foremost Macho Man Randy Savage impersonator. Yeah, I hear it, too. Luckily, I didn't read any further. I saw Paula Abdul's name and shouted \"I'm in!\" Going in to this film blind is the best way to see it. As I'm furnishing you with a review, however, I must speak further to the film. If you want to skip down to AMERICAN DREAMER and go in blind, I do suggest it. Otherwise, here we go. The film, written by Nic Costa and Rob Taylor, and directed by the latter, follows childhood friends Alex and Mark, now in their midlives (see that?) who are chasing their dragon - a purple tanktop once worn by their favorite wrestler, Raging Abe. Raging Abe is a Macho Man Randy Savage-type character who wears a stove pipe hat and chin beard and lives by five \"proclamations,\" all meant to help his young fans navigate life and walk as better people. The film opens with grainy footage of a talk show appearance (think Arsenio Hall) from Raging Abe and his handler, Mary Todd, played by Abdul. The action opens in the eighties with young Alex and Mark ringside Finish the article on AICN",
