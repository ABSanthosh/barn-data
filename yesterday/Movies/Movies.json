    "description": "Hercules loves Superman 2025 Read the full article on AICN Superman 2025 FAQ I am – Hercules!! What’s it called? “Superman.” Who’s responsible? James Gunn, writer and director of the wonderful “The Suicide Squad” (the one with Idris Elba and John Cena, not the one with Will Smith) and all three excellent “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies. Is it any good? Like much of Gunn’s prior work, it’s funny and moving and exciting, and never boring. There’s plenty to nitpick, but you’d be a fool to miss this very entertaining entertainment. What says Warner Bros.? “Superman embarks on a journey to reconcile his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing as Clark Kent.” How does it start? As John Williams’ Superman theme plays, a lot of text catches us up on what happened. 300 years ago (superhumans became public knowledge on Earth), 30 years ago (an alien spacecraft crashed into Kansas), 3 years ago (a new superhuman arrived in Metropolis), 3 weeks ago (a superhuman interfered in a middle-eastern conflict), 3 hours ago (another new superhuman, one billing himself as The Hammer of Borovia, arrived in Metropolis), and 3 minutes ago (Superman loses a brawl for the first time ever).* (*It is NOT mentionedd in this world-building exposition dump that Lois and Clark became romantically involved 3 months ago.)

    "description": "Barbarella Finds MATERIALISTS Pointless Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here to tell you how completely disappointing Materialists is. How can a movie where Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vie for the affections of a matchmaker fail so badly? Well, let me tell you.  For starters, the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and either romantic rival doesn't quite feel like it's intense enough, so perhaps the casting has some impact, but I don't think that's the issue. I think the script deserves the blame. Don't get me wrong. The story includes lots of laughable moments around dating expectations and so forth. However, one expects characters to evolve throughout a story, to learn lessons, gain deeper understanding or just grow into better people through interactions with others or situations in which they find themselves. None of this happens. So much of the story just makes no sense.   For instance, we are led to believe that Lucy, who’s been a top matchmaker for quite some time, never knew that people in real life are sometimes different than they appear on paper. She only learns this when an incident occurs with one of the couples she matches. I mean, anyone who’s ever been on a dating site or watched a True Crime story should know that people can portray themselves as something that they’re not. Technically, she apparently does already know people lie on the questionnaire because she comments about guys lying about their height.  For her to apparently have this “revelation” that makes her reevaluate her priorities simply doesn’t track. While that bothers me Finish the article on AICN",

Sunrise Films \u0026 Vertigo Releasing have unveiled an official trailer for The Drowned, an indie UK horror film marking the feature directorial debut of filmmaker Samuel Clemens. The film, formerly known as The Waterhouse, first premiered in London at FrightFest Halloween in 2023 and will be out on VOD starting in October this fall (in the US \u0026 UK). After pulling off a major art heist, three men arrive at a secluded coastal safe house to discover their fourth accomplice is missing. Was one of them responsible... or is there a malevolent ancient myth lurking at the water's edge? Woven with references to Greek mythology, they must now figure out if the blame lies with a more sinister presence lurking in the deep water... Starring Alan Calton, Dominic Vulliamy, Lara Lemon, Lily Catalifo, and Corrinne Wicks. This looks chilling and more strange than terrifying. Are these three women sirens? Is this house even real? Have to watch to find out all the answers. Here's the official UK trailer (+ poster) for Samuel Clemens' horror film The Drowned, from YouTube: Woven with references to […]",

The film is inspired by the complex and revolutionary music and lyrics of Marc Bolan and T. Rex, the glam rock powerhouse behind \"Bang a Gong (Get it On)\" and other iconic songs. Featuring archival performances and interviews with Elton John, Ringo Starr, and David Bowie, plus filmed musical interpretations by artists such as Nick Cave, John Cameron Mitchell, Joan Jett, Macy Gray, U2, and Father John Misty. These combine with archival footage to trace Bolan's life from his teenage years digging through Carnaby Street dustbins with David Bowie to his tragic death at the age of 29.
