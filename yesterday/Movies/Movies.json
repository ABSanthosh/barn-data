The seasoned Hollywood publicist spent a decade raising her kids in the Pacific Palisades, where blazes would often threaten her home from the hills to the north. Historically, however, “fire had never jumped Sunset Boulevard and threatened our town,” she said. But that changed on […]",

    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN In a new AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SEGMENT, I will do something terrifically similar to what I did the last time I did this segment, and now that I'm reading that out loud I realize how ridiculous it sounds. Regardless, I once again enter the realm of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and speak with a specialist about what the United States knows, what it doesn't, and the barriers that are preventing it from disclosing its full knowledge to the public. Let's get one thing established right away: the conversation around alien visitation has changed. When I chatted with Disclosure Activist Stephen Bassett back in 2021, we weren't discussing if these visitations were real but rather why we weren't being told about them. Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien. That part is transparent, but THE PROGRAM's findings aren't, and that is the subject of filmmaker James Fox's new documentary, THE PROGRAM. I chatted with James Fox, filmmaker of The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and I Know What I Saw, to discuss THE PROGRAM after viewing it, and though we were able to talk for quite a while, I didn't really have that many questions.

    "description": "\"Where am I now? Where am I now?\" Quiver has unveiled an official trailer for Creep Box, an indie horror sci-fi thriller from filmmaker Patrick Biesemans. This first premiered at the 2023 Trieste Science+Fiction Festival in Italy, and it also played at the 2024 Boston Sci-Fi Film Festival last year. After his wife's death, a scientist tries to use ground-breaking technology to determine if there is life after death, but once he is through the looking glass, there is no turning back. He investigates both a murder case and a suicide looking for answers. As his mind begins to slip, he slowly starts to descend into obsession... The film stars Geoffrey Cantor, Sean Mahon, Ian Lithgow, Katie Kuang, and Adam David Thompson. This funky little sci-fi film is about the \"sense of isolation\" that technology creates nowadays, as well as processing grief and the many ways someone can navigate it. It looks a bit like a fresh spin on Primer with a few dark twists \u0026 turns. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Patrick Biesemans' sci-fi film Creep Box, direct from YouTube: A technician for a shadowy tech firm whose devices allow for communication with the dead investigates a […]",

This first premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival last year and it will be getting an online premiere exactly one year from its original debut. If you want to watch it online during this time on January 24th, click here ($24 for 24 hours). The doc film is showing as a \"24 Hours of Eno\" event, because it features generative elements and always-changing footage, making it \"unique\" every single time anyone watches it - including during this 24 hour period. In the first career-spanning doc about the legendary artist, filmmaker Gary Hustwit set out to decode Eno's creative strategies and to reject the hagiographic impulses of the music doc genre. The result is a \"generative documentary about artist Brian Eno, with 52 quintillion possible iterations, so that no viewing is the same twice.\" Sound cool? Have a look.
