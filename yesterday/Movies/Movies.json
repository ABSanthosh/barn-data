    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN In a new AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SEGMENT, I will do something terrifically similar to what I did the last time I did this segment, and now that I'm reading that out loud I realize how ridiculous it sounds. Regardless, I once again enter the realm of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and speak with a specialist about what the United States knows, what it doesn't, and the barriers that are preventing it from disclosing its full knowledge to the public. Let's get one thing established right away: the conversation around alien visitation has changed. When I chatted with Disclosure Activist Stephen Bassett back in 2021, we weren't discussing if these visitations were real but rather why we weren't being told about them. Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien. That part is transparent, but THE PROGRAM's findings aren't, and that is the subject of filmmaker James Fox's new documentary, THE PROGRAM. I chatted with James Fox, filmmaker of The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and I Know What I Saw, to discuss THE PROGRAM after viewing it, and though we were able to talk for quite a while, I didn't really have that many questions.

Yet another new video countdown has debuted - this one is created by a young film critic named Will Bjarnar. This video featuring his 25 Best Films of 2024 is inspired by David Ehrlich's usual Top 25 Countdown (which will be out next week) and follows the same kind of editing. Bjarnar counts down his favorites from 2024, featuring tons of our own favorites as well. I'm so glad to see Furiosa, Hit Man, Bird, The Room Next Door, Close Your Eyes, and Challengers showing up on best of the year lists. These are some of the best of last year along with all the usual: Nickel Boys, Anora, The Brutalist, No Other Land, and Dune: Part Two. We've also featured a few other great 2024 video countdowns: Clementine's 2024 in Film, Patrick \u0026 Kyle's 25 Best Films of 2024, Little White Lies' 30 Best Films of 2024 Video Recap.

    "description": "\"Are you content?\" Well, are you? Vertical has released another new official US trailer for an indie sci-fi romantic thriller called Turn Me On set in an emotionless dystopian future. It premiered at the 2024 San Sebastian Film Festival and already opened in the UK last fall (view that one here). In a lifeless world, one couple will find their spark again in this dystopian romcom. In a world where the inconvenience of human emotion has been eradicated by a government-imposed daily vitamin, one young couple skips their dose and discovers love, joy, sex and all the baggage that comes with it. A young couple (named Joy and William) discover many new feelings, but realize they come with more challenges as well. Starring Bel Powley, Nick Robinson, Justin H. Min, Griffin Newman, Nesta Cooper, Patti Harrison, and D'Arcy Carden. This is the same concept as the sci-fi romance film Equals (2015) with Kristen Stewart from a few years ago. It doesn't seem like it has anything new to offer or much to say about emotions that we don't already know. Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Michael Tyburski's film Turn Me On, direct from YouTube: You can rewatch […]",
