    "description": "SORRY BABY Thoughtfully Explores Trauma's Aftermath Read the full article on AICN Hey friends. Barbarella here after being enthralled with Sorry, Baby, a thoughtfully told story about the enduring effects of trauma. In theaters now, Eva Victor’s film proves both sensitive and candid. Although violence lies at the center of everything, it avoids showing any potentially triggering sequences. During the pivotal event that takes place within a house, the camera remains outside holding a static shot on the domicile’s façade. The viewer could only imagine what occurs behind the door. The stillness of the scene provides a stark contrast to the savagery we envision happening within. This masterful decision makes the scene more powerful as we must sit with the knowledge and gravity of what we suspect occurs inside. This quiet restraint characterizes much of the film, distinguishing it from other cinematic explorations of trauma. Much of the film proves artfully still as Agnes (Eva Victor) grapples with her life in the aftermath of the aforementioned event. While the topic is serious, it’s not an unrelenting, heavy film. Rather, it’s injected with humor and care throughout. The tale reveals the deep impact a moment in time could have on a life’s trajectory, and it shows the resilience of survivors as they struggle to find meaning, humor, and connection in the aftermath.   Sorry, Baby relies heavily on its brilliant cast who draw out the intricacies of each moment. Naomi Ackie and Eva Victor do most of the heavy lifting, carrying the emotional heart of the film, and I can’t get enough of either. Naomi imbues Lydie Finish the article on AICN",

James Gunn, writer and director of the wonderful “The Suicide Squad” (the one with Idris Elba and John Cena, not the one with Will Smith) and all three excellent “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies. Is it any good? Like much of Gunn’s prior work, it’s funny and moving and exciting, and never boring. There’s plenty to nitpick, but you’d be a fool to miss this very entertaining entertainment. What says Warner Bros.? “Superman embarks on a journey to reconcile his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing as Clark Kent.” How does it start? As John Williams’ Superman theme plays, a lot of text catches us up on what happened: 300 years ago superhumans became public knowledge on Earth, 30 years ago an alien spacecraft crashed into Kansas, 3 years ago a new superhuman arrived in Metropolis, 3 weeks ago a superhuman interfered in a middle-eastern conflict, 3 hours ago another new superhuman, one billing himself as The Hammer of Borovia, arrived in Metropolis, and 3 minutes ago Superman loses a brawl for the first time ever.* Then we see what a lot of fans have already seen in that famous clip: a bloodied and beaten Superman crash-lands in a field of snow, then summons Krypto to take him home.

    "description": "\"I just needed a safe space to work through my feelings.\" Quiver has unveiled the full trailer for an action comedy titled Hostile Takeover, another of these dime-a-dozen junk action flicks. It's heading to VOD in August in a few weeks if anyone wants to give it a go. The movie is about Pete, a professional hitman, who faces a group of assassins when a crime syndicate boss suspects disloyalty because he goes to \"Workaholics Anonymous\" meetings. Michael Jai White stars at hitman Pete Strykyr, along with Aimee Stolte, Aleks Paunovic, and Dawn Olivieri. Hostile Takeover is described as a \"hyper-stylized, kinetic thrill ride full of savage action, mystery and humor. Think John Wick meets Crank, with a dash of Burn After Reading – a brutal, wildly entertaining examination of burnout, betrayal \u0026 what happens when the city's most efficient killer decides to find a littler inner peace... and ends up starting a war.\" Looks so bad despite the fun setup. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Michael Hamilton-Wright's film Hostile Takeover, from YouTube: Pete Strykyr (Michael Jai White) is a top-tier hitman with a knack for talking his way out of trouble—until a deadly mix-up puts a target […]",

No release date is set yet - expected sometime later in the year. Inspired by the real-life story of Prince Naseem \"Naz\" Hamed, a British-Yemeni boxer, and his journey from humble beginnings to becoming a champion and his training under Brendan Ingle – who played a crucial role in his success. About their rise to the top of professional boxing. Giant is an inspiring biopic of one of the greatest showmen the sporting world has even seen – the untold true story of the boy behind \"The Prince\". Naseem Hamed is played by Amir El-Masry with Pierce Brosnan as Brendan Ingle. From executive producer Sylvester Stallone (of course).
