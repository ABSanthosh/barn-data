    "description": "McEric takes a look at some of the films screening at this year's Tribeca Film Festival in NYC from June 4th - 15th. Read the full article on AICN The Tribeca Film Festival is set to descend once again upon New York City this June 4th through 15th. Begun in 2002 by Robert DeNiro, Jane Rosenthal, and Craig Hatkoff, the festival sought to revitalize Lower Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks and has since become one of the premiere film festivals of North America. This year, alone, the programmers narrowed down their selections from over 13,000 submissions. This year's line-up boasts 95 world premieres from filmmakers across 36 countries, collecting everything from feature films to shorts, episodic content, audio storytelling, interactive games, and more.  I'll be on site for several days of the festival to screen films and speak with attending talent, so let's take a look at some of the selections that made my shortlist of interest: First off, the big trend this year is music documentaries - the festival has programmed at least fifteen music-based films, beginning with the opening night gala selection BILLY JOEL: AND SO IT GOES. The festivities will likely be more of a eulogy than a celebration due to recent developments, but it's still nice to kick off a definitively New York festival with one of the City's own beloved sons as the subject of its inaugural film. Other documentaries that feature prominently are METALLICA SAVED MY LIFE, BILLY IDOL SHOULD BE DEAD, BOY GEORGE 7 CULTURE CLUB, DEPECHE MODE: M, I WAS BORN THIS WAY: CARL BEAN, MOVE YA BODY: THE BIRTH OF HOUSE, and THE SIXTH BOROUGH. This final film made my shortlist as Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a review of the Furst Brothers' new horror/comedy A BREED APART, out now in theaters and on-demand. The film follows several Internet celebrities who are invited to an island overrun by rabid dogs to compete for a prize... survival. Check out the trailer: The film stars Grace Caroline Currey (SHAZAM: FURY OF THE GODS, FALL), Virginia Gardner (FALL, 2018's HALLOWEEN), Page Kennedy (THE MEG, THE MEG 2), Troy Gentile (ABC's \"The Goldbergs\"), Riele Downs (Nickelodeon's \"Henry Danger\"), Zak Steiner (Netflix's \"Jessica Jones\"),and Hayden Panittiere (NBC's \"Heroes\"). The film is directed by Griff Furst and brother Nathan Furst, whose previous collaboration as co-directors brought us NIGHTMARE SHARK. Solo, Griff Furst has directed such films as SWAMP SHARK, GHOST SHARK, and TRAILER PARK SHARK, so he clearly knows his way around a creature feature... even if he doesn't really want to. \"Who is Louie Myman?\" I asked when we spoke this past Friday. [Louie Myman is the credited director of Furst's films 100 MILLION BC and ALLIGATOR ALLEY.) \"Oh, Louie Myman! Do you know Alan Smithee?\" \"Yes.\" \"He's Alan Smithee's brother. Yeah, I mean, it's a tough thing. It's an interesting thing to explore. It's like when you do a creature feature and it rates well, and it does well, they just offer you more of them. And I love them, don't get me wrong. I grew up watching all these creature features - Mysterious Island and Jaws and Cujo. I love those movies, but I love ALL kinds of movies. The creature feature, itself, Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"Be the difference and be loud.\" Kino Lorber has revealed the official trailer for an acclaimed documentary film titled Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore, opening in theaters in June coming up soon. This first premiered at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival earlier this year earning great reviews, before showing up at tons of other festivals including: SXSW, Hot Docs, RiverRun, Thessaloniki, Sarasota, Mammoth Lake, and many others. This is the story of Deaf actress Marlee Matlin, who won the Oscar at age 21, and made her big comeback with CODA recently. Director Shoshannah Stern reimagines traditional doc film storytelling, elevating ASL as the film's heart \u0026 soul while removing the typical voiceovers and including open captions, creating an authentic \u0026 visually immersive experience for all to enjoy. Through split-screen interviews with both Deaf and hearing contributors, the film weaves a poignant \u0026 inspiring narrative of Matlin's legendary career, highlighting her tireless fight for inclusion and representation in an entertainment world that at first had no place for her. She's awesome. Yep – this looks like it's an engaging and uplifting biopic doc to watch. Here's the official trailer for Shoshannah Stern's doc Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore, on YouTube: In […]",

Created by filmmaking duo Nicole Daddona \u0026 Adam Wilder, who run a studio called \"Magic Society Pictures\" in New York City together, this short film originally premiered at the 2024 Sundance \u0026 SXSW Film Festivals last year in the Midnight Shorts section. It's now available to watch for free thanks to our friends at Short of the Week. \"Where do your missing socks go?\" This very weird, very dark 8-minute animated short is about a woman known as \"The Bleacher\" who is looking for her missing sock at a laundromat. She gets sucked into the laundry machine then ends up in her own subconscious - where she encounter a very creepy singing dolphin. But, uh, why? Starring the voices of Kate Micucci, Ben Sinclair, \u0026 Sky Elobar. It's best to not try to describe anything else about this, you just have to experience it yourself. And make sense of it on your own. Bravo to Nicole \u0026 Adam for creating something I've never seen before with some of the strangest visuals […]",
