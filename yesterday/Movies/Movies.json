    "description": "Hercules loves Superman 2025 Read the full article on AICN Superman 2025 FAQ I am – Hercules!! What’s it called? “Superman.” Who’s responsible? James Gunn, writer and director of the wonderful “The Suicide Squad” (the one with Idris Elba and John Cena, not the one with Will Smith) and all three excellent “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies. Is it any good? Like much of Gunn’s prior work, it’s funny and moving and exciting, and never boring. There’s plenty to nitpick, but you’d be a fool to miss this very entertaining entertainment. What says Warner Bros.? “Superman embarks on a journey to reconcile his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing as Clark Kent.” How does it start? As John Williams’ Superman theme plays, a lot of text catches us up on what happened. 300 years ago (superhumans became public knowledge on Earth), 30 years ago (an alien spacecraft crashed into Kansas), 3 years ago (a new superhuman arrived in Metropolis), 3 weeks ago (a superhuman interfered in a middle-eastern conflict), 3 hours ago (another new superhuman, one billing himself as The Hammer of Borovia, arrived in Metropolis), and 3 minutes ago (Superman loses a brawl for the first time ever).* (*It is NOT mentionedd in this world-building exposition dump that Lois and Clark became romantically involved 3 months ago.) Then we see what a lot of fans have already seen in that famous clip: a bloodied and beaten Superman crash-lands in a field of snow, then summons Krypto Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Barbarella Finds MATERIALISTS Pointless Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here to tell you how completely disappointing Materialists is. How can a movie where Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vie for the affections of a matchmaker fail so badly? Well, let me tell you.  For starters, the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and either romantic rival doesn't quite feel like it's intense enough, so perhaps the casting has some impact, but I don't think that's the issue. I think the script deserves the blame. Don't get me wrong. The story includes lots of laughable moments around dating expectations and so forth. However, one expects characters to evolve throughout a story, to learn lessons, gain deeper understanding or just grow into better people through interactions with others or situations in which they find themselves. None of this happens. So much of the story just makes no sense.   For instance, we are led to believe that Lucy, who’s been a top matchmaker for quite some time, never knew that people in real life are sometimes different than they appear on paper. She only learns this when an incident occurs with one of the couples she matches. I mean, anyone who’s ever been on a dating site or watched a True Crime story should know that people can portray themselves as something that they’re not. Technically, she apparently does already know people lie on the questionnaire because she comments about guys lying about their height.  For her to apparently have this “revelation” that makes her reevaluate her priorities simply doesn’t track. While that bothers me Finish the article on AICN",

It just premiered at the 2025 Tribeca Film Festival and it will also play at the Locarno Film Festival in August. Kerouac's Road explores Jack Kerouac's iconic novel \"On the Road\" through today's lens, as celebrities \u0026 travelers reflect on authentic experiences in our digital age, echoing the novel's timeless search for genuine connection. The film introduces us to \"on-the-roaders\" and other fans of the book. Featuring Josh Brolin, W. Kamau Bell, Matt Dillon, and many more, it reveals a rarely seen side of Kerouac and offers a fresh take on On the Road and its lasting impact on America. In this modern era defined by screens and constant connectivity we can all still learn from the book and Kerouac’s journey, and what it means to engage in real time with the path we're on.

This new trailer is also a promo to reveal they'll have a panel at Florida Supercon convention - on July 19th. We also posted the first official trailer last year for this wacky horror mash-up, which still doesn't have a final release date set yet. \"Young People meet Outlaw Bikers meet feral Twin Psycho-killers in a notorious abandoned water park.\" Terror Twins LLC is making the film, which is described as an homage to horror cult classics like Evil Dead 2, Friday the 13th, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, etc. Also inspired by the infamous Action Park water park in New Jersey (profiled in this doc Class Action Park) that was actually very dangerous. Traction Park Massacre stars Kai Thomas Schulz, Bodhi Schulz, Helene Henry, and others.
