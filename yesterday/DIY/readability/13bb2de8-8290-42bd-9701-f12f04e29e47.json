That’s precisely what this IKEA vanity desk hack from Merve @interieurmerve does. The divided tray keeps items organized, and the glass top makes it a cinch to locate what you need within seconds. I love that this DIY project is a simple combination of a few IKEA items, and that’s it! There’s no laundry list of supplies, extra wood, paint, glue, specialized tools, etc. That means you can have an amazing vanity area in just a few easy-breezy steps.

What You’ll Need 2 IKEA ALEX drawer units (14 ⅛” x 27 ½”) 1 KOMPLEMENT pull-out shelf (39 ⅜” x 22 ⅞”) 1 KOMPLEMENT glass shelf (39 ⅜” x 22 ⅞”) 1 KOMPLEMENT divider for pull-out shelf (39 ⅜” x 22 ⅞”) Basics — Screw gun, drill, tape measure, pencil Sleek IKEA Vanity Desk With Tons of Storage and No Hassle 1. Assemble the ALEX Units Put together the two ALEX drawer units according to IKEA instructions. Merve opted for the white finish, but the ALEX is also available in black, dark gray, and a pretty black-blue color. Get whichever color works best with your space and style.  2. Add the Pull-Out Organizer There are a bunch of different hacks out there that turn the ALEX into a desk, but this vanity DIY nixes the need for a piece of wood or counter to use as a desktop. Instead, you simply install the KOMPLEMENT pull-out shelf between the two ALEX units. Measure carefully to line up the slides on the inside of each drawer unit so the shelf glides smoothly and evenly. Also, make sure to position the shelf down far enough to, at minimum, accommodate the height of the KOMPLEMENT divider. 3. Top It All Off With the Glass Shelf Once the pull-out shelf is in position, install shelf supports onto each ALEX unit for the KOMPLEMENT glass shelf. Place the supports slightly below the top, so the glass shelf sits flush with the ALEX units once it’s in place. What’s the Cost of This IKEA Vanity Desk? The finished dressing table looks like one, purposeful piece of furniture, even though it’s composed of several different IKEA products. I think it’s brilliant how Merve used a pull-out shelf and a stationary glass shelf to create the illusion of one continual top across the ALEX drawers. The real kicker is that this IKEA dressing table stays relatively affordable at less than $300. The ALEX drawers are normally $90 each, the KOMPLEMENT shelves are $40 each, and the divider is $25.  However, you can always find gently used pieces on online sites, like Facebook Marketplace. The ALEX drawers are a hot item there; I see them quite often. So if you want the price tag to come in even lower, scope out some secondhand options first. Save Time Getting Ready With Even More Organization I am obsessed with anything that has a bunch of storage, so that’s another reason I love this hack. The KOMPLEMENT shelf with the divider may be the focus of this project, but don’t forget about all of the storage you get in the ALEX drawers.  Get some acrylic drawer organizers to maximize these spaces even more. You can corral makeup, hair accessories, jewelry, and even small clothing items in these units, shaving time off of your get-ready routine. Want to Do It Differently? You could make plenty of tweaks to put your own spin on this IKEA vanity makeup table hack. Here are a few ideas: Similar to the ALEX drawers, the KOMPLEMENT items also come in several colors, so consider various combos if you’re looking for a different style. If you don’t like the idea of seeing inside the drawer, you could also opt for a solid shelf instead of the glass one for your topper. Another option is lining the pull-out shelf with a fun wallpaper or contact paper for a vibrant or quirky detail. You could use matching paper inside the drawers or on top of the ALEX units. If you need a mobile dressing table, add wheels to the bottom (4 under each ALEX) to move the vanity wherever you need it. What would you do to make this hack just right for your space?
