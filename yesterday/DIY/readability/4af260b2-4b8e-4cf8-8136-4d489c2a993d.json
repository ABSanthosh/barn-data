While I love our delivery chicken wing order, it is nice to know how to make your favorite meals at home. These crispy oven baked chicken wings are healthier, less expensive and just as tasty as take out. You‚Äôre going to love them. Homemade chicken wings can be deep fried, oven baked or even air fried, but the recipe I am sharing here is all about getting super crispy wings with minimal effort and no special equipment beyond a baking sheet and oven. This chicken wings recipe taste great as is or with your favorite dipping sauce. Related: If you own an air fryer, you may also want to learn how to make air fryer chicken wings! Ingredients Chicken wings ‚Äì sometimes called ‚Äúparty wings‚Äù Baking powder Salt and black pepper Seasoning* Olive oil ‚Äì or other cooking oil *For seasoning, I often use a mix called ‚ÄúPappy‚Äôs‚Äù that I like, but you can use literally any seasoning mix or make your own. And if you want to keep it simple, just stick with some good old Lawry‚Äôs seasoning salt. You may also want some sauce to toss your wings in after baking, like: buffalo sauce, BBQ sauce, hot sauce like Frank‚Äôs or any other wing sauce you prefer. I also serve them with a side of ranch dressing if I use a hot sauce. How to Bake Chicken Wings I very much prefer buying wings that are already segmented; sometimes these are labeled as ‚Äúparty wings.‚Äù But, if needed, you can segment chicken wings yourself into three parts: tips (discard or use in another recipe like homemade stock), drumettes, and flats or wingettes. In a small bowl, mix together the baking powder, salt, pepper and any seasoning you are using. Pat the pieces of chicken dry. Then toss them in the dry rub mix. Lightly oil a baking sheet and place the chicken wings in one layer. It‚Äôs OK if they touch a little, but they should not overlap. If needed, use more than one baking sheet. Bake in the oven at 425¬∞F for 20 minutes. Then flip each piece, and lightly brush in oil. Bake for another 20 minutes (40 minutes total). Remove from the baking sheet and serve warm. You could also toss these in your favorite sauce if you like, using 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup of sauce. Tips \u0026 Notes If you want a specific spice mix beyond salt and pepper, try this: 1/4 teaspoon seasoning salt, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika and then 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper. I typically serve one pound of chicken wings per adult. This recipe is for two pounds so this is what my husband and I would make for dinner, plus carrots and celery for a fresh crunch on the side. üôÇ Line your baking sheet with aluminum foil for even easier clean up. Not as crispy as you like? Broil them for a minute or two. I don‚Äôt usually find this necessary, but every oven is a little different. Store any leftovers in an airtight container for up to three days. I will rewarm in the microwave or air fryer. This works best for wings that haven‚Äôt been drenched in sauce.
