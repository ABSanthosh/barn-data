All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Thrift shopping has surged in popularity over the past few years — even the most reluctant shopper has a chance to win big on a one-of-a-kind gem. But figuring out what’s high-quality and what won’t last much longer is hard for even seasoned thrifters to do, especially when it comes to highly desirable wood furniture.“Hardwood pieces last much longer, feel more substantial, and can easily be refinished if you ever want a different color,” Thea Bloch-Neal, founder and lead designer of Curated by Thea. “They’re an investment worth making.”So what’s a determined treasure hunter to do? For starters, practice identifying quality wood furniture upon first sight — well, in the minutes following first sight, at least. To help hone your skills, I tapped three DIY professionals who shared their tips for pinpointing quality wood furniture at the thrift store so that your future searches can uncover pieces to be proud of. The best part? Training your eye is easier than you’d think. Sniff out any signs of particleboard.Renee Bruner, the creator behind Renee Renovates, says that one of the easiest ways to determine if a piece of furniture is built to last is to inspect whether it’s made of particleboard, an engineered wood that’s usually called MDF (aka medium-density fiberboard). It often resembles cardboard, but is slightly more firm. “Many new wood furnishings are now made to look like authentic vintage pieces but they actually just have a nice wood veneer slapped on a particleboard core,” Bruner says. “The best place to check for particleboard is on the back and underside of the piece. Don’t be afraid to flip a piece over to look.” You can also spot this material because of its laminate edges. To be fair, there are plenty of reasons to seek out MDF for a project, particularly if you’re in the market for a good hack. “There is a time and place for ‘fake’ wood, like most IKEA furniture, and sometimes it’s simply because that’s what’s available and affordable,” says Drew Michael Scott of Lone Fox. “However, it’s important to know that fake wood won’t offer the same level of quality and won’t handle wear and tear as well as solid wood. Fake wood will feel ultra smooth and plasticky, and if you look closely, you can usually see pixels from it being printed.”Pay close attention to the joinery.Another simple way to check a piece of furniture’s quality is to zero in on its joinery, aka the details of how the piece was put together (hopefully way back when). “If it has slotted screws instead of Phillips heads, the piece may be pre-mid-century, which is a good indicator that it will be made of solid wood and better quality,” Bruner says. “If it uses more advanced woodworking techniques, like dovetails or mortise-and-tenon joints, that’s a great sign that it’s a high-quality piece.”As you shop, open drawers to notice how the pieces fit together, and don’t forget to take a closer look at its feet. If it appears as though a lot of attention was paid to the parts that won’t be seen as often, that likely means that it’s made with care. Listen for a specific sound.Bloch-Neal isn’t afraid to make a little noise whenever she’s determining if a furnishing is made of solid hardwood. “Give it a knock — real wood has a sturdier, denser feel,” she says. Pieces that are of a lesser quality will have a quieter sound. It’s almost as if they’re whispering for you to keep moving. When you find a wood table or vanity, for instance, go ahead and use this test. A high-quality item should sound exactly like a classic knock from an old television show. Show your strength.“Pick it up. If it’s heavy, that’s a good sign,” Bloch-Neal says. You don’t have to go out of your way to push the piece above your head, but if you don’t have a problem lifting, say, a dining table a few inches off the ground, then that may indicate that it’s not going to last as many Thanksgivings as you’d hope. Check for a maker’s mark.If you’re shopping at a thrift store that advertises its collection of vintage furniture, one way to be sure of that is by identifying a particular detail. “Flip the piece over or look inside for a brand seal — you can often look up the maker online for more details,” Bloch-Neal says. There’s a chance that a long-ago carpenter or company left their mark on the finished piece (in fact, they’re often referred to as maker’s marks), akin to a painter signing their work. When you’ve spotted one, you’ll know it was made to last. Don’t completely ignore veneer.While shiny furniture may be a sign of lower quality, that finish shouldn’t be used as a blanket reason for you to pass on it. “When it comes to more expensive woods like burl wood or walnut, the piece is often built from a less expensive wood with a thin layer of wood veneer on top. This gives the appearance of solid burl wood or walnut, but the cost is lower,” Scott says. Shopping for veneered pieces ultimately depends on what you’re hoping to create in your space. “Just because a piece has a veneer layer doesn’t mean it’s of lesser quality, so don’t let that deter you,” Scott continues. “Even the most high-end designers use veneered pieces, so you’ll be in good company!”",
