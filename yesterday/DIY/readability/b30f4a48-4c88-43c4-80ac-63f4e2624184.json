Affordable IKEA Kitchen Peninsula Photo Credit: Jill @jillyshumblehome | Instagram The foundation of Jill’s kitchen peninsula is a 2×2 KALLAX unit, elevated to kitchen island height with adjustable cabinet legs, sourced from B\u0026Q. Then, she built a frame out of 2×2 wood, measuring 15 cm deep and 77 cm long, to securely attach the MDF boards at the bottom of the KALLAX unit. She set the frame back by 9 mm to accommodate the thickness of the MDF, ensuring a flush fit. For the outer structure, Jill used pre-cut MDF sheets. The main sheet measures 93 cm wide by 91 cm high, which not only covers the KALLAX unit but also extends slightly beyond it for added coverage. The side panels are each 39 cm wide by 91 cm tall.“If I wanted this part to just cover the unit, I would only need it to be 77 cm wide, but I wanted it to cover the unit and a little more,” Jill notes. The boards are glued to the KALLAX and secured with nails. Kitchen Peninsula With Faux Marble Worktop The worktop (122 cm x 116 cm) overhangs the unit by about 15 inches on each side, providing adequate space for meal prep or casual dining. The supporting MDF around the KALLAX unit is 9 mm thick, while the shaker-style MDF is a more delicate 4 mm thick, adding detail to the overall design.She used small angle brackets to fasten the worktop to the KALLAX and larger ones to fix the worktop to the wall. This step helps with stability and ensures the worktop is well-supported. Finally, she covered the MDF worktop with a marble vinyl wrap. Painting the Peninsula To achieve a smooth finish, Jill caulked and sanded all joints and seams. She then used a Zinsser B.I.N. Primer and Valspar Eggshell paint for wood and metal, color-matched to Purbeck Stone. A final step was to seal all around the base of the peninsula with clear silicone to protect the MDF from moisture when cleaning the kitchen floor. Jill’s KALLAX peninsula has sparked inspiration among many DIYers, proving that this accessible project is within reach for anyone willing to give it a go.
