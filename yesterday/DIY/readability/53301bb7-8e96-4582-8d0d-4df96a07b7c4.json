  "text": "Netflix Sign in to your MUO account Netflix Just in time for the holiday season, Netflix has launched three new virtual fireplaces. These are based on some of the streaming service's most popular shows, all last for an hour, and all contain Easter eggs for fans of the shows to spot. Netflix Launches New Fireplaces Based on Popular Shows Netflix has added three new virtual fireplaces to its lineup. These join the existing virtual fireplaces, giving Netflix subscribers even more options when they want to have a crackling fireplace playing in the background. The first of Netflix's new fireplaces is based on Squid Game, a show whose season two is launching on December 26th. The fireplace is set in the Front Man's office, and boasts several objects that should be familiar to fans of the show. This includes the green telephone used to set the games in motion, a miniature version of the creepy doll from the Red Light, Green Light game, and two armed guards keeping watch. Next up is a fireplace set in the world of the period drama Bridgerton. You'll be able to see the fireplace set in the Bridgerton family's living room, with Lady Whistledown's quill pen, a folded copy of one of her letters, and a bouquet of wisteria. The whole scene reeks of old school high society, which is befitting for a scene inspired by this particular show. Last but not least is a roaring campfire set in the magical wilderness of Lumbria, the fantasy kingdom from the movie Spellbound. While it may not be a virtual fireplace, it still pays homage to one of Netflix's original and exclusive productions. While watching the campfire burn away, you can listen to the score from the film. These Virtual Fireplaces Are One of My Guilty Pleasures To be absolutely honest, as much as I may have given this article a slightly mocking title, these virtual fireplaces are a guilty pleasure of mine. Every single year, as the weather turns colder, and the nights start drawing in, I search Netflix for \"fireplace\" and have one playing in the background. Not only does it get me in the holiday mood almost as much as chatting to Santa through ChatGPT does, it also makes me feel a little warmer both inside and out. To find Netflix's new virtual fireplaces, just search on Netflix for \"fireplace\" and you should find all of the above alongside the fireplaces that have existed on the streaming service for years now. You can also search for the specific fireplace you're after by adding the name of the show. And if you also subscribe to YouTube TV, you should check out its new Zen Channel full of relaxing clips.",
