With just a few inexpensive materials and minimal effort, Jeff has created the KALLAX Vinyl Record Shelf Stopper, a hack that prevents records from sliding too far back in the cubes.Jeff’s motivation for creating this hack was simple: “I was tired of the records sliding too far back whenever I put another record onto the shelf.” With the KALLAX vinyl backspacer, vinyl enthusiasts can now enjoy a tidy record collection lined up neatly without the hassle of constantly adjusting their albums. Best of all, it’s extremely easy to hack. Here’s what you need to do: Materials and Tools: Photo Credit: Home Depot KALLAX shelving unit Clear Gorilla Glue Hand saw or chop saw Lowe’s or Home Depot’s Polystyrene White Case Moulding 9/16″ x 2 1/4″ x 96″ KALLAX Vinyl Record Shelf Stopper / Backspacer Cut molding to required length | Photo Credit: Jeff Richards 1. Jeff used a Polystyrene White Case Moulding, which he cut into 13 1/4″ long pieces using a hand saw or chop saw to fit the width of the KALLAX shelf. Glue to the back of the shelf | Photo Credit: Jeff Richards 2. He applied glue to the back of the molding and aligned it to the edge of the shelf. The lip of the molding should hug the edge for a clean finish. “It takes very little glue and it will dry overnight perfectly,” Jeff explains. “As long as the pieces lay flat, they will not need clamping.” Let dry | Photo Credit: Jeff Richards 3. Fill shelves with records. The hack is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. “It looks like it was made that way,” Jeff says. “It works perfectly and keeps your record collection looking its best.” Line up vinyls against stopper | Photo Credit: Jeff Richards One of the best aspects of this hack is its affordability and ease of execution. According to Jeff, “Nothing was hard. This is a fifteen-minute project that lasts forever.” The materials cost just $6.96 for a piece of 8-foot-long molding. The amount needed depends on the number of KALLAX cubes in use. With 8 feet of polystyrene molding, you can create seven pieces.We love how neatly his records sit on the KALLAX cubes. This hack is also a good one for lining up paperbacks and books on the KALLAX or BILLY bookcase. What do you think?
