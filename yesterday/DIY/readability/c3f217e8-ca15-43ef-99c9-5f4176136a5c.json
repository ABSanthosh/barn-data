Google's recent efforts into the Find Hub are finally paying off as this tracker gets AirTag-like accuracy with Ultra-Wideband support. Motorola’s Flagship Tracker Finally Gets UWB Support A year after launch, the Moto Tag, Motorola's flagship tracker, now supports UWB tracking. This is also the first Find Hub (previously known as Find My Device) tracker that supports UWB for Android. However, if you've got a Moto Tag lying around, it's not magically going to become easier to track. First, you need to update the Moto Tag app to the 01.00.073.10-Release version. The updated app version is slowly rolling out via the Play Store, but if you don't want to wait, you can sideload an updated version from APKMirror at your own risk. The next step is to update the firmware of your Moto Tag itself, which is only accessible from the updated app. This new update, version 2.0.93, is the first to come out since version 2.0.69 was released in early 2025. Changelogs for the new update clearly state that it includes UWB functionality, and APKMirror owner Artem Russakovskii has confirmed that the update includes the much-anticipated UWB functionality. Once the Moto Tag is updated, you should be able to access UWB tracking in the Find Hub. Of course, you will have to update to the new Find Hub app as well in case you haven't already. If the installation goes right, you'll be able to see directional arrows and distance to your Moto Tag. This isn't the easiest process to follow through, especially considering each Moto Tag needs to be updated individually. There are other hurdles to UWB tracking as well, including smartphone capability, which is often limited to flagship Android devices. UWB tracking on the Moto Tag seems to work as expected, but the user experience is far from the seamless tracking Apple provides. Both the AirTag and Moto Tag offer similar features, and both tags are priced at $29, so the difference boils down to the user experience and whether you're using an Android or an iPhone. Related Google's Tracking App Finally Gets the One Feature Everyone Has Asked For It's making sharing your location with your friends and family much easier. One benefit of Apple's walled garden is that the user experience is consistent across the board, including when using AirTag. Android, on the other hand, has plenty of options for trackers, all with varying features and price points. However, this means the user experience and tracking accuracy can be significantly different as well. You can try using an AirTag on an Android phone, but the functionality is quite limited. Android still has a long way to go when it comes to trackers, but the Moto Tag is a good start. Now that the Find Hub, and by extension Android, finally have a UWB tracker on hand, more manufacturers will follow up with their own devices and experiences. Adding UWB to the Moto Tag may not be enough to beat the AirTag, but it certainly opens the floodgates for different companies to release more UWB compatible trackers on the market.",

First, you need to update the Moto Tag app to the 01.00.073.10-Release version. The updated app version is slowly rolling out via the \u003ca href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2036906/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.motorola.tag\u0026amp;hl=en_US\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePlay Store\u003c/a\u003e, but if you don\u0026#39;t want to wait, you can sideload an updated version from \u003ca href=\"https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/motorola-mobility-llc/moto-tag/moto-tag-01-00-073-10-release-release/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAPKMirror\u003c/a\u003e at your own risk.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe next step is to update the firmware of your Moto Tag itself, which is only accessible from the updated app. This new update, version 2.0.93, is the first to come out since version 2.0.69 was released in early 2025. Changelogs for the new update clearly state that it includes UWB functionality, and APKMirror owner Artem Russakovskii has confirmed that the update includes the much-anticipated UWB functionality.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n    \n\u003cp\u003eOnce the Moto Tag is updated, you should be able to access UWB tracking in the Find Hub.

Both the AirTag and Moto Tag offer similar features, and both tags are priced at $29, so the difference boils down to the user experience and whether you\u0026#39;re using an Android or an

experience is consistent across the board, including when using AirTag. Android, on the other hand, has plenty of options for trackers, all with varying features and price points. However, this means the user experience and tracking accuracy can be significantly different as well.

Now that the Find Hub, and by extension Android, finally have a UWB tracker on hand, more manufacturers will follow up with their own devices and experiences. Adding UWB to the Moto Tag may not be enough to beat the AirTag, but it certainly opens the floodgates for different companies to release more UWB compatible trackers on the market.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
