  "text": "Sign in to your MUO account Yadullah Abidi / MakeUseOf Microsoft is handing out free AI lessons—not only to help you write better prompts but also to set a new world record. Sure, you might be helping Microsoft reach its goal, but you can actually learn a heap of really useful stuff on the way. What Is Microsoft's Free AI Training All About? Microsoft is running its 50-day AI Skills Fest from April 8 to May 28, 2025. It includes live events, in-person training, self-paced lessons, hackathons, and more. The sessions cover topics catering to all skill levels. Beginners can take introductory classes on AI and learn core concepts like machine learning or natural language processing. Microsoft's AI tools, like Copilot, Fabric, and Azure, are also being taught. If you're already well-versed in AI, there are advanced lessons and even an AI Agent Hackathon to create \"AI-powered solutions using AI agents.\" The lessons are available in over 30 languages and cater to both regional and global audiences, so there's something for everyone here. The overall idea is that you'll find something worth your time regardless of your skill level in AI. You can start with easier-to-understand, early-stage classes or pick something more in-depth. Regardless, the entire experience is packaged as one course where people can pick and choose the lessons they want. Some of Microsoft's paid courses are free during the AI fest, but you'll still have to pay for the certification. Related Microsoft's 7 AI Copilots and Which One You Should Use Looking for an AI assistant to aid you with day-to-day life, work, or business? Microsoft Copilot always has you covered. That's where the Microsoft AI Skills Fest Challenge Sweepstakes comes in. These are weekly draws with 50,000 free certification vouchers on offer. All you have to do is start one of the qualifying AI Skills Fest challenges and fill out a form on the page linked above. All non-winning entries automatically roll over to the next draw, so you only need to enter once. You Can Be Part of a Guinness World Record, Too The highlight of Microsoft's AI fest is its attempt to set a Guinness World Record title for \"the most users to complete an online multi-level artificial intelligence lesson in 24 hours.\" The event runs from April 7, 23:00 UTC, to April 8, 23:00 UTC. There are over 30 sessions listed on the challenge website that qualify you as a participant for the feat. These include prompt writing classes, sessions on understanding how to use generative AI at home or work, and classes on how to build AI agents in Copilot, among others. The best part? Registering for a course and completing it before the April 8 deadline makes you eligible to download a record attempt badge. The catch is that you'll have to authorize Microsoft as a proxy for an agreement with Guinness World Records. The AI Skills Fest Registration page also has a statement clarifying this: If I participate in the AI Skills Fest Event world record attempt, I hereby authorize Microsoft to act as my representative and to enter into the applicable agreement with Guinness World Records on my behalf and I acknowledge that I have reviewed the applicable terms of the Guinness World Records Terms and Conditions. The world record attempt may be a marketing gimmick, but you and I can get some real value out of this event. AI is a hot topic, and Microsoft is a tech giant with significant skin in the game. Getting free training, even if it's to write better prompts, can go a long way.",

These include prompt writing classes, sessions on understanding how to use generative AI at home or work, and classes on how to build AI agents in Copilot, among others.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe best part? Registering for a course and completing it before the April 8 deadline makes you eligible to download a record attempt badge. The catch is that you\u0026#39;ll have to authorize Microsoft as a proxy for an agreement with Guinness World Records.
