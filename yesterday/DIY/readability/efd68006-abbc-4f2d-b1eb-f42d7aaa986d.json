  "text": "Sign in to your MUO account Your Android device has a new system app called SafetyCore, which is raising some serious privacy issues. Designed to protect against certain types of content, SafetyCore has extensive access to your device—which is precisely why you may want to remove it. What Is the Android System SafetyCore App? SafetyCore is a system app developed by Google for Android devices running Android 9 or higher, which began rolling out in November 2024. Since it's a system app that works in the background, you won't find it in the app drawer. You'll need to go to Settings \u003e Apps \u003e System Apps to check if it's installed on your device. The main function of SafetyCore is to warn you about potentially sensitive images in Google Messages. If you receive a picture that may contain nudity, SafetyCore automatically blurs it to prevent you from accidental exposure. Before viewing, you'll see a warning message with options to proceed or ignore it. Likewise, if you attempt to send or forward a nude image, SafetyCore reminds you of the risks to prevent accidental or unsafe sharing. Mojahid Mottakin/Shutterstock Google ensures that SafetyCore processes everything locally on your device, meaning no data is uploaded to external servers. Additionally, the app only scans images sent or received through Google Messages, so you don't have to worry about it scanning every photo or video on your device. However, the fact that SafetyCore scans images—even if limited to messaging—raises concerns. Feeling uneasy about a system-level app analyzing images is natural, especially one that installed itself in the background, required no permissions, and has almost complete access to your device. How to Stop Android System SafetyCore From Scanning Your Photos While Google positions SafetyCore as a protective feature, those prioritizing privacy may feel uncomfortable, no matter how limited or well-intentioned it claims to be (though, as above, having anything installed without warning isn't pleasant). The good news is that SafetyCore is optional, meaning you can uninstall or disable it like any other app on your phone. Doing so won't affect your phone's functionality in any way. To remove the Android System SafetyCore app from your device, use these steps: Open the Settings menu on your Android phone. Scroll down to tap Apps. Tap the filter and sort icon and enable the Show system apps toggle. On some devices, you'll need to tap the three-dot menu and select Show system apps. Scroll through the list or use the search tool to find Android System SafetyCore on the list and tap on it. Tap Uninstall at the bottom and hit OK to confirm. And that's about it! Once you remove the SafetyCore app, you won't have to worry about it scanning your messages or private files. Keep in mind that Android SafetyCore may automatically reinstall or re-enable itself, especially after a system update. To ensure it stays off your device, you'll need to regularly check the list of installed apps on your phone and disable or remove it again if needed.",
