  "text": "Sign in to your How-To Geek account There's an endless supply of great TV available to stream, but with 20+ episode seasons, and multiple seaons to boot, many of them can be tough to get into if you're short on time. A mini-series, on the other hand, tells a more substantial story than a movie, but usually only has one season and about 7-10 hours of content. Perfect for watching a complete yet meaty narrative before you have to go back to work or school on Monday. So here are ten mini-series I think represent the best of the format. This is not a ranked list. 10 Band of Brothers (MAX) Release Year 2001 Episodes 10 Status Ended Created by Stephen Spielberg and Tom Hanks, Band of Brothers is one of the best war series ever made, and I'd even rate it above Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. It follows the exploits of Easy Company, from boot camp to the heat of the war. It's an amazing account of the Normandy landing, the Siege of Bastogne, liberation of camps in WWII, and the taking of the Nazi Eagle's nest. The cast is absolutely stellar, and you'll learn to love or hate certain characters based on the strength of the performances alone. If you have any interest in war dramas at all, but somehow haven't seen this series, it's time to correct that. It's also probably time for me to finally buy a physical copy, come to think of it. Band of Brothers This is still one of the best examples of a war story put to film, with a poignant and often heartwarming depiction of Easy Company and the horros of World War II. 9 Chernobyl (MAX) Release Year 2019 Episodes 5 Status Ended Apart from my own birth, I guess the other notable thing that happened in 1986 was the nuclear disaster in Chernobyl, which is also the simple and to-the-point title of this show. Chernobyl is a masterclass in storytelling, and quite possibly the best attempt ever to convey the gravity and horror of the event. This was a disaster that left a permanent scar on our collective consciousness, and it's probably the main reason nuclear power has fallen out of favor across the world, despite its promise for clean energy. It's also a fantastic portrayal of how Russian politics of the day bump up against reality and the very different priorities of politicians when human lives should weigh the heaviest on the scale. It's not the easiest watch, given the subject matter, but it's a show that absolutely everyone should watch, if for no other reasons than the lessons embedded in this story. Chernobyl The thrilling tale of arguably the greatest nuclear disaster in human history, and how the communist government of the USSR weighed up the realities of a nuclear meltdown against its political interests. 8 The Queen's Gambit (Netflix) Release Year 2020 Episodes 7 Status Ended I was the chess team captain a few times during my school career, though in truth I'm pretty terrible at the game. Luckily, you don't need to know much or anything about chess at all to enjoy The Queen's Gambit. It tells the story of an orphaned girl who picks up both the game and a substance addiction during her stay at the orphanage. After she's adopted, her talent for chess propels her towards fame and fortune, but with that comes the temptation and opportunity to indulge in her darker hobby. It's a slick bit of TV, and pretty fresh thanks to the board game angle. If you thought this was just going to be about stuffy chess tournaments, you should absolutely give it a look. The Queen's Gambit An orphaned chess prodigy dreams of becoming an elite champion, but has to deal with emotional problems and substance abuse issues, not to mention the reality of being a woman in the 1960s. 7 Shōgun (Hulu) Release Year 2024 Episodes 10 Status Ongoing (Sort of) This is the second time that Shōgun has been adapted as a mini-series, and you can easily watch the 1980 series today as well. Based on the novel by James Clavell, it tells the story of John Blackthorne. An Englishman who finds his ship and crew captured by the Japanese at a time when the country was very much closed to all but a select few foreigners. To make things worse, Japan is going through a severe political crisis and is effectively on the brink of civil war, with Blackthorne alternating between fighting for his life, and finding a place of honor in a culture he struggles to understand. Everything in this show, from the acting to the cinematography, is worth your time. Even if, like me, you aren't particularly fond of Samurai period dramas. Note, that I say the series is \"sort of\" ongoing, and that's because if a second season does happen it will be set many years after this show, and have none of the same characters. Making it more of an anthology. Shōgun A brilliant adaptation of the famous book, Shōgun tells the story of an Englishman who finds himself stranded in the strange land of Japan before it opens up to the Western world. Right in the middle of a major political dispute. 6 WandaVision (Disney Plus) Release Year 2021 Episodes 9 Status Ended I'll preface this by saying that if you aren't already familiar with characters like the Scarlett Witch and The Vision, then WandaVision will have less of an impact, and less appeal than it might otherwise. Yet, I'm sure that there are plenty of people who have seen the big-budget movies featuring these characters, but who never touch Marvel's TV productions. If that's you, then if you're going to watch any Marvel TV show, it should be WandaVision. Sorry Loki, as much as I love you, if I had to choose this is the show I'd recommend. The big problem is that so much of the show depends on you not knowing any of the plot, so I can't really say too much without spoiling it all, but I will say that this is both a technical masterclass in reproducing TV show aesthetics from various eras and in the art of surrealism. Wanda and Vision are living an idyllic life with their two children in a small town, but if you know how the Avenger's movies ended for Wanda and Vision, then how is this possible? The fun is in finding out. WandaVision The Scarlett Witch is living a happy life with The Vision and their two children, but how can that be? What's really going on in this sleepy little town? 5 Watchmen (Max) Release Year 2019 Episodes 9 Status Ended The Watchmen movie is a flawed masterpiece and a cult classic, despite Alan Moore (the original comic creator) disavowing it. It's one of those movies where I usually would say there's no need for a sequel, but the TV series which is set after the events of the film is a thoughtful exploration of the aftermath, and a show with a clear message of its own. Just like the film, this isn't really about the action-packed exploits of masked heroes, and the premise that all police officers should now also wear masks is a fascinating idea to explore. If you watched the original movie, you need to see this. If you haven't, I recommend watching the movie first. Watchmen A brilliant, thought-proviking follow-up to the cult-classic Watchmen film, in turn an adaptation of the cult-classic comic.If you loved Watchment the movie (and you should see it first) then the TV series is a must-see. 4 Adolescence (Netflix) Release Year 2025 Episodes 4 Status Ended (Maybe) Loosely-based on real-world events. Adolescence tells the story of a boy who is detained on suspicion of killing a female classmate, and the consequences of both the killing and his interrogation. It's harrowing, and uncovers the ugly underbelly of a certain toxic online culture that pokes up its head far too often these days. Not for those with a weak constitution, but a short and powerful piece of visual storytelling that won't leave you unmoved. Adolescence A harrowing crime drama about a boy accused of murdering a classmate. While detained, the truth of how the boy's views of the world have been twisted come to light, and his family must deal with the stigma. 3 Midnight Mass (Netflix) Release Year 2021 Episodes 7 Status Ended I didn't think much of Midnight Mass at first, and I wasn't even the one who put it on. I was basically watching it over my wife's shoulder as she got into it, but after the first two episodes I was pretty much as hooked as she was. This is what the kids call a \"slow burn\", but the pacing and sense of relentless dread is exactly why this horror series is so good. A man returns to his isolated island town after struggling with his own demons in the outside world. However, instead of finding a place where he can heal and rebuild his life, his hometown is somehow strange now. Weird things are happening, and the young and friendly new priest seems to be connected to it all, though the people in his congregation seem to love him. Dark, shocking, and at times incredibly violent, you might want to keep the lights on for this one. Midnight Mass An isolated island community, a strange young priest, and a man struggling with demons brought back from the outside world. Now, strange things are happening, and the truth is more horrifying than you can imagine. 2 Baby Reindeer (Netflix) Release Year 2024 Episodes 7 Status Ongoing/Ended/Canceled Baby Reindeer has an interesting wrinkle outside of the show itself, since the creators are in hot water following a judge's ruling that it's \"based on a true story\" claim is too far from the truth, and could be damaging to the reputation of one of the character's real life inspirations. So, if you watch it, keep in mind that this is heavily fictionalized. That said, the story of how a small-time comedian is stalked by a fan, while also suffering abuse at the hands of the showbiz industry is gripping and darkly funny as only the best dark comedies manage to be. There's a warning about the dangers of parasocial relationships there as well, but you don't have to dig through all the layers to enjoy this one. Baby Reindeer Netflix's show claims to be based on a true story, but a court has ruled this is more fiction than reality, yet this black comedy remains a brilliant and disturbing look into stalking, and the abuses of show business. 1 True Detective Season 1(Max) Release Year 2014 Episodes 8 Status Ongoing I know I said that this isn't a ranked list, and it isn't, but True Detective Season 1 is indeed the best show on this list. At least in my opinion. I'm making this about the first season specifically for two reasons. First, this is an anthology show, so there's no connection between the seasons. Each is effectively its own mini series. Second, nothing this show has done since or other police dramas have done comes anywhere close to the first season of True Detective. This is the hardest one to describe without spoiling it, but suffice it to say that this is a mind-bending crime show that won't turn out the way you think it will, and has characters so complex you could write a book about each one. True Detective Season 1 As close to perfect TV as you can get, the first seasons of this anthology franchise is a genre-defining masterpiece. With enigmatic morally-gray characters and mind-bending philosophy, interspersed with the confrontation of true evil in the quest to solve a brutal murder. Don't miss this one. These series are mini, but mighty. It really shows that there's a great sweet spot between the length of a movie and the length of a full series. Also, since these are such short shows, you can watch them multiple times, which makes them excellent candidates for physical disc collection. Now, the weekend awaits, so take your pick and press play,",

Chernobyl is a masterclass in storytelling, and quite possibly the best attempt ever to convey the gravity and horror of the event. This was a disaster that left a permanent scar on our collective consciousness, and it\u0026#39;s probably the main reason nuclear power has fallen out of favor across the world, despite its promise for clean energy.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s also a fantastic portrayal of how Russian politics of the day bump up against reality and the very different priorities of politicians when human lives should weigh the heaviest on the scale.

Yet, I\u0026#39;m sure that there are plenty of people who have seen the big-budget movies featuring these characters, but who never touch Marvel\u0026#39;s TV productions.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf that\u0026#39;s you, then if you\u0026#39;re going to watch any Marvel TV show, it should be WandaVision. Sorry \u003cem\u003eLoki\u003c/em\u003e, as much as I love you, if I had to choose this is the show I\u0026#39;d recommend. The big problem is that so much of the show depends on you not knowing any of the plot, so I can\u0026#39;t really say too much without spoiling it all, but I will say that this is both a technical masterclass in reproducing TV show aesthetics from various eras and in the art of surrealism. Wanda and Vision are living an idyllic life with their two children in a small town, but if you know how the Avenger\u0026#39;s movies ended for Wanda and Vision, then how is this possible?

It\u0026#39;s one of those movies where I usually would say there\u0026#39;s no need for a sequel, but the TV series which is set after the events of the film is a thoughtful exploration of the aftermath, and a show with a clear message of its own.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eJust like the film, this isn\u0026#39;t really about the action-packed exploits of masked heroes, and the premise that all police officers should now also wear masks is a fascinating idea to explore.

list. At least in my opinion. I\u0026#39;m making this about the first season specifically for two reasons. First, this is an anthology show, so there\u0026#39;s no connection between the seasons. Each is effectively its own mini series. Second, nothing this show has done since or other police dramas have done comes anywhere close to the first season of True Detective.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThis is the hardest one to describe without spoiling it, but suffice it to say that this is a mind-bending crime show that won\u0026#39;t turn out the way you think it will, and has characters so complex you could write a book
