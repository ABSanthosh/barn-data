Users can initiate downloads on tablets, laptops \u0026 smartwatches directly from the main Spotify app. Spotify now includes a \"Manage Downloads\" section for easier management of downloaded content. The ability to download playlists for offline listening is one of the best things about Spotify Premium. However, Android Spotify users have been slightly behind their iPhone counterparts. Thankfully, Spotify is rectifying that with a recent update. For a while now, Apple users have had an advantage when it comes to remotely managing their Spotify downloads. They could push content to their Apple Watch from the Spotify app on their iPhone with the tap of a button. If you were on an Android phone, however, you could only download offline content on the device you were currently using. So, to have offline music on your Wear OS watch, you’d need to go through the hassle of navigating the Spotify app on your tiny wrist screen. Spotify has quietly launched a new feature that lets you initiate downloads to other devices directly from the main Spotify app on your phone. That includes your smartwatches, tablets, and even laptops can now receive playlists and podcasts with a few taps on your phone. It’s a simple change, but it makes things much easier. Related Spotify's Coolest Feature Feels Neglected If Spotify is focused on one thing, it's personalizing the music listening experience–for better or worse. The Spotify DJ is one of the coolest ways it does this, but it could be so, so much better. So, how does it work? You simply tap the three-dot menu icon next to any playlist, album, or podcast, and you’ll see a new option: “Download to other devices.” You’ll then see a list of devices attached to your Spotify account. As you can see from my screenshot, it's pulling in my smartwatch, tablet, computers, and phones. Select one of the devices and your content will magically appear on it the next time it connects to the internet. Pretty slick. In addition, Spotify has also introduced a \"Manage Downloads\" section. When you’re bumping up against Spotify’s five-device download limit, you can now see exactly where all your downloaded content is stored. You can remove it remotely, freeing up space without having to jump from device to device. This new tab only appears after you've download content to other devices. These may not be revolutionary updates, but for a certain type of Spotify user, it’s a massive quality-of-life improvement. For Android users especially, it makes preparing for those moments when you're without an internet connection far less of a chore—and more even with Apple users. Source: TechRadar Related I Tried Apple Music, But One Feature Brought Me Back to Spotify I recently made the big switch from Spotify to Apple Music, hoping for a less frustrating experience. Despite liking quite a bit about Apple Music, I found myself returning to Spotify after only two months. There was one feature I just couldn't live without.",

You simply tap the three-dot menu icon next to any playlist, album, or podcast, and you’ll see a new option: “Download to other devices.” You’ll then see a list of devices attached to your Spotify account. As you can see from my screenshot, it\u0026#39;s pulling in my smartwatch, tablet, computers, and phones. Select one of the devices and your content will magically appear on it the next time it connects to the internet. Pretty slick.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                \n    \n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, Spotify has also introduced a \u0026#34;Manage Downloads\u0026#34; section. When you’re bumping up against Spotify’s five-device download limit, you can now see exactly where all your downloaded content is stored. You can remove it remotely, freeing up space without having to jump from device to device. This new tab only appears after you\u0026#39;ve download content to other devices.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThese may not be revolutionary updates, but for a certain type of Spotify user, it’s a massive quality-of-life improvement. For Android users especially, it makes preparing for those moments when you\u0026#39;re without an internet connection far less of a chore—and more even with Apple users.\u003c/p\u003e
