I spent last week in Florida working remotely from our house, the one we bought years ago and rent to snowbirds each winter. It was good to be back and spend a few days at the beach. I also took a trip to Greece for 10 days in the early part of May, that was amazing! I’ll post pictures soon. Did you catch the photos I shared of my spring trip to Switzerland last year? Woah the flowers and scenery! I’m home in California for most of the summer and looking forward to doing some local adventures here in Northern California. Years ago I posted about the best spots to visit in Sonoma County but it deserves an update! I’m thinking I’ll post a bit more this summer about some of the best things to do between San Francisco and Lake Tahoe. California is a beautiful place to visit in summer. :) Favorite links from the week: This elegant Washington D.C. townhome and garden extension. So lovely: the dark tones and wood finishes in this home. Very cool: the mid century vibes and botanicals surrounding this abode. Perfect for summer: these light and bright well decorated spaces. Why slow decorating is the key to authentic interiors. Plants that thrive in the shade. Free and fun things you can do during the summer. Guess which brand won America’s trust as most favorite for 2025? Life lessons from older adults. The lifetime effects of a fixed vs. growth mindset.",
