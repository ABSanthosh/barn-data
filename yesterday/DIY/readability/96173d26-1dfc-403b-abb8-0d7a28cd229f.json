The feature detects pulse loss, warns you, and can alert emergency services if necessary. The feature is AI-powered, analyzes heart rate data, and can be activated through the \"Personal Safety\" app. Last year, when Google announced the Pixel Watch 3, not all of its features were immediately available. The company was still waiting for the FDA approval for Loss of Pulse Detection. Last month, that was taken care of, and the feature is being enabled through an update now. Loss of Pulse Detection is a medical-grade feature, which requires an extra level of approval before it can be made available to consumers. Rather than wait for the US Food and Drug Administration to complete its review process, Google went ahead and shipped the Pixel Watch 3 with the feature disabled. Back in February, Google received FDA clearance to roll it out, which it has started to do. So, what actually is \"Loss of Pulse\" detection? This feature essentially makes the Pixel Watch 3 more reliable when it comes to monitoring your heart. Instead of those frustrating gaps in your heart rate data during your jog or weightlifting session, the watch should now be able to maintain a more consistent reading. This is pretty crucial if you're serious about tracking your fitness, but it's even more important for emergencies. Related This Life-saving Pixel Watch 3 Health Feature Is Coming to the US Smartwatches are not just for tracking your workouts, but they can also potentially be tools to save your life. The Pixel Watch 3 was missing a key feature pending FDA approval, and now, that's finally out of the way. The Pixel Watch 3 uses concurrent passive algorithms to check your pulse once a second. If the watch doesn't detect a pulse, active sensors burst into action to check for false detections–like not wearing the watch. This is when \"Stage 1\" of the alert phase kicks in, and you'll see a notification asking if you're okay. If you don't take action on those notifications, more aggressive alerts will follow with a countdown until it calls emergency services. Google's AI-powered algorithm analyzes a combination of physiological data, including heart rate and motion data, to determine if a loss of pulse event has occurred. It's much more than the simple pulse monitoring that's been available since launch. Also, Google is upfront about the feature not being failproof. There's no guarantee if will detect every instance of pulse loss, and there could also be false positives, but you can simply tell your watch you're okay in those instances. The feature is not intended for people with known heart conditions or those requiring constant cardiac monitoring. It should also be known that emergency calling is subject to the same limitations as your phone. You need to have a solid signal and enough battery. Of course, a Wi-Fi-only model needs to be connected to your phone to make the call. Earlier this week, the Pixel Watch 3 received a software update to squash some bugs. The Loss of Pulse detection feature is not part of that update. Instead, it's enabled via an update to the \"Personal Safety\" app that comes pre-installed on the watch. The feature can be enabled inside the app under \"Safety \u0026 Emergency.\" Source: Engadget Related Google's Pixel Watch 3 Is Bigger and Brighter Google revealed the new Pixel Watch 3 at its Made by Google event on Tuesday. The company's third generation smartwatch is heavily geared towards helping runners train more efficiently and effectively, while still offering a slew of productivity and connectivity options.",

features were immediately available. The company was still waiting for the FDA approval for Loss of Pulse Detection. Last month, that was taken care of, and the feature is being enabled through an update now.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eLoss of Pulse Detection is a medical-grade feature, which requires an extra level of approval before it can be made available to consumers. Rather than wait for the US Food and Drug Administration to complete its review process, Google went ahead and shipped the Pixel Watch 3 with the feature disabled. Back in February, Google received FDA clearance to roll it out, which it has started to do.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSo, what actually is \u0026#34;Loss of Pulse\u0026#34; detection? This feature essentially makes the Pixel Watch 3 more reliable when it comes to monitoring your heart. Instead of those frustrating gaps in your heart rate data during your jog or weightlifting session, the watch should now be able to maintain a more consistent reading. This is pretty crucial if you\u0026#39;re serious about tracking your fitness, but it\u0026#39;s even more important for emergencies.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n

but they can also potentially be tools to save your life. The Pixel Watch 3 was missing a key feature pending FDA approval, and now, that\u0026#39;s finally out of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\n\n                    \n\n\n                \n                \n                \n                \n\n                \n                \n                \n                \t\n\n\n                \n\n                \n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\n                \n        \n        \n        \n            \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pixel Watch 3 uses concurrent passive algorithms to check your pulse once a second. If the watch doesn\u0026#39;t detect a pulse, active sensors burst into action to check for false detections–like not wearing the watch. This is when \u0026#34;Stage 1\u0026#34; of the alert phase kicks in, and you\u0026#39;ll see a notification asking if you\u0026#39;re okay. If you don\u0026#39;t take action on those notifications, more aggressive alerts will follow with a countdown until it calls emergency services.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eGoogle\u0026#39;s AI-powered algorithm analyzes a combination of physiological data, including heart rate and motion data, to determine if a loss of pulse event has occurred. It\u0026#39;s much more than the simple pulse monitoring that\u0026#39;s been available since launch. Also, Google is upfront about the feature not being failproof. There\u0026#39;s no guarantee if will detect every instance of pulse loss, and there could also be false positives, but you can simply tell your watch you\u0026#39;re okay in those instances.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe feature is not intended for people with known heart conditions or those requiring constant cardiac monitoring. It should also be known that emergency calling is subject to the same limitations as your phone. You need to have a solid signal and enough battery. Of course, a Wi-Fi-only model needs to be connected to your phone to make the call.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eEarlier this week, the Pixel Watch 3 received a software update to squash some bugs. The Loss of Pulse detection feature is not part of that update. Instead, it\u0026#39;s enabled via an update to the \u0026#34;Personal Safety\u0026#34; app that comes pre-installed on the watch. The feature can be enabled inside the app under \u0026#34;Safety \u0026amp; Emergency.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca
