  "text": "Sign in to your How-To Geek account TerraMaster has officially released the D1 SSD Plus, a brand-new USB4 SSD enclosure that's designed to give anyone working on the go some serious speed and versatility. It turns any NVMe SSD into a high-speed external drive for your laptop, tablet, desktop PC, and other USB-compatible devices. At its core, the D1 SSD Plus has a USB4 40Gb/s interface. When you pair it with a high-performance NVMe SSD, like a Samsung 990 PRO or a WD Black SN850X, you're looking at read speeds of up to a blistering 3853MB/s and write speeds of up to 3707MB/s. To put that into perspective, you can transfer a 3GB video in roughly a single second. That means you can absolutely fly through 4K/8K video editing, move huge files around, and run applications without a hitch. What's really cool is how the D1 SSD Plus handles cooling. TerraMaster built the D1 SSD Plus with an aerospace-grade aluminum alloy enclosure that comes with large, dual-sided cooling fins. TerraMaster claims this thermal design means it can keep your SSD at optimal temperatures without needing a fan. This should also mean there is no performance throttling, even during intensive tasks like video rendering or database processing. The D1 SSD Plus also runs completely silently with 0dB(A) operation. This is a massive win for anyone working in a recording studio or a quiet office environment, or even at home while others are sleeping. For some user-friendly touches, there's a micro-perforated LED indicator that makes it easier to use in low-light conditions. Swapping out an SSD is a breeze, taking just two minutes. To prevent accidental drops, it has anti-slip silicone footpads, so it has to be a pretty serious hit to fall over. D1 SSD Plus The TerraMaster D1 SSD Plus is a high-performance USB4 SSD enclosure. It has a 40Gbps interface, delivering speeds of up to 3853MB/s read and 3707MB/s write, making it ideal for 4K/8K video editing and large data transfers. Compatibility is key for a device like this, and the D1 SSD Plus plays nice with a lot of devices. It supports 2280 M.2 NVMe SSDs and plays nice with USB4, Thunderbolt 3/4/5, and USB-C interfaces. That means it'll work seamlessly across macOS, Windows, and Linux platforms. You can pop in anything from a budget SSD to an 8TB high-capacity drive, and it's ready for even larger drives in the future. This SSD comes with the TDAS Mobile app, which works on iOS and Android for easy backups of your photos, videos, and other data. If you're on Windows 8, 10, or 11, the free TPC Backupper software supports scheduled, incremental, and differential backups. You can also just use your own backup solutions, and Mac computers can use Apple's own Time Machine. You can get the TerraMaster D1 SSD Plus right now from the official TerraMaster website or Amazon for $110. It comes with a 2-year global warranty and lifetime technical support, so if you're looking for some serious high-performance USB4 portable storage, this is definitely one to check out.

             \u003cdiv id=\"article-body\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eTerraMaster has officially released the D1 SSD Plus, a brand-new USB4 SSD enclosure that\u0026#39;s designed to give anyone working on the go some serious speed and versatility. It turns any NVMe SSD into a high-speed external drive for your laptop, tablet, desktop PC, and other USB-compatible devices.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eAt its core, the D1 SSD Plus has a USB4 40Gb/s interface. When you pair it with a high-performance NVMe SSD, like a Samsung 990 PRO or a WD Black SN850X, you\u0026#39;re looking at read speeds of up to a blistering 3853MB/s and write speeds of up to 3707MB/s. To put that into perspective, you can transfer a 3GB video in roughly a single second. That means you can absolutely fly through 4K/8K video editing, move huge files around, and run applications without a hitch.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026#39;s really cool is how the D1 SSD Plus handles cooling. TerraMaster built the D1 SSD Plus with an aerospace-grade aluminum alloy enclosure that comes with large, dual-sided cooling fins. TerraMaster claims this thermal design means it can keep your SSD at optimal temperatures without needing a fan. This should also mean there is no performance throttling, even during intensive tasks like video rendering or database processing.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n    \n\u003cp\u003eThe D1 SSD Plus also runs completely silently with 0dB(A) operation. This is a massive win for anyone working in a recording studio or a quiet office environment, or even at home while others are sleeping.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eFor some user-friendly touches, there\u0026#39;s a micro-perforated LED indicator that makes it easier to use in low-light conditions. Swapping out an SSD is a breeze, taking just two minutes. To prevent accidental drops, it has anti-slip silicone footpads, so it has to be a pretty serious hit to fall over.\u003c/p\u003e        \n    \n                \n                                \n
