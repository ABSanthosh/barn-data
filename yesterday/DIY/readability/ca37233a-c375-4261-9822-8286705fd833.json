  "text": "Kickstarter Sign in to your MUO account Kickstarter is rolling out a host of new tools for both creators and backers. The best new tool for backers is a feature called Pledge Over Time, which enables backers to split their pledge into four equal payments. But there are plenty of other new tools also worth mentioning. While Kickstarter is already a hugely popular crowdfunding site connecting creators with people keen to back them, it's still keen to improve the experience for both sides of that equation. And in order to do that, Kickstarter has announced a slew of new tools for both creators (those people seeking to fund their creations) and backers (those people happy to fund those creations). Related The 7 Best Crowdfunding Websites to Fund Your Startup Are you a startup founder looking to raise funds? Here are some of the best crowdfunding websites to help you get started. There are too many new tools to cover them all here, so if you're a regular Kickstarter user, you should read the full announcement post to make sure you're aware of everything coming down the pike. However, we are going to highlight a few of the biggest tools. First, there's Pledge Over Time, which allows backers to split their pledge into four equal payments two weeks apart. This feature is already live, with a handful of projects currently supporting it. Next up is Kickstarter's promise to notify backers when a project fails. If a creator breaks the rules or struggles to fulfill pledges, Kickstarter will notify backers of the issue and the actions the company is taking. Last but not least are new Pledge Management tools for creators. These will make it much easier for creators to manage campaigns, from surveys to shipping, and even tax collection. These new tools are part of Kickstarter's 2025 Product Roadmap. Some of these tools are available starting today, while others will be rolled out throughout the year. However, all of them are designed to improve the Kickstarter experience for all concerned. Always Think Carefully Before Backing a Kickstarter Project As nice as these new tools are, and as exciting as Kickstarter can be (for both parties), it's important to always think carefully before backing a Kickstarter project. Do you trust the creator to deliver on the promises they're making? And can you afford to back said project without adversely affecting your income? Plenty of Kickstarter projects have failed in the past, with products never being delivered, or failing to live up to the hype. But the majority of backers do get the reward they expected, delivered on time. So it's all about choosing wisely rather than avoiding the lure of crowdfunding entirely.",

However, we are going to highlight a few of the biggest tools.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFirst, there\u0026#39;s Pledge Over Time, which allows backers to split their pledge into four equal payments two weeks apart. This feature is already live, with a handful of projects currently supporting it.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eNext up is Kickstarter\u0026#39;s promise to notify backers when a project fails. If a creator breaks the rules or struggles to fulfill pledges, Kickstarter will notify backers of the issue and the actions the company is taking.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eLast but not least are new Pledge Management tools for creators. These will make it much easier for creators to manage campaigns, from surveys to shipping, and even tax collection.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eThese new tools are part of Kickstarter\u0026#39;s 2025 Product Roadmap. Some of these tools are available starting today, while others will be rolled out throughout the year. However, all of them are designed to improve the Kickstarter experience for all concerned.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"always-think-carefully-before-backing-a-kickstarter-project\"\u003e\n                        Always Think Carefully Before Backing a Kickstarter Project\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs nice as these new tools are, and as exciting as Kickstarter can be (for both parties), it\u0026#39;s important to always think carefully before backing a Kickstarter project. Do you trust the creator to deliver on the promises they\u0026#39;re making? And can you afford to back said project without adversely affecting your income?\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003ePlenty of Kickstarter projects have failed in the past, with products never being delivered, or failing to live up to the hype. But the majority of backers do get the reward they expected, delivered on time. So it\u0026#39;s all about choosing wisely rather than avoiding the lure of crowdfunding entirely.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
