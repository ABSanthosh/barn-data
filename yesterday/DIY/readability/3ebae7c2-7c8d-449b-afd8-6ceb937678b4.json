But there is one smart TV platform that's better than any other: Google's Android TV. 1 Extensive App Ecosystem Android TV enjoys a vibrant app ecosystem thanks to Google. Google is the company behind the Android operating system, and thanks to the platform's maturity (it has been around since 2014), thousands of apps are available for download. However, it's not just the sheer number of apps distributed via Google Play. Outside Google Play, you can sideload apps on your Android TV that Google has blocked from its app store for various reasons. So, no matter which app you're looking for, it's probably available to download and install on Android TV. Android TV's best apps include everything from utility apps for sending files between devices to file managers and much more. 2 Installing Apps Is a Breeze Muhammad Alimaki/Shutterstock Besides the vibrant app ecosystem, Google has made installing apps on Android TV a cinch. You can officially install apps on your Android TV in two ways. First, you can open Google Play directly on Android TV and search for your desired app. Second, you can remotely install an app on your Android TV using Google Play on your Android phone. The latter is thanks to the ability to remotely install apps on other devices using Google Play. It provides the best and easiest way to install apps if you also have an Android device. Like Android on smartphones and tablets, Android TV is also permissive to installing apps from third-party marketplaces. If the official channels are insufficient, you can easily sideload apps on Android TV. 3 Less Bloatware Another likable aspect of Android TV is less bloat; Android TV has way fewer pre-installed apps. Although this varies depending on the TV manufacturer, there are generally fewer additional apps installed that you don't need. It has a minimal list of pre-installed apps, and most of these are actually useful. For instance, there's no denying that video streaming apps like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and YouTube are useful and quicker to access if pre-installed. 4 Google TV Interface Refined the User Experience With the release of Google TV, a new refined interface built on Android TV, the platform's experience has never been better. Google TV provides a sleek, modern interface that prioritizes personalization and makes it easy to find content. Google TV adds recommendations by showcasing content from different apps on the Home Screen. So, instead of browsing for content in individual apps, you can jump straight into the content from the Home Screen. It also provides a universal search button for finding content across different apps.

Google Assistant is baked into Android TV by default. It offers seamless voice control that integrates deeply into the platform, enhancing user convenience and accessibility. Thanks to this, you can use it for hands-free control. While the market offers a variety of smart TV operating systems, Android TV stands out among the crowd due to its vibrant app ecosystem, ease of app installation on and off the Google Play Store, less bloatware, Google TV interface, and Google Assistant integration. Remember, you don't need to buy a new TV to get Android TV. A streaming device like Google's TV Streamer 4K is all you need.",

It provides the best and easiest way to install apps if you also have an Android device.
