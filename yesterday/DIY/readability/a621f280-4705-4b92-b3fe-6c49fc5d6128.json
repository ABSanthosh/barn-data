  "text": "Cloud gaming can be great if you want to play games on less powerful hardware, but some services only give you a strict selection of titles and won't let you play with your own library. However, this may change soon for Xbox fans, as an insider has claimed that Microsoft will soon let you play your owned titles on the cloud. Microsoft May Be Working on Adding Your Library to Its Cloud Gaming Service As reported by The Verge and according to \"sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans,\" the company is planning to add your Xbox library to the cloud gaming service. By the sounds of it, the new titles won't be automatically available to play on the cloud when you subscribe to the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate plan, but they will get added after you purchase them. The source states that this feature will work hand-in-hand with the news that broke earlier today, when Microsoft stated that you can purchase Xbox games on Android starting in November 2024. The plan is that people will purchase titles on their phones, and can then immediately stream them to their devices. If the project succeeds, it would be a good way to bridge the gap between owning your games and playing titles on a cloud. If the sources are correct, you won't have to wait long to try out this new technology. Microsoft hopes to get it up and running on the Xbox Insiders branch this November, and if the testing goes well, the company will focus on adding more titles to the service and rolling it out to every Xbox gamer. In the meantime, check out our guide on what Xbox Cloud Gaming is so you can prepare for the potential upcoming release.",
