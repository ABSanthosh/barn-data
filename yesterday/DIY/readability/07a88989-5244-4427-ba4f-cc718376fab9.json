If you can, test this out before committing to a contract. Check the 5G coverage in your area, as it can vary and might not be as comprehensive outside major cities. Experiment with router placement for optimal signal, and expect variable speeds. 5G Wi-Fi is a fantastic home networking option that lets you use the internet without a landline phone or other wired connections. However, you'll need to take a few steps to make sure your home is ready for a 5G Wi-Fi connection. 5G Wi-Fi refers to a router that uses an incoming 5G cellular connection and broadcasts a 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi signal. Your devices don't need to be 5G-ready to use a 5G Wi-Fi router. Check 5G Coverage in Your Area Despite the rapid deployment of 5G around the US, coverage isn’t as comprehensive as it could be. Most major cities now boast very good 5G coverage, but this can change as soon as you go somewhere even a little bit rural. You probably already have an idea of what 5G is like in your area based on the signal you get on your smartphone, but most different carriers offer maps showing their 5G coverage. You could also use a tool like nPerf’s 5G coverage checker to compare some different carriers. Consider Where to Place Your 5G Router The position of your 5G router can have a massive impact on the signal you receive. However, unlike with a traditional broadband router, you're not limited by the location of your main phone socket. Don’t be afraid to experiment with a few spots, as some areas of your home may receive better coverage. Conventional wisdom suggests placing your 5G router off the floor and away from obstacles like walls, doors, or ceilings. A central location in your home away from the kitchen—all the appliances there can disrupt your Wi-Fi signal—is usually your best bet. Know That 5G Speeds Are Seriously Variable Tapati Rinchumrus/Shutterstock One of the advantages of home broadband compared with, say, a cellphone signal is that it’s pretty consistent. While you might see some variation depending on the number of devices connected, most people won’t see serious fluctuations in the speeds they get with home Wi-Fi. 5G connections can be much more temperamental, affected by everything from network congestion caused by heavy usage in your area to poor weather conditions. As more people use 5G on cell phones and at home, networks will need continuous improvement. If 5G Wi-Fi isn't currently available in your area or isn't performing well for you right now, that could change in the near future. Why You Might End Up Wishing for 4G Your 5G router will prioritize this over a 4G signal. Unfortunately, it might force you onto a weaker, slower 5G connection even when a stronger 4G signal is available. The extent to which you can configure connections varies from device to device. Be sure to read the fine print and check out other options on the market, like Wi-Fi access points and routers, to see how customizable they are before you make any decisions. If you cannot get a traditional broadband connection, whether due to installation restrictions or limitations of existing fiber networks, 5G home Wi-Fi can be a lifesaver. It’s also a great option if you want to improve the flexibility of your connection. Let’s say, for example, that you’re on the road or moving to a new home or apartment. With 5G Wi-Fi, you can unplug your router, take it with you, and get online as soon as you plug it in at your new place. You can’t do that with traditional broadband. Carriers throughout the US are already promoting 5G Wi-Fi as the future of getting online at home, and it’s easy to envision a future in which this could become the status quo. Just consider all the information above to ensure you don’t regret making the switch.",
