It might be in a box, cluttering a drawer, or lost at the back of a wardrobe. Whatever the case, your old WI-Fi router or combined modem/router can be reused. So, if you have one kicking around the place, here are several uses for an old router. Build a Wireless Repeater What if your Wi-Fi network doesn't extend across the full range of your home? Although you can opt for powerline Ethernet adapters, adding a second router into the mix is a good alternative. This means connecting the old router to your new wireless network using the Wi-Fi signal. It shares access to the Wi-Fi network, giving greater coverage. Although there may be some latency issues, this is a quick and easy way to extend your wireless network. It has various uses, from boosting your Wi-Fi signal around your home to letting you stream video to your tablet while chilling in the garden. However, Wi-Fi repeaters aren't the only option: other Wi-Fi fixes may be better than using a repeater. Create a Guest Wi-Fi Network If you have people regularly dropping in and using your Wi-Fi, why not give them their own network? This project is like the wireless repeater but with a twist. The router connects to your existing, password-protected network but gives password-free access to new devices. This will use the guest network feature of your old router. By default, this prevents guests from accessing other devices on your network. If this level of security isn't enough, check the firewall settings on the main router to adjust. Stream Internet Radio You can use that old router to stream your favorite radio stations online. Some routers can be configured to play internet radio—if you're prepared to install alternative firmware for your router. You'll also need some other software, as well as a USB sound card to output audio. While not an easy build and plenty of other internet radio options are available, this project is still great. It gives you an insight into installing custom firmware, as well as an appreciation of how to stream music. Use the Router as a Cheap Network Switch Most routers don't have more than six Ethernet ports. With the increase in wireless technology around the home, this figure might even be as low as four. But with a clear need for devices to be connected over Ethernet, you might run out of ports. When you're trying to decide between using Wi-Fi vs. Ethernet, it's good to make the decision based on the use case. For example, online gaming with a console or PC is more reliable using Ethernet. Your TV decoder will provide better streaming over Ethernet than wireless. If you run out of Ethernet ports, you can add more with a network switch. It's basically the networking version of a power strip; connecting an old router to your current one will instantly increase the number of ports available. To avoid conflicts, don't forget to disable wireless networking on the old router. Turn Your Old Router Into a Wireless Bridge What if your new router is wireless only? Perhaps your ISP doesn't offer a router with Ethernet ports, or maybe you use a 4G or 5G internet provider. Either way, if you need to connect Ethernet devices to your home network, a wireless bridge is the answer. It's both a fun and inexpensive project to turn an old router into a wireless bridge using free firmware. This works a little like a wireless repeater, but rather than share the Wi-Fi connection, the wireless bridge offers Ethernet. The old router connects to your existing Wi-Fi network—simply connect devices to its Ethernet ports. Convert Your Router Into a NAS Drive Looking for a way to store your data on a single device and access it from anywhere in your home? You need Network Attached Storage (NAS), which is basically a hard disk drive attached to your network. If you're trying to decide between a DIY NAS vs. Pre-Built NAS, you can save money using an old router hanging around. Note that this is limited to routers that can run custom firmware (like DD-WRT) and have a USB port. You should also be able to browse the contents of any connected USB devices via the router. (Without a USB port, there won't be an easy way to attach extra storage devices.) Once set up, your custom-built NAS should give you instant access to your files from anywhere in the house. Use an Old Router as a Web Server On top of everything else, your router can also host a basic web page. This might be a home-only website, intended to share vital information with your family. Alternatively, it might even be a blog, as custom router firmware will support a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) server. As such, you could even use your old hardware to install WordPress on Ubuntu. Run a website and need an affordable staging area for testing themes, plugins, and new code? Your old router might be the low-spec server you need. Make Your Own VPN Router Old routers supported by custom firmware can be set up with VPN software. This means that if you have a VPN account with, say, ExpressVPN (MakeUseOf readers can save 49% on our top-ranked VPN choice), it can be set up on your router. Enabling your VPN at the router level means that every device on your network is protected by the VPN. You don't need to install individual client apps on your PC or mobile devices when connecting to a VPN through your home network. Note that some old routers have VPN provision, but this only works when they're set to modem-only mode. Learn more in our guide to setting up a VPN on your router. Make Money From Your Old Router If you don't fancy wasting time trying to set up your old router with modern hardware, why not sell it? Various outlets will let you make a few dollars from old tech, most notably eBay. Simply list the device with the make and model number. Your customer will typically be anyone looking for an affordable router, but networking enthusiasts and retro-tech collectors might also be interested. Follow our tips for selling vintage items on eBay to maximize your haul. Generating cash for old equipment is a great way to raise funds for new gadgets. Set Up a Separate Network for IoT and Smart Home Devices As mentioned earlier, most current routers will let you set up a secondary network. It’s also a good idea if you use smart home tech and Internet of Things gadgets, especially if you're worried that your smart thermostat is a cybersecurity risk. If your current router doesn’t support an extra wireless network, set up your old router as a network specifically for smart home and IoT devices. As with creating a wireless bridge, the router can be linked to your main network, and you then simply connect your IoT devices to it. In the event of problems, you can easily pull the plug, while the firewall on the router can be used to configure connections. Learn More About Home Networking Routers are pretty much plug-and-play. They configure new connections automatically, allowing you to get online quickly and easily. If you wanted to learn more about your home network, you would look at the admin screen. But if you click the wrong option, everything could go wrong. The solution? Use an old router to learn more about home networking. Firewalls, DMZs, MAC filters, and more can all be learned with hands-on experience that doesn't knock your entire network offline. Using a network hosted on an old router, you don't have to rely on a factory reset if things go wrong. Configure Your Router as a Public Hotspot Rather than use an old router as a standard guest Wi-Fi access point for people visiting your house, you could be more enterprising. Dedicated software can be installed on an OpenWrt or DD-WRT router (other firmware is also supported) that enables you to create a Wi-Fi hotspot for your business. This can offer free or paid internet access, along with branded interfaces and even adverts, and is welcomed by visitors who want Wi-Fi without an internet service provider. Naturally, steps must be taken to comply with CCPA, GDPR, and similar privacy legislation. However, if your old router is compatible with firmware such as HotspotSystem, consider this option for your business or side hustle. Hack Your Router into a Smart Home Automation Hub With the right router, you could extend the possibilities beyond an IoT or smart home network. Forget a network—build your own automation hub! Several automation tools are available for OpenWrt and DD-WRT routers. For example, a tool called Crelay can be installed on OpenWrt. This lets you control USB relay cards and remotely activate or control connected devices. Crelay is one of several automation tools you can install on and control from your router. Again, this is a use for an old router compatible with OpenWrt or DD-WRT. If your router isn't supported, you’ll have to rule out this upgrade. Donate Your Old Router Finally, why not simply donate your old router to a good cause? Schools, kindergartens, churches, charities, and more could use it. Any organization that relies on goodwill can use your old router to extend their network, stream internet radio, set up a guest Wi-Fi network, or any of the other uses listed here. You might not make any money from it, but you'll know it's being used for a good cause. It doesn’t matter if you have a standard router or one with a modem built in. If you’re looking for ideas on what to do with an old broadband router or a standalone router, these are all great ways to repurpose it.",

\n\u003cp\u003eVarious outlets will let you make a few dollars from old tech, most notably eBay. Simply list the device with the make and model number. Your customer will typically be anyone looking for an affordable router, but networking enthusiasts and retro-tech collectors might also be interested.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFollow our \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/ebay-vintage-selling-tips/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etips for selling vintage items on e\u003c/a\u003eBay to maximize your haul. Generating cash for old equipment is a great way to raise funds for new gadgets.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"set-up-a-separate-network-for-iot-and-smart-home-devices\"\u003e\n                        Set Up a Separate Network for IoT and Smart Home Devices\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned earlier, most current routers will let you set up a secondary network. It’s also a good idea if you use smart home tech and Internet of Things gadgets, especially if you\u0026#39;re worried that \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/is-your-smart-thermostat-cybersecurity-risk/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyour smart thermostat is a cybersecurity risk\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf your current router doesn’t support an extra wireless network, set up your old router as a network specifically for smart home and IoT devices.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAs with creating a wireless bridge, the router can be linked to your main network, and you then simply connect your IoT devices to it. In the event of problems, you can easily pull the plug, while the firewall on the router can be used to configure connections.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"learn-more-about-home-networking\"\u003e\n                        Learn More About Home Networking\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRouters are pretty much plug-and-play. They configure new connections automatically, allowing you to get online quickly and easily.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf you wanted to learn more about your home network, you would look at the admin screen. But if you click the wrong option, everything could go wrong. The solution? Use an old router to learn more about home networking. Firewalls, DMZs, MAC filters, and more can all be learned with hands-on experience that doesn\u0026#39;t knock your entire network offline.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eUsing a network hosted on an old router, you don\u0026#39;t have to rely on a factory reset if things go wrong.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"configure-your-router-as-a-public-hotspot\"\u003e\n                        Configure Your Router as a Public Hotspot\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eRather than use an old router as a standard guest Wi-Fi access point for people visiting your house, you could be more enterprising.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eDedicated software can be installed on an OpenWrt or DD-WRT router (other firmware is also supported) that enables you to create a Wi-Fi hotspot for your business. This can offer free or paid internet access, along with branded interfaces and even adverts, and is welcomed by visitors who want \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-get-wifi-without-internet/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWi-Fi without an internet service provider\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, steps must be taken to comply with CCPA, GDPR, and similar privacy legislation. However, if your old router is compatible with firmware such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.hotspotsystem.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHotspotSystem\u003c/a\u003e, consider this option for your business or side hustle.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"hack-your-router-into-a-smart-home-automation-hub\"\u003e\n                        Hack Your Router into a Smart Home Automation Hub\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the right router, you could extend the possibilities beyond an IoT or smart home network. Forget a network—build your own automation hub!\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSeveral automation tools are available for OpenWrt and DD-WRT routers. For example, a tool called Crelay can be installed on OpenWrt. This lets you control USB relay cards and remotely activate or control connected devices. Crelay is one of several automation tools you can install on and control from your router.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAgain, this is a use for an old router compatible with \u003ca href=\"https://openwrt.org/supported_devices\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOpenWrt\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/supported_devices\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDD-WRT\u003c/a\u003e. If your router isn\u0026#39;t supported, you’ll have to rule out this upgrade.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"donate-your-old-router\"\u003e\n                        Donate Your Old Router\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, why not simply donate your old router to a good cause? Schools, kindergartens, churches, charities, and more could use it.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAny organization that relies on goodwill can use your old router to extend their network, stream internet radio, set up a guest Wi-Fi network, or any of the other uses listed here. You might not make any money from it, but you\u0026#39;ll know it\u0026#39;s being used for a good cause.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t matter if you have a standard router or one with a modem built in. If you’re looking for ideas on what to do with an old broadband router or a standalone router, these are all great ways to repurpose it.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
