All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 afterFor Noelia MaGowan, her husband, and her toddler, a $100,000 kitchen renovation was worth it. The MaGowan’s house was built in 1977, and they began to have issues with their oven and sink not working. “I cook a lot and had issues with prep space and cooking multiple things at once,” Noelia adds. She and her husband hired a designer to make things more functional for them.Layout changes allow for more prep space. The major changes in the kitchen are the new appliances, new range hood, the switch from a gas oven to induction (which was “pricey but one of the best things of the new kitchen,” Noelia says), and the relocation of the fridge to the left side of the room, which made room for more counters and cabinets where it once was. There’s a half-bath off the left of the kitchen, and the MaGowan’s designer, Carrie Brandstrom (@brandstrominteriors), and her team came up with the idea to add a pocket door there to save space and make room for the fridge. Noelia says framing out the area for the refrigerator was easier than expected — plus it provided two more cabinets overhead.“There was a demo of the entire space and then breaking down the new space for the refrigerator and running the water lines,” Noelia explains. “They also had to move some heating elements and work on wiring for the new lights.”The new kitchen has more storage and looks less cluttered. In addition, the designer replaced the cabinets with new ones that extend all the way to the ceiling for more storage — the other big splurge in the space — and she replaced the old island with one that has drawers. Added storage allows the family to keep their countertops more clear, which makes the whole room look simpler and airier.The kitchen feels bigger now.And speaking of airier, the elongating pendant lights, bright white backsplash, white paints (Sherwin-Williams’ Drift of Mist and Pure White), and added open shelving make the whole room feel bigger, Noelia says. “This is my dream kitchen,” she adds. “This is our family space, and it’s beautiful, spacious, and made with such craftsmanship.”",
