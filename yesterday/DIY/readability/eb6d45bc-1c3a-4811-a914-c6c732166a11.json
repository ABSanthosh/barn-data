However, the pandemic wasn’t the only driving factor for his new approach. “Then, they (IKEA) reformulated the PAX, and while it still has its place, I couldn’t modify it like I could with the old frames,” he said. “I also personally feel like new PAX is a slight step down structurally, compared to SEKTION.” Matthew previously shared his IKEA SEKTION hack for a reach-in closet with us. Now, he has truly elevated his craft by creating an entire walk-in wardrobe using kitchen cabinets. The IKEA SEKTION Closet Hack Photo Credit: Matthew Jenkins Matthew basically took a kitchen’s worth of cabinets and transformed them into a killer wardrobe. The best part? He could modify, and adjust everything to fit exactly what he needed. (Get the shopping list here)The project wasn’t without its complexities. The client had chosen high baseboards that were 6.5 inches tall, and the ceiling was just under 96. And the frames were 90″ tall.” So Matthew got creative. Photo Credit: Matthew Jenkins The strategy changed to insetting the frames on the left into the baseboard, instead of the original plan of floating the cabinets above the baseboard. Admittedly that was the hardest part of the hack. “It involved hanging the frame panel on wall leveling and marking with a pencil, scribing and cutting baseboard with multi-use tool.” Creating Angled Shoe Shelves with UTRUSTA Shelves Photo Credit: Matthew Jenkins One of the hack’s most creative features? Custom shoe shelves. By offsetting shelf pins and modifying standard UTRUSTA shelves, Matthew created angled display spaces that maximize both storage and aesthetics. He explains how: 1. Prepare the UTRUSTA Shelves: Start with standard UTRUSTA shelves. 2. Offset the Shelf Pins: Place the front pin in the 8th hole from the bottom. Place the back pin in the 10th hole from the bottom. 3. Mark the New Pin Position: Insert the shelf into the back pin recess. Use a pencil to mark the position where the front pin will go. 4. Create a New Recess: Use a multi-use tool or a chisel to carve out a new recess for the front pin at the marked position. 5. Add the Shoe Rail: Cut deco strips to the width of the shelf to serve as a shoe rail. Leave a 3/4 inch gap from the front edge of the shelf when attaching the deco strips. By following these steps, you’ll create angled shoe shelves that are both functional and stylish. Clothes Rails For Kitchen Cabinets Photo Credit: Matthew Jenkins The other modification he had to make was to shorten the KOMPLEMENT clothes rail to fit the cabinets. “I had to cut them 2 1/8 inches smaller than the width of the cabinet, (30″ cabinet and rail length at 27 7/8″ wide)” he said, using an angle grinder for the task, although he recommends a band saw for a quicker job. What To Pay Special Attention To When working on this project, it’s crucial to pay special attention to cutting the spans of the suspension rail. Make sure there is no overhang beyond the frames and that each span hits 2 to 3 studs. This ensures that the floating SEKTION pantry cabinets are securely and adequately mounted.Check out his video tour below to see how the space turned out. It’s fantastic, offering an abundance of storage. I love the glass cabinets. You’d never guess that these were originally kitchen cabinets. Sometimes the best home solutions come from thinking outside the box – or in this case, outside the kitchen.Want a closet just like this one?
