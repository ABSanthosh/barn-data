However, that doesn’t mean bread bins are out of style, as this cool hack from @easyalex proves. Don’t get me wrong, a bread box actually helps keep bread fresh, but I personally don’t want to sacrifice the counter space. I’d much rather find other uses for these MAGASIN bread bins, and it appears I’m not alone. After checking out this hack, I did a quick peek at other bread-box DIYs, and let’s just say, they keep on coming. If you’re looking for a way to create a space-saving TV stand or entry table, then here’s the idea for you. What You’ll Need 2 IKEA MAGASIN bread boxes Beech wood Wood glue Pencil Jigsaw Circular Saw Drill Clamps Hairpin legs and screws Masking Tape Black paint DIY a Brilliant IKEA Bread Bin Table 1. Cut the Base, Sides, and Top Use a bread bin (standing on its side) to mark the curved shape for the ends of your bottom and top pieces. Make the pieces as long as you want, as long as they’re both the same. Then, cut two smaller pieces for the interior side walls (use the bottom of a bread bin to measure this). Cut a third piece of wood for the middle shelf. 2. Assemble the Pieces Screw the side walls onto the lower panel through the bottom so you don’t have screw holes. Attach the middle shelf to the side walls, then screw the bread boxes into position on each side, putting the screws on the inside of the bread bin. 3. Attach the Top Use the wood glue to attach the top panel and clamp it in place. (The hacker doesn’t use clamps, but I find it helps make the bond stronger.) Add screws from below, then remove the clamps once it’s secure. 4. Add the Legs and Finishing Touches Screw the hairpin legs onto the bottom of the unit. Tape around the handles on the MAGASIN bread bins and paint them black to match the legs. Find Your Best IKEA Bread Box Hack These IKEA bread bins turn up in plenty of hacks. You can put two bread boxes side-by-side to create a smaller table or nightstand. Or put one on top of the other to create a slim bathroom cabinet. However, with 202,500 likes, this MAGASIN bread box console from Alexander Johnson certainly stands out. Need More Storage? Some commenters felt this piece is a bit too small to provide enough storage, but I say, it all depends on what you need. IKEA has the measurements for one bread bin as 15.75 inches long, 10.25 inches deep, and 6.75 inches tall. That might be just right for a loaf or two of bread, but what about to hide your clutter? Well, when you flip it on its side for this hack, it gives you a cabinet that’s 6.75 inches wide, 20.25 inches deep, and 15.75 inches tall times two. Since Alex decided to make the piece larger than the typical double-cabinet hack, you also get the shelf in the middle. This extra shelf is perfect for displaying accessories or for extra storage. If you want to keep things hidden, use baskets or bins. You could also add an interior shelf in the bread boxes using small L-brackets. Overall, this hack gives you storage in a slim, space-saving design that looks stylish and modern. Play Around With Different Variations Adjust the overall length of your TV stand by cutting the boards longer. Check out different sizes of hairpin legs or consider other leg styles, like X or post designs. Paint the entire unit or stain it. The aesthetic possibilities are endless.
