While it's not as feature-packed as the previous updates for iOS 18.2 and iOS 18.1 were, there are still a few important changes you'll want to know about.Aside from the return of a critical Calculator feature, most of the changes in iOS 18.3 apply to iPhone models that support Apple Intelligence. Those would be the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and all iPhone 16 models. The new emoji from Unicode 16 are also missing from this update but are expected to arrive with iOS 18.4.Note: Many of these features and changes also apply to iPads running iPadOS 18.3 and Macs running macOS Sequoia 15.3.New Unity Rhythm WallpapersIncluded in the update are new wallpapers for Apple's Black Unity Collection.Apple today [Jan. 27] unveiled a new Black Unity Collection to honor Black History Month, and celebrate Black culture and community. Inspired by the rhythm of humanity, the collection includes a special-edition Apple Watch Black Unity Sport Loop, a matching watch face, and iPhone and iPad wallpapers.The wallpapers, called Unity Rhythm, feature custom lettering in black, green, and red — the colors of the Pan-African flag. They spell out \"Unity,\" which changes orientation when locked or unlocked. When you wake up your iPhone, the letters on your Lock Screen adjust, and the brushstrokes come to life.There are six to choose from: Unity, Black, Cream, Red, Green, and Gold.Apple Intelligence Enabled by DefaultAccording to Apple's release notes for developers, you'll automatically be opted into Apple Intelligence after upgrading a supported device to iOS 18.3. That way, you have immediate access to all of Apple Intelligence's features. If you don't like Apple's generative artificial intelligence tools, you can opt out via Settings » Apple Intelligence \u0026 Siri.Add Events with Visual IntelligenceVisual Intelligence was introduced with iOS 18.2 for iPhone models with Camera Control, but one thing that didn't make the cut was the ability to add events to Calendar after scanning event details from a poster, flyer, or other sources. That ability is now available with iOS 18.3. To be fair, you could add an event to Calendar manually whenever a date or time appeared in the Visual Intelligence capture, but the process is now streamlined with a Create Event action item.Identify Plants and Animals with Visual IntelligenceAnother missing thing from Visual Intelligence was the ability to identify plants and animals, which is also now included in iOS 18.3's update.Updated Style for Notification SummariesNotification Summaries, another big part of Apple Intelligence, are more visually different on the Lock Screen and in the Notification Center on an iPhone 16 model, iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max. Before, the summary glyph would help you tell them apart from regular notifications. That's still the case, but now summaries are also italicized.Manage Notification Summaries from the Lock ScreenNotification Summaries can also now be turned off per app from the Lock Screen or Notification Center. On an iPhone 16 model, iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max, swipe left on the notification summary, select Options, then choose Turn Off [App] Summaries. You may also see options to turn summaries on when they are off for an app.Notification Summaries OnboardingWhen you first enable Notification Summaries via Settings » Notifications » Summarize Notifications, iOS 18.3 clarifies that it's still a beta feature. You'll see a new onboarding screen, explaining:You can use Apple Intelligence to summarize content in notifications you receive, making them easier to scan at a glance.This beta feature will occasionally make mistakes that could misrepresent the meaning of the original notification.After continuing with Choose Notifications to Summarize, you'll turn on summaries for News \u0026 Entertainment, Communication \u0026 Social, and/or All Other Apps.Unavailable Alerts for Notification SummariesNotification Summaries rolled out with iOS 18.1, and aside from the benefits shown above, iOS 18.3 has actually taken away summaries for news and entertainment apps. This is the result of inaccurate summaries, which BBC News brought to Apple's attention.However, iOS 18.3 does include a new way to help you identify which apps can use summaries and which cannot.Go to Settings » Notifications » Summarize Notifications (you'll also see it with the onboarding process outlined above) or Settings » Apps » [App Name] » Summarize Notifications. You'll see a \"Temporarily Unavailable\" notice if it's not working. If toggled on, summaries will appear again when the feature becomes available.Equals Sign (=) Repeats Last Operation in CalculatorWhen iOS 18 first came out, the new Calculator design, as impressive as it was, left out a feature we had before: being able to hit the equals sign (=) to perform the last mathematical operation again. Now, that ability is finally back with iOS 18.3.Crop Warning for PDF ScreenshotsWhenever you crop a full-page screenshot of a PDF, such as a full-page screenshot from a website in Safari, the screenshot service will warn you that the cropped area may be accessible in some apps. Here's the full warning:The cropped content is not removed from the PDF.Content outside the cropped area won't be visible in most PDF viewers, but it can be made visible in some apps.AE/AF Lock Change for Camera ControlOn iPhone 16 models, visit Settings » Camera » Camera Control, and you'll see that the AE/AF Lock introduced in iOS 18.2 is now called Lock Focus and Exposure, making it much clearer. It also includes a description for it:Lightly press and hold, then continue touching Camera Control to maintain focus and exposure.New Genmoji Button in MessagesOn devices that support Apple Intelligence, to make creating Genmoji easier, you'll now find a Genmoji option behind the Apps (+) button.Block Button on Live VoicemailWhen you receive a Live Voicemail from an unknown number, you'll be able to block it more quickly thanks to a dedicated \"Block\" button in the corner of the Live Voicemail interface.Robot Vacuum SupportApple announced when iOS 18 first came out that Home would support robot vacuums. Well, that finally materialized with iOS 18.3. As long as the robot vac supports HomeKit or Matter, like iRobot's Roomba Combo 10 Max Robot, it should work with Home. And controlling your robot vac with Siri only works in U.S. English right now.Starlink Satellite Messaging with T-MobileApple's Emergency SOS via Satellite has been available for over two years now, giving us another way to reach emergency services when in peril. Then, iOS 18 gave us Messages via Satellite, which lets you text family and friends via a satellite connection when you do not have a Wi-Fi or cellular signal. Apple partnered with Globalstar for these features, but iOS 18.3 makes way for Starlink, SpaceX and T-Mobile's direct-to-cell satellite service, according to Bloomberg. This feature is currently available to T-Mobile users who sign up for the beta. Once you're running iOS 18.3, you should see a toggle in your cellular data settings to activate it.Bug FixesAs with any iOS software update, Apple has included a few bug fixes, all listed below.Fixes an issue where the keyboard might disappear when initiating a typed Siri request.Resolves an issue where audio playback continues until the song ends, even after closing Apple Music.There are also various WebKit bug fixes for Safari.Security UpdatesAs with bug fixes, patches for recently discovered security vulnerabilities are also included.
