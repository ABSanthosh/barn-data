Thankfully, I’ve been adventurous enough to find some IKEA hidden gems that are absolutely worth every penny. These aren’t just affordable pieces; they’re durable, functional, and stylish additions to any home that will stand the test of time. IKEA has long been known for its low-price, assemble-it-yourself furniture, but not all IKEA products are created equal. Through years of personal experience and conversations with interior designers, I’ve identified items that offer excellent value for money. These pieces combine IKEA’s signature affordability with surprising durability and versatility. So, here are 12 best IKEA products that are worth buying. They’ll not only survive your next move but will likely become longtime fixtures in your home. 12 IKEA Products Worth The Investment 1. UPPLAND Sectional Sofa UPPLAND Sofa | Photo Credit: IKEA.com The UPPLAND Sofa is a classic with its timeless design, comfortable seating, and durable fabric making it a staple in many homes. The best part? The removable and washable covers make it easy to keep clean, ensuring it looks fresh for years – they also come in various colors and patterns, allowing you to switch up your style without buying a new sofa. You can read our reviews on IKEA sofas and whether they are worth the price. 2. KALLAX Shelving Unit KALLAX shelving unit | Photo Credit: IKEA.com Versatile and stylish, the KALLAX shelving unit is something I swear by always. Whether you need extra storage in your living room, bedroom, or office, this unit has you covered. Its customizable nature means you can add drawers, doors, and baskets to fit your needs – use it as a room divider, TV stand, or even a bench with added cushions.Besides that, the KALLAX is the darling of the IKEA hacking community. There are just so many ways to hack a KALLAX, even if it’s as simple as sealing the back of the KALLAX. It’s also heartening to see IKEA adding new items to the KALLAX range like a desk, underframe legs, and asymmetrical cubes, making the KALLAX better than ever. 3. POÄNG Armchair POÄNG armchair | Photo Credit: IKEA.com The POÄNG Armchair offers unmatched comfort with its ergonomic design and flexible frame and is one of my personal faves. It’s perfect for relaxing after a long day, and its sleek look complements any decor style and it comes with a variety of cushion options, allowing you to match it to your home’s aesthetic. While I don’t have one in my home, my mom has two and the pair has lasted for over 10 years. They are still as springy and the cushions have held up well. From what I see, they look set to last for many more years. 4. MALM Bed Frame MALM Storage Bed | Photo Credit: IKEA.com The MALM Storage Bed Frame is a game-changer for small bedrooms with its built-in storage. The underbed storage space is accessible by simply pulling the strap and voilà! The base lifts smoothly and easily. It provides ample space for linens, clothes, or other large items and great for off-season items. See this hack if you want to add even more storage capacity under the bed. 5. RÅSKOG Utility Cart RÅSKOG utility cart | Photo Credit: IKEA.com The RÅSKOG Utility Cart is a small-space hero. Its compact size and mobility make it perfect for any room needing extra storage – the kitchen for utensils, in the bathroom for toiletries, or as a bedside table. The RÅSKOG is also great for hobbies so use it as a craft cart, sewing station, or portable gardening center.Top it with the NORRÅVA lid and you’ve created an extra worktop in the kitchen or craft room. Besides that, it’s still one of IKEA’s cutest carts. See this post for more ideas on the RÅSKOG cart. 6. BILLY Bookcase IKEA BILLY bookcase with desk | Photo Credit: IKEA.com The BILLY Bookcase is an IKEA icon. Its simple design and customizable options make it a favorite for book lovers and organizers. I can personally attest to BILLY’s longevity and versatility. I’ve owned BILLY bookcases for over two decades now, and they’ve moved with me through different homes. Despite the wear and tear of multiple relocations, they still look great and function perfectly, (except for one that fell victim to a hacking accident). Over the years, I’ve customized them to suit my changing needs – adding strip lights for ambiance and painting them to match my decor. I’ve not bought a BILLY bookcase in recent years so I’m unsure about the new BILLY. Some questions about its paper foils, printed wood effects, and plastic edges. But I’m keeping my fingers crossed the new one is as durable as earlier models. Let me know in the comments whether the new BILLY is as good as the old ones. 7. IVAR System IVAR Shelving System | Photo Credit: IKEA.com It’s no secret that I’m a big fan of the IKEA IVAR. It’s another IKEA gem that offers exceptional value for money. This versatile storage solution consists of solid pine shelving units that can be customized to fit nearly any space or need.What sets IVAR apart is its raw, unfinished look that allows for endless personalization – you can paint it, stain it, or leave it natural to suit your style. The system’s modular design means you can start small and expand as your needs grow, making it an ideal choice for everything from pantry organization to home office storage. I’ve used IVAR in my home for years, starting with a row of IKEA cabinets in my home office. Then, in my bedroom, turning the IVAR 3-drawer chests into nightstands. The latest is an IVAR bar cabinet hack. And it won’t be the last. 8. HEMNES Chest of Drawers (Solid Pine Version) HEMNES chest of 8-drawers | Photo Credit: IKEA.com If you prefer more traditional styles, you can’t go wrong with the HEMNES dresser. Crafted from solid wood, the HEMNES dressers (in 8, 6 or 3-drawer versions) offer ample storage space with deep drawers, making them perfect for bedrooms, nurseries, or even living areas. I’ve had my HEMNES dresser for over five years now, and it still looks as good as the day I bought it. If it ever gets old — though I’m not betting on it — I’ll refresh it with a HEMNES hack. The bobbin trim dresser is so good. 9. FJÄLLBO TV Unit FJÄLLBO unit | Photo Credit: IKEA.com The FJÄLLBO shelving units combine rustic charm with modern functionality; its metal frames and wooden shelves provide a sturdy base for your TV and media equipment, while its open design keeps everything easily accessible. Use it as an audio rack, bookshelf, or even an entryway table. 10. MÅLA Easel MÅLA Easel | Photo Credit: IKEA.com The MÅLA Easel is a must-have for creative households. Its height is adjustable and features a dual-sided design, making it perfect for kids and adults. As a creative, I use it for my paintings and drawings – but it can also serve as a display for notes and reminders. 11. PAX Wardrobe System PAX Wardrobe | Photo Credit: IKEA.com The PAX wardrobe system is IKEA’s answer to custom closet solutions, offering flexibility at a fraction of the cost. With a wide range of sizes, colors, and internal fittings, PAX can be tailored to fit any space and storage need. From hanging rods and shelves to drawer units and shoe racks, you can design a wardrobe that perfectly organizes your clothing and accessories. I use the PAX for clothes storage but that’s not where it impresses me. What I love is how my two PAX units store miscellaneous large items things like luggage, a foldable mattress, pillows, and large frames I’ve yet to hang (when will I ever get to that?). I keep throwing stuff in and they swallow them up.For anyone looking to maximize their storage space with a customized solution, the PAX wardrobe system is definitely worth the investment. 12. IKEA Kitchen Range Kitchen Using IKEA METOD | Photo Credit: Jules Yap I renovated my kitchen using the IKEA kitchen system some years ago. Since then, I’m a believer. The IKEA Kitchen Range, be it the SEKTION or METOD, is truly one of the best things about IKEA. The system’s flexibility means you can create anything from a compact galley kitchen to a sprawling kitchen with an island. Don’t get me started on its clever interior fittings – from pull-out pantry units to integrated recycling solutions – they can help maximize every precious square inch. The quality of the cabinets is a notch above other IKEA ranges – they’re sturdy, well-constructed, and come with a 25-year warranty. Compared to custom kitchen cabinets, they are well worth every penny.What are your favorite IKEA products that you think are worth buying? Share your thoughts in the comments below.",
