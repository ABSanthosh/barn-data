  "text": "It's fun to give yourself a cool iPhone Home Screen layout. Grouping apps into various folders on different pages is a good way to keep yourself organized, but there are even more creative ways to organize your iPhone Home Screen layout. Here are my favorite ones. Light and Dark Modes If you have iOS 18 or later, consider using Light and Dark Modes; these nicely complement some of the best hidden iOS 18 features. Press and hold on your screen and go to Edit \u003e Customize. Then, choose Light or Dark. Your app icons will change when in Dark Mode. I also like to sometimes select Automatic, which will automatically switch your app colors based on your other device settings. Neon and Futuristic Using the same method above, go to the Tinted tab and move the color slider to green. It should be roughly halfway between yellow and purple, but you want more of a luminous tint. After changing the colors, your screen should have all of its colors removed besides the shade of green that you've chosen. It's quite reminiscent of the color scheme in The Matrix. Shades of Blue Similar to the neon style, you can also try editing your screen in shades of blue for a more calming theme. For a darker shade, move your slider closer to purple. If you want a lighter shade of blue, look for more of a turquoise tone. You'll need to move the top slider between green and blue; for the second, I suggest moving it further to the left. Monochrome If you want to keep things simple with a monochrome look, move the bottom slider all the way to the right so that your app icons are black and white. Some system apps like Settings and Camera already use grayscale icons, so you don't need to worry about those. After creating your monochromatic app shortcuts, consider removing all the original apps from the Home Screen. The One-Hander Big screens are awesome, but reaching for icons at the farthest edges of the display can be a pain, literally. Instead of practicing fingertip yoga every time you want to open an app, why not keep your icons all down one side? Simply move your iPhone apps along one side of the screen; if necessary, consider doing this on multiple pages. The Bottom Line Apple knows that the bottom of the screen is prime real estate since it's the easiest part to reach. That's why the Dock is down there. Thus, it makes sense to ignore the top of the iPhone Home Screen completely and use blank icons to shift your app icons towards the bottom. If you need assistance implementing any of our Home Screen layouts that require creating blank icons, don't worry. We have a guide on creating a blank iPhone Home Screen using iEmpty. Work/Play With this layout, keep work-related apps on one page and entertainment apps that you only use outside of working hours go on another. Combine this with your iPhone's Focus feature to automatically hide your work Home Screen at the end of the workday. For even better productivity, use Downtime to disable everything on the play screen during working hours as well. The Heavy Load Can't decide how to organize your iPhone apps? Pack them into several folders so you don't need to swipe through endless Home Screens to view everything. It's best to organize your folders by app category: work, health, finance, entertainment, and so on. The App Library does this automatically, but you have no control over how each app is categorized. This is a much better option if you want to know exactly where to find each app. If you're struggling to think of good folder name ideas for this Home Screen layout, you could also use emojis to give quick, colorful representations for each one. Two-Page Priorities It's best to keep your most important apps within reach at all times. The easiest way to do this is to add your favorite four apps to the Dock, and then prioritize the next-most important apps on your first Home Screen. After that, add everything else into separate folders on the second Home Screen page, so everything's only a swipe away. Alternatively, only use a single Home Screen and relegate everything else to the App Library. Quick Access You probably have lots of apps installed on your iPhone. To make it easy to keep up with what's important and perform common actions quicker, you can use widgets provided by your essential apps. This is especially true with interactive widgets on your iPhone and iPad that Apple introduced alongside iOS 17. With interactive widgets, you may not need to open an app to perform a given action as long as it's offered via a widget. Simply tap any empty space in your Home Screen, then tap the Plus (+) button in the top-left corner to find and select the widgets you'd like to add. For important apps that don't have dedicated widgets, add them to the Dock. Using the Corners You probably have a few apps that you use more frequently than the others on your phone. While you can put a handful of them in the Dock, would it not be nicer to have fast access to all of them? Consider using the corners of your phone to gain easy access to your apps. With this screen layout, you'll have two apps in each corner. Organize them however you want; for example, you can group them by category or app color. Once you've done this, you can add three or four extra in the Dock. While Apple used to restrict how much you could edit your Home Screen, you now have plenty more options than before. With some creative thinking and simple tricks, you can make your device really stand out. You're not limited to these Home Screen layout ideas for your iPhone; feel free to take inspiration and make minor adjustments that suit your preferences to create the best iPhone Home Screen layout for you.",
