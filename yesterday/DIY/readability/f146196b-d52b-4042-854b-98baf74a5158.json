  "text": "Mark LoProto / How-To Geek HyperX Alloy Rise 75 Wireless HyperX Alloy Rise 75 features extensive customization, from RGB lighting to key inputs. Equipped with red linear switches, a gasket-mounted board, and three modes of connectivity, the Alloy Rise 75 caters to a casual and competitive gaming audience.   The HyperX Alloy Rise is getting a huge discount, which puts it at the lowest price point it has ever been. This high-end mechanical keyboard usually costs $169.99, but it is now on sale for $84.99 on Amazon. That is a 50% discount, pushing almost all the way to budget keyboard territory despite having top-quality features. The compact 75% size fits well in different setups while offering great functionality. The keyboard lets you swap out parts like the top plates, badges, and rotary knobs without tools, so you can make it look just how you want. Thanks to its handy USB-C connection, it works with PCs, laptops, tablets, phones, and gaming consoles. One of its best features is the hot-swappable design, which lets you easily change the switches to customize how the keyboard feels and responds. It supports both 3-pin and 5-pin MX-style switches, so you can pick the ones you like best. Beyond the hot-swappable switches, the Alloy Rise 75 has a unique typing feel with its gasket-mounted design. This special setup reduces harsh vibrations and makes typing more comfortable, even during long sessions. The keyboard comes with HyperX Linear Switches that are pre-lubricated for smooth keystrokes and are rated for 80 million presses, so it should last a long time. These switches use a half-wall POM stem for extra stability, especially when paired with the included high-quality PBT keycaps. There’s also a convenient top-mounted rotary knob for adjusting volume without pausing your game. The Alloy Rise 75 also has bright RGB lighting with a built-in ambient light sensor, a first for gaming keyboards. This sensor automatically adjusts the lighting based on your surroundings, creating a personalized and immersive effect. At just $84.99 on Amazon, this high-end keyboard is now within reach for many more people. This is a 50% reduction from its regular $169.99 price tag.",
