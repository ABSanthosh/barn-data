  "text": "After a few days of confusion, Google has officially confirmed issues with both the second-generation Chromecast and Chromecast Audio. Google Says There’s Currently No Fix to Casting Problems The problem occurs when you try to cast audio or video from a smart device to the larger TV screen. When attempting to send content, you’ll see an “Untrusted Device” error with the option to dismiss it. Google recently emailed users: We’re contacting you because of a disruption affecting Chromecast (2nd gen) and Chromecast Audio devices. We apologize for the issue and understand your frustration. We are working to roll out a fix as soon as possible and will share updates and guidance on the Nest Community page. We appreciate your patience as we resolve this issue. While Google acknowledges the issue, the company didn’t mention a cause. Google said specifically that users shouldn’t try to factory reset those models. If you do that, you will be completely frozen out of the devices. For anyone who has already done that, Google said it will send specific instructions on how to bring the Chromecasts back to life. For now, if you have one of those Chromecast devices, all you can do is sit back and wait while keeping your device plugged in and connected to the internet. Hopefully, Google will come to the rescue with a fix soon. There Are Other Ways to Mirror an iPhone or Android Device to a Big Screen If you have one of the Chromecast models having issues, there is a bit of good news. It’s still very easy to mirror your iPhone or Android screen to a TV with a modern smart TV. Android fans can mirror a device to the big screen with built-in casting features on supported apps and even directly from the Google Home app. You can connect an iPhone to your TV wirelessly using Apple’s AirPlay protocol, something available on most newer smart TVs.",
