  "text": "Sign in to your MUO account Microsoft debuted most of its more advanced AI features with Copilot+ PCs running Snapdragon X chipsets, which left a lot of Copilot+ PCs running Intel and AMD chips in the dark. Now, the company plans to expand to where its more advanced AI features are available, starting with select Intel- and AMD-powered PCs. Copilot+ AI Features Are Coming to Intel and AMD PCs Microsoft announced in a blog post that exclusive Copilot+ PC AI features like Live Captions, Cocreater, and more will be coming to all Copilot+ PCs powered by AMD Ryzen AI 300 series, Intel Core Ultra 200V, and Snapdragon X series processors. A full list of features is as follows: Live Captions: offers real-time translations in English for audio and video content during video playback, podcasts, or virtual meetings. Voice Access: lets users talk to their PCs in a more natural and flexible language. Cocreator in Paint: lets you create or edit images in pain with a combination of freehand drawing and text-based prompts. Restyle Image and Image Creator in Photos: brings AI-powered editing capabilities using prompts in the Windows Photos app. Keep in mind these features are optimized for English text prompts and require a Microsoft account and internet connection to function. In some cases, you might also require a Microsoft 365 subscription to access some features. Microsoft launched its Copilot+ PCs in May 2024, claiming them to be the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever. The decision to launch with Snapdragon's X Elite processors was also part of Microsoft's push for Windows on ARM, while also taking a shot at Apple with its M-series of custom silicon. Related AI PCs Are Here! But What Exactly Does That Mean, and What Can They Do? Keen to get involved with AI PC and laptops but not sure what they do? We've got you covered. Copilot+ PCs require a system that delivers at least 40 TOPs (trillion operations per second) of NPU performance. This means a dedicated onboard NPU and at least 16 GB of memory. Microsoft partnered with Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm to achieve the initial releases. However, other companies like Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung have been hard at work producing Copilot+ PCs that match Microsoft's requirements. When Can You Expect the Features? There is no fixed release date provided for the features at the moment. Microsoft says it will gradually roll out these features throughout April 2025 via the Windows controlled feature rollout (CFR). Some features are already available via the March 2025 Windows non-security preview update, which requires the November 2024 non-security preview update. To increase your chances of getting the features early, you can enable the Get the latest updates as soon as they're available option in Windows Update settings. Once done, you can check for updates to download and install the March non-security preview release as per Microsoft's instructions. Also, make sure that the Microsoft Paint and Photos apps are updated to their latest versions to access the new AI features. Given Microsoft's aggressive AI push, I doubt you'll have to wait long to see these features in action. At least, as long as you have a compatible PC.",
