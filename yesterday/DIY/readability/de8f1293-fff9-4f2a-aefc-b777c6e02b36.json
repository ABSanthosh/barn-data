In case you’re not a longtime blog reader, this is our weekly roundup of favorite things. It typically includes a book, television or media, a favorite recipe and recent purchases. 10 Things I Love 1. I’m currently reading Patti Smith’s memoir Just Kids. It’s beautiful and such a fantastic audiobook performance. I am really into it. Next up on my nonfiction list is Abundance. I’ve heard great things. 2. I just picked up a copy of Beautyland. Have you read it? If so, I’d love to hear your thoughts. 3. I’m currently renovating and about to choose wallpapers. I’m obsessed with this olive grove pattern and I recently added these butterflies in a little nook. 4. Now that the weather is beginning to warm up, I’m excited to use my Ninja Creami again. If you’re thinking of getting one, read my in-depth Ninja Creami review. 5. I’m having a cake phase and this cookbook looks so fun. 6. If you need a new suitcase, I love mine and highly recommend it. 7. Emma got me this tea leaf reading kit and it’s so much fun to use. My kids are obsessed. 8. My favorite cocktail glasses paired with my favorite cocktail. 9. If you’re into making collage art, this sticker book is my favorite. 10. Collecting art! I typically check Etsy and my favorite keywords are “vintage impressionist art,” “antique oil painting” or “antique oil painting portrait.” I love finding pieces at local flea markets as well.
