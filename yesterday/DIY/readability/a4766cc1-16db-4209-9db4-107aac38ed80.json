  "text": "ChatGPT Sign in to your MUO account ChatGPT is the most popular AI chatbot service out there, but there has been a strange absence of an official Windows app over the past year or two. If you've been waiting on an app for your desktop, today is your lucky day, as OpenAI has released a test build of its ChatGPT Windows app—with a minor catch. OpenAI Releases the ChatGPT Windows App for Paid Members As announced by OpenAI on X (formerly Twitter), the Windows app is now ready for testing. Once you've installed the app, you can invoke ChatGPT by pressing Alt + Space. This makes it a lot easier to talk to an AI model than going to OpenAI's website every time you want to write a prompt. There's just one catch—you must be a paying customer to log in and use the app. Fortunately, it doesn't matter what kind of paid account you have; OpenAI lists \"ChatGPT Plus, Enterprise, Team, and Edu users\" as valid options for using it. Plus, once OpenAI has ironed out all the bugs, it plans to open up the Windows app to free users too. Because the app is still in testing, you'll notice that some of ChatGPT's more complex features are missing. For instance, you can't use it to use the advanced voice mode to hold a vocal conversation with the AI. However, there's a good chance that OpenAI will add these missing features in future updates, so it's worth keeping an eye on the project at the very least. If you match all the requirements and want to give it a try, visit the ChatGPT page on the Microsoft Store and download it. And if you're stuck on what to ask the AI, now's a good time to test out its newest feature where ChatGPT reasons with you.",
