Before AT, I was an editor at HGTV Magazine and This Old House Magazine.published nowWe independently select these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.When I think about the areas of my home that are most beautiful, I’m generally thinking about my cozy living room or my relaxing bedroom — definitely not my garage, which can be a bit of a chaos magnet (perhaps you relate?). Even at its best, it is functional but not exactly attractive. But every once in a while, I see a project that convinces me that achieving both beauty and utility really is possible.Case in point: This garage entryway makeover I wrote about back in 2021, and which I still think of as the prettiest garage I’ve ever seen. The before is more in line with what I think of when I think of garages, with lots more stuff than there is storage space. Because it was also used as the family’s primary entrance, it needed to be able to handle daily use and easily store essentials so they were in reach to grab and go.The solution the DIYer behind this redo came up with was to create her own wall of cabinets and a bench where the family could pop on their shoes before hopping in the car. The assembly is completely packed with practical storage, thanks to two doored cabinets, a tall shelf, drawers in the bench, and hooks on the wall.If these cabinets look custom-made, it’s because they are — but not by a carpenter! The DIYer taught herself to make the cabinets out of plywood after seeing the price of pro installation. A blue-gray paint color and gold hardware give them a luxe look that honestly makes me forget I’m looking at a garage.The one thing I thought made this space extra special, though, was the attention to detail on the floor. Two different complementary tiles on both the stairs and the floor under the bench help make this zone barefoot-friendly, which is essential if you’re creating a spot to slip shoes on and off. Oh, and did I mention that the entire project cost just $500? This makeover truly is a standout in more ways than one.You can check out the whole redo here for inspiration and advice, plus some extra photos.
