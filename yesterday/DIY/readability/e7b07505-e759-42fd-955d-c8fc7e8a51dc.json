However, in an unprecedented move for me, after spending an extensive amount of time with it the past few weeks, I ended up selling it. Though I feared at first that I may have sold it a bit too quickly, I'm actually glad I did it, and for far more reasons than I initially realized. It Feels Like a Switch 1.5 Former Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios president Shuhei Yoshida accurately articulated my feelings about the Switch 2 during an interview with Easy Allies. When the Switch 2 was announced, he said he felt like Nintendo was losing its identity, and that he was \"a bit disappointed, because they didn't disappoint everyone.\" Nintendo's greatest strength is how much the company innovates. Though I understand it set the bar high with the Switch, it feels like its successor is simply a more powerful version of it. Yes, being able to use the Joy-Con as a mouse is nice, but that's really it as far as unique additions go. Even the social features are dated, and were incorporated by rival consoles several generations ago. The Switch is an incredible console, and many of us have been saying for years that a stronger Switch is really all we wanted. I acknowledge that as well as the fact that, from a business standpoint, Nintendo made a safe decision with the Switch 2. Nonetheless, I can't help but lament that for the next console generation, nothing is really going to change with how we play on their newest platform. The Current Software Lineup Doesn't Justify the Barrier to Entry Nintendo Since the Wii debuted, I've always viewed Nintendo's newest hardware as a supplement to either an Xbox or PlayStation. Their consoles have never been up to snuff power-wise with their competitors, but their first-party games have always been unmatched. Unfortunately, the Switch 2's lineup is sorely lacking on that front, and that includes third-party exclusives to the console. Nintendo's heavy hitter is undoubtedly Mario Kart World, considering that's the game they revealed with the Switch 2, and it's featured heavily in the console's marketing. Having spent dozens of hours with it, I can vouch that it's an amazing game, but it doesn't warrant the bare minimum $500 you must spend to play it, not to mention the other hidden costs of owning a Switch 2. As far as first-party exclusives go, that is the only completely new title available at launch. The rest are \"Switch 2 Editions\" of games we've already played before, or third-party games you've likely already played on other consoles or PC. Donkey Kong Bananza looks awesome, but that won't be out for another month, and third-party exclusives like The Duskbloods only have vague release windows. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is one of the titles I'm looking forward to the most this year, but it will also be available on the Switch. It'll play better on the Switch 2, and, admittedly, I wish I'd be able to use mouse controls, but it won't ruin the experience for me. People often say a console is an investment, and it absolutely is, but there isn't enough going for the Switch 2 at this moment for me to be able to justify keeping it. It will cost just as much a year or two down the line as it does now, and it'll have a significantly better lineup of games going for it, too. Other Portable Consoles Offer a Similar Experience JSAUX When I discussed software, you might have been thinking that playing games on the go is one of the biggest appeals of the Switch 2, but we're not hurting for options on that front. Sony, Microsoft, and other companies diving into PC hardware have seen how critically successful the Switch is, and now have their own versions of it. As soon as I acquired my Switch in 2017, I realized I wanted to be able to have that kind of portability with PC or PlayStation games, and now I do. Related I've had my Steam Deck for almost two years, and it's hard to imagine life without it. Having such easy access to almost my entire Steam library is such a boon, and the Switch 2 is asking me to pay for these games again for an almost identical experience. I will give credit to the Switch 2 and say it's nice to be able to play Switch games that run better on it, but that just goes back to my earlier point: if I can already play them on the Switch, why bother with the slight upgrade? You could say that physical game cartridges work in the Switch 2's favor since collectors will have a tangible version of the game, and they'll be saving precious storage space. Game cards kill that argument though, as it seems like the majority of third-party publishers are opting to use them. Offering the worst of both worlds, you're tethered to a physical cartridge while still needing the storage a digital purchase requires, plus you have to be online to download the game. Nintendo announced they have \"no plans\" to use game cards for first-party titles, but if most third-party publishers are, I can, once again, just use something like my Steam Deck. $80 Games and the C Button Leave a Bad Taste in My Mouth Nintendo Funnily enough, one of the most disappointing things about the Switch 2 for me isn't necessarily the console itself, but Nintendo's anti-consumer business practices that involve it. The most obvious is that games can now cost $80, such as Mario Kart World. I'm already of the mentality that asking people to spend $70 on games is a tall ask, but this increase isn't something I can support. Mario Kart World really does have a lot going for it, but it definitely does not earn its price tag. If all future DLC is free, I'd say it's worth $80, but if that were the case, Nintendo would have surely articulated that by now. There simply isn't enough single-player content, and to play with others online, you have to pay even more for a Nintendo Switch Online membership. On the subject of online, another upsetting aspect of the Switch 2 is that the C button is locked behind a paywall. That's right, if you want to use GameChat's social features, which Nintendo should have implemented several generations ago, you need a Nintendo Switch Online membership. I should note that there is an open-access period until March 31, 2026, so everyone can currently use it, but after that, you're out of luck. The C button is a big problem, and there's an easy fix, but we'll have to see if Nintendo changes their stance on it. With the way I've been talking about the Switch 2, you might think I detest it. I actually think it's a great console, and I'm sure most people who have one are enjoying their time with it. $450 is a fair price for what you get, and seeing so much third-party support is a big win for Nintendo. That being said, I noticed recently that every single time someone asked me if I recommended buying a Switch 2, my response was a very quick \"no.\" It was these conversations that made me realize I regretted buying one myself which led to me selling it. I've never sold a Nintendo console before and was afraid I'd been too hasty, but I honestly feel much better having done it. I'm sure down the line I'll revisit the idea of picking one up again, but it just doesn't have enough going for it right now.",

Having such easy access to almost my entire Steam library is such a boon, and the Switch 2 is asking me to pay for these games again for an almost identical experience. I will give credit to the Switch 2 and say it\u0026#39;s nice to be able to play Switch games that run better on it, but that just goes back to my earlier point: if I can already play them on the Switch, why bother with the slight upgrade?\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eYou could say that physical game cartridges work in the Switch 2\u0026#39;s favor since collectors will have a tangible version of the game, and they\u0026#39;ll be saving precious storage space. Game cards kill that argument though, as it seems like the majority of third-party publishers are opting to use them.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eOffering the worst of both worlds, you\u0026#39;re tethered to a physical cartridge while still needing the storage a digital purchase requires, plus you have to be online to download the game.

things about the Switch 2 for me isn\u0026#39;t necessarily the console itself, but Nintendo\u0026#39;s anti-consumer business practices that involve it. The most obvious is that games can now cost $80, such as \u003cem\u003eMario Kart World\u003c/em\u003e. I\u0026#39;m already of the mentality that asking people to spend $70 on games is a tall ask, but this increase isn\u0026#39;t something I can support.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMario Kart World \u003c/em\u003ereally does have a lot going for it, but it definitely does not earn its price tag. If all future DLC is free, I\u0026#39;d say it\u0026#39;s worth $80, but if that were the case, Nintendo would have surely articulated that by now. There simply isn\u0026#39;t enough single-player content, and to play with others online, you have to pay even more for a Nintendo Switch Online membership.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n    \n\u003cp\u003eOn the subject of online, another upsetting aspect of the Switch 2 is that the C button is locked behind a paywall. That\u0026#39;s right, if you want to use GameChat\u0026#39;s social features, which Nintendo should have implemented several generations ago, you need a Nintendo Switch Online membership. I should note that there is an open-access period until March 31, 2026, so everyone can currently use it, but after that, you\u0026#39;re out of luck. The \u003ca href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/the-nintendo-switch-two-c-button-has-a-big-problem-and-an-easy-fix/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eC button is a big problem, and there\u0026#39;s an easy fix\u003c/a\u003e, but we\u0026#39;ll have to see if Nintendo changes their stance on it.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003chr/\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the way I\u0026#39;ve been talking about the Switch 2, you might think I detest it. I actually think it\u0026#39;s a great console, and I\u0026#39;m sure most people who have one are enjoying their time with it. $450 is a fair price for what you get, and seeing so much third-party support is a big win for Nintendo. That being said, I noticed recently that every single time someone asked me if I recommended buying a Switch 2, my response was a very quick \u0026#34;no.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eIt was these conversations that made me realize I regretted buying one myself which led to me selling it. I\u0026#39;ve never sold a Nintendo console before and was afraid I\u0026#39;d been too hasty, but I honestly feel much better having done it. I\u0026#39;m sure down the line I\u0026#39;ll revisit the idea of picking one up again, but it just doesn\u0026#39;t have enough going for it right now.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
