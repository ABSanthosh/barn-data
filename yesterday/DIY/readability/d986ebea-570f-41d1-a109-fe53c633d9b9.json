  "text": "While bundle deals can save you money on multiple subscription services, Apple's premium bundle plan is known for its high price tag. To make up for that, Apple has just released two additional services for its Apple One Premier bundle. Apple One Premier Is Gaining Two New Services Apple One, a subscription that offers bundled Apple services in three tiers, has now added additional perks to its priciest plan called Premier. In addition to the current services included in Premier, Apple Invites and Apple News+ Food will soon join the party. According to Apple's website, a Premier plan will save you $29/month, when compared to paying for all six of its services à la carte. While $37.95/month is nothing to sneeze at, the current Premier monthly subscription includes 2TB of iCloud+ storage, Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Fitness+, and News+. Apple has now added Invites, and is set to add News+ Food in the upcoming iOS and iPadOS updates. According to Apple's Newsroom, iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 are expected sometime in April 2025. While Apple's new Invites app provides iCloud users with custom invitations and other event-planning tools, Apple News+ Food is an extension of the News app that brings you \"tens of thousands of recipes,\" from sources like Bon Appétit and Food \u0026 Wine. Will Apple Invites and Apple News+Food Justify the High Price? The two new additions raise Apple One Premier's total service count from six to eight, at no increase to the established $37.95/month. That sounds pretty good in theory, but it all depends on whether you actually use all eight services. To me, the heavy hitters in this bundle are the 2TB of storage on iCloud+, Apple TV+, and Apple Music. On their own, those three services cost: Service Price iCloud+ 2TB $9.99 Apple TV+ $9.99 Apple Music (Family plan) $16.99 Alone, those three services come out to $36.97, nearly the price of the bundle plan. Hence, as long as you're using at least those three, it's already essentially worth the cost—even without the other features like Fitness+, News+, and Invites. While I don't know (yet) anyone who has used Apple Arcade, I do know many who rely on Apple Fitness+, particularly those with an Apple Watch. However, as someone who does not track fitness outside my one running app, I can only go off of hearsay on that one. I can see Apple Invites being a welcome perk, whether you manage professional events or just love to throw parties. That said, you can use Apple Invites with any iCloud+ subscription. Meaning, theoretically, you could pay $0.99 for the lowest iCloud+ tier and still have access to Apple Invites. Apple News+ Food could add value for the right person, particularly for those who are not only looking for recipes but appreciate reading food journalism. This subscription could save you from multiple food magazine subscriptions. I certainly hope that Apple doesn't follow these two new freebies with a price increase in a few months. It wouldn't be the first time a company has done this, with Amazon Music raising its subscription prices only a few months after adding a \"free\" monthly audiobook perk. I wouldn't guess that these two particular apps would garner a rate change, but you just never know.",
