When his client had the same idea, handyman Matthew Jenkins came up with a design to convert a drab TV niche into a comfortable reading nook with storage. Matthew was tasked with the challenge of improving the storage of an old media alcove in his client’s home. They relocated the TV to a different wall and now had this ambiguous space. At first, the plan was to create ample display space and a mandir for religious worship. Photo Credit: Matthew Jenkins Eventually, the design morphed into two niches, one for the mandir and a separate one for a reading nook and storage, which was Matthew’s main focus. Now, I will say, this isn’t your average IKEA hack, because for one thing, it involves work done by a professional and also comes in at almost $5,000. It also features a lengthy list of IKEA materials (those alone come to $2,450), including SEKTION cabinets and MAXIMERA drawers. But it looks stellar, so we had to show it off. Plus, you never know what will inspire you, so this could be the motivation you need to get your own hack off the ground.

But you have to admit, it certainly inspires you to see what you can accomplish when you get creative and have a vision. Matthew Jenkins is based in the La Mesa, California area. He specializes in closet installations, especially ones showcasing IKEA’s versatile PAX system, but he’s got plenty of other skills. This cozy reading nook came to life after several design ideas and discussions with his clients. Matthew said, “The client had a very unique vision and wanted to execute it into a unique functional space.” As you can see from the shopping list, it features a bunch of IKEA pieces that all come together to form one cohesive and sophisticated custom built-in. Photo Credit: Matthew Jenkins The project features plenty of storage thanks to multiple cabinets, which Matthew mentions might be the most above-fridge cabinets used in one install. He opted for glass fronts in two of the cabinets to show off decorative pieces, highlighted by the MITTLED LED spotlights. Overcoming Challenges to Create A Beautiful Niche With Storage Photo Credit: Matthew Jenkins Even a skilled craftsman faces challenges when creating a custom piece. Matthew said he was grateful for his laser level, especially when stacking the many SEKTION cabinets on each other with the multiple suspension rails. It requires a lot of precision and patience. He also said using the FÖRBÄTTRA cover panel as a recessed buffer on the bottom cabinets was tricky. He did it to add a gap so the MAXIMERA drawer wouldn’t rub on the KARLBY countertop. Other adjustments came into play when Matthew had to create a custom height for one of the open fridge cabinets, and he had to account for a sloping ceiling and walls that weren’t perfectly square. (He points out that this is a common challenge in many projects like this, since walls and ceilings are never truly plumb.) But the solution came in using the panels to help trick the eye into making everything look straight. Matthew also had to work with certain things that were already in place from the general contractor, like outlets. Since the design evolved, he said he would have liked to have been able to move or put the outlets where he wanted them instead of having to work around what was there. He also paid close attention to the order he added the cover panels and made sure to hide seams as much as possible. But overall, despite the challenges, Matthew is proud of the finished reading nook and storage space. He’s happy that he was able to create an area the family can enjoy that isn’t all about the TV. What do you think? Would you love to have something like this in your home? Would you use it for reading or something else?

But the solution came in using the panels to help trick the eye into making everything look straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew also had to work with certain things that were already in place from the general contractor, like outlets. Since the design evolved, he said he would have liked to have been able to move or put the outlets where he wanted them instead of having to work around what was there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"block-wrap-37206\" data-id=\"37206\"\u003e\t\t\u003carticle\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ikeahackers.net/2023/10/narrow-bench-vintage.html\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" width=\"120\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/narrow-bench-for-living-room-120x120.jpeg\" alt=\"narrow bench diy aged and distressed\" srcset=\"https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/narrow-bench-for-living-room-120x120.jpeg 120w, https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/narrow-bench-for-living-room-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/narrow-bench-for-living-room-600x600.jpeg 600w, https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/narrow-bench-for-living-room-240x240.jpeg 240w, https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/narrow-bench-for-living-room-360x360.jpeg 360w, https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/narrow-bench-for-living-room-540x540.jpeg 540w, https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/narrow-bench-for-living-room-720x720.jpeg 720w, https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/narrow-bench-for-living-room-125x125.jpeg 125w, https://ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/narrow-bench-for-living-room-96x96.jpeg 96w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" title=\"Beat up an IKEA narrow bench for amazing vintage vibes 3\"/\u003e\t\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\u003c/article\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe also paid close attention to the order he added the cover panels and made sure to hide seams as much as possible.
