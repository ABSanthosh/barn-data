  "text": "I'm sure I'm not alone in often struggling to make decisions. It's not just the big decisions, such as whether to move house or change jobs, but also everyday minutiae, like what to eat for dinner or what to watch on TV. Our lives are all punctuated by a never-ending succession of decisions, both big and small. And that can sometimes feel overwhelming. Thankfully, artificial intelligence, and (in my case) ChatGPT in particular, can help. Using ChatGPT to Help Me Make Decisions We all make multiple decisions every single day. And that can sometimes feel a little overwhelming. So, when the number of decisions I need to make starts racking up, and I start to feel a little overwhelmed as a result, I turn to ChatGPT for help. Related What Are Large Language Models (LLMs) and How Do They Work? Generative AI is all the rage, but how does a large language model work? As a large language model, ChatGPT can analyze the information I feed it and logically spit out an answer. So, with some sensible prompting, you can have ChatGPT make decisions for you. Or, if you don't like the answer it provides, use ChatGPT's responses to make your own mind up. Which Restaurant Should I Visit Next? My partner and I try to eat out at restaurants fairly often. And while it isn't always possible due to stretched times and budgets, when we do venture out, we like to try new places. But which restaurants should we visit? After all, there are dozens of decent restaurants within traveling distance, so how do we sort the wheat from the chaff and narrow the many options down to just a few? ChatGPT is an ideal tool to assist with this decision. I tend to start broadly, before providing more information to help ChatGPT narrow in on its choices. The important details are what location you're referring to, what type of cuisine you're considering, and the budget you have available. With these three pieces of information, ChatGPT can provide a list of choices for you to pick from, allowing you to make the final decision. Where's the Best Place to Go on Vacation? My partner and I are fortunate enough to be able to go on vacation once a year, providing a nice respite from the pressures of work and home life. However, with just one or two weeks available each year, deciding where to go on vacation becomes an important thing to get right. The first question that needs answering is where to go on vacation, followed closely by where to stay in that location. As with all of these decisions, ChatGPT requires some information before it can help you choose. In this case, the pertinent information is the type of holiday you're looking to go on (from a relaxing beach holiday to a cultural city break), the budget you have available, and the time of year you want to travel. Provide this, and ChatGPT will offer suggestions that can then be refined further with additional prompts. Once you have decided where to go, you should consider using Google Maps to make your vacations better. Which PS5 Game Should I Play Next? After sticking with my PS4 for a long time, in 2024, I finally took the plunge and purchased a PS5. Since then, I have purchased several games, and have a huge back catalog of PlayStation Plus games available too. Which raises the dilemma of which game to play next? With free time at a premium once you reach adulthood and all the responsibilities that come with that, not wasting time on bad games is important. You can ask ChatGPT to decide from the list of games you already have available, or allow it to direct you to all the games available for PS5. Either way, you should provide the AI chatbot with the genres of games you generally enjoy playing, whether you enjoy single-player or multiplayer games, and whether you want a short burst of gaming fun or a longer challenge. You can also list games you have previously enjoyed playing. In What Order Should I Tackle My To-Do List? I suspect everyone reading this has a to-do list, whether you have it written down or it's just in your head. There's always something that needs doing, whether at work or regarding your home life. But in what order should you tackle your to-do list? What tasks should be prioritized over others? Ticking things off your to-do list in the best order is crucial in order to keep everyone happy and life moving in the right direction. To have ChatGPT help you tackle your to-do list, you just need to feed your to-do list into the AI chatbot. This can either be in the form of a bulleted list or a random brain dump. Either way, ChatGPT will help you organize it and prioritize certain tasks over others. ChatGPT can do this based on your own preferences, whether that's urgency, importance, time required, or anything else that's important to you. What Improvements Should I Make to My Home? If you're lucky enough to own your own home, you'll know that there are always jobs that need doing. Many of these jobs are just maintenance, with certain appliances and elements needing to be maintained regularly. However, you should also consider making home improvements in order to make your house a nicer place to live and/or increase its value when it comes time to sell and move on to new pastures, especially if the home improvements you're making involve smart technology. ChatGPT can list a whole range of home improvements you should consider doing, either to make your home a nicer place to live or increase its potential value when selling it. Once ChatGPT provides its initial list of potential home improvements to make, you can provide further prompts to direct ChatGPT to help you further. Naming particular rooms, particular issues, your budget, the type of home you own, and/or how long you plan on staying there before selling can all help direct ChatGPT. What Career Path Should I Pursue? With job markets ever-evolving, chances are that most of us will need to switch career paths at least once in our working lives. Having been a freelance writer and editor for 20 years, I'm facing the dilemma of whether to stay in this field until I retire or switch paths now before I get too old to do so. But if I decide to switch, what would the best career path be for me to pursue, given my current experience and skill set? ChatGPT can help direct you down certain career paths based on the information you provide. That information includes your interests and passions, your skills and strengths, and your level of education. The best thing to do is zero in on what's important to you. If you would prefer to work in a field that aligns with your values, for example, focus on that over the potential salary level of each potential profession. How ChatGPT Has Improved My Decision-Making Process ChatGPT has helped me make decisions in several ways. As you can see above, it has literally made decisions for me when asked, taking the mental burden off my shoulders and onto the shoulders of the large language model that powers ChatGPT. Whether it's big decisions or small ones, ChatGPT has helped resolve some dilemmas for me. The other, equally important way that ChatGPT has helped is by showing me how to work through problems to make better decisions for myself. By observing how ChatGPT approaches decision-making through a logical process, I have acquired some new techniques.",
