You can also use the Translate app to speak entered or translated text.Don't Miss: Make Siri Say Whatever You Want Every Time You Connect Your iPhone to a ChargerBut there are some free hidden tools built into iOS that can make Siri read aloud webpages, any text on the screen, or just a selection of text, so all you have to do is listen. The trick is finding them. They're great for multitasking, for those with visual impairments, or for anyone who prefers auditory learning.Make Safari read webpages to youWith iOS 17 or later installed, open Safari to a webpage you want to have narrated to you. Then, tap the Page Settings button on the left side of the address bar. Next, tap Listen to Page, and your iPhone will begin reading the page from the start. For a more hands-free experience, you can tell Siri to \"Read this page\" to you.You can also access the Listen to Page button when Reader is active. Just tap the Reader icon in the address bar to find it.For additional options, open Page Settings again (the button will now look like a speaker icon during narration). From here, you can adjust the speaking rate, pause, continue, skip back, or skip forward. On iOS 17, you can also end listening, an option missing from iOS 18 for some reason. On iOS 17, tap More Controls from the listening menu to reveal the rest of the Page Settings menu (it's already visible on iOS 18).Don't Miss: 28 Safari Gestures Every iPhone User Should Know for Faster Browsing Make your iPhone read selected text onlyTo have your iPhone read whatever text you select in almost any app, you'll utilize the hidden Speak Selection tool. First, ensure it's activated by going to Settings » Accessibility » Spoken Content and toggling on Speak Selection.Another option, Highlight Content, will appear, where you can have Speak Selection highlight words, sentences, or both with a background color or underline. You can also change the voice, default language, speaking rate, and more from the Spoken Content menu.For narration, simply highlight the text you wish to hear in an app like Notes, Mail, Books, or Safari, and then find and tap Speak from the options menu. This feature works seamlessly in almost any app, whether an Apple or third-party app. Speak Selection is also great at telling you the names of emoji.Full Guide: The One Hidden Feature Every iPhone Owner Can Benefit From Make your iPhone speak everything on the screenIf you want your iPhone to read a webpage in Safari where the Listen to Page feature doesn't work, entire news articles in the Apple News app, or anything else in almost any app, you'll utilize the hidden Speak Screen tool. First, ensure it's activated by going to Settings » Accessibility » Spoken Content and toggling on Speak Screen.Highlight Content will also appear if it's not visible in Spoken Content already. As with Speak Selection, you can have Speak Screen highlight words, sentences, or both with a background color or underline. You can also change the voice, default language, speaking rate, and more from the Spoken Content menu.After you turn on Speak Screen, another option called Speech Controller appears underneath. Tap it and toggle on Show Controller if you want the controller on your screen at all times for easier access (there's a shortcut to unhide it if you don't want it visible all the time, as you'll soon see). You can also set up shortcuts for long pressing and double tapping, as well as adjust the opacity of the button while idle.For screen narration in nearly any app, simply tap the Speech Controller icon and hit the play button. If you don't have Speech Controller always on, swipe down with two fingers from the top of the screen. You can then use Speech Controller to customize the playback in the moment. Check out our full guide for more information.Full Guide: Your iPhone Has a Hidden Text-to-Speech Tool That'll Read Articles, Books, News, and Other Text Out Loud to YouIf reading a webpage on Safari, long-press or touch and hold the Page Settings button to activate Reader View, then use Speak Screen. This can eliminate distractions that Speak Screen may otherwise read without. Make your iPhone speak elements you tapIf you ever need to make your iPhone tell you what a button says, a menu item, specific web content, and other on-screen elements, you can use the Speech Controller. Follow the directions above to show the Speech Controller, then tap the finger icon in the controller's menu. Next, tap a button, section of text, or other element to hear Apple narrate or explain it. Make your iPhone speak what you typeIf you want your iPhone to tell you aloud everything you type, go to Settings » Accessibility » Spoken Content » Typing Feedback, then toggle on the features that you'd like to use. Speak Words will only read words you type, Characters will speak out letters, numbers, and other characters, Character Hints will speak letters phonetically, Speak Auto-Text automatically speaks anything autocorrected, and Hold to Speak Predictions does precisely what it sounds like — reads you whatever you press and hold in the suggestions bar.The selected voice, default language, speaking rate, and other settings in the Spoken Content menu also apply to these more intricate text-to-speech options.More Info: 32 Things You Didn't Know About Your iPhone's KeyboardDon't Miss: Safari's Secret Weapon to Distraction-Free Browsing Gives You Complete Control Over Webpage AnnoyancesCover photo and screenshots by adget Hacks.",
