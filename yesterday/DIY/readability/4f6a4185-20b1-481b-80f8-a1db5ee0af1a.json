All it takes is a few tweaks to make it feel more personal, stylish, and uniquely yours. 7 Try Galaxy AI-Powered Wallpapers You glance at your phone's home screen probably hundreds of times a day, so changing it is one of the easiest ways to refresh your Galaxy phone's look. But finding that perfect wallpaper is often easier said than done. Instead of sticking with the default options or downloading wallpaper apps to find new ones, you can use AI to create a wallpaper yourself—as long as you have a Samsung phone that supports Galaxy AI. Go to Settings \u003e Wallpaper and style \u003e Change wallpapers, then tap Create with AI. Browse through various options to select the type of wallpaper you want. Once you pick a style, you can tweak the prompt to guide the AI and shape the design. You can easily switch up your home screen wallpaper every few days to keep it fresh. And if you don't want to do it manually, try an automatic wallpaper changer app to rotate through your wallpapers on a schedule. 6 Apply a Color Palette That Matches Your Wallpaper Once you’ve set your wallpaper, the next step is to pull everything together with a matching color palette. It’s a subtle change, but can make a huge difference. Your icons, quick settings, menus, and notifications will all take on complementary tones. To try it out, go to Settings \u003e Wallpaper and style, then tap Color palette. You'll see a few color combinations automatically pulled from your current wallpaper. Pick one that fits your vibe, and your phone will apply it across system UI elements. You can also apply the palette to your app icons, so the entire interface follows the same visual theme. 5 Change Your App Icons Aside from your wallpaper, app icons have the biggest impact on how your phone looks at a glance. Default icons from different apps often come in varying shapes, colors, and styles, which can make your home screen feel cluttered and inconsistent. To fix this, go to Settings \u003e Themes, then switch to the Icons tab. You’ll find a wide selection of icon packs—most of them paid, but worth a scroll. If you're looking for free options, scroll down to the Must-Have Free Icons section. You can also switch to the Top tab to explore the most popular downloads. Once you’ve found a pack that fits your look, simply tap Download or Pay, then apply it. 4 Personalize Your Samsung Keyboard Theme You constantly use your keyboard to type messages, search the web, and jot down notes, so it deserves some attention. While most keyboard apps only offer basic light and dark themes, Samsung's Keys Cafe lets you customize your keyboard exactly the way you like. It's one of many Good Lock modules that's worth installing on your Samsung phone. The Keys Cafe app only works with the Samsung Keyboard. If you're using a different keyboard app like Gboard or SwiftKey, you’ll need to switch back first. Once you’ve downloaded KeysCafe from the Galaxy Store, select Style your own keyboard to change colors, add lighting effects, and pick new sounds for key taps. You can also choose the Make your own keyboard to build a custom keyboard from scratch. This will allow you to resize keys, rearrange them, tweak the layout, and choose different styles. Under the Colors tab, pick a background that matches your wallpaper or color palette. You can even upload a custom image from your gallery. Go to the Effects tab to add animated keypress visuals. Finally, in the Sound tab, select the key sound that suits your vibe. 3 Customize the Always On Display The Always On Display is a handy feature for checking essential information like notifications and weather at a glance, but you don’t have to settle for the plain clock style. With the Good Lock app on your Samsung phone, you can download the ClockFace plugin to fully customize how your Always On Display looks. After installing Good Lock from the Galaxy Store, open it and download the ClockFace module. Once inside, head to the Face tab to browse through a variety of stylish clock designs. If none of them feel quite right, tap the plus icon in the top-right corner to design your own from scratch. You can then change the clock style, font, color, and size to better match your wallpaper or overall theme. To make it more fun, you can add your favorite emoji, sticker, GIF, or even an image from the Gallery. Your customized Always On Display clock will also apply to the lockscreen clock, so everything looks uniform. Widgets can make your Android home screen way more useful. But if the default widget styles feel out of place with your wallpaper or theme, you can use KWGT Kustom Widget Maker to bring everything together. It lets you design completely custom widgets that blend perfectly with your home screen's look. After downloading the app from the Play Store, add a KWGT widget to your home screen just like you would with any other. Then tap on it to dive into the editing interface. From there, you can either build a widget from scratch or import a premade one and tweak it to your liking. If you want to import pre-designed widgets from packs (many of which look stunning), you’ll need to upgrade to KWGT Pro, which costs $5.99. You can adjust fonts, colors, shapes, and backgrounds, and even add dynamic elements like battery percentage, weather info, or upcoming calendar events. The interface might feel overwhelming at first, but it becomes easy to navigate once you get the hang of it. KWGT uses a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor, so what you design is exactly what appears on your screen. 1 Use Theme Park to Design Your Own Theme You don’t have to limit yourself to customizing the home screen, lock screen, app drawer, and AOD of your Samsung phone. With Good Lock’s Theme Park module, you can customize the look of your Quick Settings panel, notifications shade, and even the volume sliders. Once you’ve downloaded Theme Park from the Galaxy Store, open the app and tap Create New. You’ll have the option to tweak the color of every element in the Quick Settings panel—from toggles and sliders to background shades and text colors. Similarly, you can jump over to the Volume Panel tab to customize the colors of your volume controls. There’s also a preview feature that lets you see how your design will look in both light and dark mode, so you can make sure it looks good no matter your system theme. Personalizing your Samsung phone is something everyone can enjoy, to some extent. The options above are a few easy ways to change how your device looks and feels. But you don’t have to stop there. Samsung offers plenty of other Good Lock modules to take your customization even further. LockStar lets you redesign your lock screen layout, NavStar allows you to personalize navigation buttons or gesture hints, and others let you tweak everything from the app switcher layout to the Edge panel.",
