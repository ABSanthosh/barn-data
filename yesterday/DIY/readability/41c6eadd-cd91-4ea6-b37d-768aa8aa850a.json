The company has announced a Virtual Unpacked event set for Monday, May 12, at 8 PM ET, where it will reveal the highly anticipated Galaxy S25 Edge. The Galaxy S25 was briefly shown off at January's Galaxy Unpacked event, but the full reveal will happen on May 12 at Samsung’s YouTube channel. Samsung has stressed the Galaxy S25 Edge's focus on delivering an extremely thin and lightweight phone without cutting back on power or capabilities. This emphasis on portability is supposed to be a direct response to what users have been asking for. Apparently, users have been wanting sleek and easy-to-carry devices that still deliver the high performance expected from a top-tier phone. I use a phone case, so I am usually surprised by how thin my Samsung Galaxy phone actually is whenever I take it out. However, plenty of people want thinner phones, so there might be a market for this phone. Apple is also supposedly working on a thinner iPhone. Related Grab a Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 for Under $200 Samsung's Galaxy Watch 7 is now on sale for an impressive price of $199.99 on Amazon. This is a full $100 off its original price of $299.99. This deal is a great opportunity for anyone who wants the newest Samsung smartwatch. A key part of the S25 Edge’s design is its incredibly slim shape, which was made possible by improvements in precise engineering. Samsung claims that every detail, from the curves to the internal parts, shows a focus on polished looks and a premium user experience. Beyond its appearance, the S25 Edge uses advanced AI integration. This AI is meant to improve the user experience in many ways. This is supposed to make the phone essential for staying connected, being creative, and getting work done. This is especially clear in the phone’s camera system. The camera features of the Galaxy S25 Edge are a supposed to be a big improvement in mobile photography. With a 200-megapixel wide lens, the phone provides professional-quality photos, letting users take extremely sharp and colorful pictures. Additionally, the AI turns the camera into a smart lens, automatically recognizing subjects and scenes to adjust settings for the best possible shots. The AI also helps with editing and sharing images, making improving and distributing photos after they’re taken easier. Samsung claims the S25 Edge brings major upgrades across many areas of smartphone functionality. The company did not share how it will be an upgrade, but it is clear that Samsung thinks the S25 Edge will raise the bar for smartphone performance and design. To encourage early purchases, Samsung is offering a $50 Samsung credit to customers who pre-order the phone. It's honestly not much, especially considering that newer flagship phones tend to cost over $1,000, so you really shouldn't take this credit into account when pre-ordering. It's not clear yet how much the Galaxy S25 Edge will cost. If you're interested, make sure to go to the official Samsung pages, preferably YouTube, on May 12 at 8pm ET. This will be when we find out what is happening with the new Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. Source: Samsung Android",

With a 200-megapixel wide lens, the phone provides professional-quality photos, letting users take extremely sharp and colorful pictures.
