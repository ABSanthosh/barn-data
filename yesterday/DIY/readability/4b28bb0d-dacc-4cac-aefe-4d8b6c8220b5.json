  "text": "Quick Links An Artist's Discography Isn't Consistent Playlists Can Be Curated Based on Mood and Genre Playlists Help Me Gauge What I Feel Like Listening To Listening to a curated playlist based on a prompt, mood, or genre can be just as much of a unique experience as a proper album. These are significant reasons that immediately come to mind. An Artist's Discography Isn't Consistent I can’t think of any band or music artist that doesn’t have one or two stinkers. Not all their music is printed on gold-plated discs. Sometimes their worst material is an entire album, or maybe just a handful of songs. With playlists, I can scrap the songs I don’t care for and keep the ones I do. I try to follow a strict rule though: if it’s part of a concept album, keep the songs together. Those are albums where each song is connected, creating a theme—like Marilyn Manson’s Triptych. I prefer listening to concept albums from start to finish, especially when I’m listening with the front of my brain, a good pair of headphones—and, as corny as it sounds, my heart. Otherwise, it feels like I’m reading random chapters of a book. Playlists Can Be Curated Based on Mood and Genre When I create playlists, it’s to serve a particular purpose—a mood, genre, or to enjoy my favorite songs. I’m not entirely concerned with quality; it’s there to serve as candy for my brain while I work. But when I do listen to albums, it’s strictly done on CDs. For example, when I’m feeling gloomy, I tend to sink into a mix of Alice in Chains, Nine Inch Nails, and a hodgepodge of handpicked songs from The Smiths, Nirvana, and lo-fi. Of course, this extends to genres, too. If I’m in no particular mood and just want to jam, give me a combination of Megadeth, Cradle of Filth, and metal any day of the week. I even go as far as to curate a playlist based on fictional stories I’m working on. As I’m working out the scenes in my head, it’s almost always accompanied by music. It serves as a muse, of sorts, allowing me to sink into the mood of the story. Playlists Help Me Gauge What I Feel Like Listening To I listen to playlists and albums in almost equal amounts, but the true power of a playlist is when I'm in an audio lull. When I have no idea what I'm in the mood for, I retreat to a playlist of my favorite songs. This usually leads to multiple listens of a particular song or two. And when that happens, I almost always listen to the album that song comes from. Put me in a vacuum with NiN's The Becoming, and suddenly, I want to listen to all of The Downward Spiral. Sometimes a single track has that kind of pull. I Love Burning Mix CDs I do very little music streaming; I prefer owning my music instead. One of the most useful benefits of this is getting to burn mix CDs. Perhaps it’s a bit archaic these days, given the ability to stream music, but I’d rather not run up my mobile data bill. A mix CD is the next best thing! Part of the fun is creating mix CDs based on a prompt, silly or otherwise. “Songs That Make Me Think of Winter” or “Songs That Would Fit in a Marvel Movie” or “Songs That Put Me to Sleep” are just a few examples. That's way more entertaining and challenging than \"Best Pop Songs of 2020\". However, the real fun of having a mix CD isn’t just to enjoy, but to share as well. Many of the people in my family listen to a lot of the same music. Any mix CD I make is inevitably loaned and forgotten about, and it's a great feeling knowing someone else can enjoy it. What matters most is that music playlists feel personalized. That's when they're at their best; otherwise, albums beat random playlists every single time. To me, a well-curated playlist has the power to make me revisit albums I've heard a million times. That's what I want out of every playlist I create.",

Sometimes a single track has that kind of pull.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"i-love-burning-mix-cds\"\u003e\n                        I Love Burning Mix CDs\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                                        \n    \n    \n    \u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/a-mix-cd-with-an-assortment-of-songs.jpg\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\"\u003e\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n        \u003cpicture\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/a-mix-cd-with-an-assortment-of-songs.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/a-mix-cd-with-an-assortment-of-songs.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/a-mix-cd-with-an-assortment-of-songs.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/a-mix-cd-with-an-assortment-of-songs.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 481px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/a-mix-cd-with-an-assortment-of-songs.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/a-mix-cd-with-an-assortment-of-songs.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/a-mix-cd-with-an-assortment-of-songs.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/a-mix-cd-with-an-assortment-of-songs.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n                \u003cimg width=\"2100\" height=\"1400\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"a mix cd with an assortment of songs\" data-img-url=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/a-mix-cd-with-an-assortment-of-songs.jpg\" src=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/12/a-mix-cd-with-an-assortment-of-songs.jpg\"/\u003e\n    \u003c/picture\u003e\n                                    \n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e I do very little music streaming; \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/prefer-owning-music-over-streaming/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI prefer owning my music\u003c/a\u003e instead. One of the most useful benefits of this is getting to burn mix CDs. Perhaps it’s a bit archaic these days, given the ability to stream music, but I’d rather not run up my mobile data bill. A mix CD is the next best thing!\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003ePart of the fun is creating mix CDs based on a prompt, silly or otherwise. “Songs That Make Me Think of Winter” or “Songs That Would Fit in a Marvel Movie” or “Songs That Put Me to Sleep” are just a few examples. That\u0026#39;s way more entertaining and challenging than \u0026#34;Best Pop Songs of 2020\u0026#34;.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the real fun of having a mix CD isn’t just to enjoy, but to share as well. Many of the people in my family listen to a lot of the same music. Any mix CD I make is inevitably loaned and forgotten about, and it\u0026#39;s a great feeling knowing someone else can enjoy it.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhat matters most is that music playlists feel personalized. That\u0026#39;s when they\u0026#39;re at their best; otherwise, \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/why-streaming-albums-are-better-than-random-playlists/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ealbums beat random playlists\u003c/a\u003e every single time. To me, a well-curated playlist has the power to make me revisit albums I\u0026#39;ve heard a million times. That\u0026#39;s what I want out of every playlist I create.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
