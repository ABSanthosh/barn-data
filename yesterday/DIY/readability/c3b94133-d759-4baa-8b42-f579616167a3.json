The UBP-X700/K Is Sony’s First New Blu-ray Player Since 2018 First spotted by Flatpanelshd, the new UBP-X700/K from Sony will be available in April or May, depending on your region. The new player is a refreshed version of the UBP-X700 that originally hit the market all the way back in 2018. While the new option looks identical to the previous model, it is missing some significant features. Japanese publication Monohika lists five differences between UBP-X700/K and UBP-X700: No Video \u0026 TV SideView app No networking features No video streaming apps No Spotify Connect support No Screen Mirroring support While there is apparently no Wi-Fi support, the player does feature a built-in, old-school Ethernet port. The model also comes with two HDMI outputs and support for HDR10 and Dolby Vision along with both Dolby Atmos and DTS:X audio. You can play UHD Blu-ray discs, regular Blu-rays, and DVDs. There’s no word on how much the Blu-ray player will set you back, but you may need to be prepared to spend a bit more. The player is currently available in Japan and costs 25 percent more than the previous model. It will be interesting to see if that price increase translates to the United States. Streaming services are absolutely everywhere and give viewers a world of content at the push of a button. But there are some significant downsides, like how streaming services can change or delete your favorite TV show or movie with no notice. So there are still some reasons why you want to use physical media in the world of streaming. And if you want the absolute best 4K quality, 4K Blu-rays have a higher video bitrate, providing noticeably better quality than streaming services. Even though there are some advantages to the old-school physical media, I sold all my Blu-rays years ago and haven’t looked back. The world of streaming is just too enticing and easy.",
