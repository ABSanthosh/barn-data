I’m eternally grateful for the early days of makeshift furniture as it sparked something unexpected in me: a curiosity in transforming affordable IKEA pieces into something extraordinary. Through years of experimentation and countless hours scrolling for IKEA hacks, I’ve discovered creative ways to elevate these affordable pieces into something special. Let me share what I’ve picked up in my quest for a cozy living room. Top 12 IKEA Hacks For A Stylish Living Room 1. Upgrade Your Coffee Table 2. Create a Custom Media Center Photo Credit: Doug Holmes 3. Stylish Storage with KALLAX Photo Credit: Joni Hames The KALLAX might be IKEA’s most versatile piece. Ever. Over the years, IKEA has also added to the range, making it even more hackable. They now offer underframes that lift the unit off the floor, however, different leg styles will change the piece’s personality. Hairpin legs create an airy, mid-century feel, while chunky wooden feet transform it into something that could pass for vintage storage. For the cushioning, skip the standard foam – it compresses too quickly with regular use. Instead, I layer high-density upholstery foam with a thin memory foam topper. This combination has survived countless movie nights and impromptu gatherings without losing its shape. Wrap the foam in batting before adding fabric. It smooths out any angles and gives that professional, upholstered look.Here are even more IKEA KALLAX hacks to inspire you. 4. Transform Your Sofa with Slipcovers Photo Credit: Jenny Bergstrom You can completely change the style of your sofa by adjusting the slipcover design. I would recommend skipping the slipcover options at IKEA as they are more of the same. Opt for something with more appeal like a sassy skirt. Interior designer Mallory @malloryinteriors discovered that a $17 bed skirt could transform an IKEA SÖDERHAMN sofa into something that looks straight out of a boutique showroom. It’s the kind of brilliant hack that makes you wonder why you ever stuck with standard covers. 5. Floating Shelves for Display Create an eye-catching floating shelf display with IKEA MOSSLANDA picture ledges. The trick is to flip these picture ledges, as demonstrated by Ashley from @east_shore_home. This ingenious approach is ideal for narrow areas where depth is at a premium.By inverting the ledges, you gain additional surface area to showcase your artwork, plants, or favorite books. The real magic, however, lies beneath: discreetly tuck a strip of lights under the shelf to cast a warm, ambient glow. This simple addition instantly elevates your living room’s ambiance, infusing it with a touch of luxury. @east_shore_home Step by step tutorial on how I elevated these basic Ikea Mosslanda shelves and installed led lighting. Wall panels are from @Orac Decor and all the products are linked in my bio. Led lights and extension pack as well as ratchet screwdriver are pinned in my Amazon storefront. #ikeahack #diytutorial #shelf ♬ original sound – Ashley | DIY \u0026 Interiors 6. Maximize Space Behind The Couch Photo Credit: BigBonsai 7. Built-In Bookshelves With Open And Closed Storage Photo Credit: Katja Nordkvist BILLY bookcases are the go-to for built-in bookshelves. To create a more versatile storage system the BILLY bookshelves can be combined with other IKEA cabinetry such as the KNOXHULT kitchen cabinets, LOMMARP cabinets, or BESTÅ units.Arrange them along a wall, add trim and molding to the edges, and paint them to match your wall color for a seamless look. Add some under-cabinet lighting to highlight your books and decor, giving your living room a cozy, inviting feel. 8. Cozy Window Seat Turn an awkward window nook into a cozy window seat with storage using a couple of IKEA cabinets. Many DIYers choose the BESTÅ for this hack, but it can also be done using EKET cabinets, SEKTION fridge top cabinets, SMÅSTAD benches, or a KALLAX 1×4 unit. Choose the IKEA furniture best suited to your space and budget. 9. Ambient Lighting Ditch the harsh overhead lighting in favor of a layered lighting approach. Try sneaking in this cute IKEA mushroom lamp hack to enhance the visual appeal of your space. 10. Incorporate Greenery IKEA glass cabinets like the RUDSTA and MILSBO aren’t marketed for plants, but IKEA hackers have found them perfect for plants. Add grow lights and USB fans, and transform them into incredible terrariums. Add copper pipe fittings as supports for climbing plants and acrylic shelves (from Etsy) to get even more plants in. It’s a great way to create a living art piece that thrives even in a low-light living room. 11. Upgrade Your Window Treatments Photo Credit: Süreyya Tuncer @sues_daily | Instagram When it comes to windows, don’t stop short with curtains. Elevate your windows with a budget-friendly DIY curtain pelmet box using the IKEA MOSSLANDA picture ledge. This clever hack transforms your windows, adding a polished, custom look without the hefty price tag. Simply mount the MOSSLANDA ledge upside down above your curtain rod, creating a sleek box to conceal curtain hardware. For added flair, paint the ledge to match your decor or wrap it in a complementary fabric. 12. Cover The Radiator Transform that unsightly radiator into a stylish focal point with a clever IKEA cabinet hack. Repurpose the IVAR cabinets to create a chic radiator cover that adds flair to your living room without obstructing heat circulation. Hannah used a custom MDF front instead of the IVAR doors. You can still use the doors but they will look less streamlined compared to Hannah’s hack. Customize the shape of the cut-outs, ensuring the doors are still usable and allow for proper heat circulation. Paint or refinish the cabinet to match your decor.
