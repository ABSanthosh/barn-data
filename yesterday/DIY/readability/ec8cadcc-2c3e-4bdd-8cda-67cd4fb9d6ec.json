From better picture and sound quality to voice control and so much more, these AI-powered features are making smart TVs so much better! Better Voice Control and Interaction Thanks to AI-driven virtual assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant, smart TVs now offer a far better quality of voice control and interaction than even a few years ago. That means you can search for movies, adjust the volume, or even check the weather and other mundane tasks, all with simple voice commands. AI-powered voice control allows hands-free operation and a more seamless TV experience. That means no more hunting down that lost remote or typing in long searches to get what you want. Instead, you can sit back, relax, and let your voice do all the work. TiVo's voice search goes even further, allowing you to search using quotes, songs, names, and more. If your smart TV's voice control is underwhelming, it could be a sign you need to upgrade your smart TV. Advanced Picture and Sound Optimization AI is pioneering the revolution of picture and sound quality on smart TVs. AI algorithms analyze room conditions, content type, and even viewer preferences to adjust brightness, contrast, and sound settings automatically for the best viewing experience possible. For example, Dolby’s Vision IQ uses AI to dynamically adjust picture settings based on the ambient light in the room, meaning that the viewer enjoys the best image quality, no matter what the lighting conditions are in the room. In the same vein, AI-based sound calibration technologies optimize audio settings in a way that delivers immersive and high-quality sound unique to your personal preferences. All without you really having to do a thing! Smart Home Integration Nowadays, smart TVs aren't just for watching your favorite shows; they’re increasingly becoming central hubs for controlling all your smart home devices. AI lets smart TVs seamlessly integrate with your web of smart home devices, meaning you can control lights, cameras, music, or thermostats right from your TV interface—nothing else is needed. Imagine being able to dim the lights, adjust the temperature, or even check who is at the front door without leaving the comfort of your couch. Sounds nice, especially if you are in the middle of a movie marathon! AI-Powered Accessibility Features Anindra Siqueira/MakeUseOf And finally, AI is playing a huge role in improving the accessibility features on smart TVs, making entertainment much more inclusive for just about everyone. As someone who pretty much always watches movies with subtitles on due to hearing loss, this is huge for me. Real-time captioning, audio descriptions, and gesture-based controls are just a few examples of how AI is making accessibility easier and more cost-effective for those running the show. As just one example, AI-powered speech-to-text technology is making real-time captioning more available, which benefits individuals with hearing impairments. For another, voice commands and gestures are making it easier to provide alternative input methods, catering to those users with mobility challenges. Both of these AI-driven accessibility features, among others, are transforming the way users with diverse needs interact with their smart TVs and, really, the world around them, making entertainment more inclusive and enjoyable for everyone. AI is quickly revolutionizing the capability and role of smart TVs in our lives, making them far more personalized, intuitive, and accessible. Our TVs are becoming ever more intelligent and adaptive to our needs, and we can only expect even more exciting advances in the future, further improving our entertainment experience!",
