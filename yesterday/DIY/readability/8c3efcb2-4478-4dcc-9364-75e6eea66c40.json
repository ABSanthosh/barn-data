With a bit of sanding, staining, and some TLC, these popular IKEA deck tiles can be brought back to former glory. A Reddit user recently shared their refresh project, and it really struck a chord with the IKEA hacker crowd. They simply sanded down the RUNNEN tiles, wiped them clean with white spirits, and applied two coats of wood stain — waiting a full 24 hours between coats. The results? Just like the day you installed them. We’ll break down exactly how to restore your IKEA RUNNEN wood tiles, tackle common concerns like mold and bugs, and give you tips for uneven surfaces and long-term durability. Let’s get into it — your patio makeover starts here. Step-by-Step: Refreshing IKEA RUNNEN Decking Tiles Like a Pro Runnen wooden tile refresh byu/fergohall inIKEA Redditor u/fergohall’s refresh method is solid and easy to follow: 1. Sanding: Start by lightly sanding the tiles. A palm sander makes this faster, but hand sanding works too. This helps strip old finish and smooth out weathered wood. 2. Cleaning: Wipe down the tiles with white spirits (aka mineral spirits). This removes dust and oils, prepping the wood for stain. 3. Staining: Apply your choice of wood stain — two coats, with 24 hours between each coat. Make sure the stain is for outdoor use. IKEA stocks a stain for wood, VÅRDA, for outdoor use. It’s a clear stain, so if you want to stain the deck tiles darker, go with a reputable brand like Behr, Ronseal, or Cabot for richer results. Pro Tip: Always test your stain on one tile before committing. Some woods absorb stain unevenly. Do IKEA RUNNEN Wood Tiles Hold Up Outdoors? RUNNEN Decking Tiles | Photo Credit: IKEA.com The short answer: They do, but it depends on the setup. Life_Bridge_9960 had some valid concerns about water pooling under the tiles, leading to mold, insects, and general yuckiness. And they’re not alone — several users mentioned stinkbug colonies and moisture buildup being issues.The honest truth? Anything sitting outside in damp conditions will attract bugs and mildew over time. RUNNEN tiles are no exception. If you’re facing mold and bug problems, try: Treating the wood with an anti-fungal outdoor stain Adding a weed barrier or moisture membrane underneath Lifting and clean the tiles every couple of months (or before winter) Using regular pest control spray if insects are a problem That said, others had great experiences, especially when tiles were used on covered balconies or patios. The key is ventilation underneath and regular maintenance. If your balcony is fully exposed, be ready to lift the IKEA decking tiles occasionally to remove dirt and leaves collected under them. Jet spray away any stains or mold from the floor. Consider adding a moisture barrier or slight drainage angle under your base layer to prevent water from pooling. Can You Use RUNNEN Floor Tiles on Uneven Surfaces? RUNNEN Decking Tiles | Photo Credit: IKEA.com RUNNEN tiles click together, so they need a reasonably flat surface. That said, they can flex a little. Some users have installed them on slightly sloped or uneven patios with success. Just know: Too much slope = gaps in your tile grid Uneven surfaces can cause tiles to shift or pop out Consider using rubber shims or leveling compound for major dips If your surface is very sloped, heavy outdoor tiles (like stone or ceramic) may be a better fit as those stay in place from weight alone. How Long Do Refreshed RUNNEN Decking Tiles Last? With proper care, you can expect your refreshed outdoor floor decking to last 2–3 years, especially in high-traffic or exposed areas. You can stretch that lifespan even further by: Reglazing them once or twice a year to protect against the elements and wear and tear Bringing the tiles indoors during winter Installing them on a covered porch or balcony The beauty of the IKEA RUNNEN is that even if a few tiles wear out, you can replace just those pieces without redoing the entire outdoor patio floor. FAQs: IKEA RUNNEN Wooden Deck Tiles Restoration 1. Can you re-stain IKEA RUNNEN tiles without sanding?You can, but sanding helps the new stain absorb better and prevents peeling. For best results, sand lightly before staining. 2. What’s the best stain for IKEA RUNNEN tiles?Outdoor wood stains like Behr Waterproofing Stain \u0026 Sealer or Ronseal Ultimate Protection work great. Choose one with UV and water resistance. 3. Can IKEA RUNNEN be used on dirt or grass?Not ideal. RUNNEN tiles need a stable, hard surface. Grass or soil can cause unevenness and accelerate wood rot underneath. 4. How often should I clean underneath the tiles?At least once per season. More if your area gets a lot of rain, bugs, or debris buildup. 5. Can I mix and match RUNNEN tile types (wood + plastic)?Yes! Many DIYers mix wood with plastic (like the gray polypropylene versions) for interesting patterns and better drainage. What’s Your Experience with RUNNEN Tiles?
