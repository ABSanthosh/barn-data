  "text": "There’s much more than music on Spotify. The streaming service continues to grow with audiobooks and podcasts. And a new update is making it even easier to see what you've been enjoying. Say Hello to the Recents Page The Recents page will show everything you have listened to in the last 90 days, including music, podcasts, and audiobooks. It will also show anything you’ve saved. Replacing the previous Listening History tab, it just takes a few taps to find Recents. After selecting your profile picture, you will then click Recents in the sidebar. Spotify also says the information will appear in the Home feed. Everything is listed in chronological order from the last 90 days. To better help you find something specific, you can filter by Music, Podcasts, or Audiobooks. It’s easy to pick something and start listening once again. The Recents page is available today on the Spotify iOS and Android app, but it may take time for you to see the feature. It’s also for both free and premium subscribers. There’s no word if the feature will roll out to the desktop version of Spotify. An Easy Way to Find a Forgotten Song The Recents page is something I’ve always wanted to see on Spotify. During the day, I often let music continue to play between different playlists. And I never seem to have time to look down at my iPhone and find out the title of the great song I listened to. I also save way too many albums and never seem to play them back later. It will be so nice to see what I listened to up to 90 days ago in just a few seconds. With Spotify’s continued growth, the company is taking time to improve all parts of the service. Last week, Spotify announced a number of new features being tested to improve the audiobook experience. Some of those include video clips for audiobooks and a Follow-Along experience that shows time-synchronized material while listening to a title. Spotify also recently announced a new audiobook deal that will add more than 1,000 titles for listeners.",
