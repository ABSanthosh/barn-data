  "text": "Google Search Sign in to your MUO account Google Google's use of artificial intelligence isn't going away. In fact, the company is expanding its use of AI by making it a more integral element of some of its biggest products. Which is why an AI Mode is coming to Google Search. Google's AI Mode Turns Searches Into Conversations The use of artificial intelligence is expanding at a rate of knots. The biggest tech companies in the world are keen not to be left behind here, so they're all fighting tooth and nail to incorporate AI into their products. And Google is no exception. As announced in a post on The Keyword, Google is launching a new AI Mode for Search. This is a new search option built on top of the existing AI Overviews that many of us will now see every time we type something into Google Search. Unless you disable AI Overviews by cursing. Google's AI Mode uses a custom version of Gemini 2.0 to offer \"more advanced reasoning, thinking and multimodal capabilities.\" It means that you can ask a question, and get an AI-powered response back. You can also ask follow-up questions, or more nuanced questions that the standard Google Search would struggle to cope with in a single query. As well as the new AI Mode, Google is also expanding its AI Overviews in several different ways... For starters, Gemini 2.0 will be handling AI Overviews, which means that it will be able to \"help with harder questions, starting with coding, advanced math and multimodal queries, with more on the way.\" AI Overviews will also be available to more people, including teenagers. You will also no longer need to be signed in to see AI Overviews in Google Search results. Related The Best Artificial Intelligence Clearly Won't Be Free Google's new AI Mode is only being made available to Google One AI Premium subscribers. Which means you'll need to pay Google a considerable monthly fee in order to gain access to this feature. At least for the time being. Google is being extremely cautious with AI Mode, so not only is it only being made available to Google One AI Premium users, it's being billed as an experiment in Google Labs. Still, Google clearly has high hopes for AI Mode, as it's the obvious next step to take in this direction. ChatGPT Search and Perplexity AI both offer similar tools already, so Google needed to follow suit or risk losing its dominant position in the space.",
