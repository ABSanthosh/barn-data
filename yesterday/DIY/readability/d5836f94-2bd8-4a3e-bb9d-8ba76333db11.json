A new scam is going around that claims that your home is in danger if you don't pay up. Fortunately, if you do receive this scam, you can safely disregard it. This New Google Maps Scam Threatens You for $2,000 As reported on Forbes, this new scam begins its life as a data leak. A scammer gathers information through data leaks to assemble your name, your email, and your address. Once they get their hands on these, they load up Google Maps and find your location. They then take a picture of your house, then send you an email with the image attached. The scammer will then invent a story about how you downloaded malware onto your PC. This malware began tracking your browsing habits, including any adult websites you may have visited. The scammer will then ask you to hand over $2,000 to keep this information secret, and if you don't pay up, they'll visit your residence to collect it. This is when they refer to the photo of your home to scare you into paying. Fortunately, if you do receive an email like this, the claims about the malware and the scammer visiting your house are all bunk. There was no malware, and the scammer will not visit your house—they may not even live in the same country as you. Feel free to delete the email, and remember; paying the scammer only encourages them to send more threats. Forbes also recommends that you blur your house on Google Maps. That way, if a scammer tries to use a photo of your home in a scam, all they'll get is a smudged mess.",

target=\"_blank\"\u003eForbes\u003c/a\u003e, this new scam begins its life as a data leak. A scammer gathers information through data leaks to assemble your name, your email, and your address. Once they get their hands on these, they load up Google Maps and find your location. They then take a picture of your house, then send you an email with the image attached.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe scammer will then invent a story about how you downloaded malware onto your PC. This malware began tracking your browsing habits, including any adult websites you may have visited. The scammer will then ask you to hand over $2,000 to keep this information secret, and if you don\u0026#39;t pay up, they\u0026#39;ll visit your residence to collect it. This is when they refer to the photo of your home to scare you into paying.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, if you do receive an email like this, the claims about the malware and the scammer visiting your house are all bunk. There was no malware, and the scammer will not visit your house—they may not even live in the same country as you. Feel free to delete the email, and remember; paying the scammer only encourages them to send more threats.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eForbes also recommends that you \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/blur-your-house-google/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblur your house on Google Maps\u003c/a\u003e.
