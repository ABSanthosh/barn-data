And what really surprised me was just how many unexpected accessories you can plug into your phone's tiny charging port—and have them actually work. 6 Mini Fan If you often find yourself stuck in a car with no A/C, waiting in line outside, or packed onto a bus, then a mini fan that plugs into your phone might be the refreshingly oddball solution you didn’t know you needed. These pocket-sized gadgets draw power directly from your phone’s USB-C port (or via an OTG adapter if needed), without requiring batteries. And don’t be fooled by their toy-like size. Many of these fans spin at surprisingly high speeds—some reaching up to 15,000 RPM to deliver a concentrated burst of cool air. Most are designed with soft, flexible blades for safety and easy transport, and they often come in fun colors that match the hot months well. Some even come in multipacks; perfect for keeping one in every bag or sharing with a friend who’s equally overheated. 5 Thermal Imaging Camera Thought that thermal cameras were just for ghost hunters or science fiction props? Not so! These little plug-ins can give your smartphone a whole new way to see the world: through heat. Whether you're chasing down a sneaky draft, checking for a busted pipe, or just curious what your cat’s up to when the lights go out, these devices translate invisible heat signatures into vivid, colorful images right on your screen. James Bruce / MakeUseOf Models like the Xinfrared X2 (which we reviewed favorably), the FLIR ONE (compatible with recent iPhones), or the Finder S1 (for Android) pack some serious tech into a tiny shell. They connect via USB-C and most include helpful companion apps that guide you through tasks like checking HVAC systems, finding hidden cameras in a room, or spotting overloaded outlets. You don’t need to be an electrician or contractor to make the most of one. If you're a hands-on type or always curious, this is a clever way to upgrade your phone into a tool worthy of a science fair ribbon. 4 Crypto Wallet Dongles If you're into crypto and serious about the safety of your ownings, you might be interested in hardware wallet dongles that connect directly to your phone’s charging port. They may look like simple USB sticks, but they act as encrypted vaults for your digital assets. Once plugged in, they allow you to approve transactions, monitor balances, and manage your holdings without ever exposing your private keys to the internet. BestCryptoCodes/Flickr Unlike software wallets or exchange-based storage (which are more vulnerable to hacks and phishing), hardware wallets from brands like Ledger and Trezor keep your keys securely offline. Your phone simply provides the interface, while the real protection happens inside the hardware. Even if your phone gets compromised, your crypto stays safe. 3 Digital Microscope Microscopes used to be relegated to science labs and high school biology classes, but now, all you need is your phone and a steady hand. Plug a digital microscope (like this one from Teslong) into your phone’s USB-C port, and you get a portable lab in your pocket. With magnification ranges often stretching from 10X to 200X, you can use it to explore an astonishing level of detail—whether it’s the surface of a coin, the wings of a bug, the weave of a fabric, or the micro-soldering on a circuit board. Most models stream a live feed directly to your phone via a companion app, complete with adjustable LED lighting to illuminate your subject. Many also include rotating stands or handheld grips to help you examine flat and uneven surfaces with ease. Some versions even come with oddly specific attachments for more specialized tasks, like skin and ear inspections, or tiny mirrors for peeking into tight spots (hello, keyboard crumbs). 2 Drone Controller In case you haven't seen this in action already: yes, your smartphone can double as a full-featured drone cockpit. Many drone controllers are designed to plug directly into your phone’s USB-C or Lightning port. Once connected, your phone displays a real-time first-person view from the drone’s camera along with flight data, battery levels, and GPS mapping—all within an app-driven interface. Just be sure to charge your phone beforehand, as you definitely don't want your command center powering down mid-flight. Most of these controllers are foldable and travel-friendly, and they play especially well with drones like DJI’s Mini series. 1 Phone Docking Station A phone docking station is designed to charge your smartphone while keeping it upright and easily accessible. Unlike a basic charger, it usually acts as a stand or cradle, connecting via the charging port or a cable. This makes it ideal for hands-free tasks like video calls, media playback, or simply keeping notifications visible at a glance. Bertel King / MakeUseOf But where docking stations really shine (and what makes this something you might not have known about) is in turning your phone into a makeshift desktop setup. With the right dock, you can connect your phone to an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse to get real work done. Take the JSAUX USB-C Docking Station, for example. It offers 8-in-1 functionality, including HDMI output and multiple USB ports, as well as supporting features like Samsung DeX for a desktop-like experience. Related I Work Entirely From My Phone, and I'm More Productive Than Ever What started as an experiment has changed the way I get stuff done. Modern phones are now essentially pocket computers with expandable functionality. As manufacturers continue to standardize around USB-C, we're likely to see even more innovative accessories that blur the line between mobile devices and professional equipment.",
