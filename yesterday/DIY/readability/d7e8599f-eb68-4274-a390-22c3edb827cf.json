I've found nine ways you can turn your Raspberry Pi into a homemade laptop. 1. CrowView Note Raspberry Pi Laptop Kit The CrowView Note is an amazing all-in-one laptop featuring the latest Raspberry Pi models. There are many reasons to upgrade to a Raspberry Pi 5, but taking full advantage of the CrowView Note is high on my list. This laptop is the newest release from the makers of the CrowPi and CrowPi2, and it’s their thinnest and lightest design yet. In many ways, the CrowView Note matches the experience of using a full-fledged laptop—except that you can dock and undock your Pi at a moment’s notice. The screen is a full 14-inch IPS display at 1080p resolution, and the large 5000mAh battery will let you stay on the go for longer. This laptop even sports USB-C and USB-A ports on the side so you can connect your smartphone or other peripherals. Supported Models: Raspberry Pi 5, Pi 4B, Pi Zero 2W (As with all the options on this list, you should check which Raspberry Pi model you have to make sure that everything is compatible.) 2. Piper Raspberry Pi Laptop Computer A portable Raspberry Pi kit that focuses on electronics and programming, the Piper comes with a self-assembly wooden case. There's a non-touch display, loudspeaker, and compartment for the Raspberry Pi and a breadboard. All the wires, LEDs, and switches you could need are also included. The kit also includes a rechargeable power supply, making it truly portable. While the addition of a compact keyboard lets you use the Piper for standard Raspberry Pi-based productivity tasks, it’s the dedicated version of Minecraft-Pi that sets this kit apart. Not a standard Raspberry Pi laptop, the Piper is a useful educational tool that can go anywhere. Supported Models: Raspberry Pi 4B, Pi 3B+ 3. Raspberry Pi and Arduino Laptop With a full keyboard, DIY trackpad, and 7-inch display, this DIY build will result in your own Raspberry Pi laptop. This project uses a Raspberry Pi 3, but you could easily swap this with a Raspberry Pi Model 3B+. A detailed video (above) accompanies this build. You'll learn how to build the battery pack, connect a charger and boost converter, and even extend a USB port to improve accessibility. The Arduino component, meanwhile, displays a status for the battery charge and provides connectivity for sensor modules. It's a useful all-in-one approach! With a keyboard from a 7-inch tablet case, this Raspberry Pi laptop is built from reinforced cardboard. Supported Models: Raspberry Pi 3 4. CrowPi 2 Raspberry Pi Laptop A chunky laptop chassis with space for a Raspberry Pi 4 (a 4GB model is included), the CrowPi 2 is a superb kit. Shipping with a power supply, dual game controllers, an integrated electronics workshop board, and a bunch of components for STEM development, the CrowPi 2 is a bit of a hobbyist's dream. The integrated electronics workshop board alone is enough to keep you going, while the \"loose\" components—many of which can be breadboarded in the workshop—can help you push your learning further. Overall, this is a great Raspberry Pi laptop kit with a heavy focus on learning, and we thought it was great in our hands-on CrowPi 2 review. Related: CrowPi 2 Raspberry Pi Workshop Review Supported Models: Raspberry Pi 4B 5. DIY Raspberry Pi Pocket Laptop Using a keyboard, IPS display, portable battery recharger, and a Raspberry Pi 3, this laptop seems simpler than it is. A switch is attached to the battery, enabling easy switch on. Perhaps the most interesting thing about this build, however, is the plastic chassis. While it doesn't have space for the chosen Bluetooth keyboard (others may be more suitable), it's a surprisingly perfect fit. What's particularly interesting about this project is that it is pretty barebones. Only the absolute basics are included here, which allows you to customize the rest by adding your own twist. There's no link for this Raspberry Pi laptop project—everything you need is in the video. Supported Models: Raspberry Pi 3 6. LapPi 2.0 DIY Raspberry Pi Laptop A DIY acrylic laptop for the Raspberry Pi, the LapPi 2.0 comes with a 7-inch capacitive touchscreen. Furthermore, you can buy the kit unassembled or pre-assembled, although you’ll have to supply the Raspberry Pi yourself. Luckily, the LapPi is compatible with any consumer model of Raspberry Pi you can think of. There's also a keyboard, camera, Li-Ion rechargeable power bank, and speakers. Five colors are available: red, blue, yellow, black, and clear. As the kit is particularly small, the LapPi isn't a typical productivity laptop. It is, however, designed to help you turn your Raspberry Pi into a great mini laptop. Supported Models: Raspberry Pi 5, Pi 4B, Pi 3, Pi 2, Pi 1, Pi Zero 2W, Pi Zero 7. DIY 3D-Printed Raspberry Pi Laptop projectupton / Instructables What could be more DIY than a 3D-printed laptop powered by a Raspberry Pi? Featuring a Raspberry Pi 2 and a 3.5-inch TFT display, this build employs a miniature Bluetooth keyboard. There's also a Li-Ion battery, and Wi-Fi dongle, but with more recent Raspberry Pi models, this wouldn't be required. Everything about this build is small, resulting in a pocket-sized Raspberry Pi laptop. While closer in size to a smartphone than a netbook, the choice of keyboard makes this build easy to use. A 3D-printed frame houses the keyboard, screen, and Raspberry Pi, while 3D-printed hinges hold the two halves together. Need to make your Raspberry Pi portable? If you want to 3D print your solution, this is the way to go. Find the full instructions in the project’s Instructables page. Supported Models: Raspberry Pi 2B 8. Nano Pi2 UMPC Mini Raspberry Pi Computer Are you looking for a DIY Raspberry Pi laptop that you can slip into your pocket? This minicomputer combines a Raspberry Pi 2, display, keyboard, Adafruit Powerboost 1000, a battery, and 3D printing to achieve the smallest Raspberry Pi-powered system yet. Once assembled, the Pi 2 lives under the keyboard, and the whole unit folds up, just like a full-sized keyboard. While the 4-inch LCD is compact, if you need a Pi in your pocket for easy access, this is ideal. It’s a great DIY project idea for putting an old Raspberry Pi to use. All the details and 3D printing templates you need can be found on the Nano Pi2’s Thingiverse project page. Supported Models: Raspberry Pi 2 9. Lego Raspberry PiBook Laptop Peter Howkins/Marutan.NET Finally, a Raspberry Pi laptop project that anyone can build—providing you've plenty of plastic bricks from Lego. Developed by Peter Howkins, the Lego Raspberry PiBook has USB port access, and a door to change the microSD card. It consists of standard bricks and Technic pieces and is built on two 16x24 stud Lego baseplates. Head over to Peter’s website to learn more and start building your own. Supported Models: Raspberry Pi 1B With a Raspberry Pi-powered laptop, not only do you have a portable computer you can use for productivity, but you can use it for coding projects, too. Just imagine the possibilities.",
