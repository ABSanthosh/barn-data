Most of the time, custom built-ins end up costing thousands and thousands of dollars, putting them out of reach for many. So I get why a DIY showcasing how to elevate IKEA’s BILLY bookcases into a cool plaster shelf unit would have over 60,000 likes. The BILLY is one of IKEA’s most popular products, and it’s featured in countless hacks thanks to its versatility. This hack from Nora Dumoulin @noracontetout showcases an intense DIY project that transforms three BILLY bookcases into a custom built-in. The finished project boasts a modern style with a bit of Mediterranean influence from the plaster effect. I think this DIY takes commitment, so I wouldn’t dive in without proper planning and scheduling. I also would definitely have a partner help out like the original hacker did. What You’ll Need 3 IKEA BILLY bookcases 3 BILLY height extensions 90 Wooden boards Leveling paste (make sure it works with all surfaces) Spray plaster (suitable for indoors) White paint Screws Wall support hardware Screwgun Drill Multitool Circular saw Flat wood drill bit (depending on the diameter of the hinges) Mix Knife and trowel (for applying plaster and coating) Sandpaper (various grits) Paintbrush and roller 3 Furniture panels to match the BILLY color (approx. 98” x 15”) *for the doors 12 Invisible hinges (¼” and 110-degree) *for the doors Bringing the BILLY Plaster Display Shelf to Life 1. Assemble the BILLYS First, assemble the bookcases and height extensions according to IKEA’s instructions. The BILLY bookcase unit requires a minimum height of 80 ¾” and the extension adds another 14 inches. Attach the extensions to the bookcases, and secure everything to the wall with appropriate supports. 2. Cut and Install Niches Set aside the necessary shelves that come with the BILLY bookcases for the closed storage. Cut the leftovers to create the niches. If you need extra wood, use the same thickness as the BILLY shelves. Screw the niches into place from the top and bottom. (You’ll be covering the screws with the leveling compound.) 3. Make the Doors Measure and cut the furniture panels to make the doors. Install the invisible hinges. Sand the door fronts to create a better bonding surface for the leveling paste. The spatula leaves deliberate strokes, but you could opt for a smoother finish. Nora opted to make doors to save money. But she offers, “If you want to save yourself the trouble, opt for OXBERG doors designed for BILLY furniture.”  4. Create the Curves The creator rounded the outer edges with something similar to this multitool from Bosch. Sand the whole unit with coarse grit sandpaper, apply the leveling paste, and use plaster to create the rounds. The creator recommends, “putting a lot of material in the corners,” and creating “the rounded shape using the spatula and the trowel. You can also use a bottle or a glass to give the rounded shape.” After everything dries, use the filler to do touch-ups on small holes and cracks. Then, sand everything. 5. Prep and Paint Dust the entire unit to create a clean surface, then paint. Decorate as desired. Will This Hack Stand the Test of Time? Honestly, only time will tell. The DIY appears beyond beginner and takes some time to complete. Nora tells one commenter, “I wouldn’t say it’s difficult but rather be willing to invest time and energy. Steps are not complicated but can be tedious.” That being said, some people didn’t like the effect on the doors, even the original creator said after 1 ½ years they were considering changing them. Others worried about the material holding up over time, especially after all of the work and effort that went into the process. Anthony (@antho.fav86) said, “The furniture won’t hold for long, plaster on wooden boards. It’s going to crack sooner or later. For the curves, you should have made a right angle template to get a professional look, rather than doing it with a spatula + trowel.” The creator responded, “So far, one year and everything is ok, but otherwise, for the round ones, we were looking for an irregular effect so we love it like that.” Others wondered if using real boards would have been better for longevity after all that effort. The primary reason the hacker went the route they did was admittedly price. What do you think? Is this hack worth a try, or would you do something differently?",
