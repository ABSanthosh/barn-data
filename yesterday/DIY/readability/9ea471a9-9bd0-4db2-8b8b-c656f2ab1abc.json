We’re living that air fryer lifestyle for the foreseeable future. It definitely makes me thankful for modern conveniences I typically take for granted. 10 Things I Love 1. For reading this week I’m finishing up By Any Other Name and absolutely loving it. Next up on my list is The Talented Mr. Ripley. I always love hearing your book suggestions so tell me what’s the best thing you’ve read recently? Emma told me The Wedding People is incredible. 2. For surviving our kitchen renovation I am loving my Wonder Oven. I’ve heard it referred to as an “adult easy-bake oven” and I couldn’t agree more. 3. We’re planning our first overseas trip with the girls later this month and I’m so excited for them to see their first concert Sleeping At Last. What a special memory, right? I’d love to hear your kid-friendly London recommedations. 4. I’ve been spending a ton of time creating recently including taking art lessons and lots of writing courses. If you are on a similar journey I highly recommend The Artist’s Way. I’ve read it in the past but I’ve never followed the program week by week and it’s life changing. 5. It’s funny how when renovating a home I end up spending so much time trying to find the prettiest toilet paper storage. I can’t wait to show you our daughter’s new mermaid bathroom- it has a pink toilet. 6. I just found my new summer perfume. It’s light, warm and smells so good. 7. My husband and I are rewatching The Sopranos and I’m blown away how well it holds up and also how much the world has changed in the past twenty years. I’d love to hear what television and movies you’re enjoying lately. 8. I think I need this t-shirt (Etsy forever!). 9. I just replaced my Canon large format printer. I’m a loyalist. I use it for printing both everyday documents and photos. For large format photos I use the luster photo paper. The quality is a 10/10. 10. If you don’t subscribe to Sharon McMahon’s substack, The Preamble, I highly recommend it. This article brought so many feelings to the surface (ouch- my heart!). I also love being a part of her book club. Recent Blog Posts Learn to make Butter Chicken. Try Emma’s Chow Mein recipe. The secret to Ombre Nails. Homemade Chimichangas",
