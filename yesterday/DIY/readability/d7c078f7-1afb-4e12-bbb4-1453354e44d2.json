All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 afterCreating a bedroom you love to be in is not always an easy task. “This room was very boring, bland, and blue,” says homeowner Jen Crutcher (@crutcherhouse). Still, she knew the primary bedroom in her new home had potential. “It needed some design and DIY,” Jen says. Not everything about this room was a negative for Jen. “I loved the size, layout, and the cove ceiling, but everything else had to go,” she says. When Jen and her husband, Damon, moved to Kansas for Damon to start law school, she knew she wanted to create an oasis. “I wanted our bedroom to be one of the first projects,” Jen says. “I knew we needed a space to relax at the night’s end as I’m DIYing the rest of the house,” she adds.Make a big difference with a wall treatment.“I started this project by adding picture frame molding, which immediately enhanced the room,” Jen says. “[It’s] a budget-friendly DIY that makes a huge impact,” she says.Jen also ripped out her old baseboards and installed Hewn Floor Stoneform flooring in the color Bare from the Becki Owens’ collection, which was gifted from the brand. “I was able to float the new floors over the existing flooring,” she says. Jen added new baseboards, and then it was time to paint.“[I] color-drenched the entire room in Sherwin-Williams’ Clove,” Jen says. Rather than brushes or rollers, Jen used a new tool for the paint. “This was my first time using a paint sprayer rather than rolling it, and it was a game-changer!” she says. With the help of her friend Chris, Jen applied the paint on the wall molding and ceiling.“Painting with the sprayer was definitely way easier than I thought it would be,” she says. And Jen loves the result. “The picture frame molding and dark chocolate brown make it feel so warm and luxurious,” she says. Pivoting to a great new design.“The biggest setback for this project was the ceiling treatment,” Jen says. She originally planned to create a tongue-and-groove wood ceiling, but she had to shift gears when she unexpectedly couldn’t transport the supplies she needed. “I tried to shift gears by buying peel-and-stick flooring and applying that as a ceiling treatment,” Jen says. However, that didn’t really work out. “It was ugly, did not stick, and just a complete fail,” she says.But she got it right on the third try. “I regrouped and borrowed a friend’s truck to get some shiplap,” Jen says. “It was the perfect finishing touch to the room, and I’m so happy with how it turned out,” she adds.Jen contrasted the black ceiling with a white Hunter fan that was gifted to her from the company.Add the perfect finishing touches.“I love absolutely everything about the after!” she says. “This room is a moody and relaxing retreat, and I feel comforted when walking in it,” Jen explains.She also achieved her goal to create a relaxing space. “I’m so proud of how this room turned out, and I’m so happy I have a nice escape from the rest of my DIY projects,” Jen says.",
