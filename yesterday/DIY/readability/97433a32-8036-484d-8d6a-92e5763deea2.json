  "text": "The ability to text using a satellite instead of a cellular or Wi-Fi network continues to be a popular feature on new iPhone and Android models. But a new device from HMD, unveiled at CES, brings satellite texting to pretty much any phone or tablet. Connectivity and Location Sharing The HMD OffGrid is designed to provide satellite communication to any iOS or Android device using a companion app. You can communicate and share your live location with five others with the app. Weighing a little more than 2 ounces, the device can go for up to three days of use on a single charge. The dongle is IP68 weatherproof as well. Press the SOS button on the device to activate the included Overwatch x Rescue service that provides emergency response, search-and-rescue, and more. You can purchase the HMD OffGrid now in the United States, Europe, and Australia/New Zealand for $199.99. It will arrive in other territories throughout the year. There are two subscription options available. HMD Freedom is $79.99 per year with a $19.99 one-time activation fee. You can use up to 350 text and check-in messages. With the HMD Unlimited option, available for $139.99 per year with a $9.99 one-time activation fee, you’ll receive unlimited text and check-in messages. Both subscriptions can optionally add unlimited live tracking for an additional $4.99 monthly. That can be activated or deactivated at any time. A minimum 12-month subscription is required. Always Stay in Touch While you’ll have to pay for the device and a subscription, the OffGrid looks like a nice option for outdoor explorers without a phone sporting native satellite capability. Satellite connections work differently than a traditional cell signal. Most importantly, you will have to be outside and in the line of sight to a satellite. Back in November, the FCC announced that it granted SpaceX the ability to provide direct-to-cell coverage for T-Mobile. Satellite texting will likely arrive sometime this year. Apple is also reportedly expanding satellite communication to another popular device. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 will apparently arrive this year with the ability to send text messages via satellite.",
