  "text": "ChatGPT Sign in to your MUO account It's the moment ChatGPT Plus subscribers have been waiting for: you can now use OpenAI's deep research tool as part of your monthly fee. OpenAI Rolls Out Deep Research to ChatGPT Plus Subscribers Previously limited to ChatGPT's $200 Professional subscription tier, Plus subscribers can now use the AI tool to create incredibly in-depth reports on almost any topic. The deep research rollout is starting from 25 February 2025, as posted on OpenAI's X account. ChatGPT Plus subscribers have a limit of ten deep research queries per month, though that figure is likely to rise in the future. When OpenAI first launched deep research, it noted the process was \"currently very compute intensive.\" As the company scales up its deep research feature, the number of uses will also rise—though there is currently nothing on the cards for ChatGPT's enormous number of free users. ChatGPT Professional subscribers also receive a bump in the number of deep research queries, rising to 120 from 100. ChatGPT's deep research tool is designed to autonomously analyze information from a wide range of sources and compile a report on its findings. It can scour the internet and find data, analyzing thousands of different sources to create unique research documents. This, in a fraction of the time it would take a human. ChatGPT's deep research tool can take anywhere from five minutes to a full hour (or more in some cases) to complete a report, depending on its complexity. The tool shows its workings and processes in a side panel while compiling the report, illustrating exactly what it is currently analyzing. As part of the deep research rollout to ChatGPT Plus subscribers, OpenAI has delivered some additional updates to the tool. Deep research can now embed images with citations in a report and is better at analyzing and referencing user-uploaded files. However, ChatGPT's deep research feature isn't the same as ChatGPT Operator, it's autonomous AI agent that can contact businesses, make reservations, and more. Deep research is just as it sounds: it's all about making reports. How to Try ChatGPT Deep Research OpenAI is rolling out deep research to ChatGPT Plus subscribers as of this writing, and it should appear on your account any day soon. All ChatGPT feature updates take a little while to filter out to every account, so if you don't see the \"deep research\" AI model yet (in the ChatGPT AI model picker), you'll have to be patient a little while longer—like me!",

rise—though there is currently nothing on the cards for ChatGPT\u0026#39;s enormous number of free users.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eChatGPT Professional subscribers also receive a bump in the

The tool shows its workings and processes in a side panel while compiling the report, illustrating exactly what it is currently analyzing.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAs part of the deep research rollout to ChatGPT Plus subscribers, OpenAI has delivered some additional updates to the tool.
