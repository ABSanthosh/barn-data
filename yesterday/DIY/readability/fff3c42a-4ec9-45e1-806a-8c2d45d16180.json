Palestinian DIY enthusiast Qamar Derbas (@decorista_93) had the same thought – and turned it into a brilliant pantry storage solution. Her clever IKEA hack transforms the IKEA GERSBY bookshelf into a rolling pull-out pantry that slides perfectly into that refrigerator gap. This project requires no special tools or much DIY expertise and takes a mere hour or two hour to complete. What’s more, the GERSBY bookshelf costs only $50 and looks terribly boring, which are two solid reasons to hack it.Here’s how to recreate this space-maximizing storage solution. What You’ll Need IKEA GERSBY bookshelf 2 extendable washing machine rolling bases (Ensure the rolling bases are rated for adequate weight capacity) Cabinet handle Drill and drill bit Pull-Out Pantry For Refrigerator Gap 1. Assemble the Bookshelf Start by putting together your GERSBY bookshelf according to IKEA instructions. This slim bookcase is perfect for narrow spaces, measuring just 23 5/8″ wide and 9 1/2″ deep. If you have a wider gap, the BILLY bookcase is also a good candidate for this hack. 2. Add Mobility Place two washing machine rolling bases under the assembled bookshelf. Position one at the front and one at the back of the bookshelf. You don’t need to attach the rollers to the bookcase. The metal stoppers on the edge of the rollers and non-slip pads will help the bookcase stay on the bases. Opt for lockable rollers to ensure your pantry stays securely in place, especially when you want to load and unload the shelves. 3. Attach the Handle Add a cabinet handle to the outer side of the bookcase. This will make it easy to pull the unit out when you need to access your items. Qamar offers a quick tip for precise installation of the handle. Start by using a piece of masking tape to mark the screw holes on the handle. Once marked, transfer the tape to the side of the bookshelf. Drill through the marked points, and then secure the handle by screwing it in from behind the bookshelf. 4. Load up the Pull-Out Pantry Always keep heavier items on lower shelves for better stability. We also recommend adding non-slip shelf liners to prevent items from sliding. And that’s it! Have fun organizing your pantry. Personalization Ideas To Make It Your Own Transform this basic hack into a custom storage solution that matches your style and needs: Match Your Vibe Paint the bookshelf to match your kitchen color scheme Add trim and molding the the side of the bookshelf (the panel which faces front, next to your refrigerator) to match your kitchen cabinets Apply peel-and-stick wallpaper to the frame and back panel to upgrade the basic IKEA white foil Add motion-sensor battery-powered lights to automatically light up the cabinet when you roll it out Install a magnetic whiteboard on one side for shopping lists Tweak The Storage Use clear acrylic organizers shelf for spice storage Add wooden dowels above the shelves as guard rails to stop bottles and cans from falling off when the pantry is rolled out. For an easier hack, use tension rods installed horizontally. Add tension rods (vertically) to create divided sections for storing baking sheets and cutting boards Install small hooks on the sides for hanging cooking utensils or dish towels Use stackable clear containers to maximize vertical space on each shelf Add cork strips to the back panel for pinning recipes or notes Use This Around The Home While this hack was originally designed for kitchen storage, its versatility makes it perfect for any narrow space in your home. We see this creative solution working in different rooms throughout the house. In The Laundry Room The laundry room often has those challenging gaps between appliances and walls that seem impossible to utilize effectively. A rolling GERSBY unit fits perfectly in these spaces, creating an ideal home for detergents, fabric softeners, and stain removers.Keep your ironing supplies, mesh bags, and dryer balls organized and within arm’s reach. The vertical storage is particularly useful for storing those often-forgotten but essential items like clothing care guides and spare cleaning supplies, making laundry day more efficient and organized. In The Craft Room Place a rolling bookshelf between crafting tables or existing shelving to create practical storage for jars of paints, art supplies, tools, and works in progress. The mobility factor is particularly helpful during project work, as you can roll your supplies right to where you need them, then tuck them away when you’re done. Add a row of two or three rolling bookcases and you can create significant storage space while occupying a minimal footprint. So don’t be quick to give up on small nooks and crannies in your home. You can easily turn them into functional storage areas. Let us know in the comments below how you have maximized storage in small, challenging spaces. Or, have you completed an IKEA hack of your own?
