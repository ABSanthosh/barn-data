All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 afterThis time around, she worked with a client, Rachel Murray, on a Victorian-inspired bedroom makeover. The room had good bones — original timber sash windows, plenty of natural light, and 10-foot ceilings — but it “lacked any excitement or warmth in the palette,” Nina says. Rachel wanted “a vintage eclectic vibe, to reflect her bold, vibrant personality,” Nina adds.Color drenching the bedroom added drama. The transformation didn’t require any major demo besides taking out a built-in closet. The biggest difference-maker in the room was the head-to-toe blue paint (Farrow \u0026 Ball’s Hague Blue) — and Nina said it almost didn’t happen. The pro painter hired to paint the room was hesitant about painting the sash window trim and almost talked them out of it, but Nina held firm. “This room wouldn’t have had the same impact, wouldn’t have been elevated, if the sash window had remained white!” Nina says. She also says painting the radiator the same dramatic blue instead of replacing it with a cast-iron one saved money. The all-over paint truly gives the room a maximalist effect.Two other window upgrades Nina loves? “Removing the blinds that let in so much light, and installing antique curtains transformed the room,” she says. (Plus, the new curtains are sunlight-blocking, which helps Rachel get better sleep — one of her “musts” for the new space.)The bedroom is furnished with antiques.After the painting, Nina helped source statement pieces “to pop against this backdrop, to bring warmth, pattern, and a soft sumptuousness to the room,” she says. She went with mostly warm tones and added antique silk damask curtains (originally from a French chateau), a brass bed from the 1930s, a mid-century chandelier, and Art Deco walnut furniture.Nina’s advice is to find antiques when you can, especially if you can snag them for a bargain price. “They’re really good quality, built to last,” she says. If a bed is already 100 years old and still in good condition, it’ll last another 100 years at least!”Mostly, she recommends choosing items you’re in love with, down to every detail. “Everything you touch has the power to lift, so look closely at the details,” she says. “If you’re renovating your bedroom, what you see will be the first and last thing you see each day. If you love it, it’ll be worth the extra cost.”She loves the way the deep color drench, textures, and patterns came together in this bedroom — as does Rachel!",
