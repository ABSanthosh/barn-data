  "text": "Summary Fanatical's Mystery Egg Bundle gives you a chance to score 500 games for $1 each or less, including AAA titles or hardware. Each \"egg\" in the Mystery Egg Bundle guarantees a different game. Redeem your codes on Steam to access games or trade and gift them out if you don't want them. For the rest of May, Fanatical is offering a special bundle that will allow you to buy dozens of random games for as little as $1. Not only is this the cheapest you can get almost any game, but you may also be able to score VR headsets, a Steam Deck, or AAA titles for that price. Fanatical's Mystery Egg Bundle Fanatical is an official online game retailer that sells legitimate digital game keys, having sold more than 80 million games to over two million customers. A digital key is a special code that allows you to officially download a game and play it. The process is a little different, but it's no different than buying a digital game directly from any storefront like Epic Games or Steam. Buying a legitimate key is buying a copy of the game that is officially recognized by all. Fanatical has been selling digital game keys for a long time, and they're almost always offering special bundles focusing on a certain genre of games or particular series. However, one of the most interesting offers available right now is their Mystery Egg Bundle, which comes around every year. For a little under the next three weeks, customers will be able to buy random Steam game keys for just $1. If you buy more than one digital key at a time, you can get even greater discounts. For example, you can buy 15 game keys for about $11, and 25 game keys for just $16. As for what you can get, each \"egg\" you buy can be any game of the 500 covered by the offer. It could be an indie game you've never heard of or a major AAA title like Oblivion Remastered or Monster Hunter Wilds. You can also get other prizes, like the Quest 3 VR headset or a Steam Deck 1TB. Tim Brookes / How-To Geek Now, I'll admit that this is pretty much just a loot box system. You spend money not knowing what you are going to get, and you might not be happy with the result. But it's not like a loot box system where 90% of what you get is crap or something you already had. If you buy a bundle, every item you receive will be different. If you buy 25 \"eggs\" in one order, you will get 25 different games, guaranteed. However, it is possible to get a duplicate if you purchase a separate second order. What Games Are You Likely to Get? There are around 500 games that can potentially drop from each \"egg\" you buy in this bundle. So really, you could get anything. As far as I know, there are no gacha-style drop rates like a normal loot box system, though we can't say for sure how the egg system works. The AAA game titles may be weighted differently than the less popular titles, but there's no evidence for or against that. Still, for the sake of transparency and giving you a good idea of what you might be able to expect, I purchased a 25 \"egg\" bundle myself. Here's a full list of all the games I got for just $16: King's Bounty: Platinum Edition King of Dragon Pass Dead Age Unsouled Time Rift Beyond a Steel Sky Degrees of Separation Banner of the Maid Peachleaf Pirates Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot: The First Cases XIII - Classic Hammerwatch Anniversary Edition Coromon Onde Catnight Terror of Hemasaurus Odysseus Cosmos and His Robot Quest Slime-san You Suck at Parking Complete Edition Arcade Paradise Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX Anvil Saga FootLol: Epic Soccer League The Ascent Ziggurat As you can see, I didn't get any $60-$70 AAA title in my bundle, which was a bit of a bummer. And I'm going to level with youâ€”out of these 25 games, I've only even heard of, like, 5 of them. That said, this is still 25 games for just $16. Ziggurat alone would have cost me $15 to buy directly through Steam. And if I had bought all 25 of these games directly through Steam? That would have cost me $388. I spent $16 to get $388 worth of games. Are all of those games good? Are they all the types of games I enjoy? Will I even play half of them? When I purchased this bundle, I was really hoping for Oblivion Remastered, which I obviously didn't get. But I cannot be upset about this, considering I basically got a whopping 96% discount on these 25 games. It's not like these are all \"no-name\" games, either. Sure, none of them are AAA titles from a huge studio, but games like The Ascent and Beyond a Steel Sky have been critically acclaimed and are worth far more than the, ultimately, less than $1 I paid for them. Heck, those two games alone were both $30 or more on Steam. So, I can't promise that you'll get exactly what you want from this Fanatical offer. But the odds of you getting a really good deal for your money are pretty high. Even if the 25 games you got were all $1 on Steam, you'd still be getting a pretty big discount. If you're the type of gamer that floats from game to game and is constantly looking for something new to play, or just want to discover indie titles that may have eluded you otherwise, this bundle is a great offer. How to Redeem Your Digital Game Keys From Fanatical If you've never bought a game through a digital key before, you may be wondering how to redeem a game key on Steam. Don't worry, it's not complicated in the slightest. You will have to make an account with Fanatical to even purchase a mystery egg bundle, but making an account in and of itself is free. When you make your purchase on the Fanatical website, you'll get a list of all the games you got from your eggs. A key will be provided, which is just a 15-digit code you can redeem directly on Steam. Copy that code and open your Steam client. Go to the top left corner and click on \"Games.\" This will open a drop-down menu. Then, click \"Activate a product on Steam.\" This will open up a window where you can paste your digital game key. Click \"Confirm\" when you've copied it over. Congratulations, your new game is now officially part of your Steam library, and you can download it to play at any time. There's nothing else you have to do. Granted, you'll need to do this for each individual game, but it's a quick process. Now, it's worth noting that you don't actually \"own\" the game until you've redeemed your digital game key. This means you can actually give or sell that key to someone else if you don't want the game yourself. You can sell digital game keys on many platforms, or simply give the code to your friend so they can download the game instead. In some ways, this makes the mystery egg bundle even better, as you're not \"stuck\" with all the games you get. You may be able to recoup your losses or at least make a gift out of them. I know a lot of gamers don't like microtransactions or \"loot boxes,\" and in a way, the mystery egg bundle from Fanatical is a loot box. But it feels like an offer that is in your favor, with pretty much no conceivable way for your money to get you something less than what it's worth. You can even sell, trade, or give away those codes if you want.",

That would have cost me $388. I spent $16 to get $388 worth of games. Are all of those games good? Are they all the types of games I enjoy? Will I even play half of them? When I purchased this bundle, I was really hoping for \u003cem\u003eOblivion Remastered, \u003c/em\u003ewhich I obviously didn\u0026#39;t get. But I cannot be upset about this, considering I basically got a whopping 96% discount on these 25 games.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s not like these are all \u0026#34;no-name\u0026#34; games, either. Sure, none of them are AAA titles from a huge studio, but games like \u003cem\u003eThe Ascent\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eBeyond a Steel Sky \u003c/em\u003ehave been critically acclaimed and are worth far more than the, ultimately, less than $1 I paid for them. Heck, those two games alone were both $30 or more on Steam.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSo, I can\u0026#39;t promise that you\u0026#39;ll get exactly what you want from this Fanatical offer.

Go to the top left corner and click on \u0026#34;Games.\u0026#34; This will open a drop-down menu. Then, click \u0026#34;Activate a product on Steam.\u0026#34; This will open up a window where you can paste your digital game key.

This means you can actually give or sell that key to someone else if you don\u0026#39;t want the game yourself. You can sell digital game keys on many platforms, or simply give the code to your friend so they can download the game instead. In some ways, this makes the mystery egg bundle even better, as you\u0026#39;re not \u0026#34;stuck\u0026#34; with all the games you get.

But it feels like an offer that is in your favor, with pretty much no conceivable way for your money to get you something less than what it\u0026#39;s worth. You can even sell, trade, or give away those codes if you want.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
