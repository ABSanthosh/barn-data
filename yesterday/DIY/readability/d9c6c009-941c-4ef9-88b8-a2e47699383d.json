  "text": "Internet Sign in to your MUO account The convenience of online shopping is undeniable, but the vastness of the internet means you might spend hours (or days) sorting through the noise to find what you're looking for. Introducing more personalized support to the online marketplace is Google, with its new Gemini feature that makes recommendations based on your distinct needs. The comprehensiveness of the Google Shopping platform is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the platform saves you the effort of scouring individual vendor websites to compare features and pricing. At the same time, you're faced with the challenge of navigating a sea of options. To help with that navigation, Google Shopping has been \"rebuilt from the ground up with AI,\" according to a Google blog announcement today. Google has tasked Gemini to assess the 45 billion listings in its Shopping Graph in order to present you with a more distilled list of products. In addition to serving you more refined results, Google will also add a Gemini-generated brief at the top of the results, highlighting key things to think about as you browse. Google will roll out the new feature in the US \"over the coming weeks.\" How Does Gemini Decide What Products to Show You? Gemini will recommend listings based on how you search for a product. Just like searching for anything on Google, the more specific you get with your keywords, the better your results will be. For instance, you could search for a \"tennis racquet\" or you could search for a \"tennis racquet beginner.\" Using the latter on the Google Shopping platform will result in a more refined product list and a Gemini-produced foreword about how to find the best racquet as someone starting out in the sport. Similar to Google's new summary cards for email, a brief at the top of your Shopping Graph will highlight key tips for you to read ahead of browsing results, so you're not flying blind. Then, on each listing, you can read Gemini's reason for including it under Top recommendations. Here's how Google breaks down the new organization of its Shopping Graph: \"We’ll show products recommended by sources from across the web, and an explanation of why they’re a fit for your needs. You’ll also see categories that give you a more organized view of the types of jackets to consider. For those who want to research more deeply on the web, you can easily click through to relevant articles.\" For now, the AI summary will bear an \"experimental\" label, as the feature is still new. Google encourages its users to provide feedback on the briefs so it can continue to improve its AI technology. Experimental or not, it's easy to see how this update could combat the paradox of choice experienced with online shopping. As an ardent researcher, I can spend weeks comparing products, and have appreciated time-saving AI tools like Amazon's review summaries. After all, carefully considering your options can help you avoid buyer's remorse, but can also lead to decision paralysis. While Google's AI update to its Shopping Graph introduces a \"personal\" element, Gemini is ultimately still a machine. It will be interesting to observe whether its recommendations could be swayed by any external factors beyond research—you know, like money.",

days) sorting through the noise to find what you\u0026#39;re looking for. Introducing more personalized support to the online marketplace is Google, with its new Gemini feature that makes recommendations based on your distinct needs. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe comprehensiveness of the Google Shopping platform is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the platform saves you the effort of scouring individual vendor websites to compare features and pricing. At the same time, you\u0026#39;re faced with the challenge of navigating a sea of options. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo help with that navigation, Google Shopping has been \u0026#34;rebuilt from the ground up with AI,\u0026#34; according to a \u003ca href=\"https://blog.google/products/shopping/google-shopping-ai-update-october-2024/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoogle blog\u003c/a\u003e announcement today. Google has tasked Gemini to assess the 45 billion listings in its Shopping Graph in order to present you with a more distilled list of products. In addition to serving you more refined results, Google will also add a Gemini-generated brief at the top of the results, highlighting key things to think about as you browse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"custom_block_5\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoogle will roll out the new feature in the US \u0026#34;over the coming weeks.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-does-gemini-decide-what-products-to-show-you\"\u003e How Does Gemini Decide What Products to Show You? \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGemini will recommend listings based on how you search for a product. Just like searching for anything on Google, the more specific you get with your keywords, the better your results will be. For instance, you could search for a \u0026#34;tennis racquet\u0026#34; or you could search for a \u0026#34;tennis racquet beginner.\u0026#34; Using the latter on the Google Shopping platform will result in a more refined product list and a Gemini-produced foreword about how to find the best racquet as someone starting out in the sport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSimilar to \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/gmail-summary-cards-highlight-important-information/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoogle\u0026#39;s new summary cards for email\u003c/a\u003e, a brief at the top of your Shopping Graph will highlight key tips for you to read ahead of browsing results, so you\u0026#39;re not flying blind. Then, on each listing, you can read Gemini\u0026#39;s reason for including it under \u003cstrong\u003eTop recommendations\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026#39;s how Google breaks down the new organization of its Shopping Graph:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026#34;We’ll show products recommended by sources from across the web, and an explanation of why they’re a fit for your needs. You’ll also see categories that give you a more organized view of the types of jackets to consider. For those who want to research more deeply on the web, you can easily click through to relevant articles.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\n \u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, the AI summary will bear an\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u0026#34;experimental\u0026#34; label, as the feature is still new. Google encourages its users to provide feedback on the briefs so it can continue to improve its AI technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eExperimental or not, it\u0026#39;s easy to see how this update could combat the paradox of choice experienced with online shopping. As an ardent researcher, I can spend weeks comparing products, and have appreciated time-saving AI tools like \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/amazon-ai-review-summaries-easier/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon\u0026#39;s review summaries\u003c/a\u003e. After all, carefully considering your options can help you avoid buyer\u0026#39;s remorse, but can also lead to decision paralysis. While Google\u0026#39;s AI update to its Shopping Graph introduces a \u0026#34;personal\u0026#34; element, Gemini is ultimately still a machine. It will be interesting to observe whether its recommendations could be swayed by any external factors beyond research—you know, like money. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n        \n\n\n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
