Created by agency Ingo Hamburg, the series follows a household of IKEA soft toys as they face the everyday dramas of living together—from dating to deeper existential questions. Plushies Take Center Stage The sitcom is helmed by 5 main characters: DJUNGELSKOG – the world’s most huggable brown bear AFTONSPARV – the alien who has its own cult following BLÅHAJ – the shark that’s everyone’s favorite fave, diva, and style icon BLÅVINGAD – the brainy yellow octopus with an identity crisis KRAMIG – the ENTJ panda, your judgy foodie Other IKEA soft toys make cameo appearances in the episodes. Relatable Characters in Every Episode In the first episode of “Life in Stitches,” we watch as DJUNGELSKOG navigates the world of online dating. When he matches with SKOGSDUVA, an Arctic fox, their first date takes place at—where else?—IKEA. While I won’t spoil all the details, the date manages to be both whimsical and remarkably true-to-life. Without giving too much away, let’s just say that anyone who has experienced an online date will recognize the mixture of awkwardness and possibility that these plush characters portray so effectively. Episode 2 just aired, and it is just as good. What makes this series special is how it creates meaningful moments of connection between characters who, despite being stuffed toys, somehow reflect our own social experiences. The writing deserves particular praise—it’s clever, warm, and genuinely engaging. Judging from the viewer comments, I’m not alone in hoping the series continues for many episodes to come. And the theme song – it should top the charts! It’s been ringing in my mind. Non. Stop. Life in Stitches, yeah yeah… IKEA “Life in Stitches” Lyrics When the world is big and you’re small and sewnIn a Swedish warehouse, you call your homeThought life was tough, imagine being fluffBut your friends are there when it gets too muchOh Life in Stitches, yeah yeahLife in Stitches ooh ooh oohLife goes up and down, but it’s a wonderful taleThey’re dreaming big on a miniature scaleLife in Stitches Watch the episodes on Youtube or Instagram. IKEA As A Film Set This isn’t the first time IKEA’s sprawling showrooms and distinctive aesthetic have served as backdrops for filmed entertainment. The retailer’s stores have proven to be surprisingly versatile filming locations over the years. In 2009, the comedy film “500 Days of Summer” featured a memorable scene where the main characters playfully pretend to live in various IKEA room displays. The popular sitcom “30 Rock” included an episode where characters Liz Lemon and Criss visit an IKEA-like store, highlighting the relationship stress that furniture shopping can induce. Perhaps most notably, the unauthorized soap opera parody “IKEA Heights” achieved cult status when it debuted in 2009. Created by comedy group Channel 101, the melodrama was filmed entirely within the Burbank, California IKEA store without official permission. The series followed the dramatic exploits of fictional characters navigating love affairs and personal crises against the backdrop of IKEA showrooms, all while actual shoppers wandered through scenes unaware of the guerrilla filmmaking taking place. Despite its unauthorized nature, “IKEA Heights” earned millions of views online and demonstrated the store’s inadvertent potential as a ready-made filming location.",
