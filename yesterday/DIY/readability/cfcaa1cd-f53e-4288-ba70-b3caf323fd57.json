She decided to give her living room a fresh new look with a coat of paint and some wallpaper. But as with most room makeovers, one thing often leads to another. The old TV unit did not feel right in the updated space. Marlene’s existing setup, consisting of three BESTÅ units, simply didn’t provide enough room to showcase her favorite items alongside the TV. While adding a fourth BESTÅ might have solved the size issue, it would have been overkill and taken up more depth than necessary.Back to the drawing board, Marlene crafted a new vision for her living room: a wall-mounted TV cabinet that could hide unsightly cables and measure between 200 and 220 or 230cm wide (78 and 86 or 90 inches). She also preferred drawers to shelves for ease of use. And she didn’t want to “spend thousands of euros” either.That’s when she discovered the EKET series from IKEA. A Retro Vibe In Her Living Room Makeover “We wanted a sophisticated retro-like look that would complement the new wallpaper, old phone, and the IKEA SOMMARLÅNKE lamp I found in the bargain corner for just €20!” Marlene shared enthusiastically.With three wall-mounted EKET cabinets, each featuring two drawers in a brown/walnut effect, Marlene set out to create her dream TV cabinet for a total cost of only €300. Armed with a hole saw, Stanley knife, PVC circles, cable management supplies, PVC U-profile, and some leftover wallpaper, she got to work. IKEA items used:  3x EKET Cabinet with 2 drawers, brown/walnut effect 3x EKET wall-mounting hardware Other materials and tools:  Hole saw Stanley knife A couple of PVC grommets for finishing PVC U-profile piece of leftover wallpaper + strong double sided tape IKEA EKET wall-mounted TV cabinet: 1. Assemble the three EKET units and determine their placement on the wall, taking into account the location of the power sockets.2. Drill holes in the wall to mount the EKET cabinets (for installation later).3. Plan the route for the TV and other electronic cables making sure they are hidden within the cabinets.4. Using the hole saw, cut out one corner at the back of the first unit to accommodate the power sockets. Make holes for cables at the back of EKET units | Photo Credit: Marleen K. 5. Create holes on the inside of the first two units, allowing cables to pass through and connecting the units from the inside. Make holes for cables at the top of EKET units | Photo Credit: Marleen K. 6. Make additional holes on the top and bottom of the middle unit for the cable to go through. Cover the hole with PVC circles | Photo Credit: Marleen K. 7. Finish all holes with PVC circles (grommets). 8. Mount the units on the wall according to your predetermined layout, and connect the cables as planned. U profile cut and covered with wallpaper | Photo Credit: Marleen K. 9. Measure and cut the PVC U-profile to size, creating a small hole at the front for the cables. Cover the U-profile with wallpaper using double-sided tape and conceal the cables.

The most challenging part, Marlene admitted, was figuring out the cable puzzle beforehand. “We had to saw the holes, and in hindsight, we should have looked for the right-sized PVC grommets for finishing before making the holes. We did it the other way around, and it was harder to find the right sizes later on.”Despite the minor hiccup, Marlene’s IKEA EKET wall-mounted TV cabinet hack turned out beautifully. The wall-mounted design keeps the floor space open, while the drawers provide ample storage for her media essentials. The clever cable management keeps everything tidy and out of sight, and the wallpaper-covered U-profile hides the cables.“Simple solution, but quite a puzzle. I’m really happy with the result,” she says. See Marlene’s other IKEA hacks: Cube storage with plywood doors. HEMNES dresser with plywood drawer fronts",
