I usually don't want to drop cash on them unless I know they can deliver. Over the years, I've refined a checklist of quick tests you can do in-store or even at home that help me get a true sense of what a pair of headphones can do. These tests also apply to other audio devices like earbuds or earphones. 1 Sound Quality and Frequency Range Most human ears can hear between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. In simple terms, the lower the number, the deeper the bass; the higher the number, the clearer the treble. I'm more interested in how well the headphones handle the frequencies in between because I believe that's where most music lives. To test this, I usually fire up a few of my favorite tracks from different genres. I'll start with something bass-heavy, like funk or dubstep, to see if the headphones can deliver those low-end thumps without drowning out everything else. If the bass overwhelms the mids and highs, I will likely drop it. I don't want the vocals or instruments to sound like a subwoofer is suffocating them. Next, I'll switch to something more balanced to check how the headphones deal with mids and highs. One trick I always use is playing a classical piece with a full orchestra. There's no better way to see how headphones handle a broad range of frequencies than listening to all those instruments working together. If I can pick out the violins, drums, horns, and the subtle low hum of the cellos without any one part dominating, that's a good sign the sound is well-balanced. Of course, everyone's taste in sound is different. Some people love bass-heavy headphones, while others prefer a more neutral, studio-quality sound. That's why I recommend testing with the music you listen to. If you want to dive deeper into sound quality, use Audiocheck's cool headphone tests. These mapped-out step-by-step guides give you a true sense of what your new headphones are capable of. 2 Comfort and Fit ​​​​ Hannah Stryker / MakeUseOf Everyone's head is shaped differently, and what might feel fine for one person can be a total nightmare for someone else. That's why I always test my headphones out for 10 minutes or more to see how my head and ears feel afterward. This is especially important with over-ear and on-ear styles, where clamping force can make or break comfort. I want them snug enough to stay in place but not so tight that I feel like my skull's in a vice. If I start feeling pain around my temples or the top of my head, it's not good for me. A good pair of headphones should disappear on your head and not make you constantly aware of their presence. They should also have some adjustability. I like it when the ear cups swivel, and the headband has a decent range of extensions. That way, I can fine-tune the fit to avoid any awkward pressure points. I also pay attention to the ear cushions. Are they soft, plush, and breathable, or do they feel like someone glued cardboard to the ear cups? The material and thickness of the padding can make a big difference, especially if you wear glasses. If the cushions are too stiff, your frames will dig into the sides of your head, making you want to rip them off after a few minutes. If you don't wear glasses, you can still test this by wearing thick sunglasses or anything that sits on your ears just to simulate the effect. 3 Noise Isolation and Cancellation ​​​​​​ Justin Duino / MakeUseOf Before we dive into testing, know that noise isolation and noise cancellation are not the same thing. For noise isolation, I prefer to keep it simple. I pop on the headphones and play some music or a podcast at a comfortable volume. Then, I simulate the real world. I'll walk into a louder area or stand by a window with traffic going by. If I can still focus on my audio without cranking the volume, the isolation is doing its job. A word of advice: if you're testing in-ear headphones and the ear tips don't create a proper seal, even the best isolating headphones will feel like they're letting in half the noise around you. Don't be afraid to try different sizes or materials. Now for the fun part—testing the noise cancellation. This is where I get a little creative. One of my favorite tricks is going near something loud and obnoxious, like a running vacuum. I'll switch the cancellation feature on and off while standing near it to compare how much noise is reduced. If the roar fades into a dull hum or disappears altogether, that's a solid pass for me. I also make a point of testing noise cancellation in different environments. For example, I'll take the headphones outside where there's a mix of noises, like cars driving by or people chatting. If it can tone down the chaos without making the audio sound weird or muffled, I'm impressed. 4 Control Buttons Accessibility Justin Duino / MakeUseOf ​​​​​ If I'm out for a run or commuting on a crowded train, I need my headphones' buttons or touch controls to be intuitive and responsive, which is why I check their placement. Are they in a spot that's easy to reach? Some headphones have the buttons tucked away in places that are impossible to find without taking them off entirely. Ideally, the buttons should be positioned in a way that feels natural when you're wearing the headphones. If you can't find them without looking, that's a red flag. I've also encountered headphones whose buttons are too close together, making it too easy to hit the wrong one accidentally. I don't want to crank up the volume when I mean to pause my podcast. Next, I check for tactile feedback. Some headphones have buttons that feel mushy, such that pressing them doesn't give you any indication that you've done something. On the flip side, others give a satisfying click that lets you know you've pressed the right thing. I always prefer the latter. It's especially important if you're planning to use your headphones while exercising or multitasking. You want to control your music without thinking about it, and that's only possible if the buttons are responsive and give clear feedback. 5 Microphone Quality ​​​​I always pay close attention to the microphone quality on headphones—especially if I plan on using them for calls, gaming, or recording voice notes. The first thing I do is make a call to a trusted friend. I ask for feedback on how I sound compared to my usual setup. If they say I sound muffled or like I'm standing in a wind tunnel, that's a big no. A good microphone should pick up your voice clearly without too much background noise or distortion. If you're hearing complaints about echoes or weird metallic sounds, that's another dealbreaker. Next, I make a quick voice recording on my phone or computer. Most devices have built-in apps for this (like Voice Memos), and it's an easy way to hear how you'll sound to others. I listen for clarity—can I hear every word distinctly? Or do I sound like I'm speaking through a layer of cotton? I also check for background noise. If the mic is picking up every little sound in the room—my keyboard clacking, the fan whirring, or my neighbor's dog barking two houses down—they're not the right headphones for me. 6 Connection Options Jerome Thomas / MakeUseOf Whether you're Team Wireless or prefer the simplicity of a wired headphone, each connection type has its unique strengths (and potential headaches). Wired headphones are the classic option, and I prefer them over wireless headphones for many reasons. One thing I always test here is the cable itself. Do they use a standard 3.5mm jack, or is it some proprietary plug that'll drive me bonkers trying to replace it if it breaks? Also, is the cable detachable? Because if it is, you can swap it out easily if it gets damaged over time, which is a huge bonus. Now, for wireless, I usually want to see how the headphones handle pairing. I test how easy it is to switch between devices—say, from my phone to my laptop. If I have to dig through settings whenever I want to swap devices, I won't buy those headphones. There's also latency to check out. Wired headphones have no latency, whereas some wireless ones have a noticeable lag, which can be unbelievably frustrating. I'll usually test this by watching a movie scene with a lot of dialogue or action. If the sound doesn't line up with the visuals, it's a no-go for me. Some headphones give you the best of both worlds, offering both wired and wireless options. If you're the kind of person who likes the flexibility of switching between the two, this is something to look out for. One thing I test with hybrid headphones is how they sound in wired versus wireless mode. Sometimes, there's a noticeable difference in audio quality, and you'll want to know before you commit. Also, I double-check how they handle using the mic during calls. Some headphones will only let you use the mic in wireless mode, and this can be frustrating if you need to take a call while plugged in.",

If it can tone down the chaos without making the audio sound weird or muffled, I\u0026#39;m impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"control-buttons-accessibility\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e4 \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Control Buttons Accessibility \u003c/span\u003e \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/sonos-ace-headphones-sitting-on-a-table-showing-microphone-grills-buttons-and-usb-c-port.jpg\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;Justin Duino \\/ MakeUseOf\u0026#34;\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/sonos-ace-headphones-sitting-on-a-table-showing-microphone-grills-buttons-and-usb-c-port.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/sonos-ace-headphones-sitting-on-a-table-showing-microphone-grills-buttons-and-usb-c-port.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/sonos-ace-headphones-sitting-on-a-table-showing-microphone-grills-buttons-and-usb-c-port.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/sonos-ace-headphones-sitting-on-a-table-showing-microphone-grills-buttons-and-usb-c-port.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 481px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/sonos-ace-headphones-sitting-on-a-table-showing-microphone-grills-buttons-and-usb-c-port.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/sonos-ace-headphones-sitting-on-a-table-showing-microphone-grills-buttons-and-usb-c-port.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/sonos-ace-headphones-sitting-on-a-table-showing-microphone-grills-buttons-and-usb-c-port.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/sonos-ace-headphones-sitting-on-a-table-showing-microphone-grills-buttons-and-usb-c-port.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003cimg width=\"2100\" height=\"1400\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Sonos Ace headphones sitting on a table showing microphone grills, buttons, and USB-C port\" data-img-url=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/sonos-ace-headphones-sitting-on-a-table-showing-microphone-grills-buttons-and-usb-c-port.jpg\" src=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/sonos-ace-headphones-sitting-on-a-table-showing-microphone-grills-buttons-and-usb-c-port.jpg\"/\u003e \u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eJustin Duino / MakeUseOf\u003c/figcaption\u003e \u003c/figure\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e​​​​​\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf I\u0026#39;m out for a run or commuting on a crowded train, I need my headphones\u0026#39; buttons or touch controls to be intuitive and responsive, which is why I check their placement. Are they in a spot that\u0026#39;s easy to reach? Some headphones have the buttons tucked away in places that are impossible to find without taking them off entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, the buttons should be positioned in a way that feels natural when you\u0026#39;re wearing the headphones. If you can\u0026#39;t find them without looking, that\u0026#39;s a red flag. I\u0026#39;ve also encountered headphones whose buttons are too close together, making it too easy to hit the wrong one accidentally. I don\u0026#39;t want to crank up the volume when I mean to pause my podcast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNext, I check for tactile feedback. Some headphones have buttons that feel mushy, such that pressing them doesn\u0026#39;t give you any indication that you\u0026#39;ve done something. On the flip side, others give a satisfying click that lets you know you\u0026#39;ve pressed the right thing. I always prefer the latter. It\u0026#39;s especially important if you\u0026#39;re planning to use your headphones while exercising or multitasking. You want to control your music without thinking about it, and that\u0026#39;s only possible if the buttons are responsive and give clear feedback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"microphone-quality\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e5 \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Microphone Quality \u003c/span\u003e \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e​​​​I always pay close attention to the microphone quality on headphones—especially if I plan on using them for calls, gaming, or recording voice notes. The first thing I do is make a call to a trusted friend. I ask for feedback on how I sound compared to my usual setup. If they say I sound muffled or like I\u0026#39;m standing in a wind tunnel, that\u0026#39;s a big no. A good microphone should pick up your voice clearly without too much background noise or distortion. If you\u0026#39;re hearing complaints about echoes or weird metallic sounds, that\u0026#39;s another dealbreaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNext, I make a quick voice recording on my phone or computer. Most devices have built-in apps for this (like Voice Memos), and it\u0026#39;s an easy way to hear how you\u0026#39;ll sound to others. I listen for clarity—can I hear every word distinctly? Or do I sound like I\u0026#39;m speaking through a layer of cotton? I also check for background noise. If the mic is picking up every little sound in the room—my keyboard clacking, the fan whirring, or my neighbor\u0026#39;s dog barking two houses down—they\u0026#39;re not the right headphones for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"connection-options\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e6 \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Connection Options \u003c/span\u003e \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/soundpeats-space-headphones-earcup-close-up-1.png\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;Jerome Thomas \\/ MakeUseOf\u0026#34;\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/soundpeats-space-headphones-earcup-close-up-1.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/soundpeats-space-headphones-earcup-close-up-1.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/soundpeats-space-headphones-earcup-close-up-1.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/soundpeats-space-headphones-earcup-close-up-1.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 481px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/soundpeats-space-headphones-earcup-close-up-1.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/soundpeats-space-headphones-earcup-close-up-1.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/soundpeats-space-headphones-earcup-close-up-1.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/soundpeats-space-headphones-earcup-close-up-1.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003cimg width=\"2100\" height=\"1400\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"SoundPEATS Space Headphones with 35mm cord and charging cable in front of box\" data-img-url=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/soundpeats-space-headphones-earcup-close-up-1.png\" src=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/soundpeats-space-headphones-earcup-close-up-1.png\"/\u003e \u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eJerome Thomas / MakeUseOf\u003c/figcaption\u003e \u003c/figure\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e Whether you\u0026#39;re Team Wireless or prefer the simplicity of a wired headphone, \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/wired-headphones-vs-wireless-headphones/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eeach connection type has its unique strengths (and potential headaches)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWired headphones are the classic option, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/switching-back-to-wired-headphones/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI prefer them over wireless headphones for many reasons\u003c/a\u003e. One thing I always test here is the cable itself. Do they use a standard 3.5mm jack, or is it some proprietary plug that\u0026#39;ll drive me bonkers trying to replace it if it breaks? Also, is the cable detachable? Because if it is, you can swap it out easily if it gets damaged over time, which is a huge bonus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, for wireless, I usually want to see how the headphones handle pairing. I test how easy it is to switch between devices—say, from my phone to my laptop. If I have to dig through settings whenever I want to swap devices, I won\u0026#39;t buy those headphones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s also latency to check out. Wired headphones have no latency, whereas some wireless ones have a noticeable lag, which can be unbelievably frustrating. I\u0026#39;ll usually test this by watching a movie scene with a lot of dialogue or action. If the sound doesn\u0026#39;t line up with the visuals, it\u0026#39;s a no-go for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome headphones give you the best of both worlds, offering both wired and wireless options. If you\u0026#39;re the kind of person who likes the flexibility of switching between the two, this is something to look out for. One thing I test with hybrid headphones is how they sound in wired versus wireless mode. Sometimes, there\u0026#39;s a noticeable difference in audio quality, and you\u0026#39;ll want to know before you commit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, I double-check how they handle using the mic during calls. Some headphones will only let you use the mic in wireless mode, and this can be frustrating if you need to take a call while plugged in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
