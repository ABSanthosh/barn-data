  "text": "Smartphone Sign in to your MUO account Hannah Stryker/MakeUseOf Quick Links Relatively Compact and Pocketable Cheaper Than the Larger Variants Less Distractions Mean You Stay Focused Over the years, flagship smartphones have gotten much better but also progressively bigger. Recently, I picked up the Google Pixel 9 Pro over the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL. So, let me make a case for smaller-sized flagship smartphones. 1 Relatively Compact and Pocketable Hannah Stryker/MakeUseOf People these days love using big phones. But that's not the only reason why flagship phones are massive. Bigger camera systems, larger batteries to power high-resolution displays, and the addition of cooling systems to counter powerful processors increasingly required larger real estate. But there are still several people like me who prefer smaller phones. They are compact and fit in my pocket better—in fact, that's the pitch of modern flip phones as well! I find them much easier to use, especially with one hand. The weight's just right as well (which is a relief for my carpal tunnel syndrome-afflicted wrist). Moreover, a lot of women prefer smaller phones because often their clothes don't have large enough pockets to keep them in. 2 Cheaper Than the Larger Variants This one should be obvious but underscores the greater value that a smaller variant offers in absolute terms. The Pixel 9 Pro XL we reviewed costs $1,099 in the US, but you get almost the same internals for $999 with a Pixel 9 Pro. The obvious differences are the screen size and the battery—however, the battery life ends up being similar in both cases because the smaller screen consumes less power. I mostly go for the top variant in a series, like the Pixel 8 Pro in 2023. The Pixel 8 wouldn't have worked for me because it skimped on camera capabilities significantly. This year, since Google launched the Pro version in two size options, I went with the Pixel 9 Pro (instead of the 9 Pro XL) because, apart from other reasons why I like smaller phones, it also saved me a hundred dollars. 3 Less Distractions Mean You Stay Focused Fabio Principe/Shutterstock Contrary to the claims that large screen sizes are justified, a smaller phone makes me more productive. Hear me out. Yes, a large-sized phone makes media consumption or gaming a delight. One often hears the word \"immersive\" used in this context. But this immersive experience also pulls us in for longer periods. I want to focus on getting my things done on the phone and move on to other finer things in life—instead of doomscrolling on social media or wasting time tunneling through YouTube recommendations. A smaller phone doesn't hold you for long. Therefore, it lets me be more productive and reduces my screen time without a conscious effort from my end. While several brands do offer relatively smaller phones, they're mostly entry-level variants in their flagship lineups—like Pixel 8 or the Galaxy S24 or S24+. Companies usually reserve the top-notch camera setup and other cutting-edge features for the oversized flagship model. I hope more phone makers take notes from Google and offer mini flagships for those who prefer compact smartphones. Sure, they may not sell as well as their bigger variants, but companies get to make their customers happy by giving them options instead of forcing them to buy a huge phone to get flagship features.",

But that\u0026#39;s not the only reason why flagship phones are massive. Bigger camera systems, larger batteries to power high-resolution displays, and the addition of cooling systems to counter powerful processors increasingly required larger real estate.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eBut there are still several people like me who prefer smaller phones. They are compact and fit in my pocket better—in fact, that\u0026#39;s the \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/fold-vs-flip-best-foldable-phone-form-factor/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epitch of modern flip phones\u003c/a\u003e as well! I find them much easier to use, especially with one hand.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe weight\u0026#39;s just right as well (which is a relief for my carpal tunnel syndrome-afflicted wrist). Moreover, a lot of women prefer smaller phones because often their clothes don\u0026#39;t have large enough pockets to keep them in.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"cheaper-than-the-larger-variants\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e2 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Cheaper Than the Larger Variants\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one should be obvious but underscores the greater value that a smaller variant offers in absolute terms. The \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-review/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePixel 9 Pro XL we reviewed\u003c/a\u003e costs $1,099 in the US, but you get almost the same internals for $999 with a Pixel 9 Pro. The obvious differences are the screen size and the battery—however, the battery life ends up being similar in both cases because the smaller screen consumes less power.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eI mostly go for the top variant in a series, like the Pixel 8 Pro in 2023. The Pixel 8 wouldn\u0026#39;t have worked for me because it skimped on camera capabilities significantly. This year, since Google launched the Pro version in two size options, I went with the Pixel 9 Pro (instead of the 9 Pro XL) because, apart from other reasons why I like smaller phones, it also saved me a hundred dollars.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"less-distractions-mean-you-stay-focused\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e3 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Less Distractions Mean You Stay Focused\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/a-man-using-a-phone-while-driving.jpg\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;Fabio Principe\\/\u0026lt;a href=\\\u0026#34;https:\\/\\/www.shutterstock.com\\/image-photo\\/teen-drive-car-use-smartphone-young-2263950561\\\u0026#34;

Hear me out.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eYes, a large-sized phone makes media consumption or gaming a delight. One often hears the word \u0026#34;immersive\u0026#34; used in this context. But this immersive experience also pulls us in for longer periods. I want to focus on getting my things done on the phone and move on to other finer things in life—instead of doomscrolling on social media or wasting time tunneling through YouTube recommendations.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eA smaller phone doesn\u0026#39;t hold you for long. Therefore, it lets me be more productive and reduces my screen time without a conscious effort from my end.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhile \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/best-small-android-phones/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eseveral brands do offer relatively smaller phones\u003c/a\u003e, they\u0026#39;re mostly entry-level variants in their flagship lineups—like Pixel 8 or the Galaxy S24 or S24+. Companies usually reserve the top-notch camera setup and other cutting-edge features for the oversized flagship model.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eI hope more phone makers take notes from Google and offer mini flagships for those who prefer compact smartphones. Sure, they may not sell as well as their bigger variants, but companies get to make their customers happy by giving them options instead of forcing them to buy a huge phone to get flagship features.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n        \n\n\n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
