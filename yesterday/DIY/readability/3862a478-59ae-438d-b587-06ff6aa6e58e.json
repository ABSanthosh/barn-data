There’s a wonderful outdoor mall about 45 minutes from my house, I grab a latte and go store to store gathering gifts for my family and friends. It’s a ritual I do once a year instead of purchasing everything online, and it gets me in the holiday spirit. The skies were blue, I wore my coziest sweatshirt, and I gathered inspiration from the holiday decor. Next weekend I’ll repeat the same in my hometown and then fill in the gaps with online purchases the week of cyber Monday. Like all of you, we have obligations and events that come with the season, it feels good to prepare in advance to avoid the holiday rush, especially since I’m back working a full time job during the week. Favorite links from the week: This light and bright family home in Park City, Utah. Want your home to feel timeless, cozy, and lived in? Take some cues from this Inn. This is a pool house? The tile choices and warm tones are so lovely. Every 2025 Color of the Year so far. [Pantone announces in early December.] Handy tips on prices for mid century modern furniture. What are your thoughts on accordion doors? A clever way to use brown cocoa. Not just for gifts: inspiration for using ribbon in your holiday decorating. My favorite this season: this faux fur tree skirt in both mink and forest. As an alternative, I love this idea for a quick and easy tree skirt. Do you also feel the pressure of guilt tipping? Centenarians share their secrets to living to be 100 years old. Food for thought: why a bigger house does not equal a better life.",
