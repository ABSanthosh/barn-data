I might not have a friendly feline in the family, but quite frankly, my pup would love having another little hidey hole in the house. So, I could see this BESTÅ bench and cat corner from Tetanus Time Restorations living somewhere in our humble abode. The mastermind behind this BESTÅ cabinet hack planned to use their bench mostly for storage, kids’ bags, and a place to put on and take off shoes. All these things would be extremely helpful in a busy household. But they also decided to devote the leftmost cabinet to a “cozy cat house” for their cat, Lola. And why not? Nobody said IKEA hacks are just for humans. What do you think? Do you have a furry friend who would love a snuggly retreat? Even if you don’t, we bet you could put some extra storage to good use. What You’ll Need 2 IKEA BESTÅ cabinet units with doors (47¼ x 15¾ x 15 or whatever size works for your space) MDF board or thick plywood for the bench top Timber for bench top edging ¾” plywood 2” plywood Carpet scrap or squares Sandpaper Paint and primer Edge banding Miter saw Jigsaw Circular saw Wood glue Nail gun Basics — drill, screw gun, tape measure Appropriate hardware Foam and fabric How BESTÅ Becomes a Clever Cat House Complete With Seating and Storage 1. Assemble the BESTÅ Cabinets Photo Credit: Tetanus Time Restorations u/smokerjoker2020 | Reddit Put together the BESTÅ cabinets according to IKEA’s instructions and attach them. Position them where you want them before moving on to the next step. 2. Add the Bench Top Photo Credit: Tetanus Time Restorations u/smokerjoker2020 | Reddit This first look at the hack shows the bench starting to take shape. Measure the size and shape of your benchtop on your MDF or wood of choice. Cut the trim pieces to size, using a miter saw to make 45-degree edges. Attach the trim pieces to the bench top with wood glue and a nailer. Screw the top to the BESTÅ benches. You don’t have to get too particular about seeing the screwheads since you’ll be adding a cushion. 3. Time for the Corners Photo Credit: Tetanus Time Restorations u/smokerjoker2020 | Reddit The hacker used a combination of  ¾” and ½” plywood to create the corner shelves from scratch. They already had wood leftover from extra projects. They used 45-degree angles on the corners, building the shelves separately, then fitting them to each bench end. They didn’t include shelves on the cat cabinet side so their fur baby would have more space to enter and exit. 4. Prime and Paint Photo Credit: Tetanus Time Restorations u/smokerjoker2020 | Reddit Once everything is built to perfection (or to your expectations), give it a light sanding, prime, and paint. Make sure to let everything dry thoroughly between coats. Also cut the backer board for any cables you may need for your storage bench. 5. Add the Cushion and Cat Cubby Photo Credit: Tetanus Time Restorations u/smokerjoker2020 | Reddit Cut out the entrance for your kitty or pup, making sure it’s the right size so they won’t get stuck. Finish off the rim of the cutout with the edge banding. Add carpet squares or scraps to the entire inside of your pet’s cabinet to make it nice and cozy. Finish off the bench with a padded cushion for the top of the BESTÅ bench. Are the BESTÅ Cabinets Sturdy Enough for Seating? One commenter asked this very question, since the cabinets are rated for 44 pounds each. The creator responded that, “The side triangles I made are a combo of ¾-inch and ½-inch plywood, and they’re helping to carry lots of weight. My entire family could stand on this thing without it collapsing.” Make the Whole Bench a Pet Playground Photo Credit: Tetanus Time Restorations u/smokerjoker2020 | Reddit Another commenter suggested cutting pass-throughs between the sections to expand it into a massive pet area. They took it even further, saying you could get the glass-front doors to spy on your pet. I love the idea of making it longer for them (if you don’t need the storage). But my dog would probably run into the glass, so maybe swap it out with something a bit less breakable if you decide to play peekaboo. What do you think? Would your furry friend fall in love with this hack? Follow the creator on YouTube to check out tutorials on the restoration of vintage tools.
