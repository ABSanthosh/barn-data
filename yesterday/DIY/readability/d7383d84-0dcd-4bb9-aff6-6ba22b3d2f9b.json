  "text": "Artificial Intelligence Sign in to your MUO account As previously rumored, you can now download a standalone app for your iPhone or iPad to access Elon Musk’s Grok AI. Simple and Easy to Use Getting started is easy. Just like other chatbot apps, including ChatGPT, you can ask pretty much anything and receive an answer. Optionally, you can snap a picture or import a photo or file directly from the app. You can also ask the AI to create different images. All the answers use the recently launched Grok 2 model. Asking questions about the weather or a restaurant will show an informational card. The text and images generated can easily be shared with others on social media, email, messages, or elsewhere. You don’t need an account to start using the app, but you’ll be limited on how many responses you’ll receive. Without an account login, you also won’t be able to see responses to previous questions. Sign-in as available with an X account, email, or with Google or Apple. There is also a lock screen widget available for quick access to the app. The app is available to download now on the App Store for free. Expanding the Chatbot’s Reach A standalone app for Elon Musk’s AI was rumored late last year. In early December, the Grok became free for anyone with an X account. Previously, you needed a paid subscription to X that started at $7 per month. Grok launched in late 2023, but has lagged behind some other popular choices in both users and features. Introducing a standalone app that doesn't require any X account could help expand its reach to more users. Unlike competitors, Grok has a huge dose of sarcasm and wit, thanks to Musk’s influence on the chatbot. But while the chatbot is free, it is substantially different than ChatGPT and others and has a few key issues. It has weak ethical safeguards and the image generation has a substantial lack of content moderation. It also trains itself using information from X, which is full of bots and scams.",
