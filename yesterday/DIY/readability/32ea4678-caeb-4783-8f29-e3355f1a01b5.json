If you don’t have a good way to organize these things, they make a mess. And, floor racks take up space, so a wall-mounted solution is golden. Wall-Mounted Garden Tool Storage Rack Hack Karthik wanted to organize their garden shed, especially the long-handled tools. They also wanted to keep the floor as clear as possible, so they decided to hack IKEA’s TJUSIG coat racks. “I was looking to organise my garden shed so that my wife and I can easily pick up the long-handled tools. Also, we wanted to save space and did not want to place them in a tool rack on the ground,” he explained how the hack came about. Karthik opted for this idea instead of buying wall-mounted tool storage because they happened to have a couple of coat racks collecting dust in their attic and wanted to put them to good use. The idea is clever, quick, simple, and affordable — all really good qualities for a DIY and repurposing project if I do say so myself. It takes about 25 minutes and costs less than $35 (assuming you don’t have a couple of TJUSIG racks lying around). But it also gives your tool storage a more distinctive look than the typical store-bought solutions. What You’ll Need TSUJIG coat hanger | IKEA.com 2 IKEA TJUSIG coat hangers Allen wrench (if you purchase the TJUSIG racks, they come with the appropriate Allen key.) Level Basics — tape measure, drill, screw gun Garden Tool Storage as Easy as 1, 2, 3! Photo Credit: Karthik 1. Move Every Other Hook Unscrew every other hook on each rack and screw them to the opposite side. The idea is to get all the hooks on the same side.  2. Mount the Racks Measure and use a level to determine where you need to hang the racks. Make sure they line up so your tools sit straight, and mark those points. Also, verify that the mounting hooks on each rack are on the appropriate side, depending on how you plan to hang them. Install the screws and mount the racks. 3. Oh, Sorry, Were You Expecting Another Step? That’s it! You can prep and install this hack in two steps! If you really need a step three, pat yourself on the back and load up your new rack with tools. Finer Details on the Garden Tool Organizer This hack took the creator about 10 minutes to move the hooks and another 15 minutes to measure, center, and mount the racks. Karthik loves the minimalist look of the finished project, but of course, they primarily used the TJUSIG racks because they already had them. If you decide to replicate the hack, Karthik offers this heads up — relocating the hooks means you’ll lose the use of those dowels. But, to compensate, if you really want to, you can drill holes to use the dowels on the opposite side. However, they mention that it isn’t necessary, and for them, “it is an overkill … a hack must be simple and functional.” So far, Karthik says the garden tool rack works great, and there’s nothing they would change. However, their 5-year-old has a complaint — she can’t reach the broom. Oh, well, you can’t please everyone, right? Ready to Build A Garden Tool Wall Rack? What do you think? Could you use a hack like this at home? It definitely makes it easier to grab garden tools quickly and keeps everything looking nice and tidy. You could also use it for other long, awkward items that you want to keep off the floor, like pool noodles. Those things flip and flop everywhere! Interested in some other TJUSIG hacks? Turn it into a toilet paper holder, or use it for coats, but add a cool backlight. If you need more garden tool storage, check out this DIY tool closet.
