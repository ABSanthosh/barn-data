  "text": "Apple News Sign in to your MUO account It’s time to get hungry. Apple News+ will soon be the place to go to solve the age-old problem of what’s for dinner. Apple News+ Food Arrives In April With iOS/iPadOS 18.4 Apple News+ Food will land in April with iOS/iPadOS 18.4, which is currently in beta testing. The new section will offer tens of thousands of recipes from Apple News+ publishers including Allrecipes, Bon Appétit, Food \u0026 Wine, Good Food, and Serious Eats. All of those can be found in the Recipe Catalog. Recipes are added daily and favorites can be saved to access offline. In the catalog, you can search for something specific or use filters like Dinner, Easy, Vegetarian, Dessert, and more. Each recipe page allows you to easily review ingredients and see the instructions. When it’s time to cook, step-by-step instructions will appear on the full screen, making them easy to read from across the room. Apple News+ brings stories from more than 400 publications along with news from local, national, and international services. There are also a number of exclusive daily puzzles to solve. An Apple News+ subscription is $12.99 per month with free trials available. Apple also said that select stories and recipes from the feature will be available if you don’t subscribe. A Notable Addition, With Some Flaws Apple News+ has been a bit of a forgotten Apple subscription option compared to more popular names like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. Apple News+ Food could help draw in more subscribers with the well-designed features. While it might look like Apple is coming for some of the popular third-party recipe organizer apps, Apple News+ Food still has some big flaws. The biggest problem is that you can’t add your own recipes or import something you’ve found from TikTok, Instagram, or elsewhere. If you’re looking for a truly full-featured recipe app to use now, I can highly recommend Pestle. It’s a free download on the App Store for iPhone and iPad. With a subscription, you can unlock a wealth of features, like directly importing recipes from any site or social media, meal planning, and much more. It's one of the most-used apps on my iPhone.",
