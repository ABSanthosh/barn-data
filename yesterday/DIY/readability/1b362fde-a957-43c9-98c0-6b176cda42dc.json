I made new purchases—thanks to an expanding waistline—but neglected to let go of ill-fitting clothes (because maybe, just maybe, I may fit into them again?) But recently, after spending a good 10 minutes digging through my wardrobe for that particular mustard cardigan, it became clear I was in serious need of a wardrobe organizing session. So, I zipped over to IKEA to find some containers, bins, and other organizing goodies that could help me regain control of my closet. After trying out a variety of IKEA organizers, I’ve put together a list of my top 10 favorites that really helped me make the most of my space. Needless to say, these IKEA closet organizers come in after the exhausting part of sorting, discarding, donating, and categorizing, besides cleaning and tidying up the closet area. These organizers are the perfect finishing touch to a functional and tidy closet space. Here’s what I found that I think you’ll love too. 10 IKEA Essentials to Organize Your Closet Like a Pro 1. Maximize Space with SKUBB Boxes SKUBB Storage Boxes, Set of 6 | Photo Credit: IKEA.com Professional organizers always recommend keeping similar items together so you can easily see what you have and use them effectively. Enter the SKUBB boxes. These popular storage boxes are ideal for organizing everything from socks to underwear, helping you keep similar items together and preventing them from getting scattered throughout your closet. Once you compartmentalize your drawers and shelves with these boxes, finding what you need becomes a breeze.Plus, they work wonderfully for clothes folded in the Marie Kondo style, helping you keep everything neat and tidy.

Multiple Storage with KOMPLEMENT Multi-Use Hanger KOMPLEMENT Multi-use Hanger | Photo Credit: IKEA.com Long items like scarves tend to end up a tangled mess. The IKEA KOMPLEMENT multi-use hanger is designed to solve this problem. Hang it in your closet and thread your scarves through the holes – and not just scarves but ties and belts too.It’s not just practical – it’s a work of art. Your scarves become a colorful display that’ll certainly make your closet interesting. 3. Double Shoe Storage with MURVEL Shoe Organizers MURVEL Shoe Organizer | Photo Credit: IKEA.com This practical shoe organizer is a real space-saver, helping to declutter your hallway or wardrobe by stacking your shoes on top of each other. You get double the storage space with this smart, affordable shoe organizer. 4. Customizable Shelving with AURDAL System AURDAL Closet System | Photo Credit: IKEA.com While the PAX is often considered the king of IKEA closet systems, it may not be the best fit in tight spaces like a reach-in closet. That’s where the AURDAL system truly shines. This modular system begins with a basic frame, allowing you to add shelves, baskets, and rods wherever you need them. You can use the AURDAL planner to visualize your space and determine how to fit the components in your closet or walk-in wardrobe. While you might not be able to DIY a fancy built-in wardrobe with the AURDAL, it’s definitely worth a second look, especially considering its price point.

Bag Organizer with VARIERA Pot Lid Organizer VARIERA Pot Lid Organizer | Photo Credit: IKEA.com The VARIERA Pot Lid Organizer is designed for lids, but it has so much more potential. This accordion-style organizer is also fantastic for storing bags and clutches. Just imagine how tidy your shelves could look by using it to stand your bags upright, keeping them easily accessible and neatly organized. 6. Hanging Storage with SKUBB Hanging Organizer SKUBB Hanging Organizer | Photo Credit: IKEA.com Need more space for folded clothes? The SKUBB hanging organizer adds extra shelving to your closet without taking up any floor space. Hang it from your closet rod and use the compartments to store sweaters, t-shirts, or even handbags. It’s a simple way to increase your storage capacity instantly. 7. Add A Dressing Room Island If you have the space for it, a dressing room island is truly the ultimate wardrobe dream. Just picture it: a stylish and functional centerpiece where you can lay out your outfits, store accessories, and even have a little extra surface for your morning routine. The good news is that creating your own dressing room island doesn’t have to break the bank or be overly complicated.With IKEA dressers like the KALLAX, MALM or BESTÅ, you can easily build a beautiful and practical island that suits your budget and style. There are many ways to DIY this project, but from what I’ve seen, the most common approach involves placing two dressers back to back, securing them together, and then topping them with a wood board or a piece of glass.While I don’t have a dressing room island, I supplement my wardrobe with IKEA dressers for additional drawer storage and use the top of the dresser as my makeup vanity. 8. Prepare Your Outfits With GÅRDSMÄSTARE Hanger GÅRDSMÄSTARE Pants/ Skirt Hanger | Photo Credit: IKEA.com The name GÅRDSMÄSTARE may be a mouthful, but this smart hanger is a game changer. It allows you to hang multiple pairs of trousers or skirts on a single hanger, making it perfect for anyone with more clothes than closet space.But it gets even better. This hanger is also fantastic for organizing your outfits. You can easily place your skirt or trousers on one of the rungs, hang a scarf or accessories on the next, and drape your top over the hanger. Just like that, your #OOTD is all ready to go. Get 7 of these and you’re set for the week. 9. Store Seasonal Items in HEMMAFIXARE Storage Cases HEMMAFIXARE Storage Case | Photo Credit: IKEA.com The HEMMAFIXARE storage case is a fantastic solution for storing off-season clothing and linens. With its convenient zippered opening on the front, you can easily access your items without having to take the whole case down from the shelf. What’s more, these cases are designed with a sturdy, foldable internal wire frame, which means they’re not only stackable but also durable enough to hold plenty of items. You can maximize your storage space while keeping everything organized and tidy 10. Lighting Solutions with MISSMYRA Strip Lights MISSMYRA LED Lighting Strip | Photo Credit: IKEA.com I’ve tried using striped lighting in my wardrobes before, but I always found myself skipping it because it felt like an extra step—especially when I’m already rushing to get ready in the mornings. That’s why I love the MISSMYRA LED wardrobe lighting strip with a sensor. It automatically turns on as soon as I open the doors and switches off a few seconds after I close them.The lighting is bright and even, and you can even dim it to fit your space perfectly. You can install it along shelves or inside cabinets, ensuring you can always find what you need, no matter how dark your closet is. Decluttering your closet doesn’t have to be a daunting task. With these 10 IKEA closet helpers, you can organize your closet like a pro and make the most of your space. So head to IKEA and start your closet organization today.
