Microsoft has now been spotted testing a wireless transfer feature that'll make it easy to swap PCs. Transferring Data Between PCs Can Soon Be Easy Windows already has a built-in backup app that lets you quickly restore files and settings from an older PC via OneDrive. However, this feature isn't a perfect solution, and unless you have plenty of OneDrive storage, it's not going to be very useful except for bringing your Windows settings over. As spotted by Phantom of Earth on X, there's a new option to Transfer files to a new PC in the Windows Backup app. This isn't your usual cloud data transfer, it seems to be a new wireless data transfer mechanism between two Windows PCs connected to the same Wi-Fi network. When one PC initiates the transfer, you'll get a six-digit passcode to enter on the second PC to connect. The feature description notes that it can transfer files, apps, settings, and credentials over a network. For context, the existing Windows Backup app only lets you back up files from the Desktop, Documents, and Pictures folders to OneDrive, and remembers installed apps, pinned app preferences, accounts, Wi-Fi network passwords, other credentials, and your Windows settings and preferences. If implemented, it'll be a significantly better experience when switching from an old PC to a new one. Currently, even if you've got everything backed up using Windows Backup, you'll still have to install all the apps manually after the switch. The best way to replicate your Windows installation is to either move the entire storage drive between computers or clone your existing storage drive. Windows has had a file transfer tool for transferring data between two PCs before. The Windows Easy Transfer debuted in Windows XP Service Pack 2 and was in the OS until Windows 8.1. It lets you transfer data between two PCs using a network connection, external storage like USB drives or CD/DVD, or via a special USB cable designed for direct data transfer between two PCs. Microsoftâ€™s Shabby Feature Release Record Given how unreliable Nearby Share, Windows 11's built-in wireless transfer tool, has been, this could be another attempt to finally fix Windows' wireless transfer woes. However, I wouldn't be too hopeful until this feature starts rolling out to the stable build of Windows 11. Unfortunately, Microsoft has had a rather shaky record with releasing features spotted in testing. So, just because a Windows backup feature has been spotted, it doesn't necessarily mean it'll end up in stable releases. Related With Windows 10 on the brink of being discontinued, the new feature will at least ease the migration to Windows 11. With new warnings to Windows 10 users, Microsoft is desperate for people to upgrade to its latest OS.",

storage drive. Microsoft has now been spotted testing a wireless transfer feature that\u0026#39;ll make it easy to swap PCs.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"transferring-data-between-pcs-can-soon-be-easy\"\u003e\n                        Transferring Data Between PCs Can Soon Be Easy\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindows already has a built-in backup app that lets you quickly restore files and settings from an older PC via OneDrive. However, this feature isn\u0026#39;t a perfect solution, and unless you have plenty of OneDrive storage, it\u0026#39;s not going to be very useful except for bringing your Windows settings over.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAs spotted by \u003ca href=\"https://x.com/phantomofearth\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePhantom of Earth on X\u003c/a\u003e, there\u0026#39;s a new option to \u003cstrong\u003eTransfer files to a new PC\u003c/strong\u003e in the Windows Backup app. This isn\u0026#39;t your usual cloud data transfer, it seems to be a new wireless data transfer mechanism between two Windows PCs connected to the same Wi-Fi network. When one PC initiates the transfer, you\u0026#39;ll get a six-digit passcode to enter on the second PC to connect.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe feature description notes that it can transfer files, apps, settings, and credentials over a network. For context, the existing Windows Backup app only lets you back up files from the Desktop, Documents, and Pictures folders to OneDrive, and remembers installed apps, pinned app preferences, accounts, Wi-Fi network passwords, other credentials, and your Windows settings and preferences.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf implemented, it\u0026#39;ll be a significantly better experience when switching from an old PC to a new one. Currently, even if you\u0026#39;ve got everything backed up using Windows Backup, you\u0026#39;ll still have to install all the apps manually after the switch. The best way to replicate your Windows installation is to either move the entire storage drive between computers or \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/move-windows-to-another-drive/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eclone your existing storage drive\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWindows has had a file transfer tool for transferring data between two PCs before. The Windows Easy Transfer debuted in Windows XP Service Pack 2 and was in the OS until Windows 8.1. It lets you transfer data between two PCs using a network connection, external storage like USB drives or CD/DVD, or via a special USB cable designed for direct data transfer between two PCs.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"microsofts-shabby-feature-release-record\"\u003e\n                        Microsoftâ€™s Shabby Feature Release Record\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven how unreliable Nearby Share, Windows 11\u0026#39;s built-in wireless transfer tool, has been, this could be another attempt to finally fix Windows\u0026#39; wireless transfer woes. However, I wouldn\u0026#39;t be too hopeful until this feature starts rolling out to the stable build of Windows 11.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, Microsoft has had a rather shaky record with releasing features spotted in testing. So, just because a Windows backup feature has been spotted, it doesn\u0026#39;t necessarily mean it\u0026#39;ll end up in stable releases.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n
