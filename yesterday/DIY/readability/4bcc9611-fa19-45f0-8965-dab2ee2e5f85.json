  "text": "Peacock Sign in to your MUO account There has been a torrent of product reveals and releases during this year's CES 2025, but not everything announced was physical. The media giant NBC used the time to announce that its Peacock service is getting both games and short videos added to its service, albeit not everyone will see them. The Peacock App on iOS and Android Is Getting New Features As announced on NBCUniversal and during CES 2025, the company detailed its plan for the new year. NBC has a lot planned, but there's this one interesting tidbit: Looking ahead, Peacock will begin piloting new product features on its iOS and Android mobile apps this month to drive even deeper fan engagement around its most popular titles, all in one place. These daily mini-games and prediction games, along with new curated vertical video playlists of can’t-miss clips from Peacock’s biggest shows, will be tested before a broader rollout, unlocking new potential opportunities for advertisers. However, you shouldn't get too excited. As TechCrunch reported after speaking to a spokesperson, not everyone will get these games right away. Instead, they stated that \"some users will see both the games and the vertical video playlists, whereas some will see one or the other, and some will see neither.\" However, if no issues are found during the testing phase, every Peacock user should eventually receive the update. TechCrunch confirmed that the Peacock app will feature five games: Daily Sort, Daily Swap, Predictions, What The, and Venn. These games will have ties to Peacock's shows to boost fan engagement with their favorite media. For example, Predictions lets you guess what you think will happen next in the shows you follow. If you're looking for more announcements from CES 2025, why not check out these amazing pet gadgets or a grill that use AI to calculate the perfect cooking conditions?",

and during CES 2025, the company detailed its plan for the new year. NBC has a lot planned, but there\u0026#39;s this one interesting tidbit:\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n                        \n\u003cp\u003eLooking ahead, Peacock will begin piloting new product features on its iOS and Android mobile apps this month to drive even deeper fan engagement around its most popular titles, all in one place. These daily mini-games and prediction games, along with new curated vertical video playlists of can’t-miss clips from Peacock’s biggest shows, will be tested before a broader rollout, unlocking new potential opportunities for advertisers.\u003c/p\u003e    \n            \u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, you shouldn\u0026#39;t get too excited. As TechCrunch reported after speaking to a spokesperson, not everyone will get these games right away. Instead, they stated that \u0026#34;some users will see both the games and the vertical video playlists, whereas some will see one or the other, and some will see neither.\u0026#34; However, if no issues are found during the testing phase, every Peacock user should eventually receive the update.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eTechCrunch confirmed that the Peacock app will feature five games: Daily Sort, Daily Swap, Predictions, What The, and Venn. These games will have ties to Peacock\u0026#39;s shows to boost fan engagement with their favorite media. For example, Predictions lets you guess what you think will happen next in the shows you follow.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re looking for more announcements from CES 2025, why not check out \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/great-pet-gadgets-ces-2025/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethese amazing pet gadgets\u003c/a\u003e or a \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/brisk-it-smart-grill-ai-ces-2025/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egrill that use AI to calculate the perfect cooking conditions\u003c/a\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n        \n\n\n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
