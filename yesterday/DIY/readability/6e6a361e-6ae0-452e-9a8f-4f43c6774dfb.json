  "text": "Hello Friends. Welcome back to another weekly ten things I love roundup. This week we’re taking about books, home decor and things that feel like Spring. 10 Things I Love 1. As you can see in the photo above, we’re deep into renovations at my home. This is a new bathroom we’re working on for my seven year old daughter. We’re working with a moody colored mermaid theme. Lots of details like this. I can’t wait to show you how it turns out! 2. Now that it’s warming up I am obsessed with taking daily walks. I’m mainly listening to audio books on my walks. This week I listened to Story Genius and it was incredible. I highly recommend it if you’re interested in writing stories. 3. I love drinking Nello Supercalm in my water and the new orange creamsicle flavor is my favorite. It tastes like an Orange Julius. Also this water bottle is so cute. 4. I pre-ordered this cookbook. Can’t wait. 5. I’m ordering these for my guest bedroom. I love hosting! 6. I decided to go with unlacquered brass sinks for my kitchen remodel. Tell me if you think I’ve made a terrible mistake or if I’ll be happy with my choice in two years time. I do think it’s a little risky, but I am really excited about them. We are doing quite a few unique choices in the kitchen, though overall it’s still a pretty basic Nancy Meyers vibe. I’m going for timeless but also special. I can’t wait to show you! 7. I’m still obsessed with my stovetop popcorn. I make it at least once every single week. 8. I need a new printer and I am still 1000% loyal to my ip8720. We’ve been through so much together. If you need a printer that you can use for both photo printing and everyday home office needs I recommend it. 9. My friend Elise recommended this candle because I wanted a new non-seasonal everyday candle. It’s SO nice! It’s not too overpowering and really classic. 10. My husband and I are rewatching the television version of Station Eleven (based on the novel) for the third time. It’s so fantastic. I cry during almost every episode, which is my truest barometer for how much I love something. Cry or die! On that note- please tell me what movies, television or novels make you cry.
