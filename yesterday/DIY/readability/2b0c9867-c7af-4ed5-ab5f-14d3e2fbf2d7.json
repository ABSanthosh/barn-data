  "text": "Robot Vacuum Sign in to your MUO account With two new Roomba robot vacuums announced by iRobot, you can keep your hands cleaner without having to break the bank. Hold Up to 60 Days Worth of Dirt The Roomba Combo 2 Essential and Roomba Vac 2 Essential both feature a dock where the vacuums will automatically empty any dirt and debris after a cleaning cycle. The sealed bag in the dock can hold up to 60 days of dirt. Self-emptying is usually a perk of higher-end models. Without the option, you have to empty the dust bin of the robot vacuum after it gets full, which is usually just every few days. The new models feature 100 percent stronger suction power and a 120-minute battery. When the battery is low, the robot vacuum will return to the dock to charge. You can start a cleaning cycle by pressing a button on the vacuum itself, using the companion app, or with a voice command to Apple’s Siri, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant. It’s also possible to create a cleaning schedule. While it can’t create a map of your home, it will show where it has cleaned afterwards. The Roomba Combo 2 Essential features both a vacuum and mop and is available now for $429.99 through iRobot and other retailers. The Roomba Vac 2 Essential is available now at select retailers for $399.99 and is just a vacuum. It’s definitely more cost-effective to pay a bit more for the vacuum and mop combo as it can tackle more mess in a single pass. Better Technology for Less Robot vacuums continue to improve and become a part of more and more homes to help take care of arduous cleaning tasks. While robot technology is great, and can make a real difference in helping keep homes clean, they aren’t perfect. If you’re looking to purchase one, there are some drawbacks of robot vacuums to consider, like added expenses for accessories. Both of the new Roomba models are perfect for anyone looking to use the robot technology for the first time. While they lack features found in more expensive models from iRobot and other popular manufacturers, self-emptying makes using a robot vacuum much easier and requires less human intervention.",

Roomba Vac 2 Essential both feature a dock where the vacuums will automatically empty any dirt and debris after a cleaning cycle. The sealed bag in the dock can hold up to 60 days of dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSelf-emptying is usually a perk of higher-end models. Without the option, you have to empty the dust bin of the robot vacuum after it gets full, which is usually just every few days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new models feature 100 percent stronger suction power and a 120-minute battery. When the battery is low, the robot vacuum will return to the dock to charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can start a cleaning cycle by pressing a button on the vacuum itself, using the companion app, or with a voice command to Apple’s Siri, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant. It’s also possible to create a cleaning schedule. While it can’t create a map of your home, it will show where it has cleaned afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Roomba Combo 2 Essential features both a vacuum and mop and is available now for \u003ca href=\"https://www.irobot.com/en_US/roomba-combo-2-essential-robot-plus-autoempty-dock/Y054020.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e$429.99 through iRobot\u003c/a\u003e and other retailers. The Roomba Vac 2 Essential is available now at select retailers for $399.99 and is just a vacuum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s definitely more cost-effective to pay a bit more for the vacuum and mop combo as it can tackle more mess in a single pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"better-technology-for-less\"\u003e Better Technology for Less \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobot vacuums continue to improve and become a part of more and more homes to help take care of arduous cleaning tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile robot technology is great, and can make a real difference in helping keep homes clean, they aren’t perfect.
