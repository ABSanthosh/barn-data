IKEA U.S. has officially upgraded its IKEA Family program. For the first time ever, members can earn points along the entire shopping journey and those points turn into attractive rewards like product discounts, free delivery, and meals. This comes just over a year after IKEA quietly phased out its popular 5% everyday discount for IKEA Family members. If you felt that sting, this new rewards rollout might be IKEA’s way of making it up to us. “We wanted to provide enhanced value to them in every interaction they make with our brand,” said Nicole King, Customer Engagement \u0026 Loyalty Manager at IKEA U.S. “From special discounts to surprise offers and personalized rewards, this new offering is our way of saying thank you for being part of IKEA Family.”  For years, IKEA Family was known more for its cozy perks than for big savings. Members enjoyed free tea and coffee on every visit, access to special prices on select items, and invitations to workshops and events. It was a low-key but loyal relationship: you got small, thoughtful rewards just for showing up. Now, with the addition of interaction points and spend-based rewards, IKEA is upping its game, especially for repeat customers. Here’s How IKEA Family Rewards Work If you’re already an IKEA Family member, you’re automatically enrolled. Every eligible dollar you spend at IKEA earns you one point. That includes furniture, meatballs, even home delivery and assembly services through TaskRabbit. So, the more you shop, the more you earn. But wait, this new upgrade is not just about purchases — you earn points at every qualifying interaction, such as using the planning tool and creating a gift registry: 1 point per $1 spent on online and in-store purchases 10 points – Sharing a gift registry 25 points – Log into account on web or app, Create and Save a wish list, Use and Save a Drawing in a Kitchen Planning Tool 50 points – Create an IKEA Family Profile, Register and Attend an IKEA Event, Book and Attend a Planning Appointment, Create a Gift Registry When you rack up some points, you can redeem them for rewards. It won’t take long for points to add up. Just creating an IKEA Family profile and logging into your account will earn you 75 points, which you can redeem for a frozen treat (60 points). Benefits get better with more points: $5 off product purchases (starting at 175 points) $10 off any delivery (starting at 350 points) Free food at the restaurant or bistro (starting at 65 points) Okay, But Is There a Catch? The only catch is points expire after 18 months, so don’t hoard them like you do those Allen keys in your junk drawer. If you’re not a member yet, signing up is easy—you can do it online in under a minute right here. Membership is free. Just remember to log into your account when shopping online or scan your Family card in-store so your points get counted. Get Even More Discounts Now To celebrate this new benefit, IKEA U.S. will host a limited-time “Spend and Earn” promotion from May 7 to May 26. Consumers will earn $10 for every $100 they spend and will receive a voucher for their final earnings, which can be redeemed from June 3 to August 31, 2025.  So, if you’re the type who loves a good IKEA hack (and we know you are), those points could cover the cost of your next creative project.",
