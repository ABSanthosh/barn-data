All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 afterWhen DIY pro content creator Imani Keal moved into her Washington, D.C. apartment, she knew the original kitchen wasn’t going to work for her. Imani is known for her creative, vibrant, and functional spaces, and after moving in, she quickly got to work brightening up the space. While the apartment building is 100 years old, the original kitchen had been renovated since then. However, gaps were left between the appliances during that update, and the mice had found a home both in her stove and under the sink. She was on the verge of moving out of her apartment, but with it being rent-controlled, she wanted to stay. After inspecting the kitchen, her landlord and handyman planned to patch only a few holes and replace a cabinet, which wasn’t going to fly with Imani. She negotiated with them to gut the existing kitchen and, with the help of a few home brands, fully replace it. The original kitchen was completely removed, and a new floor was added. Imani used mouse foam to seal off any existing holes in the wall and installed peel-and-stick floor tiles from Wallpops’ CLJ collection. (All she needed were the tiles and a box cutter, and she used her body weight to secure them.) In all, she only spent $120 to create her new faux marble flooring.  Next on the list was updating the kitchen cabinets. Imani wanted to increase her storage space with larger cabinets, as well as getting a smaller oven to make room for more cabinet space. She worked with IKEA’s kitchen planner program, and they helped her design the new kitchen layout, all for $2,800.To add some color, Imani hung Otto Studio’s India Knit wallpaper (from her very own collection!) on the inside of the cabinets to “give it some flair,” she said. In the end, Imani’s landlord paid for the demolition and removal of the existing kitchen, including labor and plumber visits. They also bought her a new stove and dishwasher for the apartment and gave Imani a $2,700 rent credit to be used toward the cabinetry, microwave, and countertops. Imani paid for (and was gifted) the hardware, flooring, refrigerator, materials, faucet, and lighting. Because she knew her rights as a renter and how to negotiate them, she got an entirely new kitchen for a fraction of the cost.",
