All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 afterEven if you’re a renter, you can add tons of personality to a temporary space; just ask Olivia Henry-Jackson (@livhenry95), who, with her husband, Andres, transformed their bedroom into a dramatic red space. “The-off white and tall ceilings made the room seem really bare,” Olivia says. “Because it is on the smaller side, I really wanted to do the most with paint since we do rent and wanted a reversible change that would make a big impact. We decided to lean into the fact that this is a small room and choose a darker unexpected color that will level up the cozy vibes.”The bold red hue took many coats. Olivia and Andres tested three red shades to see them at various times of day, and their favorite was Valspar’s Savannah Red. “The next and biggest step was clearing out the room, taking apart the bed, prepping the walls, cleaning the baseboards, and taping off the windows and outlets,” Olivia says.She says they didn’t have to tape off much, and for the most part, everything went as planned — although it was a slight headache to paint after lots of furniture was in the room, so in hindsight, she’d paint right after move-in. She also warns others of initial splotch shock when painting with red. “I think the biggest hurdle to get over was the first splotchy coat,” Olivia says. “It is a pretty bold color, so when we first started painting, there were many whispered ‘OMGs’ because of the intensity of the change. Once we got to the second coat, the confidence set back in!”The renters painted the walls and the ceiling.Olivia says the lesson she learned in the painting project is “not to steer away from some of the bolder colors that intimidate [her],” and she loves the boldness — and budget-saviness of the paint. “I had never color drenched a room before and painted the walls, trim, baseboards and ceiling,” she says. “I learned how simple it was to paint a ceiling, and that just a change of paint can completely transform a small space.” Olivia adds that the red looks nice both in the sunlight and in the lamp light.New sconces complete the room.Speaking of lamps, Olivia says the new sconces “make the wall that the bed is on not seem so vastly empty. The room feels less like an afterthought and way more intentional now,” she adds. Her nightstands are from West Elm, her bed is from Wayfair, her bedding is from Parachute, her curtains are from IKEA, and her throw blanket is from Anthropologie. “A lot of our furniture that’s in here we have had for over five years, so we have saved costs there by working with what we have,” Olivia says. “I often shop what we have in our apartment to style a new space.” Olivia and Andres’ revamp cost about $300. Olivia’s advice for future DIYers — and especially future painters — is to “trust your gut and confidence in your ideas!” she says. “When you are implementing them, it may be a bit discouraging, but follow through and keep the faith. All mistakes with paint can always be reversed!”",
