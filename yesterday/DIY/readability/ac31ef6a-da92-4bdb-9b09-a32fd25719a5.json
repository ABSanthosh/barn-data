  "text": "Summary Repurpose an old laptop with Ubuntu for faster performance. Install lightweight apps like Min browser for minimal distractions. Focus on basic tools like FocusWriter \u0026 Zim for a distraction-free writing setup. As a writer, I spend an inordinate amount of time on my laptop. Unfortunately, I’m also easily distracted, and my laptop has plenty to distract me. I decided that I needed a computer built specifically to boost my productivity; this is how it went. Repurposing an Old Laptop as a Productivity Machine For my writing and productivity computer, I chose an old Toshiba Satellite Pro of uncertain provenance. After replacing the CMOS battery, it booted into Windows 10—but only after about 20 minutes. This would not do. A slow and clunky OS is not conducive to productivity. I opted to install a basic Ubuntu distro, and an hour or so later, the laptop was up and running. While it wasn’t a rocket machine, it was fast enough for the purpose. After installing it, I checked the apps and decided Firefox had to go. I would need internet access, but it would need to be a lightweight and no-frills browser. I used the sudo apt remove firefox command to remove Firefox. However, although it appeared to do as I asked, Firefox was still on the system. It was only when I ran the command sudo snap remove firefox did Firefox fully uninstall. Finally, I ensured there were no unnecessary start-up apps, and that was it. My not-quite-a-rocket-ship but fast enough computer was ready for the next stage of its resurrection. What Should the Productivity Machine Include? Keeping focused on the task at hand is something I’ve always struggled with. I can be working away quite happily and suddenly—oh, look, a shiny thing! And that can be me for a good long while. However, much as I would like to, stripping this down to a glorified word processor isn’t either practical or useful. Compromises will need to be made. Writing is a vocation that involves lots of note-taking and research, which requires apps. Of course, some form of word processor will also be required. So, for the next stage of the project, I need to select and install a basic set of tools that allow me to work with the least possible distraction. Lightweight and Basic Browser I considered not installing a browser, as the internet can be a major distraction. However, it wasn’t feasible. Having no internet would mean jumping to a different machine every time I need to check a fact, which would be at odds with the point of the exercise. To compromise, I opted to install a browser called Min. Min, a lightweight and fast browser designed to browse the internet with few distractions. Among its features are: Quick definitions: Find information quickly with information from various sources through DuckDuckGo. Tasks: Split your tabs into groups. Always useful when juggling multiple projects. Reader mode: Removes unnecessary objects like ads and trackers from pages, leaving just the relevant content. Focus mode: This restricts you from opening new tasks or tabs. Keeping you focused on a single project. I tried two or three other options before deciding that Min was the right one for the project. Brave came close but wasn’t as quick as Min. I also tried Falkon and Midori, but neither ran particularly well on my machine. Min ticked all the boxes. One lesson I learned was that I should have left Firefox installed until I had a replacement up and running. Although I could easily get a browser from the App Center, Min is only available as a download from the official Min browser website, meaning I had to install another browser first to download it. Hindsight can be a wonderful thing. Word Processing Software For the writing app, I opted for FocusWriter. The clue is in the name. FocusWriter, a basic lightweight word processor, has enough features to allow you to write without unnecessary distractions. Among FocusWriter's useful features are: Focus Text: This fades your previous text depending on your preferences. In the picture above, you can see this set to one line. Daily Goals: This can either be set by time or by word limit. Typewriter sound: Perhaps not a productivity aid, but there is something soothing about the sound of a manual typewriter chattering as you work. I liked this feature. Themes: Choose from a range of themes. I think the best thing I can say about this is that there isn’t much more to say. It delivers on its promises. It’s a lightweight, basic writing tool that keeps you focused. Note-Taking Software A note-taking app is another must-have for my productivity machine. For this purpose, I considered a few options before opting for Zim Desktop Wiki. This is a tool I’ve used before and its features just seemed to fit with the way I work. It's also a great distraction-free note-taking app. Not only can I use it to effectively draft whole articles (I don’t, but the option is there), but it's also great for structuring long-form projects and storing references. Among the features I like about Zim Desktop Wiki are: Logical structure: I can keep notes per project and have as many sub-pages as I need within each project. Links: Zim makes it easy to link to external files, resources, or other projects in the app. Easy to share data: Zim can use a basic .txt format for notes, making it easy to share them. I did briefly consider using this as my word processor and dropping FocusWriter, but I still found the plain interface of the latter better for keeping my attention from wandering. Other Considerations Before I could call the experiment a success, there were a couple of other points that I’d need to address. The first was how to easily swap files between Linux and Windows. There are plenty of ways to do this. However, ultimately, I decided to keep the installation as lean as possible and simply logged into my Dropbox account. Job done. Finally, I installed Pomodoro to keep me focused even when not writing. This simple tool is based on the Pomodoro technique. It keeps you focused by breaking your work into 25-minute sessions with a five-minute break after each one and a longer fifteen-minute break every four sessions. A simple yet effective tool that allows you to customize your session lengths and breaks to suit. Did the Experiment Work? Photo by Bob Sharp/MUO The short answer is—yes, the experiment worked. It only took a few hours to set the machine up and—at the end of the day—I had a machine that allowed me to work with a minimum of distraction. Do I use it every day? No, there are occasions when having access to all the tools and resources available on my everyday computer is essential. But I do use it two or three times a week, and it certainly improves my productivity when I do. Ultimately, it’s the technological equivalent of a quiet room—a place to go when focus and a distraction-free environment are required.",
