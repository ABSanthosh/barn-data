  "text": "While iOS 26 brings Apple's biggest UI design change in years, it also packs a bunch of new features (as you'd expect). However, not all iOS 26 features are coming to every iPhone, even if they support the new OS. Which iPhones Support iOS 26? Hannah Stryker / MakeUseOf As with every iOS release, Apple has dropped support for a few iPhone models in iOS 26. Not all iOS 18-compatible iPhones will support iOS 26. Here's the official list of iPhones getting the iOS 26 update this fall: iPhone 16 series: iPhone 16, plus iPhone 16e/Plus/Pro/Pro Max iPhone 15 series: iPhone 15, plus iPhone 15 Plus/Pro/Pro Max iPhone 14 series: iPhone 14, plus iPhone 14 Plus/Pro/Pro Max iPhone 13 series: iPhone 13, plus iPhone 13 mini/Pro/Pro Max iPhone 12 series: iPhone 12, plus iPhone 12 mini/Pro/Pro Max iPhone 11 series: iPhone 11, plus iPhone 11 Pro/Pro Max iPhone SE (2nd generation and later) If you own any of these iPhone models, you'll be able to install iOS 26 later this year (around September) when Apple rolls it out to the public. Notably, the iPhone X, XS, XR, and XS Max are some of the older models that won't receive the update. Which Features Are Exclusive to Newer iPhones? Just because you get the new OS doesn't mean your phone can support everything that goes with it. While Apple is bringing the new \"Liquid Glass\" design language to all iPhones, some iOS 26 features (mainly Apple Intelligence-related) will remain exclusive to newer iPhone models. These are some features that will only be available on the iPhone 16 series, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max. Of course, we can expect the upcoming iPhone 17 line (or whatever Apple names it) to support these too. Visual Intelligence With Search Sanuj Bhatia / MakeUseOf Apple has finally added a Circle to Search-like feature in iOS 26. Now, when you take a screenshot, Visual Intelligence can analyze the screen and offer suggestions. For example, if it detects a date, it may prompt you to add it to your Calendar. You can also search for products from screenshots via services like Etsy and Google, or ask ChatGPT questions about the image directly from the Visual Intelligence screen. All the reasons to love Circle to Search will come into play here, too. Live Translation Similar to Samsung Galaxy smartphones, your iPhone will now offer real-time text and voice translation across apps like FaceTime, Messages, and even phone calls. However, this will only be available on newer iPhone models. AI-Integrated Shortcuts Actions The Shortcuts app is getting a major AI upgrade in iOS 26. You can now create shortcuts that use Apple's AI models to perform AI-related tasks, like summarizing text, generating images, and more. These features will not be available on iPhones without Apple Intelligence support. Sanuj Bhatia / MakeUseOf Advanced Messages Features The Messages app is gaining several updates in iOS 26, including typing indicators in group chats and automatic filtering of texts from unknown senders. In addition, Messages is gaining support for custom chat backgrounds. You can set your own photos or choose from pre-made options, and Apple has also added the ability to create backgrounds using Image Playground, which leverages Apple Intelligence. Messages is also gaining the ability to create polls, making it easier to reach decisions in group chats. Using AI, the app can even suggest when to create a poll. However, both poll suggestions and AI-generated backgrounds will be limited to newer iPhone models. Enhanced Reminders No, the Reminders app is not becoming exclusive to newer iPhones with iOS 26. However, Apple is adding a new feature that suggests reminders based on the contents of your messages and emails. Since this feature relies on Apple Intelligence, it will only be available on the newer iPhone models. Related Other Features Several other iOS 26 features will require an iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, or newer. These include automatic order tracking in the Apple Wallet app and the new Genmoji update, which lets you create custom emojis just by typing a description. Why Every iOS 26 Feature Isn't Available on All iPhone Models Sanuj Bhatia / MakeUseOf The reason these features aren't available on older iPhones comes down to hardware limitations. Many of the new iOS 26 and Apple Intelligence features rely on advanced neural processing, large language models, and machine learning capabilities that are only supported by the latest A-series chips (A17 Pro, A18, and A18 Pro). These chipsets include a powerful Neural Engine capable of handling these tasks efficiently, without slowing down overall performance. Since older devices lack the computational power and necessary hardware to run these AI-powered features, Apple has limited them to newer models. Thankfully, Apple will still bring the new design language to all supported iPhones, so even older models can enjoy the fresh UI—though their iOS 26 experience will be more limited. If you don't care about Apple Intelligence, this might even be a plus.",

aren\u0026#39;t available on older iPhones comes down to hardware limitations. Many of the new iOS 26 and Apple Intelligence features rely on advanced neural processing, large language models, and machine learning capabilities that are only supported by the latest A-series chips (A17 Pro, A18, and A18 Pro). These chipsets include a powerful Neural Engine capable of handling these tasks efficiently, without slowing down overall performance.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eSince older devices lack the computational power and necessary hardware to run these AI-powered features, Apple has limited them to newer models. Thankfully, Apple will still bring the new design language to all supported iPhones, so even older models can enjoy the fresh UI—though their iOS 26 experience will be more limited. If you don\u0026#39;t care about Apple Intelligence, this might even be a plus.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
