  "text": "Sign in to your How-To Geek account Joe Fedewa / How-To Geek Jony Ive, the famous designer responsible for many of Apple’s most well-known products, is teaming up with OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman. This new company will focus on hardware that incorporates AI. This partnership, which has led to the creation of a new company called \"io,\" will bring AI even closer than before. The plan is to use OpenAI’s artificial intelligence, especially ChatGPT, to help design and develop new kinds of hardware. While he doesn't get as much credit as Steve Jobs, Ive's career is defined by sleek, simple designs and easy-to-use products. During his many years at Apple, he led the design of popular devices like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, each of which became incredibly popular in tech. Ive's minimalist style and focus on making technology intuitive have left a lasting mark not just on Apple but on the entire consumer electronics industry. Now, he’s bringing that same style to AI by working OpenAI. According to Bloomberg, this deal cost OpenAI $6.5 billion. We don't know exactly what the hardware will bring, but it will likely be a lot more than just another run-of-the-mill competitor to an existing brand. The collaboration between LoveFrom, Ive’s design firm, and OpenAI is a big deal. While the exact details are still under wraps, the goal is to create a new line of AI-powered devices. This isn’t just about adding AI to existing gadgets. According to the lengthy video announcing the partnership, the goal is to design devices that blend AI capabilities to improve how people interact with technology. This could finally lead to the day when we have computers on our arms like in the Mass Effect video game series. However, I am pretty sure it will be something like glasses that will give you AR vision and answer your questions. Related ChatGPT’s GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 Upgrades Are on the Way Hopefully, you won't need to think about which AI model you're using. Ive was the design Chief for Apple when it was making its biggest products for the first time, and led these big projects. So if he can make what Jobs envisioned before these devices came to be, he'll likely be able to make what OpenAI wants from its hardware. The new company, \"io,\" has brought together a talented team of engineers, researchers, and experts from different fields. Despite this, it is doubtful that this will lead to major innovation. A single AI-powered device appealing to everyone or meeting all user needs sounds a bit far-fetched. Still, Ive is probably the best candidate to do something like this. The key to all this will be making AI and hardware work together smoothly. While we can do that with our computers, a separate device won't have the luxury of a big, bulky case. However, if io can pull this off, it could set a new standard for how AI fits into our everyday lives. I am looking forward to hearing about what device is coming. Source: OpenAI",

biggest products for the first time, and led these big projects. So if he can make what Jobs envisioned before these devices came to be, he\u0026#39;ll likely be able to make what OpenAI wants from its hardware.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe new company, \u0026#34;io,\u0026#34; has brought together a talented team of engineers, researchers, and experts from different fields. Despite this, it is doubtful that this will lead to major innovation. A single AI-powered device appealing to everyone or meeting all user needs sounds a bit far-fetched. Still, Ive is probably the best candidate to do something like this.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe key to all this will be making AI and hardware work together smoothly. While we can do that with our computers, a separate device won\u0026#39;t have the luxury of a big, bulky case. However, if io can pull this off, it could set a new standard for how AI fits into our everyday lives. I am looking forward to hearing about what device is coming.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://openai.com/sam-and-jony/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOpenAI\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n\n    \n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
