All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 afterMinetta Archer, an interior designer and business owner, has lived in her 725-square-foot Harlem apartment for 15 years. In that time she’s been able to update her space, sometimes switching up the same room multiple times — including the kitchen, which she describes as originally having “bad ’90s laminate” and being in “very poor condition.” “When I moved in, I went through several different iterations before landing on the current design,” Minetta explains. “I made updates at least four times prior that were just placeholders until I could do exactly what I wanted.” In 2023, Minetta wanted to “push [herself] to create a more daring and striking design” in the kitchen. She didn’t have a specific inspiration to emulate, but Minetta knew she wanted to “go bolder.” The rest of the rooms in her apartment had been drenched in a mix of patterns and colors, and she wanted to bring that gorgeous maximalism into the kitchen. Luckily, Minetta had made adjustments the previous time she updated the kitchen (in 2020) that would make this time around a little easier. For example, she’d already sanded, primed, and painted the cabinets and added funky new hardware from The Home Depot. She started on the latest refresh by replacing the existing wallpaper with a peacock pattern from Rifle Paper Co. that “created more movement and interest,” she says. Next, she brought the outdoors in by painting her ceiling a bright blue to resemble the sky; she created a custom color by mixing a few blue paints she already had. Paint was also used to cover the vinyl flooring (she used a stencil to add a pattern) and the refrigerator. Once the painting was done, she covered the counters with faux marble contact paper, covered the existing backsplash, swapped out the faucet, and updated the range hood. What’s so impressive about Minetta’s new kitchen is that she did most of the renovations herself in just one month. And without a complete overhaul, she transformed the space while keeping the project budget around $3,000. “I love that I didn’t have to do a gut renovation in order to create something completely different,” she says. “There’s no denying the kitchen is the polar opposite of its former self. Never underestimate the huge impact a cosmetic renovation can have.”",
