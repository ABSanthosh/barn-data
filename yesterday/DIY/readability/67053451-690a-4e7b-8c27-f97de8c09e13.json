The middle section would be left open for a dog bed. But she didn’t stop at just placing the units – she snuck in a little hacking to give the credenza an upgraded look. KALLAX Credenza With Dog Bed Materials: 2 x KALLAX shelving unit 2×4 KALLAX door inserts KALLAX drawer inserts Construction lumber x 3 (Each measuring 2 in x 6 in x 14 ft) Wood slats Completing With KALLAX inserts Instead of keeping the shelving unit open and ending up with the typical KALLAX appearance, Brianna added drawer and door inserts to every cubby, reinforcing the credenza aesthetic. Then, she added shaker details to the doors and painted everything a dusky grey. The Behr cabinet and trim enamel paint was a custom blend made to match her kitchen cabinets.

Instead of splurging on expensive lumber or a fancy butcher block, Brianna got creative with construction wood. “I used three 2 in x 6 in x 14 ft pieces of wood that I joined using wood glue and clamps. It’s just the cheap wood they use for building but it turned out well once sanded and stained,” she explained. Finishing The Back Photo Credit: Brianna Westbroek To complete the look behind the dog bed, Brianna incorporated wood slats and painted them to match the rest of the KALLAX credenza. This detail created a cohesive and seamless finish, tying the entire design together beautifully. Styling The Space When asked about the artwork on the walls, Brianna revealed her secret to finding unique pieces: custom art prints from Desenio. “I used their AI art generator,” she explained. A quick and easy way to get unique artwork without picking up a brush. Now she’s got this amazing piece that doesn’t just look great – it works for her space and her pet. It’s got storage, style, and a comfy spot for her dog to hang out. Judging by how comfortable he looks, the doggo approves.See more IKEA KALLAX hacks.See more IKEA hacks for dogs.If you have an IKEA hack of your own, share it with us and you may be featured next!",
