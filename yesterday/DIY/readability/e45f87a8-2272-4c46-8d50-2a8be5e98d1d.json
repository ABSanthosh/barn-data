All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 afterCredit: Averie ColeAs an Australian-born creative now living in Jersey City, a self-proclaimed “risk-taker, adventurer, lover of interior design, and a hopeless romantic,” it’s no surprise that Averie Cole’s (@averiephoto) home is bursting with color. However, the photographer, CrossFit coach, and artist’s apartment wasn’t always this way.When Averie moved into her one-bedroom apartment, the place was relatively basic — especially the kitchen, which she says hadn’t been updated in 20 years, and featured standard elements like white walls and wood cabinetry. “While the neutral palette might appeal to some, for me, it felt stark and uninspiring,” Averie says. “I wanted my apartment to flow cohesively with the entire space, feeling like one connected art piece. A bold, impactful, and memorable kitchen was necessary — one that encouraged connection, shared stories, and embodied warmth and personality.” Averie had already painted a mural on her living room walls with several shades of orange. She wanted the spaces to “speak to one another,” and she chose to build that relationship through paint. She juggled different ideas, including a terracotta-colored limewash to connect the two areas, but ended up falling in love with a pink ombré wall. “I decided to test it during an evening of brainstorming. I mixed two sample paints into four gradient shades and painted a small side wall,” Averie says. “I was instantly obsessed! However, the ombré didn’t match the orange-toned mural in the living room, so I repainted it to include more pink tones, ensuring a seamless connection.”It only cost around $400 in paint to turn what was a blank slate into a stunning kitchen that flows with the rest of the home. Painting her home has been the gift that keeps on giving — Averie started a mural business after doing her own living room mural to help others experience the same joy she does from her home.",
