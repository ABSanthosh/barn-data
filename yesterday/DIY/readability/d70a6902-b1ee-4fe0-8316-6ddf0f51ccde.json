  "text": "Summary A PC builder created a computer inside a high-end graphics card, the \"Nvidia GeForce 5027 Piece of Rocks Edition\". The system is not a commercial product, reusing GPU fans for cooling, with an i7-1360P processor, 64 GB RAM, and 2 TB SSD. The \"5027 POS\" achieved modest gaming performance on 3DMark, excelling in efficiency with a peak power draw of 87.72 watts. It's hard to fit a high-end graphics card inside a small PC. So much so that apparently, it's easier to fit a small PC inside a high-end graphics card. Pretty weird, I know, but these are the times we're living in. A custom PC builder going by the name of CherryTree has developed a fully functional computer housed entirely within the shell of a high-end graphics card. It's dubbed the \"Nvidia GeForce 5027 Piece of Rocks Edition,\" or \"POS\" for short, the project integrates a complete, fully functioning system into a form factor typically reserved for a single component. This unique system is, of course, not a commercial product, but a one-off mod/creation. The foundation of the build is the chassis of a Gigabyte GeForce RTX 2070 Super graphics card. The original GPU and all of its internal components were removed, and the shroud was expertly modified to accommodate an ASUS NUC 13K-B. Of course, this doesn't have any of the actual GPU inside, but it re-uses the original fans from the GPU for the computer's own cooling solution. While the large heatsink and copper heat pipes from the original graphics card remain, they are purely aesthetic in this build, as they do not make contact with the NUC's CPU, but the fans work and spin nicely. At the heart of this absolute abomination is an Intel Core i7-1360P processor with integrated Iris XE graphics. This is paired with an impressive 64 GB of DDR4 memory and a 2 TB SSD. We have a few weird shenanigans going on, including a custom-wired power button and a unique power delivery system that adapts the traditional 8-pin GPU power connector to accept a standard barrel plug for external power. Related You probably can't play a lot of games in here, mind you. Throughout stress tests performed by YouTube channel Gamers Nexus, the 3DMark Night Raid benchmark, a test designed for systems with integrated graphics, showed the \"5027 POS\" achieving a respectable overall score of 19,291. However, the graphics score of 21,279 pales in comparison to the 125,923 points a genuine RTX 2070 Super would get. What this is good at, however, is efficiency, like it tends to be the case with mini PCs. Under a full CPU load, the machine drew a maximum of 87.72 watts from the wall, while idling at a mere 10-14 watts. As far as temps go, the processor's performance cores averaged a stable 75-76Â°C. Not the coldest temps, but good enough so your house doesn't burn down. You obviously can't buy this, but CherryTree does have other really cool, unique stuff you can buy on its online store.
