  "text": "Using a Galaxy phone over other Android phones means I can access Samsung's exclusive apps. However, not all of them are worth using. Over time, I've found myself ignoring several in favor of Google's alternatives. 5 Play Store Over Galaxy Store If there's one thing that makes an app store superior, it's the number of apps and games available. The Play Store shines in this area, offering almost every app that the Galaxy Store has—and much more. The only time I've actually used the Galaxy Store is to download themes, icons, and my favorite Good Lock modules. Other than that, I stick to the Play Store to find, download, and manage apps. Another major benefit of using the Play Store is that it syncs everything to my Google account. So, if I want to download the same apps to another phone, tablet, or Google TV, I can do that seamlessly. 4 Gemini Over Bixby When I first switched to my Samsung phone, I gave Bixby a genuine chance. However, that didn’t last long. Sure, Bixby can do all the basic stuff—from answering questions and identifying objects to changing settings—but it’s no match for Google’s Gemini. A major reason why I prefer Gemini is its deep integration with Google apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, and more. For example, I can ask it to check my calendar for upcoming meetings, summarize unread emails, or even pull information from my Google Keep notes—all without switching between apps. Further, Gemini is also superior when it comes to everyday queries. One of my favorite Gemini features is its ability to summarize YouTube videos with just a simple prompt. Download: Gemini (Free) 3 Google Chrome Over Samsung Internet Samsung Internet has some handy features like Secret Mode, Video Assistant, and Add-On support, but for me, Chrome wins easily—mainly because of its cross-platform availability. With Chrome, I can seamlessly switch between my phone, tablet, and computer, something Samsung Internet simply doesn't offer. Plus, using Chrome on my phone ensures that all my bookmarks, browsing history, and passwords stay synced in one place, making for a more seamless browsing experience. Additionally, Chrome has the edge over Samsung Internet when it comes to loading speeds, integration with Google apps, and webpage translation. While Samsung Internet does offer some handy features, they're simply not compelling enough to make me switch from Chrome. Download: Google Chrome (Free) 2 Google Fit Over Samsung Health When you compare Google Fit and Samsung Health head-to-head, it's a close call, as both apps offer similar fitness tracking features. However, Google Fit edges out Samsung Health for me with a few key features. My favorite aspect of Google Fit is the Journal tab, which makes it easy to review my past activities in a clean, chronological log. Whether I've gone for a walk, run, or workout session, I can quickly reference my history without any hassle. Another major advantage of Google Fit is its ability to record location data for outdoor activities like walking, running, or cycling. While Samsung Health tracks steps and activity time, Google Fit integrates with Google Maps to provide a clear visual of my route, which is more insightful. Download: Google Fit (Free) 1 Google Discover Over Samsung Free One of the things I like most about using an Android phone is how easy it is to access news and articles with just a swipe from the home screen. I've tried both Samsung Free and Google Discover, and for me, Google Discover is the clear winner. Google Discover offers a clean, minimalistic interface. I can effortlessly swipe through a personalized feed of news, stock updates, weather, and more. Above all, it excels at curating content and showing articles tailored to my interests. Samsung Free, on the other hand, feels cluttered and disjointed. It’s divided into three tabs—Watch, Read, and Play—making it feel more like an app than an integrated feature. Worse yet, it’s packed with promotional content, which makes it frustratingly difficult to find the news I actually want to read. While the above-listed Samsung apps may have better integration with One UI, that simply isn’t enough to win me over. Google's alternatives provide better cross-device compatibility and superior features that better align with my daily needs.",
