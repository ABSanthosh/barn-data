But if you're going to try this out, do yourself a favor and get a dock that stands your phone upright. Seriously. It Looks Much Tidier Bertel King / MakeUseOf There are two types of USB-C docks. There's the standard variety dock or docking station designed with laptops in mind. They extend out from the side of your computer, allowing a laptop with very few ports (often a MacBook) to connect to a full-sized HDMI or Ethernet cable. These docks work with phones, too, but they look messier. Your phone lies flat on your desk or TV stand, while cables extend out from the bottom. These cables take up more space than the phone, drawing your eyes to the abundance of cords. Your PC or TV setup then looks like a screen with a bunch of cords spread out underneath—not visually appealing. An upright dock more easily angles cables so they go behind your desk or TV stand, much like a mini PC or streaming box would. Your Phone's Less Likely to Get Scuffed Up When connected to a conventional USB-C dock, your phone will either lie on its face or back. That means you're potentially scratching up your screen or your camera bump, unless you have your phone in a case that lifts it up. Even if you have a screen protector applied, you're potentially shortening its lifespan as well—or at least the period when your protector looks pristine. The dock and cords together also weigh more than the phone, so you'll jostle the phone around anytime you mess with the cords. A dock that stands your phone up doesn't abuse your phone, regardless of whether you have yours in a case or keep it natural (I'm team naked phone, personally). When the time comes to mess with the cables, you're scuffing the dock against the desk, not your phone. Your Phone Remains Much More Accessible An upright dock keeps your phone screen visible at all times. Most of the time, the display is off. Yet when a notification comes in, you can easily see it—especially nice if your phone offers an always-on display. At a desk, it's also easier to reach over and change the track, swipe away a notification, or whatever else. If you're using a desktop mode like Samsung DeX, an upright dock makes your phone feel like a second display. You can handle just about everything from the main screen, but if you want to have a video playing off to the side or keep your podcasts off the big display, you have the option. It's a Look Bertel King / MakeUseOf A phone dock next to your monitor sends two possible signals. One is that you use your phone as a PC, like I do. People in the know might ponder if you're using DeX or something similar. Those not in the know might be surprised when they see you plop down your phone and a desktop appears. People might be even more impressed in your living room, when you pull out a game controller and fire up cloud gaming. Yet a dock isn't just for DeX users. Instead, the phone dock might signal you've thought about where your phone goes during your work day. After all, the monitor could be an iMac or any regular monitor with a mini PC VESA mounted to the back. We've had years to get over the expectation that a monitor needs a tower beside it to work. Even if no one ever sees your setup but you, an upright dock can still be a piece that helps you achieve that dream office look you've been going for. Since most phones have their USB-C port in the same spot, it really doesn't matter which upright dock you get. I've used a phone with and without a case just fine. Since getting a foldable, I've been able to drop my phone in the same dock without issues. So even if a dock costs $40 instead of $20 (like the Cable Matters 5-in-1 dock I grabbed on Amazon), treat yourself. It's a worthy investment.",

There\u0026#39;s the standard variety \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/best-usb-c-docking-stations/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edock or docking station designed with laptops in mind\u003c/a\u003e. They extend out from the side of your computer, allowing a laptop with very few ports (often a MacBook) to connect to a full-sized HDMI or Ethernet cable. These docks work with phones, too, but they look messier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour phone lies flat on your desk or TV stand, while cables extend out from the bottom. These cables take up more space than the phone, drawing your eyes to the abundance of cords. Your PC or TV setup then looks like a screen with a bunch of cords spread out underneath—not visually appealing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn upright dock more easily angles cables so they go behind your desk or TV stand, much like a mini PC or streaming box would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"your-phone-39-s-less-likely-to-get-scuffed-up\"\u003e Your Phone\u0026#39;s Less Likely to Get Scuffed Up \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen connected to a conventional USB-C dock, your phone will either lie on its face or back. That means you\u0026#39;re potentially scratching up your screen or your camera bump, unless you have your phone in a case that lifts it up. Even if you have a screen protector applied, you\u0026#39;re potentially shortening its lifespan as well—or at least the period when your protector looks pristine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe dock and cords together also weigh more than the phone, so you\u0026#39;ll jostle the phone around anytime you mess with the cords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA dock that stands your phone up doesn\u0026#39;t abuse your phone, regardless of whether you have yours in a case or keep it natural (I\u0026#39;m team naked phone, personally). When the time comes to mess with the cables, you\u0026#39;re scuffing the dock against the desk, not your phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"your-phone-remains-much-more-accessible\"\u003e Your Phone Remains Much More Accessible \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn upright dock keeps your phone screen visible at all times. Most of the time, the display is off. Yet when a notification comes in, you can easily see it—especially nice if your phone offers an always-on display. At a desk, it\u0026#39;s also easier to reach over and change the track, swipe away a notification, or whatever else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re using a \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/samsung-dex-phone-computer/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edesktop mode like Samsung DeX\u003c/a\u003e, an upright dock makes your phone feel like a second display.

One is that you \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/i-ditched-my-pc-for-a-foldable-phone/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003euse your phone as a PC\u003c/a\u003e, like I do. People in the know might ponder if you\u0026#39;re using DeX or something similar. Those not in the know might be surprised when they see you plop down your phone and a desktop appears. People might be even more impressed in your living room, when you pull out a game controller and fire up cloud gaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYet a dock isn\u0026#39;t just for DeX users. Instead, the phone dock might signal you\u0026#39;ve thought about where your phone goes during your work day. After all, the monitor could be an iMac or any regular monitor with a mini PC \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-vesa/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVESA mounted to the back\u003c/a\u003e.

I\u0026#39;ve used a phone with and without a case just fine. Since getting a foldable, I\u0026#39;ve been able to drop my phone in the same dock without issues. So even if a dock costs $40 instead of $20 (like the Cable Matters 5-in-1 dock I grabbed on \u003ca href=\"https://a.co/d/fSbqg1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e), treat yourself.
