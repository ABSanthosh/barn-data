  "text": "Greetings friends, I’ve been away for a little while. I’ve been working long hours at my law firm and took some time to visit our home in Florida for a week during the fourth of July, we made some nice memories with our family sitting around talking and watching fireworks on Siesta Key Beach. A few days ago I enjoyed a picnic at my favorite botanical garden in Sonoma. Summer has been really lovely so far. There are a few new things in the works right now, and some shifts that will occur soon. I’m a few steps closer to the idyllic life I’m creating for myself and my family. I can’t announce quite yet, but all of it has been worth the wait and is the result of persistence and hard work. I’ll share those updates once they are finalized. I hope all of you are enjoying your summer too, finding relaxation and rest and moments of peace. Favorite links from the week:   I pinned several of the personalized cozy spaces in this cottage. Isn’t this tiled door frame stunning? Lessons on how to add charm to a small apartment rental. Have you seen the custom color service at Society Social? 59 ways to beautify your back yard. Decorative items that are “better thrifted than new”. Vertical tile installations that add height to bathroom spaces. Searching all around my house for a space to hang this elegant wall mirror. Should you buy it? Questions to ask before you do. Wow, what a great garage transformation. Halloween lovers, there’s an early drop of spooky decor over at IKEA’s site. Reds, whites, and PINK: the singer’s story on how she makes wine. The internet is divided on this sweet treat. These artful words about design.",
