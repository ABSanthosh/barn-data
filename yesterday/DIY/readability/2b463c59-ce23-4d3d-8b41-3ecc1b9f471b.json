This upcycling project, which Matteo calls the “EXPEDIT Bike Furniture,” offers a budget-friendly alternative to pricey, specialized bike storage systems. “I decided to hack an old EXPEDIT 5×5 that I didn’t need anymore at home to organize the basement space better,” Matteo explains. He adds, “On the Internet, there is similar storage furniture for bikes and cycling accessories, but these are usually fashion items.” Which didn’t work for him. The beauty of this hack lies in its simplicity. With just eight L-brackets, screws, and a bit of creativity, Matteo has given new life to an old piece of furniture. The hack works equally well with the newer KALLAX shelving unit, making it accessible to a wide range of IKEA enthusiasts. DIY Bike Rack Hack With IKEA Shelving Photo Credit: Matteo Pirola Materials Needed 1x IKEA EXPEDIT 5×5 (or Kallax) 8 L-brackets 16 screws Standard long wooden pins Step-by-Step DIY Bike Rack Hack Instructions 1. Partially assemble the frame The assembly process is straightforward, with a few tweaks to the standard instructions. Matteo advises, “Follow the standard assembly instructions but stop at the first level allowing enough space to accommodate your bike.” 2. Complete the structure Finish assembling the entire frame structure of the EXPEDIT or KALLAX unit. 3. Prop the bike Photo Credit: Matteo Pirola The key to creating the bike storage space is in the clever use of the “small squares” (the individual cube dividers) and L-brackets. To prop the bike up, install two cubes using the shelves and provided dowels. Secure the top shelf with L-brackets. 4. Insert wooden dowels Photo Credit: Matteo Pirola Use two long wooden dowels inserted into the dowel holes to hold the bike tires in place and keep the bike upright.If the exposed particle board bothers you, finish it with a strip of edge banding before inserting the dowels. Sealing the exposed edges will also make the setup more durable and easier to clean. Leftover parts for more DIY For those looking to maximize their hack, Matteo offers a bonus tip: “With the remaining parts and some additional L-brackets and screws it is possible to create an additional 2×5 furniture.”See our collection of ideas on KALLAX shelving unit hacks. The hardest part about this bike rack hack Photo Credit: Matteo Pirola While the project itself was smooth sailing, Matteo did face one challenge: space constraints. “The most critical point of this hack was the space available to assemble the furniture. My basement is narrow (in fact I could not capture the final result in a single shot),” he shares. Bike Storage and Cycling Accessories Storage Photo Credit: Matteo Pirola Matteo is thoroughly pleased with the final result and the storage it provides. He concludes, “I’ve got so much stuff in the basement. For sure, I’ll fill them with the bike accessories (shoes, helmet) and the spare parts.” He found a win-win solution that declutters his basement while creating an organized station for his two-wheeled companion. What we love about this hack is how it showcases the bike, almost like an art installation. If you love your bike, this hack gives it the stage it deserves.For those who prefer ground-level storage, this hack works equally well on the bottom shelf, sparing you the effort of lifting your bike. Install the cubes at the top for storage instead. However, when opting for this top-heavy setup, it’s best to anchor the KALLAX to the wall for safety, preventing any unwanted tip-over accidents.Have an IKEA hack you’re proud of? Share it with us and you might be featured next.
