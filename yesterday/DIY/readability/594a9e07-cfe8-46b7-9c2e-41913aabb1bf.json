  "text": "Skip to content If you’re passionate about signal processing and retro tech, you’ll want to check out the Createc SC 01, a quirky handheld oscilloscope that recently caught the eye of [Thomas Scherrer] from OZ2CPU Teardown. This device, cheekily dubbed a “signal computer,” promises to be both intriguing and, perhaps, frustrating. You can view [Thomas]’ original teardown video here. This device is packed with buttons and a surprisingly retro aesthetic that can make even the most seasoned hacker feel nostalgic. With a sample rate of 20 MHz and a bandwidth of up to 10 MHz, it’s a digital oscilloscope with a twist. Users may find its setup challenging, thanks to a somewhat convoluted manual that boasts numerous errors. However, beneath the confusion lies the potential for creative exploration: this signal computer can analyse analog signals, perform calculations, and even store data. Despite its quirks, the SC 01 is sure the experience. Imagine troubleshooting a circuit while grappling with its unpredictable user interface—an adventure in itself for those who like a techy challenge. The Createc SC 01 is not just another tool; it’s an invitation to embrace the imperfections of vintage tech. If you enjoy the hands-on learning process and don’t shy away from a few hiccups, this device might be something you’ll enjoy. Hackaday featured an article on similar devices last year. Check out the full teardown video to see this fancy but quirky pocket oscilloscope in action.",
