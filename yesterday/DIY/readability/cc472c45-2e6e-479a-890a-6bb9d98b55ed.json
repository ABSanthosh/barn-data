Summertime barbecues are a highlight of the season, and children inevitably want to help flip burgers and see what’s cooking. You end up spending more time saying, “Get away from the grill,” than you do preparing the food. Before you know it, you have a tray of overdone steaks and extra-crispy chicken. Luckily, two clever DIYers, Lukasz Zet @diy_by_luki and Marlena Schubert @schuberts_haustagebuch have cracked the code. Their imaginative toy BBQ pits let kids join in on the fun with their own “grill stations,” keeping them happily distracted (and far from the flames). Perfect for role-playing and pretend fun. Hack #1 – From Breadbox to BBQ Grill Set Photo Credit: Lukasz Zet @diy_by_luki Lukas wanted to make something that had never been seen before, so when he found an old MAGASIN breadbox in the attic, this is what he did. What You’ll Need 1 IKEA NESNA nightstand 1 IKEA MAGASIN breadbox 1 basic wooden tray Glass stones Shallow bowl LED lights (red or orange) Spray paint Cabinet knobs Screws Adhesive Basics — drill, screw gun Toy grill accessories 1. Paint the Table and Breadbox Paint the breadbox and table. Lukas used a combination of black, gold, and rose gold. He used the IKEA NESNA nightstand, which isn’t available in IKEA US, but you can find something similar (KNARREVIK nightstand). 2. Create the Grill Effect Photo Credit: Lukasz Zet @diy_by_luki Line the inside of the bowl with red LED strip lights or color-changing lights. Drill a hole in the bottom of the breadbox and tray to pass the LED cord through (unless you’re using battery-operated). Fill the bowl with the glass stones and turn on the light to create a really cool effect. 2. Attach Everything Together Screw the tray into the top of the table and then attach the breadbox to the tray by screwing through the bottom. Glue the bowl into the center of the breadbox to keep it in place. 3. Add Knobs and Accessories Photo Credit: Lukasz Zet @diy_by_luki Use knobs on the front of your toy BBQ and any other accessories, like a grill thermometer, to make it look more realistic. Add a few cooking utensils and other toy tools. Hack #2 – A Deconstructed Crate Becomes a Toy BBQ Pit What You’ll Need 1 IKEA KNAGGLIG box (large) 1 IKEA KNARREVIK nightstand Assembly adhesive Magnets Wooden discs Paint Toy accessories 1. Disassemble the KNAGGLIG Marlena pulled apart the large KNAGGLIG box to turn it into all of the parts of the toy grill. Keep one wide side intact for the back wall of the grill and the two short sides together for the side shelves. Everything else comes apart. 2. Build the Barbecue Position the various pieces of the KNAGGLIG onto the KNARREVIK nightstand to transform it into a toy barbecue grill. The remaining wide side of the crate comes apart to become the board across the front and to fix the shelves in place. To hold everything in place, she used magnets glued to the wooden parts and then attached to the metal frame — a genius touch that makes the whole setup easy to take apart once summer’s over. 3. Make the Barbecue Grate Paint the small pieces of the KNAGGLIG. Position them across the top of the table to act as the grill grate. 4. Accessorize and Add Details Paint the wooden discs and attach them to the front board. Add any accessories you desire to ramp up the grill effect and fuel countless hours of playtime. Which Hack Will You Do? These clever hacks prove that one simple idea — a toy grill — can spark wildly creative interpretations. Do you have a favorite? I think both grills are amazing, and any kid would love having either one (or both!). There’s something heartwarming about kids mimicking the grown-ups, especially during cookouts. When my son was little, he had a toy barbecue pit he “cooked” on while my husband worked the grill. It didn’t look nearly as polished as these DIYs, but to him, it was just like dad’s — and that was all that mattered. If your kids had a toy grill, they’d likely focus on their cooking creations instead of trying to get up close and personal with the real deal. That’s definitely a bonus, and of course, they’d get plenty of enjoyment from them, too. Don’t forget to check out Marlena’s build and LukasZ’s breadbox BBQ, and give them a follow on Instagram: @schuberts_haustagebuch and @diy_by_luki. Loved these hacks? We want to see yours!
