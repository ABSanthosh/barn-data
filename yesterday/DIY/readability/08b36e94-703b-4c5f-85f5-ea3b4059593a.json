  "text": "In the most comprehensive global sleep study ever conducted, IKEA surveyed 55,000 people across 57 markets – and the results challenge everything we thought we knew about rest. If sleep was an Olympic sport, China would take gold while the US and Norway – despite their high living standards – would be fighting to avoid last place. This groundbreaking research reveals not just who’s sleeping best, but also exposes a troubling global sleep deficit of 1 hour and 20 minutes per night – that’s over 20 full days of lost sleep every year. Countries With the Best Sleep Leading the pack is Mainland China, where residents consistently clock more than 7 hours of sleep per night. 82% also indicate that they rarely wake up feeling tired, the highest of all markets surveyed. Even more impressive is Egypt, where 64% of people report good sleep quality – the highest satisfaction rate globally. What’s their secret?The report points to traditional cultural practices and social attitudes that still prioritize rest over round-the-clock productivity. It touches on “sleep shame” in the world of hyper-productivity and says, “Celebrities and business leaders constantly brag about how getting up at the crack of dawn is key to their success. But in reality, are we inadvertently widening the sleep gap? Sleep impacts how we work, and getting the right work-life balance affects how well we sleep. It’s time we celebrate rest and link that to achieving success.” Nations That Struggle With Sleep Perhaps the most unexpected finding is Norway’s poor performance. Despite consistently ranking among the top 10 world’s happiest countries, Norwegians are among the worst sleepers globally, with 56% reporting waking up feeling tired, the highest in the survey. The United States faces similar challenges, with Americans reporting the most disrupted sleep patterns of all surveyed nations.The Japanese get the least sleep with only 6 hours and 10 minutes a night. The Digital Divide Technology emerges as a key factor in these sleep disparities. Globally, 72% of people use their phones in bed – a figure that jumps to an alarming 86% among 18-24 year-olds. This digital dependency shows striking regional variations, with some countries showing higher resistance to bedtime scrolling than others. “With phones, it’s not about the screen or light, it’s the displacement of sleep. People spend almost an extra 40 minutes on their phone before bed. When we’re tired we have lower self-control, and need to move the phone out of the room. Get an alarm clock,” says Dr. Sophie Bostock, founder of The Sleep Scientist. Stress: The Global Sleep Thief While sleep challenges vary by region, some factors are universal. Forty percent of respondents cite stress and overthinking as their primary sleep disruptors. Financial concerns particularly impact rest quality, creating a troubling cycle where economic stress leads to poor sleep, potentially affecting work performance and financial stability. Nineteen percent rely on medication, with five percent using it daily. The Demographics With Lower Sleep Scores Groups with below-average sleep scores | Photo Credit: IKEA.com The study reveals significant sleep inequalities across different groups. Renters, women with young children, the minority community, and those facing financial insecurity consistently score below the global average on the IKEA Sleep Score. These disparities persist across cultures but show varying degrees of severity by region. Couples also sleep better than solo sleepers. The study found that a face-to-face position delivers better sleep quality for couples than back-to-back. Breaking the Cycle While the global sleep gap might seem daunting, experts say small changes can make a big difference. “Sleep is an important factor for life quality,” notes Belén Frau, Global Communication and Positioning Manager at IKEA Retail (Ingka Group). “At IKEA, we’re committed to understanding people’s sleep challenges and providing solutions – whether through smart bedroom designs, better sleep environments, or simple daily habits.” Key Takeaways for Better Sleep IKEA Sleep Report 2025 | Photo Credit: IKEA.com The report also offers practical tips to help everyone sleep better: Stick to a routine: Have regular bedtimes and wake up times, even on weekends. Max out on natural light: Get lots of daylight during the day to help regulate your body clock. Build a sleep sanctuary: Create a clutter-free, cosy space with comfortable bedding and dim lighting. Unwind your mind: Do breathing exercises or meditation to relax. Have good habits: Enjoy rituals, like a hot bath, which can help signal to your brain it’s bedtime. Don’t look at screens: Drift off with audiobooks or podcasts instead. Mind your diet: Avoid heavy meals, caffeine or alcohol near bedtime. Get physical during the day: Regular physical activity promotes better sleep. Don’t force it: Let go of sleep pressure, focus on relaxation instead. Look at the big picture: Aim for consistent, realistic rest rather than perfect nights. This global sleep ranking isn’t just about numbers – it’s a wake-up call to reassess how we approach rest. After all, in our increasingly interconnected world, sleep might be the great equalizer we never knew we needed.",
