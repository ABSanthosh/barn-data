A growing number of 24/7 live radio stations are available online, and the ones on YouTube are quickly becoming my go-to when I want to listen to music. They Provide a More Passive Listening Experience For starters, YouTube's live radio stations give me a passive listening experience. Sure, playlists can also provide that if you find an existing one and press Play, but how many of us really do that? Even with existing playlists, you're still in control, meaning you can skip tracks you don't like, replay songs you do, or fall down the rabbit hole of a particular artist. And that's before you even begin to create your own playlists, which, even with some help from Spotify's AI Playlist tool, requires some brainpower. By contrast, YouTube's 24/7 live radio stations provide a truly passive listening experience. Once I have found one to listen to, simply by typing \"live radio\" into YouTube's search bar, I do not need to do anything. In fact, besides switching to another station altogether or chatting with other listeners (more on that later), I can not do anything but listen, which is bliss. They're Filled With New Songs Rather Than Songs I Know If you're anything like me, your go-to when it comes to picking what playlists to play is a genre or decade you already know you like. This means you'll have already heard most of the songs on that playlist. A new song may occasionally slip in, but generally speaking, you'll be listening to the familiar. This isn't the case with live radio stations, as you're unlikely to have heard most of the songs on them. Plenty of live radio stations are playing oldies and hits, but even more are playing new, obscure, or underground tracks. And if you're actively seeking the unfamiliar, you can simply adjust your search to find a station that hits the spot. They're Perfect for Working or Studying While there are plenty of playlists out there created specifically as background music for working or studying. I find these live radio stations an even better fit for the activity, especially if you can find the right one playing chilled instrumental music that almost fades into the background while you concentrate on your work or studies. I'll open YouTube, find the right station playing songs that provide just the right level of background noise, and then get on with working. And the same applies if you're a student. While it's (almost) as easy to open a streaming service and find a playlist, there's definitely more effort involved. I Can Dip In and Out Without Doing Anything If you're listening to a playlist on a streaming service such as Spotify or Apple Music, you'll likely pause it if you want to go and do something else. This is because you've chosen the playlist for a reason, and likely want to hear every song on it. However, online radio stations are a very different beast. They will continue playing regardless of what you're doing, and I find this very freeing. If I need to make a cup of coffee while working, I just take my headphones off and toddle off to the kitchen. When I get back, I just carry on listening without worrying about what I might have missed. They're Usually Based on a Particular Vibe or Genre These live radio stations on YouTube are rarely filled with a generic mix of music. Instead, the creators try to play songs that all belong to a particular vibe or genre. You can find a live radio station for every possible genre you can think of by adding that to the search. And the same goes for vibes, too. Again, this is obviously also possible with playlists, but due to music streaming services knowing what you do and don't like listening to, it's more difficult to find a completely fresh playlist that hits just the right spot. The algorithm will usually kick in to help you find what it thinks you want to listen to. Whereas that is never the case with online radio stations. The Visuals Can Be Just as Relaxing as the Music If you have reached this point in the article wondering why I have specifically focused on YouTube radio stations rather than audio-only online radio stations, it's because they add another dimension—a visual element, rather unsurprisingly. Unlike the other online radio stations available (of which there are plenty), YouTube's radio stations usually come with visuals attached. This can be anything from a looping animation to stock video footage designed to vibe with the music. But either way, it adds an extra layer. You Can Chat to Like-Minded People (But Don't Have To) Beyond the visuals, there's another reason why I prefer listening to (and watching) these live radio stations on YouTube (as opposed to other sites). And that is the option to chat with other people listening to the station. If you sign in to YouTube, you can chat with other listeners enjoying the same live radio station. This can be a nice distraction in between bursts of productivity for someone like myself, who works at home and in isolation. I Still Love Playlists, But 24/7 Stations Are a Great Alternative Don't get me wrong—I still love listening to playlists. However, this new breed of online radio stations playing 24/7 is providing me with another option, especially when I'm working and want to enjoy a wholly passive listening experience without any need to stay engaged. It should be noted here that there are a multitude of options available if you want to listen to online radio too. As well as YouTube's live radio stations, Apple offers multiple radio stations you can listen to without an Apple Music subscription. Most traditional radio stations also offer online streams, and a great way to explore them is a site called Radio Garden.",

Once I have found one to listen to, simply by typing \u0026#34;live radio\u0026#34; into YouTube\u0026#39;s search bar, I do not need to do anything. In fact, besides switching to another station altogether or chatting with other listeners (more on that later), I can not do anything but listen, which is bliss.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"they-39-re-filled-with-new-songs-rather-than-songs-i-know\"\u003e\n                        They\u0026#39;re Filled With New Songs Rather Than Songs I Know\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re anything like me, your go-to when it comes to picking what playlists to play is a genre or decade you already know you like. This means you\u0026#39;ll have already heard most of the songs on that playlist. A new song may occasionally slip in, but generally speaking, you\u0026#39;ll be listening to the familiar.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThis isn\u0026#39;t the case with live radio stations, as you\u0026#39;re unlikely to have heard most of the songs on them. Plenty of live radio stations are playing oldies and hits, but even more are playing new, obscure, or underground tracks. And if you\u0026#39;re actively seeking the unfamiliar, you can simply adjust your search to find a station that hits the spot.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"they-39-re-perfect-for-working-or-studying\"\u003e\n                        They\u0026#39;re Perfect for Working or Studying\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there are plenty of playlists out there created specifically as background music for working or studying. I find these live radio stations an even better fit for the activity, especially if you can find the right one playing chilled instrumental music that almost fades into the background while you concentrate on your work or studies.\u003c/p\u003e    \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/live-radio-study-music.png\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\"\u003e\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n        \u003cpicture\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/live-radio-study-music.png?q=70\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=1\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/live-radio-study-music.png?q=70\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=1\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/live-radio-study-music.png?q=70\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=1\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/live-radio-study-music.png?q=70\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=1\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 481px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/live-radio-study-music.png?q=70\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=1\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/live-radio-study-music.png?q=70\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=1\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/live-radio-study-music.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/live-radio-study-music.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n                \u003cimg width=\"1309\" height=\"887\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"A live radio station dedicated to music to study to\" data-img-url=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/live-radio-study-music.png\" src=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/live-radio-study-music.png\"/\u003e\n    \u003c/picture\u003e\n                                    \n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;ll open YouTube, find the right station playing songs that provide just the right level of background noise, and then get on with working.
