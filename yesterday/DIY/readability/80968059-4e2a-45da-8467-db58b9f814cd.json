Fortunately, it seems that Google has something in the works. In 2025, the company is planning to allow kids to add their parents' cards to Google Wallet, allowing them to use contactless payments with added parental controls. Google Is Adding Wallet Support to Family Link in 2025 Tada Images / Shutterstock As reported by 9to5Google, Google is working on a way for kids to download the Wallet app through Family Link. Once it's downloaded, the child can normally use the app to make contactless payments with a card. There are a few limitations in place to help parents control their kids' spending. For one, children cannot add a card to their wallet without parental permission first. Once the card is added, the guardian can keep tabs on how their child uses it and can remove it if they're worried about what they see. Also, the cards in Google Wallet cannot be used to make online purchases, so they're restricted to contactless transitions only. The technology already appeared on the Fitbit Ace LTE, and Google noted that it got positive reviews from parents. However, the company will need a little more time to get the same features working on Google Wallet. As such, you'll likely see this feature arrive sometime in 2025. Until then, if the idea of giving your kids a card keeps you up at night, check out these interactive financial websites that teach kids money management skills so they don't blow through their allowance on day one.",

Once it\u0026#39;s downloaded, the child can normally use the app to make contactless payments with a card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a few limitations in place to help parents control their kids\u0026#39; spending. For one, children cannot add a card to their wallet without parental permission first. Once the card is added, the guardian can keep tabs on how their child uses it and can remove it if they\u0026#39;re worried about what they see. Also, the cards in Google Wallet cannot be used to make online purchases, so they\u0026#39;re restricted to contactless transitions only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe technology already appeared on the Fitbit Ace LTE, and Google noted that it got positive reviews from parents. However, the company will need a little more time to get the same features working on Google Wallet. As such, you\u0026#39;ll likely see this feature arrive sometime in 2025.
