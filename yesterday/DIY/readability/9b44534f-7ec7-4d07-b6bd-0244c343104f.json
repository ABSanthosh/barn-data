  "text": "Google Photos Sign in to your MUO account While Google Photos' Memories feature has always been a fun element of the app, sharing those Memories with other people has been a bit of a pain. Until now. Because now, you can edit your Google Photos Memories and share them as video files. In 2019, Google added a Memories feature to its Photos app. Memories is a Stories-like feature that highlights moments from the past, specific days, or photos that all share something in common. Google has sought to make these Memories more shareable over time, realizing that people want to share these moments with their family and friends. However, it has never been all that easy to share photo slideshows outside the app for anyone who doesn't use Google Photos. Now, however, things have changed. As first discovered by Smartdroid, Google Photos now lets you share Memories as video files, removing the need for the recipient to click a link and be whisked to the Google Photos app. Now, if you see a Memory you want to share, you can make some edits before sharing the full photo slideshow as a video file. All you need to do is tap the Share button, and choose Share Memory. You can either then share it as it is, with all the photos included, and the name as the default. Or, click Edit to change the name, and/or remove some of the photos, and/or enable or disable the music playing underneath. Once done, you can share it either in Google Photos, or on any other social media or messaging app you care to mention. And because the Memory is sent as a video file, it's playable immediately. If I'm honest, the ease with which I can share Google Photos Memories with anyone now is only going to have one effect. Which is to make me share them with more people. Even those who aren't likely to be interested in what I was doing on a particular day in January 2021. I have to wonder why it took so long for Google to add the ability to share Photos Memories as video files. I guess the company wanted to force people to use Google Photos instead. Still, it's a nice addition to what is already a fantastic feature.",

Memories feature has always been a fun element of the app, sharing those Memories with other people has been a bit of a pain. Until now. Because now, you can edit your Google Photos Memories and share them as video files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/google-photos-relive-memories/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoogle added a Memories feature to its Photos app\u003c/a\u003e. Memories is a Stories-like feature that highlights moments from the past, specific days, or photos that all share something in common.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGoogle has sought to make these Memories more shareable over time, realizing that people want to share these moments with their family and friends. However, it has never been all that easy to share photo slideshows outside the app for anyone who doesn\u0026#39;t use Google Photos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, however, things have changed. As first discovered by \u003ca href=\"https://www.smartdroid.de/google-fotos-laesst-erinnerungen-jetzt-als-videos-versenden/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSmartdroid\u003c/a\u003e, Google Photos now lets you share Memories as video files, removing the need for the recipient to click a link and be whisked to the Google Photos app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, if you see a Memory you want to share, you can make some edits before sharing the full photo slideshow as a video file. All you need to do is tap the \u003cstrong\u003eShare\u003c/strong\u003e button, and choose \u003cstrong\u003eShare Memory\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can either then share it as it is, with all the photos included, and the name as the default. Or, click \u003cstrong\u003eEdit\u003c/strong\u003e to change the name, and/or \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-remove-images-from-memories-in-google-photos/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eremove some of the photos\u003c/a\u003e, and/or enable or disable the music playing underneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce done, you can share it either in Google Photos, or on any other social media or messaging app you care to mention. And because the Memory is sent as a video file, it\u0026#39;s playable immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf I\u0026#39;m honest, the ease with which I can share Google Photos Memories with anyone now is only going to have one effect. Which is to make me share them with more people. Even those who aren\u0026#39;t likely to be interested in what I was doing on a particular day in January 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have to wonder why it took so long for Google to add the ability to share Photos Memories as video files. I guess the company wanted to force people to \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/should-google-photos-iphone/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003euse Google Photos instead\u003c/a\u003e. Still, it\u0026#39;s a nice addition to what is already a fantastic feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n        \n\n\n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
