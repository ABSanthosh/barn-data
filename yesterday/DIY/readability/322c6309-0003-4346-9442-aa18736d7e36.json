For Sabrina, her search was for the ideal console table.“Unfortunately, I could not find the perfect console, so my husband had to believe in it again and build one himself!” she shared on her Instagram post.After realizing that the perfect entryway console was nowhere to be found, the couple decided to take matters into their own hands rather than settle for a less-than-perfect option. LACKING an Entryway Console Table Materials needed: 2 x IKEA LACK Shelves (110×26 cm) 2 x IKEA LACK Shelves (79×26 cm) Double-headed nails 2 metal braces For their project, the couple went to IKEA and bought two long LACK shelves measuring 110×26 cm and two shorter ones at 79×26 cm. They also got a couple of double-headed nails and flat connectors to ensure a sturdy construction.The assembly process was straightforward. The longer shelves were designated as countertops, while the shorter ones would be transformed into legs. How To Join LACK Shelves Together Photo Credit: Sabrina @sabirella__ | Instagram To begin, they carefully marked the locations on the shorter LACK shelves where the longer ones would be bolted. They drew lines above and below each shelf and identified the midpoint, creating a guide for where the double-headed nails would be inserted.Then, they hammered the double-headed nails into place along the midpoint line, using the tool provided for the task. Once the nails were in position, they centered the longer shelf above and pressed down firmly. “You have to hit it a little harder,” Sabrina explains, highlighting the need for a bit of extra force to ensure a solid connection between the shelves and legs. After attaching the legs, they reinforced the structure by securing the top shelf with flat connectors at the back, enhancing stability. The end result was a sleek yet substantial console table. Paired with a large round mirror, the console table was just what Sabrina needed for her entryway. Share your thoughts in the comments below.
