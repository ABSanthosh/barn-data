What You’ll Need IKEA MÅLA Easel (left, current version; right, old version used in this hack) | IKEA.com 1 IKEA MÅLA easel Chalk spray paint Cricut or similar device Vinyl Flower box or shelf Flowers How to DIY a Wedding Welcome Sign Photo Credit: JULES @jules_creative.jumble | Instagram 1. Prep and Paint the Easel Assemble the easel, but leave off the accessories, like the clips and tray. Jules used an old chalkboard easel from IKEA, which comes with a wooden tray. IKEA US currently features the MÅLA easel, which has a whiteboard on one side and a chalkboard on the other. Lightly sand the entire easel, and spray with the chalk paint. Let it dry thoroughly, adding a second coat if necessary. Follow the instructions for the paint you’re using to determine approximate dry times and how many coats you may need. Jules used Chalk Effect spray paint from COSMOS LAC @Cosmoslac_de, but you could pick up something similar from a local paint or craft store. 2. Add the Vinyl Create the transfers for your sign using your preferred software and cut them from vinyl in the colors of your choice. Ensure the paint on the easel is completely dry before applying the vinyl transfers If you don’t have a Cricut or similar tool (like Silhouette), you could order custom transfers (of course, then you start defeating the purpose of a cost-saving DIY). Another option would be to create a stencil and paint the words onto the sign, or freehand it if you have nice handwriting. Whether painting or using vinyl, choose a font that reflects the style and theme of the wedding. 3. Freshen Up With Flowers Jules joked that the priciest part of this hack was the fresh flowers. She used an older IKEA easel with a flat wooden tray, which turned out to be the perfect spot to display the blooms. However, the current MÅLA easel only has a slim plastic ledge for chalk and similar items. If you plan to include flowers on your sign, you could create your own tray by attaching a slim shelf or flower box. Another option is to use something like the BEKVÄM spice rack (which is only roughly 3 inches shorter than the width of the easel) to the MÅLA easel. More Wedding Sign DIY ideas Undoubtedly, florals are a classic decor element in weddings, but they aren’t the only option. You could use ribbons, fabric banners, tassels, beads, dried elements, or even repurposed items can all add a unique flair that aligns beautifully with your theme. For example, if you’re having a beach wedding, perhaps you can trim your sign with seashells, driftwood pieces, starfish, or even small bottles of sand to bring in that coastal charm. A touch of sea glass or knotted rope can also elevate the nautical vibe. Going with a Bohemian theme? Try incorporating handmade macramé, dried palm leaves, or earth-toned yarn fringe. Adding feathers, wooden beads, or woven textures can lend that free-spirited, artisanal look that defines the boho aesthetic. Hosting a rustic barn wedding? Consider using burlap, lace trims, vintage keys, or small bundles of wheat or lavender tied with twine. Chalkboard paint on wood or distressed whitewashed signs also complement the cozy, homespun vibe perfectly. For a modern or minimalist wedding, less is more. Stick with clean lines, metallic accents (like gold foil or copper tape), acrylic boards, and monochrome color palettes. A vinyl quote in a sleek font paired with a single statement element—like a sprig of greenery or a geometric charm—can look incredibly chic. If you’re leaning into a romantic or garden theme, go for pastel ribbons, trailing vines, silk flowers, or even fairy lights. A sheer overlay with calligraphy can create an ethereal effect, especially when layered over a soft watercolor-painted background. And don’t forget seasonal touches: pinecones or holly for winter weddings, mini pumpkins or autumn leaves for fall, and butterflies or pressed wildflowers for springtime nuptials. That’s what’s so great about DIY projects — you can put your own spin on them to make them the perfect fit for you. Your sign doesn’t just show guests where to go; it’s also an opportunity to share a piece of your story. Follow Jules @jules_creative.jumble for more wedding ideas and design inspiration.

From Curbside Find to Charming DIY Wedding Sign When Sage Ruth was planning her wedding, she wanted a sign to let guests know where to sit—but she didn’t have a concrete plan in mind. That changed when she stumbled upon a dilapidated child’s easel in someone else’s trash. The easel, which turned out to be the MÅLA from IKEA, was covered in chalk and marker, but Sage saw its potential. The biggest transformation came from sawing off the legs, which also removed the tray, helping it look less like a child’s toy and more like a purposeful wedding sign. She then gave it a fresh coat of turquoise paint, repainted the chalkboard surface (which had clearly seen heavy use), and used a chalk pen to hand-letter the seating instructions. The final result? A completely refreshed and repurposed chalkboard sign that looked nothing like its humble beginnings, yet still retained the nostalgic charm of a chalkboard.
