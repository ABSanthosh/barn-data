The Large screen of the iPad Air provides valuable desktop real-estate. The iPad Air offers necessary apps and accessories for efficient light work. I switched to an iPad Air after having been an Android fan for years and using an Android tablet. I’ve never been a fan of Apple’s walled-garden approach. However, after using my iPad Air, I don't think I could go back to an Android tablet. Integrates Seamlessly With my MacBook and iPhone I don’t like how Apple keeps you stuck in its ecosystem, but it does make using all its products together so much easier. I keep an iPhone as my work phone and bought a MacBook Air for working when I travel (although I still use my Windows laptop as my main device), so buying an iPad to replace my aging Android tablet just made sense. Another feature that I like about using the iPad with my iPhone and MacBook is that it syncs the Do Not Disturb status across all devices. Plus, AirDrop makes it a breeze to transfer huge files between devices. Aside from that, since I prefer working with three screens and my MacBook Air only supports one external screen, I use Sidecar to turn my 13-inch M2 iPad Air into a third display. Availability of a Massive Screen for the iPad Air Jowi Morales / MakeUseOf I’ve always loved the desktop real-estate provided by larger displays. That’s why I loved Samsung’s Note smartphones, and all laptops I’ve ever owned had a 15-inch screen. That’s why I was delighted when Apple launched the 13-inch iPad Air for just $799, as I didn’t need to spend the extra $500 to get the 13-inch iPad Pro. Samsung has the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra with its larger 14.6-inch, but this one is priced at $1,200. There’s also the Galaxy Tab S10+, which has a screen size similar to the 13-inch iPad Air, but it was more expensive at $999 when it launched. Although the price on the Samsung website now says $849.99, that’s still $50 more than what Apple offers. I still feel that the 13-inch screen is cramped, especially if I'm working on it all day. However, it provides the perfect balance between screen size and portability, especially as I carry it with me every time I leave the house. It's also a better screen for enjoying movies whenever I fly. Works Great as a Laptop Alternative for Light Work Jowi Morales / MakeUseOf Another reason I bought an iPad was that it is great for light work. I have a more optimized workflow on my Windows PC, and there are some things I can do on my MacBook Air that I cannot on my iPad, but they’re both not as portable as my Apple tablet. So, whenever I go out, I bring my iPad with me, just to ensure that I can get things done in case of an emergency. For example, we once needed to go to the hospital because my wife got scratched by a rusty nail. While we were in the emergency department waiting for some labs and X-rays, I was able to sneak in some work and finish an article on my iPad. Aside from writing, the iPad is also useful for professional photographers. I use it for editing photos on the go, and when I have to set up a studio, I use it as a wireless monitor. This allows me and my clients to see the images I take on a larger screen instead of relying on the tiny display of my camera. Has All the Apps I Need Jowi Morales / MakeUseOf One of the reasons why iPads are ahead of Android tablets is the number of well-thought-out apps you can find on the App Store, as well as the typically longer software support that Apple gives its products. For example, Adobe Lightroom, which I use for editing photos, arrived earlier on the iPad than on Android devices. All the apps I use for work are also readily available on the App Store and usually work better on iPadOS, even though they’re not Apple software. So, even though the apps I mainly use—Microsoft 365, OneDrive, Google Drive, Asana, Trello, and Slack—aren’t developed by Apple, they still play nice with the iPad. This means I can seamlessly switch between my iPad, MacBook Air, Windows PC, iPhone, and even Samsung phone without having to worry about manually transferring things. Accessories Make Productivity Easier Jowi Morales / MakeUseOf Aside from its large screen, the other thing that I love about the iPad Air is its USB-C port. This means I don’t have to get a proprietary cable to connect accessories and charge the device, unlike my iPhone 14. Furthermore, my iPad has a USB 3.2 Gen 2x1 port, meaning I can transfer data at up to 10 Gbps. Because of this, I can easily attach a USB Hub to the tablet, like this Baseus Metal Gleam Series II I reviewed, and add several accessories to it to make working easier. That means I can easily attach an external drive, especially when I’m working with large files, and even use a wired mechanical keyboard if I’m in the mood for writing. I even bought an iPad keyboard case that’s right for me. It lets me pull out my tablet from my bag and start writing or editing photos ergonomically anytime. If you don’t want to pay a premium for Apple accessories, there are also many cheaper alternatives to the Magic Keyboard that are just as good. These are some reasons why I finally switched to the iPad Air after several years of owning an Android tablet and sticking to Android devices. While Samsung’s giant Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is a tempting offer, I ultimately found better value in the 13-inch M2 iPad Air, and I’m perfectly satisfied with this device.",

I’ve always loved the desktop real-estate provided by larger displays. That’s why I loved Samsung’s Note smartphones, and all laptops I’ve ever owned had a 15-inch screen. That’s why I was delighted when Apple launched the 13-inch iPad Air for just $799, as I didn’t need to spend the extra $500 to get the 13-inch iPad Pro.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSamsung has the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra with its larger 14.6-inch, but this one is priced at $1,200. There’s also the Galaxy Tab S10+, which has a screen size similar to the 13-inch iPad Air, but it was more expensive at $999 when it launched. Although the price on the Samsung website now says $849.99, that’s still $50 more than what Apple offers.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eI still feel that the 13-inch screen is cramped, especially if I\u0026#39;m working on it all day. However, it provides the perfect balance between screen size and portability, especially as I carry it with me every time I leave the house. It\u0026#39;s also a better screen for enjoying movies whenever I fly.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"works-great-as-a-laptop-alternative-for-light-work\"\u003e\n                        Works Great as

bought an iPad was that it is great for light work. I have a more optimized workflow on my Windows PC, and there are some things I can do on my MacBook Air that I cannot on my iPad, but they’re both not as portable as my Apple tablet. So, whenever I go out, I bring my iPad with me, just to ensure that I can get things done in case of an emergency.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFor example, we once needed to go to the hospital because my wife got scratched by a rusty nail. While we were in the emergency department waiting for some labs and X-rays, I was able to sneak in some work and finish an article on my iPad.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAside from writing, the iPad is also useful for professional photographers. I use it for editing photos on the go, and when I have to set up a studio, I use it as a wireless monitor. This allows me and my clients to see the images I take on a larger screen instead of relying on the tiny display of my camera.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"has-all-the-apps-i-need\"\u003e\n

ahead of Android tablets is the number of well-thought-out apps you can find on the App Store, as well as the typically longer software support that Apple gives its products. For example, Adobe Lightroom, which I use for editing photos, arrived earlier on the iPad than on Android devices. All the apps I use for work are also readily available on the App Store and usually work better on iPadOS, even though they’re not Apple software.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSo, even though the apps I mainly use—Microsoft 365, OneDrive, Google Drive, Asana, Trello, and Slack—aren’t developed by Apple, they still play nice with the iPad. This means I can seamlessly switch between my iPad, MacBook Air, Windows PC, iPhone, and even Samsung phone without having to worry about manually transferring things.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2

\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e Aside from its large screen, the other thing that I love about the iPad Air is its USB-C port. This means I don’t have to get a proprietary cable to connect accessories and charge the device, unlike my iPhone 14. Furthermore, my iPad has a USB 3.2 Gen 2x1 port, meaning I can transfer data at up to 10 Gbps.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eBecause of this, I can easily attach a USB Hub to the tablet, like this \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/baseus-metal-gleam-series-ii-10-in-1-usb-hub-review/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBaseus Metal Gleam Series II I reviewed\u003c/a\u003e, and add several accessories to it to make working easier.

While Samsung’s giant Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is a tempting offer, I ultimately found better value in the 13-inch M2 iPad Air, and I’m perfectly satisfied with this device.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
