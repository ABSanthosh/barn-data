However, even if I'm not actively using an old device and it's just gathering dust, I still like to keep it registered on \"Find My Device\" for the reasons below. 1 I Can Track and Recover My Devices One of the main reasons I never remove any of my old devices from \"Find My Device\" is for tracking and recovery purposes. Even if I'm not using some of these devices regularly, they still serve as backup options or are passed on to family members. As a result, my old devices sometimes end up in unexpected places—like a forgotten drawer at the office or left behind at a friend's house. Being able to locate my devices remotely spares me the hassle of retracing my steps or guessing where they might be. It's a bit of extra insurance that costs me nothing and has saved me more than once from permanently losing a device. 2 I Can Remotely Lock My Device and Wipe Data Gorodenkoff/Shutterstock In case one of my devices gets stolen or lost, having it registered with \"Find My Device\" allows me to remotely lock it down immediately. This feature helps me prevent unauthorized access by setting a passcode or locking the screen, even if I no longer have the device physically. If I believe it's lost and not stolen, I can also display a custom message on the screen with contact information for its return, all while keeping the rest of my data safe. If things take a turn for the worse—like if I'm convinced the device is truly gone for good—I can take it a step further and erase all of the data remotely. This is a lifesaver, especially considering how much personal and sensitive information we store on our devices these days. This way, even if someone manages to access the device, they won't have access to my photos, documents, or account logins. They won't even be able to answer calls, read any notifications, or steal my identity in any way. That level of protection helps me sleep better at night. 3 It Maintains Activation Lock for Security DALL-E/MakeUseOf Keeping my old Apple devices in \"Find My\" also helps maintain iCloud's Activation Lock, which is a crucial security feature. Likewise, removing my old Android phone or tablet from \"Find My Device\" by removing the Google account also disables FRP (Factory Reset Protection). For this reason, I find it best not to remove the device from my account even if it's lost and I've erased it remotely. The security features I mentioned above stay active as long as the device remains linked to my account. As a result, even if someone gets hold of my device, they can't simply wipe it and repurpose or resell it without entering my credentials. 4 It Retains Access to IMEI for Recovery Reezky Pradata/Shutterstock The IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number is a unique identifier for every mobile device, and it can be incredibly useful in recovery situations. Keeping my old devices listed in the \"Find My Devices\" list gives me a central and easily accessible place to retrieve critical information like the IMEI. Having the IMEI on hand is a huge advantage if my phone is ever lost. Reporting the IMEI to authorities or my mobile carrier can help blacklist the device, making it harder for anyone to use it on any network. Without \"Find My Device,\" I'd have to dig through old paperwork or linked devices to find this number—which isn't always practical. Knowing I have a reliable method to locate and secure my devices gives me peace of mind, especially considering the sensitive information they often contain. Furthermore, there are no significant downsides to keeping them listed, which is why I firmly believe that keeping my old devices on \"Find My Device\" is a wise decision.",
