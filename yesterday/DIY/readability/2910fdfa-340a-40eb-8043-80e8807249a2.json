NordVPN can rightfully claim it's part of the minority, as an independent auditor has confirmed its no-logs claim for the fifth year running. NordVPN Passes Its No-Logs Audit for a Fifth Year As announced by NordVPN, the company has been under the microscope to see if its practices match its statements regarding its no-logs policy. NordVPN brought on Deloitte Audit Lithuania, an auditing company that had access to the company's services for a month in late 2024: During this period, it evaluated the systems and then provided insights. Deloitte conducted the assessment in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) (ISAE 3000), established by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) with the aim of examining NordVPN’s IT system configuration and management. Sure enough, Deloitte returned with the same result it has given for the past five years. NordVPN does not keep logs, and its claims match its practices. Proving a no-log claim is very important for the privacy-minded. If a VPN claims to never save logs but does (deliberately or accidentally), it can mean serious ramifications for people who use VPNs to protect themselves from government censorship. As such, this audit means people can use NordVPN without fear of someone uncovering their web usage. Related NordVPN's New Identity Protection Tool Will Protect You, and Pays You If It Doesn't NordProtect is offering up to $1 million of compensation for people affected by identity theft. If you're interested in using the service, visit the NordVPN website and check out their plans. If you need a little convincing, we've tried NordVPN's free remote connection tool and found it really useful. When we compared NordVPN to ExpressVPN, it took the crown, becoming our best overall VPN of 2024.",
