If you’re wondering when it’s time to upgrade your iPad, here’s how I decide when to make the switch. 1 Your iPad Doesn’t Support the Latest iPadOS Version All operating systems get upgrades semi-regularly to provide security patches, add new features, and sometimes remove old features. Apple’s iPadOS is no different. If your iPad is too old for the latest version of iPadOS, you could be missing vital security patches and handy features. iPadOS 18 offers tons of amazing features, but if you own an older model like an iPad (6th generation), you’ll be limited to iPadOS 17. While Apple continues to provide occasional security updates for older versions, not receiving major updates is a clear signal that it might be time to upgrade. Over time, you’ll also start missing out on newer apps that are incompatible with older operating systems. If you’re unsure whether your iPad supports the latest iPadOS, you can check the list of devices compatible with iPadOS 18. If you also don’t know which iPad you have, our guide can help. 2 You Can't Use Multiple Apps at the Same Time Apple markets the iPad as a true laptop replacement, so it’s important that your device handles multitasking smoothly. While there are plenty of ways to multitask efficiently on iPad, older models often struggle with performance. Most older iPads have just 1–3GB of RAM, which isn’t ideal for tasks like schoolwork or professional use. If your iPad frequently closes apps in the background or feels sluggish when running multiple apps, it’s probably time to consider an upgrade. However, if you mainly use your iPad for simpler activities like streaming Netflix and everything runs well, there’s no rush to upgrade. Stick with your current device as long as it meets your needs. 3 Your iPad Runs Out of Space Constantly Another sign you’re ready for a new iPad is running out of storage regularly. Running up against your storage limit once or twice is par for the course in some ways, but if it happens more often, you may have an issue. While you can’t expand iPad storage (as you can with some Android tablets), you have plenty of cloud storage solutions. For instance, once you pick the right iCloud plan, you can store your photos, videos, files, and more in the cloud, making them accessible from any device. However, cloud storage has its limitations. You’ll need an internet connection to access your files, and apps will still take up a significant amount of space on your iPad. If you frequently use large apps or play games and keep running out of storage, upgrading to an iPad with more storage might be your only solution. If space is a concern and the usual tips to clear your iPad storage haven’t helped, it’s definitely time to get a new iPad. Apple tends to bump the internal storage options with new generations. For example, the base iPad (10th generation) starts with 64GB of storage, and you can spec an iPad Pro up to 2TB, which should be more than enough for anything you plan to do on an iPad. 4 New iPad Accessories Are Incompatible Hamlin Rozario/MakeUseOf If you use your iPad as your primary computer, upgrading to a newer model can be worth it just for the improved accessories. For example, if you rely on the first-generation Apple Pencil for a lot of sketching or drawing, upgrading to a model that supports the Apple Pencil Pro is absolutely worth it, since it offers tons of upgrades that artists will love. Keyboards and cases are another reason to consider an upgrade. Older iPads only support the Smart Keyboard Folio, which lacks a trackpad. Newer iPads are compatible with the Magic Keyboard, which includes a built-in trackpad and another USB-C port, making the iPad feel much more like a laptop replacement. However, keep in mind that the Magic Keyboard can be a bit expensive, especially when paired with a new iPad. Even if you're looking for basic cases, there is no guarantee you will find good ones for an older iPad. While you could scour eBay and Amazon for suitable accessories, it may be time to bite the bullet and upgrade. 5 Poor Battery Performance Aryan Surendranath/MakeUseOf All iPads ship with a rechargeable lithium-ion battery that offers a considerable lifespan. But if you have any experience with smartphones, you’ll know that the battery doesn’t last so long after years of usage. Lithium-ion batteries degrade over time; each battery has a finite number of charge cycles. So the older the device, the more cycles it has gone through. Extremely hot and cold temperatures can also negatively affect batteries, as can fully discharging the cell regularly. So how long do new iPad batteries last under typical use? Most iPads can easily last a full day with basic tasks like web browsing on Wi-Fi or watching videos. If your iPad’s battery isn’t holding up and falls far short of this, it might be time to consider an upgrade. To get a clearer picture of your battery’s condition, you can check the battery health on your iPad—this can help you decide whether an upgrade is necessary. If your budget doesn’t allow it, for the time being, consider an iPad battery replacement. This will set you back anywhere from $99 to $199, depending on which iPad you have. With such good reasons to upgrade your iPad, you might be happy to forget your old one. But you shouldn’t throw it out it just yet—you’ll find that it still has some use. You can repurpose your older iPad for other tasks, such as using it as an ebook reader. If you don’t plan to give it away, remember that selling your old iPad is also an excellent option, especially if you’ve kept it in good condition. That’s a great way to get back some of the hard-earned money you spent on your new iPad.",

You’ll need an internet connection to access your files, and apps will still take up a significant amount of space on your iPad. If you frequently use large apps or play games and keep running out of storage, upgrading to an iPad with more storage might be your only solution.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf space is a concern and the usual \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-storage-full-create-free-space-ios/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etips to clear your iPad storage\u003c/a\u003e haven’t helped, it’s definitely time to get a new iPad. Apple tends to bump the internal storage options with new generations.

your iPad as your primary computer, upgrading to a newer model can be worth it just for the improved accessories.

Older iPads only support the Smart Keyboard Folio, which lacks a trackpad.
