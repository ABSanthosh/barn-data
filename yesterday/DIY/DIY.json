    "description": "There's an ongoing debate about whether or not it's safe or even desirable to rinse meat before cooking it. Many fall into the anti-rinsing camp, saying that it's not effective at dislodging bacteria, especially on poultry, as we've discussed before. Meanwhile, some argue that rinsing certain meats, like bacon, can rinse away excess surface salt and may reduce shrinkage — though evidence is strictly anecdotal. Washing meat with a gentle acid: a cultural practice, not a safety guaranteeIn many West Indian and Caribbean kitchens, it's a common practice to rinse chicken and fish with a mild acid like lemon, lime, or vinegar prior to cooking. For example, Haitian stewed chicken (poule en sauce) is prepared by washing the chicken with sour orange juice or vinegar before cooking. Cooks say it freshens the smell, removes surface slime, and adds subtle tang.

    "description": "Sushi rolls, known as makizushi in Japanese, are only limited by your imagination — and your ability to roll them neatly, of course. While it may seem like a lot of effort, rolling sushi is a snap if you have the right tools. If you plan on making sushi rolls a lot at home, a bamboo mat is the way to go, but a tea towel — or even just your bare hands — will work if you only want to make them occasionally. No matter which tool you end up using, the method for rolling sushi is the same. Using a traditional bamboo matFor this demonstration, I'm making kimbap, a Korean roll that contains tamago, spinach, burdock root, and pickled daikon radish. Lay out your bamboo mat with an optional piece of plastic wrap on top (to keep the mat clean). Make sure that the dried seaweed (nori) has its rough side facing upward. (If you're feeling adventurous, you could also use a sheet of sriracha sauce instead of nori.) Evenly spread rice over the nori while leaving space at the top and bottom of the...more",
