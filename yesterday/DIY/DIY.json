    "description": "Apple Notes may not have all the bells and whistles that a more powerful word processor like Apple Pages has, but this simple text editor has plenty of helpful features that make it more than just a basic note-taking app. One of these features gives you the ability to highlight text and change font colors, giving you another way to make important details stand out. To highlight text in your notes, your iPhone, iPad, or Mac needs to be running at least iOS 18, iPadOS 18, or macOS Sequoia 15, respectively. Highlighting in Notes is not yet compatible with the iCloud.com version of the app. That means you won't even be able to see highlighted notes on iCloud.com (so don't freak out if some of your highlights aren't appearing in the web app).

    "description": "The iOS 18.5 update is now out for iPhones, landing on May 12 with a tidy bundle of convenience tweaks sprinkled across Apple's core apps and settings. It isn't a headline‑grabbing release like last time, but the update still shaves steps off everyday tasks, surfaces helpful info where you need it, and quietly prepares your device for what's coming next. Mail finally gets an in‑app switch for Contact Photos, so you can toggle avatars without diving into Settings, while Back Tap once again flashes a confirmation banner to let you know your double‑ or triple‑tap was recognized. A fresh Pride wallpaper joins the collection just in time for Pride Month, and the TV app's new \"Buy with iPhone\" option makes it easier to purchase movies or shows on third‑party streaming devices using Face ID. Apple has also reorganized its AppleCare \u0026 Warranty section and mirrored coverage details in the Apple Account pane, added carrier‑powered satellite tools for the...more",
