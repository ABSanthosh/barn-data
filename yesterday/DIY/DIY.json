    "link": "https://apple.gadgethacks.com/news/unreleased-apple-intelligence-features/",
    "description": "Apple Intelligence has followed a predictable path so far, bringing plenty of AI features designed for everyday users. But even with new AI updates in every iOS release since iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1, there's still plenty of room for growth — especially in generative AI (gen AI). And Apple seems to be leaning into that, as shown by its recent updates enabling Apple Intelligence by default and expanding language support. We've seen fun image generation features like Genmoji and Image Wand alongside practical AI-powered features like text summarization, Writing Tools, and ChatGPT integration. Siri, in particular, has already gained several notable Apple Intelligence upgrades on supported devices: A new glowing edge animation ensures Siri doesn't interrupt what you're doing in apps.

    "link": "https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/free-up-storage-space-iphone/",
    "description": "Although your iPhone does not offer an option to upgrade internal storage space using a memory card, as some Android phones do, there are plenty of things you can do to clear up storage so you can put everything you want on your device and stop getting those Storage Almost Full alerts. You may not be able to insert a microSD card into your iPhone, but you can purchase external storage solutions such as portable Lightning or USB-C drives, which I'll get into below. Aside from external storage options, one of the first things you can do is keep your iOS device updated at all times. Having the latest update allows you to access all the latest features while maintaining optimal performance. However, you won't be able to install the latest update if your iPhone doesn't have enough storage space to download it, a common problem iOS users face. To make room for iOS updates, prevent Storage Almost Full warnings, or just keep things working smoothly, try applying some of the tips below to...more",
