    "description": "Apple's iOS 18.4 update for iPhone is finally available, and it brings some exciting new tools, smart refinements, and deeper Apple Intelligence integration that make your iPhone experience even better. Whether you're looking for ways to stay more organized, enhance your daily workflow, or enjoy new forms of entertainment, this update has something for everyone. Apple Intelligence continues to evolve, with new ways to streamline notifications and help you focus on what truly matters.

    "description": "If you're in the US, your iPhone lets you set default apps for emailing, messaging, calling, web browsing, and even contactless payments and access. With iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4, Apple also lets you pick a new default translation app. Out of the box, your iPhone or iPad is preconfigured to use Apple's Translate app to translate text and speech into different languages. But you will be able to change it to a third-party option like Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, iTranslate, and Translate Now. Since iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 were just released on March 31, not all translation apps will immediately be available as a default option. Developers must update their apps to support this feature by adding specific system permissions and integration features.
