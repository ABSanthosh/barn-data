    "description": "Flagship earbuds like Apple's AirPods Pro, Sony's WF‑1000XM5, Jabra's Elite 10, and Soundcore's Liberty 4 Pro sound fantastic, but they come with equally premium price tags. Luckily, there are plenty of stellar alternatives that won't gut your wallet. Spend less than $100, and you can still land punchy audio, rock‑solid active noise canceling (ANC), and marathon battery life without feeling like you settled. Below, we start with our overall winner and count down to number five, covering specs, pros and cons, and the exclusive, standout features that separate each pair from the pack. Each model stands out for different strengths, so you can zero in on the perfect balance of price and performance without sacrificing the features that matter most to you.

In short, they'll likely make headsets more expensive, slow down production, and force some serious changes in how these devices are made and sold. What you need to know: VR and tariffsNew tariffs are already active — The US raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 245%, and China responded with 84% tariffs on US goods. Most countries are affected, not just China. Headsets are about to get pricier — Components for VR/AR devices are heavily globalized, and tariffs will likely drive up production costs and retail prices.
