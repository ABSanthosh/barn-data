    "description": "Lasagna, that layered, creamy baked pasta dish, is a lovely comfort food that's great for a crowd. But if you've ever made it, you know you're usually left with some leftover lasagna noodles. (Although that's always better than the frustration of running out of noodles while you're still making a traditional lasagna.) Still, what do you do when you're left with a bowlful of the wide ribbons? Guess what? There's no rule that you can only use lasagna noodles to make a layered pasta dish.
