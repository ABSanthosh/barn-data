    "link": "https://apple.gadgethacks.com/how-to/pinned-tabs-safari/",
    "description": "Pinned tabs in Safari lock your most-frequented sites to the very top of each Tab Group, so the pages you rely on are never more than two quick taps away. Whether you juggle dozens of tabs at work, plan a vacation in a dedicated group, or jump between personal and professional Safari profiles, pins keep your most important websites front and center. While you could pin tabs in Safari on macOS since 2015, pinning tabs wasn't possible on iPhone and iPad until the Safari 16 update came with iOS 16 and iPadOS 16. Combined with Tab Groups, tab pinning is the easiest way to create topic‑specific \"bookmarks\" that live inside the browsing context you're already using. Add Safari profiles into the mix, and you have a three‑layer system (Profiles → Tab Groups → Pins) that can keep even the busiest browser beautifully organized. Don't Miss: How to Create, Use, and Manage Tab Groups in Safari on Your iPhone Below, you'll find everything you need to know about pinning, including every pinning...more",

    "description": "Streaming is great until you're 30,000 feet up, riding the subway, or stuck on a network that suddenly drops to dial-up-slow speeds. That's why Amazon's offline access remains one of Prime Video's best perks. Amazon introduced mobile downloads back in 2015, beating Netflix and Hulu to the punch, and the workflow hasn't changed much since. Today, if you're a paying Prime or Prime Video subscriber (or part of a paying family account), you can stash almost any title on your iPhone or Android phone before you lose service — whether it's a darkly decadent thriller like \"Saltburn\" or buzzy originals such as \"The Boys,\" \"Reacher,\" \"Fallout,\" or \"The Rings of Power.\" Offline downloads deliver two key benefits: instant access to full-resolution video wherever you are and zero hits to your data plan or flaky airport Wi-Fi. Nearly the entire Prime catalog is fair game for downloads; the only real holdouts are free, ad-supported videos and titles blocked on kids' profiles by parental-control...more",
