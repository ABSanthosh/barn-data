    "link": "https://apple.gadgethacks.com/how-to/apple-ambient-music-app/",
    "description": "With iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4, Apple introduces a new Ambient Music feature designed to enhance user well-being through curated soundscapes. This feature offers four distinct categories — Chill, Productivity, Sleep, and Wellbeing — each providing a tailored auditory experience to suit various moods and activities. While iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 won't be released to the general public until April, you can test the new Ambient Music app as a beta user if you're comfortable running beta software on your devices. Currently, the Ambient Music app cannot be found on the Home Screen, in the App Library, or via Spotlight Search, and there are no actions for it yet in the Shortcuts app. Instead, you need to add one or more Ambient Music controls to your Control Center to use the app. You can also replace the two shortcuts for Flashlight and Camera on the Lock Screen with Ambient Music controls.

    "description": "Apple's iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 have been out since September, but more features are coming, such as new emoji from Unicode 16, and you can test them after installing a beta build for iOS 18.4 or iPadOS 18.4. Apple Intelligence debuted on iOS and iPadOS 18.1 and expanded on iOS and iPadOS 18.2 and iOS and iPadOS 18.3, but iOS and iPadOS 18.4 improve upon them even more. There are also new features and changes beyond Apple Intelligence you'll want to try out, such as Ambient Music and Apple News+ Food. The iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 betas were first available to registered developers on June 10 and to Apple Beta Software Program users on July 15. While stable iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 versions were released to everyone on Sept. 16, Apple continues beta testing 18.x versions. iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 were released on Oct. 28. iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2 were released on Dec. 11. iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3 were released on Jan. 27. iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 are currently in testing.
