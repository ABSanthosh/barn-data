    "description": "Your iPhone can already send messages with your voice, reply with a tap, and suggest words while you type. Now, with iOS 18.4, it can instantly launch a specific conversation from virtually anywhere on your device. Thanks to a new action in the Shortcuts app, you're just one tap (or Back Tap) away from texting your favorite contact. Apple introduced the new Open Conversation action in iOS 18.4, and it's also backward compatible with at least iOS 18.3.1. Whether you're setting it up for speed, accessibility, or just pure convenience, it's one of the most useful Shortcuts updates in recent memory. Here's how to create a shortcut that launches your most-used Messages threads — and how to run it from your Home Screen, Lock Screen, Action button, Back Tap, Control Center, or anywhere else Shortcuts can live. This is the most basic shortcut you can create, but you can add to it to create even more useful workflows. RequirementsiPhone or iPad running iOS 18.4 or iPadOS 18.4 or later...more",

    "description": "A crucial part of the system that keeps your iPhone, iPad, Android device, and computer secure just lost US government funding — and the ripple effects could soon reach your gadget's next update. A quiet but major shake-up in cybersecurityThe US government has abruptly cut off funding to the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program, the global system standardizing how software and hardware vulnerabilities are cataloged and tracked. If you've ever looked at Apple's or Google's lists of security updates, you'd know that many of the security flaws patched are thanks to CVE tracking and reporting. For example, Apple's iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 security release included at least 60 component patches tied to 65 CVE-tracked vulnerabilities — plus more than 30 other fixes not assigned a CVE. Without this backbone of cybersecurity coordination, updates could slow down, become less transparent, or sometimes miss key vulnerabilities altogether. But there's already a plan to prevent...more",
