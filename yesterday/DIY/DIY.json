    "link": "https://ios.gadgethacks.com/news/ios-18.3-features/",
    "description": "Apple just released iOS 18.3, its latest software update for iPhone, on January 27 — after 42 days of beta testing. While it's not as feature-packed as the previous updates for iOS 18.2 and iOS 18.1 were, there are still a few important changes you'll want to know about. Aside from the return of a critical Calculator feature, most of the changes in iOS 18.3 apply to iPhone models that support Apple Intelligence. Those would be the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and all iPhone 16 models. The new emoji from Unicode 16 are also missing from this update but are expected to arrive with iOS 18.4. Note: Many of these features and changes also apply to iPads running iPadOS 18.3 and Macs running macOS Sequoia 15.3. New Unity Rhythm WallpapersIncluded in the update are new wallpapers for Apple’s Black Unity Collection. Apple today [Jan. 27] unveiled a new Black Unity Collection to honor Black History Month, and celebrate Black culture and community. Inspired by the rhythm of humanity, the...more",

    "description": "Apple's iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 have been out since September, but more features are coming, such as new emoji from Unicode 16, and you can test them after installing a beta build for iOS 18.4 or iPadOS 18.4. Apple Intelligence debuted on iOS and iPadOS 18.1 and expanded on iOS and iPadOS 18.2 and iOS and iPadOS 18.3, but iOS and iPadOS 18.4 will likely improve Apple Intelligence features even more. But there will also likely be new features and changes beyond Apple Intelligence you'll want to try out. The iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 betas were first available to registered developers on June 10 and to Apple Beta Software Program users on July 15. While stable iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 versions were released to everyone on Sept. 16, Apple continues beta testing 18.x versions. iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 were released on Oct. 28. iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2 were released on Dec. 11. iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3 were released on Jan. 27. iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 are approaching the initial beta build.
