    "description": "Streaming is great until you're 30,000 feet up, riding the subway, or stuck on a network that suddenly drops to dial-up-slow speeds. That's why Amazon's offline access remains one of Prime Video's best perks. Amazon introduced mobile downloads back in 2015, beating Netflix and Hulu to the punch, and the workflow hasn't changed much since. Today, if you're a paying Prime or Prime Video subscriber (or part of a paying family account), you can stash almost any title on your iPhone or Android phone before you lose service — whether it's a darkly decadent thriller like \"Saltburn\" or buzzy originals such as \"The Boys,\" \"Reacher,\" \"Fallout,\" or \"The Rings of Power.\" Offline downloads deliver two key benefits: instant access to full-resolution video wherever you are and zero hits to your data plan or flaky airport Wi-Fi. Nearly the entire Prime catalog is fair game for downloads; the only real holdouts are free, ad-supported videos and titles blocked on kids' profiles by parental-control...more",

    "description": "Over time, your Android phone or tablet has likely connected to dozens of Wi-Fi networks — and it remembers every single one. Whether it's a hotspot at home, school, work, the gym, a coffee shop, a relative's apartment — or even from a friend's phone — each time you type in a Wi-Fi password, your Android device saves it for safekeeping and easy access later. The trouble comes when you want to actually see the password for one of the networks you've connected to before. Perhaps you want to connect a second device to a saved wireless access point, or maybe you're with a friend who wants to log in to the same hotspot. If you can't get the password from the source, you might think to check your Android phone or tablet for the credentials — but looking at the stored Wi-Fi network in your settings won't always show the password in plain text, depending on your device, Android version, and/or Android skin.
