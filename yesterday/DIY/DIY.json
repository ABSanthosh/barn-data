    "link": "https://ios.gadgethacks.com/news/ios-18.5-features/",
    "description": "Apple's iOS 18.5 update may be lighter on headline features than its predecessor, but it still brings a few quality-of-life upgrades and behind-the-scenes enhancements that make using your iPhone just a bit smoother. It's a smaller release, but if you dig into the details, you'll find thoughtful refinements across core apps and settings that help simplify tasks and give you more control. From quick access settings in Mail to faster recovery options in Photos, iOS 18.5 trims a few extra steps from your daily workflow.

    "description": "Apple's first iOS 18.5 beta has introduced a new localization string that suggests the company is preparing support for \"5G Advanced,\" the next evolution of cellular technology. Specifically, the beta includes a new \"status.network.5ga\" = \"5G Advanced\" string, which could point to upcoming system-level support for showing a 5G Advanced label in the iPhone status bar or settings. Joining that string are ones for 5G, 5G+, 5G Evolution (E), 5G Ultra Capacity (UC), 5G Ultra Wideband (UW), LTE, 4G, 3G, Edge (E), and GPRS (G), all supported on iPhone already with their own status bar icons. It hints that Apple is preparing to support 5G Advanced (5G-A) cellular technology based on 3GPP Release 18 standards in a future software or hardware update. What is 5G Advanced?5G Advanced (3GPP Release 18), often described as 5.5G, introduces smarter and more adaptable network capabilities.
