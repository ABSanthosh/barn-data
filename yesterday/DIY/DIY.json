    "link": "https://ios.gadgethacks.com/news/ios-18.5-features/",
    "description": "Apple's iOS 18.5 update may be lighter on headline features than its predecessor, but it still brings a few quality-of-life upgrades and behind-the-scenes enhancements that make using your iPhone just a bit smoother. It's a smaller release, but if you dig into the details, you'll find thoughtful refinements across core apps and settings that help simplify tasks and give you more control. From quick access settings in Mail to faster recovery options in Photos, iOS 18.5 trims a few extra steps from your daily workflow. AppleCare \u0026 Warranty details have also been reorganized, and the Back Tap detection banner returns after disappearing in iOS 18.4.

    "description": "Why are there no official Star Wars emoji in the Unicode Standard? We've got the Vulcan Salute from Star Trek, so where's the force choke hand gesture?! While you may never see Star Wars officially invade your emoji keyboard, there are ways to send Star Wars emoji and stickers to your friends in your favorite chat app. What are Star Wars emoji?First, before you start spamming your conversations with Baby Yoda and Darth Vader, know that none of these are official emoji. Actual emoji on your device's keyboard are part of the Unicode Standard, which receives updates frequently. For instance, Apple pushed out its latest emoji update with iOS 18.4. However, just because the Star Wars emoji in this guide aren't official emoji doesn't mean they aren't technically emoji. According to Unicode, emoji are simply \"picture characters,\" and \"emoji\" literally translates to \"picture\" and \"written character\" from Japanese, where they originated.
