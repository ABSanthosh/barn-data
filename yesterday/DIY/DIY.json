    "link": "https://ios.gadgethacks.com/news/ios-18.5-features/",
    "description": "The iOS 18.5 update is now out for iPhones, landing on May 12 with a tidy bundle of convenience tweaks sprinkled across Apple's core apps and settings. It isn't a headline‑grabbing release like last time, but the update still shaves steps off everyday tasks, surfaces helpful info where you need it, and quietly prepares your device for what's coming next. Mail finally gets an in‑app switch for Contact Photos, so you can toggle avatars without diving into Settings, while Back Tap once again flashes a confirmation banner to let you know your double‑ or triple‑tap was recognized. A fresh Pride wallpaper joins the collection just in time for Pride Month, and the TV app's new \"Buy with iPhone\" option makes it easier to purchase movies or shows on third‑party streaming devices using Face ID.

    "link": "https://ios.gadgethacks.com/news/ios-18-5-5g-advanced-support/",
    "description": "Apple's iOS 18.5's code has introduced a new localization string that suggests the company is preparing support for \"5G Advanced,\" the next evolution of cellular technology. Specifically, the code includes a new \"status.network.5ga\" = \"5G Advanced\" string, which could point to upcoming system-level support for showing a 5G Advanced label in the iPhone status bar or settings. Joining that string are ones for 5G, 5G+, 5G Evolution (E), 5G Ultra Capacity (UC), 5G Ultra Wideband (UW), LTE, 4G, 3G, Edge (E), and GPRS (G), all supported on iPhone already with their own status bar icons. It hints that Apple is preparing to support 5G Advanced (5G-A) cellular technology based on 3GPP Release 18 standards in a future software or hardware update. What is 5G Advanced?5G Advanced (3GPP Release 18), often described as 5.5G, introduces smarter and more adaptable network capabilities.
