    "description": "One of the most significant changes to iPhone that came with iOS 18 lets you text Android users in the Messages app with iMessage-like features such as typing indicators, read receipts, large file sharing, high-quality photos and videos, and even emoji reactions. Introduced in 2012, RCS, or Rich Communication Services, is a communication protocol that will one day replace SMS and MMS text messaging. It's been available globally to Android users since 2020 in the Google Messages app. Wireless carriers first implemented RCS into their own Android apps, but Google Messages is now the standard across networks. Apple announced in late 2023 that it would support RCS messaging, and it's official on iPhones as of Sept. 16, 2024, with the release of iOS 18. So, you can finally take advantage of more advanced features when texting your Android friends. RCS messaging also works on other Apple devices with Text Message Forwarding turned on, such as an iPad, Mac, or another iPhone. Don't Miss: 18...more",

    "description": "Apple is expanding its Food topic in Apple News into a full-blown section with recipes, restaurant reviews, kitchen tips, and more with the upcoming iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 software updates. The new Food section will be exclusive to Apple News+ subscribers, but nonsubscribers can still view select stories and recipes. Apple News+ Food will hit the Apple News app on iPhone and iPad in April when the iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 updates are released to the public. Until then, you can test the new Food section as a beta user if you're comfortable running beta software on your devices. Apple News+ Food is currently unavailable on macOS Sequoia 15.4, and whether Apple intends to add it at a future date is unknown. To start, you'll find recipes from notable food publishers such as Allrecipes, Bon Appétit, Food \u0026 Wine, Good Food, Serious Eats, and EatingWell, and more will likely come in future updates.
