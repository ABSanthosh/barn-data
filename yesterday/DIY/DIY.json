    "description": "Safari has a hidden feature for your iPhone that will change how you share, receive, and interact with links — and barely anyone knows about it. The feature works on the latest iOS software, as well as the latest iPadOS and macOS versions.

It lets you share a link to specific words or phrases on almost any webpage — automatically highlighting them when someone opens it. Whether you're quoting a source, pointing out a key section in a long article, or referencing something ultra-specific, Safari now supports a clever URL trick that makes it effortless.
