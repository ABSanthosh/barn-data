    "description": "Pokemón Go. | Image via Niantic, Inc. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) redefine how we interact with digital spaces. AR layers computer-generated content onto the physical world, seamlessly merging digital elements with real environments. VR, on the other hand, creates entirely synthetic worlds, transporting users into fully immersive digital experiences.  Knowing the distinctions between AR and VR isn't just about terminology — it's about understanding how these technologies shape industries, from gaming and enterprise solutions to healthcare and beyond. What is augmented reality?Augmented reality seamlessly blends digital elements with the real world, enhancing what we see, hear, and interact with. Unlike virtual reality, which immerses users in a fully digital space, AR keeps users anchored in their physical environment while adding interactive digital layers. This can range from simple overlays, like navigation prompts in Google Maps Live View, to more...more",

    "link": "https://apple.gadgethacks.com/how-to/change-default-translation-app-ios-ipados/",
    "description": "If you're in the US, your iPhone lets you set default apps for emailing, messaging, calling, web browsing, and even contactless payments and access. With iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4, Apple also lets you pick a new default translation app. Out of the box, your iPhone or iPad is preconfigured to use Apple's Translate app to translate text and speech into different languages. But you will be able to change it to a third-party option like Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, iTranslate, and Translate Now. Since iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 are still in beta, with an expected release sometime in April, not all translation apps will immediately be available as a default option. Developers must update their apps to support this feature by adding specific system permissions and integration features. If your preferred app doesn't show up, it hasn't been updated with the correct entitlement, access key, app extension, and UI. Keep an eye out for app updates that may add this capability.
