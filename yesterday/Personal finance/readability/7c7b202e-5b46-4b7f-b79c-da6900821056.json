  "text": "As part of a plan to reduce the overall Federal budget, Republican lawmakers have created a \"menu\" of options and what the savings could bring. For higher education and financial aid, Republicans have proposed a series of budget cuts and reforms to higher education funding.The measures focus on reducing costs associated with federal student loans, narrowing forgiveness programs, and holding colleges accountable for outcomes. While proponents argue these changes will streamline programs and curb spending, critics warn they could limit college access and affordability for millions of Americans.Overhauling Student Loan RepaymentOne of the cornerstone proposals involves repealing the Biden administration’s Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan, which capped monthly payments for low-income borrowers and forgave balances after 20 or 25 years. In its place, lawmakers suggest offering only two repayment options for loans issued after mid-2024: a standard 10-year plan or a simplified income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. This is similar to Trump's previous student loan proposals.This change is estimated to save $127.3 billion over 10 years. However, advocates for student borrowers argue that eliminating flexible repayment options could make it harder for low-income graduates to manage debt.Holding Colleges Accountable To CostsAnother major proposal involves introducing risk-sharing requirements for federal student loans. Under this plan, colleges would pay annual fees based on the default rates of their graduates. The funds collected would support PROMISE grants designed to improve student outcomes and affordability.This comes from the College Cost Reduction Act.Supporters argue this measure incentivizes institutions to prioritize student success. However, critics worry that smaller or underfunded schools might struggle to meet these requirements, potentially passing costs onto students or limiting enrollment.Narrowing Student Loan Forgiveness ProgramsProposals also aim to tighten eligibility for forgiveness programs, including the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. By limiting who qualifies and imposing new requirements, lawmakers hope to cut costs while maintaining benefits for targeted groups.A related proposal would repeal rules enabling loan forgiveness for borrowers whose schools closed or engaged in misconduct. While projected to save nearly $15 billion, this rollback could leave affected borrowers without recourse to address financial harm.Finally, there is a tax proposal that would have consequences for many pursuing PSLF. The proposal is to no longer allow hospitals or medical groups to claim non-profit status. This would eliminate a path to PSLF for many doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers.Implications For FamiliesIf enacted, these changes would likely increase the financial responsibility placed on students and their families. The elimination of Parent and Grad PLUS loans, for instance, could limit borrowing options for many. Similarly, capping Pell Grant awards at median costs might reduce access for lower-income students.While Republicans emphasize fiscal responsibility, it could risk undermining higher education in this country. Don't Miss These Other Stories:",
