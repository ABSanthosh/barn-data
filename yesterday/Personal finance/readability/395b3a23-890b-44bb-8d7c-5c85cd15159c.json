  "text": "When is Black Friday 2024? Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving — this year, Nov. 29 — and it has typically been the kickstart to the holiday shopping season. Hundreds of retailers launch special in-store and online sales that are meant to encourage shoppers to check items off their list. Black Friday is a time when businesses are able to move from “the red” (operating at a loss) to “the black” (making a profit). While Black Friday has a rich history, this narrative began in the 1980s and has stuck with the holiday ever since. Predicting Black Friday trends You can count on Black Friday sales to deliver intense competition and widespread discounts that stand out from other times of the year. Here's what else to expect this shopping season. Record-high holiday spendingThe National Retail Federation estimates that winter holiday spending during November and December could reach $989 billion, a record high and up from $955.6 billion in 2023. Shoppers will spend an average of $902 on “core holiday spending,” with $641 going toward gifts and $261 for seasonal items, the federation said on an Oct. 30 media call. But that doesn’t mean shoppers are necessarily buying more, says Mark Bergen, professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota. Because of inflation, “you could be spending more even though you’re buying less,” Bergen says. Becoming a “better shopper” this holiday season “doesn’t necessarily mean I spend less,” Bergen says. “It means I spend more wisely or spend differently.” Some shoppers will probably account for rising costs in their budget by spending money on different items — maybe a store brand rather than a name brand or shopping at a discount store instead of a major retailer, says Bergen.Before you build a budgetNerdWallet breaks down your spending and shows you ways to save.Special access for members “A big shift this holiday season will be that many of the really big promotions are going to be member driven,” Bergen says. Store memberships — which range from the free Target Circle program to paid programs such as Walmart+, warehouse memberships and Amazon Prime — can unlock special deals, early access and other benefits this holiday season. Why this special privilege for members when Black Friday deals used to be for everyone? “Because of inflation, companies have become more sophisticated in their ability to raise prices,” Bergen says. “Part of that has been their realization that they can raise the average prices but give more targeted discounts to their members.” The bottom line: Taking account of your memberships might make a difference for your budget this holiday season. A rise in social media-inspired shopping While retail heavy-hitters will be a go-to for many shoppers, social media platforms will also be popular places to shop, especially for younger generations. “Facebook Marketplace and TikTok Shop are leading in intentional purchases, while Facebook and Instagram remain popular for more casual browsing,” Janelle Sallenave, Chime’s chief spending officer, said in an email interview. Her observations come from data from Chime’s 2024 “Spendfluence report.\" “Each platform appeals differently to its users: Facebook Marketplace attracts those searching for specific items, like furniture, while TikTok Shop engages trend-seekers,” Sallenave said. But not all purchases are planned. “One of the biggest takeaways from our Spendluence report is that ‘just browsing’ leads to a purchase for 99% of Americans with consumers spending an average of $168 on social media shopping in the past six months alone,” Sallenave said. “This is a good reminder for holiday shoppers to be cautious and intentional with their spending, as platforms and brands will likely ramp up their ads and promotions.”Store policies that benefit shoppers Retailers really cater to shoppers during the holiday season. Here’s what you can expect this year: Expanded store hours: Opening early and closing late gives people the flexibility to stop into stores and make purchases around their busy schedules. For example, Best Buy will be closed on Thanksgiving, but the retailer is extending its store hours during the rest of the season. Check your local retailer to find out specific details for their policies that typically run through Dec. 24. Smooth and extended return policies: Retailers know that shoppers will probably be making returns after the holidays and want to make it easier. For example, at Best Buy, most items purchased from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31 can be returned through Jan. 14, 2025. However most policies have some caveats — such as requiring receipts for returns or excluding items bought from third party sellers — that shoppers should be aware of. Robust price matching: For example, Target will price match its competitors on items bought within a 14-day window and match its own prices if they drop during the designated window (Nov. 7 through Dec. 24). There are a few notable outliers: Neither Amazon nor Walmart have special holiday price matching policies. Walmart’s current policy doesn’t even match special event prices from its own website, Walmart.com, or match prices from third party sellers. Watch for early Black Friday sales As you think about your budget and how you want to spend your money this holiday season, be mindful of when sales begin. Retailers have started launching sales in the weeks leading up to Nov. 29:Costco Costco is offering a month of Black Friday deals, from Nov. 1 through Dec. 2, with new warehouse and online sales each week. Online shoppers should look for sale items tagged with a “Black Friday Deal” icon, but beware: warehouse prices and online prices vary slightly, as online prices account for delivery costs. Best Buy Best Buy is starting its official Black Friday sale a week early on Nov. 21. But shoppers don’t have to wait until then: starting Nov. 8, the retailer will release doorbusters every Friday, along with other Black Friday deals, through Dec. 20. Members of the My Best Buy Plus and My Best Buy Total plans get early access to doorbusters. Sam’s Club While Sam’s Club’s official Black Friday sale runs Nov. 28-Dec. 1, the wholesale club is currently hosting an “instant savings” sale on a variety of products that lasts through Dec. 1. Weekend online-only doorbuster sales on various product categories are also part of the month of deals: Nov. 8-10 features home and apparel deals; Nov. 15-17 is for top tech; and Nov. 22-24 is all about toys and gifts. TargetTarget is hosting its first ever early Black Friday sale Nov. 7-9. The retailer is also promoting a deal of the day every day from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. Target Circle members will also be eligible for special discounts and access. Walmart Walmart is hosting a two-tiered sale, with different start dates for online and in-store shoppers: Event one: Nov. 11 for online shoppers and Nov. 15 for in-store shoppers. Event two: Nov. 25 for online shoppers and Nov. 29 for in-store shoppers. In addition, Walmart+ members get early access to deals. Tips for shopping during anxious times Some shoppers might feel uneasy heading into Black Friday this year. The holiday shopping season comes on the heels of a highly contested presidential election, a series of natural disasters and rising costs that have stretched budgets. These outside forces are stressful and exhausting, which are emotions that affect your spending habits. You may be more likely to make mistakes and be more vulnerable to impulsive decisions when you’re feeling this way. “Try to shop earlier in the day, when you’re less tired,” Bergen says.He also recommends waiting a night, if possible, before making a big purchase. Even as retailers rely on one-day deals and lightning sales to draw you in, being rested can clarify your shopping and spending goals and help you stay on track.Get more financial clarity with NerdWalletMonitor your credit, track your spending and see all of your finances together in a single place.",
