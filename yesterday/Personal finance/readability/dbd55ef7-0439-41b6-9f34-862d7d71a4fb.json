It’s everything you’d expect from Disney: nostalgia galore, festive parades and colorful novelty foods. The theme is “Celebrate Happy,” but let’s be real — happiness gets expensive fast at the Happiest Place on Earth.I was invited to attend a multiday media preview, which meant Disney picked up the tab for my hotel and park tickets. But I also bought my dad a ticket so he could join me (after all, Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters is way less fun when you’re solo). Plus, we shelled out plenty of cash on food and extras. That gave me a firsthand look at what’s worth the money — and what’s not.What’s new at Disneyland’s 70th celebration?The 70th Celebration Churro is rolled in ube sugar and topped with blue raspberry icing. (Photo by Sally French)Disney is leaning into its history with its 70th anniversary celebration, incorporating throwbacks that guests from decades ago may remember. Most of the new additions give nods to classic shows and the park's history, including:“World of Color Happiness!”, a revised version of the nighttime water and light show at Disneyland’s sibling park, Disney California Adventure, combines audio from Walt Disney’s 1955 opening-day speech with imagery from newer Disney films, including “Inside Out,” “Tangled” and “Encanto.”The “Celebrate Happy” cavalcade is basically a mini-parade through the park. This one features some characters you might not be familiar with, like Duffy (Mickey Mouse’s bear, according to Disney lore) and ShellieMay (Duffy’s friend, who is also a bear).“Tapestry of Happiness,” a projection show on the historic facade of “It’s a Small World,” honors Disney artist Mary Blair, who famously worked on films such as “Cinderella” and “Alice in Wonderland,” and helped design the “It’s a Small World” ride.A historical walking tour costs an additional $120 per person, but might appeal to diehard Disney nerds like me. It covers Disney’s seven decades of history, including rides on some of the park’s original attractions (without having to wait in the standard line), plus some included snacks and reserved parade seating.More than 70 new food items are basically made for Instagram. Some treats, like a churro doused in ube sprinkles, are purple to match the event’s color palette. Others nod to the past, like the W.E.D. Chili Cheese Baked Potato named after Walt Disney’s initials. It’s a dish Walt Disney might’ve ordered, as he famously loved chili.How to join Disneyland’s 70th on a budgetThe real magic is a trick you’ll have to pull off yourself — finding ways to save. Here are my go-to tactics.Buy discounted tickets this summerFor visits between May 16 and August 14, 2025, Disney is offering a four-day ticket deal that breaks down to just $100 per day, which is cheap by Disney standards. Even better, authorized resellers like Undercover Tourist offer that deal (and others) for less. In fact, I bought my dad’s ticket there and saved about $20 compared to Disney’s price.Military personnel, Southern California residents and those with access to corporate discounts might also be able to score discounted Disney tickets.Don’t sleep on pointsA room at the Disneyland Hotel. (Photo by Sally French)If staying close to the parks is your priority, you might want to book a room at one of the three Disney-owned hotels. Disney's Grand Californian Hotel \u0026 Spa and the Disneyland Hotel — the fanciest ones — are offering discounts of up to 20% on weeknights during summer 2025.One of the best reasons to stay at a Disney-owned hotel is the early entry benefit. If you have a theme park ticket, you can enter the parks 30 minutes before everyone else, which can be key to getting on popular rides before the lines get too long. I used my Disneyland Hotel key to make a beeline to Guardians of the Galaxy — Mission: Breakout before a line had formed.The Guardians of the Galaxy — Mission: Breakout! ride at Disney California Adventure. (Photo by Sally French) If you don’t plan to use early entry, staying elsewhere might offer better value. Many hotels within walking distance are bookable on points, and some even offer free breakfast.Some of the closest hotels with free breakfast are:Hyatt House at Anaheim Resort/Convention Center: Category 4 (12,000 – 18,000 World of Hyatt points per night).Hyatt Place at Anaheim Resort/Convention Center: Category 4 (12,000 – 18,000 World of Hyatt points per night).Home2 Suites by Hilton Anaheim Resort: Standard rooms start at 65,000 Hilton Honors points per night.SpringHill Suites Anaheim Resort/Convention Center: Standard rooms start at 35,000 Marriott Bonvoy points per night.Bring your own snacks, then splurge strategicallyThe Disneyland 70th Celebration Abominable Snowman Sipper. (Photo by Sally French)Disneyland is surprisingly cool with you bringing your own food (with a few exceptions; for example, glass containers aren't allowed). You can save on food by packing a meal, snacks and reusable water bottles.But leave some room in your budget (and your belly) to splurge on the limited-time food items specific to Disney's 70th. Among the best values are:Pulled pork mac and cheese in a bread bowl (Refreshment Corner, Disneyland’s Main Street, U.S.A.): This delicious entree is served with the bread bowl’s lid on the side. It could easily feed two people.Popcorn buckets and drink sippers: These come in multiple designs, including some that feature the Abominable Snowman from the Matterhorn Bobsleds ride. And they double as souvenirs!World of Color Dessert Party: This one’s admittedly a huge splurge at $94 per person, but I have strong feelings about it. I’m 4’10”, and every “standing room” fireworks or show viewing I’ve ever attended is just someone’s armpit in my face. This comes with actual seats, a fancy dessert box, unlimited nonalcoholic drinks (plus one adult beverage if you’re 21+) and a killer view. On a packed summer night? Worth it.Don’t skip Downtown DisneyBowling at Splitsville Luxury Lanes starts at $21 per person. (Photo by Sally French)You can still join the Disneyland 70th Anniversary fun without a park ticket by strolling through the adjacent, free-to-enter Downtown Disney District. But keep in mind that individual attractions may cost extra. For example, you might go bowling at Splitsville, with prices starting at just $21 per person.Several Downtown Disney restaurants are adding their own special menu items for the park's 70th anniversary. Beignets Expressed has a blueberry cobbler beignet, and Black Tap Craft Burgers \u0026 Shakes has a “Cotton Candy Crazyshake” with purple and pink rock candy. On the adult beverage front, Jazz Kitchen Coastal Grill \u0026 Patio puts a spin on a classic with the French “70” — a bubbly lavender gin cocktail.How to maximize your rewards",
