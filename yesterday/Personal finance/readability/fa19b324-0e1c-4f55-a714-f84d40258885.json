  "text": "Most of the best bank account promotions on the market right now cater exclusively to consumers. Indeed, many of the United States’ best online banks seem to favor personal account holders rather than business owners. But not all banks shortchange small-business owners. If you’re a small-business owner, solopreneur, or freelancer, you just need to know where to look to find potentially lucrative credit union and bank account bonuses and referral opportunities. Best Small-Business Bank Account Promotions \u0026 Bonuses These are the best small-business bank promotions this month. Unless otherwise noted, all are available to businesses of all sizes, including sole proprietors and freelancers without formal incorporation. All are FDIC-insured as well. However, small-business checking and savings accounts impose minimum balance requirements, monthly maintenance fees, and other requirements or restrictions that can impact their appeal.

Apply Now Axos Bank Basic Business Checking — Up to $400 Cash Bonus Bonus: Up to $400 Good Through: September 30, 2025 Requirements: Promo code only Opt for smarter business banking and not only will you take control of your company’s finances, but you’ll also get to enjoy a generous $400 welcome bonus! Just apply by September 30, 2025 and use the promo code NEW400 to claim your bonus. Make the smart move for your business today! Apply Now PNC Bank Business Checking — Up to $1,000 Cash Bonus Bonus: Up to $1,000 Good Through: December 31, 2024 Requirements: Qualifying deposits and/or transaction minimums Open an eligible new PNC Bank business checking account (Business Checking or Business Checking Plus) by December 31, 2024, for the opportunity to earn a cash bonus worth up to $1,000. Here’s how the bonus offer works: Open an eligible account by December 31, 2024. Maintain an average cycle balance (account balance) of $5,000 or more for each of the first three statement cycles. Complete at least 20 total qualifying debit card transactions within the first three statement cycles. Once you’ve completed the qualifying activities, you’ll receive a $200 cash bonus in your account within 90 days. Alternatively, open a new Treasury Enterprise Plan or Analysis Business Checking account by December 31, 2024, for the opportunity to earn a $500 bonus.

Or you can increase the bonus to $1,000 by maintaining a minimum average ledger balance of $100,000 foreach of the first three statement cycles. Apply Now Final Word Most of the banks mentioned here do not cater to small-business owners exclusively. They also offer consumer accounts — in some cases, generous and expansive lineups that include free checking accounts, rewards checking accounts, CDs with above-average rates, money market accounts, and high-yield savings accounts that might just keep your emergency fund on pace with inflation. Others offer cash-back credit cards, among other types of rewards-laden spending aids for individuals. That matters. After all, every business owner is a person too — one with personal money management needs. That means every business owner needs a personal checking account, among other key personal banking relationships. If you’d like that relationship to involve the same bank you choose for your business banking needs, perhaps one of these promotions will seal the deal.",
