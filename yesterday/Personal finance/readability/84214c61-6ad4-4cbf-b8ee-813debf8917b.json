  "text": "The Japanese Airlines USA Credit Card is issued by First National Bank of Omaha (FNBO) and is the first and only co-branded card offered by Japanese Airlines (JAL) that's available in the U.S. The card offers decent rewards for travel, depending on what annual fee you end up having to pay, but it comes with lackluster travel perks and limited transfer partners. If youâ€™re a Japanese Airlines loyalist, the card can be valuable. But if your trips with the airline are few and far between, youâ€™re better off with another airline or general travel credit card. Here are five things to know about the Japanese Airlines USA Credit Card. 1. You can select one of two reward tiersDuring the application process, youâ€™ll be asked to select which of these two reward options you want:Basic rewards: This rewards tier costs $35 annually and earns 1 mile per $2 spent.Â Premium rewards: This tier costs $85 annually and earns 2 miles per $1 spent on eligible JAL purchases and 1 mile per $1 spent on everything else.Â Existing cardholders can also change their rewards tier by completing an online rewards change application, without having to be issued a new card. So for example, if you already have the $35-annual-fee basic rewards program, you can fill out a form to request the premium rewards tier and, if approved, will begin to pay an additional $50 annual credit card rewards program fee. ðŸ¤“Nerdy TipTo apply for the Japanese Airlines USA Credit Card, you must be at least 18 years old, be a U.S. resident or move to the U.S. within 90 days of applying for the card, have income in the U.S. and be a primary member of the JAL Mileage Bank (JMB). You can join the JAL Mileage Bank program by enrolling online and filling out a form that requires an email and home address, phone number and other personal information.2. Redemption options are decent, but limitedYouâ€™ll earn JAL miles with the Japanese Airlines USA Credit Card, but you donâ€™t need the credit card to do that. You can also earn miles through JAL domestic and international flights, flights on Japanese Mileage Bank partner airlines as well as on Oneworld alliance airlines, hotel stays, experiences and more. You can redeem miles mainly toward JAL and Japanese Mileage Bank partner options. Redeem miles for award tickets on JAL flights, in-flight coupons, gift certificates, hotel bookings and car rentals. Award tickets are available starting at 1,000 miles, but the minimum amount of miles youâ€™ll need for them will vary depending on where youâ€™re flying and seat availability on the flight when you book. Generally, the lowest number of miles, or base miles, required for an economy seat on an international flight between a major North American city and Japan is 25,000 plus taxes and fees, and 85,000 miles plus taxes and fees for a first-class ticket during the regular season. Note that miles expire after three years. You can also redeem JAL miles toward services and products offered by Japanese Mileage Bank partners, one of which is Marriott Bonvoy. You can transfer any Marriott points you earn to JAL at a 3-points-to-1-mile ratio. You also get 5,000 miles for every 60,000 Marriott points you transfer to miles.JAL is also a member of the Oneworld alliance, which means you can book JAL award tickets using miles earned from frequent flyer programs of any of the Oneworld member airlines. 3. It comes with some travel perksIn addition to ongoing rewards, the card comes with travel perks and benefits, including the following: Cardholders get a one-time 5,000-mile bonus on their first JAL International Flight when they use their card to pay.Â Get 10% bonus miles every time the primary cardholder flies with JAL or its partners.Â When you pay with your Japanese Airlines USA Credit Card, youâ€™ll get a 10% discount for all in-flight purchases on JAL international and domestic flights as well as a 5% discount on duty-free shopping at select stores in the Haneda and Narita Airports in Japan.Â You can earn five JAL Life Status points for every 1,500 miles you earn from making purchases with your card. Life Status points are lifetime activity points that help you earn Japanese Mileage Bank elite benefits like lounge coupons.Â 4. There are limited-time offers for new cardholdersNew applicants who get the card by March 1, 2025, can get the following, as of this writing:No annual feel for the first year of cardholding. This applies to both versions of the card, after which holders are charged the ongoing annual fees.Â Points bonus. Earn 5,000 miles when you spend $5,000 within the first three months of account opening. Premium rewards holders can get an additional 5,000 points when they spend $7,000 in the first three months of account opening, for a total of 10,000 points.Â 5. Youâ€™re likely better off with a general travel cardIf your travels donâ€™t take you to Japan often, another airline or travel card will be more valuable in terms of rewards, flexibility and travel perks. If youâ€™re not loyal to any airline and are willing to pay an annual fee, consider the $95-annual-fee Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card. It's a popular card because of its lucrative rewards rate and flexible redemption options. It earns 2 miles per dollar spent on purchases and 5 miles per dollar on hotels, vacation rentals and car rentals booked through Capital One Travel. You can redeem miles by booking travel through Capital One, for statement credit against travel purchases, andÂ toward gift cards. You can also transfer miles to more than 15 airline and hotel partners. The card also comes with a large sign-up bonus: Enjoy a one-time bonus of 75,000 miles once you spend $4,000 on purchases within 3 months from account opening, equal to $750 in travel. (see rates and fees).",
