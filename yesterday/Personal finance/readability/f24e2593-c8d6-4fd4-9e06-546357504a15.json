BigCash claims to make it easy to earn extra money during your spare time by completing simple tasks like taking surveys, playing games, and more. But is BigCash legit?

In today’s review, I’m sharing everything you need to know about BigCash (also known as BigCashWeb and Bigcashweb.com), including how it works, how much you can expect to earn, and whether or not it’s worth your time. Click here to sign up for BigCash. BigCash Review Below is my BigCash review. Here’s what the homepage of BigCash looks like. Everything is done through their website. What is BigCash? BigCash is a Get-Paid-To (GPT) site that started in 2015 and rewards you for completing tasks like surveys, games, signing up for apps, and special offers. It’s completely free to join, and they partner with trusted brands and market research companies to bring you different ways to earn. There are over 1,000,000 BigCash members, so it is a very popular site! You complete tasks, earn coins, and redeem those coins for PayPal cash or gift cards like Amazon, Visa, Netflix, Google Play, Apple, Walmart, Playstation, and Xbox. On BigCash, every 250 coins you earn equals $1 USD. The platform is easy to use and doesn’t require any technical skills. How does BigCash work? BigCash is easy to use, even if you’re brand new to platforms like this. Here’s how it works: Sign up for a free account by clicking here. You can sign up using your Google account or email address. The process is quick and easy. Complete tasks to earn coins. Once you’re logged in, you’ll find different tasks in the “Earn” section. These include surveys, playing games, signing up for offers, downloading free apps, and more. Redeem your coins for rewards. After you’ve earned enough coins (minimum 250 coins), you can redeem them for PayPal cash or gift cards. Plus, BigCash gives bonuses for users who save their coins and opt for higher cash outs, rewarding them with extra money on top of their earnings. For example, cashing out $60 can earn you an additional $40 bonus. They also give surprise bonuses with every cash out, ranging from $0.10 to $1,000. They also have a referral program where you can invite friends to join BigCash and earn $15 per invite as well as 50% of their lifetime earnings. So, this could be a form of passive income! How to make money with the BigCashWeb referral program The BigCashWeb referral program is an easy way to earn extra money. When you invite someone to join BigCash, you can earn $15 for each person who signs up and completes certain tasks. On top of that, you will also earn 50% of whatever they make on the platform for the rest of their time using it. How much money can you make on BigCash? Your earnings on BigCash depend on how much time you spend on the platform and the types of tasks you complete. For example: Surveys and offers tend to pay anywhere from a few cents to several dollars. Games usually have high payouts, especially for reaching specific milestones (like a new level). Referrals can help you earn extra without much effort (you can make $15 per invite as well as 50% of their lifetime earnings) While you won’t get rich using BigCash, it’s possible to earn $50-$100 or more per month if you’re consistent. Pros and cons of BigCash It’s important to remember that BigCash is a platform designed to help you earn extra money by completing tasks. However, how much you earn will depend on the time you invest and the types of tasks you complete. Some of the pros of using BigCash include: It’s easy to use – Signing up is quick, and the platform is straightforward. You can earn money by completing simple tasks like surveys, playing games, and signing up for offers. There are many reward options – BigCash lets you redeem your coins for PayPal cash, Amazon gift cards, Google Play cards, and more. Fast payouts – Rewards are processed quickly, so you don’t have to wait long to access your earnings. Referral program – You can make $15 per invite as well as 50% of their lifetime earnings. Some of the cons of using BigCash include (I should note that I don’t really think these are cons, but they are things to know): Time commitment – While tasks are easy, your earnings will depend on how much time you’re willing to invest. If you’re looking for higher payouts, some tasks (like game milestones) may require significant effort. Not all tasks credit immediately – Some offers can take up to 24 hours to credit, and there may be instances where you need to contact support for missing rewards. I did have to contact support for one of my tasks, but they were helpful and credited me after I submitted proof (a quick screenshot) that I completed the offer. If you’re willing to put in the time and effort, BigCash can be a fun and rewarding way to earn extra money. Is BigCash legit or a scam? Yes, BigCash is legit. The platform is free to use, and many users (myself included) have been paid without any issues. They have positive reviews on Trustpilot, with most users praising the platform for being easy to use and reliable when it comes to payouts. It currently has over 1,000 reviews on Trustpilot, with an average rating of 4.1 out of 5 stars. That said, like any GPT site, it’s important to manage your expectations. While you can make extra money on BigCash, it’s not a replacement for a full-time income. But if you’re looking for an easy way to make some extra cash, BigCash is worth a try. Here’s a screenshot of the offers I tried out on BigCash. In case you’re wondering why they have a slash in the numbers (like where it says $2.1 $6.3 and the $2.1 is slashed out), it means there is a 3x multiplier applied. However, value per coin increases when the cash out is more than 2500 coins. The payouts listed on every offer are in context to when the cash out is more than 2500 coins. If lower, then payout is matched based on $1 = 250 coins. My experience with BigCash I decided to try BigCash for myself so that I could honestly write this BigCash review, and I was surprised by how easy it was to use. Signing up took less than one minute, and there were plenty of tasks to choose from. I focused on surveys and games and reached the minimum payout of $1 within just a few minutes. The payment was processed quickly, and I received the free Amazon gift card in less than 5 minutes. I also tried a few other offers so that I could test out a variety, and I earned a total of $5 in my spare time. The games I played included Solitaire, Word Connect, and Scavenger Hunt. They were all free to play and I didn’t have to deposit any money (there were ads in the games and I could deposit money, but I chose not to). I also got paid to sign up for USA Today and to install the Capital One Shopping app on my phone. Overall, it was a positive experience. It was easy to earn coins and I liked how there was a variety of games to play – games that many people probably already play so they can easily earn some extra money to continue playing. I plan to keep using the platform when I have extra time so that I can continue to test it for this BigCash Review. Below is a screenshot of the payments I received.

In case you’re wondering why they have a slash in the numbers (like where it says $2.1 $6.3 and the $2.1 is slashed out), it means there is a 3x multiplier applied. However, value per coin increases when the cash out is more than 2500 coins. The payouts listed on every offer are in context to when the cash out is more than 2500 coins. If lower, then payout is matched based on $1 = 250 coins\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy experience with BigCash\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to try BigCash for myself so that I could honestly write this BigCash review, and I was surprised by how easy it was to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSigning up took less than one minute, and there were plenty of tasks to choose from. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI focused on surveys and games and reached the minimum payout of $1 within just a few minutes.
