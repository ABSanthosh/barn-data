Too many people don't shop around for the best rates on money market accounts - costing them money.For example, the Federal Reserve reports that the average money market account rate is currently just 0.64% APY. If you were depositing $10,000, that would only earn you $64 per year.However, the best money market rates we have on our list above are earning 4.00% APY. That means, on that same $10,000 deposit, you'd earn $400 per year! That's a $336 per year difference!Money Market Accounts (MMA) vs. Certificates of Deposit (CDs)Money markets also have the advantage over certificates of deposit because they are liquid - you can get a higher interest rate on your money but you don't have to worry about tying your money up for a long period of time.While there are some CDs that earn higher rates than you'll find in a money market account, those CDs typically have 5-10 year time frames.Depending on where you open a money market account, it may not be FDIC insured. CDs are typically always FDIC insured. Learn more what it means to be FDIC insured here.And if you sell before your expiration date, you typically face large penalties. You can get a glimpse of the best CD rates here, but if you need liquid savings, you're better off going with a savings account or money market account.Why Should You Trust Us?The College Investor has been actively tracking the best money market rates since 2018, with a daily updated list that monitors roughly 50 banks and credit unions that have a history of great rates. But we also are always scouting out other banks that may compete on this list.Unlike other well-known companies who create \"best money market rate lists\", we strive to put out rates in order highest to lowest so that you can know you're actually getting the best rate. And if you don't make the cut, too bad. You can find the full list of our bank review here. Common Money Market QuestionsHere's our FAQ on money markets based on some of the common questions we get.What's the difference between a money market and savings account?There is very little difference between a savings account and a money market account. Both accounts are FDIC insured, both have limits on how many checks and transfers you can do, and both are offered by banks, credit unions, and investment firms.The big difference is that a money market account typically pays a little bit higher interest, but it also typically requires a slightly higher minimum balance.What's the difference between a money market and a CD?A CD is a banking product that has a structured term, and you must keep your money in that CD for the term in order to get your interest payment. With a money market account, you can deposit and withdrawal your money at any time.Are money market accounts FDIC insured?Yes! Money market accounts are FDIC insured.Are money market accounts offered only at banks?Money market accounts are offered at banks, credit unions, and even some brokerage firms.Do money market accounts charge fees?Some may charge monthly maintenance fees, especially if you don't keep the minimum balance required. Always make sure that you're looking out for fees!Can you lose your money in a money market account?No, you cannot lose money in a money market account as long as you're under the FDIC insurance deposit limits.Final ThoughtsA money market account can be a great way to save your money.You typically earn higher interest rates, but there are some restrictions above and beyond what you usually find for savings accounts. Just like any account, make sure you're opening the best money market account for your needs so you can reap the rewards.MethodologyThe College Investor is dedicated to helping you make informed decisions around complex financial topics like finding the best money market account.
