  "text": "Home / News / 5M Borrowers Approved For Student Loan ForgivenessThe Biden Administration has approved $183.6 billion in student loan forgiveness across 28 initiatives, assisting over 5 million borrowers since 2021.New approvals include $465 million in Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), $1.26 billion through borrower defense, and $2.5 billion for borrowers with disabilities.States like California and Texas benefit the most, while smaller states such as Alaska and Wyoming see fewer approvals due to lower borrower populations. The Biden Administration announced a significant milestone in student loan forgiveness, with over five million borrowers now approved for relief across various programs. This marks a total of $183.6 billion in loan forgiveness since President Biden took office, a figure spread across 28 targeted initiatives aimed at reducing debt burdens for Americans in public service, those with disabilities, and borrowers who attended predatory institutions.“Four years ago, President Biden made a promise to fix a broken student loan system,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. “Today, life-changing student debt relief is possible for more than five million borrowers—more than any other administration in history.”Here's what to know about the latest student loan forgiveness:Student Loan ReliefThe latest efforts include:Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF): Relief for 6,100 borrowers, amounting to $465 million. Since the administration began, over 1,069,000 borrowers have received PSLF, compared to just 7,000 prior to 2021.Borrower Defense: Nearly 85,000 borrowers will receive $1.26 billion in relief. This includes 73,600 individuals from institutions like the Center for Excellence in Higher Education (CEHE), which engaged in misleading practices regarding salaries and employment prospects.Disability Discharges: An additional 61,000 borrowers with total and permanent disabilities will have $2.5 billion in loans discharged, bringing the total under this program to $18.7 billion since 2021.It's important to note that none of these initiatives are new loan forgiveness programs. However, the Biden Administration has been working to improve the implementation and execution of these programs, especially Public Service Loan Forgiveness.Related: For Profit Student Loan Forgiveness School ListState-By-State ImpactState-level data illustrates how this relief is distributed. Larger states such as California, Texas, and Florida report the highest numbers of approved borrowers and total forgiven balances. For instance:California: Leads in PSLF with over 159,000 borrowers approved for $13 billion in relief.Florida: Tops borrower defense approvals, reflecting a high number of individuals affected by misleading educational institutions.Smaller states see fewer approvals due to their population sizes:Alaska: Records the lowest number of borrowers for Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) and SAVE plans, with 1,260 and 550 borrowers, respectively.Wyoming: Has the smallest PSLF borrower count at 1,520, but this represents a meaningful share of its public service workers.Looking AheadBeyond forgiveness programs, the Biden administration has worked to make higher education more affordable. However, initiatives like the SAVE plan, which offers income-driven repayment options, have been held up by the courts. With the next administration set to take over in the coming weeks, student loan borrowers are on edge with what might happen with loan repayment plans, forgiveness, and more.Don't Miss These Other Stories: Robert Farrington is America’s Millennial Money Expert® and America’s Student Loan Debt Expert™, and the founder of The College Investor, a personal finance site dedicated to helping millennials escape student loan debt to start investing and building wealth for the future.
