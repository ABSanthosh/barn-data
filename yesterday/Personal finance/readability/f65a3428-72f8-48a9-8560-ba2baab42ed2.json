  "text": "Executive Summary Financial advisor conferences are not what they used to be. Once the domain of membership associations that, especially amongst independent financial advisors, created a central space for networking and community, conferences were primarily built around professional development (i.e., continuing education) and often held a space for the vendors who served those advisors, with organizations like the Financial Planning Association convening the largest conferences for financial advisors. But over the past 20 years, the shift from commission-based to recurring revenue (AUM and subscription fee) models has, for the first time, allowed advisory firms to begin to size and scale up. What was primarily an industry of eat-what-you-kill solo financial advisors and their administrative staff has increasingly evolved into multi-advisor firms with a wider base of support staff, and increasingly specialized roles within the advisory firms as staged career tracks emerge, departments form, and greater levels of complexity develop. As a result of this increasing role specialization within advisory firms, conferences for financial advisors have also become increasingly specialized over the past decade. Broad-based conferences that simply convened advisors because they were engaged in financial planning or operating as independents have given way to a plethora of more targeted events, from conferences 'just' on tax planning to events focused on advisor technology, to those hyper-targeting financial advisors at certain stages of business who are seeking peers of the exact same size to discuss best practices about how to deal with their business complexities. These discussions can range from talent development and succession planning to how to systematize and scale their marketing alongside their planning and investment services. Consequently, the irony is that there seem to be even more conferences for financial advisors today than there were a decade ago (when many lamented that there were 'too many' conferences to choose from!). However, the good and bad news of this evolution is that because conferences are more specialized than ever, there's even more opportunity to get value out of a 'good-fit' conference… and it's even more of a waste of time to go to an event that is not a good fit for the advisor's needs and circumstances! As someone who has been speaking at 50–70 conferences a year for 20 years myself, I've seen the good and bad of our wide range of industry events, from the industry associations to the broker-dealers and insurance companies and RIA custodians, the rise of vendor conferences and media-driven events, private company events, and more. As a result, I am often asked for my own suggestions of what, really, are the industry's 'best' conferences to attend, and back in 2012, I started to craft my own annual list of 'best-in-class' top conferences for financial advisors. Having updated our annual conference list every year since, I'm excited now to present my newest list of \"Top Financial Advisor Conferences\" for the upcoming 2025 year, with a particular focus on highlighting how advisors can find the 'right' conference that fits their interests and business needs, from events on advisor technology (and one dedicated specifically to AI!), to conferences on marketing, learning business development skills, or developing next generation talent, to the top events for those who still use conferences to up their technical game in areas like tax planning. Plus a few events that are simply great well-rounded experiences for those who want to enjoy the conference, the destination, the sessions they attend, and their fellow attendees. In addition, we've also updated our popular \"Master Conference List\" for all financial advisor conferences we could find for 2025, both for advisors looking for a wider range of events to attend (if you want to delve deeper into a particular topical area) and for vendors looking for more conferences to exhibit at! (And as more conferences are announced in the coming months, we'll continue to update the Master Conference List well into the coming year!). So I hope you'll find this year's 2025 top conferences list (and our updated Master Conference List) to be helpful as a guide in planning your own conference budget and schedule for next year, and be certain to take advantage of the special discount codes that several conferences have offered to all of you as Nerd's Eye View readers!

The Specialization Of Advisor Conferences As Advisory Firm Teams Grow And Specialize For professionals in any industry – including financial advisors – the traditional conference usually fulfills 4 key functions: to share and learn best practices from others in the community, to network with others to form new business relationships, to see the latest and greatest from industry vendors who exhibit, and last, but certainly not least, to engage in professional development and learning opportunities (or at the least, to fulfill Continuing Education requirements). Notably, though, advisors of the past (and still today, to some extent) were largely defined by the products and services they sold, and the ways that they were compensated, simply because that meant they ran different business models, often with different regulatory licenses and registrations, serving different types of clientele, which resulted in different needs from a networking and professional development perspective. In other words, planning-centric advisors wanted to talk to others who were focused first and foremost on financial planning, while AUM-based advisors at an RIA wanted to compare themselves to other AUM-based RIAs, insurance agents working on a commission wanted to talk to other insurance agents about what was working for them, and the investment management consultants working with pension plan investment committees wanted to commiserate with others doing the same. To meet these needs, industry membership associations arose. By virtue of their varying membership requirements and who chose to join which ones, the advisors who affiliated with these organizations chose the ones that were aligned with what they did and whom they served, and consequently, ended up naturally sharing many commonalities – FPA members were financial-planning oriented and NAPFA members were fee-only (and thus also had to be with an RIA), while NAIFA members were affiliated with insurance companies and IMCA members were typically investment management consultants serving institutional investors via large brokerage firms. And those commonalities made it easier to craft an agenda of professional development content that would be relevant to all the members, create a community of similar individuals who could share best practices, establish an environment in which the desired networking could happen, and attract the relevant vendors who wanted to be in front of that particular segment of advisors. This framework was further expedited by the fact that most financial advisors were individual practitioners running their own practices. Those who were affiliated with a larger platform – for instance, a national broker-dealer or insurance company – might have company-provided resources for professional development, and a natural community of fellow advisors to share best practices with because of their shared affiliation to the platform. However, for independent advisors in particular, there was no shared large firm with home-office resources, by virtue of being independent… and the drive for individual practitioners to share anything and everything about their practices with their peers meant conferences for independent advisors driven by membership associations they joined were the biggest events in the industry. The Sizing Up Of Advisory Teams One of the most dominant trends of the advisory industry over the past 20 years has been the shift from commissions to fees. Which is notable not just relative to the industry's ongoing debates about the 'best' compensation model for consumers and their associated conflicts of interest, but also simply because the transition from insurance and investment product sales for a commission to earning ongoing fees instead (either as an AUM fee or a subscription fee) from an advisory relationship gave advisory firms a recurring revenue base from which they could, for the first time, actually begin to size and scale up. After all, when advisors are mostly or entirely commission-based, they effectively wake up January 1st with zero (or at least, near-zero) revenue, as the clock on commissions starts over every year. In practice, there might be a small amount of trails, but there generally isn't much more to cover the most basic administrative servicing requirements for existing policies or shareholders. As a result, most advisory firms historically only had 2 types of staff: financial advisors who brought in clients, and administrative staff support for their back-office needs so they could get out and find more clients. When new advisors came on board, it was always to simply be another 'producer' who went out to get their own clients, too. With recurring-revenue AUM or subscription fee models, though, the entire advisory business begins to change. At some point, an advisory firm owner wakes up on January 1st and might have $50M of assets under management generating $500,000 of annual revenue, for which the advisory firm 'just' needs to provide great ongoing service and financial advice to retain that client. And so advisory firms, for the first time, began to hire 'service advisors' whose role was not to go get new clients, but instead to serve the firm's existing clients. Which the advisory firm could do at less than the total amount of revenue generated, allowing for the firm owners to generate a standalone profit as an advisor enterprise, to either distribute as a dividend or to reinvest to continue to expand the staff infrastructure of the firm. The end result is that while 20 years ago, the 'average' advisory firm might have generated $200,000 of revenue on $20M of AUM with an advisor and their assistant, today there are advisor enterprises with millions, tens of millions, or even $100M+ in revenue, managing hundreds of millions, billions, or $10B+ in assets under management, that might employ dozens or hundreds of team members. And as advisory firm teams have expanded so dramatically, so has the specialization of their roles (as is common for businesses in any industry that size up). In the past, an advisor might have gone out to get the clients, built and delivered their financial plan, and serviced them on an ongoing basis, while also managing their portfolios. Today, however, that advisory firm might have a marketing and sales team doing business development, which hands new clients off to service advisors to give advice and manage relationships, while leveraging a centralized planning team to build and maintain the client's financial plans, as a dedicated investment team does all of the research, portfolio trading, and ongoing monitoring and due diligence. Specialization Of Advisory Firms And Roles Has Led To Conference Specialization The specialization of roles that naturally emerges as advisory firms size up means that it's difficult to make any single conference good for all those who call themselves \"financial advisors\", primarily for 2 reasons. The first is that the role of financial advisors itself is bifurcating in many ways: between those who focus more on investments versus financial planning, getting new clients versus serving existing ones, being on teams versus leading those teams, etc. And the second is that knowledge domains are also specializing within advisory firms (as the investment team houses investment knowledge, and different advisors specialize themselves as one goes deeper on tax planning, another focuses more with business owners, a third is trying to improve the client experience across the whole advisory firm, etc.). In addition, there are more advisors in total who need to seek out such conferences, given the ongoing shift of advisors to various forms of independent and 'supported independence' models, where the home-office mothership no longer necessarily provides all, and advisors have the flexibility and need to find their own conferences to engage with. Such that the total market of advisors seeking potential conferences has increased, making it more and more feasible for conference organizers to create increasingly specialized conferences and still be able to attract a critical mass of attendees in that focused domain. Consequently, while membership associations were the dominant leaders of industry conferences in the past, most membership association events have had flat or declining conference participation for more than a decade, and today's landscape is increasingly populated by events that are more and more focused in some particular domain where they can specialize and be 'the best' for their ideal advisor constituency. Some have organized around topical areas – from taxes to technology to marketing – while others have focused more on practice management needs and particular profiles of advisors depending on the stage and focus of the business (from marketing to mergers \u0026 acquisitions to succession planning). The end result is that a new wave of events have been able to grow simultaneously by using their specialization to draw advisors away from more 'generalist' (e.g., membership association) conferences, serving the expanded market of increasingly specialized financial advisors in pursuit of their own professional development, networking, and community. Finding The 'Best' Advisor Conference (For You) While there are more conference organizers than ever competing for advisor attention, the reality is that there have always been far more conferences to choose from than most advisors can ever attend, leading to questions about which ones are actually good events worth attending. No one wants to go to a conference just to find out if it's a conference that is actually worth their time in the first place, only to discover that they wasted a few thousand dollars and the better part of a week learning that the event wasn't really able to deliver as promised. To help navigate this challenge, since 2012, we've published an annual list of the Best Financial Advisor Conferences, based on my own experience speaking at nearly 1,000 conferences over the past 20 years, and having seen first-hand which events are particularly good and worth recommending (or not)… and which are the best fit (or not) for any particular type of advisor. However, in an era where conferences themselves are increasingly specialized, it's not enough to simply highlight which events are well-executed. It's also about understanding the intended focus of the conference, which shapes the agenda and its speaker selection, as well as the host/organizer of the conference (which can be especially good if the focus of the conference is in their sweet spot, or especially bad if it's not). Such that in the end, the 'best' conference is, more than ever, only determined relative to the advisor themselves and whatever their own needs are. Accordingly, in this year's list of Best Conferences, we focus more than ever on the particular specialization of the conference, or the particular type of advisor, who would likely find that conference most relevant to their individual advisor needs and circumstances! Best Overall Financial Planning Conference: FPA NorCal 2025 The FPA NorCal conference is hosted annually by a coalition of about half a dozen Financial Planning Association chapters in the Northern California/greater San Francisco area. Yet despite being a regional conference hosted by a number of 'local FPA chapters', NorCal's finely tuned systems and processes for planning and executing the event – that have been running for more than 50 (!) years since its founding as a conference in 1972 – ensure that the conference is consistently, year after year, a national-caliber financial planning event. The typical NorCal conference agenda anchors around nationally recognized keynote speakers from investment experts like Schwab's Liz Ann Sonders, Franklin Templeton's Michael Hasenstab, and Ariel Investments' Mellody Hobson, to business experts and authors like Greg McKeown of Essentialism and Cal Newport of Deep Work, and inspiring pioneers like Salman Khan of Khan Academy and figure-skater-turned-philanthropist Kristi Yamaguchi, paired with a series of 5 parallel breakout tracks of financial planning content. The content features a mixture of practice management sessions along with more technical CE, many of which run 75–100 minutes (not just the 'usual' 50-minute CE session) to allow room for the speakers to delve deeper into their topics. Which is welcomed, because the FPA NorCal conference has a rigorous speaker selection and vetting process, and does not permit any 'pay-to-play' sponsored sessions… which makes it a lineup of speakers that advisors actually would want to listen to longer! In fact, often, the biggest challenge at NorCal is that you'll want to see multiple sessions that conflict with each other in the same time slot – for which NorCal was also one of the first industry conferences to pioneer the effort of recording every session (general and all breakout sessions), making all recordings of all sessions included as part of the registration fee for all attendees. (So even if you can't attend every session in person, you'll get every bit of content as a registered attendee!) An added benefit of the NorCal conference is that it's held at the beautiful Palace Hotel in downtown San Francisco and always falls on the Tuesday and Wednesday after Memorial Day… making FPA NorCal a great 'destination' conference to claim a deductible business expense for the flight but starting the trip with a long Memorial Day weekend in San Francisco (or if you prefer, perhaps visiting the wineries of Napa and Sonoma Valleys). And for those who like to use their points, the Palace Hotel is now a Marriott property! The one important caveat, though, is that because NorCal started out as a regional conference and has morphed into a national event, it does have a capacity limitation (the main ballroom of the Palace Hotel caps out at approximately 600 attendees), so those who are interested should register early because the event has sold out in many years past! Who Should Attend: Experienced financial advisors who really want to attend high-quality conference sessions and are looking for a well-run event (or those who simply want a nice destination conference to travel with a significant other!?). Details: May 27–28, 2025, at The Palace Hotel in San Francisco, CA. Cost: Pricing to be announced. Conference Website: FPA NorCal 2025 While historically, independent financial advisors had very few choices of technology to use in their advisory firms – since the 'best' technology was built by the biggest enterprises (wirehouses and the like) as proprietary software for their own advisors – in recent years, the technology landscape has blossomed, to the point that today the Kitces AdvisorTech Map tracks nearly 500 different technology solutions for financial advisors. Yet, with more choices than ever comes more due diligence responsibility to vet and compare more vendors than ever, such that many advisory firms actually report it's more challenging to pick the 'right' technology solution today than it was a decade or two ago, when advisors were compelled to pick from often no more than 2–3 homegrown solutions in each major category. In other words, what was once a difficulty in just finding solutions (given that most advisor technology companies simply haven't been able to afford the exhibitor booths at traditional advisor conferences, where vendors selling $29/month software are often expected to pay the same exhibitor fees as trillion-dollar asset managers) has now turned into a difficulty in comparing solutions (where few advisors want to spend hours going through sales calls and demos with each of half a dozen vendors or more). And helping advisors navigate through this landscape, since the beginning, is a newsletter-turned-conference originated by advisor-technology consultants Joel Bruckenstein and David Drucker, which they dubbed \"Technology Tools for Today\" (T3). And after more than 20 years, the T3 Advisor Technology conference is still the leading conference for advisor technology… though to be accurate, it is arguably less of a 'conference' (where advisors attend sessions for educational content) and more of a 'trade show' where advisors come to see the latest wares in the exhibit hall, and attend sessions that are almost exclusively presented by the vendors/sponsors. Which, at most advisor conferences, would be a bad thing – vendors selling their wares from the stage instead of providing advisor education – but, in the case of T3, is exactly what advisors want: an opportunity to see, one vendor after another, showcases of their recent releases (what they've spent the past year building) and their roadmap (what they're working on in the coming years). Because that's the whole point of a trade show for advisor technology! In that vein, the best way for advisors to approach the T3 conference is as a comparison-browsing trip – a chance to walk amongst the exhibit hall booths to see multiple leading providers in any particular category where the advisory firm needs a new solution, and get on-the-spot demos and walkthroughs to evaluate which few vendors they'd like to explore further with their team in a formal vetting process after returning home from the conference. And perhaps get the chance to see something entirely new that is debuting at T3 for the first time. Which can be done in a time-efficient manner by attending the T3 conference, as it's the largest gathering of independent technology providers all in one place for advisors to 'shop' efficiently! For tech vendors that are deciding whether to participate, it's notable that even by 'trade show' standards, the T3 conference is still not a 'huge' buying audience for companies looking for new users (historically, as much as half of the ~1,000 attendees are fellow software vendors, media representatives, and industry consultants). Though the conference does typically attract not only individual advisors but also technology decision-makers at larger advisor enterprises (e.g., mega-RIAs and independent broker-dealers) who present more of a seat-count opportunity than 'just' the raw attendee headcount of T3. Still, in practice, the primary 'ROI' for software vendors that exhibit at T3 is measured not in the number of new users, but as a chance to gain better visibility amongst industry 'influencers' (as T3 has historically been very well covered by industry media and independent consultants who make enterprise recommendations), and the potential to establish relationships with other tech vendors that might be future integration partners (or even future strategic acquirers!). Who Should Attend: Advisory firm owners (or their technology decision-makers in larger advisor enterprises) who are either independent or making the transition to independence and want an efficient way to see the full breadth of advisor technology solutions all in one place. Details: March 3–6, 2025, in Dallas, Texas. Cost: $1,099. Early bird pricing of $999 is available until November 27. Nerd's Eye View readers can receive $200 off with the T3KITCES discount code! Conference Website: T3 Advisor Technology Conference 2025 Best Advanced Tax Planning Conference: PFP Track At AICPA ENGAGE 2025 Over the past decade, the ever-present pressure on financial advisors to show their value – increasingly showing value beyond 'just' the results of their managed accounts – has driven advisory firms towards expanding their financial planning capabilities, producing increasingly deep and comprehensive financial plans, and expanding their services beyond the 'traditional' insurance and investment realms further into the world of estate and tax planning. As exemplified by the rapid expansion of estate planning solutions for advisors on the Kitces AdvisorTech Map, and the explosive upward growth of Holistiplan's tax planning software in our recent AdvisorTech Research in particular. Yet, the reality is that as financial advisors are increasingly migrating towards a deeper level of estate and tax planning advice, the CPA world has been migrating increasingly towards financial planning. Which isn't entirely new – in practice, many of the largest RIAs today were formed by former CPAs who broke out of the High-Net-Worth (HNW) planning divisions of Big-8 accounting firms back in the 1980s and 1990s to form their own wealth management firms. In fact, the growth of this 'other world' of CPA financial planners from the accounting world long ago spawned their own membership association – the Personal Financial Planning (PFP) section of the AICPA. And the PFP section of the AICPA hosts its own financial planning conference (historically known as the AICPA PFP conference, and now the PFP track within the broader AICPA ENGAGE conference, which brings together multiple sections/divisions of CPAs within the AICPA). The significance of the PFP track at AICPA ENGAGE is that it's not 'just' another financial planning conference from an industry association; given the AICPA's deep roots in tax (as the membership association for CPAs), it has a particularly deep technical focus (as the base knowledge to become a CPA forms a high bar for a continuing education conference to build upon!) and an especially strong orientation on advanced tax planning in particular. An added bonus in the context of financial planners seeking more advanced planning content is that because the PFP track lives under the umbrella of the broader AICPA ENGAGE conference, advisors who register to attend ENGAGE also get access to the other tracks… which include a few that are not relevant at all to financial advisors (e.g., Corporate Finance and Controllers, Advanced Accounting and Auditing), but 2 other tracks that would likely be of interest: the \"Advanced Estate Planning\" track and the \"Tax Strategies for the High-Income Individual\" track. And these are not just 'tracks' akin to a series of single breakout sessions at a larger conference; Advanced Estate and High-Income Tax Strategies were, for many years, entire conferences unto themselves that, similar to the PFP conference, were rolled into ENGAGE, and have their own robust content agendas within their ENGAGE track. Because the AICPA ENGAGE conference is a broader CPA event – with a number of tracks that have no particular crossover relevance to financial advisors – it is notable that the attendee mix at ENGAGE is very broad. Which, in practice, makes it somewhat difficult to engage (no pun intended) in networking as an attendee. But for advisors who are simply looking for more advanced and deep technical content – particularly with a tax planning bent – the AICPA's ENGAGE conference and its PFP (and Advanced Estate and High-Income Tax) tracks are a strong offering, with 3- and 4-day passes available to attend all the content! Who Should Attend: Financial advisors with CFP certification (and ideally other advanced degrees and designations) who are looking for more advanced technical and tax planning content to challenge them, particularly with a focus on HNW/ultra-HNW clientele. (Note: having a CPA license is not required – this is tax planning content, not tax preparation). Details: June 9-12, 2025, in Las Vegas, NV. Cost: $1,845 for AICPA members and $2,295 for nonmembers. Early bird pricing of $1,545 for AICPA members and $1,995 for nonmembers is available until October 31. Conference Website: AICPA ENGAGE 2025 Best Advisor Marketing: Snappy Kraken's Jolt The conventional view of organic growth is that Marketing's job is to make the phone ring, and Sales is what you do when you answer it. In the context of financial advisors, though, the idea of the phone ringing with prospects who call you is akin to taking a boat out onto the lake and just waiting for the fish to jump in. If you want to actually catch some fish, you have to cast the rod and try to reel them in, just as financial advisors have to get out there and cold-call, cold-knock, network, or engage in some similar prospecting approach to bring the business in. However, at least some advisory firms are increasingly discovering that it really is possible to engage in marketing that builds a brand and draws prospects in, without needing to go out to find them one by one. From Ken Fisher, who is legendary within the industry for building his $275B of AUM almost entirely through direct mail marketing (to a recent valuation of nearly $13B of enterprise value), to Josh Brown and the Ritholtz Wealth team, who have grown to more than $5B of AUM primarily through their social media, blogging, and traditional media efforts, more and more success stories are emerging of advisors who build marketing funnels that attract their ideal prospects to them and make the phone ring (or at least make the email inbox alert with a new message). The added appeal of this approach for many advisory firms as they grow is that it allows the advisory firm to separate 'sales' from 'service'… alleviating the need to find financial advisors who are good enough at business development to grow the firm (but not so good that they'd go create their own firm!?), and instead allowing the firm to hire advisors who will focus on simply providing good service to existing clients, and a separate marketing team whose job is to get those clients in the door in the first place. However, up until just the past few years, there really were no conferences for financial advisors focused on marketing (actual marketing, as distinct from just engaging in more outbound prospecting/sales strategies). But in 2022, Robert Sofia (formerly of marketing consulting firm Platinum Advisor Strategies, and now CEO of marketing technology solution Snappy Kraken) launched the Jolt conference, specifically focused not on advisor prospecting and sales, but truly on Advisor Marketing, with an agenda that covers a wide range of marketing topics from creating content that engages with prospects, to the ways to leverage various emails and social channels to get it out there, to the data that advisors should track to measure results and iterate improvement. Notably, the Jolt agenda does have a fairly heavy focus on digital marketing in particular – which isn't entirely surprising, given that Sofia's Snappy Kraken is a digital marketing solution for advisors. Still, though, the agenda itself features a wide range of advisors with experience and expertise in advisor marketing – it's not just the Snappy Kraken team selling their wares and includes a number of advisors sharing their own \"How I Did It\"-style marketing success stories – and, in the end, addresses how scalable marketing necessitates building systems and leveraging technology to implement it. For which Snappy Kraken is already one of the more popular solutions on the Kitces AdvisorTech Map. So if advisors are going to look for advisor marketing content, why not get it from an event that has the solutions to actually help implement those ideas? Who Should Attend: Financial advisors who are trying to figure out \"how to make the phone ring\" with a marketing process that attracts prospects to them (rather than going out to market) and are ready to try something different from traditional referral-based and networking tactics for business development. Details: June 9-11, 2025, in Nashville, TN. Cost: $1,207. Early bird pricing of $957 is available through January 31. Nerd's Eye View readers can receive 10% off with the KITCES discount code! Conference Website: Jolt Conference 2025 Best For New Financial Planners: FPA NexGen 2025 As financial advisor career tracks slowly but steadily continue to shift from \"eat what you kill\" business development roles from day 1, and into roles where advisors join existing advisory firms or teams as paraplanners or associate advisors, the industry's ability to attract and retain young talent has never been better. The bad news, however, is that starting out from day 1 as an employee advisor often means far less flexibility and control of your time, and a loss of access to the broader financial advisor community as more and more time is simply spent within the firm's own 4 walls and not out at various networking meetings. To fill this void of lost community and networking opportunities for young advisors, NexGen was first born 20 years ago. Now part of the Financial Planning Association, the FPA NexGen community includes more than 2,000 financial planners who are still in the first decade of their careers, who share their experiences and provide support for each other through a combination of a private message forum and an annual conference called the FPA NexGen Gathering. Notably, though, the FPA NexGen Gathering conference is not like traditional financial advisor conferences that are focused on technical sessions for earning CE credits (there are only a handful on the agenda) or 'practice management' (since more and more NexGen advisors are employees, not independent practitioners or business owners at the early stage of their careers). Instead, the content of NexGen is focused on what actually matters to NexGen advisors – which is primarily about personal/career development, effectively growing yourself and your career, and navigating the dynamics of trying to climb the ladder and 'make partner' as an employee at an independent advisory firm. Which is built around \"Cohort\" groups that come together at the conference to talk about whatever they most want to talk about that is relevant to what they're dealing with in their own jobs. The FPA NexGen Gathering is a 'must attend' event for all those new financial planners trying to survive and thrive in their early years, and who want to find a community of like-minded peers all looking to build long-term successful financial planning careers. In fact, the bonds formed in NexGen are so tight that many members stay connected to their NexGen peers years later by forming study/mastermind groups (once they 'graduate' out of the community's early-career requirements). Who Should Attend: The NexGen Gathering is best suited for financial advisors in their 20s. While the conference itself does not have an age limit (unlike the overall NexGen membership), the reality is that its membership is predominantly 20-something advisors who are still starting their careers, though the event does attract some career-changers in their 30s, 40s, or 50s, who are also navigating their early-career experience. Details: August 26-28, 2025, in Orlando, FL. Cost: $575 for FPA members and $775 for non-members. Early bird pricing of $475 for FPA members and $675 for non-members is available through May 23.

Conference Website: FPA NexGen 2025 Best Conference Experience: FutureProof Festival 2025 While the nature of the content, the focus of the speakers, and the composition of the advisor attendees will vary from one advisor conference to the next, the experience of most conferences is quite similar – hosted in a large hotel ballroom or perhaps a wing of a convention center, with rows (and rows, and rows) of seating that face the speakers on stage, coffee breaks in the hallway, a buffet in a cavernous exhibit hall encircled by exhibitors, and nary a jot of sunlight unless you choose to take a break away from the conference activities and walk outside for a few minutes. And then there's FutureProof. Which doesn't even represent itself as a financial advisor conference, but instead as a 'wealth festival' hosted not just in Huntington Beach, California, but on Huntington Beach… literally, outdoors, just a few dozen feet from the lapping waves of the Pacific Ocean. (Technically, the event activities are draped on top of the beach parking lot, so advisors don't have to walk in the sand to get around. 😊) Where sessions are all presented under the warm (but not overly hot) California sun, from 5 different outdoor content stages, lunch is delivered via local food trucks, and advisors only ever have to walk back across the street to go indoors to the hotel when it's time to go to sleep. Notably, though, FutureProof isn't just a 'traditional advisor conference held outdoors'. It is, by design, a substantively more networking-oriented conference. Sessions are relatively short (most are 30 minutes), with futurist-oriented topics (apropos of the name, to help you \"Future Proof\" your practice) designed to spark conversation more so than bring answers. (And with shortened sessions, there is little-to-no CE at all.) Interspersed throughout the day are interviews with interesting talking heads of the industry (from Jeff Gundlach debating the bond market to Peter Mallouk sharing the evolution of his firm, to yours-truly sharing some of our latest Kitces Research data), along with other forms of music and entertainment in what is intended to be much more of a 'festival' than a conference in the first place. Also unique at FutureProof are their \"Breakthru\" meetings, where advisors in advance of the conference can provide an indication of the kinds of other advisors they'd like to meet while they're there, and have the opportunity to 'match' with others who are looking for someone similar, and if both people mutually agree, they are set up to meet at a series of meetup tables for a 15-minute connection (all facilitated by an app designed by the conference organizers to make it easier to match and meet). Because all meetings are by mutual agreement (both parties have to say they're interested in connecting), the meetings themselves are only 15 minutes (relatively low stakes; if it's not a good connection, just move on quickly) and the meetings are 1:1 (not overwhelming for the introverts who don't like big social crowds), advisors who attended have been incredibly upbeat that they were able to make better connections with peers at FutureProof than the 'traditional' approach of just talking to people during meals and in the hallways, hoping to meet someone with whom they could connect. In addition to using Breakthru to meet with other advisors, FutureProof also provides the option to use the app for vendor meetups (an alternative to walking the rows of exhibitor booths that also make an appearance at FutureProof). And advisors who want to meet with exhibitors, and agree to a set number of meetings, can even get their conference registration fees reduced (or, for leaders at large firms who represent significant buying opportunities for the vendors, waived entirely) in exchange for the facilitated introductions. Ultimately, though, FutureProof is such an 'un-conference' conference for financial advisors that it's remarkably hard to describe, beyond saying it is a great experience unto itself. Attending is less about the session content (though there are some sessions advisors will probably drift in and out of) and more about the social dynamic of interacting with a wide range of fellow advisors in a comfortable (and lovely outdoors not-conference-room-stuffy) environment, with a conference space (and Breakthru app) that help to facilitate good connections even for those of us who don't like big social settings. Come to FutureProof expecting to have interesting conversations with other advisors, enjoy the feeling of the warm California sun, and leave feeling refreshed after having spent a few days getting fresh air to go with the fresh conversations and fresh ideas. It's an experience unto itself. Who Should Attend: Financial advisors who want to get away from the 'traditional' conference and feel it would be refreshing to connect with others in a warm outdoor environment, with a primary value on networking and conversation with other advisors who are similarly energized. Details: September 7–10, 2025, in Huntington Beach, California. Cost: Pricing to be announced. Conference Website: FutureProof Festival 2025 Best Business Management Conferences: Match Your Event To Your Need As Michael Gerber's E-Myth famously highlighted, technicians who are good at doing a thing and set out to build a business around it eventually must learn to separate working in the business from working on the business. Which applies to anyone from a piemaker who eventually opens and runs a pie shop, to a financial advisor who starts out giving advice to clients and eventually accrues enough clients (and needs a team to serve them) that they find themselves spending more of their time running the financial advisory business itself. As a result, in recent years, there has been a growing spate of practice management conferences, dedicated to helping advisory firm owners navigate their \"working on the business\" challenges. The rise of standalone practice management conferences is notable, because historically, most advisor conferences shied away from offering practice management sessions, as practice management sessions that didn't offer continuing education credit (as practice management content isn't eligible for CE credit, per CFP Board rules) attracted far fewer attendees. Except as it turns out, the relative lack of practice management sessions at advisor conferences may simply be because a typical CE technical session – for instance, on the latest tax law changes – includes something that every advisor needs to know in order to give accurate advice to clients. While help with practice management is only relevant to a smaller subset of advisors who are actually in the position of running their own firms. Yet for those who are running their own practices, businesses, or growing enterprises, the reality is that the economic impact of good guidance that can 'merely' allow the business to grow 1% faster or be 1% more profitable can add up quickly to substantial dollars. Such that while there may be fewer advisors in a position to run their own firms and need practice management advice, those who do are often willing to pay far more for content that really, truly, is relevant and actionable for them. Accordingly, the practice management events below are highlighted in the context of where the advisory firm and its owner are in the progression of growing and sizing up their business, with the most relevant conference at each stage of firm evolution! Limitless Advisor For (High-Margin) Lifestyle Practices For most financial advisors, the goal at the end of the day is simply to serve clients well, get paid for the work we do and the value we deliver, and use the financial success of the business to lead a life we enjoy for ourselves. Except unfortunately, many financial advisors get 'stuck' in a trap, as Bill Bachrach has famously quipped, of \"doing too much work, for too many clients, for too little money\", and are uncertain about how to get unstuck. Enter Limitless Advisor. Developed by practice management coach Stephanie Bogan, the Limitless Lifestyle coaching program is a year-long engagement, with two 2-day coaching camps – 1 in the spring and 1 in the fall – punctuated by quarterly virtual summits, and ongoing coaching calls you can join, all built around how to make a highly leveraged solo practice that aims for $1M of revenue and the ability to still take off 100 days per year (or whatever your personal definition of 'success' might be!). Notably, while \"lifestyle practice\" is used as a negative term in some parts of the industry, Limitless celebrates the fact that many high-income lifestyle practices have a better take-home income than the partners at $1B+ advisory firms… with a fraction of the hours worked and stress along the way. Which means that \"high margin\", in the context of a lifestyle practice, is about both profit margins (having a high take-home income) as well as high 'personal' margins (not working an undue number of business hours to get there!). At least, for those that are able to follow the higher-margin path that Limitless teaches. Details: Year-long program with in-person and virtual. Cost: $18,000 for the full-year program (including all meetings and events). Nerd's Eye View readers receive $3,000 off with the KIT25 discount code! Conference Website: Limitless Lifestyle ClientWise Business Builders Academy For Going From Practice To Business While many financial advisors can and do build wildly successful solo practices to support our lifestyles, for some of us, there is a desire for the business to become 'bigger than just me'. Yet regardless of whether it's to have a broader reach and impact, to establish an 'enduring business' that lives beyond us, or simply to grow a larger firm to create more enterprise value and achieve our personal financial goals, there is a fundamental shift that occurs when we stop trying to simply add clients for ourselves, and instead build a business that serves clients, for which we are the owner and leader. In fact, arguably the biggest challenges to \"making the E-myth switch\" from technician working in the business to owner working primarily on the business aren't even the tools and tactics to pursue… it's the mindset changes it takes to get comfortable re-visioning your own role and relationship with the business. After all, best practices in expanding the team of advisors don't really matter if you aren't comfortable letting go of some client relationships in the first place. And as a result, often the events and platforms that best teach advisors how to make the transition come from the realm of business coaches, like ClientWise and their Business Builders Academy. Notably, though, Business Builders Academy is not 'just' a conference. Instead, similar to how Limitless works with solo advisors (and also has a Limitless Leaders tier), ClientWise's offering is also a year-long program that encompasses in-person 2-day workshops, coupled with monthly webinars… all of which are built around a cohort of similar-sized advisor peers (with groups at \u003c$1.5M revenue, $1.5M to $3M, and $3M to $7.5M, and separate offerings for larger multi-partner ensembles) that the advisor progresses through the program with, supported and facilitated by one of ClientWise's business coaches. Core topics that are covered throughout the year include hiring and team development, business and operations management, and organizing business priorities, in addition to exploring how the firm can best scale up its marketing, client acquisition, and client engagement/advice delivery as the advisor looks to scale the clientele far beyond 'just' themselves and their personal support team. Details: Year-long program with in-person workshops and virtual webinars. Cost: Contact organization for pricing information. Conference Website: ClientWise Business Builders Academy 2025 Veres' Insider's Forum For Mid-Sized RIAs As advisory firms continue to grow and size up their revenue and their headcount, the greater size of the firm brings more dollars to invest into resources to better support the advisors, do more for clients… and potentially create more headaches for the advisory firm leaders as the business becomes increasingly complex. And at this size, the \"Mo Money Mo Problems\" challenges are not as easy to navigate because now the advisory firm has more advisors, and often more partners, which means more stakeholders to get on board for any potential changes. For whom Bob Veres' \"Inside Information\" newsletter has long been a practice management go-to for independent RIAs in particular. Covering everything from emerging technology that helps advisory firms run more efficiently, to new business management and team structures to better scale, Veres has spent more than 30 years studying and writing about best practices for financial advisors. And several years ago, he launched the Insider's Forum conference to further extend the practice management learning from newsletter to in-person event. Unlike most conferences that accept a wide range of speakers and vendors, though, Veres not only rigorously vets the particular consultants who speak, but also includes a number of successful advisors who can speak from experience about actually implementing their ideas (not just hypotheticals of what advisors 'should' do, but what they have actually done), and Veres also hand-picks the vendors for the exhibit hall to specifically be relevant for his target audience: mid-sized advisory firms and the C-level leadership who run them. Details: Date and location to be announced. Cost: Pricing to be announced. Conference Website: Bob Veres' Insider's Forum 2025 FutureProof Retreat For Multi-Advisor Enterprises The larger an advisory firm becomes, the less clear the answers tend to be. At some point, advisory firms move away from the 'standard' playbook of how to start, run, grow, and scale the business, and into a realm where every business is a function of its unique offering, positioning, team, leadership, and its history of decisions that led it to the point where it is. The significance of this shift is that for leaders of growing multi-advisor enterprises, as their business grows to 20, 50, and eventually 100+ team members, learning as a leader is less about just trying to find 'the answer' and more about simply trying to broaden their perspective to understand the way it's been done at other firms, so they can try to figure out what applies, or not, based on their own firm's unique needs and circumstances. Which means it's crucial to be amongst peers who are navigating similar problems. And this is the exact audience that the FutureProof Retreat event is targeting. As contrasted with the original FutureProof \"Festival\" event – which quickly gained buzz as a large-scale outdoor event hosted on Huntington Beach – FutureProof Retreat is a much smaller more intimate event (with 'just' about 500 attendees), targeted specifically at the executives of multi-advisor enterprises, who want to network, share and learn from, and simply spend time with, others who are dealing with similar challenges. Accordingly, the FutureProof Retreat is notable not just for a very advisor-leader-peer-oriented agenda, but also for the way it hosts networking events and 'experiences' with the other attendees in enjoyable social environments that allow for more time to connect with others (think networking dinners, beer/wine tasting events, learning how to make sushi together, etc.). Notably, for those looking for a deeper program to learn how to scale through and overcome their challenges as a larger advisor enterprise, ClientWise's Business Builders Academy and its year-long coaching program also have a multi-partner ensemble tier (in addition to its Leaders program for individual firm owners noted earlier). Details: May 12–15, 2025, in Colorado Springs, CO. Cost: Qualified hosted advisors receive free tickets and a travel stipend. Conference Website: FutureProof Retreat 2025 DeVoe Elevate For Developing Next Generation Talent Like any professional services business, once a financial advisory firm grows materially beyond the ability of 'just' its founder to serve clients and becomes a multi-advisor business, it will ultimately live or die by its ability to attract, develop, and retain high-quality talent. As while technology may provide incremental efficiencies, we can't automate all of the people out of the business, or we'd 'just' be a technology company selling software for a monthly fee. Consumers hire financial advisors, and the firms they work for, to receive services beyond what technology alone can automate or provide. To help address these challenges, practice management consultant David DeVoe created the DeVoe Elevate conference, with a specific focus on helping advisory firm leaders figure out how best to manage the people in their business and develop their human capital. Notably, unlike most other financial advisor conferences, 'industry consultants' are remarkably absent from the DeVoe Elevate agenda; instead, the content comprises almost entirely panels of leaders from other large advisory firms, sharing how they've navigated the people challenges in their businesses, with sessions like \"How to Build a High-Growth Organization\", \"Creating a Culture to Attract and Retain Top Talent\", and \"Strategies for Solving Next-Gen Financing\". Details: May 7–9, 2025, in Nashville, TN. Cost: $1,125. Early bird pricing of $795 is available through February 16. Nerd's Eye View readers receive $300 off the RIA rate with the Kitces300 discount code! Conference Website: DeVoe Elevate 2025 G2 Institute For Next Generation Leaders The founders of advisory firms are truly unique people. Like most entrepreneurs, they have to bear a relatively high tolerance for risk to even take the chance of starting the business. They have to be comfortable with the constantly changing demands on their time as the business asks for (and takes!) what it needs from them to be successful. All while carrying the load of going out to find and bring in all the revenue, and (at least in the early years) providing all of the servicing to the clients as well. Which creates a significant gap whenever the next generation of leaders comes along in the same advisory firm. As, almost by definition, the next generation \"G2\" leadership has not followed the path of the G1 founder – what the G1 founder had to build with their own 2 hands, the G2 leader joined once it was already established. In fact, the irony is that if the G2 leader wanted to build a business from scratch with their own hands, they probably wouldn't be working for the G1 founder in the first place! As a result, G1 founders often struggle greatly to teach G2 successors to be successful, as G2 tends to have very different interests and preferences in how to run the business. Which isn't necessarily bad – in fact, as the business becomes more established, it can help to systematize and scale the business to not have the constantly adaptive approach that many founders take. But it does mean that G2 needs a place to learn, which G1 can't always provide. To fill this void, practice management guru Philip Palaveev of the Ensemble Practice created his G2 Leadership Institute, to help those next-generation leaders who didn't choose to take the entrepreneurial journey from scratch but want to become leaders of an established, successful, growing business that still needs help and new leadership to get to the next level from here. Similar to Limitless Lifestyle or ClientWise's Business Builders Academy, Palaveev's G2 Leadership Institute is an extended coaching program (it actually runs for 2 full years), with a combination of monthly learning sessions, 2 in-person gatherings each year, and MBA-style group work with fellow G2 leaders working through case studies of real-world business challenges. All built to help next-generation leaders get more opportunities to develop, learn, and practice their leadership skills. Details: 2-year program with semi-annual in-person and monthly virtual sessions. Cost: $14,000 for the full 2-year program (including all meetings and events). Conference Website: G2 Leadership Institute Bachrach's Advisor Roadmap For Business Development While some advisory firms are beginning to separate the sales/business development aspects of the business from the advisors who service and manage ongoing client relationships, the reality is that most advisory firms still expect their advisors – or at least, their most senior advisors – to do a significant amount of new client business development. For advisors who have been in the business for more than 15 years, virtually all of them started out in an \"eat what you kill\" business development role, and the reality is that if they're still in the business today, they either have some natural business development skillset or were able to learn it enough through the school of hard knocks. However, many 'newer' advisors, even with 5–10+ years of experience, may have had very little need to do or learn business development. Which is fine when they're in service-advisor roles supporting senior advisors, but it becomes more problematic as both the advisors want to move up to senior/partner roles (that now require business development to reach the next level), and advisory firms grow to the point that they need more advisors engaged in business development to support the overall growth of the firm. Fortunately, Bill Bachrach has been teaching financial advisors how to explain their value proposition to prospective clients and persuade them to do business with the advisor for nearly 30 years. With a particular gift of finding the right words to use when talking to prospects that helps get them comfortable with paying for the value of financial planning advice, Bachrach developed an \"Advisor Roadmap\" system of training advisors – new and experienced – to better attract and engage with prospective clients. Nominally, Bachrach's Advisor Roadmap is an on-demand virtual learning platform, but given the time it takes to really learn and practice the skills, enrollment is structured as an annual fee… which is a fair reflection of how long it takes an advisor to practice and cement a new set of business development skills (and the opportunity to refer back to Bachrach's material as they practice!). Details: 1-year access to the on-demand Advisor Roadmap learning platform. Cost: $2,500 for the annual membership. Nerd's Eye View readers can receive 20% off with the KITCES discount code! Conference Website: Advisor Roadmap Up-And-Coming Conferences Of Note Notwithstanding the fact that there are a lot of advisor conferences out there – so many that we need to make an annual Best Conferences list to sort through them all, and a Master Conference List to organize them – there are still more new conferences emerging. In the current environment, though, this isn't entirely surprising – the more that advisors and their teams and firms continue to specialize in their roles and offerings and target clientele, the more opportunity there will be for new conferences to emerge to provide a specialized event for the needs of that particular group. To that end, we highlight a few emerging up-and-coming conferences, most of which are too new to give a formal 'review' as an ongoing event (or in the case of one that hasn't even launched its first event), but given their clear focus, may still be of interest for particular advisors who are a fit for their specialized content! SWAY | LIVE For Personal Advisor Branding Most financial advisors grow by learning business development and then going out to get clients, and a few now have centralized marketing and business development teams to bring in the clients for other advisors in the firm to serve. But a few financial advisors try to live at the intersection of the 2 – building their own personal brands to market themselves and their services – in the hopes of attracting prospective clients to them. And now, a conference has arisen specifically for those advisors. The SWAY | LIVE conference, organized by advisor marketing expert Sheri Fitts, is specifically designed for those advisors who want to learn how to have more 'sway' over the people they reach – in essence, how to develop their personal brand to perhaps someday become a 'finfluencer' (of the good knowledgeable fiduciary financial advisor kind!) who can attract prospective clients to their expertise because of the personal brand they've built. Details: August 3–5, 2025, in Milwaukee, WI Cost: $997. Early bird pricing of $797 is available through November 29. Conference Website: SWAY | LIVE 2025 Retirement Tax Summit For Advisor Tax Planning (But Not Tax Prep!) One of the fundamental challenges of financial planning is that much of its value is very long term, and while it is truly valuable, it's difficult to tell clients \"You're going to pay me these fees for the next 30 years, but trust me you're totally going to appreciate it in the long run.\" (Even if it really is true!) As a result, we often try other ways to show more tangible, nearer-term value… while we can quickly get caught in the trap of talking about investment returns and pursuing (relative) outperformance. Except when it comes to tax planning. Which, by virtue of the IRS' annual filing requirements, is a chance to show value to clients every year. And this can be demonstrated in very concrete dollars (\"Mr. and Mrs. Client, I saved you $4,216 in taxes last year!\"), leading more and more financial advisors to engage in proactive tax planning with clients (which they can do even if they aren't a licensed CPA or Enrolled Agent, as long as they don't stray into formal Tax Advice opinion letters, and their firms otherwise permit it). To help advisors dig deeper into tax planning, Retirement Tax Services (which provides outsourced tax preparation for financial advisors' clients) developed a Retirement Tax Summit event. The 2-day agenda is entirely focused on how to more effectively implement tax planning in an advisor's practice, including not just the technical knowledge of how to review a tax return, but best practices in how to more systematically work with a client's CPA and engage in tax reviews as an annual value-add deliverable for clients. Details: October 1–3, 2025, in Phoenix, AZ Cost: Pricing to be announced. Conference Website: Retirement Tax Summit 2025 AdviseAI For Leveraging AI In Your Advisory Firm While artificial intelligence has not quite 'taken over' the job of a financial advisor (and any/every other professional services job) the way that OpenAI supporters suggested it would, it's hard to deny that AI will play a major role in reshaping our lives as individuals – and our jobs as financial advisors – in the years to come. Akin to the rise of the computer, the internet, and the smartphone, AI seems to have the capability to drastically change the way we work and live. Even if no one is quite sure how, exactly, it's going to play out. To create a space for that conversation, though, and to convene all those who are excited about the potential, Arizent convened their first AdviseAI conference in the fall of 2024, to bring together experts on AI, vendors creating AI-driven solutions for financial advisors, and financial advisors themselves who want to learn more about AI and explore how they might begin to implement it into their firms. In the long run, it seems likely that AI will eventually weave itself into the fabric of everything we do – and that we won't talk about 'AI-based' software, akin to how we no longer distinguish that a software provider is 'internet-based' (even though that was a big deal when the internet first showed up and advisors considered whether to move their software and data from in-office servers to the cloud!). But for at least the next few years, AI is going to continue to be a major conversation, and AdviseAI has been the leader thus far in claiming a space for advisors to explore what an AI-driven advisory firm might look like in the future! Details: Date and location to be announced. Cost: Pricing to be announced. Conference Website: AdviseAI 2025 FutureProof Citywide To Explore Investment Ideas One of the dominant themes in the financial advisor world in recent years has been the relative commoditization of building diversified asset-allocated portfolios, and a rising focus on advisors demonstrating their value through financial planning (and the related retirement and tax planning opportunities in particular). However, the reality is that there is still a segment of advisory firms that differentiate themselves at least in part by their investment acumen, whether it's their ability to actively manage client portfolios, or to find appealing investment opportunities for them. For which there is no shortage of asset managers who are seeking opportunities of their own to show their new investment ideas to financial advisors. And so, in addition to its now-popular FutureProof Festival event, the makers of FutureProof have also developed FutureProof Citywide, an event based in Miami (as contrasted with the FutureProof Festival in southern California), that aims to convene all those who touch the investment ecosystem (from advisory firms to asset managers, family offices to PE firms raising capital, and more). Notably, FutureProof Citywide is not intended to be an outdoor experience like FutureProof Festival – instead, it will be 'citywide' taking down a series of more than a dozen hotels clustered together around Miami's South Beach – but is still intended to leverage the same Breakthru Meetings system to facilitate a high level of networking and the opportunity to meet new people (of mutual interest, as Breakthru Meetings still require mutual agreement), in addition to its investment content. Details: March 16-19, 2025, in Miami Beach, FL. Cost: $1,045, with early bird discounts available. Nerd's Eye View readers can receive 20% off through this registration link. Conference Website: FutureProof Citywide 2025 While many financial advisors decide to go to a conference to solve a particular problem – whether it's an educational gap or a practice management/business need – sometimes the reality is that the reason to attend is little more than spending time with 'your people'… the community of advisors that you belong to and wish to (re-)connect with. Which makes the conference less of a conference, per se, and more about 'going home' to your community. For most advisors, their 'home' conference is the annual conference of their RIA custodian or broker-dealer platform (which is why events like Schwab IMPACT and LPL Focus are some of the largest conferences in the industry), or the advisor platform they work with (e.g., XYPN LIVE or Dynasty Partners Summit). With the added benefit that not only is it an opportunity to talk to and network (and perhaps to commiserate) with fellow advisors using the same platform, but it's also an opportunity for the advisors on those respective platforms to see the latest services and capabilities their platforms are rolling out, hear what senior leadership are focused on (or have a chance to ask questions and express concerns), and meet home office staff as well. Not to mention that because advisors with a shared platform tend to have a similar business model and often a similar 'profile' (which makes them a fit for that platform), the other advisors in attendance tend to be reasonably similar and good to network with. In turn, the rise of vendor conferences is also creating a new kind of 'home' community conference, at least where the technology platform tends to form a major hub around which the advisor's practice is built. Examples include the Envestnet Advisor Summit, Orion Ascent, Nitrogen's Fearless Investing Summit, and eMoney's Advisor Conference. Which again offers opportunities for good networking (advisors using similar systems tend to share other commonalities that give them good chances to share best practices), as well as for hearing the latest and greatest from their vendors and key leadership. And so for advisors who otherwise aren't certain what conference to attend in 2025, there's no place like home as the conference of choice. Or alternatively, multi-advisor firms may wish to divide and conquer, with one advisor going to their home conference and another going to something new for 2025!  So what do you plan to attend?

Once the domain of membership associations that, especially amongst independent financial advisors, created a central space for networking and community, conferences were primarily built around professional development (i.e., continuing education) and often held a space for the vendors who served those advisors, with organizations like the Financial Planning Association convening the largest conferences for financial advisors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut over the past 20 years, the shift from commission-based to recurring revenue (AUM and subscription fee) models has, for the first time, allowed advisory firms to begin to size and scale up. What was primarily an industry of eat-what-you-kill solo financial advisors and their administrative staff has increasingly evolved into multi-advisor firms with a wider base of support staff, and increasingly specialized roles within the advisory firms as staged career tracks emerge, departments form, and greater levels of complexity develop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result of this increasing role specialization within advisory firms, conferences \u003cem\u003efor \u003c/em\u003efinancial advisors have also become increasingly specialized over the past decade. Broad-based conferences that simply convened advisors because they were engaged in financial planning or operating as independents have given way to a plethora of more targeted events, from conferences \u0026#39;just\u0026#39; on tax planning to events focused on advisor technology, to those hyper-targeting financial advisors at certain stages of business who are seeking peers of the exact same size to discuss best practices about how to deal with their business complexities. These discussions can range from talent development and succession planning to how to systematize and scale their marketing alongside their planning and investment services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsequently, the irony is that there seem to be even \u003cem\u003emore \u003c/em\u003econferences for financial advisors today than there were a decade ago (when many lamented that there were \u0026#39;too many\u0026#39; conferences to choose from!). However, the good and bad news of this evolution is that because conferences are more specialized than ever, there\u0026#39;s even more opportunity to get value out of a \u0026#39;good-fit\u0026#39; conference… and it\u0026#39;s even more of a waste of time to go to an event that is \u003cem\u003enot \u003c/em\u003ea good fit for the advisor\u0026#39;s needs and circumstances!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs someone who has been speaking at 50–70 conferences a year for 20 years myself, I\u0026#39;ve seen the good and bad of our wide range of industry events, from the industry associations to the broker-dealers and insurance companies and RIA custodians, the rise of vendor conferences and media-driven events, private company events, and more. As a result, I am often asked for my own suggestions of what, really, are the industry\u0026#39;s \u0026#39;best\u0026#39; conferences to attend, and back in 2012, I started to craft my own annual list of \u0026#39;best-in-class\u0026#39; top conferences for financial advisors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving updated our annual conference list every year since, I\u0026#39;m excited now to present my newest list of \u0026#34;Top Financial Advisor Conferences\u0026#34; for the upcoming 2025 year, with a particular focus on highlighting how advisors can find the \u0026#39;right\u0026#39; conference that fits their interests and business needs, from events on advisor technology (and one dedicated specifically to AI!), to conferences on marketing, learning business development skills, or developing next generation talent, to the top events for those who still use conferences to up their technical game in areas like tax planning. Plus a few events that are simply great well-rounded experiences for those who want to enjoy the conference, the destination, the sessions they attend, and their fellow attendees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, we\u0026#39;ve also updated our popular \u0026#34;Master Conference List\u0026#34; for all financial advisor conferences we could find for 2025, both for advisors looking for a wider range of events to attend (if you want to delve deeper into a particular topical area) and for vendors looking for more conferences to exhibit at! (And as more conferences are announced in the coming months, we\u0026#39;ll continue to update the Master Conference List well into the coming year!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I hope you\u0026#39;ll find this year\u0026#39;s 2025 top conferences list (and our updated Master Conference List) to be helpful as a guide in planning your own conference budget and schedule for next year, and be certain to take advantage of the special discount codes that several conferences have offered to all of you as Nerd\u0026#39;s Eye View readers!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg width=\"200\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-200x200.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Kitces\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-800x800.jpg 800w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP.jpg 1022w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-src=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-200x200.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP-800x800.jpg 800w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Michael-Kitces-Profile-WP.jpg 1022w\" data-old-src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"\u003eMichael Kitces is Head of Planning Strategy at \u003ca href=\"https://buckinghamstrategicwealth.com/michael-kitces?utm_source=Kitces\u0026amp;utm_medium=KitcesReferral\u0026amp;utm_campaign=ForConsumers\u0026amp;utm_id=Kitces\"\u003eBuckingham Strategic Wealth\u003c/a\u003e, which provides an evidence-based approach to private wealth management for near- and current retirees, and \u003ca href=\"https://buckinghamstrategicpartners.com/kitces/?utm_source=Kitces\u0026amp;utm_medium=KitcesReferral\u0026amp;utm_campaign=ForConsumers\u0026amp;utm_id=Kitces\"\u003eBuckingham Strategic Partners\u003c/a\u003e, a turnkey wealth management services provider supporting thousands of independent financial advisors through the scaling phase of growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, he is a co-founder of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.xyplanningnetwork.com/\"\u003eXY Planning Network\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://advicepay.com/\"\u003eAdvicePay\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.fppathfinder.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003efpPathfinder\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://newplannerrecruiting.com/\"\u003eNew Planner Recruiting\u003c/a\u003e, the former Practitioner Editor of the Journal of Financial Planning, the host of the \u003cem\u003eFinancial Advisor Success \u003c/em\u003epodcast, and the publisher of \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/\"\u003ethe popular financial planning industry blog \u003cem\u003eNerd’s Eye View\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e through his website \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/\"\u003eKitces.com\u003c/a\u003e, dedicated to advancing knowledge in financial planning.

In other words, planning-centric advisors wanted to talk to others who were focused first and foremost on financial planning, while AUM-based advisors at an RIA wanted to compare themselves to other AUM-based RIAs, insurance agents working on a commission wanted to talk to other insurance agents about what was working for them, and the investment management consultants working with pension plan investment committees wanted to commiserate with others doing the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo meet these needs, industry membership associations arose. By virtue of their varying membership requirements and who chose to join which ones, the advisors who affiliated with these organizations chose the ones that were aligned with what they did and whom they served, and consequently, ended up naturally sharing many commonalities – FPA members were financial-planning oriented and NAPFA members were fee-only (and thus also had to be with an RIA), while NAIFA members were affiliated with insurance companies and IMCA members were typically investment management consultants serving institutional investors via large brokerage firms. And those commonalities made it easier to craft an agenda of professional development content that would be relevant to all the members, create a community of similar individuals who could share best practices, establish an environment in which the desired networking could happen, and attract the relevant vendors who wanted to be in front of that particular segment of advisors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis framework was further expedited by the fact that most financial advisors were individual practitioners running their own practices. Those who were affiliated with a larger platform – for instance, a national broker-dealer or insurance company – might have company-provided resources for professional development, and a natural community of fellow advisors to share best practices with because of their shared affiliation to the platform. However, for independent advisors in particular, there was no shared large firm with home-office resources, by virtue of being independent… and the drive for individual practitioners to share anything and everything about their practices with their peers meant conferences for independent advisors driven by membership associations they joined were the biggest events in the industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-sizing-up-of-advisory-teams\"\u003eThe Sizing Up Of Advisory Teams\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most dominant trends of the advisory industry over the past 20 years has been the shift from commissions to fees. Which is notable not just relative to the industry\u0026#39;s ongoing debates about the \u0026#39;best\u0026#39; compensation model for consumers and their associated conflicts of interest, but also simply because the transition from insurance and investment product sales for a commission to earning ongoing fees instead (either as an AUM fee or a subscription fee) from an advisory relationship gave advisory firms a recurring revenue base from which they could, for the first time, actually begin to size and scale up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, when advisors are mostly or entirely commission-based, they effectively wake up January 1st with zero (or at least, near-zero) revenue, as the clock on commissions starts over every year. In practice, there might be a small amount of trails, but there generally isn\u0026#39;t much more to cover the most basic administrative servicing requirements for existing policies or shareholders. As a result, most advisory firms historically only had 2 types of staff: financial advisors who brought in clients, and administrative staff support for their back-office needs so they could get out and find more clients. When new advisors came on board, it was always to simply be another \u0026#39;producer\u0026#39; who went out to get their own clients, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith recurring-revenue AUM or subscription fee models, though, the entire advisory business begins to change. At some point, an advisory firm owner wakes up on January 1st and might have $50M of assets under management generating $500,000 of annual revenue, for which the advisory firm \u0026#39;just\u0026#39; needs to provide great ongoing service and financial advice to retain that client. And so advisory firms, for the first time, began to hire \u0026#39;service advisors\u0026#39; whose role was \u003cem\u003enot \u003c/em\u003eto go get new clients, but instead to serve the firm\u0026#39;s existing clients. Which the advisory firm could do at less than the total amount of revenue generated, allowing for the firm owners to generate a standalone profit as an advisor enterprise, to either distribute as a dividend or to reinvest to continue to expand the staff infrastructure of the firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe end result is that while 20 years ago, the \u0026#39;average\u0026#39; advisory firm might have generated $200,000 of revenue on $20M of AUM with an advisor and their assistant, today there are advisor enterprises with millions, tens of millions, or even $100M+ in revenue, managing hundreds of millions, billions, or $10B+ in assets under management, that might employ dozens or hundreds of team members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as advisory firm teams have expanded so dramatically, so has the specialization of their roles (as is common for businesses in any industry that size up). In the past, an advisor might have gone out to get the clients, built and delivered their financial plan, and serviced them on an ongoing basis, while also managing their portfolios. Today, however, that advisory firm might have a marketing and sales team doing business development, which hands new clients off to service advisors to give advice and manage relationships, while leveraging a centralized planning team to build and maintain the client\u0026#39;s financial plans, as a dedicated investment team does all of the research, portfolio trading, and ongoing monitoring and due diligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 data-nav-title=\"Conference Specialization\" id=\"specialization-of-advisory-firms-and-roles-has-led-to-conference-specialization\"\u003eSpecialization Of Advisory Firms And Roles Has Led To Conference Specialization\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe specialization of roles that naturally emerges as advisory firms size up means that it\u0026#39;s difficult to make any single conference good for all those who call themselves \u0026#34;financial advisors\u0026#34;, primarily for 2 reasons. The first is that the role of financial advisors itself is bifurcating in many ways: between those who focus more on investments versus financial planning, getting new clients versus serving existing ones, being on teams versus leading those teams, etc. And the second is that knowledge domains are also specializing within advisory firms (as the investment team houses investment knowledge, and different advisors specialize themselves as one goes deeper on tax planning, another focuses more with business owners, a third is trying to improve the client experience across the whole advisory firm, etc.).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, there are more advisors in total who need to seek out such conferences, given the ongoing shift of advisors to various forms of independent and \u0026#39;supported independence\u0026#39; models, where the home-office mothership no longer necessarily provides all, and advisors have the flexibility and need to find their own conferences to engage with. Such that the total market of advisors seeking potential conferences has increased, making it more and more feasible for conference organizers to create increasingly specialized conferences and still be able to attract a critical mass of attendees in that focused domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsequently, while membership associations were the dominant leaders of industry conferences in the past, most membership association events have had flat or declining conference participation for more than a decade, and today\u0026#39;s landscape is increasingly populated by events that are more and more focused in some particular domain where they can specialize and be \u0026#39;the best\u0026#39; for their ideal advisor constituency. Some have organized around topical areas – from taxes to technology to marketing – while others have focused more on practice management needs and particular profiles of advisors depending on the stage and focus of the business (from marketing to mergers \u0026amp; acquisitions to succession planning).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe end result is that a new wave of events have been able to grow simultaneously by using their specialization to draw advisors away from more \u0026#39;generalist\u0026#39; (e.g., membership association) conferences, serving the expanded market of increasingly specialized financial advisors in pursuit of their own professional development, networking, and community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 data-nav-title=\"Finding The \u0026#39;Best\u0026#39; Conference (For You)\" id=\"finding-the-best-advisor-conference-for-you\"\u003eFinding The \u0026#39;Best\u0026#39; Advisor Conference (For You)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there are more conference organizers than ever competing for advisor attention, the reality is that there have always been far more conferences to choose from than most advisors can ever attend, leading to questions about which ones are \u003cem\u003eactually \u003c/em\u003egood events worth attending. No one wants to go to a conference just to find out if it\u0026#39;s a conference that is actually worth their time in the first place, only to discover that they wasted a few thousand dollars and the better part of a week learning that the event wasn\u0026#39;t really able to deliver as promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo help navigate this challenge, since 2012, we\u0026#39;ve published \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/2020-best-conferences-for-top-financial-advisors-to-choose-from/\"\u003ean annual list of the Best Financial Advisor Conferences\u003c/a\u003e, based on my own experience speaking at nearly 1,000 conferences over the past 20 years, and having seen first-hand which events are particularly good and worth recommending (or not)… and which are the best fit (or not) for any particular type of advisor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, in an era where conferences themselves are increasingly specialized, it\u0026#39;s not enough to simply highlight which events are well-executed.

Which is welcomed, because the FPA NorCal conference has a rigorous speaker selection and vetting process, and does not permit any \u0026#39;pay-to-play\u0026#39; sponsored sessions… which makes it a lineup of speakers that advisors actually would \u003cem\u003ewant \u003c/em\u003eto listen to longer!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, often, the biggest challenge at NorCal is that you\u0026#39;ll want to see multiple sessions that conflict with each other in the same time slot – for which NorCal was also one of the first industry conferences to pioneer the effort of recording \u003cem\u003eevery \u003c/em\u003esession (general and all breakout sessions), making all recordings of all sessions included as part of the registration fee for all attendees.

In other words, what was once a difficulty in just \u003cem\u003efinding \u003c/em\u003esolutions (given that most advisor technology companies simply haven\u0026#39;t been able to afford the exhibitor booths at traditional advisor conferences, where vendors selling $29/month software are often expected to pay the same exhibitor fees as trillion-dollar asset managers) has now turned into a difficulty in \u003cem\u003ecomparing \u003c/em\u003esolutions (where few advisors want to spend hours going through sales calls and demos with each of half a dozen vendors or more).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd helping advisors navigate through this landscape, since the beginning, is a newsletter-turned-conference originated by advisor-technology consultants Joel Bruckenstein and David Drucker, which they dubbed \u0026#34;Technology Tools for Today\u0026#34; (T3).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd after more than 20 years, the T3 Advisor Technology conference is still the leading conference for advisor technology… though to be accurate, it is arguably less of a \u0026#39;conference\u0026#39; (where advisors attend sessions for educational content) and more of a \u0026#39;trade show\u0026#39; where advisors come to see the latest wares in the exhibit hall, and attend sessions that are almost exclusively presented by the vendors/sponsors. Which, at most advisor conferences, would be a bad thing – vendors selling their wares from the stage instead of providing advisor education – but, in the case of T3, is exactly what advisors want: an opportunity to see, one vendor after another, showcases of their recent releases (what they\u0026#39;ve spent the past year building) and their roadmap (what they\u0026#39;re working on in the coming years).

And perhaps get the chance to see something entirely new that is debuting at T3 for the first time.

Which isn\u0026#39;t entirely new – in practice, \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/martine-lellis-weinhold-cpa-coo-sullivan-bruyette-sbsb/\"\u003emany of the largest RIAs today were formed by former CPAs\u003c/a\u003e who broke out of the High-Net-Worth (HNW) planning divisions of \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_accounting_firms#Big_Eight\"\u003eBig-8 accounting firms\u003c/a\u003e back in the 1980s and 1990s to form their own wealth management firms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, the growth of this \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/blog/aicpa-pfp-the-other-world-of-financial-planners/\"\u003e\u0026#39;other world\u0026#39; of CPA financial planners from the accounting world\u003c/a\u003e long ago spawned their own membership association – the Personal Financial Planning (PFP) section of the AICPA. And the PFP section of the AICPA hosts its own financial planning conference (historically known as the AICPA PFP conference, and now the PFP track within the broader AICPA ENGAGE conference, which brings together multiple sections/divisions of CPAs within the AICPA).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe significance of the PFP track at AICPA ENGAGE is that it\u0026#39;s not \u0026#39;just\u0026#39; another financial planning conference from an industry association; given the AICPA\u0026#39;s deep roots in tax (as the membership association for CPAs), it has a particularly deep technical focus (as the base knowledge to become a CPA forms a high bar for a continuing education conference to build upon!) and an especially strong orientation on advanced tax planning in particular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn added bonus in the context of financial planners seeking more advanced planning content is that because the PFP track lives under the umbrella of the broader AICPA ENGAGE conference, advisors who register to attend ENGAGE also get access to the other tracks… which include a few that are not relevant at all to financial advisors (e.g., Corporate Finance and Controllers, Advanced Accounting and Auditing), but 2 other tracks that \u003cem\u003ewould \u003c/em\u003elikely be of interest: the \u0026#34;Advanced Estate Planning\u0026#34; track and the \u0026#34;Tax Strategies for the High-Income Individual\u0026#34; track. And these are not just \u0026#39;tracks\u0026#39; akin to a series of single breakout sessions at a larger conference; Advanced Estate and High-Income Tax Strategies were, for many years, entire \u003cem\u003econferences \u003c/em\u003eunto themselves that, similar to the PFP conference, were rolled into ENGAGE, and have their own robust content agendas within their ENGAGE track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the AICPA ENGAGE conference is a broader CPA event – with a number of tracks that have no particular crossover relevance to financial advisors – it is notable that the attendee mix at ENGAGE is \u003cem\u003every \u003c/em\u003ebroad. Which, in practice, makes it somewhat difficult to engage (no pun intended) in networking as an attendee. But for advisors who are simply looking for more advanced and deep technical content – particularly with a tax planning bent – the AICPA\u0026#39;s ENGAGE conference and its PFP (and Advanced Estate and High-Income Tax) tracks are a strong offering, with 3- and 4-day passes available to attend all the content!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Should Attend: Financial advisors with CFP certification (and ideally other advanced degrees and designations) who are looking for more advanced technical and tax planning content to challenge them, particularly with a focus on HNW/ultra-HNW clientele.

In the context of financial advisors, though, the idea of the phone ringing with prospects who call \u003cem\u003eyou \u003c/em\u003eis akin to taking a boat out onto the lake and just waiting for the fish to jump in. If you want to actually catch some fish, you have to cast the rod and try to reel them in, just as financial advisors have to get out there and cold-call, cold-knock, network, or engage in some similar prospecting approach to bring the business in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, at least some advisory firms are increasingly discovering that it really is possible to engage in marketing that builds a brand and draws prospects in, without needing to go out to find them one by one. From Ken Fisher, who is legendary within the industry for building his $275B of AUM almost entirely through direct mail marketing (to \u003ca href=\"https://www.investmentnews.com/industry-news/fisher-investments-sells-stake-for-up-to-3b-but-what-happens-next/254530\"\u003ea recent valuation of nearly $13B of \u003cem\u003eenterprise value\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e), to Josh Brown and the Ritholtz Wealth team, who have grown to more than $5B of AUM \u003ca href=\"https://www.barrons.com/advisor/articles/ritholtz-wealth-management-expansion-73aa5053\"\u003eprimarily through their social media, blogging, and traditional media efforts\u003c/a\u003e, more and more success stories are emerging of advisors who build marketing funnels that attract their ideal prospects \u003cem\u003eto \u003c/em\u003ethem and make the phone ring (or at least make the email inbox alert with a new message).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe added appeal of this approach for many advisory firms as they grow is that it allows the advisory firm to separate \u0026#39;sales\u0026#39; from \u0026#39;service\u0026#39;… alleviating the need to find financial advisors who are good enough at business development to grow the firm (but not \u003cem\u003eso \u003c/em\u003egood that they\u0026#39;d go create their own firm!?), and instead allowing the firm to hire advisors who will focus on simply providing good service to existing clients, and a separate marketing team whose job is to get those clients in the door in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, up until just the past few years, there really were no conferences for financial advisors focused on marketing (actual marketing, as distinct from just engaging in more outbound prospecting/sales strategies).

It is, by design, a substantively more networking-oriented conference. Sessions are relatively short (most are 30 minutes), with futurist-oriented topics (apropos of the name, to help you \u0026#34;Future Proof\u0026#34; your practice) designed to spark conversation more so than bring answers. (And with shortened sessions, there is little-to-no CE at all.) Interspersed throughout the day are interviews with interesting talking heads of the industry (from Jeff Gundlach debating the bond market to Peter Mallouk sharing the evolution of his firm, to yours-truly sharing some of our latest \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/kitces-report-financial-planner-advisor-marketing-tactics-strategies-referrals-centers-influence-networking/\"\u003eKitces Research data\u003c/a\u003e), along with other forms of music and entertainment in what is intended to be much more of a \u0026#39;festival\u0026#39; than a conference in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso unique at FutureProof are their \u003ca href=\"https://futureproof.advisorcircle.com/breakthru/\"\u003e\u0026#34;Breakthru\u0026#34; meetings\u003c/a\u003e, where advisors in advance of the conference can provide an indication of the kinds of other advisors they\u0026#39;d like to meet while they\u0026#39;re there, and have the opportunity to \u0026#39;match\u0026#39; with others who are looking for someone similar, and if both people mutually agree, they are set up to meet at a series of meetup tables for a 15-minute connection (all facilitated by an app designed by the conference organizers to make it easier to match and meet). Because all meetings are by mutual agreement (both parties have to say they\u0026#39;re interested in connecting), the meetings themselves are only 15 minutes (relatively low stakes; if it\u0026#39;s not a good connection, just move on quickly) and the meetings are 1:1 (not overwhelming for the introverts who don\u0026#39;t like big social crowds), advisors who attended have been incredibly upbeat that they were able to make better connections with peers at FutureProof than the \u0026#39;traditional\u0026#39; approach of just talking to people during meals and in the hallways, hoping to meet someone with whom they could connect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to using Breakthru to meet with other advisors, FutureProof also provides the option to use the app for vendor meetups (an alternative to walking the rows of exhibitor booths that also make an appearance at FutureProof). And advisors who \u003cem\u003ewant \u003c/em\u003eto meet with exhibitors, and agree to a set number of meetings, can even get their conference registration fees reduced (or, for leaders at large firms who represent significant buying opportunities for the vendors, waived entirely) in exchange for the facilitated introductions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, though, FutureProof is such an \u0026#39;un-conference\u0026#39; conference for financial advisors that it\u0026#39;s remarkably hard to describe, beyond saying it is a great experience unto itself. Attending is less about the session content (though there are some sessions advisors will probably drift in and out of) and more about the social dynamic of interacting with a wide range of fellow advisors in a comfortable (and lovely outdoors not-conference-room-stuffy) environment, with a conference space (and Breakthru app) that help to facilitate good connections even for those of us who don\u0026#39;t like big social settings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome to FutureProof expecting to have interesting conversations with other advisors, enjoy the feeling of the warm California sun, and leave feeling refreshed after having spent a few days getting fresh air to go with the fresh conversations and fresh ideas.

Which applies to anyone from a piemaker who eventually opens and runs a pie shop, to a financial advisor who starts out giving advice to clients and eventually accrues enough clients (and needs a team to serve them) that they find themselves spending more of their time running the financial advisory business itself.

At some point, advisory firms move away from the \u0026#39;standard\u0026#39; playbook of how to start, run, grow, and scale the business, and into a realm where every business is a function of its unique offering, positioning, team, leadership, and its history of decisions that led it to the point where it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe significance of this shift is that for leaders of growing multi-advisor enterprises, as their business grows to 20, 50, and eventually 100+ team members, learning as a leader is less about just trying to find \u0026#39;the answer\u0026#39; and more about simply trying to broaden their perspective to understand the way it\u0026#39;s been done at other firms, so they can try to figure out what applies, or not, based on their own firm\u0026#39;s unique needs and circumstances.

For which there is no shortage of asset managers who are seeking opportunities of their own to show their new investment ideas to financial advisors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, in addition to its now-popular FutureProof Festival event, the makers of FutureProof have also developed FutureProof Citywide, an event based in Miami (as contrasted with the FutureProof Festival in southern California), that aims to convene all those who touch the investment ecosystem (from advisory firms to asset managers, family offices to PE firms raising capital, and more).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotably, FutureProof Citywide is not intended to be an outdoor experience like FutureProof Festival – instead, it will be \u0026#39;citywide\u0026#39; taking down a series of more than a dozen hotels clustered together around Miami\u0026#39;s South Beach – but is still intended to leverage the same Breakthru Meetings system to facilitate a high level of networking and the opportunity to meet new people (of mutual interest, as Breakthru Meetings still require mutual agreement), in addition to its investment content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDetails\u003c/strong\u003e: March 16-19, 2025, in Miami Beach, FL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCost\u003c/strong\u003e: $1,045, with early bird discounts available. \u003cspan\u003e\u003cem\u003eNerd\u0026#39;s Eye View readers can receive 20% off through this \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://futureproofhq.com/citywide/nerds-eye-view/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eregistration link\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConference Website\u003c/strong\u003e: \u003ca href=\"https://futureproofhq.com/citywide/\"\u003eFutureProof Citywide 2025\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile many financial advisors decide to go to a conference to solve a particular problem – whether it\u0026#39;s an educational gap or a practice management/business need – sometimes the reality is that the reason to attend is little more than spending time with \u0026#39;your people\u0026#39;… the community of advisors that you belong to and wish to (re-)connect with. Which makes the conference less of a conference, per se, and more about \u0026#39;going home\u0026#39; to your community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor most advisors, their \u0026#39;home\u0026#39; conference is the annual conference of their RIA custodian or broker-dealer platform (which is why events like \u003ca href=\"https://impact.schwab.com/\"\u003eSchwab IMPACT\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.lpl.com/about-Us/what-we-do/our-culture/focus.html\"\u003eLPL Focus\u003c/a\u003e are some of the largest conferences in the industry), or the advisor platform they work with (e.g., \u003ca href=\"https://live.xyplanningnetwork.com/\"\u003eXYPN LIVE\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.dynastyfpsummit.com/\"\u003eDynasty Partners Summit\u003c/a\u003e). With the added benefit that not only is it an opportunity to talk to and network (and perhaps to commiserate) with fellow advisors using the same platform, but it\u0026#39;s also an opportunity for the advisors on those respective platforms to see the latest services and capabilities their platforms are rolling out, hear what senior leadership are focused on (or have a chance to ask questions and express concerns), and meet home office staff as well. Not to mention that because advisors with a shared platform tend to have a similar business model and often a similar \u0026#39;profile\u0026#39; (which makes them a fit for that platform), the other advisors in attendance tend to be reasonably similar and good to network with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn turn, the rise of vendor conferences is also creating a new kind of \u0026#39;home\u0026#39; community conference, at least where the technology platform tends to form a major hub around which the advisor\u0026#39;s practice is built. Examples include the \u003ca href=\"https://www.envestnet.com/event/elevate/\"\u003eEnvestnet Advisor Summit\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://orion.com/ascent\"\u003eOrion Ascent\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://nitrogenwealth.com/fearless-summit-2024/\"\u003eNitrogen\u0026#39;s Fearless Investing Summit\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://emoneyadvisor.com/summit/\"\u003eeMoney\u0026#39;s Advisor Conference\u003c/a\u003e. Which again offers opportunities for good networking (advisors using similar systems tend to share other commonalities that give them good chances to share best practices), as well as for hearing the latest and greatest from their vendors and key leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so for advisors who otherwise aren\u0026#39;t certain what conference to attend in 2025, there\u0026#39;s no place like home as the conference of choice. Or alternatively, multi-advisor firms may wish to divide and conquer, with one advisor going to their home conference and another going to something new for 2025!\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what do you plan to attend?
