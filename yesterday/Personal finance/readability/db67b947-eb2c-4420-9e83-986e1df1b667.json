You might think you need cash to get started, but that’s not always true. Over the years, I’ve started many side hustles without spending a penny (including this site that… Are you looking for the best side hustles you can start with no money? Making extra money doesn’t have to cost you anything up front. You might think you need cash to get started, but that’s not always true. Over the years, I’ve started many side hustles without spending a penny (including this site that you’re reading right now), so I personally know that it is possible! And, I know how important it is to make extra money without spending any up front. When I first started side hustling, I focused on free ways to make extra money (because the goal is to make money, not spend more!). Best Side Hustles You Can Start With No Money Below are the best side hustles you can start with no money. 1. Proofreading If you want to make money without spending any, then proofreading could be your answer! It’s a great side hustle that needs just your eyes and brain. Proofreaders check written work for mistakes. They look for spelling errors, wrong punctuation, and bad grammar. You don’t need special tools to start, just a computer and internet. Many people need proofreaders. Writers, businesses, and students all want error-free work, and you can help them while earning money from home. The best part? You can work when you want by setting your own hours and taking on as much or as little work as you like. It’s perfect if you have a busy life or just want extra cash. Recommended reading: 20 Best Online Proofreading Jobs For Beginners (Earn $40,000+ A Year). 10Proofread AnywhereThis free 76-minute workshop answers all of the most common questions about how to become a proofreader, and even talks about the 5 signs that proofreading could be a perfect fit for you. 2. Blogging Blogging is a great way to make money without spending much cash up front. All you need is a computer and internet to get started. You can begin by using a free blogging platform. I actually started my blog for free too! That being said, nowadays I do recommend investing around $30 to buy your domain name and set up self-hosted blogging. Now, I know that $30 is not free, but it’s not too much money either for starting a business. Now, why do I recommend spending this money? A self-hosted blog gives you full control over your website. Free platforms can limit how you make money (like placing ads or working with sponsors), and they can even shut down your site without warning. Plus, having your own domain (like “yourblogname.com”) looks more professional, which helps attract readers and brands. When I switched to self-hosted blogging, it opened up many income opportunities. It was a small investment that quickly paid off. You’ll also have access to better customization options and features, making it easier to grow your blog long-term. If you’re serious about blogging as a side hustle, spending a little up front can help you build a profitable and sustainable business. I even have a step-by-step tutorial to guide you through setting it up – it’s easier than you might think! I have a tutorial you can read here to learn more.

Many websites, magazines, and companies need writers for their content. I have been a freelance writer for years, and I did not spend any money to get started. You can start right away with just your laptop and internet. Freelance writers get to work from home or anywhere they like. They can pick their own hours and choose the topics they want to write about. One nice thing about freelance writing is that you can do it part-time or full-time. You can earn extra cash on the side or turn it into your main job. To get started for free, I recommend that you create some sample articles to show potential clients. Then, start applying for jobs that match your interests and skills. You can learn more at 14 Places To Find Freelance Writing Jobs – (Start With No Experience!). 10How to Get Started in CopywritingThis free training video shows you exactly how to break into copywriting and start earning money from your writing skills, even if you’re brand new and don’t have any experience, certifications, or a portfolio. Learn how to launch your career, land hidden copywriting opportunities, and build a flexible career that works for you. 4. Online tutoring Online tutoring is one of the best side hustle ideas from home that you can do for free. And, there are many topics that you may be able to tutor on, such as math, science, language, or even a hobby like playing the guitar. Pay varies, but many tutors make $20 to $50 an hour. Some experts in tough subjects (like college-level subjects) can earn even more. 5. Virtual assistant I think that becoming a virtual assistant is a great side hustle you can start online with no money. I was a virtual assistant many years ago, and I started completely for free. I reached out to online business owners and applied for many jobs, even though I didn’t have a ton of experience. Thankfully, many business owners will tell you exactly what they want done and will train you! Virtual assistants manage social media, schedule appointments, answer emails, and more. The tasks you do will depend on what you are hired for, as every business may need something a little different. For example, I have one virtual assistant who does a little bit of everything for me – from managing social media to making graphics and replying to emails. But, some virtual assistants may specialize in a certain area such as managing an online store or transcribing audio files. Many virtual assistants earn $20 to $30 per hour when starting out. With experience, you could make even more. Some full-time VAs earn over $10,000 a month! You can find virtual assistant jobs on websites like Fiverr and Upwork. You could also reach out to bloggers or small business owners directly. Recommended reading: Best Ways To Find Virtual Assistant Jobs 6. Social media management When I first started freelancing, I did a lot of social media management. It didn’t cost me any money to get started, instead I learned as I went! Social media management is a great side hustle you can start for free. You just need a computer and internet connection. Many businesses want help with their social media accounts but don’t have time to do it themselves. You can offer to manage Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or other social media platforms for small businesses. This might include making posts, responding to comments, photography, and growing their followers. To get started, learn the basics of each platform. Practice on your own accounts first. Then reach out to local businesses and offer your services. You can start with low rates to build experience. As you improve, you can take on more clients and charge higher rates. Some social media managers make $20 to $50 per hour or more. It’s flexible work you can do from home on your own schedule. 7. Sell items you already own Selling things you already own is one of the easiest ways to make money without spending a penny. You can take a look around your home for items you no longer need – clothes, electronics, books, or even furniture. Platforms like Facebook Marketplace, eBay, Craigslist, or local buy-and-sell groups make it easy to connect with buyers. Not only can this side hustle earn you quick cash, but it also helps declutter your space. Plus, you’re giving new life to items you no longer use, which is great for the environment. I have sold many, many items over the years, and even had a small reselling side business. It’s great because you can start by selling items that you already own, and if you want, you can expand to flipping items for resale. 8. Print on demand Print-on-demand is a great way to make money without spending money up front. You can create custom designs for products like T-shirts, mugs, and phone cases. The best part is that you don’t need to keep any inventory. When someone buys your product, the print-on-demand company makes it and ships it for you. You can earn $500 to $1,500 a month with print-on-demand as a side job. Some people even make it their full-time gig and earn much more. The costs to start are low and sometimes you can even get started for free. Depending on the platform you use, you may pay small fees to list items and for design tools. You can learn more at How To Start a Print On Demand Business. 10Print-On-Demand Free GuideThis freebie will teach you about print-on-demand as well as give you a list of 17 hot-selling products you can sell via print on demand. 9. Affiliate marketing Affiliate marketing is a great side hustle you can start with no money. It’s a way to earn income by promoting other people’s products or services online, like books, clothing, courses, home goods, travel, and more. You don’t need to create your own stuff, which is nice. Instead, you share referral links to things you like and when someone buys through your link, you get a cut of the sale. You can promote your referral links on social media, your blog, or YouTube videos. Joining affiliate programs (such as Amazon) is free, so you can get started and not spend a penny on any upfront costs. I have been an affiliate marketer for years and I absolutely love it. I enjoy how I can share links to products that I already enjoy, help others, and earn money along the way. Recommended reading: What You Need To Know About Affiliate Marketing For Beginners 10. Pet sitting Pet sitting can be a fun way to make extra money. You get to spend time with animals and earn cash too. To start, you don’t need any money up front other than perhaps gas to get to the place where the animal is. You can sell your services to friends, family, and neighbors by letting them know you’re available to watch their pets when they’re away. You can also join dog walking apps like Rover to find more clients. Pet sitters walk dogs, feed cats, or stay overnight at someone’s house. Tasks can include giving pets food and water, playing with them, and cleaning litter boxes. Pet sitting rates vary, but you could make $15 to $25 for a 30-minute dog walk. For overnight stays, you might earn $30 to $50 per day. The more experience and good reviews you have, the more you can charge. 11. Paid online surveys If you want to make money without spending any money, then paid online surveys might be just what you’re looking for. Many companies want to know what you think about their products and services, and they’re willing to pay for your opinions! Now, this won’t make you rich and it won’t be a full-time job, but it can be a way to make money while watching TV on your couch from your phone. Here are some of the top paid online surveys that I recommend: Swagbucks Survey Junkie Branded Surveys American Consumer Opinion User Interviews Rakuten Insight Prime Opinion KashKick Most surveys pay between 50 cents and $5 each. Sometimes, you might even find surveys that pay $10 or more! While you won’t get rich, it’s an easy way to make some pocket money in your spare time. Many survey sites also have other ways to make extra money too. You can get paid to watch videos, play games, or shop online. Recommended reading: 21 Best Free Surveys That Pay Cash Instantly 12. Play games on your phone Do you like playing games on your phone? You might be able to make some extra money while having fun! There are apps that let you earn real cash just by playing games. Here’s a quick list of my favorite game apps that pay real cash: Freecash KashKick Swagbucks InboxDollars I’ve been able to make real money just by playing games on my phone during my downtime. In fact, I’ve made $302 in a single week from one game that I put toward free Amazon gift cards! You can read about my experience at How I Made $302.80 Playing Games on My Phone (In One Week). When you’re ready to get paid, most apps let you cash out through PayPal or gift cards. It’s an easy way to make a little extra cash in your spare time. Just be sure to read the rules for each app. Some might have age limits or only work in certain countries. And always be careful about spending real money in these games. I didn’t have to spend any money in order to make the $302 that I mentioned above. Recommended reading: 23 Best Game Apps To Win Real Money 10FreecashFreecash is a site where you can make extra money by testing apps, playing games, and answering surveys. It’s easy to use, and you can cash out your rewards for PayPal cash or gift cards. Personally, I’ve earned over $720 in Amazon gift cards using Freecash, and I think it’s a great way to make extra money during your free time. 13. Delivery driver Being a delivery driver is a great side hustle you can start with no money. You can use your own car to deliver food, groceries, or packages. Popular apps like DoorDash and Uber Eats let you deliver food from restaurants to hungry customers. You pick up the orders and bring them right to people’s homes. Instacart is another option where you shop for and deliver groceries. This can be a fun way to earn money while helping busy people get their weekly shopping done. If you prefer package delivery, check out Amazon Flex, and this is where you can deliver Amazon orders using your own car. 14. YouTube channel Starting a YouTube channel can be a fun way to make money without spending any. All you need is a phone or computer with a camera. You can make videos about things you like or know a lot about, such as cooking, video games, or even telling jokes. You don’t need fancy equipment – just use what you have, especially when you’re just getting started. Your channel could become a great side job. Some people even turn it into their main job. But don’t worry about that now – just have fun making videos! Recommended reading: How Much Do YouTubers Make? Frequently Asked Questions Starting a side hustle without money is doable.

You can also start small to practice or even offer your services to friends or family first.
