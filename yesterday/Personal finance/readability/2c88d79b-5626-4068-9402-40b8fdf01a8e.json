One moment you’re buying newborn onesies, and the next, your toddler is running around the house. The reality is that babies grow fast, and the items they need during those early years… Are you looking for the best places to sell used baby items? As parents, we all know how quickly baby items pile up. One moment you’re buying newborn onesies, and the next, your toddler is running around the house. The reality is that babies grow fast, and the items they need during those early years – like clothes, toys, and gear – quickly become unnecessary. Instead of letting those items collect dust, why not turn them into extra money? Selling used baby items can help you declutter your home, put money back in your pocket, and even contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle by giving those items a second life. You can sell baby items like clothing, bouncers, baby carriers, crib mattresses, toys, and anything else related to babies that you may have. With my own 3-year-old daughter, Marlowe, I’ve experienced firsthand how quickly baby gear adds up. From outgrown onesies to a stroller we barely used, I realized that many of these items still had value. In this article, I’ll share where to sell baby items, along with tips to help you get the most money for your gear. Best Places To Sell Used Baby Items Wondering where to sell used baby stuff that you no longer need? Here are the 11 best places to sell used baby items to make extra money. 1. Once Upon A Child Once Upon A Child is a well-known chain specializing in buying and selling gently used children’s items. They accept everything from children’s clothing and shoes to toys and baby gear. You can bring in your items, and they’ll give you cash on the spot (or store credit) for what they decide to buy. It’s quick and easy, but keep in mind that they’re selective and may not accept everything. Also, Once Upon A Child buys and sells maternity clothing, so you can sell this as well! Pros: Immediate payout, no shipping required.Cons: Payout is typically lower than what you could make selling directly to buyers. 2. Facebook groups Local Facebook groups, especially parenting or baby gear swap groups, are a great place for connecting with other parents in your area. I’m in a local mom group for my area, and there are always tons of used baby gear and clothes listed for sale – onesies, snowsuits, shoes, toys, strollers, and more. Pros: No fees, highly targeted audience.Cons: Requires coordination with buyers for pickup. 3. Facebook Marketplace Facebook Marketplace is another great option for selling baby items locally. It’s easy to create listings, and the platform reaches a wide audience in your area. You can also offer shipping to expand your buyer pool. Pros: Large audience, no listing fees for most items.Cons: You may need to negotiate with buyers. 4. Craigslist Craigslist has been around for years and remains a popular option for selling items locally. It’s particularly useful for larger items like cribs, strollers, and high chairs. I have sold many items on Craigslist over the years, and I often see baby clothing for sale here. If you have a lot of baby gear or clothing that you want to sell all at once, I have many times seen parents list bags of clothing for sale as a bundle on Craigslist. Pros: Free to list, good for bulky items.Cons: Less user-friendly compared to newer platforms. Targeted to your specific town or area, and can be hard for people outside your area to see your listing. 5. eBay EBay is great for selling higher-end baby gear, unique items, or bundles of baby clothing. You can list your items as an auction or set a fixed price. This site is also good for items that appeal to a niche audience, like specialty brands or limited-edition items. Pros: Large audience, potential for higher payouts.Cons: Fees for listings and final sales, requires shipping. 6. Mercari Mercari is a popular app for selling a variety of items, including baby gear. It’s easy to use and allows you to set your prices, making it great for smaller items like baby clothes, toys, and accessories. Pros: Easy-to-use app, shipping options available.Cons: Fees for each sale. 7. OfferUp OfferUp is similar to Craigslist but with a more modern and user-friendly app. You can sell items locally or ship them to buyers in other areas. It’s a good platform for larger baby items like swings and bassinets. Pros: Local and shipping options, easy communication with buyers.Cons: Fees for shipped items. 8. Poshmark While Poshmark is known for fashion, it’s also a great platform for selling baby clothes and accessories. The app is straightforward, and buyers are usually willing to pay more for name-brand items. Pros: Higher payouts for premium items, easy-to-use app.Cons: Fee on sales. 9. GoodBuy Gear GoodBuy Gear is an online children’s consignment store. They take care of the selling process for you, including cleaning and photographing the items, which makes it very convenient. You can sell items like strollers, wagons, car seats, bouncers, swings, breast pumps, baby monitors, and more. But, they do not accept children’s clothing or shoes, books, large furniture, bottles, or any items under $25. Pros: Hassle-free selling, high-quality presentation.Cons: Fees may reduce your overall profit. 10. ThredUp ThredUp is a consignment platform that allows you to sell baby and kids’ clothes. Simply send in your items using their Clean Out Kit, and they’ll handle the rest. Pros: Minimal effort required, good for bulk selling.Cons: Lower payouts compared to direct selling. 11. Garage sales If you’re looking to sell multiple items at once, a garage sale is a classic option. It’s perfect for clearing out baby gear quickly and connecting with local buyers. Pros: Quick sales, no shipping required.Cons: Requires time and effort to set up. Usually, items sell for a very low price. My Tips for Selling Used Baby Items To make more money and make the selling process easy, here are some of my top tips: Organize your items – Sort through your baby items and group them by type – clothes, toys, gear, etc. This makes it easier to create listings or organize for a garage sale. Highlight quality brands – If you have items from popular or high-end baby brands, make sure to mention that in your listings. These brands often fetch higher prices. Be honest about wear and tear – Transparency is key when selling used items. Clearly describe any flaws or signs of wear to avoid disputes with buyers. If there’s a stain you can clean up, I recommend trying to do so (items in good condition will typically go for more money, of course, over an item in bad condition). Think about seasonal timing – Certain items, like winter coats or outdoor play gear, may sell better during specific months. I have sold many items over the years, and I always try to clean them up as best as I can so that I can make the most money, as well as increase how fast something sells. An item in good condition will typically sell faster! Frequently Asked Questions About Where To Sell Used Baby Items Below are answers to common questions about where to sell used baby items to make money. Where is the best place to sell baby items? The best place to sell used baby items depends on what you’re selling. For clothes, apps like Poshmark or ThredUp work well. For larger gear, local options like Facebook Marketplace or Once Upon A Child may be better. How much should you sell used baby items for? Typically, you can sell gently used baby items for 30% to 50% of the original retail price. Premium brands or like-new items can go for more. And some onesies from some of the popular bamboo clothing stores can even fetch you 100% of the price you paid for it (there are even Facebook groups dedicated to bamboo baby clothing!). Does Once Upon A Child pay well? Once Upon A Child is very convenient but usually pays less than what you’d make selling directly. Their payouts are around 30% to 40% of what they’ll sell the item for. So, if they sell a used stroller for $50 in their store, then you may get around $15 for it. What are the best places to sell used baby items online? EBay, Mercari, and GoodBuy Gear are great for selling used baby items online, depending on the type of items you’re selling. Where can you sell baby clothes for cash nearby? If you want to sell baby clothes for cash nearby, you may want to try local options like Once Upon A Child, hosting a garage sale, or Facebook Marketplace. Is it worth it to sell used baby items? Yes! Selling used baby items can help you earn extra money, declutter your home, and give items a second life. The time investment is minimal compared to the financial and environmental benefits. Where To Sell Used Baby Items – Summary I hope you enjoyed my article on where to sell used baby items. Selling used baby items is a win-win. You get to declutter your home, make some extra money, and help other families find affordable baby gear. Whether you prefer local options like Once Upon A Child or online platforms like Mercari and eBay, there are plenty of ways to turn those outgrown baby items into cash. You can start small by listing or selling a few items on your preferred platform and see how easy it can be. Who knows – you might just find a new side hustle in the process! What do you usually do with your old baby items? Do you sell them? Donate them? Trash?

Clearly describe any flaws or signs of wear to avoid disputes with buyers. If there’s a stain you can clean up, I recommend trying to do so (items in good condition will typically go for more money, of course, over an item in bad condition).\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThink about seasonal timing\u003c/strong\u003e – Certain items, like winter coats or outdoor play gear, may sell better during specific months.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have sold many items over the years, and I always try to clean them up as best as I can so that I can make the most money, as well as increase how fast something sells.

For clothes, apps like Poshmark or ThredUp work well. For larger gear, local options like Facebook Marketplace or Once Upon A Child may be better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much should you sell used baby items for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTypically, you can sell gently used baby items for 30% to 50% of the original retail price. Premium brands or like-new items can go for more. And some onesies from some of the popular bamboo clothing stores can even fetch you 100% of the price you paid for it (there are even Facebook groups dedicated to bamboo baby clothing!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDoes Once Upon A Child pay well?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce Upon A Child is very convenient but usually pays less than what you’d make selling directly. Their payouts are around 30% to 40% of what they’ll sell the item for. So, if they sell a used stroller for $50 in their store, then you may get around $15 for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the best places to sell used baby items online?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEBay, Mercari, and GoodBuy Gear are great for selling used baby items online, depending on the type of items you’re selling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere can you sell baby clothes for cash nearby?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to sell baby clothes for cash nearby, you may want to try local options like Once Upon A Child, hosting a garage sale, or Facebook Marketplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs it worth it to sell used baby items?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes!
