My last two weeks have been like that.I had major family obligations to deal with, I started helping more at my dad’s business, and I took on another small freelance job — all within the same week. Life got crazy.Needless to say, I let overwhelm take over, and my money pretty much flew out the window.When it comes to budgeting, falling off track is a common problem. Here’s how I’ve recovered from my overspend, and how you can do the same:1. Stop DwellingI ate out almost every night for the past two weeks. The house remained a wreck, and I stacked my unopened bills on the corner of the kitchen table.Going over budget sucks, but it’s not the end of the world. Life happens: you can’t be perfect all the time.Acknowledge that you messed up, then move on. Obsessing about it isn’t going to bring your money back.2. Get Back in Your Old RoutineAfter recovering from a couple weeks of burnout, I started getting my financials back in order by returning to my old routines. I also played a little bit of catch up: paid my bills, balanced my checkbook, and took care of some transfers.Sometimes when you fall off track, it makes you want to stay off track. It takes more effort to jump back on the bandwagon than it does to remain on the same path. That’s why it’s important to get back into your old routine as soon as you have the chance.Get everything caught up, map out a plan for the remainder of the month, and immediately return to your former routine.3. Temporarily Cut ExpensesThese past few weeks, I’ve earned a little extra money. My overspending, therefore, didn’t get in the way of paying my bills — it just prevented me from saving the extra money like I’d planned.I still desperately wanted to add a little extra to my savings this month, so I decided to temporarily cut back on my expenses.If you need to cut back, consider the following tactics:Eat at home until you’ve cleaned your shelves outHave “no-spend” days, when you don’t spend a single pennySkip paid entertainment and opt for board game nights or free concertsIf you’re still facing a budget discrepancy, you may have to look for extra ways to earn money for the month. Consider selling something or picking up extra hours at work.The point is: if you’ve blown your budget, don’t beat yourself up too badly. We all make mistakes. The important thing is to pick up where you left off and get back to your budget assoon as possible.When’s the last time you blew your budget?Tagged as: Budgeting, Frugality, Money TipsEditor's Note: Did you know about the service called $5 meal plans?
