Websites like Swagbucks can give you many chances to make money from home. You can answer surveys, watch videos, play game apps to win real money, and more to earn extra money. If you’re looking to make more money, trying out different reward sites can be an easy move. Each one has its own set of tasks and ways to earn. Some might pay better for certain activities, while others could have easier goals to reach. I have earned over 100 free gift cards and PayPal money by using many of the sites below, so I know they are real! What Is Swagbucks? Swagbucks is a free website that pays you to do easy online tasks. You can earn points called SB for things like: Taking surveys Watching videos Playing games Shopping online Searching the web Scanning receipts It’s simple to use and you can do it anywhere with internet access. When you earn enough SB points, you can trade them for gift cards or PayPal cash. Swagbucks started in 2008 (you can find my full Swagbucks review here). Since then, they’ve given out over $606 million to members. Every day, about 7,000 people get free gift cards. You won’t get rich using Swagbucks. But it’s an easy way to earn some extra spending money or save up for small treats. Many people use it during free time, like when watching TV. I have been using this site since around 2011 and I have earned over 100 free gift cards. I like to use my points for free Amazon gift cards! If you join Swagbucks through my referral link, you will receive a $10 bonus. I have redeemed 109 gift cards so far from Swagbucks, as you can see in the image above. Best Websites Like Swagbucks Here’s a quick list of the best sites like Swagbucks: Freecash KashKick InboxDollars Fetch Rewards Survey Junkie Pinecone Research PrizeRebel MyPoints Branded Surveys American Consumer Opinion Ipsos iSay Rakuten Below are the best websites like Swagbucks to make money. Proof that I made money playing games on Freecash. The $0.05 amounts were rewards for playing 2 minutes each day. The larger amounts like $40, $70, and $150 were for reaching certain levels. 1. Freecash Freecash is a website that lets you earn money by doing fun activities online. You can make extra cash by playing games, trying new apps, and answering surveys. It’s really easy to use and you can start earning right away. When you sign up for Freecash, you’ll see lots of different ways to make money. You can pick the ones that sound most interesting to you. For example, you might get paid to play a new game on your phone or share your thoughts in a survey. Some people are able to earn a decent amount on Freecash as well. They have a leaderboard where you can see exactly how much others have earned. According to this leaderboard, one person had made $5,698.71 in the last 25 days! Many others have made over $1,000 in the same time frame as well. I have personally made a little over $300 by playing games on my phone on Freecash in only one week. You can read about it here – How I Made $302.80 Playing Games on My Phone (In One Week). Click here to sign up for Freecash. Recommended reading: Freecash Review – Is Freecash Legit? 2. KashKick KashKick is a rewards site where you can earn money by doing fun activities online. You can take surveys, play games, and try out new apps to make extra cash.

InboxDollars is owned by the same company as Swagbucks, so it’s trustworthy and reliable. Sign up for InboxDollars here and get a free $5 bonus. 4. Fetch Rewards Fetch Rewards is a free app that gives you points for scanning your receipts. You can use it at any store or restaurant. I scan every single one of my grocery receipts and earn free points, for example. Here’s how it works: You shop like normal, then take a picture of your receipt with your phone. The app gives you points for each receipt you scan. You can earn more points by buying certain items and the app shows you which products will get you extra points. Once you have enough points, you can trade them for gift cards. You can get cards for places like Amazon, Target, and Starbucks. Fetch Rewards is easy to use. You don’t need to clip coupons or do surveys. Just scan your receipts and watch your points grow. I love this app because it’s really easy to use. I’ve been using it for a while, and it makes earning rewards from your regular shopping simple. I just used my points to get a $50 Amazon gift card the other day! You can sign up for Fetch Rewards here.  Recommended reading: Fetch Rewards Review (Is This App Legit?) 5. Survey Junkie Survey Junkie is a popular site that pays you for sharing your opinions. It focuses on surveys, so it doesn’t have games or other ways to earn points – but it has a lot of available surveys for you to answer. You can sign up for free and start earning points right away. The surveys are about different topics, and you pick the ones you want to do. Each survey tells you how long it will take and how many points you’ll get, so this helps you choose the best ones for your time. When you have enough points, you can trade them for money. You can get paid through PayPal or with gift cards. You can sign up for Survey Junkie here. 6. Pinecone Research Pinecone Research is a popular survey site that lets you make money sharing your opinions. It’s similar to Swagbucks but focuses mainly on surveys. You can earn points for each survey you complete and these points can be traded for cash or prizes. Pinecone Research is known for paying well, as well as giving free items occasionally to test. Most surveys pay around $3 each. To join, you need an invite so this makes it more exclusive than some other survey sites. Like Swagbucks, Pinecone Research is free to join. You don’t need to pay anything to start earning money from surveys. I have been using Pinecone Research for years and personally earned money from this company. In the past, I have been able to test a few different household products through Pinecone Research, such as toilet paper. It is very popular! You can sign up for Pinecone Research here.

Here’s a screenshot from my Rakuten account showing how much cash back I have recently earned. (I edited out some personal info, such as the order numbers). 12. Rakuten Rakuten is a great way to earn cash back on your online shopping. It’s kind of similar to Swagbucks but is all about earning cash back on your online shopping. You can get cash back at over 3,500 stores when you shop through Rakuten. This includes big names like Amazon, Walmart, and Target. To use Rakuten, just click through their site or app before you shop online. They’ll track your purchase and add cash back to your account. Rakuten pays out every three months by check or PayPal. You need at least $5 in your account to get paid. Rakuten also has a browser extension (I highly recommend downloading this so that you don’t forget to get cash back!). It reminds you to activate cash back when you’re on a partner site. While it doesn’t offer as many earning options as Swagbucks, Rakuten is great if you shop online a lot. It’s an easy way to save money on things you’re already buying. I recently made a big purchase online and I was able to get around $90 back from Rakuten. It was very easy and free money! Please click here to sign up for Rakuten. Plus, you can get a $30 bonus when you spend $30 if you join right now (at the time of this writing; please double-check the current offer).

What are the best sites like Swagbucks to make money? Some top sites like Swagbucks are Freecash, KashKick, and InboxDollars. These sites let you earn money by taking surveys, watching videos, and shopping online. Fetch Rewards and Survey Junkie are also good options. They offer rewards for everyday activities like scanning receipts or sharing your opinions in online surveys. Can you make $50 a day with Swagbucks? Making $50 a day on Swagbucks is tough. It would take a lot of time and effort. Most people earn a few dollars a day at most. To increase your earnings, you can try doing high-paying surveys and offers and using the site when you shop online to get cash back too. Is it possible to make $100 a day from Swagbucks? Earning $100 daily on Swagbucks is not realistic for most people. The site isn’t meant to replace a full-time job. A more reasonable goal is $5 to $10 per day if you put in several hours of work. How to get 10,000 Swagbucks fast? Getting 10,000 SB quickly takes some work. Try these tips: Complete the highest-paying surveys Sign up for free trials through Swagbucks Use Swagbucks when you shop online Watch videos in your spare time Invite friends to join (you’ll get bonuses) Is Survey Junkie better than Swagbucks?
