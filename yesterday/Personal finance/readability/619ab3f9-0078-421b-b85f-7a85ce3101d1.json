There are many fun and safe jobs for 10-year-olds, and these jobs can teach important lessons about responsibility and managing money. When I was young, I remember how excited I was after making my first few dollars from small jobs like babysitting. It taught me so much about responsibility and the value of a hard-earned dollar – lessons that stick with you for life! Recommended reading: 23 Best Business Ideas For Kids To Make Extra Money Can 10 year olds work legally? Kids can work legally, but there are rules to follow. The laws protect young workers and make sure they stay safe, which is really important! In the U.S., kids under 14 can’t work most regular jobs, but there are some exceptions. A kid may be able to do things like babysitting, delivering newspapers, or dog walking. If they’re 14 or 15, they can work more jobs but with limits. They can usually only work certain hours and not during school time (school is very important, after all). It’s important to stay safe when wanting to make money. Always: Make sure parents/guardians are aware of what the child is doing. Work with people you know. Have an adult you trust nearby. Make sure that your child checks in with you before taking on any new jobs. And, I think another important thing is to make sure that the child knows that they can ask the guardian/parent for help at any time, without feeling dumb or scared. You want them to be open with you about what’s going on. The government sets rules about how long kids can work. For example, during school weeks, kids may not be able to work more than 3 hours on a school day. On weekends and holidays, kids may be able to work up to 8 hours. These rules help keep children safe and make sure they have time for school and fun. You’ll want to research the child labor laws in your area as they can vary. Here’s a good place to start – U.S. Department of Labor – Child Labor. Best Jobs for 10 Year Olds Below are the best jobs for 10-year-olds. 1. Pet sitting Pet sitting can be a fun way for 10-year-olds to make money. Pet sitters take care of dogs, cats, or other pets while their owners are away, so this job is great if your child loves animals. Pet sitters feed pets, give them water, and play with them. They might also clean litter boxes for cats. Typically, the owner will give instructions on what to do, such as when to feed the animals or when to go on a walk. A 10-year-old can start by offering to watch neighbors’ pets and telling parents’ friends when they’re available to pet sit. They can even make flyers to put up in your neighborhood. 2. Babysitting Babysitting is a good job for 10-year-olds who like kids and are mature enough to handle the responsibility. They can start by watching younger siblings or cousins. A 10-year-old can start with short babysitting jobs, like watching a child for an hour or two. They might help kids with homework, play games, or read stories. Safety is super important, so they should know how to call 911 and have emergency contacts handy. It’s also good to learn basic first aid. I started babysitting at a young age, first with my younger sister and eventually by being paid by families in my neighborhood. It was a job that I liked and it paid well! 3. Dog walking Dog walking can be a fun way for 10-year-olds to earn money. Kids can get paid to walk dogs in your neighborhood after school or on weekends. A 10-year-old can start this side job by asking parents if they know anyone who needs help with their pets. They could also make flyers to put up around your area. When walking dogs, it’s always important to make sure to follow safety rules. For example, always use a leash and pick up after the dog. A child might be able to charge $5 to $10 per walk (or more), depending on how long it takes. Some people may want their dog walked every day, while others might need help once a week. I recently saw a flyer on a local bulletin board where a kid was advertising their dog walking services. They were charging around $5 for a 30-minute walk, and the parent would be with them to help. It was simply a way for the child to get out and learn how to make money, and I thought it was a really sweet idea! 4. Yard work Yard work is a great way for 10-year-olds to earn money, and this is where they help your neighbors keep their lawns looking nice and cut. Here are some ideas: Mowing lawns is a popular choice. Your child can push a lawn mower to cut grass and make yards look nice. Raking leaves is perfect for fall. Your child can gather leaves into piles and bag them up. Pulling weeds is an easy job that makes a big difference. Your child can remove unwanted plants from gardens and flower beds. Yard work can be tough but people will usually happily pay for the job to be done. I remember helping out with yard chores for neighbors as a kid, and it felt great knowing my hard work was appreciated – and it taught me a lot about sticking with a job until it’s done. 5. Car washing Car washing is a fun job for 10-year-olds and your child can sell this service to family, friends, and neighbors. They’ll need some basic supplies like soap, sponges, and towels. They might also want a bucket and hose if available. Safety is important when washing cars, so make sure an adult is nearby to help. They can guide your child and keep them safe around vehicles. 6. Tutoring If your child is good at a school subject (like math, reading, or spelling), then they might be able to tutor younger kids. Many parents want help for their kids who are struggling in school. Your child could work with children who are a few years younger. Helping someone understand a tricky subject can be so satisfying. When I was young, I loved tutoring my younger sibling in reading and math, and seeing them improve was its own reward. Plus, it taught me patience and helped me build confidence in my own skills. 7. Paper delivery Paper delivery is a classic job for kids. They can start as young as 10 years old in some areas. It’s a great way to earn money and learn responsibility. As a paper deliverer, they’ll wake up early to bring newspapers to people’s homes. Your child might use a bike or walk to get around your neighborhood. Some newspapers only hire teens, but others welcome younger kids. Ask your local paper if they have routes for 10-year-olds. When I was younger, I had a friend whose family had a paper delivery route as a side hustle. She would help her family out and earn a little extra money as well. No, she didn’t do this entirely on her own, but it was sort of a family side hustle where they all worked together. 8. Helping at a family business Many kids get their first work experience by helping out with the family business. This can be a great way for kids to learn new skills and earn some money. A 10-year-old might help stock shelves at their parents’ store. Or maybe they could answer phones at their office. Some kids help with filing papers or organizing inventory. If your family runs a restaurant, they could help set tables or greet customers. On a family farm, they might feed animals or help with simple chores. 9. Lemonade stand A lemonade stand is a fun way for 10-year-olds to make money. A 10-year-old can set up a stand in their neighborhood or at local events (be sure an adult is nearby to help!). Kids can make a bold sign with a catchy slogan, like “Ice Cold Lemonade!” to grab attention. Pricing can be simple – charging $1 per cup keeps things affordable and easy to manage. Running a lemonade stand is a classic, and it’s such a fun way to learn the basics of business! I remember setting one up with friends when I was young – figuring out how much to charge, making signs, and talking to customers. It was such a great feeling to earn money from something we created ourselves. 10. Selling handmade crafts Selling handmade crafts is a fun way for 10-year-olds to make money. They can make jewelry, art, or other crafts to sell at local markets or online (such as on Etsy). Popular crafts for kids include friendship bracelets, painted rocks, bookmarks, and slime. They might also try making keychains, bookmarks, or small paintings. And, yes, people will buy kids’ products! I recently bought some beautiful earrings from a young girl. I watched her make them and then bought a few sets for myself. She priced her bead earrings for around $10 a set, and I thought it was a great craft business idea. 11. Snow removal Snow removal is a great job for 10-year-olds who don’t mind cold weather. They can help neighbors clear their driveways and sidewalks after a snowfall. They can charge by the hour or set a flat rate for each driveway. Rates often range from $10 to $25 per hour. Some people might pay more for larger areas or heavy snowfall. Remember that they should take breaks and stay safe while working. Lifting heavy snow can be tiring, so help them not to overdo it. An adult should help the child find customers in their neighborhood and not go knocking door to door alone. 12. Grocery shopping assistant Helping with grocery shopping can be a fun job for 10-year-olds, and they can help neighbors or family friends who need a hand at the store. The child’s tasks might include pushing the cart, reading the shopping list, and finding items on shelves. They can also help compare prices to find the best deals. This job teaches the child about budgeting and nutrition. They’ll learn to pick fresh produce and read food labels. It’s a great way to practice math skills too. 13. Pick up after dogs A 10-year-old may be able to make some money by cleaning up dog poop in your neighbors’ yards. This job is perfect for 10-year-olds who don’t mind getting a little dirty. When I was a kid, I remember my dad actually telling me that this was one of his first jobs when he was a kid! He would clean up dog poop in local backyards near his home. A 10-year-old will need some basic supplies like plastic bags, gloves, and a small shovel or scooper. The child can start by talking to neighbors who have dogs and offer to clean their yards once or twice a week. They can charge a small fee for each visit. 14. Mother’s helper Being a mother’s helper is a great job for 10-year-olds. They can help parents with small tasks around the house while they’re home. This gives them a chance to help out and earn some money. As a mother’s helper, a 10-year-old might play with younger kids or keep them busy. They could also help with light household chores like tidying up toys, setting the table for dinner, putting clothes in the dryer, cleaning up small messes, watering plants, or loading the dishwasher. When I was young, I helped my neighbors by playing with their younger kids and cleaning up small messes, and it made me feel grown-up and trusted. It’s a job that teaches how important it is to lend a helping hand. Frequently Asked Questions Many 10-year-olds want to earn money. Here are some common questions about jobs for 10-year-olds. How can a 10 year old make money? A 10-year-old can make money by helping neighbors and family. Pet sitting is a great option if they like animals. They could also do yard work like lawn mowing, raking leaves, or watering plants. Car washing is another fun way to earn cash. What are some good ways for a 10 year old to earn money during the summer? Summer is a great time for kids to make money as kids typically have more free time since they are off from school. They could set up a lemonade stand on hot days or an indoor bake sale. Helping with garden work is another good choice. Some families need help watching younger kids during summer break, so babysitting might work too. Can a 10 year old legally get a job and start working? Most regular jobs have age minimums, and at age 10, they can’t work for a business. But they can do small jobs for people you know, like family members. This includes things like dog walking or helping with chores. A child should always check with their parents first. What type of jobs can kids do at home to make some extra cash? A kid can find ways to earn money without leaving home. Helping with chores like folding laundry or washing dishes might earn them an allowance. If the kid is crafty, they could make and sell items online with adult help. Some kids even start small businesses from home. Are there any online jobs suitable for a 10 year old? Online jobs for 10-year-olds are limited. Children need to be careful online and have their parents’ okay. Some kids make YouTube channel videos or start blogs with family help.
