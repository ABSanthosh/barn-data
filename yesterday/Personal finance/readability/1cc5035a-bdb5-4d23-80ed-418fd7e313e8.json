  "text": "Image courtesy of U.S. BankU.S. Bank’s credit card portfolio has a new addition, and it's a doozy for anyone seeking a lengthy break from interest charges.The $0-annual-fee U.S. Bank Shield Visa offers what's now a market-leading 0% intro APR period on purchases and balance transfers for the first 24 billing cycles after card opening. (After that, a variable APR will apply, currently 17.74% to 28.74%). As of March 2025, that's the longest promotional interest-free period you're likely to find among major credit card issuers, outshining introductory APR offers from competitors like the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card. U.S. Bank's other primary 0% intro APR card — the U.S. Bank Visa® Platinum Card — is no longer available to new applicants, according to a U.S. Bank spokesperson. To qualify for the 0% interest rate on balance transfers, Shield cardholders must initiate the transfer within 60 days of account opening. A 5% balance transfer fee applies, which is on the high end for such fees. While the Shield card’s two-year interest-free period is the showstopper, it has some other notable features that aren’t typical of cards in its class. It offers:4% cash back on prepaid air, hotel and car reservations booked in the U.S. Bank Travel Rewards Center.A $20 annual statement credit after making purchases with the card for 11 consecutive months.Cell phone insurance up to $600 of coverage if you pay your cell phone bill with the Shield card. Car rental insurance when you pay for the rental with the Shield card.The Shield card is the latest expansion of U.S. Bank's credit card portfolio and follows closely on the heels of the launch of the U.S. Bank Smartly™ Visa Signature® Card, in late 2024.",
