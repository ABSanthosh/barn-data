I turned my points in all for free Amazon gift cards! 1. Freecash Freecash is a fun way to make money by playing games on your phone, and I think it’s one of the best game apps to win Amazon gift cards.

In Blackout Bingo, you can bet money on each game, so this does mean that there are ways to spend money on in-app purchases. I do recommend being careful so that you don’t spend money that you can’t afford. The bets can be as low as $0.60 or as high as $260. If you win, you could get a cash prize. Remember, while it’s possible to win money, there’s no guarantee. Only play with money you can afford to lose. Please, please, please always game responsibly. 13. Bubble Cash Bubble Cash is a fun game that lets you earn Amazon gift cards while popping colorful bubbles. You can play this game on your phone or tablet whenever you have free time.

You can cash out your winnings for Amazon gift cards once you reach the minimum amount. The more you play and win, the more gift cards you can earn. Remember to set a budget (because this is a game where you have to pay to play at times) and play responsibly. Bubble Cash can be a fun way to earn some extra Amazon gift cards, but it won’t replace your regular income. 14. MyPoints MyPoints is a site where you can earn gift cards by playing games online.
