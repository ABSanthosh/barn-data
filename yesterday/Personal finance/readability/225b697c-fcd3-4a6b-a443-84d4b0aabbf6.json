  "text": "One of the biggest reasons I was against contributing to a Roth IRA is my belief that most people won’t make more money in retirement than while working. As a result, they’re unlikely to pay a higher tax rate in retirement than during their working years. This belief also assumes that tax rates will stay stable. Since 2009, when I first shared my views on Financial Samurai, tax rates have generally trended lower. Just as cutting Social Security benefits is political self-harm, campaigning to raise taxes isn’t a winning strategy for politicians seeking power. Earning more money in retirement than during your working years requires effort, discipline, consistency, and a bit of good luck. Considering the current state of personal finances in America—which isn't great—this scenario is unlikely for most people. Intuitively, many people understand this. However, let’s dive into the numbers to get a clearer picture. I’ll also explore why some of us might very well end up making more in retirement than we did while working. One key is understanding the concept of deferred income and how it is taxed. Why Most People Will Earn Less in Retirement If we look at the median and average net worth for retirees, it’s logical to conclude that most Americans will earn more while working than when retired. The median household income in the U.S. is about $80,000. The median individual income is about $43,000. Now, consider the median net worth of $192,000 (based on the latest Consumer Finance Survey). Using the 4% rule, a safe withdrawal rate, this net worth generates only $7,680 annually. Fortunately, Social Security provides an average payout of $22,333 per year, and rises with an inflation index each year. Adding these together gives retirees a total income of $30,013 annually. Compare this to the median individual income of $43,000. $30,013 is about 30% less. The median net worth would need to be at least $325,000 higher, or over $517,000, for the typical retiree to make more in retirement. On the bright side, retirees earning $30,013 annually don’t need to worry much about taxes due to the standard deduction and lower marginal tax rates at this income level. I estimate that individuals can amass up to a $1.5 million portfolio and still not have to pay much if any taxes in retirement. WhyYou Might Earn More in Retirement Than While Working While most Americans earn less in retirement, you aren’t most people. You subscribe to the free Financial Samurai newsletter and are obsessed about money and living an incredible life! Readers of personal finance sites like this one are likely saving far more and investing more strategically than the average individual. We're a nerdy bunch who care immensely about our financial future. Thanks to the power of compounding, decades of disciplined saving and investing could result in you earning far more in retirement than you ever anticipated. The personal saving rate in America is only 4.4% The Power of Compounding Let’s illustrate compounding’s incredible potential. Suppose you invest $100,000 and earn an annual return of 10%. The example assumes no additional contributions after the initial $100,000 investment. Here’s how your wealth grows over time: Year 1: $100,000 → $110,000 Year 10: $100,000 → ~$259,000 Year 20: $100,000 → ~$672,000 Year 30: $100,000 → ~$1.74 million Year 40: $100,000 → ~$4.52 million Year 50: $100,000 → ~$11.74 million It might take 30 years to reach your first million, but by Year 50, compounding adds millions annually to your portfolio. Starting early and staying invested are key to building significant wealth. Why 401(k) And IRA Withdrawals Are Considered Income Another reason you could earn more in retirement is the tax treatment of withdrawals. This point didn’t fully hit me until I spoke with Bill Bengen, creator of the 4% Rule, and after I wrote another post on minimizing taxes when withdrawing from retirement portfolios. Withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are classified as ordinary income, not capital gains. Why? Contributions were pre-tax: You didn’t pay income tax on contributions, so taxes are deferred until withdrawal. Growth was tax-deferred: The IRS lets investments grow tax-free in these accounts, but it recaptures taxes later by treating withdrawals as income. Once you think about 401(k) and IRA withdrawals as deferred income, it should now make sense as to why the withdrawals aren't taxed as capital gains. Heck, think about your entire 401(k) and IRA balance as a big pot of tax deferred income the IRS is just waiting to get their hands on if you will. All this time, you may have assumed that your investments in your 401(k) and IRA would eventually be taxed as capital gains—at lower rates and not considered income. Unfortunately, you’d be wrong. Because of these rules, large 401(k) or IRA balances can result in significant taxable income during retirement, especially when factoring in Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs). Let's now go through an example how how a retiree could make more in retirement. Example Of A Retiree Earning More in Retirement Here’s how the combination of RMDs, Social Security, and a large 401(k) could lead to higher retirement income: Working Years: Annual Salary: $120,000 401(k) Contributions: $20,000 (pre-tax average annual contribution) Take-Home Pay After Contributions: $100,000 Retirement Years: 401(k) Balance: $2 million (after 30 years of growth) Social Security: $35,000 annually RMDs: At age 75, the IRS distribution factor is 22.9. RMD = $2,000,000 ÷ 22.9 ≈ $87,336 Total Retirement Income: RMD: $87,336 Social Security: $35,000 Total: $122,336 In this scenario, the retiree earns $2,336 more in retirement than while working. But in terms of taxable income, depending on where the person retires, the retiree earns $22,336 more in taxable income in retirement than while working. The $20,000 in annual untaxed 401(k) contribution while working one year simply shifted to taxable income in retirement. Why Retirement Income Also Feels Much Larger Even if you make just a little bit more in retirement than while working, it feels much larger due to the following reasons: No Need to Save for Retirement: The $20,000 saved annually during working years is now available for spending. Not saving for retirement once you are retired is one of the biggest “expense” savings working people do not fully account for. Treating investments as expenses is a smart mental trick to building more wealth over time. Lower Tax Rate: Social Security is taxed at a lower rate, and effective tax rates are often reduced for retirees. For example: A single filer with $122,336 income pays ~$8,060 in federal taxes after the standard deduction. A married filer with the same withdrawal income pays $0 to almost $0 in federal taxes due to higher 0% bracket thresholds and the standard deduction. Reduced Expenses: Commuting, work attire, and other work-related costs are eliminated in retirement. Earning Side Income Becomes More Enjoyable: For many retirees, part-time work becomes a fulfilling way to stay active. The difference is that you’re no longer working out of necessity but out of choice. This shift brings greater satisfaction as you enjoy being productive, helpful, and connected to your community. Earning Investment Income Feels Like Free Money: Earning passive investment income in retirement can feel almost like cheating—it requires no ongoing effort on your part. While it’s true that building up your investments initially demands significant work and discipline, over time, the power of compounding takes over. It's Been A Good Semi-Retirement So Far Despite earning about 80% less in total income during my first year of retirement, I didn’t feel much poorer. In my final two years of work, I had been saving over 70% of my income in anticipation of leaving the workforce. So my actual income available to spend only declined by about 10%. The retirement transition brought immense happiness as I gained full control over my time. I found joy in exploring free parks on weekdays, keeping myself entertained without spending much. Writing for Financial Samurai has also been far more fulfilling than working in banking. Without anyone dictating my tasks, I can freely explore my creativity and curiosity, writing about topics that truly interest me. While the income level is different, the joy of writing makes it worthwhile. When you’re willing to write for free, any online income generated feels like a bonus. Maybe We'll Earn More In Retirement After All Not accounting for 401(k) and IRA withdrawals as income was a blind spot in my earlier arguments for not wanting to contribute to a Roth IRA. Viewing these withdrawals as deferred income clarifies why they’re taxed as such. For all you super 401(k) and IRA savers, the pot of deferred income the government eventually forces you to tap will likely be substantial! Another thing I underappreciated was the power of compounding. Conceptually, I understood it, but it took another 15 years of experience to truly believe in its impact. The investment gains since April 2020 have been nothing short of extraordinary. Moreover, thanks to technology, more retirees are embracing side hustles to generate additional income. The very definition of retirement has evolved—from living a life of leisure to living a life of intentional purpose. If you want to contribute to a Roth IRA, go for it—especially if your marginal income tax rate is 24% or lower. Diversifying your retirement income sources is always a smart move. The only thing better than earning more in retirement than you did while working? Retiring early and making even more money not really working because you’re doing what you love!
