Do you have a box of sports cards from your childhood that you’re ready to let go of? If so, now may be the perfect time to turn those sports cards into extra income. Some sports cards may be worth a few dollars, and others may be worth thousands! The sports card market has boomed with record sales and increased interest in rare cards, popular athletes, vintage cards, and graded cards in mint condition. In this article, you’ll learn how to evaluate your cards, price the cards, and sell your sports cards so that you can make the most money. 12 Best Places To Sell Sports Cards Below are the best places to sell sports cards. 1. eBay  eBay is one of the best spots to sell sports cards due to its wide audience (everyone has heard of eBay!). People from all over the world can go to eBay and know they’re going to get a good selection of sports cards to purchase.  Selling your sports cards on eBay also allows you to choose auction-style or buy-it-now pricing. An auction is best if you’re unsure of the exact value, so you can set a starting bit and let buyers bid. Buy it now is the better option if you have a fixed selling price in mind. Now, there are seller fees to use eBay, but it can be well worth it if you want to cut out the middle person (always make sure to provide good customer service and upload high-resolution photos of the cards you are trying to sell). eBay also lets you promote your listing to increase visibility. You will have to pack and ship your sports cards securely and provide tracking information to the buyer, so all of the work is on you. 2. Beckett  Beckett Marketplace is a hot spot for selling sports cards, and that is what the site is known for. There’s even a section on the site that gives you a price estimate for your cards, making it easier to sell. You can sell a variety of different sports cards on Beckett Marketplace, including baseball, basketball, football, and more. Sellers can list their cards for sale and wait while buyers search for specific cards. This is definitely the go-to spot for serious sports enthusiasts to look for sports cards.  3. COMC  COMC (Check Out My Collectibles) is a platform known for buying, selling, and trading sports cards and other collectibles. COMC even allows you to send your sports cards to COMC, where they’ll professionally scan, list, and store your cards in a warehouse. You can still set your prices for your sports cards and take advantage of COMC’s grading services.  If your cards aren’t selling on COMC, some helpful tips include re-pricing your items more competitively, especially if you’re trying to get rid of your sports collection quicker. You may want to compare the same sports cards to yours and price it a little lower than theirs, so your cards get purchased first. 4. Dave \u0026 Adam’s  Dave \u0026 Adam’s is a major online and retail store specializing in selling sports cards, collectibles, and memorabilia. People can buy and sell all kinds of cards at Dave \u0026 Adam’s, including sports cards (baseball, basketball, and football), as well as non-sports cards like Pokemon and Magic. This platform also allows customers to sell their items in exchange for a business check, PayPal payment, Venmo, or a Dave \u0026 Adam’s store credit. This makes their site a popular spot for casual collectors and serious hobbyists to buy and sell online. 5. Facebook Marketplace  Facebook Marketplace is a popular spot to sell sports cards, whether you want to sell them locally or ship them to someone across the world. This platform is great for selling because you don’t have to pay listing or final sales fees, which helps maximize your profits. You also get access to a larger audience for quick, in-person transactions. Besides Facebook Marketplace, you can also join sports-related Facebook groups where you can post listings and give your sports cards exposure to collectors looking for your cards. 6. PSA card forums  PSA card forums make it easier to find people who are looking to buy, sell, and trade sports cards. Each forum has its own rules and guidelines for selling sports cards, including posting requirements and transaction procedures. It’s important to follow these rules so you don’t get kicked out of the forums. To sell your cards on a PSA card forum, you need to create a new thread in the selling section with a detailed description of each card. High-quality photos are super important, and you’ll want to post the front and the back of the cards.  7. Craigslist  I have sold on Craigslist in the past and it’s a great place if you want to not pay any fees (such as selling fees or commissions). Selling sports cards on Craigslist can be a good idea, depending on your local area and if people are buying sports cards. In some areas (such as smaller towns), Craigslist can be a harder place to sell simply because people may not be searching for sports cards in your specific area, though. To sell sports cards on Craigslist, you want to choose the category “Collectibles” or a similar category where sports cards would be a good fit. You’ll want to write a detailed description of the sports cards and include: Player name and team Year and card set  Condition Any special features Pricing and whether you’re open to negotiation You’ll also want to set up a safe meeting location like a police station parking lot or a library. As always, be careful with scams, and if something doesn’t feel right, stick with your gut and move on.  8. OfferUp  Selling sports cards on OfferUp is a simple process and lets you connect to local buyers. When creating your OfferUp listing, make sure to choose categories like “Collectibles” or “Sports Cards” so your listing gets seen by the right people.  Offerup does not have fees when you’re selling locally in person. However, there are fees if you decide to ship an item, which is usually around 12.9% of the item’s final price. Similar to Craigslist, you’ll want to arrange a safe transaction place and go with your gut if something doesn’t feel right.  9. Dean’s Cards Dean’s Cards is a platform specifically for buying and selling baseball cards. If you’re selling baseball cards, this is a great spot to list your cards since the audience is exactly who you’re looking for. Once a buyer decides to purchase your card(s), Dean’s Cards handles the transaction process, including payment and shipping. Dean’s Cards has an established reputation in the sports card industry, attracting serious buyers and collectors, which can lead to quicker sales.  10. Kruk Cards  Kruk Cards is an online marketplace that specializes in buying, selling, and trading sports cards. The site features a wide range of products, including individual cards, complete sets, and memorabilia from sports like baseball, basketball, football, and hockey.  This site also has tools and resources for pricing cards, making it easier for sellers to set competitive prices. Kruk Cards does not charge listing fees, which allows you to keep more of your profits from sales. However, some sales can be under a commission structure, which means a percentage of the sale price will be deducted (so, there is most likely still a fee as the site does need to make money after all!).  11. Pawn shop Local pawn shops in your area may specialize in buying and selling sports cards, so they may give a better price for your cards. You can start by calling pawn shops in your area to see if they buy sports cards and see what they want with it. If there is a pawn shop near you, I do recommend that you grab any proof of authenticity certifications, grading certificates, or receipts of your cards as this can help in negotiations at the pawn shop. You can also visit several pawn shops in your area to see who can pay you the most money. Now, pawn shops typically don’t give a lot for trading cards, as they need to make money as well and have to resell the cards. So, if you want to make the most money, then you may want to shop around and see who will give you the most money. But, if you’re looking to get cash more quickly and want to sell your cards in person, then this may be the route to go with as it’s usually pretty easy to sell to a pawn shop. 12. SportsCardPro SportsCardPro is an online marketplace for buying, selling, and trading sports cards. It’s a great platform for collectors and enthusiasts to connect, list cards, and browse inventory. The platform also has tools you can use for pricing based on market trends, helping you set competitive prices. Frequently Asked Questions Below are common questions asked about selling sports cards for money. Are sports cards worth anything anymore? Sports cards can still be valuable depending on several factors, such as: Sports cards in mint or near-mint condition Limited edition cards, short prints, and cards from specific sets or years Cards featuring star players, especially those who are Hall of Famers Autographed cards Cards with historical significance  It’s best to talk to a professional appraiser if you think you have valuable cards. You can also check recent auctions of sports cards to get price estimates for similar cards.  How do I get my sports cards’ value? How to know if a sports card is worth money? There are a few ways to determine the value of your sports cards, but the most common ways include checking the grading of the card by using a grading service like PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator) or SGC (Sportscard Guaranty). These grading services can provide a standardized assessment of a card’s condition. The higher the grade generally means, the higher the card’s value.  If you would rather keep things more simple, you can look up recent sales of similar cards on platforms like eBay or Beckett Marketplace.  How do I sell my sports cards?  To sell your sports cards, first figure out where you want to sell your sports cards. You may decide to sell your sports cards on an online marketplace like eBay or Etsy, an auction house, a local card shop, to a card dealer, at card shows, or on social media platforms. If you’re selling your sports cards online, it’s important to take high-quality photos of your sports cards. The description of your online listing should contain the following: Player name and team Year the card was produced Specify the card’s number from the set Condition, highlighting any imperfections If the card is graded, include the grading company and the grade Special features like autographs, jersey patches If the card is rare, a rookie card, or part of a limited edition And, anything else you can think of. Where is the best place to sell cards online?  The best place to sell cards online depends on your goal and how quickly you’re looking to sell your sports cards. Some popular places to sell cards online include eBay, COMC (Check Out My Cards), Beckett Marketplace, Facebook Marketplace, and Facebook groups that specialize in sports cards. Where can I sell sports cards online instantly? If you want to sell your sports cards right away, your best options are eBay (since they have a large audience), Facebook Marketplace (since you can sell locally and not deal with shipping), or a card listing site. What is the best place to sell ungraded sports cards? Ungraded trading cards can be harder to sell than graded ones as the value is more variable and depends on the card’s condition and the buyer’s willingness to take a chance on potential grading. Some of the best places to sell ungraded sports cards include eBay, Facebook Marketplace, social media including Facebook groups, Reddit, and Mercari. What are the most valuable sports cards? The most valuable sports cards vary greatly depending on factors like rarity, condition, historical significance, and demand. Right now, the most valuable sports cards include:  Honus Wagner at a value of $6-7 million  Michael Jordan 1986-87 Fleer Rookie Card #57 at a value of $100,000 – $750,000 Babe Ruth 1933 Goudey #144 at a value of $500,000 – $1 million LeBron James 2003-04 Upper Deck Exquisite Collection Rookie Patch Auto at a value of $200,000 – $1 million Mickey Mantle 1952 Topps #311 at a value of $500,000 – $2.5 million Wayne Gretzky 1979 O-Pee-Chee #18 at a value of $100,000 – $300,000 As you can see, sports memorabilia can be quite valuable!
