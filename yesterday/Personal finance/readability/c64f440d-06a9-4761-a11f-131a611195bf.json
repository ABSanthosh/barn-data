Most often: “The brokerage firm didn’t report the distribution as a QCD. I just got a regular Form 1099-R which included the distribution.” “The receipt from the charity did not confirm that the distribution was a QCD.” “The brokerage firm made the check out to the charity but sent it to me.” The good news is: none of those are problems. The first two are in fact explicitly what you should expect. The third is also normal and in fact often desirable, relative to having the check mailed directly to the charity. The Brokerage Firm Doesn’t Know It’s a QCD Your brokerage firm does not report that a distribution is a qualified charitable distribution, because they don’t know. The brokerage firm does not confirm whether the payee on the check is a qualified charity. And the brokerage firm has no way to know if you already made other QCDs for the year (i.e., from a traditional IRA with another brokerage firm) and have thus already reached the annual limit. So the brokerage firm is just going to send you a regular Form 1099-R for the year that includes all your distributions, QCD and otherwise. Here’s how the IRS explains it: “In early 2024, the IRA owner will receive Form 1099-R from their IRA trustee that shows any IRA distributions made during calendar year 2023, including both regular distributions and QCDs. The total distribution is shown in Box 1 on that form. There is no special code for a QCD.” The Charity Doesn’t Know It’s a QCD Similarly, the charity isn’t going to confirm for you that the distribution is a QCD, because they also have no way to know. They likely don’t know your age, but even if they do, they (like the brokerage firm) have no way of knowing whether you’ve already exceeded the annual limit by other QCDs earlier in the year. So the charity is just going to send you a receipt that says, “thanks for your donation of $X. You did not receive any goods or services in exchange for this donation.” So, in short, it’s up to you to know whether the distribution is a QCD and report it accordingly. The brokerage firm doesn’t know. The charity doesn’t know. Check Delivered to You The IRC section that defines qualified charitable distributions (§ 408(d)(8)(B)) explicitly states that the distribution must be made “directly” by the trustee to the qualifying non-profit organization. So I understand why people might be concerned if the check arrives in their own mailbox. But, to be clear: It’s OK if the check is made out to the charity but delivered to you and you forward it to the charity. It’s not OK for the check to be made out to you (or for the funds to be electronically distributed from the IRA to your own account). In that case it’s not a QCD. It’s just a regular distribution. In fact, that’s often preferable to have the check made out to the charity but mailed to you, because it gives you a chance to scan the check for your records. One Last Tip Don’t wait until the last minute to execute a QCD. We want to make sure that the charity has plenty of time to cash the check this year. If it’s a check that you write from the IRA (as some brokerages offer check-writing privileges with their IRAs), and it doesn’t get cashed, then it would not be a distribution for the year in question. That could be a problem if you were relying on the QCD to count toward your RMD for the year, or if you were planning on making the maximum QCD next year. If the check was written by the custodian, then it will have been a distribution for the year in question. (But even then there’s still a possibility that the check gets lost/stolen in the mail and never deposited, in which case the funds may be refunded to your account.) Better to do any QCDs relatively early in the year, so that there’s plenty of time for these things to resolve themselves, within the same tax year. Among people who read personal finance books, many save a high percentage of their income through most of their careers. One thing that eventually happens for some such people is that they reach a point at which they realize they have not only saved \"enough,\" they have saved \"more than enough.\" Their desired standard of living in retirement is well secured, and it’s likely that a major part of the portfolio is eventually going to be left to loved ones and/or charity. And that realization raises a whole list of new questions and concerns. This book’s goal is to help you answer those questions.",
