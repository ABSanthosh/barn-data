Or maybe you just don’t have the time or energy to fuss over a plant every day. The good news is, you don’t need a green thumb to enjoy the benefits of indoor plants. Some houseplants are so tough, they can survive almost anything you throw at them. If you want to add some green to your space without the stress, this list is for you. Here are ten houseplants that are almost impossible to kill—even if you’ve failed before.1. Snake PlantThe snake plant, also called Sansevieria or mother-in-law’s tongue, is famous for its toughness. It can handle low light, dry air, and missed waterings. The thick, upright leaves store water, so you don’t need to water them often. In fact, overwatering is the main way people kill this plant. Just let the soil dry out between waterings. Snake plants also help clean the air, making them a smart choice for bedrooms and offices.2. ZZ PlantThe ZZ plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia) is almost indestructible. Its waxy, dark green leaves look good even if you forget about it for weeks. It tolerates low light and only needs water when the soil is dry. The ZZ plant is also resistant to pests and disease. If you want a plant that thrives on neglect, this is it. Just keep it out of direct sunlight, which can scorch the leaves.3. PothosPothos is a classic beginner plant. Its trailing vines and heart-shaped leaves grow fast, even in low light. Pothos can survive in water or soil, and it bounces back quickly if you forget to water it. You can trim the vines to keep them tidy or let them trail for a wild look. Pothos is also known for filtering toxins from the air, making it a healthy addition to your home.4. Spider PlantSpider plants are easy to grow and hard to kill. They like bright, indirect light, but can handle low light too. Water them when the soil feels dry, and they’ll reward you with long, arching leaves and baby “spiderettes” that you can replant. Spider plants are non-toxic to pets, so they’re a safe choice if you have cats or dogs. They also help remove pollutants from indoor air.5. Peace LilyPeace lilies are forgiving and beautiful. They can survive in low light and only need water about once a week. The glossy leaves will droop when the plant is thirsty, so it’s easy to know when to water. Peace lilies also produce white flowers that last for weeks. They’re great for improving air quality, but keep them away from pets, as the leaves can be toxic if eaten.6. Cast Iron PlantThe cast iron plant (Aspidistra elatior) lives up to its name. It can handle low light, temperature changes, and irregular watering. The dark green leaves grow slowly but steadily, and the plant rarely has problems with pests. If you want a plant you can almost forget about, the cast iron plant is a solid pick. It’s perfect for shady corners where other plants struggle.7. Aloe VeraAloe vera is more than just a tough plant—it’s useful too. The thick, spiky leaves contain a gel that can soothe burns and cuts. Aloe likes bright, indirect light and needs water only when the soil is dry. Too much water can cause root rot, so it’s better to underwater than overwater. Aloe vera is a good choice for sunny windowsills and people who want a low-maintenance, practical plant.8. Jade PlantJade plants are succulents that can live for decades with minimal care. They need bright light and occasional watering. Let the soil dry out between waterings to prevent root rot. Jade plants grow slowly and can be pruned to keep their shape. They’re also said to bring good luck, which can’t hurt. If you want a tough and attractive plant, jade is a great option.9. PhilodendronPhilodendrons are popular for their heart-shaped leaves and easy-going nature. They adapt to a range of light conditions, from low to bright indirect light. Water when the top inch of soil is dry. Philodendrons are forgiving if you forget to water now and then. They also grow well in hanging baskets or on shelves, adding a lush look to any room.10. Rubber PlantThe rubber plant (Ficus elastica) is sturdy and striking. Its large, glossy leaves make a bold statement. Rubber plants like bright, indirect light, but can handle lower light too. Water the soil when it is dry to the touch. They can grow tall over time, but you can prune them to keep them manageable. Rubber plants are also known for their air-purifying abilities.Green Without the GuiltYou don’t need to be a plant expert to enjoy houseplants. The ten houseplants listed here are tough enough for almost anyone. They can handle missed waterings, low light, and a little neglect. Adding greenery to your home doesn’t have to be stressful or expensive. With these easy-care options, you can enjoy the benefits of plants—like cleaner air and a more relaxing space—without the worry. Try one or two and see how simple it can be to keep something alive.What’s your experience with “unkillable” houseplants?
