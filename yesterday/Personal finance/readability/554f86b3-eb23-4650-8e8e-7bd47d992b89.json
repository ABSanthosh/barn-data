If you like baking bread, desserts, and other yummy treats, running a side hustle or full-time business selling baked goods could be for you! I’ve always loved small businesses that sell cookies, sourdough, cupcakes, and more – whether it’s at a farmers market, a cute local cafe or food truck, or even just being shared through Facebook posts. There’s something so great about homemade baked goods, and I know I’m not alone. If you like spending time in the kitchen and want to turn that into a side hustle to make extra money (or even a full-time business), then this guide is for you. I’m sharing the best places to sell baked goods so you can start making money doing something you enjoy. Where To Sell Baked Goods Below are the best places to sell baked goods. Recommended reading: 10 Ways To Make Money Baking 1. Farmers markets Your local farmers market is a great way to get started selling baked goods. People love high-quality, handmade goods and this gives you a chance to build relationships with people and get repeat customers. For example, my sister goes to a farmers market near her home nearly every week and goes to two stands – the produce stand and the bakery stand – she loves getting a loaf of bread and a dip to have as a snack, and her family has made it a part of their routine! With an organized setup, clear labeling, and a display (it doesn’t have to be much – showcase your beautiful baked goods!), you can turn your baked goods business into a sustainable form of income. Tips for selling at farmers markets: Give samples to attract customers. Show display prices clearly. Label all items clearly (vegan, gluten-free, nut-free, etc.). 2. Local Facebook groups Local Facebook groups are a great way to get into selling your goods if you’re just getting your business off the ground. With this method of selling via Facebook groups, you don’t necessarily need a website, social media, or a physical setup. You simply post photos of your baked goods in Facebook groups and build your business this way. This allows you to create a loyal customer base right from home. Tips for selling on Facebook: Take high-quality, well-lit photos of your baked goods. Share important details like allergens, pricing, order deadlines. Respond to messages and comments quickly. Follow the Facebook group rules and don’t spam. Share if you do delivery/pickup. I’m in a local Facebook group and I have seen people selling loaves of bread, decorated cookies, and more. The pictures of your baked goods sell themselves, so you don’t need to do a lot of advertising or explaining, which is nice! 3. Your own website Having your own website for your baked goods business is a great way to stand out and look very professional. Your website can showcase everything you sell, share your story, and even accept orders 24/7.  Your website can also include a photo gallery (pictures of what you are selling or your home bakery setup), an FAQ section (your costs, shipping methods, etc.), and even a blog where you share behind-the-scenes updates. Tips for selling on your website: Use high-quality, well-lit photos for every baked treat. Make ordering simple and secure. Add a contact form or contact email address so people can ask questions. Label each menu item clearly with allergens. Include reviews from happy customers. Update with seasonal and special items. You can start your own website by using this tutorial for WordPress here or even starting one on Shopify. 4. Pet stores (for baked dog treats) If you love pets and want to get into a niche space, you may want to try baking and selling dog treats. The pet industry is a huge moneymaker, and people love supporting small businesses that bake and sell dog treats over the mass-produced items. I have three dogs and I love buying special treats for them! You can sell your dog treats wholesale or on a consignment basis, which is when you receive payment once the treats are sold. Tips for selling in pet stores: Reach out to pet stores with your items and give samples. Be clear about pricing and terms. Focus on quality ingredients to stand out. Highlight the benefits of your dog treats such as being organic or free of artificial additives.  Keep good communication and follow up regularly. I recommend reading How I Earned Up to $4,000 Per Month Baking Dog Treats (With Zero Baking Experience!) to learn more. Plus, you can sign up for this free training workshop that will teach you how to start your own side hustle of baking and selling dog treats. There is also a Free Peanut Butter Dog Treat Recipe you can get too. 5. Etsy Etsy is a popular site for selling handmade items, including baked goods. Yes, I know that many people don’t realize that they sell baked goods on Etsy, but it is actually quite popular! This is a great spot to sell your treats, especially cakes, cookies, and pet treats. There are millions of active users on Etsy who specifically go on this platform to support small businesses. You can see examples of baked goods for sale on Etsy by clicking here. As you can see, there are many different baked goods for sale on Etsy, such as cookies, bread, pastries, and even baked desserts from around the world. Setting up an Etsy shop is fairly easy, and the platform has many tools to set you up for success. Keep in mind that Etsy does charge fees, so this will cut into your profit. But, you can market to people all over instead of just in your town, which is nice. Tips for selling on Etsy: Upload high-quality photos of your baked items. Write detailed descriptions with ingredients and allergens. Sell customization options like personalized cakes or cookies. Use relevant keywords in your listing. Set clear shipping and delivery options. Recommended reading: 16 Best Things To Sell On Etsy To Make Money 6. Local coffee shops Partnering with a local coffee shop to sell your baked items is a great way to get business. People are always looking to grab a treat with their coffee, so this is the perfect place to sell baked goods. Locally owned coffee shops usually love partnering with small businesses to feature locally made fresh treats. So, you may want to reach out to local coffee shops with your baked goods and share how well your treats would go with their coffee. Some coffee shops still let you sell on a wholesale basis. Tips for selling to coffee shops: Sell a variety of items (cookies, cupcakes, brownies). Highlight the high-quality ingredients you use. Include allergen-friendly desserts. Follow up regularly to make sure your products are selling well. 7. Your own food truck Launching your own food truck business can be a rewarding way to sell baked goods but can get expensive. This is the route to go if you want full control over your business and where you sell. This method also allows you to connect with customers face-to-face.  With the right setup, you can build a strong business selling baked goods. You can serve fresh goods daily, create custom orders, and make seasonal items. Starting a food truck has quite a bit more upfront investments involved, but also opens the door to more visibility and success down the road. Tips for running a food truck: Keep the menu easy to read with allergens listed. Get on social media and go hard on marketing. Choose high-traffic areas and always post online where you’ll be parked. Make sure you have proper licenses, permits, and insurance. I really love food trucks that sell baked goods and shop at them all the time. 8. Bake sales Bake sales are a traditional and effective way to sell baked goods for those just starting out or looking to raise money. These are usually hosted at schools, churches, community centers, and other local events. These are usually low-cost and a great entry-level way to get practice in this business. Bake sales can be profitable when done right. You’ll usually want to sell many different items so that more people are interested in what you have made. Don’t forget business cards so people can order from you directly in the future. Tips for bake sales: Keep prices clear and affordable. Have a variety of treats and flavors. Make your table inviting and welcoming. Have a way of accepting digital payments. Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about selling baked goods. Is selling baked goods profitable? Yes, selling baked goods can be profitable as long as you keep costs low and mainly focus on popular items that sell. Ingredients you’ll use like flour, sugar, and butter can be pretty inexpensive, especially when bought in bulk. Profitability does depend on your pricing, portion control, packaging, and where you’re selling (farmers markets or local Facebook groups). Starting small at home or local events will help you test what sells the best and build a loyal following without a ton of expenses right at the start. Now, you most likely won’t make millions a year selling baked goods (you would most likely need a commercial kitchen and a LOT of sales to do this!), but you may be able to make a good side hustle income or a full-time income with the right strategies. Do you need a license to sell baked goods from home? You may need a license or permit to sell baked goods from home, but requirements and regulations will depend on where you live. Quite a few U.S. states have a “cottage food law” which means you can prepare and sell certain nonperishable baked goods from your home kitchen without a commercial license. But, you’ll always want to check your city, county, or state’s specific cottage food laws before starting, to make sure you’re selling legally. Some may require an inspection for food safety, labeling requirements, refrigeration rules, or business licensing, depending on the exact business you are planning on running. What baked goods sell the most? Some of the best baked goods that sell the most are the classics. This includes: Chocolate chip cookies Brownies and bars Cupcakes Muffins Cinnamon rolls Bread Mini pies or tarts Dog treats Pastries Some bakers may specialize in one area (such as cookies or sourdough bread) and others may have a lot of different types of baked goods inventory and even related items like jams and jellies. Is it legal to sell baked goods on Etsy? It’s legal to sell baked goods on Etsy as long as you follow Etsy’s guidelines and follow your local food laws. Some states allow nonperishable baked goods under the cottage food law, but these requirements depend on where you live. Also, here’s a link to Etsy’s rules on food and edible items. Can I sell homemade dog treats on Etsy? Yes, you can sell baked treats on Etsy, but you must follow their rules. Dog treats have the same rules as regular human baked goods.  How to sell baked goods on Instagram? Selling baked goods on Instagram is a great way to get free marketing and new customers. To get started, you’ll need to create a business Instagram profile (it’s easy to do this), which gives you access to tools like Insights, contact buttons, and ads. Then, you’ll want to post high-quality photos of your baked goods and use good lighting and clean backgrounds (no messy counter space!). Also, use captions to share what makes your treats different (ingredients, allergen-free, or personal story), make sure to engage with followers, answer questions, and make it easy and clear on how to order your baked goods via Instagram.  Where are the best places to sell baked goods online? The best places to sell baked goods online include Etsy, local Facebook groups, Instagram, and your own website. Each of these options has its own pros and cons, so it’s good to think about what is important to you, how much money you have available to spend on your business, and how soon you want to get started selling baked goods.

There are so many baked goods you can sell, including cookies, brownies, cupcakes, sourdough loaves, cakes, and pies, and you can even niche into a market like gluten-free, vegan, nut-free, and keto.

Ingredients you’ll use like flour, sugar, and butter can be pretty inexpensive, especially when bought in bulk. Profitability does depend on your pricing, portion control, packaging, and where you’re selling (farmers markets or local Facebook groups). Starting small at home or local events will help you test what sells the best and build a loyal following without a ton of expenses right at the start. Now, you most likely won’t make millions a year selling baked goods (you would most likely need a commercial kitchen and a LOT of sales to do this!), but you may be able to make a good side hustle income or a full-time income with the right strategies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you need a license to sell baked goods from home?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may need a license or permit to sell baked goods from home, but requirements and regulations will depend on where you live. Quite a few U.S. states have a “cottage food law” which means you can prepare and sell certain nonperishable baked goods from your home kitchen without a commercial license. But, you’ll always want to check your city, county, or state’s specific cottage food laws before starting, to make sure you’re selling legally. Some may require an inspection for food safety, labeling requirements, refrigeration rules, or business licensing, depending on the exact business you are planning on running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat baked goods sell the most?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the best baked goods that sell the most are the classics.
