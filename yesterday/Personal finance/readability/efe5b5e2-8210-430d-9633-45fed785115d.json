In this episode, I share how I built Stevebot, a custom AI assistant powered by a rag database that mimics my brain. We break down the tech stack, the biggest mistakes made, and how this changes the classes that I teach forever. But before we begin, I want to let you know that the session recordings for Seller Summit 2025 are available over at sellersummit.com. If you missed the event,00:26 You can now get instant access to every keynote, workshop, and panel. Go to SellersSummit.com. Now on to the show.00:40 Welcome to the My Way, Quit or Job podcast. Today we’re gonna talk about a couple projects that I’ve been working on and I was a little hesitant to talk about this because I hope it doesn’t bore you guys. Tony says it’ll be interesting. Well, we’ll see. It’s just a selfish reason. I wanna know about SteveBot. My first concern is do we need another Steve? Okay, wait, we didn’t even tell people what I’m working on. It’s called SteveBot. It’s SteveBot. Yes.01:08 And I have to say that I’ve learned more in the last two days than I have in probably like the last year. This is completely new to me. How all this stuff works and everything. But I did create Steve bot. I did this for the course because I kept getting questions that were already covered in the videos in the, the class. But since there’s like 450 videos, I get it right.01:37 you probably didn’t watch the one that yielded the answer. Right. And this is a common problem that, that I’ve been having actually in the last few years with the class, probably the last two or three years. Yeah. When the volume of videos, even though I’m pruning them, I’m also constantly adding new ones every single week. Yeah. And the level of information is, is overwhelming for a lot of people. Cause so I always say upfront, you shouldn’t watch everything. Yeah. Just watch what you’re actively implementing anyway.02:07 You know, I’ve just to speak on that for a minute. I think that’s the case for both courses because I know that we have been on lives and doing, you know, office hours and things like that. And someone will ask a question. And I know we’ve done a lesson on it, right? Because I know that I did gave the lesson or we did it together, whatever. But, you know, I can’t remember which lesson it’s in because a lot of times, too, I think for the courses, we get so granular in the information. like the lesson is really specific on one thing.02:37 It’s like, well then is it in that one or is it in this one? Because they’re both talking about, let’s just say lead magnet and welcome flows, right? So which one, so I actually think this is gonna be good because personally for me, like I need it just to keep up with everything that we’re doing. Yeah, so that was the goal. And then I had to run down this whole rabbit hole of implementation, learning how to train AI models and all that stuff.03:06 It is so fascinating. But at the same time, once you get down to like the nitty gritty, it’s actually very basic what it does. okay, so the overall goal was so that instead of asking, hey, you what lesson is this in or whatever, you just ask Steve Bot, and then it gives you the answer to that question. And then it gives you a link to the video that covered it. Okay. Right. And so,03:34 If the answer didn’t answer it thoroughly, you go and you watch the video. Right. That sounds fantastic. So it’s like a much better version of search. Uh, in practice doing that is a little bit more difficult because you can’t literally, you can’t just shove all of your stuff into AI. kind of doesn’t work that way. So the limitations are, so there’s, um, like I said, there’s like 450 ish videos and the first tall task actually.04:02 was automating, generating transcripts from all the videos. So the first thing I did is I downloaded all of the videos into a directory, just the ones that are active, because believe it not, there’s like close to 800 videos, I think. I mean, I believe it. The course is what? 13, 14 years old at this point? is 14 years old. Yeah. Right? So I had all these videos in there that were taken down, right? Cause they’re obsolete or whatever. Right. But they’re still, so I had to find the ones that were active.04:32 which meant writing some WordPress routines to just grab the active posts. That wasn’t that hard. And then downloading them to a directory. Then you need to grab transcripts of all of them, right? And this is where I went a little cheap. So the transcripts, you can feed them into OpenAI and get them done. But OpenAI actually open sourced a model for free and it’s called Whisper.05:02 You can run all that locally on your machine if you have a good video card. Actually, it’s still running right now. I was hoping to launch SteveVot today. It’s only at video 300 right now, and it’s at the rate of three minutes per video. When you think about it, that’s really fast. Yes, it’s fast. If I didn’t skimp on my video card, it probably would have been done overnight.05:30 But I don’t play games. I didn’t really have a use for a video, a good video card until. You needed Kevin for this. Where’s Kevin? I did. I’m sure Kevin has a really nice video card. So just I want to ask a question about this. It’s slightly unrelated, but so I don’t know if you know this, but if you have videos on Facebook that were live, so anything to any time you go live on Facebook, right? Facebook has said that they’re taking those down now, like after 30 days. Yeah. So what we have done is downloaded all those05:59 videos that we wanna keep, right? Because some of them are good, right? And like for us, we don’t do a ton on Facebook Live, so it wouldn’t be like as important to what you and I do, but like for Happy Housewife, I did a lot of live recipes, I’ve done a lot of live tips, you there’s a lot of content. I think about someone like Laurie from Passionate Pennypinscher, who has tons of live content on Facebook. So step one was download it all, right?06:25 But now we want to be able to possibly like re-record those, right, on YouTube and stuff like that. So my issue is the transcript side, right? Because they’re not already on YouTube, right? Now they’re in my drive. So what’s the best? That’s the easy part. Is it? So what’s the best method to get the transcripts? Because like I tried ChatGPT, that was an absolute bust.06:49 Whoa, why? Oh, yeah, you can’t you can’t just feed it in chat. Yeah, and it’s like it’ll do it in 30 second increments. And I was like, this is not going to work. Yeah. The way you do it is you can probably use make doc. Like if you don’t want to code, I assume you want to code. No, I’m not. And you’re willing to money, right? Yes, but like not a ton of money, right? So I started researching. Yeah. So what I was thinking, though, this is going to happen to a lot of people, right? A lot of people have videos that they need to probably get now because of Facebook’s new policy. What do we do?07:19 By the way, is this only for live videos? can’t remember. It’s just for live videos. videos. That’s what they’ve said so far. you know. Okay. So what you do is you can use make.com. Okay. Throw all your videos in Dropbox and then create an automation that feeds it into the OpenAI Whisper model. And if you guys are listening to this, you have no idea what I’m talking about. Make.com is like a workflow type of tool. Okay. The hardest part about creating any app is making things talk to each other, right?07:47 So essentially you need to make Dropbox talk to OpenAI. That’s exactly what this does. You drop down a Dropbox widget. It feeds the files over to OpenAI, the whisper model. It’s super cheap. It’s like 0.00001 cents per token, which works out to be, I don’t know, like 50 cents maybe for a… So you have to use the token model. Gotcha. Yeah. Anyway, and then you just have it drop those transcripts.08:17 transcriptions into Dropbox again in a different folder. Okay, that’s a good tip. So just talking about the transcript side of things because I looked and I started doing some research and you know, you can there’s a lot of services are really expensive or okay. Wait, if you want the free model, that’s even easier than that. Okay, Riverside FM offers a free transcription service. Interesting. You just have to drag it over manually though. Yeah. So when I when I asked Chad GPT, you know, how can I do this for free?08:46 Their top tip which I actually you know This is something where I think if you have an overseas VA or something like that This would be probably worth doing is basically upload them all to YouTube and have YouTube do the transcripts privately This is way better than that. Yeah, I don’t know your idea sounds way better. I’m saying that’s what they gave me Oh, no, no, no, I meant the free riverside method. Yeah, that’s what I’m saying. That sounds better than Because obviously you don’t want them public on YouTube. So I mean how many videos are we talking about here?09:15 I don’t think, Happy Housewife probably only has, it has under 50. Oh, okay. Then just do the hand drag method. Yeah. One of my clients though, I think we have over a hundred. Okay. hundred even is also borderline hand drag. Yeah, cause you’ve got thousands that you’re dealing with. Oh, and it’s not even, if this goes well, I might do this with a podcast and every blog post on my So that people can find something quickly if they have a question.09:42 Yeah, because sometimes there’s something in the class that was covered actually in a blog post, but I didn’t do like a whole video on it. Right. Right. I feel like that happens actually a lot, especially when we do our webinars, people ask a question and usually the answer can be found in one of the blog posts that you have. Correct. YouTube at this point. Now it’s YouTube for you. Really. I was debating whether to to include my blog post in it because Google has kind of already done that for me.10:11 You know what I mean? It’s already been read. The YouTube videos is also another avenue. I don’t know. I just want to get the course videos here first. The goal also was to consider just charging for the bot. I don’t know. Charge for people to be able to use the bot. Correct. But not people in the course. No, obviously not people in the class. Just like a…10:39 It’s like a stepping stone into joining the full class, so to speak. Got you. You did the next step, got the transcripts. You get the transcripts. Here’s what’s-10:49 Here’s what like confounded me about the whole process. I was under the impression that you could just throw it all into OpenAI and it just magically trains it. Right? That’s what we’re led to believe. Yes. I I believe I’m a believer. There’s a couple of limitations though. One, you can only feed in so many, so much information at one time. Yes. Cause all these models have context windows, right? And so what you have to do is you have to break up11:19 each of these transcripts into blocks. Individual transcripts have to be broken up as well. Yes, think about it. If you have a 20-minute video, the context window might be like a thousand words. I don’t know the exact limit site. I just ask you GPT for what a good block size was. A good block size is 500. I don’t know where that got that from, but basically you need to break these into chunks. If you can,11:49 you summarize each of those chunks and you tag them. think about like a video, let’s say we do a podcast. We talk about a lot of different stuff on this podcast, right? Yes, we do. So you can’t just shove it all in. And since we skip topics all the time, a podcast ironically is probably the hardest thing to train the AI for. So what you need to do is ideally you give it, you break it into chunks that are all about one topic.12:16 and then you name the topic and whatnot, and then you feed it in that way. Now, ironically, and this gets really, you can actually use AI to pre-process the transcript into these chunks before you train the AI itself. Okay, because that was my next question. Yeah. I didn’t have time to do a really thorough job of that in the first iteration, but the way my videos are laid out in the class, it’s already,12:44 pretty good, right? I only cover a very specific topic and I cover it for 10 to 15 minutes and then I move on. So in itself, each of my lessons are already kind of pretty good to go. Whereas with a podcast, especially if it’s with you or any guests, we talk about like 10 topics. Sometimes we skip all over the place. That’s harder. Okay, so.13:10 My next question is, you’re doing this in reverse right now, right? All the content’s already been created. Moving forward, as you create, you’re giving a lesson today on Stevebot, right? In That’s not the lesson, actually. I have to work on the lesson right after this. I’m going to introduce Stevebot if it’s ready. Hypothetically, you’re giving a Stevebot lesson today in the course. Moving forward, is there another way to do it so that you’re not doing all these sort of13:38 Because right now you’re going back and getting all the stuff that’s already happened. Moving forward, is there a way to do it where you don’t have to, you can skip some of these steps? No, you always have to do these steps. What do you mean? I don’t understand. So like right now you had to take all your videos, download them, get them and drop. You had this whole process, right? To get the transcript, to divide the transcript up. But like today, as you give the lesson, is there any way to do it as you’re giving it?14:07 Oh, as I’m giving the lesson. So yeah, like pre and I guess not pre because there’s nothing pre done about it. But like, you know, so you’re maybe skipping being able to skip some steps.14:18 No, I mean all the steps are gonna be there. And in fact, what’s unfortunate about Stevebot is like when a lesson comes on, I have to manually retrain the model again with the new lessons so that it knows how to answer stuff in that lesson. So I’m probably only gonna update Stevebot like once. It doesn’t take very long to be fair. It literally takes, I don’t know, probably 10 minutes. It’s not all automated right now either, right? Because I’m just trying to get the thing up.14:47 So there’s like several manual steps I’m doing. But yeah, once it becomes all automated, in theory, once the video is there, I just throw in a directory and it automatically updates Steve. I’m not there yet, obviously. Yeah, yeah. So when you say, you give a lesson today on Stevebot, you have to train it, what does that entail? That’s what I was just talking about. You gotta break up the transcript into logical blocks. So that’s all that is. There’s nothing else after that.15:15 Yeah, I mean, so the more information and context you can give it, the better the training will be. right now what I do is I give it a title, like of that chunk, and then I tag it with the URL and then the title of the video so that if it ends up grabbing from that chunk, the URL is automatically embedded and it tells you which video it’s part of. And then it gives you a little mini title. So that Cbot will send people to the correct.15:43 location to get the rest of the information. Correct. Correct. I’ve only tested this on like three lessons so far and so far it’s pretty good because I got to upload the rest. mean, it takes time to run all this stuff, right? Yeah. Yeah. Like through AI. So here’s where it’s like so simple and kind of brain dead. The way it works is and I kept asking you, is this really the best practice that everyone’s using? And they’re like, yep, this is, this is what all these companies are doing.16:13 What’s dumb about this whole thing is you ask it a question. Here’s how it works. And I’ll try to keep it as simple as possible. You ask it a question. OpenAI turns that question into math. Okay. Right? A vector or whatever. And then what happens behind the scenes is it takes that math vector and it compares it to all the little chunks that you’ve broken up. Right? For similarity.16:41 Right? Whether basically whether that chunk will answer that question. And then it returns a bunch of chunks. And then based on the chunks that are returned, AKA parts of the transcript, that gets only that little chunk of 500 words gets fed into AI to summarize the answer. Interesting. It’s not like AI knows all of your stuff and you’re loading up everything. Right. You’re doing most of the work.17:10 and feeding AI only the portion that you believe answers the question. Okay. So how do you see this as a obviously,17:23 Obviously for your students, this is a huge value add. Yes. Right. This is I feel like this is going to be such a game changer for the course, because I remember when I first met you and you had had the course, I don’t know, maybe four years. Right. But you already had several hundred lessons in the course. Yeah. It was really it wasn’t well organized because you had asked me like, I’d like some feedback. And I was like, I can’t find anything. Yeah.17:46 And then you did a really good job of rearranging everything. when you get started, start here. If you’re here, go here. You took people on a trail. So to me, the value add for the students, phenomenal. The ease of getting information. I think this on the flip side for you, the cut down on customer service, answering questions that are available for people to find on their own is the other benefit, the cross benefit.18:17 If you don’t have a course, right? Like how do you see this benefiting you outside of the course? I haven’t even thought that far ahead, Tony. I’ve been head down trying to learn all this stuff. There’s a lot of technical pieces involved. Oh, I’m sure. Yeah. But going forward, I was going to do a trial. Here’s what I was thinking. Like I’m going to build a community in the end, right? Yes. I mean, I have ideas for you. That’s why I’m asking. want to see where you are. do. OK, so I’ll tell you mine. I want to hear yours. OK, yeah.18:46 I want to build a much bigger community that obviously goes beyond the course. The course members will always be the top priority. But a tripwire, so to speak, would maybe be to give them access where they can ask questions to Steve Bot for something ridiculously cheap, like $5 a month or something like that. I don’t know. That doesn’t include any of live portions. I think the live office hours and the live Zooms are always going to be the value add in the Discord group. And then once they’re in the Bot, if they like,19:16 the questions and whatnot, then they can consider joining the full class. Plus, this makes great content. Oh, yeah, absolutely. But as far as after that, I’m going to do it for profitable audience. And that, in theory, should be faster because I know what I’m doing now. And there’s a lot less content in there. There’s only a couple hundred lessons. And then maybe I’ll make a Tony bot where the bot responds and like… With hugs.19:46 I haven’t even done the fun stuff yet. I can make it like reply as me and use Steve-isms, you know what saying? Yes. See, I think that’s really fun. I mean, this is dumb. We were talking about this with some friends last night about how we’re talking about like AI and chat GPT and how my son-in-law was saying, like, I’m always really nice to chat GPT because when it takes over the world, I wanted to remember I was one of the good guys. Right. Like, and I was like, yeah, there’s, you know, there’s this20:15 I think people can have fun with it, right? People like, I mean, I remember when I was planning my trip and I was like, hey, this is what I’m thinking about doing. Can you give me some suggestions of places to go? Here’s a little bit about myself, right? And I kind of gave like my little personality thing and it came back with, wow, aren’t you a fun and exciting person? And you’re like, I am, you know? But I think that part of it actually really adds to the value. Like I think people for the most part like those little quirky20:43 things that you can get out of it. so I think making it more personable is like a huge value add, right? Even though it’s kind of silly, but I do think people enjoy that.21:11 It contains both video and text based tutorials that go over the entire process of finding products to sell all the way to getting your first sales online. Now this course is free and can be obtained at mywifequitterjob.com slash free. Just sign up right there on the front page via email and I’ll send you the course right away. Once again, that’s mywifequitterjob.com slash free. Now back to the show.21:37 So I’m logging every question, every answer, and then who asked it. Just so I can see what’s going on. Because one thing I didn’t want to do is hallucinate, right? Yes. Yes. So I’m very strict. And we’ll see how well that works. Like, if you ask it a question that isn’t covered in the transcript, it will say, I don’t know the answer to that question, instead of just making something up. Right. Right. Yeah. So is Christina going to get the award?22:04 for the most questions she gets. I have no idea, but it will be. Shout out to Christina. Just for fun, like I was abusing Steve Bot, like you stuck. You got to be in high school. You were only second chair on the clarinet. to see what it would say. So so far it’s it’s working. But you know, the true test will be. Oh, here, this is the other interesting part. So I’m logging all the questions.22:31 So I know what to cover going forward. I never really had this real-time feedback before. Yeah. Yeah. So my thought was similar to what you’re talking about as far as how to make this work on a bigger scale. I I think if it was just for the course, it would be worth it. Right? I think it’s such a value add to the course that even if that was where it ended, it’s something worth doing. However, if you’re going to go to the trouble of building it, why not figure out a way to monetize it in a bigger way?23:01 And so to me, the value definitely is giving people some sort of access to that, right? Because I think one of the reasons why people do buy the courses is because it gives them the access, right? Now with the Stevebot, they’re not getting the same type of access, right? But they are getting a lot of information that realistically, if you wanted to go find all that out, it would take you a good amount of time, right? And you might not know, like I still like,23:30 get information back from AI and I’m like, is that really true? Is that actually what, because I was actually when I was looking for the transcript stuff, it gave me six suggestions, but one of them was wrong. And obviously I double checked those things. So I think for people to know, hey, I can ask these questions to Steve, but I know the answers are all generated by something Steve said. So I do think that’s a really nice $7 a month.24:00 you know, value add. I think if you could get your YouTube videos included in that, that would be… the YouTube videos are always less detailed versions, much less detailed versions, the lessons, right? Yes. But I think, mean, to me, it’s like, OK, how do you leverage this with YouTube? Because you have so many subscribers, right? You’ve got a huge channel.24:24 You know, I don’t even know, like YouTube offers all those subscription models, right? And like, to me, it’s always like kind of foggy what you get when you pay for a subscription with YouTube. You when you read like what people offer most time, you’re like, eh, is that really offering anything? But like to me, if you could figure out some way, because I do think, I do think that would be nice because now you’ve got, I don’t even know how many videos, several hundred, right?24:48 It’s a ton. Yeah, I was shocked by how many there were in there. You’ve got five years of weekly video content, right? So, yeah, I mean, to me and I’m a math there. You do public math. OK, go on. Five times five, whatever that is. but yeah, I think to me, if you could figure out a way to leverage that, I think about Kellen right in our class that has the huge Pokemon channel.25:15 You know, and he’s always trying to figure out ways to monetize the channel outside of just the ad revenue and brand deals and things like that. Like somehow getting people because I think like for his stuff, because I know he’s teaching people, I believe, to play a game or showing people like game strategies or something like that. I’m not a Pokemon person, so I it’s like watching something in another language to me. But like being for people to be able to like type something in and being able to get directed to like this video.25:43 will give you that, to me that seems like really, it’s like a directory, right? But with instant answers and everything you need. I think I was going to keep them separate for now, like the class lessons bot, maybe a YouTube one. I might combine the blog post one with the, the problem is there’s some blog posts that are out of date because I haven’t been updating it. regardless, there’s a lot of potential there.26:10 What I was also thinking, and I brought this up to Jen, she did not like it at all. I was going to do this for Bumblebee for product recommendations. Just feed in all the products, all the descriptions, all the policies, and then just have this bot here, like a product recommendations bot. I’m curious as to what, because I know her pretty well, to me that doesn’t seem, that actually seems like a pretty good idea without26:39 Invasion of privacy. Well the problem and we didn’t even have a talk about this because you just got the axe I just got yeah, I just got the axe You know, what’s funny is I always put it on a priority and then she always just gives my ideas an axe Like right off the bat. It’s like the first reaction. I Think if customers like I think you just have to make it obvious that this is a bot. Oh That people would think they weren’t we’re talking to a real person, right?27:08 Like this is a bot. It’s only here to help you find the product that you’re looking for. That’s it Yeah, okay, and I answer common questions like delivery and whatnot. Yeah, I do get that side of things for sure Yeah, and then you also have to worry more about it hallucinating Right. Yeah, so let’s say it says oh no shipping’s free always free, you know, it makes up something like that. Yeah27:37 then that’s a problem too. Yeah. Okay, I definitely see that if there’s a way that you can avoid those pitfalls, that seems like a genius idea because I’ve been talking to one of my clients actually all week about how do we get people to buy either more things in their order, making, and we have like one click upsell and we have other things on the site that make recommendations, but like where people could actually type it in, right? Like I just did this.28:06 I did this, what should I do next? Because we have, we know what it is, we know what people should do next, right? But I do see what you’re saying where, I mean we had that issue happen several years ago where it wasn’t, it was actually with our texting service where basically people could text in something and then they got a free shipping code. Well, the texting service only,28:32 it didn’t allow you to segregate your free shipping. So like you only got the basic free, like if you wanted basic parcel post, whatever, that was free, but like nothing else would, you couldn’t get overnight free, right? Like no one gives away overnight free shipping, but the SMS service didn’t have the ability to distinguish the two. So when it went out, you could get any kind of shipping, international, whatever. And it took us like 14 hours to realize that people were getting like $50 shipping for free.29:02 Right, because they’re overnighting stuff to themselves. So I can see like a bot doing something similar where it’s like, shipping’s always free or, you know, buy one, get six free monograms. You know what I mean? Like I can see that. So don’t get me wrong. This is going to be implemented. Yes. You just have to figure out how to avoid that. Well, no, no, no, I’m going to do it. But I’m going to start by replacing the search bar with this. OK. Right. Because my search bar is something I actually wrote years ago and it works kind of well.29:31 It presents the products in the search based on, obviously, keywords, but also what was bought along with it in the category. But this AI one would be way better. And then the goal is, this is all in my head for Bumblebee. I have to go through all the products again, and there’s almost 1,000 now. I was going say you have lot of products.30:01 The key is figuring out what occasion each of those products are ideal for. So I’m gonna go through and I have AI generate all the possible occasions that a handkerchief that particular style would be good for. And it’s not obvious. Like some of these handkerchiefs, and I just wrote a little routine to do this. There was this red handkerchief that had something on it or whatever. And it suggested some real esoteric, well, not esoteric, but.30:28 Say Tana, is that what you’re looking No, no, no. you’re like a bird lover or for bird, stuff like random things that you probably wouldn’t have thought of, right? Yes. Or this red one would be perfect for Valentine’s Day because of something obscure in the embroidery. I wish I had examples ready to go, but find out all the possible use cases for a particular style of handkerchief.30:57 feed that all in, and so when someone asks, hey, I need something for a baptism or something, it automatically pops up all of them. Bright red. Not for a baptism. Don’t do that. Okay, so here’s That’s an easier project, actually, because it’s all text. Here’s the bigger question. You’re doing this all yourself. Most of the people who listen cannot do it all by themselves.31:26 Is this something that you think people could one figure out how to do with, you know, maybe some research and like how much technical knowledge do you truly need to have to do this? Or do you have to pay somebody or is that is it going to be you have to pay someone to set it up or you’re going to end up using a subscription tool that’s going to cost you? I think for most people you can’t set this up. Like I literally you should see my chat to be T thread learning this stuff.31:55 I literally spent probably six hours straight just reading all this stuff just because I was interested. Like I asking little questions which actually brought me up to the way we teach stuff in schools is all messed up, right? I was just thinking to myself as I was doing this, I remember when I was in school, and this is completely random, I remember I was in school, I was afraid to ask questions sometimes to the professor because I thought I’d come across as dumb.32:24 Or like if I asked a friend how to do this, I might be afraid to ask certain dumb questions that showed my friend that I was dumb. But with ChatGBT, I was asking all the dumb questions and it was giving me answers. So I actually ended up learning things a lot more thoroughly. And so I was going to the real nitty gritty. Like how does this technology even work? Like what’s the math behind it? All little questions like that. And so that’s why it took me a long time.32:54 If someone were to just try to plug and chug this, I still think it’d be pretty overwhelming. I was actually considering offering this as a Shopify plugin, because it’s actually useful, right? It reads all of your descriptions and it’s like a recommendation engine. I’m sure something like that already exists, to be honest with you. Probably, yeah. But this one would be like dirt cheap, I think. Yeah. And I probably wouldn’t, maybe I would just do for the class. don’t know.33:23 If you were to have to pay for it, what do you think it’s worth? Not like to price something, but like if someone’s like, hey, I think I would really like to use this in my business. There are some services. Like what do you think the value is of this? Because most people aren’t going to be able to do it on their own. Well, I will tell you that a friend of mine offered a service like this two years ago and she was ahead of her time. Yeah. But she was charging $500 a month. Wow. OK. So expensive. Yeah.33:53 But realistically, once it’s all set up, it’s like pennies to run. So really the hard part is the setup and the maintenance. How do you retrain it again with new things that you have? But in terms of the value, I don’t want to jump too far ahead because I haven’t tested it enough. But I think if it even works 75%, it’ll be a huge value to the course. No question. Yeah.34:23 Even at five, let’s just say $500 a month. Let’s just say if you’re cutting down on customer service time and you’re cutting down on your time, you know what I mean? If you’re increasing your average order value, let’s just say in your store, because everyone’s adding an additional product to the cart, it doesn’t take very much for it to pay for itself. Yeah. Like if I were to productize this, you have to make sure that you track all the incremental revenue from the service, right? Correct. Yeah.34:51 and then show the customer that it’s worth it. Like I said, I’m sure all this has been implemented by somebody already. No question. But they probably want a couple hundred bucks a month for it. When in fact, the code is not that hard. I mean, actually I think about this for any app in the Shopify App Store. Most of the code in the App Store is not hard.35:15 Yes. Which is why I think the Shopify App Store will probably have problems in the next couple years as more and more people don’t need code. Like everything I had to write for this AI was written in Python, which is a language that I did not know at all. I did not know a lick of it, but all programming languages all kind of blend together after a while if you’ve been doing it long enough. And so I could get through it with the help of AI without knowing how to write it at all. And so I suspect that’ll get better in a couple of years to the point where anyone35:45 we’ll be able to tell it what it wants and then debug it and make their own stuff.35:53 I mean, I think it’s pretty exciting. I mean, I was giddy. My wife, like I told her what I’ve been working on, she’s like, oh, great.36:03 I think literally nothing else for the course members, it’s awesome. It’s going to cut down on their time, it cuts down on your time. Then if you can leverage it further and earn some additional revenue from it, I think that’s really valuable too. Yes, we’ll just have to see how it goes. Yes, see how good of a job it does.36:28 See how good of a job it does, yeah. I mean, for the first two or three videos that I did and I was just asking questions about it, it knew, I mean, it has the entire transcript, but I would ask it stuff that wasn’t covered, and it would give a pretty good answer around it, and then it’d provide the link, which is the important part to the actual lesson. Yeah. So, okay, I guess my last question would be if…36:55 So let’s just say Steve says, I don’t know the answer. We don’t have content on that, right? Like whatever. Then what happens to people? Do they get funneled into like an email form or is it just like this is dead? Is this for the class you mean? Yeah, let’s just say for the class. For the class, I’m logging all the questions. And then what I’m going to do is I’m going to do a search for anyone who got an I don’t know the answer to that question. And then I’m going to see how many times that form of question was asked and then I’ll make a lesson on37:25 You didn’t know I get that part. I’m saying like, so let’s just say I’m in. Well, I am in the course, but I log on. I want to know something, you know, can I link my Amazon and TikTok shop? Something like that, right? Like it may be surprising that you haven’t covered. you know, and it says, hey, that’s a great question. You’re such a fantastic student. A plus, you know, all the compliments. And then it says, says, I don’t have the answer for you. What what next happens in that chat? Does it say right now? Nothing. Yeah, but what is going to?37:55 Because then do they have to go back and now email support or is there a click to a form? What’s the next step? The next step would be just email support. It’d be cool if you could integrate a little click here to email. You know what I mean? Just get that integrated too. It’d be easy. Yeah, that part is easy. Just email and then the email address, right? Yeah. No, I’m saying that’s super simple, but just that little feature would be a great.38:22 Because I can’t stand when it’s like email support and then they just put the email there and then you have to copy and paste it especially if you’re on your phone. Oh you want to click I want to click and it opens everything which that every a lot of people do that for other things so it could be done in this too.38:37 I’ve actually never done that, but how does it know which email client to open up? I don’t know. It always opens up the default one on my computer, so I don’t know how it knows. Oh, I see. So if you click, it’ll open up Gmail, for example? Well, on my desktop, it opens up the Mac Mail because I’ve never uninstalled it. But when I don’t have it on my phone, it opens up Gmail. I see. Send me an example of that. I’d love to see it. I’m sure it’s like a line. Yeah, I was going to say, this doesn’t seem like a very complicated but I39:07 What I can’t see is when they just give you the email and then especially if you’re on a mobile device, you’ve got to copy that, open up your mail app. I mean, the easiest way is to just have a little box where you just type in the question right there and you hit submit. Yeah, that would be that’s easy. That’s easy to do instead of opening up an email client. Yes. Add that to your priority list. OK, I will write that down. That’s probably a good suggestion. Yeah.39:31 I am very curious to how people are going to treat Steve Bot though. Are they going to be rude? Are they going be polite? Are you going to track that? Who’s a bad tipper? Well, I’m obviously not going to manually track anything. I’m going to shove all that stuff in and then have it tell me what are the common questions and who’s asking the most questions. Then when someone logs on and they’re like, this is your 32nd question this week, Kathy. You need to take a break.40:01 It’ll cost one point per question. Yes. Oh, that’d be hilarious. Oh my gosh. Yeah. I think there’s a lot of uses for this. I think it’ll be interesting once you get it up and running. Um, I’m, I’m curious, like how often is it going to get stumped? Like, don’t know. Well, I mean, obviously I don’t cover every topic, right? Right. Right. So it should get stumped if you ask it anything that hasn’t been covered. Hopefully it won’t make anything up. That that’s my biggest worry actually.40:30 Yes, and someone sends you an angry email saying they have $130,000 of trinkets that they’ve ordered because Stevebot said, go for it. I’m sure someone’s going to ask, should I sell this item? I was going to say that’s probably going to be the top Stevebot. Then it’ll probably reference all the niche research ones and tell it, if it follows under these guidelines, that’s what I hope it’ll answer.41:00 Yeah. Okay. We’ll have to do a follow-up episode. everything’s, I mean, like I said, it’s still transcribing and generating like the files for the, to train the bot right now, but should be done by today. And I should be able to release this bot by tomorrow at a bare minimum, I think. So yeah, I can’t wait.41:20 Hope you enjoyed this episode. At some point, I’ll release part of this bot to my Discord community, so stay tuned. For more information and resources, go to mywifequithejob.com slash episode 598.

Today we’re gonna talk about a couple projects that I’ve been working on and I was a little hesitant to talk about this because I hope it doesn’t bore you guys. Tony says it’ll be interesting. Well, we’ll see.  It’s just a selfish reason.  I wanna know about SteveBot. My first concern is do we need another Steve? Okay, wait, we didn’t even tell people what I’m working on. It’s called SteveBot. It’s SteveBot. Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e01:08\u003cbr/\u003e And I have to say that I’ve learned more in the last two days than I have in probably like the last year. This is completely new to me. How all this stuff works and everything. But I did create Steve bot. I did this for the course because I kept getting questions that were already covered in the videos in the, the class. But since there’s like 450 videos, I get it right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e01:37\u003cbr/\u003e you probably didn’t watch the one that yielded the answer. Right. And this is a common problem that, that I’ve been having actually in the last few years with the class, probably the last two or three years. Yeah. When the volume of videos, even though I’m pruning them, I’m also constantly adding new ones every single week. Yeah. And the level of information is,  is overwhelming for a lot of people. Cause so I always say upfront,  you shouldn’t watch everything. Yeah. Just watch what you’re actively implementing anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e02:07\u003cbr/\u003e You know, I’ve just to speak on that for a minute. I think that’s the case for both courses because I know that we have been on lives and doing, you know, office hours and things like that. And someone will ask a question. And I know we’ve done a lesson on it, right? Because I know that I did gave the lesson or we did it together, whatever.  But, you know, I can’t remember which lesson it’s in because a lot of times, too, I think for the courses, we get so granular in the information. like the lesson is really specific on one thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e02:37\u003cbr/\u003e It’s like, well then is it in that one or is it in this one? Because they’re both talking about, let’s just say lead magnet and  welcome flows, right? So which one, so I actually think this is gonna be good because personally for me, like I need it just to keep up with everything that we’re doing. Yeah, so that was the goal.  And then I had to run down this whole rabbit hole of implementation, learning how to train AI models and all that stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e03:06\u003cbr/\u003e It is so fascinating. But at the same time, once you get down to like the nitty gritty,  it’s actually very basic what it does.  okay, so the overall goal was so that instead of asking, hey, you what lesson is this in or whatever, you just ask Steve Bot,  and then it gives you the answer to that question. And then it gives you a link to the video that covered it. Okay. Right. And so,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e03:34\u003cbr/\u003e If the answer didn’t answer it thoroughly, you go and you watch the video. Right. That sounds fantastic.  So it’s like a much better version of search. Uh, in practice  doing that is a little bit more difficult  because you can’t literally, you can’t just shove all of your stuff into AI.  kind of doesn’t work that way. So  the limitations are, so there’s, um, like I said, there’s like 450 ish videos  and the first tall task actually.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e04:02\u003cbr/\u003e was automating, generating transcripts from all the videos. So the first thing I did is I downloaded all of the videos into a directory, just the ones that are active, because believe it not, there’s like close to 800 videos, I think. I mean, I believe it. The course is what? 13, 14 years old at this point? is 14 years old. Yeah. Right? So I had all these videos in there that were taken down, right? Cause they’re obsolete or whatever. Right. But they’re still, so I had to find the ones that were active.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e04:32\u003cbr/\u003e which meant  writing some WordPress routines to just grab the active posts. That wasn’t that hard.  And then downloading them to a directory. Then you need to grab transcripts of all of them, right?  And  this is where I went a little cheap.  So the transcripts, you can feed them into OpenAI and get them done. But OpenAI actually open sourced a model for free and it’s called Whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e05:02\u003cbr/\u003e You can run all that locally on your machine if you have a good video card.  Actually, it’s still running right now. I was hoping to launch SteveVot today.  It’s only at video 300 right now,  and it’s at the rate of three minutes per video.  When you think about it, that’s really fast. Yes, it’s fast. If I didn’t skimp on my video card, it probably would have been done overnight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e05:30\u003cbr/\u003e But I don’t play games. I didn’t really have a use for a video, a good video card until.  You needed Kevin for this. Where’s Kevin? I did. I’m sure Kevin has a really nice video card. So just I want to ask a question about this. It’s slightly unrelated, but so I don’t know if you know this, but if you have videos on Facebook that were live, so anything to any time you go live on Facebook, right? Facebook has said that they’re taking those down now, like after 30 days. Yeah.  So  what we have done is downloaded all those\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e05:59\u003cbr/\u003e videos that we wanna keep, right? Because some of them are good, right? And like for us, we don’t do a ton on Facebook Live, so it wouldn’t be like as important to what  you and I do, but like for Happy Housewife, I did a lot of live recipes, I’ve done a lot of live tips, you there’s a lot of content. I think about someone like  Laurie from Passionate Pennypinscher, who  has tons of live content on Facebook. So step one was download it all, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e06:25\u003cbr/\u003e But now we want to be able to possibly like re-record those, right, on YouTube and stuff like that. So my issue is the transcript side, right? Because they’re not already on YouTube, right? Now they’re in my drive. So what’s the best? That’s the easy part. Is it? So what’s the best method to get the transcripts? Because like I tried ChatGPT, that was an absolute bust.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e06:49\u003cbr/\u003e Whoa, why? Oh, yeah, you can’t you can’t just feed it in chat. Yeah, and it’s like it’ll do it in 30 second increments. And I was like, this is not going to work. Yeah. The way you do it is you can probably use make doc. Like if you don’t want to code, I assume you want to code. No, I’m not. And you’re willing to money, right? Yes, but like not a ton of money, right? So I started researching. Yeah. So what I was thinking, though, this is going to happen to a lot of people, right? A lot of people have videos that they need to probably get now because of Facebook’s new policy. What do we do?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e07:19\u003cbr/\u003e By the way, is this only for live videos? can’t remember. It’s just for live videos. videos. That’s what they’ve said so far. you know. Okay. So  what you do is you can use make.com. Okay. Throw all your videos in Dropbox and then create an automation that feeds it into the OpenAI Whisper model. And if you guys are listening to this, you have no idea what I’m talking about. Make.com is like a  workflow type of tool.  Okay.  The hardest part about creating any app is making things talk to each other, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e07:47\u003cbr/\u003e So essentially you need to make Dropbox talk to  OpenAI.  That’s exactly what this does.  You drop down a Dropbox widget. It feeds the files over to OpenAI, the whisper model.  It’s super cheap. It’s like 0.00001 cents per token, which works out to be, I don’t know, like 50 cents maybe for a… So you have to use the token model. Gotcha. Yeah.  Anyway, and then you just have it drop those transcripts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e08:17\u003cbr/\u003e transcriptions into Dropbox again in a different folder. Okay, that’s a good tip. So just talking about the transcript side of things because  I looked and I started doing some research and you know, you can there’s a lot of services are really expensive or okay. Wait, if you want the free model, that’s even easier than that. Okay, Riverside FM offers a free transcription service. Interesting. You just have to drag it over manually though. Yeah. So when I when I asked Chad GPT, you know, how can I do this for free?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e08:46\u003cbr/\u003e Their top tip which I actually you know This is something where I think if you have an overseas VA or something like that This would be probably worth doing is basically upload them all to YouTube and have YouTube do the transcripts privately This is way better than that. Yeah, I don’t know your idea sounds way better. I’m saying that’s what they gave me Oh, no, no, no, I meant the free riverside method. Yeah, that’s what I’m saying. That sounds better than Because obviously you don’t want them public on YouTube. So I mean how many videos are we talking about here?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e09:15\u003cbr/\u003e I don’t think,  Happy Housewife probably only has, it has under 50.  Oh, okay. Then just do the hand drag method. Yeah. One of my clients though, I think we have over a hundred.  Okay.  hundred even is also borderline hand drag. Yeah, cause you’ve got thousands that you’re dealing with. Oh, and it’s not even, if this goes well, I might do this with a podcast and every blog post on my So that people can find something quickly if they have a question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e09:42\u003cbr/\u003e Yeah, because sometimes there’s something in the class  that was covered actually in a blog post, but I didn’t do like a whole video on it. Right. Right.  I feel like that happens actually a lot, especially when we do our webinars, people ask a question  and  usually the answer can be found in one of the blog posts that you have. Correct. YouTube at this point. Now it’s YouTube for you. Really. I was debating whether to  to  include my blog post in it because Google has kind of already done that for me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e10:11\u003cbr/\u003e You know what I mean? It’s already been read.  The YouTube videos is also another  avenue. I don’t know.  I just want to get the course videos here first. The goal also was to consider just charging  for the bot. I don’t know. Charge for people to be able to use the bot. Correct. But not people in the course. No, obviously not people in the class. Just like a…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e10:39\u003cbr/\u003e It’s like a stepping stone into joining the full class, so to speak. Got you. You did the next step, got the transcripts. You get the transcripts. Here’s what’s-\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e10:49\u003cbr/\u003e Here’s what like confounded me about the whole process.  I was under the impression that you could just throw it all into OpenAI and it just magically trains it. Right? That’s what we’re led to believe. Yes. I I believe I’m a believer. There’s a couple of limitations though.  One, you can only feed in so many, so much information at one time. Yes. Cause all these models have context windows, right?  And so what you have to do is you have to break up\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e11:19\u003cbr/\u003e each of these transcripts into blocks.  Individual transcripts have to be broken up as well. Yes, think about it. If you have a 20-minute video, the  context window might be like a thousand words.  I don’t know the exact limit site. I  just ask you GPT for what a good block size was.  A good block size is 500. I  don’t know where that got that from, but basically you need to break these into chunks.  If you can,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e11:49\u003cbr/\u003e you  summarize each of those chunks  and you tag them.  think about like a video, let’s say we do a podcast. We talk about a lot of different stuff on this podcast, right? Yes, we do. So you can’t just shove it all in. And since we skip topics all the time, a podcast ironically is probably the hardest thing to train the AI for.  So what you need to do is ideally you give it, you break it into chunks that are all about one topic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e12:16\u003cbr/\u003e and then you name the topic and whatnot, and then you feed it in that way. Now, ironically, and this gets really, you can actually use AI to pre-process the transcript into these chunks before you train the AI itself. Okay, because that was my next question. Yeah. I didn’t have time to do a really thorough job of that in the first iteration, but the way my videos are laid out in the class, it’s already,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e12:44\u003cbr/\u003e pretty good, right? I only cover a very specific topic  and I cover it for 10 to 15 minutes and then I move on. So  in itself, each of my lessons are already kind of pretty good to go.  Whereas with a podcast, especially if it’s with you or any guests, we talk about like 10 topics. Sometimes we skip all over the place. That’s harder. Okay, so.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e13:10\u003cbr/\u003e My next question is, you’re  doing this in reverse right now, right? All the content’s already been created. Moving forward, as you create, you’re giving a lesson today on Stevebot, right? In  That’s not the lesson, actually. I have to work on the lesson right after  this. I’m going to introduce Stevebot if  it’s ready. Hypothetically, you’re giving a Stevebot lesson today in the course.  Moving forward, is there another way to do it so that you’re not doing all these sort of\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e13:38\u003cbr/\u003e Because right now you’re going back and getting all the stuff that’s already happened. Moving forward, is there a way to do it where you don’t have to, you can skip some of these steps? No, you always have to do these steps. What do you mean? I don’t understand. So like right now you had to take all your videos, download them, get them and drop. You had this whole process, right? To get the transcript, to divide the transcript up. But like today, as you give the lesson,  is there any way to do it as you’re giving it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e14:07\u003cbr/\u003e Oh, as I’m giving the lesson. So yeah, like pre and I guess not pre because there’s nothing pre done about it. But like, you know, so you’re maybe skipping being able to skip some steps.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e14:18\u003cbr/\u003e No, I mean all the steps are gonna be there. And in fact, what’s unfortunate about Stevebot is like when a lesson comes on, I have to manually retrain the model again with the new lessons so that it knows how to answer stuff in that lesson.  So I’m probably only gonna update Stevebot like  once.  It doesn’t take very long to be fair. It literally takes,  I don’t know, probably 10 minutes.  It’s not all automated right now either, right? Because I’m just trying to get the thing up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e14:47\u003cbr/\u003e So there’s like several manual steps I’m doing. But yeah, once it becomes all automated,  in theory,  once the video is there, I just throw in a directory and it automatically updates Steve. I’m not there yet, obviously. Yeah, yeah. So when you say,  you give a lesson today on Stevebot, you have to train it, what does that entail? That’s what I was just talking about. You gotta break up the transcript into logical blocks. So that’s all that  is. There’s nothing else after that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e15:15\u003cbr/\u003e Yeah, I mean, so the more information and context you can give it, the better the training will be.  right now what I do is I give it a title,  like of that chunk, and then I tag it with the URL and then the title of the video so that if it ends up grabbing from that chunk, the URL is automatically embedded and it tells you which video it’s part of. And then it gives you a little mini title. So that Cbot will send  people to the correct.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e15:43\u003cbr/\u003e location to get the rest of the information. Correct. Correct.  I’ve only tested this on like three lessons so far and so far it’s pretty good because I got to upload the rest. mean, it takes time to run all this stuff, right? Yeah. Yeah. Like through AI. So here’s where it’s like so simple and kind of brain dead. The way it works  is and I kept asking you, is this really the best practice that everyone’s using? And they’re like, yep, this is, this is what all these companies are doing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e16:13\u003cbr/\u003e What’s dumb about this whole thing  is you ask it a question.  Here’s how it works. And I’ll try to keep it as  simple as possible. You ask it a question. OpenAI turns that question into math. Okay. Right? A vector or whatever. And then what happens behind the scenes is it takes that math vector and it compares it to all the little chunks that you’ve broken up.  Right? For similarity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e16:41\u003cbr/\u003e Right? Whether basically whether that chunk will answer that question. And then it returns a bunch of chunks. And then based on the chunks that are returned, AKA parts of the transcript,  that gets only that little chunk of 500 words gets fed into AI to summarize the answer. Interesting. It’s not like AI knows all of your stuff and you’re loading up everything. Right. You’re doing most of the work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e17:10\u003cbr/\u003e and feeding AI only the portion that you believe answers the question. Okay. So how do you see this  as  a  obviously,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e17:23\u003cbr/\u003e Obviously for your students, this is a huge value add. Yes. Right. This is  I feel like this is going to be such a game changer for the course, because I remember when I first met you and you had had the course, I don’t know, maybe four years. Right. But you already had several hundred lessons in the course. Yeah. It was really it wasn’t well organized because you had asked me like, I’d like some feedback. And I was like, I can’t find anything.  Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e17:46\u003cbr/\u003e And  then you did a really good job of rearranging everything.  when you get started, start here. If you’re here, go here. You took people on a trail.  So to me, the value add for the students, phenomenal.  The ease of getting information. I think this on the flip side for you,  the cut down on customer service,  answering questions that are available for people to find on their own is the other benefit, the cross benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e18:17\u003cbr/\u003e If you don’t have a course, right? Like how do you see this benefiting you outside of the course? I haven’t even thought that far ahead, Tony.  I’ve been head down trying to learn all this stuff. There’s a lot of technical pieces involved. Oh, I’m sure. Yeah.  But going forward, I was going to do a trial. Here’s what I was thinking. Like I’m going to build a community in the end, right? Yes. I mean, I have ideas for you. That’s why I’m asking. want to see where you are. do. OK, so I’ll tell you mine. I want to hear yours. OK, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e18:46\u003cbr/\u003e I want to build a much bigger community that obviously goes beyond the course. The course members will always be the top priority. But a tripwire, so to speak, would maybe be to give them access where they can ask questions to Steve Bot for something ridiculously cheap, like $5 a month or something like that. I don’t know. That doesn’t include any of live portions. I think the live office hours and the live Zooms are always going to be the value add in the Discord group. And then once they’re in the Bot, if they like,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e19:16\u003cbr/\u003e the questions and whatnot, then they can consider joining the full class.  Plus, this makes great content.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  But as far as after that,  I’m going to do it for profitable audience.  And that, in theory, should be faster because I know what I’m doing now.  And there’s a lot less content in there.  There’s only a couple hundred lessons. And then maybe I’ll make a Tony bot where the bot responds and like…  With hugs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e19:46\u003cbr/\u003e I haven’t even done the fun stuff yet. I can make it like  reply as me and use Steve-isms,  you know what saying? Yes. See, I think that’s really fun. I mean,  this is dumb. We were talking about this  with some friends last night about how we’re talking about like AI and chat GPT and how my son-in-law was saying, like, I’m always really nice to chat GPT because when it takes over the world, I wanted to remember I was one of the good guys. Right. Like,  and  I was like, yeah, there’s, you know, there’s this\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e20:15\u003cbr/\u003e I think people can have fun with it, right? People like,  I mean, I remember when I was planning my trip and I was like, hey, this is what I’m thinking about doing. Can you give me some suggestions of places to go? Here’s a little bit about myself, right? And I kind of gave like my little personality thing and it came back with, wow, aren’t you a fun and exciting person? And you’re like, I  am, you know?  But I think that part of it actually really adds to the value. Like I think people for the most part like those little quirky\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e20:43\u003cbr/\u003e things that you can get out of it. so I think making it more personable is like a huge value add, right? Even though it’s kind of silly, but I do think people enjoy that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e21:11\u003cbr/\u003e It contains both video and text based tutorials that go over the entire process of finding products to sell all the way to getting your first sales online. Now this course is free and can be obtained at mywifequitterjob.com slash free. Just sign up right there on the front page via email and I’ll send you the course right away. Once again, that’s mywifequitterjob.com slash free. Now back to the show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e21:37\u003cbr/\u003e So I’m logging every question, every answer, and then who asked it.  Just so I can see what’s going on. Because one thing I didn’t want to do is hallucinate, right? Yes. Yes. So I’m very strict. And we’ll see how well that works. Like, if you ask it a question that isn’t covered in the transcript, it will say, I don’t know the answer to that question,  instead of just making something up. Right. Right. Yeah. So is Christina going to get the award?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e22:04\u003cbr/\u003e for the most questions she gets. I have no idea, but it will be. Shout out to Christina.  Just for fun, like I was abusing Steve Bot, like  you stuck. You got to be in high school.  You were only second chair on the clarinet.  to see what it would  say. So so far it’s it’s working. But you know, the true test will be.  Oh, here, this is the other interesting part. So I’m logging all the questions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e22:31\u003cbr/\u003e So I know what to cover going forward. I never really had this real-time feedback before.  Yeah. Yeah. So my thought was similar to what you’re talking about as far as how to make this work on a bigger scale. I I think if it was just for the course, it would be worth it. Right? I think it’s such a value add to the course that even if that was where it ended, it’s something worth doing. However,  if you’re going to go to the trouble of building it, why not figure out a way to monetize it in a bigger way?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e23:01\u003cbr/\u003e And so to me, the value definitely is giving people some sort of access to that, right? Because I think  one of the reasons why people do buy the courses is because it gives them the access, right? Now with the Stevebot, they’re not getting the same type of access, right? But they are getting a lot of information that realistically, if you wanted to go find all that out, it would take you a good amount of time, right? And you might not know,  like I still like,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e23:30\u003cbr/\u003e get information back from AI and I’m like, is that really true?  Is that actually  what, because I was actually when I was looking for the transcript stuff,  it gave me  six suggestions, but one of them was wrong.  And obviously I double checked those things. So I think for people to know, hey, I can ask these  questions to Steve, but I know the answers are all generated by something Steve said.  So I do think that’s a  really nice $7 a month.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e24:00\u003cbr/\u003e you know, value add. I think if you could get your YouTube videos included in that, that would be… the YouTube videos are always less detailed versions, much less detailed versions, the lessons, right? Yes. But I think, mean, to me, it’s like, OK, how do you leverage this with YouTube? Because you have so many subscribers, right? You’ve got a huge channel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e24:24\u003cbr/\u003e You know, I don’t even know, like YouTube offers all those subscription models, right? And like, to me, it’s always like kind of foggy what you get when you pay for a subscription with YouTube. You when you read like what people offer most time, you’re like, eh, is that really offering anything?  But like to me, if you could figure out some way, because I do think,  I do think that would be nice because now you’ve got, I don’t even know how many videos, several hundred, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e24:48\u003cbr/\u003e It’s a ton. Yeah, I was shocked by how many there were in there. You’ve got five years of weekly video content, right? So, yeah, I mean, to me and I’m a math there. You do public math. OK, go on.  Five times five, whatever that is. but yeah, I think to me, if you could figure out a way to leverage that,  I think about Kellen right in our class that has the huge Pokemon channel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e25:15\u003cbr/\u003e You know, and he’s always trying to figure out ways to monetize the channel outside of just the ad revenue and  brand deals and things like that. Like somehow getting people because I think like for his stuff, because I know he’s teaching people, I believe, to play a game or showing people like game strategies or something like that.  I’m not a Pokemon person, so I  it’s like watching  something in another language to me.  But like being for people to be able to like type something in and being able to get directed to like this video.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e25:43\u003cbr/\u003e will give you that, to me that seems like really, it’s like a directory, right? But with instant answers and everything you need. I think I was going to keep them separate for now, like the class lessons bot, maybe a YouTube one. I might combine the blog post one with the, the problem is there’s some blog posts that are out of date because I haven’t been updating it.  regardless, there’s a lot of potential there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e26:10\u003cbr/\u003e What I was also thinking, and I brought this up to Jen, she did not like it at all.  I was going to do this for Bumblebee for product recommendations. Just feed in all the products, all the descriptions, all the policies,  and then just have this  bot here, like a product recommendations bot. I’m curious as to what, because I know her pretty well,  to me that doesn’t seem, that actually seems like a pretty good idea without\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e26:39\u003cbr/\u003e Invasion of privacy. Well the problem and we didn’t even have a talk about this because you just got the axe  I just got yeah, I just got the axe You  know, what’s funny is I always put it on a priority and then she always just gives my ideas an axe  Like right off the bat.  It’s like the first reaction.  I Think if customers like I think you just have to make it obvious that this is a bot.  Oh That people would think they weren’t we’re talking to a real person, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e27:08\u003cbr/\u003e Like this is a bot. It’s only here to help you find the product that you’re looking for. That’s it Yeah, okay, and I answer common questions like delivery and whatnot. Yeah, I do get that side of things for sure Yeah, and then you also have to worry more about it hallucinating Right. Yeah, so let’s say it says oh no shipping’s free always free, you know, it makes up something like that. Yeah\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e27:37\u003cbr/\u003e then that’s a problem too. Yeah. Okay, I definitely see that if there’s a way that you can avoid those pitfalls, that seems like a genius idea because  I’ve been talking to one of my clients actually all week about  how do we get people to buy either more things in their order, making, and we have like one click upsell and we have other things on the site that make recommendations, but like where people could actually type it in, right? Like I just did this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e28:06\u003cbr/\u003e I did this, what should I do next? Because we have, we know what it is, we know what people should do next, right? But I do see what you’re saying where,  I mean we had that issue happen  several years ago where it wasn’t,  it was actually with our texting service where basically people could text in something and then they got a free shipping code. Well, the texting service only,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e28:32\u003cbr/\u003e it didn’t allow you to segregate your free shipping. So like you only got the basic free, like if you wanted basic parcel post, whatever, that was free, but like nothing else would, you couldn’t get overnight free, right? Like no one gives away overnight free shipping, but the SMS service didn’t have the ability to distinguish the two. So when it went out, you could get any kind of shipping, international, whatever. And it took us like 14 hours to realize that people were getting like $50 shipping for free.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e29:02\u003cbr/\u003e Right, because they’re overnighting stuff to themselves. So I can see like a bot doing something similar where it’s like, shipping’s always free or, you know, buy one, get six free monograms. You know what I mean? Like I can see that. So don’t get me wrong. This is going to be implemented. Yes. You just have to figure out how to avoid that. Well, no, no, no, I’m going to do it. But I’m going to start by replacing the search bar with this. OK. Right. Because my search bar is something I actually wrote years ago and it works kind of well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e29:31\u003cbr/\u003e It presents the products in the search based on, obviously, keywords, but also what was bought along with it in the category. But this AI one would be way better. And then the goal is, this is all in my head for Bumblebee. I have to go through all the products again, and there’s almost 1,000 now. I was going say you have lot of products.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e30:01\u003cbr/\u003e The key is figuring out what occasion each of those products are ideal for. So I’m gonna go through and I have AI generate all the possible occasions that a handkerchief that particular style would be good for.  And it’s not obvious. Like some of these handkerchiefs, and I just wrote a little routine to do this. There was this red handkerchief that had something on it or whatever. And it suggested some real  esoteric, well, not esoteric, but.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e30:28\u003cbr/\u003e Say Tana, is that what you’re looking No, no, no. you’re like a bird lover or for bird, stuff like random things that you probably wouldn’t have thought of, right? Yes.  Or this red one would be perfect for Valentine’s Day  because of something obscure in the embroidery.  I wish I had examples ready to go, but find out all the possible use cases for a particular style of handkerchief.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e30:57\u003cbr/\u003e feed that all in, and so when someone asks, hey, I need something for a baptism or something,  it automatically pops up  all of them. Bright red.  Not for a baptism. Don’t do that. Okay, so here’s That’s an easier project, actually, because it’s all text.  Here’s the bigger question. You’re doing this all yourself.  Most of the people who listen cannot do it all by themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e31:26\u003cbr/\u003e Is this something that you think people could one figure out how to do with, you know, maybe some research and  like how much technical knowledge do you truly need to have to do this? Or do you have to pay somebody  or is that is it going to be you have to pay someone to set it up or you’re going to end up using a subscription tool that’s going to cost you? I think for most people  you can’t set this up. Like I literally you should see my chat to be T thread learning this stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e31:55\u003cbr/\u003e I literally spent probably six hours straight just reading all this stuff just because I was interested. Like I asking little questions which actually brought me up to the way we teach stuff in schools is all messed up, right? I was just thinking to myself as I was doing this, I remember when I was in school, and this is completely random, I remember I was in school, I was afraid to ask questions sometimes to the professor because I thought I’d come across as dumb.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e32:24\u003cbr/\u003e Or like if I asked a friend how to do this,  I might be afraid to ask certain dumb questions that showed my friend that I was dumb.  But with ChatGBT, I was asking all the dumb questions and it was giving me answers. So I actually ended up learning things a lot more thoroughly.  And so I was going to the real nitty gritty. Like how does this technology even work? Like  what’s the math behind it?  All little questions like that. And so that’s why it took me a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e32:54\u003cbr/\u003e If someone were to just try to plug and chug this, I still think it’d be pretty overwhelming.  I was actually considering offering this as a Shopify plugin, because it’s actually useful, right? It reads all of your descriptions and it’s like a recommendation engine. I’m sure something like that already exists, to be honest with you. Probably, yeah. But this one would be like dirt cheap, I think. Yeah.  And I probably wouldn’t, maybe I would just do for the class. don’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e33:23\u003cbr/\u003e If you were to have to pay for it, what do you think it’s worth? Not like to price something, but like if someone’s like, hey, I think I would really like to use this in my business. There are some services. Like what do you think the value is of this? Because most people aren’t going to be able to do it on their own. Well, I will tell you that a friend of mine  offered a service like this two years ago and she was ahead of her time. Yeah. But she was charging $500 a month. Wow. OK. So expensive. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e33:53\u003cbr/\u003e But realistically,  once it’s all set up, it’s like pennies to run.  So really the hard part is the setup and the maintenance.  How do you retrain it again with new things that you have? But in terms of the value,  I don’t want to jump too far ahead because I haven’t tested it enough.  But I think if it even works 75%, it’ll be a huge value to the course. No question. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e34:23\u003cbr/\u003e Even at five, let’s just say $500 a month. Let’s just say  if you’re cutting down on customer service time and you’re cutting down on your time, you know what I mean? If you’re increasing your average order value, let’s just say in your store, because everyone’s adding an additional product to the cart, it doesn’t take very much for it to pay for itself. Yeah. Like if I were to productize this, you have to make sure that you track all the incremental revenue from the service, right? Correct. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e34:51\u003cbr/\u003e and then show the customer that it’s worth it.  Like I said, I’m sure all this has been implemented by somebody already.  No question. But they probably want a couple hundred bucks a month for it.  When in fact, the code is not that hard. I  mean, actually I think about this for any app in the Shopify App Store.  Most of the code in the App Store is not hard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e35:15\u003cbr/\u003e Yes. Which is why I think the Shopify App Store will probably have problems in the next couple years as more and more people don’t need code. Like everything I had to write for this AI was written in Python, which is a language that I did not know at all. I did not know a lick of it, but all programming languages all kind of blend together after a while if you’ve been doing it long enough. And so I could get through it with the help of AI without knowing how to write it at all. And so I suspect that’ll get better in a couple of years to the point where anyone\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e35:45\u003cbr/\u003e we’ll be able to tell it what it wants and then debug it and make their own stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e35:53\u003cbr/\u003e I mean, I think it’s pretty exciting. I mean, I was giddy. My wife, like I told her what I’ve been working on, she’s like, oh, great.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e36:03\u003cbr/\u003e I  think  literally nothing else for the course members, it’s awesome.  It’s going to cut down on their time, it cuts down on your time.  Then if you can leverage it further and earn some  additional revenue from it, I think that’s really valuable too. Yes, we’ll just have to see how it goes. Yes, see how good of a job it does.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e36:28\u003cbr/\u003e See how good of a job it does, yeah. I mean, for the first two or three videos that I did and I was just asking questions about it,  it knew, I mean, it has the entire transcript, but I would ask it stuff that wasn’t covered,  and it would give a pretty good answer around it, and then it’d provide the link, which is the important part to the actual lesson. Yeah. So, okay, I guess my last question would be  if…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e36:55\u003cbr/\u003e So let’s just say Steve says, I don’t know the answer. We don’t have content on that, right? Like whatever. Then what happens to people? Do they get funneled into like an email form or is it just like this is dead?  Is this for the class you mean? Yeah, let’s just say for the class. For the class, I’m logging all the questions.  And then what I’m going to do is I’m going to do a  search for anyone who got an I don’t know the answer to that question.  And then I’m going to see how many times that form of question was asked and then I’ll make a lesson on\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e37:25\u003cbr/\u003e You didn’t know I get that part. I’m saying like, so let’s just say I’m in. Well, I am in the course, but I log on. I want to know something, you know, can I link my Amazon and TikTok shop? Something like that, right? Like it may be surprising that you haven’t covered.  you know, and it says, hey, that’s a great question. You’re such a fantastic student. A plus, you know, all the compliments. And then it says, says, I don’t have the answer for you.  What what next happens in that chat? Does it say right now? Nothing. Yeah, but what is going to?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e37:55\u003cbr/\u003e Because then do they have to go back and now email support or is there a click to a form? What’s the next step? The next step would be just email support. It’d be cool if you could integrate a little click here to email. You know what I mean? Just get that integrated too. It’d be easy. Yeah, that part is easy. Just email and then the email address, right? Yeah. No, I’m saying that’s super simple, but just that little feature would be a great.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e38:22\u003cbr/\u003e Because I can’t stand when it’s like email support and then they just put the email there and then you have to copy and paste it especially if you’re on your phone. Oh you want to click  I want to click and it opens everything which that every a lot of people do that for other things so it could be done in this too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e38:37\u003cbr/\u003e I’ve actually never done that, but how does it know which email client to open up? I don’t know. It always opens up the default one on my computer, so I don’t know how it knows. Oh, I see. So if you click, it’ll open up Gmail, for example?  Well, on my desktop, it opens up the Mac Mail because I’ve never uninstalled it. But when I don’t have it on my phone, it opens up Gmail. I see. Send me an example of that. I’d love to see it. I’m sure it’s like a line.  Yeah, I was going to say, this doesn’t seem like a very complicated but I\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e39:07\u003cbr/\u003e What I can’t see is when they just give you the email and then especially if you’re on a mobile device, you’ve got to copy that, open up your mail app. I mean, the easiest way is to just have a little box where you just type in the question right there and you hit submit. Yeah, that would be that’s easy. That’s easy to do instead of opening up an email client. Yes. Add that to your priority list. OK, I will write that down.  That’s probably a good suggestion. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e39:31\u003cbr/\u003e I am very curious to how people are going to treat Steve Bot though. Are they going to be rude? Are they going be polite? Are you going to track that? Who’s a bad tipper? Well, I’m obviously not going to manually track anything. I’m going to shove all that stuff in and then have it tell me what are the common questions and who’s asking the most questions.  Then when someone logs on and they’re like, this is your  32nd question this week, Kathy.  You need to take a break.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e40:01\u003cbr/\u003e It’ll cost one point per question. Yes.  Oh, that’d be hilarious.  Oh my gosh. Yeah. I think there’s a lot of uses for this. I think it’ll be interesting once you get it up and running.  Um, I’m, I’m curious, like how often is it going to get stumped? Like, don’t know. Well, I mean, obviously I don’t cover every topic, right? Right. Right. So it should get stumped if you ask it anything that hasn’t been covered. Hopefully it won’t make anything up. That that’s my biggest worry actually.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e40:30\u003cbr/\u003e Yes, and someone sends you an angry email saying they have $130,000 of trinkets that they’ve ordered because Stevebot said, go for it. I’m sure someone’s going to ask, should I sell this item? I was going to say that’s probably going to be the top Stevebot. Then it’ll probably reference all the niche research ones and tell it, if it follows under these guidelines, that’s what I hope it’ll answer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e41:00\u003cbr/\u003e Yeah. Okay. We’ll have to do a follow-up episode.  everything’s, I mean, like I said, it’s still transcribing and generating like the files for the, to train the bot right now, but should be done by today. And I should be able to release this bot by tomorrow  at a bare minimum, I think. So yeah, I can’t wait.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e41:20\u003cbr/\u003e Hope you enjoyed this episode. At some point, I’ll release part of this bot to my Discord community, so stay tuned. For more information and resources, go to mywifequithejob.com slash episode 598.
