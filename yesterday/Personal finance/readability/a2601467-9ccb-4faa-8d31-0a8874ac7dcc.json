I love trying out new ways to make extra income, especially ones that I can do in my free time without a strict schedule. Recently, I tested a GPT (Get Paid To)… MakeMoneyOnline pays you to download apps, play games, and answer surveys. Learn what I think of this new site in my MakeMoneyOnline Review. I love trying out new ways to make extra income, especially ones that I can do in my free time without a strict schedule. Recently, I tested a GPT (Get Paid To) site called MakeMoneyOnline. This site promises to pay users to complete easy online tasks like playing games (such as solitaire), answering surveys, and trying new apps. If you’ve been on my blog before, you know I’ve made hundreds of dollars testing platforms like this – some are great and some not so much. So today, I’m sharing my honest review of MakeMoneyOnline. I’ll cover how it works, what I earned, what I liked and didn’t like, and whether it’s worth your time. Quick summary: I recently tested MakeMoneyOnline to see if it was a real way to earn extra money. I ended up making $21.87 and successfully cashed out to Amazon. On MakeMoneyOnline, you can get paid to do simple things like play games, answer surveys, sign up for apps, and complete offers. However, I did run into some tracking issues where certain offers didn’t credit properly and I was not a fan of that. Click here to sign up for MakeMoneyOnline. MakeMoneyOnline Review Below is my MakeMoneyOnline review. What is MakeMoneyOnline? MakeMoneyOnline (also known as MMO) is a GPT site where you can earn points (which convert to cash or gift cards) by doing small online tasks. It’s operated by Mint Town (the site used to share the same name but they recently changed it), a company based in Tokyo, Japan. The site works for those in the United States, as well as many other countries around the world. The site includes offers from advertisers – everything from survey sites to games you download and play. When you complete a task, the advertiser pays MakeMoneyOnline, and MakeMoneyOnline shares a portion of that payout with you. What makes them stand out is that they show you how their payouts compare to other platforms like Freecash. You can see in real time if you’re getting more money for the same task, which I thought was interesting. For example, MakeMoneyOnline pays (at the time of me writing this article) $8.40 for a Capital One Shopping sign-up, whereas Freecash only pays $5.40 (according to MakeMoneyOnline). Here’s an example of what you can earn on MakeMoneyOnline. How does MakeMoneyOnline work? The platform is free to join, and setup only takes a few minutes. Once you create an account, you’ll be shown a list of offers that pay you to complete specific tasks. These tasks might include: Taking a survey Downloading an app and reaching a certain level or milestone in a game Signing up for a free trial of a service Watching a short video Answering a quiz Each task shows how much you’ll earn in points, which can be redeemed for real money or gift cards. The more complex the task, the more you’ll earn. Real examples of tasks I tried Here are some of the real offers I tested: Survey Junkie: Paid points just for joining and completing surveys Capital One Shopping: Sign up and earn points (no purchase required) Mobile games: I tested a solitaire game where you got paid to reach certain levels Here’s proof that I earned a $20 Amazon gift card on MakeMoneyOnline. My honest experience using MakeMoneyOnline Okay, let’s talk about what actually happened when I used the site. I signed up and got started right away with a handful of offers. I spent a few hours over a couple of days testing different tasks. Some of them tracked correctly and credited my account without any issues. Others didn’t track at all – which was frustrating (I have tested out a lot of different GPT sites over the years, and I have actually never had a tracking issue until I tried out MakeMoneyOnline). After completing a mix of surveys, app installs, and game levels, I earned enough to cash out $20. I requested an Amazon withdrawal, and it took a few days to get approved by MakeMoneyOnline, but I did get approved. So yes, they really do pay. That said, I did have trouble with some of the tasks not tracking properly. I followed all the instructions (downloading, signing up, reaching the goal), but nothing was posted to my account. I looked into it and found a page explaining why this might happen: You already had the app installed before You didn’t complete the full task as instructed You used a VPN or ad blocker The app didn’t track your action properly due to a network glitch I tested out around 15 tasks, 4 paid, and only 2 properly tracked. The other two I chased down with the company to see why I was denied, and they ended up paying me the money after I gave them proof. Many of the others were rejected for many different reasons, such as my IP address being declined. I did try on both an iOS device as well as an Android device, but tasks were still not properly tracking (I wanted to see if it was maybe just my phone that was having issues). If you want to request a manual review, you’ll need to provide proof – like screenshots, confirmation emails, submitting a ticket, or invoices. This isn’t super convenient, but at least they do have a way to fix it. To their credit, MakeMoneyOnline told me they’ve improved their support system recently, so tracking issues should be resolved more efficiently going forward. Below is a screenshot of my account to show you some of the tasks I tried on this site: What rewards can you redeem? I was happy to see that MakeMoneyOnline has a lot of reward choices. You can redeem your points for: PayPal cash Visa gift cards Amazon, Google Play, Apple, and Walmart gift cards Roblox, Nintendo, Steam, Uber, and Starbucks The minimum withdrawal is low and payout times were okay in my experience. I cashed out my $20 and had no issues receiving the funds. Things to know before you start Before you use the site, here are a few tips and guidelines to remember: Read each offer carefully. You have to follow every step exactly – otherwise, it may not track. Don’t use a VPN or ad blocker. These can interfere with tracking your rewards. Check your device settings. Make sure apps can track usage, or it might not register. Submit proof if needed. If a task doesn’t track, you’ll need things like confirmation emails or screenshots of the completed action. Use your points before 180 days. They do expire if unused (if you’ve been inactive on the site). These rules aren’t unique to MakeMoneyOnline – they apply to many GPT sites. But following them will help you earn more and avoid headaches. Is MakeMoneyOnline legit? Yes, it’s legit. I made $21.87, cashed out $20.00, and received my money. Is it perfect? No. Some offers didn’t track and I had to spend extra time figuring that out. But that is sometimes common across this industry, and I was happy to see the company is aware of it and has taken steps to improve its support system. If you like the idea of making extra money in your spare time by completing small tasks, then MakeMoneyOnline is worth a try. Just be patient, keep your expectations reasonable, and don’t forget to screenshot your progress. I also liked how Make Money Online has higher payouts than its competitors. MakeMoneyOnline even has a section on their dashboard right when you log in that lists the payout amounts you get from them versus competitors, so you can easily see how much money you can earn. How to sign up and start earning You can click here to get started. Or you can enter my referral code NAMA2YBG when you sign up on the app. Right now, there’s a 10% referral bonus, so if you invite friends, you’ll earn a portion of what they earn too without taking anything from them (this is their referral program). This can be a form of passive income, which is nice. What other reviews on rewards sites do you have? If you are looking to learn more about other rewards and survey sites, I have in-depth reviews on several of them. You can find them below: Freecash Review Swagbucks Review KashKick Review User Interviews Review Branded Surveys Review Pinecone Research Review Five Surveys Review Prime Opinion Review American Consumer Opinion Review Survey Junkie Review Screenshot of their Trustpilot reviews. Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about MakeMoneyOnline. Is MakeMoneyOnline a scam? Is MakeMoneyOnline safe? Yes, MakeMoneyOnline is legit. I personally tested it and received a payment of $20. However, not every offer may track perfectly, so always read the instructions and follow the directions you are given. Also, MakeMoneyOnline has a rating of 4.2 out of 5 stars on Trustpilot. It looks like most people have a good time with MakeMoneyOnline, so I’m not sure why I had such a problem with the tasks I tried not tracking properly. How much can you make on MakeMoneyOnline? It depends on how much time you spend and which tasks you choose. Some people make just a few dollars, while others can make $50 or more a week. High-paying offers like game levels or sign-ups usually pay more (and faster) than surveys. How long does it take to get money on MakeMoneyOnline? I was able to cash out my earnings after a couple of days of using the platform. Once I requested my payment, it was approved and sent. How long does MakeMoneyOnline take to withdraw? In my experience, first you have to convert your cash-out to a withdrawal. It is then approved, and then you can cash out. It took a couple of days for the approval, but after that the cash-out was easy. What is the minimum payout for MakeMoneyOnline? The minimum payout for MakeMoneyOnline is $5. MakeMoneyOnline Review – Summary I hope you enjoyed my MakeMoneyOnline Review and reading about my real and genuine experience using the site. If you’re looking for a simple way to earn a little extra cash on the side and for side hustle ideas from home, MakeMoneyOnline is an option. I liked that it had high payouts on certain tasks and a wide range of rewards. The experience wasn’t perfect – some tracking issues did come up – but I did get paid in the end for some of the offers. Try it for yourself and see how much you can earn. Just be sure to keep your expectations realistic, read the offer instructions closely, and check back often to see if your tasks are tracking properly (you can look at the “My Offers” tab when logged in to see).
