Whether you want to make extra money to pay for extra expenses, save for travel, or… Wondering what is the best side hustle for retirees? Retirement is a time to relax, yes, but that doesn’t mean you have to stop earning money. Many retirees look for side hustles to make extra income and stay active. Whether you want to make extra money to pay for extra expenses, save for travel, or just keep your mind busy, a side hustle can be great. And, you can choose something that fits your interests and lifestyle. For example, maybe you want to turn a lifelong hobby into a small business, help others with your expertise, or find a flexible job that keeps you social. There are plenty of opportunities for retirees to make money without feeling like they’re back in a full-time job and “working.” Today, I’ll share some of the best retirement side hustles. These ideas are flexible, rewarding, and can help you enjoy retirement while earning extra income. Whether you want to work from home, stay active in your community, or try something completely new, there’s an option for you. Best Side Hustles for Retirees Below are the best side hustles for retired people. 1. Bookkeeping Bookkeeping is a great side hustle for retired people where you can help small businesses keep track of their money. Many companies need someone to manage their finances part-time, so this means you can work flexible hours from home. Some retirees with finance backgrounds find this work especially rewarding because you can use your expertise while earning extra income. But, you also don’t need to have a finance degree to be a bookkeeper. Bookkeeping can be a steady source of income. Rates vary, but experienced bookkeepers usually charge around $25 to $50 per hour.

Start a blog I started my blog as a side hustle, and I think it can be a fun and rewarding side hustle for retirees. This is because you can write about topics you’re passionate about, share your knowledge with others, blog from home, and do it all on your own time. You can blog about many different topics such as: Personal finance Travel Cooking Gardening Painting Or any other hobby that you love. You can make money from your blog in different ways such as ads, sponsored posts, and affiliate marketing. Recommended reading: How To Monetize A Blog: How I Grew A $5 Million Blog. Also, you can join my How To Start A Blog FREE Course. In this free course, I teach you how to start a blog, from the technical side to earning your first income and attracting readers. Over 80,000 people have taken this! 3. Airbnb hosting Airbnb hosting can be a great side hustle for retirees. If you own a vacation property, you can rent it out to travelers. You can choose how often to host (it could be just when you’re not personally using your property, for example) and set your own prices. You can rent them out long-term or short-term – it’s up to you. Another idea related to this is to rent out an unused room in your home. If you have a spare room in your home, then you may want to try renting it out on a long-term basis (college students, travel nurses, and others are typically looking for longer-term stays). This can be a source of passive income too! Before you start, you’ll want to check local laws about renting rooms, as some areas have rules you need to follow (and some areas may only allow long-term renters). Also, think about the kind of renter you want and set clear house rules (such as limits on noise or parties). Renting a room can bring in consistent income each month. It’s also a chance to meet new people and maybe even make friends. Just be sure you’re comfortable sharing your space before you jump in. I have rented out rooms in my home in the past, and for the most part, it went well (of course, there are typical roommate squabbles, but having a good agreement beforehand and outlining rules can really help). I made around $400 per room per month, but this was also in a low-cost-of-living area. In certain areas, you may be able to earn $1,000+ each month per room that you rent out. Also, another side hustle related to this is renting out your RV. If you have an RV that you’re not using, you could make $100 to $300 a day, or more, by renting it out to others through RVshare. You can learn more about RVshare here. Recommended reading: How We Reached Financial Independence Using Airbnb \u0026 Real Estate 4. Photography Photography can be a fun and creative side hustle for retirees. Some ways to make money with photography include: Stock photos Family portraits Wedding photos Food photography Event photography And so much more. Recommended reading: 18 Ways To Get Paid To Take Pictures 5. Freelance writing Freelance writing online can be a great side hustle for retirees. You can use your knowledge and experience to create content for websites, blogs, and magazines. Many companies need writers for different projects, such as articles, product descriptions, or even books. The best part is you can work from home and set your own schedule. I have been a freelance writer for years, and I know several retired people who freelance write in their spare time for extra income. They are able to write about topics that they are passionate about, and make extra money while doing something that they love. Recommended reading: 14 Ways To Find Freelance Writing Jobs – (Start With No Experience!) 6. Paid online surveys If you’re looking for a simple way to make money in your spare time, then you may want to try sharing your opinions with market research companies and getting paid for it. Market research companies pay you because they want to hear what you think of their products and if you think you’d find them useful. This can then influence how they advertise their product or it may change the product entirely. Popular survey sites include: American Consumer Opinion Survey Junkie Swagbucks InboxDollars Branded Surveys Prime Opinion Five Surveys User Interviews I have taken many surveys over the years, and I think they are easy to do. They won’t make you rich, but you may be able to make $50 to $100 a month from your couch while watching TV or relaxing at home. It’s an easy side hustle from home for retirees looking to stay busy and make extra cash. 7. Craft selling on Etsy Etsy is a great place for retired people to sell handmade crafts. If there’s a hobby that you enjoy, you may be able to turn it into a fun side job that makes money. I have some retired friends who do this. For example, I have friends who make pottery, jewelry, knitted items (like scarves and hats), woodworking items like wood pens, paintings, and more and sell them.

Elder companion Being an elder companion (also known as a caregiver or personal care assistant) is a great side hustle for retirees, especially if you’re looking for a sense of purpose. You can keep seniors company and help them with daily tasks (like shopping or cooking) or you might just talk with them, play games, and go on walks. Many families look for someone that they can trust to spend time with their elderly relatives. You can work part-time or full-time, depending on what you want. Some companies hire elder companions, or you can work independently (you may be able to find jobs on Facebook or through word of mouth). 9. Play games on your phone Playing games on your phone can be a fun way to make some extra money in retirement. Many apps pay cash or gift cards for playing easy games. Here’s a quick list of the top game apps that pay real cash: Freecash InboxDollars KashKick Swagbucks These apps typically pay you to test out new apps, watch ads within the game, or beat certain levels. Now, playing games on your phone won’t be a full-time job. You may be able to earn a couple hundred dollars a month with these apps, though. I have personally made $302 playing games on my phone in just one week. You can read about my experience at How I Made $302.80 Playing Games on My Phone (In One Week). 10. Business consulting Business consulting can be a great side hustle for retired people. You can use your years of work experience to help other businesses succeed. Business consultants give advice to companies on how to improve their operations and help with things such as cutting costs, increasing sales, or making their teams work better together. You can focus on the industry you worked in before retiring. For example, if you worked in marketing, you could help small businesses with their advertising plans. I know a few people who are business consultants as their retirement side hustle and really enjoy it. They get to continue to use their skills, and they typically say that it is easy work for them to do. 11. Tutoring Tutoring can be a great side hustle for retirement. Many students need help with subjects like math, science, or English. Whether you were a teacher, worked in a specialized field, or just enjoy a particular subject, tutoring can be a rewarding way to stay engaged and earn extra money. Tutors can tutor in person or online – online tutoring lets you work from home and reach more students, which is nice. To find tutoring jobs, you can check out local schools, community centers, or online tutoring platforms like Wyzant or Tutor.com. You can also spread the word to friends and family – they might know someone looking for help! 12. Pet sitting and dog walking Pet sitting and dog walking can be fun ways to earn extra money in retirement. You get to spend time with animals while helping busy pet owners. Pet sitters take care of pets in their home or the owner’s home. This could mean feeding, playing with, going for walks, and watching pets while their owners are away. I have hired a few dog sitters over the years, and many times the person was retired and looking for a way to make some extra money while staying at home. You can find pet sitting and dog walking jobs through dog walking apps or websites. Or you can ask friends and neighbors if they need help with their pets. 13. Tour guide If you love talking, meeting new people, sharing stories, and have a passion for your local area, then being a tour guide can be an interesting way to earn money in retirement. You don’t need to live in a big city to be a tour guide. Even small towns have interesting history or nature spots that you could be a tour guide for. You could lead walking tours downtown, take people on hikes in nearby parks, or take people on food tours where you introduce visitors to favorite local restaurants. You may be able to find tour guide jobs by looking into local tourism boards or tour companies. You can also create your own tours and list them on websites like Airbnb Experiences. 14. Childcare Watching kids can be a fun way to earn extra money in retirement, and especially if you like spending time with little ones, this could be perfect for you. Many parents need help with childcare, and they want someone they can trust to look after their kids. As a retiree, you may have lots of life experience that makes you a great fit. I am in a parent’s group on Facebook in my local area, and I often see retired people offering to babysit on the weekends, after school, over summer breaks, and more, so this is a popular retirement income idea. 15. Campground host I have RVed for around 10 years now (around half of that I was a full-time RVer), and I have always said that if I was retired and wanted to make extra money, I would become a campground host. Yes, it looks like hard work, but it looks enjoyable as well. I have seen campground host job listings for the most amazing and beautiful places (such as on the beach, in a national park, in a mountain valley, and more), and it’s always seemed like a fun gig to me. If you love the outdoors and meeting new people, becoming a campground host can be a great retirement side hustle. Campground hosts work at state parks, national parks, and private campgrounds, helping with tasks like greeting visitors, maintaining the campsites, and sharing information about the area. In return, they usually receive free campsite accommodations (and free water/electric), and some positions also pay a monthly stipend too. To find campground host jobs, check with the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, state parks, and private campground websites. Positions fill up fast for the really good spots, so applying early is a good idea. 16. Virtual assistant Being a virtual assistant is a great side job for retirees because you can work from home and use your skills to help businesses with tasks. Virtual assistants do tasks like answer emails, schedule appointments, data entry, make travel plans, handle customer service, or manage social media accounts. Many companies need virtual assistants and jobs can be found on websites like Upwork or Fiverr. Virtual assistant jobs are typically fairly flexible. You can often choose your hours and how much work you want to do. It’s perfect if you want to earn extra money but still have time for other activities. 10Proofread AnywhereThis free 76-minute workshop answers all of the most common questions about how to become a proofreader, and even talks about the 5 signs that proofreading could be a perfect fit for you.
