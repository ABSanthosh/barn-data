  "text": "Big cities might have big appeal — but they’re not the only places worth visiting.The term “second cities” traditionally refers to a region’s second-largest city, but it generally describes other populous but often overlooked urban centers that deliver much of what major metropolises do.To be clear, these aren’t small towns off the highway. Second cities have the cultural richness, culinary chops and charisma of the better-known metropolises, but usually with fewer crowds and sometimes lower prices. They're well worth adding to your itinerary, or even planning a full trip around.Why second cities strike the sweet spotSecond cities offer the best of both worlds when you're looking for a destination with things to do, but slightly less touristy.Here’s what makes them appealing:Less chaos: With fewer tourists and less traffic, second cities often feel less stressful than their bustling counterparts. For a relaxing trip, that might be exactly what you’re looking for. Your friends likely haven’t been there yet: By visiting a second city, you’ll be able to experience the culture, food and history of a certain region beyond the usual tourist checklist. And your trip might be more memorable because of it. Easy transportation: In many second cities, you can walk or rely on occasional rideshares. That saves on rental cars, gas and parking fees.Free or cheap things to do: Much like their larger counterparts, second cities often pack in cultural institutions, scenic parks, historic sites and local entertainment — often for little or no cost.Second cities in the U.S. that are worth a lookWe compiled some of the second cities that make great vacation destinations. This isn't a formal ranking or an exhaustive list — just some of our favorite spots.The Alamo in San Antonio, Texas.Looking at Houston? Try San Antonio, TexasJust a three-hour drive away from Houston — Texas’ largest city and a major business hub — San Antonio offers a visitor-friendly experience, with walkable attractions, lower prices and historic charm. Plus, many of San Antonio’s top attractions are either free or cheap. You can explore much of the iconic Alamo at no cost, stroll the San Antonio River Walk (one of the country’s most charming pedestrian corridors), or wander through the Japanese Tea Garden — all without spending a dime.Atlantic City, New Jersey. Looking at New York City? Try Atlantic City, New Jersey Just over two hours by bus or train from Manhattan, Atlantic City delivers many of the same urban draws: headline concerts, high-end dining, boutique shopping and even a budding arts scene. But where New York commands premium prices at every turn, Atlantic City still offers off-peak hotel rooms under $100.Santa Barbara, California.Looking at Los Angeles? Go for Santa Barbara, CaliforniaThink glamping, kayaking, wine-tasting and art galleries. Santa Barbara has it all with Pacific views and way less traffic. Madison, Wisconsin. Looking at Chicago? Visit Madison, WisconsinChicago is the original second city, earning the nickname in the 1890s when it became the second-largest city in the U.S. behind New York. (Now it's third, behind Los Angeles.) But if you’re looking for another great destination near Chicago, Madison is worth a visit. Pedal around the lakeside trails, stroll through the Dane County Farmers’ Market, then unwind at a brewery or kayak launch just steps from the Capitol dome.Flagstaff, Arizona.Looking at Phoenix? Head to Flagstaff, Arizona Flagstaff’s neon signs, retro diners and ties to the historic Route 66 highway make it a memorable road trip destination. Nature lovers can cool off beneath Ponderosa pines and explore volcanic caves in this laid-back mountain town.How to maximize your rewards",
