In fact, if you start now you could save hundreds of dollars on presents, decorations, and essentials. By starting early, you can easily tackle your Christmas shopping on a budget. Plus, you’ll eliminate the stress and pressure of waiting until next year’s holiday season to get everything done. Here are easy shopping tips that you can do now to prepare for Christmas 2025.1. Stock Up on DecorationsImage Source: PexelsMost retailers like Target, Hobby Lobby, and Walmart are running 70%-90% off of Christmas items right now. You may have to visit a few stores to find what you’re looking for, but the discounts right now can’t be beaten. Don’t wait until next year to replace your Christmas lights and pay full price.2. Buy Wrapping Paper and SuppliesNow is the best time to buy leftover wrapping paper, bows, and Christmas cards. You can find discounted items at CVS, Walgreens, and Michael’s that will all discount their leftover Christmas supplies. It’s never too early to stock up!3. Buy Gifts on SaleImage Source: PexelsJanuary sales often rival Black Friday prices. This is mainly because retailers have inventory that they need to sell leftover from the holidays and total sales for retailers are typically slower so they incentivize purchases. Last January, online retail sales grew 25.47% year over year, according to CNBC and the National Retail Federation’s Retail Monitor. Therefore it’s likely that there will be deep discounts again this year at most retailers. There are certain categories that you should consider buying now instead of waiting until next year if you want the best price. However, some categories like electronics will always have the best deals around Black Friday. Here’s what you should focus on to buy right now.Athletic Apparel and EquipmentAfter Christmas sales at your favorite retailers are some of the best. For example, Amazon is running 40% off fitness gear and apparel and Lululemon has apparel starting at nine dollars. You can also find steep discounts on home workout equipment from companies like Peloton and even on Amazon.Home GoodsYou can check out department stores like Macy’s that made January famous for ‘white sales’.  Bedspreads, towels, sheets, and more are discounted during this time to make space for fresh inventory. This is also the best time to shop for small kitchen appliances. Last year Best Buy had up to 67% off small kitchen appliances and Keurig slashed starter kits to 75% off. Beauty ItemsHoliday gift sets that are left over from the holiday are usually further discounted. Target is known to have leftover gift sets from popular brands that are perfect for stocking stuffers for next year. In January, ULTA also has its Love Your Skin Event which is usually 50% off. Victoria’s Secret annual sale is also the best time to buy beauty items and fragrances at up to 60% off. Winter Clothes and AccessoriesMost retailers will start heavily discounting coats and sweaters in January. Be on the lookout for sales at Eddie Bauer, REI, and J. Crew to name a few. Even some accessory brands are dropping prices. For instance, Kate Spade is having an incredible sale with pieces starting at $11. You can’t beat the deep discounts that retailers are offering right now, especially if you want to Christmas shop on a budget for next year.Christmas Shopping on a BudgetIf you’re looking for the best deals to Christmas shop on a budget, now is the best time to do so.
