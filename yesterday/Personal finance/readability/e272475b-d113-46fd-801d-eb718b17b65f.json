  "text": "As we wrap up 2024, it’s time to highlight the best posts from Financial Samurai this year. When I started Financial Samurai in July 2009, my goal was to publish three posts a week for 10 years. I achieved that milestone in July 2019, but much like Forrest Gump, I kept on going. Writing has always been my creative outlet, bringing me joy and purpose. Now, as a father to two young children (5 and 7.5), my goal is to keep writing until they turn 18 in 2037. I hope that by demonstrating discipline and focus through my work, they’ll be inspired to take their academics seriously. Life will throw setbacks our way, and excuses will always be easy to find, but if we keep going, it's hard to fail. Since 2009, my North Star has been helping as many people as possible achieve financial freedom sooner. Financial confidence not only leads to happier and kinder individuals but also strengthens families and improves society as a whole. Hearing from readers who have been positively impacted by Financial Samurai is always incredibly rewarding and keeps me motivated to continue this work.

Everything I write is based on firsthand experiences, with the hope of elucidating blind spots and solving problems. I also enjoy sharing surprising realizations about money that you might not have thought about before. Finally, engaging in courteous debates and listening to reader perspectives makes writing for Financial Samurai fun. Out of the 156 posts I've written in 2024, these are some of my favorites in no particular order. Financial Samurai has received over 12 million page views in 2024 and has been featured in almost all of the major media outlets. If you haven't read some of these posts before, I hope you will and share your thoughts. There's always something new to learn! 1) Blew Up My Passive Income and Am No Longer Financially Independent This post defined Financial Samurai’s tone and direction in 2024. I revealed that we’re no longer financially independent based on my definition: passive income covering desired living expenses. While some readers prefer using the 25X expenses or 20X gross income definitions, I’ve stayed consistent with this definition since 2009. Changing the definition of FIRE to fit your financial progress can be dangerous. It breeds complacency and may lead to poor financial decisions. For instance, following Coast FIRE can be misleading if you’re not realistic about its limitations. Stay disciplined and avoid self-delusion. 2) Why Retiring Early Is Obviously Better Than Retiring Rich Since 2009, one of my goals has been to help readers build wealth while avoiding the trap of endlessly chasing more. It’s a tough balance, especially after years of ingrained saving and investing habits. The “one more year syndrome” can get to the best of us! If your job no longer excites you, consider retiring early. The extra money you might accumulate often isn’t worth the opportunity cost of time lost. Retiring early doesn’t mean financial ruin—it gives you the freedom to explore other passions or simply take a much-needed break. 3) The Minimum Investment Amount Where Work Becomes Optional To answer the age-old question, “How much is enough?” I introduced the Minimum Investment Threshold Formula. This formula takes the inverse of the historical return on your assets and multiplies it by your gross annual income. Reaching this threshold means your investments have a high chance of generating returns equal to or greater than your salary, freeing you to explore other opportunities, take a sabbatical, or retire early. 4) Careful Giving Up Your Career to Be a Stay-at-Home Parent As a stay-at-home parent for over seven years, I wanted to share some advice for those considering the same path. It’s easy to prioritize your child over your career, but it’s not always the best decision for everyone. This post explores how to strike a balance between fulfilling your parental role and maintaining your personal goals. Every family is different, but I advocate for a balanced approach rather than going to extremes. 5) Went Back to Work and Could Only Last Four Months With my daughter starting full-time school in September 2024, I decided to reenter the workforce part-time in late 2023. My goal was to contribute to building a fintech startup while maintaining a purposeful 20-hour workweek. I anticipated having more free time with her in school and saw this as an opportunity to fill the eventual void. Plus, I wanted to rebuild liquidity after purchasing a new home. However, reality didn’t align with my expectations. The part-time role quickly encroached on time with my daughter, who had Tuesdays and Thursdays off. This imbalance felt wrong, and by March 2024, I made the decision to step away. 6) A Vacation Spending Guide: The True Cost Is More Than You Think Talking to fellow parents, I realized many don’t follow the same personal finance principles we discuss here. For instance, one family spent a staggering amount on a Hawaiian vacation. This inspired me to create a guide for vacation spending that balances fun with financial responsibility. It’s a framework to help you enjoy vacations without risking financial strain afterward. 7) The Financial Doom You Read and See Is Probably Not Real Doom and gloom dominate the financial media because negativity sells. But if you look around—packed restaurants, bustling roads—it’s clear the U.S. consumer is doing well. This post, written in June 2024, is a reminder to focus on what’s actually happening around you and to avoid being swayed by constant bearish predictions. Getting gaslit into thinking the world is coming to the end is not the way to building wealth. 8) The Right House-to-Car Ratio for Financial Freedom I love simple financial ratios, and this one blends my car and home-buying rules into a simple guideline for financial freedom seekers. It builds on my 1/10th Rule for car purchases and my 30/30/3 Rule for home buying. Following these ratios can help you balance two major expenses—housing and transportation—while maintaining financial stability. Given the majority of people drive and everybody needs a place to live, the house-to-car ratio may be the most pertinent ratio of all. 9) Obtaining a Top 1% Net Worth Is Easier Than Ever Knight Frank’s report showed that a top 1% net worth is surprisingly lower than many of us expected. This post explores the idea that wealth isn’t always about numbers but about feeling financially secure and able to live the life you want. 10) Climbed to the Top of the Property Ladder and Feel No Happier Be careful getting what you want. If you don't manage your expectations, you may be disappointed. After 20 years of climbing the property ladder, I bought what I thought was my dream home. It had everything I wanted: a view, an oversized lot, and a great location. Yet, I didn’t feel happier after the purchase. Instead, I felt anxious about my reduced liquidity and experienced a “trough of sorrow” after achieving this long-term goal. This post is a reflection on finding balance and avoiding the trap of always chasing more. 11) A $20 Million Net Worth Should Be Enough To Live Happy And Free This was a fun exploration of various households with over $20 million in net worth—a sum that might seem mind-boggling to some. Yet, with enough time, compounding, and a bit of luck, achieving a $20 million net worth is possible. You might assume everyone with $20+ million feels happy and free, but as this article reveals, that’s not always the case. No matter how much wealth we accumulate, we all face ongoing challenges in life. 12) Reducing The Traditional Retirement Age From 65 To 55 Works The traditional retirement age has been 65 for decades. However, after my conversation with Bill Bengen, the father of the 4% Rule, I’ve concluded that America could reduce the traditional retirement age to 55! Saving 10 years of work for over 100 million working Americans would be a monumental shift. If everyone believed this was achievable, it could become one of the greatest drivers of happiness and purpose in our nation’s history. Read the post and listen to our conversation to decide for yourself.
