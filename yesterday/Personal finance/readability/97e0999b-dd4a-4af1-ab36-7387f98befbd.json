As the temperatures drop, you might find yourself with more free time and the perfect chance to earn income. Or, perhaps you’re looking for winter side hustles so that you can put money toward the holiday season. Whatever your reason is, finding the right winter side hustle can bring in extra cash and make the most of your time. Best Winter Side Hustles Below are the best winter side hustles. 1. Snow removal Snow removal is a great way to make extra money in the winter. When snow covers everything, people need help clearing their driveways, sidewalks, and even their roofs. You can offer to shovel snow or use a snow blower. It’s a service that many people will pay for, especially after heavy snowfall. You don’t need much to start and to find potential clients. Basic tools like a sturdy shovel, warm clothes, and maybe a snow blower will do. A snow blower can be a good investment if you plan to help a lot of people. It makes the job faster and easier, which means you can help more customers. 2. Sell printables on Etsy Selling printables on Etsy is a great way to make extra money during the winter. Printables are digital files that buyers can download and print at home. This side hustle is perfect if you want to work from home and set your own hours. You can design things like planners, calendars, art prints, or even holiday-themed items. If you enjoy being creative, this could be a perfect fit for you. You don’t need a lot of experience to get started. There are many online tutorials to help you learn how to design and list your printables. Selling printables allows you to earn passive income. Once you upload your designs, they can be sold over and over without any extra work. It’s a great way to make money while you sleep!

People love cozy and unique items during the colder months. Plus, handmade gifts are perfect for holidays. You can knit scarves, hats, and mittens. These items are always in demand. You can also make holiday ornaments and decorations. If you enjoy making crafts, you can sell them online. Websites like Etsy make it easy to reach buyers. Another option is to showcase your products at local holiday markets in a booth. These events are popular in winter. 4. Paid online surveys Paid online surveys are a great way to make extra money during the winter. Many websites pay you for sharing your opinions. It’s simple, and you can do it from the comfort of your home. Paid online surveys might not make you rich, but they are a fun and easy way to earn some extra money. The survey companies I recommend signing up for include: Prime Opinion Swagbucks Branded Surveys Five Surveys PrizeRebel American Consumer Opinion Survey Junkie InboxDollars I’ve done lots of surveys over the years and have earned over 100 free gift cards. What I like about them is that you can do them whenever you want – in the morning, at lunchtime, or before bed. You don’t need to follow a strict schedule, and they’re really easy to do. 5. Freelance writing Freelance writing is a great side hustle in the winter. If you like writing, this might be perfect for you because you can work from home and stay warm in the winter! As a freelance writer, you can write many things. This includes blog posts, articles, and even short stories. You get paid by the word or by the project. I have been a freelance writer for years, and I love how flexible this side hustle is. You can take on as many or as few writing projects as you’d like, which can be great if you are looking for a way to make extra income only in the winter. 6. Pet sitting Pet sitting is a great way to make money during the winter. You get to stay inside and be warm while taking care of pets. Many people travel during the holidays so they need someone to look after their furry friends. This is where you come in! Pet sitters might feed cats, walk dogs, or even cuddle them. Pet owners will pay you to make sure their pets are happy and safe. There are apps like Rover that can help you get started. These apps let you find pet sitting gigs easily. You just create a profile, and people can hire you. Or, you can even put up flyers on a local bulletin board (such as at a grocery store or community center near you). 7. Virtual assistant Becoming a virtual assistant is a great side hustle to start this winter. As a virtual assistant, you can work from the comfort of your home, helping businesses or busy individuals with different tasks. You might handle scheduling, email management, social media, or even simple bookkeeping tasks. This role is very flexible, and you can choose how many hours you work each week. If you are organized and good at multitasking, this job could be a perfect fit for you. Many people are looking for help with their daily tasks, and you could be the one to assist them. The pay for virtual assistants can vary. Some earn an hourly rate, while others might charge per task or project. On average, virtual assistants can earn between $15 and $30 an hour, depending on their skills and experience. 8. Renting out winter gear Winter is a great time to make money by renting out gear like skis, snowboards, and sleds. Many people want to enjoy winter sports, but buying new gear can be expensive. If you already own winter gear, renting it out can bring in extra cash. People often look for affordable ways to enjoy winter activities without spending a lot on new equipment. Make sure your gear is in good condition, and this may mean that you clean it and check for any damage. This way, your renters will have a good experience and might come back next season. 9. House sitting House sitting is a great winter side hustle. Many people travel during the cold months, leaving their homes empty so they need someone to watch over their house while they are away. A house sitter’s main job is to keep the house safe. They might need to water plants, collect mail, and sometimes care for pets. It’s pretty easy and can be quite relaxing. You can find house sitting gigs through websites like Rover or local community boards. Some people even turn this into a regular side job, bouncing from house to house. 10. Online tutoring Online tutoring is a great way to make extra money during the winter. You can teach kids or adults in different subjects. Many platforms let you choose your own rates and hours, so you can work when it suits you. Plus, some parents like to fit in extra tutoring during the winter months because there are a lot more days off from school, and they don’t want their child to fall behind. 11. Catering for holiday events Catering for holiday events can be a great way to make extra money in the winter. Many companies and families throw parties during the holiday season. They need people to help prepare food, serve meals, and clean up after the events. A typical catering shift can last anywhere from 7 to 10 hours. This means you can earn a good amount of money in just one day. Catering jobs can be found through local catering companies, event planning services, or online job boards. It can be a flexible side hustle that fits around your other commitments. Some events might be on weekends or evenings, which is perfect if you have a day job. 12. Blogging Blogging can be a great winter side hustle. You can start a blog right from your home, making it perfect for cold days. For me, I worked on my blog as a side hustle for a couple of years before it became my full-time job. And in the winter, I would typically take some extra days off around the holidays so that I could use all of my vacation days at the end of the year, and I would use those “off” days for working on my blog as a side hustle! I have free training that you can take – How To Start A Blog FREE Course. Want to see how I built a $5,000,000 blog? In this free course, I show you how to create a blog, from the technical side to earning your first income and attracting readers. 13. Holiday decorating Holiday decorating can be a fun and profitable winter side hustle. Many people love the festive look during the holiday season but don’t have the time or skills to decorate. You can offer your services to decorate homes, businesses, or event spaces. You get to play with lights, tinsel, and ornaments to create a magical atmosphere. Word of mouth is extremely important and helpful with this type of side hustle, so make sure that you are providing a high-quality service where you get repeat customers! 14. Dropshipping winter products Dropshipping is a great way to make money without having to keep inventory. You can sell winter products that people need when it’s cold. Thermal clothes are a must-have. They help people stay warm and are very popular in the winter. Jackets, gloves, and scarves are also useful items you can offer. Another great idea is selling foot warmers and coffee thermal cups. These are small but very handy. People love them on chilly mornings. Beanies and winter hats for children are also items that parents often look for during winter. 15. Christmas tree lot Working at a Christmas tree lot is a fun way to make extra money during the holiday season. You’ll help families in finding the perfect tree, wrap it up, and load it into their cars. The job also includes tasks like setting up displays, trimming branches, and keeping the lot neat and tidy. Christmas tree lots typically start popping up in November and last through Christmas. 16. Ski instructor Becoming a ski instructor can be a fun way to make money in the winter. You get to enjoy the snowy mountains while helping others learn how to ski. If you are good at skiing and like working with people, this could be a great side hustle. Ski instructors often get paid around $20 to $30 per hour and get benefits like free lift passes. This side hustle is especially common in areas with big ski resorts. If you live near one or can travel, it might be the perfect winter job for you. 17. Babysit Babysitting is a great winter side hustle for many reasons, such as parents may need help during the holiday season. They have parties to attend, shopping to do, and sometimes just want a night out. Babysitting can be a flexible job. You can work around your schedule. If you are a student, you can babysit after classes. On weekends, you can take on more hours. 18. Greeting card making Greeting card making is a fun and crafty side hustle, perfect for winter and having a flexible side hustle. You can create custom cards for holidays, birthdays, or special occasions. To get started, you need some supplies like cardstock, markers, and decorations. You can find these at craft stores or online. Once you have your supplies, start designing your cards. You can draw, paint, or even use a computer program to create your designs. Add some thoughtful messages inside to make them special. Selling your cards can be easy too. You can sell them online on online platforms like Etsy or at local craft fairs and markets. It’s a great way to reach people who love handmade items. I actually love buying custom greeting cards, and I just bought one for my husband for a holiday. I bought it on Etsy and I love how it’s a card that I was able to customize just for him. 19. Mail delivery Companies like UPS and FedEx hire thousands of extra workers during the winter months so that they can stay on top of holiday orders. This can be a great place to look for a winter side job! 20. Seasonal retail jobs During the winter, stores get super busy, especially around the holidays. This is when many shops need extra help. Seasonal retail jobs can be a great way for you to make some extra money. Many stores offer flexible hours, so you can work part-time. This makes it easier if you have other commitments, like school or another job. Many retailers start hiring for seasonal positions in September or October. It’s a good idea to apply early if you’re interested. 21. Work one-time gigs on Craigslist If you don’t want a permanent side hustle, working one-time gigs might be perfect for you. Craigslist has a section just for these gigs. You can find work that fits your schedule. One of the great things about these gigs is that you often get paid right after you finish the job. This can be really helpful, especially around the holidays. There are many different types of one-time gigs on Craigslist. For example, you might find jobs like removing yard debris, cleaning houses, or moving big plants. 22. Winter photography Family photography can be a great side hustle in the winter. Many families like to get together during the winter months, which means that they also like to take family photos since everyone is in one place. You can host short photo sessions called mini-sessions, lasting from 20 to 45 minutes. These are popular because they’re quick yet capture great moments, and they’re affordable for families.

People with fireplaces and wood-burning stoves need a steady supply of firewood. You can sell bundles or full cords of wood straight to their doorsteps. 24. Gift wrapping Gift wrapping is a great winter side hustle that you can do from home. Many people have a hard time making their presents look perfect, and they may not have the time or skill to wrap gifts beautifully. During the holiday season, there is high demand for gift wrapping services. People buy gifts for Christmas, Hanukkah, and other celebrations. You can offer your services to family, friends, and neighbors. You can also advertise online or on community boards. You don’t need many supplies to get started, and you most likely just need to buy some wrapping paper, ribbons, and bows. You might also need tape, scissors, and gift tags. You can find these items at local stores or online. Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about how to find winter side hustles. How to make extra cash in the winter?
