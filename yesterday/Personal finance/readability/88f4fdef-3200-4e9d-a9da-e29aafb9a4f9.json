They typically offer low interest rates for qualified borrowers, have flexible repayment terms, and some even offer extra features like career coaching and more. But it can be hard to find the best private loans, and should you even take them out?Private student loans are the last choice when it comes to paying for college. Before you take out private loans, you should make sure you exhaust all other financial aid options, including federal loans. Before you sign on the dotted line, make sure you understand what you're getting into. Student loans are a collateral on your future earnings, and you need to ensure you have a positive ROI (return on investment) of your education.To make things easier, we've put together a list of the best private student loans to help you pay for college. If you want a simple tool to shop around and compare loans, check out Credible, as they make comparing your student loan options easy.

The College Investor's team updates this information regularly, typically Monday-Friday. Rates may have changed since they were last updated and may vary by region for some products.AscentAscent Student Loans is a solid choice as a private lender - as they offer both cosigner and non-cosigner loans for undergraduate and graduate students. They also offer a solid loan amount range from $2,001 - $400,000*, competitive rates, and easy repayment terms.What we love about Ascent is how clear they make their requirements to get the non-cosigned loan for juniors and seniors that considers more than just a credit score, which is rare in the private student loan industry. The qualify, students must:Be a college junior or senior enrolled full-time (or with an expected graduation date within 9-months of the date the loan application is submitted) in a degree program at an eligible institution.Be a U.S. citizen or have a U.S. permanent resident or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) status.Have satisfactory academic performance of 2.9 GPA or greater.They offer loans starting at just $2,001* minimum, and they offer loan deferment while in school up to 9 months after graduation.Read our full Ascent Student Loans review here.Get a quote at Ascent here \u003e\u003eAscent Student Loans DetailsProduct NameAscent Student LoanMin Loan Amount$2,001*Max Loan Amount$400,000Variable APR5.50% - 15.04% APRFixed APR3.69% - 15.28% APRLoan Terms5, 7, 10, 12 15, or 20 yearsCosigner RequiredNoCitizens BankCitizens Bank offers one of the most robust private student loan programs on this list. They let you borrow as little a $1,000, and all the way up to $350,000 depending on your degree. I personally love that they base the amount you can borrow on your degree program because it does help you focus on your ROI (return on investment). Citizens Bank offers both student and parent student loans, which can be a potential alternative to Parent PLUS Loans. Given that we recommend most borrowers refinance Parent PLUS Loans, you can potentially take advantage of lower interest rates and fees up front.You may qualify for multi-year approval when you apply with Citizens Bank. And you'll also have the option to defer payments until after you graduate or make interest-only payments while you're in school. Parent borrowers must make at least interest-only payments while the student is in school. Finally, Citizens Bank also doesn't charge any origination fees, application fees, and has no prepayment penalties. Check out our full Citizens Bank review here.Get a quote from Citizens Bank here \u003e\u003eCitizens Student Loans DetailsProduct NameCitizens Student LoanMin Loan Amount$1,000Max Loan Amount$350,000 (depending on degree)Variable APR5.50% - 16.12% APRFixed APR3.99% - 15.61% APRLoan Terms5, 10, or 15 yearsCosigner RequiredYesCollege AveCollege Ave offers some of the lowest rates on student loans on the market today.

If your income falls below a certain threshold (currently $30,000), your loan goes into deferment. The drawback is that you can only borrow between $15,000 per year ($25,000 aggregate) and only at select schools for select programs.Read our full Edly Student Loan review here.Get a quote at Edly here \u003e\u003eEdly Student Loan DetailsProduct NameEdly IBR LoanMin Loan Amount$1,000Max Loan Amount$15,000 Per Year$25,000 Aggregate MaximumIncome Percent8.49% to 25.96%Lifetime MaxRepayment cap of 23% APRTerm Length60 to 84 payments, depending on loan typeCosigner RequiredNoELFIELFI is one of the largest student loan originators, and as a result, they typically offer some of the lowest student loan rates available.They offer extremely competitive rates, with standard loan terms and conditions.

LendKey's loans are funded by credit unions and community banks - so you're getting a great loan, but it's handled by LendKey's online service. You never even realize that you have a private loan from a small bank.LendKey doesn't have quite as much flexibility for borrowers during school. You can make interest-only payments or fixes $25 per month payments while in school (which is still pretty low but not quite as painless as full deferment). LendKey also doesn't offer loans to parents directly.LendKey has no origination fees, application fees, and doesn't charge a prepayment penalty if you pay the loan off early.Read our full LendKey review here.Get a quote at LendKey here \u003e\u003eLendKey Student Loans DetailsProduct NameLendKey Student LoanMin Loan Amount$1,000Max Loan AmountCost of AttendanceVariable APR5.54% - 13.36% APRFixed APR3.99% -12.61% APRLoan Terms5, 10, or 15 yearsCosigner RequiredYesSallie MaeSallie Mae is probably one of the most well-known lenders on this list.

All of the lenders on the list above are great, but each person has a different financial need, so it can be hard to know which is right.When it comes to comparing private student loans, we recommend borrowers look at the following:Interest Rate: Getting the lowest interest rate possible is the key to paying the least amount of interest on your loan. Remember, the higher the rate, the more you pay over the life of the loan.Term: This is how long you'll repay the loan for. Always keep the shortest term possible. The longer the term, the more interest you'll pay.Origination Fees: Look for loans that have low or no origination fees. However, if you can get a lower interest rate by paying a small origination fee, you should consider it. The origination fee is one-time, but the interest rate is ongoing.Application Fees: You should look for private loans with no application fees.Prepayment Penalties: You should look for loans that don't make you pay a penalty for paying the loan off early.Cosigner Release: 90% of private student loans require a cosigner. You should find a student loan that allows you to release the cosigner in the least amount of time possible. The best we usually see is 24 months of on-time payments.Flexible Repayment Terms: You should look for lenders that allow you flexible repayment options - such as deferment during school, and variable lengths after graduation. This will help you should you need it after graduation.Fixed Rate vs. Variable RateThere are two main types of interest rates on student loans - fixed rates and variable rates. Variable rates are usually \"sexy\" in that they are lower than fixed rates...today. However, variable rates can rise in the future if interest rates go up (they can also go down, but that's very rare). Fixed rate loans charge the same interest rate over the life of the loan. So, should you get a fixed rate or variable rate student loan? For most private loans, you should go for a fixed rate loan. The reason is, we are in a rising interest rate environment. Rates will only rise in the future since we're at historic lows today. You can see the best student loan rates here.Given that you're still in school, you'll have several years before you make payments - during which time your rates could rise with a variable rate loan. So, while variable rates are attractive today, you might be regretting that decision in the future.Now, if you're refinancing an existing student loan and know the timeline of your debt repayment, getting a variable rate loan is less risky. You can see the best places to refinance a student loan here.Understanding Cosigner ReleaseIt is near impossible to get a private student loan without a cosigner. In fact, 90% of all private student loans have a cosigner. The reason? Because private student loans act much more like car loans or mortgages - you need to have income, a high credit score, and more to qualify. For most college students, they simply don't have credit (yet), a high income (because they're students), or an employment history (once again, because they're students). That's why most banks require a cosigner. However, banks and lenders have realized that cosigners don't like to be cosigners, and they want to get off the loans as soon as possible - that's where cosigner release comes into play. Cosigner release is a program offered by lenders where, after a specific number of on-time payments, the cosigner can be removed from the loan. Many banks offer cosigner release after 24-36 on-time payments. This basically proves that the borrower is able to handle the student loan themselves, and they no longer need the protection of having a cosigner. When getting a private student loan, look for loans that have short cosigner release programs. This will allow your cosigner to be removed faster, which is always an added benefit. Important Considerations For BorrowersGiven that most private student loans require a cosigner, it's important that cosigners and borrowers know and understand what they are getting into. If the borrower can't pay the loan, the cosigner is fully responsible for the debt - and failure to pay could negatively harm both the borrower's and cosigner's credit.Also, if something were to happen to the borrower (such as death or disability), the cosigner is typically 100% responsible for the loan.That's why recommend that borrowers get term life insurance for the duration of the student loan - payable to the cosigner. The value of the policy should be the loan value plus interest. That way, if anything were to happen to the borrower, the cosigner is protected.Check out Bestow to get a quick quote online in about 5 minutes. You'll see that life insurance for college students is typically very cheap - and this can be a great way to protect your family should something happen. You don't want to be responsible for your cosigners loans.Private Loans vs. Income-Sharing AgreementsIncome-sharing agreements are becoming popular alternatives to student loans as a way to pay for college. Income-sharing agreements are tools where you can get money for college in exchange for repaying a portion of your income after graduation.There are limits to income-sharing - you typically have a minimum salary you need to achieve before you start repayment. Then, you only pay a certain percentage of your income, up to a certain amount. The goal is your repayment is based on how successful you are due to your education. You can find the Best ISAs here.Learn more about income-sharing agreements here.Frequently Asked Questions About Student LoansHere are some common questions people ask when thinking about private student loans:What's the difference between private and federal loans?Private loans are offered by independent banks and lenders, whereas federal loans are offered by the Department of Education.

Variable rates are usually \u0026#34;sexy\u0026#34; in that they are lower than fixed rates...today. However, variable rates can rise in the future if interest rates go up (they can also go down, but that\u0026#39;s very rare). Fixed rate loans charge the same interest rate over the life of the loan. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, should you get a fixed rate or variable rate student loan? For most private loans, you should go for a fixed rate loan. The reason is, we are in a rising interest rate environment. Rates will only rise in the future since we\u0026#39;re at historic lows today.

In fact, 90% of all private student loans have a cosigner. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe reason? Because private student loans act much more like car loans or mortgages - you need to have income, a high credit score, and more to qualify. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor most college students, they simply don\u0026#39;t have credit (yet), a high income (because they\u0026#39;re students), or an employment history (once again, because they\u0026#39;re students). That\u0026#39;s why most banks require a cosigner. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, banks and lenders have realized that cosigners don\u0026#39;t like to be cosigners, and they want to get off the loans as soon as possible - that\u0026#39;s where cosigner release comes into play. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCosigner release is a program offered by lenders where, after a specific number of on-time payments, the cosigner can be removed from the loan. Many banks offer cosigner release after 24-36 on-time payments.
