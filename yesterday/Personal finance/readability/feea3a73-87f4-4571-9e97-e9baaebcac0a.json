I’ve personally earned over $1,000 in free gift cards doing the methods listed in this article, so I know it is possible to get free gift cards! Best Ways To Get Free Sephora Gift Cards Here’s a quick list before we begin: Swagbucks Fetch Rewards Sephora’s Beauty Insider program Survey Junkie  MyPoints PrizeRebel Branded Surveys InboxDollars Five Surveys  Prime Opinion Capital One Shopping Below are the best ways to get a free Sephora gift card. I’ve received over 100 gift cards from Swagbucks, as you can see in this screenshot. 1. Swagbucks The Swagbucks platform is a free website where you can earn rewards for doing things online like taking surveys (there are currently over 20 surveys that I can take on Swagbucks, so plenty of ways to earn points!), watching videos, printing coupons, playing games (one game will pay me up to 101,920 points, which would be equal to a little over a $100 Sephora gift card), and shopping online. It’s easy to use and doesn’t cost anything to join. Once you have 1,000 SB (Swagbucks) points, you can trade them for free Sephora gift cards. 1,000 points is equal to a $10 Sephora gift card. Personally, I have earned over 110 free gift cards on Swagbucks, so I know this is real! Sign up for Swagbucks here (and earn $5 in free bonus points).

It’s super easy to use. Just take a picture of your receipt after you buy stuff. You can do this at grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations, and more. I use this app for all of my grocery receipts and I like that it is really quick to use. You get at least 25 points for each receipt you scan. Some certain items can earn you even more points, such as buying a box of cereal (for example, right now I have an offer to earn 2,500 points for buying a certain brand of cereal) or ice cream. Once you collect enough points, you can trade them for gift cards to Sephora in the amounts of $5, $10, $25, and $50. There are lots of options like Amazon, Target, and Starbucks. You can scan up to 35 receipts in a week, so there are plenty of chances to rack up points! Plus, you can earn points for shopping at Sephora through Fetch Rewards too. You can get around 20 points for every $1 spent at Sephora (check current rates, though, as this can change). You can sign up for Fetch Rewards by clicking here.

Sign up for Sephora’s Beauty Insider program Sephora’s Beauty Insider program is free to join and has great perks, especially if you do a lot of shopping at Sephora. You can earn points on your purchases and redeem them for rewards. The program has different tiers based on how much you spend each year. As you move up, you get better benefits. For example, the free plan (called “Insider”) is free to join and you can get $10 off for every 500 points you’ve earned. By signing up, you can also get shopping deals and Sephora coupons that aren’t open to the public. 4. Survey Junkie Survey Junkie is a fun way to get free Sephora gift cards. You can earn points by sharing your opinions on products and services. It’s easy to use and won’t take up too much of your time. You can sign up for free and start taking surveys right away. Most surveys take less than 30 minutes to finish. When you reach 500 points, you can trade them for a $5 Sephora gift card. The more surveys you do, the more points you’ll earn. Sign up for Survey Junkie here. Recommended reading: Survey Junkie Review 5. MyPoints MyPoints is a way to get free Sephora gift cards.

Branded Surveys Branded Surveys is a way to get free Sephora gift card codes by answering surveys. When you finish a survey, you earn points. Each survey usually takes about 5-20 minutes and you can make between 50 cents and $5 for each survey you do. Branded Surveys is open to people in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. You only need to be 16 years old to join, which is great for teenagers looking to make extra money online.

I currently have over 20 listed when I checked and they ranged from just a few minutes long to over 30 minutes long. For me, I have been paid for answering many surveys over the years. I simply answer them while watching TV or a movie, so they are very easy to do. You won’t get rich from surveys, but it’s a nice way to make some extra cash. You can get paid through PayPal, Venmo, or gift cards. They pay fast – sometimes in less than 2 minutes! Please click here to sign up for Prime Opinion and get up to a $5 free bonus (500 free bonus points). Recommended reading: Prime Opinion Review: How Much Does Prime Opinion Pay? 11.

If you’re a Beauty Insider member, you can pick up a special present during your birthday month. I know that this isn’t a free gift card to Sephora, but it is a way to get something for free from Sephora! Sephora gives different gift options each year. You might get makeup, skincare, fragrance, or hair products. The gifts are usually mini-sized, perfect for trying new things. To get your gift, you need to be a Sephora Beauty Insider, which is free to join! Once you’re a member, you can pick up your gift in-store at Sephora stores anytime during your birthday month. If you prefer to shop online, you can also get your gift there. But you’ll need to spend at least $25 to get it with your order.
