You can also shop online and get cash back. Swagbucks even lets you earn points for searching the web.

Fetch Rewards Fetch Rewards is an easy app where you can earn free Uber Eats gift cards. It’s super easy to use! All you need to do is take pictures of your receipts with your phone. I use Fetch Rewards for all of my grocery receipts, and I think it’s an easy app to use. You can scan receipts from almost any store. This includes grocery stores, gas stations, and even restaurants. Every time you scan a receipt, you earn points. Using Fetch Rewards is simple. Just shop like you normally do, then take a picture of your receipt when you’re done. The app does the rest! You can earn extra points by checking out special offers in the app. These offers can give you more points for buying certain items, like a specific brand of bread or soap. You can sign up for Fetch Rewards by clicking here. Recommended reading: Fetch Rewards Review 5. Ibotta Ibotta is a free app that can help you save money on groceries and other purchases. You can earn cash back on items you buy at many stores. It’s a lot like Fetch Rewards, and I personally like to use both of these apps on the same receipts (it gives you more chances to earn points!). Here’s how it works: Before you shop, check the Ibotta app for offers. Add the ones you want to your list. Then, go shopping as usual. After you’re done, take a picture of your receipt with the app. Ibotta will match your purchases to the offers you picked. You’ll get cash back for the items that match. You can then turn the points you’ve earned into free gift cards, such as to Uber Eats. You can sign up for Ibotta by clicking here. 6. Upside Upside is a free app that helps you save money on everyday purchases, such as gas for your car. With Upside, you can earn around 25 cents back per gallon of gas, and sometimes even up to 90 cents per gallon. Using the app is easy. Just sign up, find offers near you, and claim them before you buy gas. You can use Upside at many popular gas stations like BP, Shell, and Circle K. It also works at some grocery stores and restaurants. The app is available in most big cities across the U.S. When you’re ready to get your money, you can choose PayPal, a bank transfer, or gift cards. You can sign up for Upside by clicking here. 7. Survey Junkie Survey Junkie is a fun way to get free Uber Eats gift cards. You can share your thoughts and earn points at the same time. How does it work?
