The new Citi Strata Card has no annual fee and earns bonus rewards in a variety of top spending categories for many people. (It's different from the similarly named Citi Strata Premier℠ Card, which does charge an annual fee.)Image courtesy of CitiExisting holders of the Citi Rewards+® Card will automatically be moved to the Citi Strata card on July 20, 2025. Applications for new cardholders will open in late 2025. The reward rates on the Citi Strata are a major improvement over its predecessor. The Citi Rewards+® Card earns 2 ThankYou points per $1 spent at supermarkets and gas stations up to a combined annual spend of $6,000, and 1 ThankYou point per $1 on all other purchases. By comparison, the Citi Strata earns the following rewards:5x ThankYou points on hotels, car rentals and attractions booked on cititravel.com.3x ThankYou points at supermarkets.  3x ThankYou points on select transit and gas/EV stations.3x ThankYou points on an eligible self-select category of your choice including fitness clubs, select streaming services, live entertainment, cosmetic stores/barbershops/hair salons or pet supply stores.  2x ThankYou points at restaurants.  1x ThankYou points on all other purchases. The card also has a limited-time welcome offer for new cardholders: 30,000 ThankYou points after spending $1,000 within the first 3 months of account opening. One ThankYou point is worth 1 cent when redeemed for cash, so that welcome bonus is worth $300. Another new cardholder benefit is a 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months, then a variable APR 19.24%-29.24% will apply.Other redemption options include gift cards and a statement credit. ThankYou points earned with the Citi Strata may also be transferred to a few of Citi's travel partners: Choice Privileges, JetBlue and Wyndham Rewards. Citi has more travel partners beyond those three, but you need the Citi Strata Premier℠ Card or the Citi Prestige® Card to access them.Notably, some of the features that made the Citi Rewards+® Card unique — including its 10% points bonus on the first 100,000 points redeemed annually, and its automatic rewards \"roundup\" to the nearest 10 points on each purchase — will not be ongoing features of the new Citi Strata Card. However, those who opened a Citi Rewards+® Card between July 20, 2024, through July 19, 2025, will retain the points bonus and roundup feature until July 19, 2026, a Citi spokesperson confirmed.Information related to the Citi Rewards+® Card and the Citi Prestige® Card has been collected by NerdWallet and has not been reviewed or provided by the issuer of these products.",
