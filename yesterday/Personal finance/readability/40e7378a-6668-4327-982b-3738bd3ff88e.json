  "text": "Ever since I left my day job in 2012, I’ve used a form of the dumbbell investing strategy to grow my wealth while protecting against large losses. It’s a framework that’s helped me stay invested during uncertain times—especially when I felt the urge to hoard cash or sit on the sidelines. If you’re in a situation where you know you should take some risk, but you're also worried about losing money, the dumbbell investing strategy is worth considering. The dumbbell investing strategy involves allocating a roughly equal portion of your investable assets into high-risk, high-reward investments on one end, and low-risk, capital-preserving investments on the other. If you're operating with a 50/50 risk split—like I suggest in my post about when to stop taking excess risk—you’re already applying a version of the strategy. It’s especially useful when you're uncertain about the macroeconomic environment or your personal financial situation. Why I First Embraced the Dumbbell Strategy The most uncertain times in my life were: Graduating from college without a written job offer in finance (came a month later while I was traveling in Japan) Leaving my career at 34 and wondering whether I had made a huge mistake betting on myself Becoming a father in 2017 and questioning whether our passive income was truly enough to keep up with inflation Each time, I wanted to invest in my future and my family’s, but fear of loss made me hesitate. That’s why I turned to the dumbbell investing strategy after I retired and became a father. It gave me the psychological permission I needed to take action. Because the longer you sit on the sidelines avoiding risk, the more likely you are to fall behind. Note: When I started working at Goldman Sachs in July 1999, I felt like I had won the lottery and decided to invest 100% of my savings into stocks. With strong income potential and modest expenses, going risk-on seemed appropriate. But I quickly received a rude awakening when the dot-com bubble began to burst on March 10, 2000. The NASDAQ would bottom on October 9, 2002, down 78%, and it wouldn’t fully recover until April 24, 2015—a long 15-year wait just to get back to even. Why I’m Deploying the Dumbbell Strategy Again in 2025 Today, I’m more financially secure than in the past. But I’m also a lifelong investor, and right now the market gives me pause. Between tariffs, new legislation, stretched valuations, elevated interest rates, and AI hype cycles, I’m not rushing to load up on the S\u0026P 500 at 22X forward earnings. Still, I believe in dollar-cost averaging and that the market will be higher over time. But when uncertainty is high, the temptation to hoard cash increases. The problem? By the time certainty returns, the easy gains have often already been made. Take the March–April 2025 tariff-induced selloff. If you waited for resolution, instead of buying the dip during the period of most uncertainty, you would’ve missed out on a 20%+ rebound. The best returns tend to go to those who act when others are frozen. This is why, rather than stop investing, I’m leaning on the dumbbell strategy again. The Conservative End of My Dumbbell As the person responsible for our family’s financial well-being, I feel constant pressure to deliver a good-enough lifestyle, if not a great lifestyle. Every dollar saved or invested in risk-free income is a step closer to peace of mind. My ultimate goal is to generate $380,000 in gross passive income a year, up from about $320,000 currently. That $60,000 gap is what I’m methodically trying to close by the end of 2027. Once achieved, I will deem us financially independent once more. With Treasury yields still above 4%, I saw an opportunity to lock in solid returns with no risk. So I deployed capital into a mix of short-term and longer-duration government bonds. On one end of my dumbbell, I purchased: $100,993.74 in 3-month Treasury bills yielding ~4.4% These will mature soon, and I’ll continue to roll them into similar duration or longer-term bonds, depending on interest rate trends Over the next 12 months, this position alone will generate roughly $4,400 in risk-free passive income, reducing my annual deficit to about $53,600. Passive income progress feels wonderful! The Aggressive End Of My Dumbbell Now that I’ve shored up the conservative end of my dumbbell investing strategy, it’s time to swing to the aggressive side. I could simply invest another $100,000 into the S\u0026P 500, which I normally allocate around 70% of my public equity exposure to. But the S\u0026P 500 feels expensive today, and I’m already heavily invested. Instead, I want to put capital toward what I’m both most interested in—and most concerned about: artificial intelligence. AI is already disrupting the job market, and my biggest worry is that it will make spending a fortune on college an increasingly poor financial decision. Entry-level jobs are at the highest risk of being automated or eliminated. As a parent of two young children (8 and 5), this concern weighs heavily on my mind. To hedge against a potentially difficult employment future for them, I feel it’s imperative to invest in the very technology that might harm their prospects. Ideally, they’ll learn how to harness AI to boost their productivity, or even join an AI company and build wealth of their own. But those outcomes are uncertain. What I can do now is invest directly in the AI revolution on their behalf. Investing In Artificial Intelligence As a result, I’ve invested another $100,000 in Fundrise Venture, which holds positions in leading AI companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Databricks, and Anduril. If AI ends up eating the world, I want to make sure they have a seat at the table—at least financially. I'm also investing additional capital through closed-end venture capital funds as they call capital. My hope is that owning a basket of private AI companies will compound at a much faster rate than the S\u0026P 500, given these companies are growing much faster. But of course, there are no guarantees. The Dumbbell Investment Strategy Is Best for Deploying New Cash The dumbbell investing strategy made it easy for me to reinvest a little over $200,000 in cash from my home sale. Allocating $100,000 into T-bills gives me peace of mind that, no matter how bad the economy or markets get, at least half of my investment is completely safe and earning risk-free interest. Meanwhile, if AI mania continues, I have $100,000 positioned to ride the wave higher. Both allocations make me feel good—and how you feel about your investments matters. The more confident you are, the more likely you'll stay invested and keep building wealth by investing more regularly. That’s why, if I receive another influx of cash or want to redeploy existing funds, I’ll likely continue growing this dumbbell strategy. The dumbbell approach works best when you have new money to invest or idle cash sitting around during uncertain times. However, rebalancing an existing portfolio into a 50/50 split between risk-free and risk assets is a different matter. Your broader asset allocation should reflect your age and stage in life. A 50/50 allocation might be appropriate, but large rebalancing moves can trigger tax consequences you must consider carefully. Example Of Using The Dumbbell Strategy To Get To An Ideal Overall Net Worth Allocation For example, suppose I already have a $1 million investment portfolio and inherit $200,000 in cash, bringing my net worth to $1.2 million. At 38 years old with 15 more years of planned work ahead, I’m comfortable taking more risk. I’d be fine investing 90% of my net worth ($1,080,000) in risk assets and starting a side business to pursue growth opportunities. If my original portfolio consisted of $980,000 in risk assets and $20,000 in cash and bonds, I could easily apply the dumbbell strategy by allocating $100,000 of the new cash to municipal bonds and $100,000 to stocks. This would bring my total to $1,080,000 (90%) in risk assets and $120,000 (10%) in risk-free investments—perfectly aligning with my ideal 90/10 allocation. A Simple Investing Framework for Peace of Mind and Growth The dumbbell investing strategy offers a clear and practical way to deploy new cash, especially during times of uncertainty. By allocating capital to both low-risk and high-risk assets, you gain the emotional reassurance of safety while maintaining exposure to upside potential. It’s a flexible approach that can be tailored to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and stage in life. Whether you're investing an inheritance, reallocating proceeds from a home sale, or simply sitting on excess cash, the dumbbell strategy provides structure without sacrificing opportunity. Best of all, it helps you stay motivated and confident—two essential ingredients for long-term investing success. So the next time you find yourself with idle cash and decision paralysis, consider the dumbbell approach. You just might sleep better at night while still building wealth during the day. Readers, have you ever considered using the dumbbell investing strategy during times of uncertainty? What potential flaws or additional benefits do you see with this approach? I’d love to hear your thoughts. Balance Risk and Reward With a Free Financial Check-Up If you’re sitting on new cash or reevaluating your portfolio during uncertain times, a second opinion can make all the difference. One smart move is to get a free financial check-up from a seasoned Empower financial advisor. Whether you have $100,000 or more in taxable accounts, savings, IRAs, or a 401(k), an Empower advisor can help you spot hidden fees, unbalanced allocations, or overlooked opportunities to improve your risk-adjusted returns. It’s a no-obligation way to stress-test your current strategy—whether you're building a dumbbell portfolio or considering a full rebalance. Clarity brings confidence. And when it comes to investing, confidence helps you stay the course.

Diversify Beyond Stocks and Bonds A classic dumbbell strategy includes bonds and equities—but don't forget about real estate. I like to treat real estate as a hybrid: it offers the income stability of bonds with the potential appreciation of stocks. I’ve invested over $400,000 with Fundrise, a platform that allows you to passively invest in diversified portfolios of residential and industrial properties—many in the high-growth Sunbelt region. With over $3 billion in assets under management and a low $10 minimum, Fundrise has been a core part of my investment strategy, especially when I’ve had cash to redeploy. Fundrise also offers Venture, giving you access to private AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Databricks. As mentioned earlier, I’m heavily focused on AI's transformative potential and want exposure not just for returns—but for my kids’ future too. With a dumbbell strategy, it’s not just about balance—it’s about positioning yourself for both security and growth.

A 50/50 allocation might be appropriate, but large rebalancing moves can trigger tax consequences you must consider carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"h-example-of-using-the-dumbbell-strategy-to-get-to-an-ideal-overall-net-worth-allocation\"\u003eExample Of Using The Dumbbell Strategy To Get To An Ideal Overall Net Worth Allocation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, suppose I already have a $1 million investment portfolio and inherit $200,000 in cash, bringing my net worth to $1.2 million. At 38 years old with 15 more years of planned work ahead, I’m comfortable taking more risk. I’d be fine investing 90% of my net worth ($1,080,000) in risk assets and starting a side business to pursue growth opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf my original portfolio consisted of $980,000 in risk assets and $20,000 in cash and bonds, I could easily apply the dumbbell strategy by allocating $100,000 of the new cash to municipal bonds and $100,000 to stocks. This would bring my total to $1,080,000 (90%) in risk assets and $120,000 (10%) in risk-free investments—perfectly aligning with my ideal 90/10 allocation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"h-a-simple-investing-framework-for-peace-of-mind-and-growth\"\u003eA Simple Investing Framework for Peace of Mind and Growth\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe dumbbell investing strategy offers a clear and practical way to deploy new cash, especially during times of uncertainty. By allocating capital to both low-risk and high-risk assets, you gain the emotional reassurance of safety while maintaining exposure to upside potential. It’s a flexible approach that can be tailored to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and stage in life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhether you\u0026#39;re investing an inheritance, reallocating proceeds from a home sale, or simply sitting on excess cash, the dumbbell strategy provides structure without sacrificing opportunity. Best of all, it helps you stay motivated and confident—two essential ingredients for long-term investing success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo the next time you find yourself with idle cash and decision paralysis, consider the dumbbell approach. You just might sleep better at night while still building wealth during the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eReaders, have you ever considered using the dumbbell investing strategy during times of uncertainty?
