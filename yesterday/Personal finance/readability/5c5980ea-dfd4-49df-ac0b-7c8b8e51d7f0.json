On April 9, 2025, the MSC World America set sail on its inaugural trip from Miami to the Caribbean. It’s one of the 10 largest cruise ships in the world. Designed with families in mind, it features kid-friendly activities like waterslides, a ropes course and a ride that swings you over the sea. I previewed the ship on the invite-only inaugural sailing, a celebratory voyage that wasn’t open to the general public but that included media and travel agents. These preview sailings are different from a standard passenger voyage; some parts of the cruise weren’t yet operational. Still, I got a strong sense of what passengers could expect. Although MSC covered the cost of my trip, the opinions in this review are my own.Although much of the food served on the ship was just so-so and service was sometimes slow, the ship's impressive lineup of rides and entertainment made it a good option for those looking for a family cruise.Booking and check-inMSC Cruises’ brand-new PortMiami terminal is now the largest in the world.(Photo by Sally French)Embarkation took place at MSC Cruises’ brand-new PortMiami terminal, which opened in April and is now the largest cruise terminal in the world. Despite the size of both the terminal and the ship itself, check-in was the smoothest and fastest experience I’ve had on any cruise. That’s largely due to the terminal’s high-tech design.I checked in ahead of time online via the MSC for Me app (you could also pre-check in via the MSC Cruises website). Then, I uploaded my travel documents, like my passport information, and immediately received a boarding pass, which I loaded onto my Apple Wallet.MSC Cruises’ brand-new PortMiami terminal is now the largest in the world. (Photo by Sally French)I had a rideshare drop me off in a covered drop-off zone at the terminal, which was just a quick walk to the main entrance. People who are driving themselves can park in the six-level garage, which has more than 2,400 spaces that can be reserved in advance through the MSC for Me app or website. I didn’t check any bags myself; as the creator of the 10-$10 rule, I’m a fanatic about packing light. But if you have luggage, you can scan your boarding pass and leave your bags at one of the drop-off points in the parking garage to have them delivered to your room.MSC Cruises’ brand-new PortMiami terminal is now the largest in the world.(Photo by Sally French)The biometric check-in process, which I opted into, was straightforward. I scanned my passport and had my photo taken by a camera that used facial recognition to validate my identity. I didn’t need to whip out my passport at any point after that. Even when going on and off the ship during port days, I just scanned a ship-issued cruise badge.The cruise terminal, which overlooks Biscayne Bay, is huge and filled with natural light. It didn’t feel cramped and stuffy like some terminals.Guests of the MSC Yacht Club, the cruise line's luxury \"ship-within-a-ship\" concept (more on that later), have access to a private lounge where they can nosh on premium drinks and snacks while they wait.MSC World America first impressionsMSC World America's World Promenade. (Photo by Sally French)MSC World America is a behemoth of a ship: 22 decks high, more than 1,000 feet long and enough space to hold nearly 7,000 guests and more than 2,000 crew members. It has 19 dining venues, and multiple bars, lounges, shops and pools. Onboard, you can walk along the World Promenade, a massive outdoor space with restaurants and bars. Large pillars designed to resemble palm trees light up at night. In the center, there's an enormous spiral slide that drops 11 floors, which riders can enter on Deck 20.From the moment you board, it’s clear this ship is meant to impress. There are seven themed “districts,” each designed for various travelers:Aqua Deck.Family Aventura.Galleria.MSC Yacht Club.Promenade.The Terraces.Zen Area.Exploring the ship feels like a choose-your-own-adventure experience. Getting lost is part of the fun. It’s also inevitable.The cabins: Compact but blandA balcony room on the MSC World America. (Photo by Sally French)MSC World America's cabins are uninspiring compared to the flashier parts of the ship, but make good use of space. Shelves and drawers are tucked in everywhere — along the bathroom walls, underneath the nightstand and surrounding the vanity. Standard rooms have a bland, brown color palette. The sand I might have tracked into the room from the beach blended right into the floor (oops).I stayed in a standard balcony room, but I had the chance to tour several other cabin types, which range from basic to downright luxurious.My balcony cabinA Deluxe Balcony stateroom on the MSC World America. (Photo by Sally French)MSC put me in a Deluxe Balcony stateroom with a king-sized bed and 183 square feet of interior space, plus a private outdoor area. The balcony had enough space for two chairs and a small table — perfect for sipping coffee while enjoying an ocean view.Storage was plentiful: I had a split closet with both hangers and shelves, deep drawers, and built-in cubbies in the nightstands. I appreciated the thoughtful layout, although there weren't many power outlets near the bed. I plugged my phone into one of the many outlets near the vanity instead.MSC covered the cost of my room, but normally, these cabins typically start at about $2,000 for two adults in the room for a seven-night sailing out of Miami around the Caribbean. That’s a base fare that includes most food and activities, but there are add-on costs for certain experiences, specialty meals, Wi-Fi and alcohol. And of course, prices vary based on demand. Studio interior: A simple, affordable option for solo travelersAn interior room onboard the MSC World America. (Photo by Sally French) For guests cruising solo, the Studio Interior stateroom is a good option. At just 118 square feet, it’s compact and has no windows. It’s ideal if you’re planning to spend most of your time enjoying the ship and not much time in your room. These rooms start at about $1,000 per person for a seven-night sailing out of Miami.Grand Suite Aurea: My personal favoriteThe Grand Suite Aurea onboard the MSC World America. (Photo by Sally French)Among all the rooms I visited, the Grand Suite Aurea might be the one I’d book for myself next time — but only if I could find a good deal on it. It had a starting price of about $4,000 for two people for a seven-night sailing out of Miami.This Grand Suite Aurea has its own private hot tub. (Photo by Sally French)The Grand Suite Aurea I visited had an expansive terrace and a private hot tub overlooking the ocean. Soaking in a bubbling tub while staring at the open sea was a vibe I could get behind.MSC Yacht Club: Elevated cruising with exclusive vibesWhile I didn’t personally stay in the MSC Yacht Club, I was intrigued by this “ship-within-a-ship” concept. It's a feature also found on other cruise lines, including Norwegian Cruise Line and Princess Cruises.To be clear, MSC Yacht Club has nothing to do with yachts. That’s just the name given to this cabin class designed for guests seeking an ultra-premium experience. The Yacht Club offers keycard-only access to private lounges, restaurants, a dedicated sun deck with a pool and hot tubs, 24-hour butler service and a concierge.Think of it as a hotel room with Club-level access. Benefits of booking an MSC Yacht Club fare include nicer rooms with upgraded finishes and access to some exclusive spaces, like a private pool. The MSC Yacht Club Deluxe Suite accommodates up to four guests. There's a Nespresso machine inside the room, plus daily turndown chocolates from Venchi, a high-end Italian chocolatier.The Yacht Club Duplex Suite spans two decks. (Photo by Sally French)For even more space and drama, the Yacht Club Duplex Suite comfortably sleeps four, measuring 495 square feet and spanning two decks. The lower level includes a living and dining area, plus a full bathroom. Upstairs, the master bedroom offers a second bathroom with a bathtub. The floor-to-ceiling windows and balcony views give the whole space a grand, open feel.The price is steep though. Expect to pay prices starting at about $7,000 for two adults on a seven-night sailing out of Miami.Dining: A mixed bagTreats at Sweet Temptations. (Photo by Sally French)With 19 dining options, there’s no shortage of variety aboard MSC World America. The line offers a mix of American comfort foods and international flavors (mostly European). For the most part, food quality was good but not great. The food included with the cruise fare — such as the buffets — resembled college dorm food, without much spice or flavor. It was all tasty, but hardly the foodie heaven that other competitors offer. The specialty restaurants, which cost extra, had better options.Included restaurantsLuna Park Pizza \u0026 Burger in a restaurant onboard the MSC World America. Other than the soda and alcohol, everything served here is included with your cruise fare. (Photo by Sally French)Among the restaurants included in your cruise fare, Luna Park Pizza \u0026 Burger was one of the better options. The food wasn't notable (think chili dogs, chicken wings, burgers, fries and nachos) but I loved the old-school diner vibes, with its retro neon-light wall art and comfy booths.Food from one of the buffets on the MSC World America. (Photo by Sally French)The ship also has two buffets with the usual mix of food. There’s a salad bar, kids section, and tons of American fare like pizza and burgers. There was also a good amount of European flair, with an extensive antipasti section. Breakfast at the buffet. (Photo by Sally French)I also appreciated many of the health-conscious options in the buffet, like the kale and sweet potato bowl I had for breakfast.An apple \"donut\" in one of the main buffets. (Photo by Sally French)Even the dessert section offered healthy options. That, pictured above, is a healthy donut. Yes, instead of fried dough, that’s an apple slice under the frosting.Desserts at the buffet on the MSC World America. (Photo by Sally French)Don’t worry though. There are real donuts, too.The most disappointing part of the whole cruise was the main dining room, the Hexagon, where I had dinner each night of my three-night sailing. I should have left after the first night, but I went back two more nights to see if anything would improve. Surf and turf from the main dining hall, included with your cruise fare. (Photo by Sally French)On the first night, it took more than an hour for our entrees to arrive. We opted to skip the dessert we ordered just to get out of there. Our neighboring table, which had been seated before us, still hadn’t received their meals by the time we left. It felt frustrating rather than leisurely.On all three nights, it was so loud that I could barely hear my tablemates. And I’m the person who is always cold, but this restaurant was stuffy and hot.Specialty restaurantsMSC World America, houses the only Eataly restaurant at sea.The cruise's specialty restaurants — which cost extra — offered much higher quality dishes compared to the options included in the cruise fare. Eataly at Sea, an Italian market and restaurant, features made-from-scratch pasta, fresh burrata and thoughtfully sourced ingredients. It even has a wall of fresh basil growing, a delightful touch. Butcher’s Cut, a steakhouse, served one of the best steaks I’ve had on a cruise. Sweet Temptations serves over-the-top desserts onboard the MSC World America. (Photo by Sally French)Sweet Temptations, a gelato, crepe and milkshake shop, offered several over-the-top, photo-worthy dessert creations.BarsAlcoholic drinks can be purchased on the cruise with an add-on package or individually. For me, The Gin Project was the most memorable bar on the ship. It offered 20 craft gins, and you could design your own gin and tonic from a mix of ingredients.The best boozy drink I had wasn’t at a bar, but rather at the Coffee Emporium. It’s designed as a modern coffee house for coffee connoisseurs with French, Italian, Turkish and Moroccan-style coffee. The Coffee Emporium on the MSC World America. (Photo by Sally French)I ordered a Lavazza Colada, which combined rum, pineapple juice, coconut syrup and espresso. The presentation wasn’t great, but it was surprisingly refreshing.Entertainment: Top-tier live showsA live performance of Queen Symphonic onboard the MSC World America. (Photo by Sally French)MSC World America's entertainment lineup is basically nonstop. My favorite show was Queen Symphonic, where performers sang and danced to Queen's greatest hits in a theater.There's also Dirty Dancing in Concert, a high-energy performance with singers, dancers and a band performing hits from the movie.Although it wasn’t ready for my preview sailing, I’m eager to see Odyssey, which promises to be an “acrobatic spectacle set against the dreamlike backdrop of an ethereal journey influenced by Homer’s 'Odyssey.'”The Comedy Club in The Terraces district also offers an almost constant stream of entertainment, including dueling pianos, stand-up sets and karaoke nights.Kids attractionsA Lego play area. (Photo by Sally French)The Family Aventura district is packed with activities. There's a Lego-building area where adults and kids can build to their hearts' content. There's also a Lego Parade, where costumed characters march through the ship.A Lego parade on the MSC World America. (Photo by Sally French)For an extra fee per game, you can play at the arcade. The water park features multiple slides, including ones for older kids and tweens. You can also try the Cliffhanger, an over-water swing ride. It’s thrilling, a little terrifying and a must-try for adrenaline junkies (grown-ups included).The ropes course is also fun — but keep in mind that it might not be a good choice for younger kids. It’s surprisingly scary even if you don’t typically have a fear of heights. Attractions for adultsBotanic Garden poolThe Botanic Garden pool. (Photo by Sally French)Located in the adults-only Zen Area at the rear of the ship, the Botanic Garden Pool is a peaceful, climate-controlled retreat. A retractable glass roof protects the area from wind and rain. With greenery, loungers and a spa-like atmosphere, it felt like a secret garden tucked away from the main pool decks.The gymMSC World America has the best cruise ship gym I've ever visited. (Photo by Sally French)MSC knocked it out of the park with the fitness center. Most cruise ship gyms are fine for some bicep curls, but this one is great. It has two full squat racks, which is a unicorn find in cruise or hotel gyms. There are also several free weights, cable machines and cardio gear with ocean views. Ocean Cay: MSC’s private islandThe lighthouse at Ocean Cay MSC Marine Reserve, which is MSC Cruises' private island. (Photo by Sally French)This sailing included a stop at Ocean Cay MSC Marine Reserve, MSC’s private island in the Bahamas. We arrived in the evening and stayed overnight, giving us a chance to enjoy a nighttime lighthouse show and beach party.Ocean Cay MSC Marine Reserve is MSC Cruises' private island. (Photo by Sally French)Ocean Cay isn’t huge. It’s possible to walk around the whole island in one go (if you’re a serious stepper like me, that is). But there’s space for everyone to spread out along the beach. For kids or non-swimmers, there's a protected inlet with calmer waters.MSC: Is it worth it?Ocean Cay MSC Marine Reserve is MSC Cruises' private island. (Photo by Sally French)From the family-friendly Lego zones to the adults-only Zen area, the MSC World America offers an incredible variety of experiences — and for the most part, delivers.Is it perfect? Not quite. Some service hiccups need to be ironed out. The food wasn’t notable, but it felt well-suited for families with kids who would prefer French fries and pizza over to other options. Overall, the ship's rides and other attractions could easily add up to a great vacation.How to maximize your rewards",
