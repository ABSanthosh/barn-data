Ever feel like you’re just trying to keep up, but everything still feels like chaos? I’ve been there too. There was a time in my life when I felt overwhelmed (and that’s normal!) – my finances were a mess, my schedule was all over the place, and I didn’t have clear goals. I knew I needed a change, but I wasn’t sure where to start. Over the years, I’ve learned that getting your life together isn’t about being perfect – it’s about making small, intentional changes that add up over time. And the best part? You don’t have to do it all at once. If you’re feeling stuck, don’t worry – I’ve put together a list of simple, actionable steps to help you take control of your life and create a future you’re excited about. Remember, everyone’s journey is different, so focus on what works best for you. Recommended reading: 12 Simple Habits for Living a Happy Life Best Ways To Get Your Life Together Here’s my how-to-get-your-life-together checklist. 1. Set clear goals Getting your life together starts with setting clear goals – both short-term and long-term goals. Think about what you really want. What does success look like for you? Write it down. Big dreams can feel scary. I recommend that you break them into smaller steps you can do each day, week, or month. This makes them less scary and more doable. For example, instead of saying that you want to save $10,000 this year, you can say “My goal is to save $834 each month.” And, keep your goals where you can see them. Put them on your fridge or in a journal you look at a lot because this helps you stay focused and motivated. For example, you can make a vision board where you cut out pictures that show your goals and stick them on a board; then put this on your fridge or on your hallway mirror (or a place where you look often!). You can find vision board supplies on Amazon here. 2. Organize your living space Take a look around your home. Is it messy? A tidy space can help you feel more in control of your life. Here are some tips for getting started: Clean up your bedroom and declutter. Put away clothes, throw out things you don’t need, and make your bed each morning to start the day right. Tackle your work area. Clear off your desk, only keep items you use often, and put pens, papers, and other supplies in containers. Organize common areas like the living room and kitchen. Find a spot for everything and put things back when you’re done using them. Try going digital with some of your stuff. Scan important papers and save them on your computer. This can free up a lot of space. Use labels to mark where things go. This makes it easier to put items away and find them later. You can use a label maker, just write on tape, or buy premade labels on Amazon. Get in the habit of tidying up for a few minutes each day. This keeps messes from piling up. You’ll feel better coming home to a clean space. 3. Create a daily routine Making a daily routine can help you get your life in order. Here are some tips to make a good daily routine: Wake up at the same time each day Limit screen time in the morning Create a meal plan for the week Have a to-do list Set specific times for checking emails Start small with your routine. Pick one or two things to do each day. As you get used to it, you can add more. Remember, your routine should work for you, so there’s no one daily routine checklist that will work for everyone.

Make a budget plan If you want to learn how to get your life together financially, then I highly recommend making a budget. Making a budget is an important step to getting your life in order, and this is because it can help you stop overspending, realize where you need to cut back, and learn how to manage your money better. You can start by listing your monthly income and expenses (grab a piece of paper or you can do this on your computer – it doesn’t have to be difficult!). This gives you a clear picture of where your money goes. I recommend that you track your spending for a month where you write down every purchase, big or small. You’ll most likely be surprised at what you find and how much you spend. Some of my favorite books that will help you manage your money better include: The Simple Path To Wealth, Broke Millennial, and The One Week Budget. 5. Prioritize self care and your health Taking care of yourself is important for getting your life on track. You need to focus on both your body and mind to feel your best. Some things you may want to try include: Eat foods that give you energy, like fruits and vegetables, as well as a balanced diet. Get moving every day, even if it’s just a short walk. Get 7-9 hours of sleep each night (set a bedtime and stick to it). Go to doctor visits. Go for checkups and take care of any health issues right away. Find ways to relax and lower stress, like deep breathing, yoga, or just taking quiet time for yourself. Try out hobbies that you think you may enjoy doing, like watercolor painting or hiking. Think more positively and try to get rid of negative thoughts. And, if you need to talk to someone, don’t be afraid to find a therapist or get other professional help.

Start a daily journal Writing in a journal every day can help you get your life together, and it’s a simple way to track your thoughts and feelings. You can start by getting a notebook or using an app on your phone (although, I do think getting a physical book is probably better for most, so that you can spend less time on your phone). Then, pick a time each day to write, like right after you wake up or before bed. You can write about things like what happened during your day, your goals and dreams, what has given you fulfillment lately, what you’re grateful for (you could even start a gratitude journal!), and more. Looking back at old entries can show you how much you’ve grown. It’s a great way to see your progress as you work on getting your life together. You can find journals on Amazon here. 7. Manage your time better For me, one of the things I did that helped a lot with getting my life together was finding ways to better manage my time. There are so many little time sucks throughout the day that can really prevent you from reaching your goals! Getting your life together means making the most of your time. Here are some tips: Start by using tools like calendars or planners to keep track of your tasks and appointments. Try time blocking, where you set aside specific hours for different activities. This can help you stay focused and get more done. Avoid doing multiple things at once. Instead, give your full attention to one task at a time. You’ll finish faster and do a better job. Set clear limits on your time. Learn to say no to things that aren’t important. This helps protect your schedule from unnecessary distractions. Make a daily to-do list and stick to it. Put the most important tasks first. Cross things off as you finish them – it feels great! Take short breaks between tasks to recharge. Even a few minutes can help you stay fresh and productive throughout the day. For me, I really like to go on a walk after a few hours of working. It’s a nice way to break apart the day and to clear my head. Try to wake up a little bit earlier. This gives you extra time in the morning to prepare for your day without rushing. 8. Exercise regularly Adding regular exercise to your routine can make a big difference in your life. It’s not just about looking good – it’s about feeling good too! You don’t need to spend hours at the gym every day. You can start small with just 15-30 minutes of activity, like a quick walk around your neighborhood or a short yoga video at home. A way to make it fun is to find activities you enjoy. Maybe you like dancing, swimming, or playing a sport. When you have fun, you’re more likely to keep it up. One thing I am trying to do is to get a minimum of 10,000 steps in each day. I use an affordable step tracker, such as one of these. I bought a pedometer because I did not want to be connected to my phone any more than I already am. 9. Read personal development books Reading personal development books can help you get your life together because these books can give you advice and tips to improve yourself and even improve your mental well-being. Here are some popular personal development books to read: Atomic Habits The Psychology of Money Get Out of Your Head: Stopping the Spiral of Toxic Thoughts You can find self-help books on many subjects like money, relationships, and health. You can pick topics that interest you or areas where you want to grow. Try reading one self-help book each month and take notes on the main ideas that you learn about. Then put those ideas into practice in your daily life. You might be surprised how much you can learn and grow. 10. Limit screen time Cutting back on screen time can help you get your life in order. Too much time on phones and computers can eat up your day. The average person spends hours upon hours each day watching TV or scrolling on their phone. This time could be used for anything else – such as spending time with friends and family, going outside for a walk, cooking a yummy meal, increasing your income, or learning something new. Some ways to reduce screen time include: When you’re with friends, put your phones away. This lets you enjoy each other’s company more. Going outside is a great way to reduce screen time. Take a walk in the park or ride your bike. Try playing board games instead of video games. Cooking is another screen-free activity to try. Learn a new recipe or teach your kids how to make something simple. Remember, it’s okay to be bored sometimes. When you’re not looking at a screen, your mind can wander and come up with new ideas. This can lead to creativity and problem-solving.
