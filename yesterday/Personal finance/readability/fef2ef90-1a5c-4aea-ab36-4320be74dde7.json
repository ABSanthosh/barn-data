  "text": "Executive Summary Retirement has long been associated with leisure, relaxation, and winding down from a long career. But as more individuals confront the emotional realities of this life transition, many find that the absence of structure, socialization, and identity once provided by work can create a gap that traditional retirement planning doesn't fully address. In this guest post, Kathleen Rehl, a \"ReFired\" financial advisor and educator in legacy planning, shares a framework to help advisors guide clients through this transition using a more expansive \"ReFirement\" lens. Drawing from her own encore career and decades of client experience, Kathleen illustrates how retirement can be reframed not as an end, but as a beginning – one centered on fulfillment, self-exploration, and purpose. While the core elements of traditional retirement planning remain (e.g., income streams, cash flow, and lifestyle support), ReFirement builds on this foundation to explore evolving values and aspirations, with the goal of living more intentionally. Yet even clients who are financially prepared may feel anxious or uncertain about what comes next. ReFirement addresses these concerns by blending financial planning with conversations that create space for safe, reflective exploration. Instead of viewing retirement as a retreat from productivity, clients are invited to see it as a launchpad for creativity, contribution, and personal growth. For many, this phase brings a complex emotional landscape – including grief, identity shifts, or even a lingering sense of disconnection – which can be difficult to process without thoughtful support. To help clients move forward, advisors can introduce practical tools that invite personal reflection and visualization. These include growth mindset prompts, values exercises, and legacy planning templates designed to help clients clarify what matters most. For example, visual activities like the \"Touchstone Poster\" or a guided values-ranking worksheet can help clients reconnect with forgotten passions or explore new aspirations. Whether they're exploring mentorship opportunities, creative outlets, or philanthropic goals, many clients find surprising clarity simply by having the space to reflect. Importantly, advisors don't have to guide this process alone – resources from organizations such as the Financial Transitionist Institute (FTI), Money Quotient, and George Kinder's EVOKE Process offer structure to support more meaningful planning conversations. Kathleen also shares a checklist of open-ended prompts that can serve as a roadmmap to help clients envision what a \"ReFired\" retirement might look like. Ultimately, the key point is that ReFirement offers a richer, more expansive vision for what retirement can be – not just a phase of rest, but a new opportunity for growth, contribution, and renewal. By helping clients align their financial strategies with their evolving values and aspirations, advisors can create space for deeper conversations and more rewarding outcomes. And in doing so, they don't just prepare clients for what's next; they empower them to step into it with clarity and confidence, and a renewed sense of purpose and joy! Kathleen Rehl owned Rehl Financial Advisors for 18 years before retiring to an active 6-year encore career empowering widows with her speaking, writing, and research. As a financial planner, she specialized in working with widows and philanthropic planning. After her husband died, Kathleen wrote Moving Forward on Your Own: A Financial Guidebook for Widows. Now in her 79th year, she’s happily reFired. That’s not traditional retirement as she pens legacy stories and poems. Plus, she assists nonprofits to grow their endowments. Returning to her love of teaching, Kathleen is an adjunct faculty at The American College of Financial Services in their Chartered Advisor in Philanthropy® program. She recently completed INELDA training as an end-of-life doula. Years ago, Kathleen served as a gift planning officer and, before that, as a university professor. Publications such as the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Next Avenue, Kiplinger’s, CNBC, Humble Dollar, Sixty \u0026 Me, AgeBuzz, and Rethinking65 have featured her work. Kathleen is an author, educator, mentor, and storyteller dedicated to empowering widows financially while inspiring legacy and longevity planning. A zesty Boomer practicing positive aging, Kathleen gratefully continues to create and contribute… joyfully using her skills and experiences to encourage others to live their best life. Read more of Kathleen’s articles here. Retirement today isn't just about leaving the workforce; it's a complex life transition that can stir deep questions about identity, direction, and meaning. As a result, the traditional model of retirement planning is becoming increasingly inadequate, especially when it fails to account for the emotional weight of transitions that shake a person's sense of self. Consider the case of a prominent 69-year-old medical director whose career pinnacle abruptly dissolved, leaving him adrift in a sea of bitterness and uncertainty. A concerned friend shared his story, revealing a stark reality: Retirement is about far more than finances and leisure. It also encompasses individuality, purpose, connection, and fulfillment. This paradigm shift calls upon financial advisors to reimagine their approach to retirement planning, integrating a deeper understanding of clients' holistic needs beyond financial security alone. Research underscores that true well-being in later life involves more than lavish lifestyles and financial abundance. Advisors who embrace this mindset can enhance client relationships by guiding them into an authentic next chapter – \"ReFirement\" – rather than traditional retirement. I first encountered the term \"ReFirement\" in \"The ReFirement Workbook\" by James Gambone, Erica Whitlinger, and Debby Magnuson, which was adopted to help retiring clergy adopt a holistic approach that extended beyond finances. Ken Blanchard and Morton Shaevitz later popularized the concept in their 2015 book \"Refire! Don't Retire: Make the Rest of Your Life the Best of Your Life\". Although the idea didn't seem to gain traction in the financial planning community, I readily recognized its core principles as useful for my clients, and, later, in my own life. ReFirement blends elements of retirement with renewed intention, passion, and personal growth. It represents a phase of life where individuals actively pursue their interests, engage in enriching activities, and find satisfaction beyond traditional notions of retirement. ReFirement emphasizes the importance of maintaining a sense of meaning, identity, and connection in later years, often involving continued learning, community involvement, and pursuing passions that may have been set aside during one's career-focused years. It's about redefining retirement as a time of vibrant engagement and personal enrichment rather than simply a period of leisure and relaxation. My ReFirement Journey After varied careers – including roles as a public-school teacher, university professor, nonprofit development officer, and CFP professional – I faced a profound loss with the death of my husband. Rather than retreating into traditional retirement at 67, I embraced the concept of ReFirement. This meant pivoting to a rewarding encore career focused on empowering widows financially through writing, speaking, research, and mentoring. Over the next six years, I wrote or was quoted in more than 150 published articles and gave nearly 300 presentations, mainly dedicated to helping widows and the advisors who served them. But as the world changed, so did my path. I took a short sabbatical to broaden my focus and found renewed direction in assisting nonprofits to build endowments, which I now do regularly. ReFirement also opened the door to new passions. I joined a local choir, enrolled in memoir and poetry writing classes, and was invited to join the adjunct faculty at The American College of Financial Services, where I still teach. I've even trained as an End-of-Life Doula and plan to volunteer with hospice later this year. These diverse pursuits reflect how ReFirement has allowed me to embrace new opportunities, find joy, and remain engaged in fulfilling work. Now in my 79th year, I focus on five key 'good F words' that continue to energize and inspire my ReFirement: Family, Fulfillment, Fitness, Friends, and Fun. These priorities guide me, providing balance and joy as I move through this stage of life. ReFirement has transformed my mindset from simply retiring from work to actively reFiring into a new life of authenticity. From Personal ReFirement To Client Conversations Just as I navigated my own ReFirement journey, financial advisors can guide clients through this exciting, yet sometimes challenging, transition. By embracing ReFirement, clients can redefine their retirement beyond the traditional financial model. As I reimagined my life after loss, financial advisors can help their clients view retirement as a time for continued personal growth, new ventures, and purpose-driven living. Encouraging clients to explore encore careers, volunteer opportunities, creative outlets, or other long-held passions supports not only their financial security but also their evolving sense of identity. Advocating ReFirement isn't about asking clients to leave work behind; it's about helping them step into a new phase where they can contribute, grow, and thrive. Advisors who help clients define and pursue these new paths often build deeper, more meaningful relationships and ensure their clients are ready for the next phase of their lives. Here’s a 2-minute video overview of my personal ReFirement journey: \u003cspan data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"\u003e\u0026#65279;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"\u003e\u0026#65279;\u003c/span\u003e How ReFirement Planning Differs From Traditional Retirement Planning Conventional retirement planning prioritizes building financial resources to support a comfortable lifestyle, emphasizing investments, cash flow, and income streams. ReFirement expands these objectives to include personal values and emotional satisfaction, aiming for Return on Happiness (ROH). Advisors assist clients in clarifying their evolving aspirations and integrating them into the financial strategy. The term \"ReFirement\" is gaining traction as a dynamic and positive alternative to traditional retirement concepts. Although not yet a widely established term, similar ideas are being considered by several thought leaders and organizations: Susan Williams, founder of Booming Encore, questions whether it's time to 'retire' the word \"retirement\" altogether. She suggests that the traditional concept no longer fits the diverse ways people live after leaving their primary careers. Ken Dychtwald, a psychologist and gerontologist, co-authored an article in the Harvard Business Review, proposing that the traditional retirement model is outdated. He advocates for a more flexible approach that allows individuals to contribute meaningfully beyond the conventional retirement age. Morningstar recently featured a MarketWatch article by Jessica Hall, provocatively declaring that \"retirement is nonsense\" and arguing that the concept itself may need a complete rebranding. It highlights how many retirees are seeking identity, purpose, and engagement well into later life – reinforcing the very foundation of the ReFirement movement. These perspectives align with the ReFirement concept, which emphasizes reinvention, continued engagement, and enriching later-life experiences. In many cases, retirees may continue working part-time or start new ventures – not out of financial need, but because they find joy in remaining productive. Flexible plans can accommodate alternative work schedules, volunteer roles, entrepreneurship, or creative endeavors without compromising core financial security. Helen Huntley is a great example of this. Retiring as personal finance editor after 37 years for the Tampa Bay Times (formerly the St. Petersburg Times), she pivoted to become an independent fee-only CFP practitioner. When she eventually entered her ReFirement, eight years later, she didn't stop growing. She trained as a docent for three local museums: the James Museum of Western \u0026 Wildlife Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, St. Petersburg, and the Museum of American Arts \u0026 Crafts Movement. The photo below shows Helen leading a monthly book discussion group, typically attended by dozens of participants… including me! Helen's story shows how ReFirement doesn't signify the end of direction. Rather, it's a way to create a new personal narrative based on interests, experience, and wisdom. Another powerful example of ReFirement is offered through Alan's story. Alan was a former lead pastor of a large congregation. After leaving his full-time ministry work, he earned certified coaching credentials and launched a part-time consulting practice. Alan now mentors new clergy members – especially those facing challenging ministry situations – and spends the rest of his time on rewarding personal pursuits, including writing a book. Alan's story illustrates how ReFirement can blend prior expertise with new callings, allowing individuals to remain rooted in their values while enjoying a more flexible and satisfying lifestyle. Advisors also play a key role in helping clients navigate these transitions – not just financially, but emotionally and psychologically. ReFirement often comes with a shift in identity, and this holistic process might include wellness planning, legacy discussions, emotional intelligence coaching, and creative exploration. Addressing The Emotional And Psychological Challenges Of ReFirement While ReFirement offers exciting opportunities for growth, contentment, and reinvention, it can also bring significant challenges, especially for those who've spent decades in a well-defined career. One of the biggest hurdles clients may face is losing their sense of self or meaning. After devoting much of their lives to a professional role, the transition to ReFirement can evoke feelings of uncertainty, loneliness, or even a sense of worthlessness. These emotions are natural and part of the adjustment process, but they can be difficult to navigate without support. Advisors play a crucial role in helping clients through this emotional terrain. By fostering open conversations about these feelings, advisors can help clients reframe the transition as an opportunity to discover new roles and passions. Tools like mindfulness practices, journaling, or personal legacy planning can offer clarity and emotional grounding. Advisors can also encourage clients to lean into a growth mindset, reminding them how their life's work has prepared them for a rewarding and impactful next chapter. Offering supportive resources – such as life coaches, support groups, or books like \"The Third Act: Reinventing Your Next Chapter\" by Josh Sapan – can further empower clients to embrace this phase with confidence and optimism. ReFirement challenges may include loss of identity, anxiety about the future, or grief. Setting The Stage For Insightful ReFirement Conversations Helping clients reimagine retirement often begins not with planning tools, but with the right conversations. Advisors can create a supportive environment by acknowledging the uncertainty clients may feel and gently introducing reflective prompts that invite exploration. By framing early dialogue with empathy and curiosity, advisors lay the groundwork for a more holistic planning process, where financial goals are thoughtfully aligned with the client's evolving sense of self and personal priorities. Navigating Fear And Uncertainty In Early ReFirement Discussions While the idea of ReFirement can be inspiring, clients may approach this stage with hesitation, worry, or a sense of loss even if they may be financially prepared to leave or switch careers. It's not uncommon for individuals to ask, \"Who am I now?\", \"What will give my life meaning?\", or \"What if I don't have a clear direction?\" as they adjust to a new identity beyond work. Advisors can play a crucial role during the early stages of ReFirement by acknowledging their clients' feelings with empathy and reassurance. Rather than rushing into plans or goals, it can be helpful to begin with a gentle, supportive approach: Many people feel a mix of excitement and uncertainty at this stage – that's completely normal. Let's explore what matters most to you, and we'll take it one step at a time. Once clients feel emotionally supported, they may be more open to thinking beyond uncertainty. This is a good time to shift the discussion to what might lie ahead – exploring aspirations, passions, and possibilities through open-ended dialogue. Continue With Purposeful Conversations After creating space for emotional reflection, advisors can build on that foundation by encouraging clients to think beyond the numbers. These discussions help uncover passions, legacy objectives, and personal values that may not have surfaced in more traditional retirement planning. Some possible questions to consider: \"What passions have you always wanted to explore?\" \"How do you envision your legacy?\" These prompts often lead to surprisingly rich perspectives, helping clients express goals they may not have shared otherwise. Here's an example of how a ReFirement-oriented dialogue might unfold in practice: Advisor: Now that we've established your financial comfort, let's shift to something equally important – your life beyond retirement. Have you thought about how you want to spend your time or what new passions you'd like to pursue? Client: Honestly, I haven't given it much thought beyond taking a break initially. Advisor: That's completely understandable. Think about your past experiences – are there activities you've enjoyed but haven't had time for? Perhaps community involvement, creative interests, or even mentoring younger professionals? Client: Well, I've always enjoyed mentoring colleagues, and I do love photography, though I've never really pursued it seriously. Advisor: That's wonderful! Imagine combining these interests, perhaps mentoring through a community program or experimenting with photography projects. How do you envision leaving a meaningful legacy you'd be proud of? Client: I'd love to inspire younger generations. Maybe mentoring through photography workshops or contributing my skills to local nonprofits could be fulfilling. Advisor: Fantastic ideas! Let's consider how we can align your financial plan to support and make these aspirations a practical reality. These types of conversations expand the planning process beyond the numbers and into the realm of identity, personal contribution, and creativity. They also strengthen the advisor-client relationship by demonstrating that the advisor sees the whole person – not just their balance sheet. By creating space for expression and curiosity, these discussions help clients reconnect with what matters most, often in unexpected ways. This deeper understanding becomes the foundation for a more personal and satisfying ReFirement plan. Transitioning into ReFirement involves more than just financial planning – it requires a shift in mindset. Advisors can play a significant role in helping clients move from the 'work phase' of life into a more open-ended chapter full of new possibilities. After meaningful conversations begin to surface what clients truly care about, advisors can introduce practical tools to deepen the process. Whether through visual exercises, structured prompts, or introspective activities, these resources help clients organize their thoughts, articulate their goals, and move forward with confidence. The tools that follow are designed to help clients clarify their priorities, expand their vision of what's possible, and stay grounded in a mindset of personal growth. Some can be used directly in client meetings, while others can be offered as between-meeting exercises that support deeper insight. Together, they reinforce a more holistic approach to ReFirement planning – one that goes beyond the numbers to engage values, drive, and vision. Growth Mindset Prompts One simple but powerful way to begin the ReFirement planning process is to help clients adopt a growth mindset. These prompts can serve as both conversation starters and independent reflection tools, helping clients reframe their next chapter as an opportunity for personal development rather than a retreat from productivity. Advisors might ask: \"What's something new you've always wanted to try but didn't have the time for?\" \"How can you view this next chapter as a time to grow and expand your horizons?\" Clients can also be encouraged to view their experiences, skills, and wisdom as assets – ones they can now apply in new ways, whether through mentorship, teaching, or creative endeavors. They can consider affirming phrases like: \"I am not retiring from something. I am stepping into something new and meaningful.\" \"This phase of my life is an opportunity for creativity, learning, and giving back.\" Tip: Advisors who may feel less conversationally inclined can still have powerful discussions by simply asking follow-up questions like \"Why?\" or \"What would that look like?\" These small nudges can keep the conversation flowing without requiring a long list of prepared prompts. For additional ideas on follow-up questions for effective client meetings, see Meghaan Lurtz's guidance in her article, The Power Of Follow-Up Questions: How Advisors Can Build Rapport With Prospects And Clients. How It Worked for Me. Adopting a growth mindset was critical for me in navigating my own ReFirement journey. When I began to embrace the idea that my transition wasn't a 'retirement' but a \"ReFiring\" into new roles, I opened myself to new opportunities I might not have considered otherwise. Whether taking on new nonprofit projects, teaching, or volunteering, these activities became more fulfilling when I approached them with a mindset of growth and intention. Why It Works For Clients. Advisors can support clients in adopting this same mindset shift. ReFirement isn't about stepping away from work, it's about finding new ways to contribute, learn, and grow. To help clients explore what the next chapter might look like, advisors can use discovery prompts, like the ones below, that invite them to reconnect with past passions and future possibilities. Reflective Questions To Deepen Discovery These deeper prompts can be used during client meetings or shared as journaling exercises to help clients uncover forgotten passions, consider their values and aspirations, and reveal a meaningful post-career identity. When used with intention, these questions can provide structure and inspiration for what might otherwise feel like a nebulous or overwhelming transition. What Would Your Younger Self Tell You About Your Best Future Self? Reflect on the dreams and interests you held during your youth. How might these inform your future endeavors and guide you toward activities that resonate with your authentic self? For example, if your younger self imagined being an artist, adventurer, or teacher, how might those passions manifest now in creative projects, travel, or mentoring others? What Did You Love Long Ago That You Can Love Again? Revisit past hobbies or interests that brought you joy but were set aside due to career or family responsibilities. Re-engaging with these passions can provide a renewed sense of focus and satisfaction. Perhaps you once loved playing piano, painting, or gardening – activities you can now return to with fresh perspective and joy in this new chapter of life. What's on Your Bucket List? What experiences or achievements do you still want to pursue? This exercise can reveal exciting new opportunities and adventures for the ReFirement years. For example, you might want to hike the Appalachian Trail, take a cooking class in Italy, or write a memoir. What Will You Do in the Next 12 Months? To initiate your transition into ReFirement, set specific, actionable goals for the year ahead. Establishing a clear plan can maintain momentum and direction. For example, you could commit to attending a local volunteer orientation, joining a creative writing group, or scheduling regular time for a new hobby like photography or genealogy. Incorporating these questions into client meetings or planning exercises adds clarity and direction, empowering individuals to craft an authentic and purpose-driven next chapter. Open-ended questions like \"What would you do if your work wasn't your primary focus?\" or \"What kind of legacy do you want to leave?\" prompt clients to dig deeper into their personal aspirations. These questions create space for self-reflection, helping clients connect their values to actionable goals and often opening the door to new and unexpected pursuits. For many clients – and for me personally – questions like these can be the turning point that reshapes their vision of what's possible. The values-ranking tool is one example of how clients can begin organizing their priorities in this new phase of life. How It Worked for Me. These introspective questions were essential when I reevaluated my own direction. I asked myself, \"What brings me the most fulfillment now?\" and \"How can I give back with my skills?\" These reflections led me to mentoring widows, volunteering, and teaching at The American College of Financial Services. They helped me discover and move into my next act in life with clarity and confidence. An activity like the \"Rating Your Life Values\" worksheet shown above can be a powerful tool for determining what matters most. Why It Works for Clients. I used this early in ReFirement conversations to help clients identify what truly matters to them. By narrowing down and ranking their top values, clients often gain insight into how they want to spend their time, energy, and money in this next phase of life. This exercise is adapted, with permission, from Ken Rouse's book \"Putting Money In Its Place\". Advisors can guide clients through a similar process of discovery by asking questions that prompt a deeper understanding of their values and desires. Many people don't initially realize that life after work can be a time to discover more than just hobbies – it's a chance to give back, rediscover old passions, or start something entirely new. By asking these questions, advisors empower clients to define a ReFirement that aligns with their core values, creating a life that feels both emotionally and personally satisfying. Visioning Exercises Visioning exercises – such as creating a vision board or journaling about post-career goals – can be particularly effective tools for helping clients articulate their passions and dreams in visual or written format. These activities encourage clients to look beyond financial concerns and engage with the emotional side of their future, allowing them to explore what truly excites and motivates them. One creative example is the Touchstone Poster project, which invites clients to visually organize their goals, values, and intentions for ReFirement. Using materials like poster board, sticky notes, photos, and markers, clients can create a personalized collage that serves as a visual compass for what they want this next chapter to include – from daily lifestyle preferences to bigger-picture dreams. The process encourages introspection and self-discovery around what matters most. As a flexible and hands-on tool, the Touchstone Poster can be a grounding reference point clients return to throughout their ReFirement journey. For clients who feel stuck or uncertain, journaling can serve as a gentle and personal way to begin uncovering what matters most. Here are a few prompts advisors can offer to spark reflection and awareness: \"What does a meaningful day look like for me in this next chapter?\" \"What does your ideal week in ReFirement look like?\" Ask your client to complete a worksheet that helps them think about what their ideal week looks like. They can fill out a page like the one below independently, and then come back to discuss it with you. Very interesting results may happen with a client couple, each doing their exercise separately and then coming together to discuss the ramifications. They may be surprised that each spouse has different ideas! \"What activities or experiences have brought me the most joy—and how can I bring more of that into my life now?\" \"If I could share one piece of wisdom or legacy with the next generation, what would it be?\" \"What do I want to be remembered for, and what small steps can I take toward that today?\" These prompts help clients move from ambiguity to inspiration, opening the door to visioning exercises that feel authentic and empowering. In addition to journaling, visualization and affirmations can be powerful tools to help clients see themselves thriving in their next chapter. Visualization encourages clients to mentally picture an enriching future – whether that's mentoring others, traveling, or enjoying unstructured time – creating a sense of excitement and possibility. One of my clients, for example, envisioned launching a part-time consulting business after retiring from a long corporate career. He wanted to continue making a difference, generate some income, and still have the freedom to travel with his spouse in their new RV for a couple of months each summer. Through visualization and affirmations like \"I can design a flexible life that blends purpose, income, and adventure,\" he began to see this next phase not as a trade-off, but as a deeply fulfilling integration of his values and goals. These practices help clients shift from uncertainty to empowerment, supporting both emotional readiness and practical planning. How It Worked For Me. In my own ReFirement journey, the Touchstone Poster exercise helped me narrow my focus and discover new directions for my life. My poster reflected several intentions that soon became reality: spending more time with the special man in my life, Charlie (who is now my husband); selling my home and relocating to St. Petersburg, Florida; letting my hair go gray and cutting it short – just like the image of the confident woman I included, Dame Judi Dench. It also included traveling frequently to Chicago to be with my grandson and his family; joining a local choir; and, after establishing my charitable fund at the Community Foundation of Tampa Bay, helping that organization promote philanthropy. At the bottom of the poster, I listed personal strengths I could rely on to bring these goals to life. Reviewing my poster gave me insights into how to realign my time and energy, ultimately leading to meaningful opportunities and fulfillment. Looking back, this visual map not only clarified what I wanted—it helped me believe I could make it happen. Why It Works for Clients. When advisors guide clients through similar visioning exercises, they help bring their aspirations to life. Whether it's volunteering, starting a new business, or dedicating time to a personal passion, visioning helps clients reframe retirement as a beginning, not an end. This shift in mindset can be transformative, empowering clients to view ReFirement as a time to thrive, not withdraw. Legacy Planning Tools Legacy planning templates and storytelling prompts can help clients think about what they want to leave behind – whether that's a financial legacy, a family tradition, or contributions to a cause they care about. These tools prompt clients to reflect on their long-term impact, helping them shape a legacy that goes beyond material wealth. I developed a legacy letter tool that to help clients with this process. It's free to  download here, and consists of checklists that help clients consider how they might address the following areas in a letter to their families: Balance In Life Education, Knowledge, and Learning Family and Friends Being Honest, Truthful, and Sincere The Importance of Humor Giving Doing Good Learning From Your Mistakes Religion/Spirituality Lessons I've Learned Reflections Hopes for the Future Love Forgiveness Other Requests In addition to reflecting on legacy values, advisors can also help with charitable giving strategies that support those values. This might include setting up donor-advised funds, charitable gift annuities, or using Legacy IRAs to support meaningful causes in a tax-efficient way. Advisors can also use sample legacy-focused prompts to guide these discussions to build financial plans around values. How It Worked For Me. Legacy planning became central to my own ReFirement journey. As I shifted from my original career to my encore role, I considered how to use my expertise to empower others, especially widows. I launched a giving fund at the Community Foundation of Tampa Bay, supporting my mission even after my passing. This legacy planning helped me clarify the impact I wanted to make in the world and gave me a sense of purpose, not just in the moment, but for years to come. Why It Works for Clients. Many clients approaching ReFirement are thinking about the future of their family and community. Legacy planning tools can help clients articulate the long-term impact they want to make, whether through charitable giving, creating a family legacy, or supporting causes they care about. These tools can be transformative, offering clients a sense of direction and meaning during significant life change, enabling them to leave a lasting imprint on the world around them. Resource Networks (Support Systems) Building a supportive network of professionals and tools can help clients navigate the emotional and psychological aspects of transitioning into ReFirement. While financial planning is essential, many clients also benefit from resources that support personal growth and well-being in this new life phase. Advisors don't need to be experts in every area, but they can serve as connectors. The following organizations and tools can support both clients and advisors. Advisor Education And Frameworks These organizations and models offer advisor training and structured approaches to bring life planning into the financial planning process. The Financial Transitionist Institute (FTI) offers tools that emphasize the human side of transitions, including communication frameworks, visual aids, and exercises that help clients clarify what is changing in their lives. Prompts and activities help advisors uncover what clients want from retirement beyond finances. Money Quotient provides values-based tools that help advisors and clients integrate life meaning with financial decision-making. I found their early materials especially helpful when I began incorporating more holistic approaches into my planning conversations. George Kinder's EVOKE® process is a foundational life planning framework that helps clients identify their deepest life goals and align their financial plans accordingly. His structured discovery approach is particularly effective for clients exploring identity and meaning post-career. The Financial Therapy Association (FTA) brings together psychology and financial planning, offering research-informed tools and resources that advisors can use with clients experiencing anxiety, grief, or emotional conflict around money. The Alliance of Comprehensive Planners (ACP) – formerly the Alliance of Cambridge Advisors – emphasizes a holistic, fee-only planning model. Years ago, I contributed materials to help ACP advisors examine client values, transitions, and life goals as part of the financial planning process – resources that still resonate today. Client-Facing Tools And Resources These books, exercises, and organizations offer clients tools to reflect on personal values, aspirations, and lifestyle design during ReFinement. Books like Designing Your Life by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans provide interactive exercises using design thinking principles to help individuals create fulfilling lives. AARP's Life Reimagined program offers a transformative approach to retirement and beyond, providing tools and resources to help individuals explore new possibilities, pursue personal passions, and create a rich and meaningful chapter beyond traditional retirement. Therapists, life coaches, or peer groups can also be important resources, especially for clients navigating emotional complexity during major life changes. These RIAs and large firms have incorporated more holistic or ReFirement-inspired thinking into their public-facing client education and planning processes. Intelligent Investing Advisors (an RIA based in South Carolina) brands its retirement planning process around the ReFirement concept. As the firm puts it, their mission is to help clients \"not just retire but reFire their lives\" for a fulfilling future. Their recent client education initiative featured me as a noted author and thought leader on purposeful aging and reFirement. Brokerage firms like Merrill Lynch, Edward Jones, and Raymond James have provided educational materials that encourage clients to consider life goals beyond finances. While they offer information for self-guided introspection, it's not known whether these firms actively engage clients with collaborative tools and activities specifically designed for use with an advisor during planning sessions. Thought Leadership And Research This resource offers insights into cultural trends, aging, research, and broader lifestyle planning that can inform both advisors and clients. AgeWave, led by Ken Dychtwald, specializes in aging population research and collaborates with financial institutions to shape retirement planning. They provide perspectives on evolving client needs and holistic approaches that integrate health, family dynamics, and personal satisfaction into retirement strategies. AgeWave's contributions influence how firms approach ReFirement, integrating research-based insights into client engagement and educational efforts. How It Worked for Me. Throughout my own ReFirement, I used several of these tools and frameworks. Early on, I drew insight from Money Quotient and George Kinder's life planning models. Working with Nancy Nelson, CFP® helped me clarify my next steps, and training as an End-of-Life Doula opened up a whole new realm of purpose and service. Why It Works for Clients. Clients often don't know where to begin when reimagining life beyond work. These tools and networks offer clear starting points—whether through guided reflection, structured exercises, or meaningful connections. When advisors connect clients with the right resources, they enhance both emotional support and the planning experience, creating a richer, more rewarding ReFirement experience. These resources provide emotional, social, and professional guidance, ensuring clients feel supported as they reimagine their post-career lives. Measuring Success In ReFirement: Beyond Financial Metrics While financial stability is a crucial aspect of ReFirement, true success in this life stage often extends well beyond money. Advisors can help clients measure success through non-financial metrics such as well-being, life satisfaction, and engagement with new activities. For example, some clients may define success in ReFirement as feeling enriched through volunteer work, nurturing family relationships, or pursuing a lifelong passion they never had time for. Happiness metrics – such as how often clients feel energized, purposeful, or connected to their communities – are key indicators of whether they thrive in this new phase. In addition to holding regular check-in sessions, advisors can also introduce tools like satisfaction surveys or wellness assessments to track clients' transitions. These can help clients evaluate how their emotional, social, and personal growth aligns with their financial goals, ensuring a holistic view of success. By incorporating these measures into ongoing planning meetings, advisors can offer a more complete, enriching ReFirement experience beyond financial security. To help advisors put this mindset into action and empower clients to embrace this exciting phase with confidence and awareness, the following checklist outlines key areas to explore with clients who are preparing for ReFirement. ReFirement Planning Checklist For Financial Advisors Use this checklist to guide ReFirement-inclined clients through a transition that's not only financially secure but also emotionally and personally rewarding. ReFirement is about helping clients redefine their next chapter – not just in terms of finances but also in terms of personal growth, legacy, and happiness. Initiate Purpose-Driven Conversations Ask open-ended questions to help clients think about what their post-career life might look like (e.g., \"What would you do if your work wasn't your primary focus?\"). Also ask good follow-up questions. Discuss what fulfillment looks like to them in this new phase of life. Explore passions and interests that clients may want to pursue after leaving their career. Assess clients' financial readiness for ReFirement, including cash flow, investment strategy, and insurance coverage. Ensure that their financial foundation supports their new purpose-driven goals (e.g., budgeting for new passions, part-time work, or philanthropic contributions). Discuss financial flexibility in their plan, allowing for sabbaticals, part-time work, or new ventures without compromising their financial security. Support A Growth Mindset Introduce the concept of a \"growth mindset\" and encourage clients to see ReFirement as an opportunity for personal growth. Ask clients: \"What's something new you've always wanted to try but didn't have time for?\" Encourage clients to consider new roles that tap into their experience and wisdom – whether it's mentoring, teaching, or pursuing a passion project. Guide Visioning and Future Planning Introduce exercises like the vision board, touchstone poster, or journaling about their ideal future. Help clients visualize the lifestyle they want to create – whether focused on hobbies, travel, volunteer work, relationships, or creative endeavors. Encourage clients to clarify how they wish to spend their time after their careers and what they want to prioritize (e.g., health, family, community). Work with clients to create positive affirmations about their ReFirement. Example: \"This phase of my life is an opportunity for creativity, learning, and giving back.\" Encourage clients to visualize their ideal life in ReFirement and how they will achieve it. Incorporate these affirmations into regular client meetings to keep their mindset positive and centered on growth. Explore Legacy and Impact Planning Start discussions about the client's legacy – financial and otherwise. Use legacy planning tools, such as templates or storytelling prompts, to help clients articulate the long-term impact they want to leave (e.g., charitable giving, creating family traditions). Guide clients in setting up funds or charitable initiatives that align with their values and legacy goals. Connect Clients To Emotional Support and Resource Networks Identify professionals (life coaches, wellness experts, etc.) to assist clients during their transition to ReFirement. Connect clients with local volunteer organizations or nonprofit groups to begin exploring ways to give back. Suggest mindfulness practices (e.g., meditation, journaling) to help clients stay grounded and manage transition anxiety. Recommend books or articles on the psychology of ReFirement and personal growth in retirement. Offer access to workshops or seminars on topics like volunteerism, encore careers, and wellness during ReFirement. Check-In and Reassessment Schedule follow-up meetings to revisit clients' evolving goals and aspirations. Revisit the visioning exercises and legacy discussions to see if any shifts or new aspirations have emerged. Adapt financial strategies to support new goals or lifestyle changes clients discover through these exercises. With this checklist in hand, advisors can position themselves to help clients turn possibility into a ReFirement with purpose! Lighting The Spark: Advisors' Holistic Role In ReFirement Financial advisors can enhance their toolkit by incorporating visioning exercises, introspective questions, legacy planning tools, and resource networks into client meetings. These tools help clients plan financially while also shaping a ReFirement that represents their values, goals, and identity. As ReFirement gains traction, a more holistic approach to planning can guide clients toward a future that feels intentional and well-supported. These conversations deepen the advisor-client relationship and create space for clients to imagine what's possible – both financially and personally. ReFirement is not just about stepping away from work; it's about stepping into a new phase of life with clarity, confidence, and connection. By guiding clients through this transition, advisors ensure they're financially prepared and emotionally and personally enriched as they step into their next chapter. Quality? Nerdy? Relevant?

But as more individuals confront the emotional realities of this life transition, many find that the absence of structure, socialization, and identity once provided by work can create a gap that traditional retirement planning doesn\u0026#39;t fully address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this guest post, Kathleen Rehl, a \u0026#34;ReFired\u0026#34; financial advisor and educator in legacy planning, shares a framework to help advisors guide clients through this transition using a more expansive \u0026#34;ReFirement\u0026#34; lens. Drawing from her own encore career and decades of client experience, Kathleen illustrates how retirement can be reframed not as an end, but as a beginning – one centered on fulfillment, self-exploration, and purpose. While the core elements of traditional retirement planning remain (e.g., income streams, cash flow, and lifestyle support), ReFirement builds on this foundation to explore evolving values and aspirations, with the goal of living more intentionally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet even clients who are financially prepared may feel anxious or uncertain about what comes next. ReFirement addresses these concerns by blending financial planning with conversations that create space for safe, reflective exploration. Instead of viewing retirement as a retreat from productivity, clients are invited to see it as a launchpad for creativity, contribution, and personal growth. For many, this phase brings a complex emotional landscape – including grief, identity shifts, or even a lingering sense of disconnection – which can be difficult to process without thoughtful support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo help clients move forward, advisors can introduce practical tools that invite personal reflection and visualization. These include growth mindset prompts, values exercises, and legacy planning templates designed to help clients clarify what matters most. For example, visual activities like the \u0026#34;Touchstone Poster\u0026#34; or a guided values-ranking worksheet can help clients reconnect with forgotten passions or explore new aspirations. Whether they\u0026#39;re exploring mentorship opportunities, creative outlets, or philanthropic goals, many clients find surprising clarity simply by having the space to reflect. Importantly, advisors don\u0026#39;t have to guide this process alone – resources from organizations such as the Financial Transitionist Institute (FTI), Money Quotient, and George Kinder\u0026#39;s EVOKE Process offer structure to support more meaningful planning conversations. Kathleen also shares a checklist of open-ended prompts that can serve as a roadmmap to help clients envision what a \u0026#34;ReFired\u0026#34; retirement might look like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, the key point is that ReFirement offers a richer, more expansive vision for what retirement can be – not just a phase of rest, but a new opportunity for growth, contribution, and renewal. By helping clients align their financial strategies with their evolving values and aspirations, advisors can create space for deeper conversations and more rewarding outcomes. And in doing so, they don\u0026#39;t just prepare clients for what\u0026#39;s next; they empower them to step into it with clarity and confidence, and a renewed sense of purpose and joy!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg width=\"200\" height=\"200\" data-src=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kathleen-Rehl-Author-Photo-New-200x200.jpg\" alt=\"Kathleen Rehl Author Photo (New)\" decoding=\"async\" data-srcset=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kathleen-Rehl-Author-Photo-New-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kathleen-Rehl-Author-Photo-New-150x150.jpg 150w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" src=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kathleen-Rehl-Author-Photo-New-200x200.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kathleen-Rehl-Author-Photo-New-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kathleen-Rehl-Author-Photo-New-150x150.jpg 150w\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKathleen Rehl owned Rehl Financial Advisors for 18 years before retiring to an active 6-year encore career empowering widows with her speaking, writing, and research.

As a result, the traditional model of retirement planning is becoming increasingly inadequate, especially when it fails to account for the emotional weight of transitions that shake a person\u0026#39;s sense of self.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsider the case of a prominent 69-year-old medical director whose career pinnacle abruptly dissolved, leaving him adrift in a sea of bitterness and uncertainty. A concerned friend shared his story, revealing a stark reality: Retirement is about far more than finances and leisure. It also encompasses individuality, purpose, connection, and fulfillment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis paradigm shift calls upon financial advisors to reimagine their approach to retirement planning, integrating a deeper understanding of clients\u0026#39; holistic needs beyond financial security alone.

ReFirement emphasizes the importance of maintaining a sense of meaning, identity, and connection in later years, often involving continued learning, community involvement, and pursuing passions that may have been set aside during one\u0026#39;s career-focused years. It\u0026#39;s about redefining retirement as a time of vibrant engagement and personal enrichment rather than simply a period of leisure and relaxation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"my-refirement-journey\"\u003eMy ReFirement Journey\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter varied careers – including roles as a public-school teacher, university professor, nonprofit development officer, and CFP professional – I faced a profound loss with the death of my husband. Rather than retreating into traditional retirement at 67, I embraced the concept of ReFirement. This meant pivoting to a rewarding encore career focused on empowering widows financially through writing, speaking, research, and mentoring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the next six years, I wrote or was quoted in more than 150 published articles and gave nearly 300 presentations, mainly dedicated to helping widows and the advisors who served them.

I took a short sabbatical to broaden my focus and found renewed direction in assisting nonprofits to build endowments, which I now do regularly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReFirement also opened the door to new passions. I joined a local choir, enrolled in memoir and poetry writing classes, and was invited to join the adjunct faculty at The American College of Financial Services, where I still teach.

Many people don\u0026#39;t initially realize that life after work can be a time to discover more than just hobbies – it\u0026#39;s a chance to give back, rediscover old passions, or start something entirely new. By asking these questions, advisors empower clients to define a ReFirement that aligns with their core values, creating a life that feels both emotionally and personally satisfying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"visioning-exercises\"\u003eVisioning Exercises\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisioning exercises – such as creating a vision board or journaling about post-career goals – can be particularly effective tools for helping clients articulate their passions and dreams in visual or written format.
