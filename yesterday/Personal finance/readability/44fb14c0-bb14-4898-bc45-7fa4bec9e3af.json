  "text": "Metal roofs come with a larger price tag than traditional asphalt shingle roofs, which means you'll want to be sure a metal roof is a fit for you before making the financial commitment. There are many benefits to metal roofs and handful of drawbacks. Pros of metal roofsMetal roofs bring a number of advantages including:Longevity. The metal roof you install may be the last roof installation of your lifetime. This is because metal roofs can easily last as long as 50 years or more — in some cases over 100 years, which is much longer than the life of an asphalt shingle roof, which lasts 15-25 years.Durability. Metal roofs are more resistant to fire, insects and mildew than shingle roofs. Additionally, metal roofs can withstand many severe weather conditions, such as snow, high winds and hail.Eco-friendly. Metal roofs are recyclable and long-lasting, reducing waste. These roofing materials are also reflective, which helps save energy by keeping homes cool in the warmer months.Low maintenance. Once you install a metal roof, there’s relatively very little maintenance required for the duration of its very long lifespan. All you really need to do is keep the roof free of debris and clean the gutters.Aesthetic appeal. Metal roofs are available in a variety of colors and designs to suit almost any home style.Cons of metal roofsBefore opting for a metal roof, however, consider these potential drawbacks:Expense. Metal roofs are generally significantly more expensive than shingle roofs, particularly if you choose one of the more costly materials such as zinc or copper.Vulnerable to certain storm damage. Although metal roofs are highly durable and stand up well to weather in general, if they do get damaged during storms, this damage can be extensiveU.S. Department of Energy. Metal Roofs. Accessed Dec 9, 2024.. Certain metals are prone to denting if hit with heavy debris, as well as peeling paint. And if a metal sheet gets detached during a storm, it can become a deadly projectile. Additionally the natural expansion and contraction of metal during temperature changes can loosen fasteners, causing leaks.Noise. Although some may enjoy the sound of rain or hail on a metal roof, this can get very noisy, which some consider a real drawback. There are ways to soften the noise, so if you’re bothered by a noisy roof, you may want to discuss this with your roofer.HOA requirements. Some homeowners associations may not allow metal roofing.Metal roof installationAlthough each roofing situation is unique, and the order of tasks may vary, installing a metal roof typically involves these basic steps:Initial evaluation. Measurement and inspection of your existing roof to assess necessary materials/supplies and what work needs to be done. During this stage, your contractor will look at your roof’s condition, size and pitch.Removal of old shingles. Existing roof materials are torn off to reveal the deck, so that the deck can be inspected and repaired as needed. Any damaged or rotted deck boards are removed and replaced. Although it’s possible to install a metal roof over your existing roof shingles, some experts believe that removing existing roofing materials is very important. That’s because removing your old roof completely brings the roof decking into clear view and provides the opportunity to identify and replace any damaged or rotted boards. If you skip this step, you may be laying your new roof over a compromised foundation. Additionally, not removing old shingles adds the risk of code violations, warranty issues, issues with insulation, longevity and ventilation, too much total weight over the house and possible leaks that are difficult to trace.Installation of flashing and underlayment. Metal flashing helps keep water from getting under the roof, and the underlayment is a roof-wide barrier between the metal roof and your home.Mounting of panels. Metal panels are measured, cut, positioned, screwed in and trimmed.Placement of ridge cap. A ridge cap on the top edges of the roof helps protect against harsh weather to maintain roof longevity.Final inspection/cleanup. Roof is checked for gaps, misaligned panels and loose screws to make sure everything is watertight and secure. All old debris, tools and roofing materials are removed from the property.Metal roofing can be done DIY, but be aware that this can be a more hazardous job than many other home projects. Anyone wanting to take this on should already be familiar and comfortable with roofing safety protocols and sheet metal work. If you lack this basic knowledge, it would make more sense to hire an experienced contractor.Deciding between metal roofs vs. shinglesWhile both metal roofs and shingles provide excellent coverage and protection for your home, there are some important differences to consider. Here’s how they stack up in a number of key areas:Cost. Metal roofs are typically more expensive than shingle roofs.Style options. Both have lots of options to suit a wide variety of styles and tastes.Durability. Metal roofs don’t absorb water (like shingle roofs do) so they’re not vulnerable to cracking, lifting and mildew/algae growth. This makes metal roofs more durable than shingle roofs.Longevity. It’s possible for a metal roof to last 50-100 years or more. Asphalt shingle roofs last about 15 to 25 years, with shorter lifespans in colder climates.Energy and environment. Metal roofs are more environmentally friendly and can better help you save energy.Maintenance. Metal roofs require much less maintenance and repair than traditional shingle roofs.Can I get financing for a home repair or improvement?Your contractor may offer some financing options (either through a partner or a payment plan), but there are other — any maybe better — financing options available.Home equity loan or HELOCHome equity loans or home equity lines of credit (HELOC) may have lower interest rates than financing with an installer, as well as future opportunities for refinancing and possible tax benefits.With a home equity loan, you receive a lump-sum payment and then pay it back at a fixed interest rate over an agreed period of time, typically five to 30 years. HELOCs are more akin to a credit card, something you use as needed. You’ll usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit, during which time you only have to pay interest, and after that you pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time. And with each of these options, you're using your home as collateral.Many banks, credit unions and online lenders offer personal loans, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000 and with fixed annual percentage rates. You receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. Unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral. This means your home isn’t at risk if you miss payments, but you’ll still have to pay late fees and the late payments can negatively impact your credit.Credit cards are an option for lower cost repairs or renovations. That’s because credit cards typically charge higher interest rates than home equity loans, HELOCs and personal loans. When used responsibly, credit cards can come with great benefits, such as 0% introductory APR periods that allow you to avoid interest for a set number of months; rewards so you can earn cash back, travel or points; and sign-up bonuses that can give you some extra cash back or rewards for a larger purchase. If you go this route, you’ll want to make sure you pick one of the best credit cards for home improvements. Which financing option is best for me?The best financing option for you will depend on how much money you need, when you need the money, what project you’re doing and how long you need to pay the money back. If it’s something that’ll add value to your home, a HELOC or home equity loan may be your best option because the value of your house could increase by more than the amount of the loan.On the flip side, if it’s a less expensive repair, a credit card is probably your best option if you want to pay no interest or earn rewards. Personal loans can apply to both small and large repairs or renovations, and they may make sense if you don’t have much equity in your home.Some home improvement contractors offer their own financing options. Before taking this option, shop around and see how their offer compares with other loans.Regardless of what you choose, make sure you compare interest rates, terms and fees with any financing options you’re considering. This will ensure you get the best deal.",

HELOCs are more akin to a credit card, something you use as needed. You’ll usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit, during which time you only have to pay interest, and after that you pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time. And with each of these options, you\u0026#39;re using your home as collateral.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMany banks, credit unions and online lenders offer personal loans, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000 and with fixed annual percentage rates. You receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. Unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral. This means your home isn’t at risk if you miss payments, but you’ll still have to pay late fees and the late payments can negatively impact your credit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCredit cards are an option for lower cost repairs or renovations. That’s because credit cards typically charge higher interest rates than home equity loans, HELOCs and personal loans. When used responsibly, credit cards can come with great benefits, such as 0% introductory APR periods that allow you to avoid interest for a set number of months; rewards so you can earn cash back, travel or points; and sign-up bonuses that can give you some extra cash back or rewards for a larger purchase. If you go this route, you’ll want to make sure you pick one of the best credit cards for home improvements. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch3 data-currency=\"Text\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhich financing option is best for me?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe best financing option for you will depend on how much money you need, when you need the money, what project you’re doing and how long you need to pay the money back.
