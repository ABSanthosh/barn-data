You can buy stamps at… Looking to know where to buy stamps near you or online? Buying stamps is an important task for many people. You might need stamps to mail letters, pay bills, or send cards to friends and family. Knowing where to get stamps can save you time and make mailing things easier. You can buy stamps at many different places. The post office is a common spot, but it’s not the only option. Grocery stores, pharmacies, and online shops also sell stamps. This means you have lots of choices when you need to stock up on postage for your mail. So, if you want to try other places to find stamps so that you can save time (post office lines can be so long these days!) and make it more convenient for you, here are some of your options. 13 Places To Buy Stamps Near You and Online Below are the best places to buy stamps near you or online. 1. United States Post Office The post office is a great place to buy stamps. You can find one near you in most towns and cities. Post offices have lots of stamp options to choose from (such as the value and also the design!). When you go to the post office, you can talk to a clerk at the counter. They can help you pick out stamps and tell you about different choices. You can buy single stamps or books of stamps. Post offices usually have special stamp designs too. These might have pretty pictures or celebrate holidays. You can ask to see what fun stamps they have available. They even usually have ones specifically for weddings, if that’s what you’re looking for. Some post offices have self-service kiosks. These machines let you buy stamps without waiting in line, and you can use a credit card to pay at the kiosk. 2. USPS.com USPS.com is a great place to buy stamps without leaving your home. You can easily shop for stamps online and have them delivered to your mailbox. The website has a wide selection of stamps. In fact, when I just looked, there were 107 different stamp designs that I could choose from. You can find Forever Stamps, special designs, and collectible options too. They have many different themes, such as holidays, animals, nature, fruit, flowers, weddings, people, kids, sports, and more. So, shopping online on the USPS website is great if you want specialty stamps and want to take your time finding the best design. Ordering is simple. Just go to the USPS Postal Store on their website, browse through the available stamps, and pick the ones you like. You can pay with a credit card or PayPal. The stamps will be shipped to your address in a few days. The only downside with ordering stamps online is that you have to remember to plan ahead when ordering online. It takes a few days for your stamps to arrive in the mail. I usually like to order a roll of stamps so that I never run out. 3. Local UPS store Did you know you can buy stamps at your local UPS store? It’s true! UPS stores have a variety of postal services, including selling stamps. You can easily pick up stamps while running other errands, which makes this option nice. UPS stores usually have convenient locations and longer hours than post offices. I was recently at the UPS store for another reason (I had them print out some papers that I needed), and at the same time, I realized that I needed one stamp. Yes, I could have gone home to get it, but I just wanted to get the errand over with. They sold me one Forever Stamp and even took the mail for me to mail it off. It was very convenient! Many UPS stores sell different types of stamps. You can get regular Forever Stamps or specialty designs for special occasions. Next time you need stamps, check out your nearby UPS store. It could save you a trip to the post office and make mailing easier. 4. Grocery store Buying stamps at the grocery store is easy and quick. Many big chains like Safeway, Costco, and Whole Foods sell stamps. You don’t need to make a special trip to the post office, which can save a lot of time because you already buy groceries on a regular basis anyways. Just ask the cashier when you’re checking out. They might keep stamps right at the register. You can buy a book of stamps along with your groceries. Some stores have self-checkout machines that sell stamps too. Look for the option on the screen when you’re paying. Grocery stores usually sell stamps at the same price as the post office. It’s a handy way to get stamps while doing your regular shopping. 5. Amazon You can buy stamps on Amazon. It’s easy and convenient as many people already shop on Amazon for other things. You can find the USPS stamps section on Amazon by clicking here. Amazon sells different types of stamps. You can find Forever Stamps, which work for first-class mail. They also have stamps for special occasions. You can buy stamps in different amounts too. Some come in books of 20. Others are available in larger quantities, like rolls of 100. Amazon usually offers free shipping on stamp orders, so this can save you money. It’s also nice if you don’t want to go to the post office. When you buy stamps on Amazon, make sure to check the seller. It’s best to buy from the official USPS store or trusted sellers so that you know that you are getting real stamps. Buying stamps on Amazon can be a good choice if you’re already placing an order. You can add them to your cart along with other items you need. Remember to compare prices, though. Sometimes, stamps on Amazon might cost a bit more than at the post office. But the convenience might be worth it for you. 6. Walmart You can easily buy stamps at Walmart. This big store sells stamps along with many other items. Walmart offers different types of stamps. They have Forever Stamps, which are always good for mailing a letter. You can get these in books of 20. Some Walmart stores keep stamps at the customer service desk. Others have them at regular checkout counters. If you can’t find them, just ask a worker for help. Buying stamps at Walmart is handy. You can pick them up while doing your other shopping, and this saves you a trip to the post office. Walmart’s prices for stamps are the same as other places. They don’t charge extra. So you’re not spending more by getting them here. Remember, not all Walmart stores are the same. Some might have more stamp choices than others, but most will have at least the basic stamps you need. 7. eBay You can find stamps on eBay. It’s a big online marketplace where people buy and sell all kinds of things. Stamps are one of those things. EBay has lots of stamps for sale. You can find single stamps or big packs of them. Some are new and some are old (such as vintage stamps!). Many sellers have free shipping on stamps and this can save you money. You might even find stamps for less than what they cost at the post office. Be careful when buying stamps on eBay as you will want to make sure the seller is trustworthy. I recommend that you read their reviews from other buyers to stay safe and not get scammed with fake stamps. EBay is also great for stamp collectors. You can find rare and old stamps there. But if you just need stamps for mailing, look for new ones at good prices. 8. Staples Staples is a popular office supply store that used to sell stamps. But things have changed. They no longer offer this service in their physical stores. But don’t worry! Staples still has some options for you and they sell stamps online through their website. You can order them and have them delivered to your home or office. 9. Office Depot Office Depot is a great place to buy stamps. They sell different types of stamps in their stores and online. You can find Forever Stamps at Office Depot. You can buy stamps in the store or order them online. If you order online, you can pick them up at the store or have them sent to your home. 10. Costco You can buy stamps at Costco. They sell them in big packs of 100. This is great if you send a lot of mail or run a small business. Costco mainly sells Forever Stamps. These stamps work for first-class mail and never expire. You can use them even if stamp prices go up later. Remember, you need a Costco membership to shop there. But if you already have one, buying stamps at Costco can be convenient if you already do your other shopping there. 11. Target You might think Target sells stamps, but that’s not always true. Some Target stores sell stamps, while others don’t. It’s not a sure thing. If you need stamps, it’s best to call your local Target first. Ask if they have stamps before making a trip. This can save you time and frustration. 12. CVS CVS is an easy place to buy stamps. You can find them at most CVS stores across the country. They sell books of 20 stamps. The stamps are available at the checkout counter. Just ask the cashier for a book of stamps when you’re ready to pay. It’s that easy! 13. Walgreens You can usually buy stamps at Walgreens, just like with CVS. Walgreens mainly sells First Class Forever Stamps. You can find stamps at the checkout counter, behind the register. Frequently Asked Questions You have lots of options for buying stamps. Here are answers to common questions about where to get stamps and how much they cost.

You can get them at grocery stores, pharmacies, and office supply stores. Some banks may also have stamps available. Where is the easiest place to get stamps?

Online ordering from USPS.com is also very easy and convenient as you can browse through all of the different fun designs that they sell. Is the post office the cheapest place to buy stamps? The post office is the easiest and most reliable place to buy stamps since they sell them at face value, but it’s not always the cheapest. Some websites, like eBay, may sell discounted stamps, though you need to be cautious of counterfeits and stick to reputable sellers. Wholesale clubs like Costco or Sam’s Club sometimes sell stamps at a slight discount, making them a good option for savings. Grocery stores and retailers usually sell stamps at the same price as the post office. For most people, the post office is a convenient and safe choice, but wholesale clubs or online deals might help you save a little money if you’re careful. But overall, stamps are usually a very similar amount of money no matter where you buy them. Does Target sell stamps? Yes, some Target locations sell stamps. You may be able to buy them at the customer service desk in some Target stores. They usually have books of Forever Stamps available. Does Walgreens sell stamps in store? Yes, Walgreens sells stamps in their stores. You can ask for them at the checkout counter. They typically sell books of Forever Stamps (not single stamps). How much do stamps cost? A Forever Stamp costs $0.73 as of 2024. A book of 20 stamps is $14.60. Prices may change (they change the price of the Forever Stamp usually around once a year), so check with the post office for the most up-to-date rates. Can I buy a single stamp? Yes, you can buy single stamps at post offices. Some grocery stores and pharmacies may sell individual stamps too. But buying in bulk is usually cheaper. Where to buy stamps online?

For most people, the post office is a convenient and safe choice, but wholesale clubs or online deals might help you save a little money if you’re careful.
