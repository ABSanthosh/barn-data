When I started my business, I didn’t have a business plan, a pile of savings, or even much experience running a website (I had none). But I had a desire to create something of my own, and I was willing to learn as I went. That was enough to get the ball rolling. If you’re dreaming of starting a small business idea but feel like your bank account is holding you back, this post is for you. Today, I’m going to walk you through how to start a business with no money, real examples of businesses you can start for free, and tips to keep your costs low while you build something amazing. How To Start a Business With No Money Below is how you can start a business with no money. Recommended reading: I’ve Done Over 20 Side Hustles in My Life: Here’s What I Think of Each 1. Choose a business idea that requires little money If you want to start a business without money, the type of business you choose makes a big difference. Personally, I think that service-based businesses are a great place to start. This is because you usually don’t need inventory, a storefront, or expensive machines. Instead, you’re selling a skill or service you already have. These kinds of businesses can usually be run with just a phone or laptop, and they don’t require you to invest in products or materials upfront or have to find a supplier. This means you can earn money much sooner and even land your first customer the same week you launch. Here are some business ideas you can start today: Blogging (like I did) Printables and templates (or other digital products) Proofreading Bookkeeping Freelance writing Virtual assistant Social media manager Dog walking or pet sitting Cleaning service Print-on-Demand or other type of online store These businesses mostly require your time, not your money. You can start by selling services to people you know or promoting yourself online. And you don’t have to be an expert to start. If you’re good at something and willing to improve, that’s enough to get started. You can always improve what you’re selling as you gain more experience. If you’re not sure what kind of business to start, think about what people already come to you for. Do friends ask you for help with resumes? Are you the go-to person for fixing tech problems? Use that as your starting point. Sometimes the best ideas are right in front of you and you just have to brainstorm a little bit. I recommend reading How To Decide What Business To Start in 8 Easy Steps to learn more. 2. Start with what you already have One of the great things about starting a business today is that you probably already have the tools you need. A phone, laptop, internet connection, and your own skills can take you a long way. There are tons of free tools that can help you run a business, and many entrepreneurs, including myself, start with just the basics. Here are some of my favorite free or low-cost tools: Google Docs and Sheets for writing and spreadsheets Canva for creating graphics and designs Zoom or Google Meet for virtual meetings Gmail or another free email service for communication Community resources – local libraries usually have free Wi-Fi, meeting rooms, and access to business databases Even your phone camera can be used to take decent product or service photos if needed. If your dream business is more hands-on – like cleaning homes, pet care, or doing handyman work – you still probably already have what you need to begin. A broom, mop, vacuum, tools, or even a reliable car can go a long way when starting a service-based business in your local area. I still use many of the same free tools to this day. When I started my blog, I used what I had, and I slowly upgraded as my income grew. You don’t need to go into debt or spend a fortune on startup costs. You can start simple and build as you go. 3. Build your business online The internet has made it easier than ever to start a business from home. And in most cases, you can start building your presence online for free or for little money. You no longer need a storefront to have a real business. All you need is a way for people to find you, learn about your services or products, and contact you. And, there are several free ways to make this happen. Here’s what I recommend: Create a social media profile for your business. Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn, and other social media platforms are great places to start. Join local or niche Facebook groups and share your services (just be sure to follow group rules). Use an easy website builder like WordPress to create a homepage. You can find my tutorial here and start a website for less than $50. Give a discount to your first few customers in exchange for testimonials or referrals. Share helpful content related to your services to build trust and authority. You don’t need a perfect brand or logo to get started and for potential customers to find you. The most important part is telling people what you do and how you can help. Customers care more about the results you can deliver than how fancy your branding is. I remember my first blog design was so basic, but that didn’t stop me from writing and sharing. I focused on the content and improving along the way. Getting started is the most important step, and I think improvements, upgrades, and a more expensive marketing strategy can come later for many types of businesses. 4. Learn as you go (with free resources) When I started my business, I learned as much as I could with free resources. This means that I signed up for every free workshop, free training, and free ebook, and I read every blog post you can think of. I don’t think you need a college degree or expensive courses to start a business. I’m a big fan of learning as you go. There are so many free resources available online to help you gain skills, learn new tools, and improve how you run your business. Some of these free resources are better than paid programs too. Here are a few you might try: YouTube tutorials on everything from setting up a website to finding clients Free online courses from Coursera or Skillshare (with a free trial) Podcasts on marketing, freelancing, and business growth Blogs and newsletters from entrepreneurs in your field Borrow books from your local library. There’s even a how to start a business with no money book that you could start with! When I first started blogging, I googled everything. I didn’t know how to start a blog or grow an audience, but I learned by reading articles, testing things, and staying consistent. And I didn’t always get it right on the first try, but I stuck with it. That’s what matters. You don’t have to be perfect. You just have to be willing to try, adjust, and keep going. 5. Trade skills or barter If there’s something you need to get started, you may want to try bartering or trading skills. Let’s say you want a logo but can’t afford a graphic designer. Can you trade writing help or another service in exchange? Maybe you know how to set up a website and someone else needs that in exchange for photography. These kinds of skill swaps can be super helpful when you’re starting out and don’t have money to spend. Bartering is also a great way to start building relationships with other business owners. You may even find long-term collaborators or referral partners this way. Here’s how to make a barter deal work: Be clear on what you’re offering and what you need in return Agree on a timeline and deliverables Put the agreement in writing so everyone is on the same page Just be sure to clearly define what each person is trading and follow through on your end. You want to build a reputation for being reliable and honest. 6. Reinvest your profits Once you start making money, reinvesting those first earnings can help you grow. That might mean buying a domain name, setting up a more professional website, or investing in software to make your business run smoother. You might also start using tools like email marketing platforms (I like Kit for my email newsletter), paid ads, or taking a paid course. When I first started making money through my blog, I reinvested as much as I could. I upgraded my hosting, bought better tools, and hired help when I could afford it. It can be tempting to spend your first profits on something fun or to celebrate, and I definitely think you should treat yourself in some way. But if you want to turn your side hustle into a full-time income, putting those early dollars back into your business will help you grow faster. Note: If you are still working your full-time job, then reinvesting your profits from your new business idea is much more possible because you are most likely already able to pay your monthly bills. By reinvesting your profits, you may be able to grow at a much faster pace. I know several business owners who set aside a specific percentage each month, such as 50%, and use it to pump growth back into their business, for example. 7. Your mindset is important too Starting a business with no money isn’t just about the steps above – it’s about your mindset too. You might feel behind or worry that you’re not ready. That’s normal. But remember, so many successful businesses started from nothing. I’ve talked to readers and entrepreneurs who built their businesses while broke, laid off, or going through personal challenges. The common theme? They believed in what they were doing. Mindset doesn’t mean you won’t feel scared – it just means you keep going anyway. You’ll learn to see failure as part of the process, not the end of the road. You’ll understand that success isn’t instant, but it’s worth the effort. If you wait until everything is perfect, you may never start. So begin with what you have and where you are, and trust that you’ll figure it out. Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about how to start a business with no money. Can I really start a business with $0? Yes, you can actually start a business if you have $0. It may take a little more time and creativity, but many people have done it – including myself. You’ll need to be willing to start with free platforms, bartering for services, networking, and more. What is the easiest business to start with no money? A service-based business is usually the easiest way to start a business with little to no money. This is because you only need your time and skills to get started. Things like freelance writing, tutoring, and virtual assistant work are great options for starting a business from home with no money. Many of them require little to no setup beyond creating a social media profile or an easy-to-make website. How do I start a business if I don’t have money? To start a business if you have no money, I recommend that you use the tools you already have and focus on selling services, using free marketing tools (like social media), and reinvesting your first earnings. What if I don’t have any skills? You probably have more skills than you realize. And if not, you can learn. There are free tutorials, courses, and guides on almost every topic online. Think about what friends or coworkers ask you for help with – that’s usually a clue. If you’re not sure if your business will make any sales, you could try validating your business idea with a Kickstarter campaign or even by taking preorders. This can be a good way to see if people are interested. How do I find clients or customers for free? To find customers for free, I recommend that you start with your personal network, post in Facebook groups, create social media profiles, and join sites like freelancing platforms. For example, in Facebook groups, you can share helpful tips and build relationships, all while getting your name out there. How to start a business with no money as a teenager?

Customers care more about the results you can deliver than how fancy your branding is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI remember my first blog design was so basic, but that didn’t stop me from writing and sharing. I focused on the content and improving along the way.

I upgraded my hosting, bought better tools, and hired help when I could afford it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt can be tempting to spend your first profits on something fun or to celebrate, and I definitely think you should treat yourself in some way. But if you want to turn your side hustle into a full-time income, putting those early dollars back into your business will help you grow faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNote: If you are still working your full-time job, then reinvesting your profits from your new business idea is much more possible because you are most likely already able to pay your monthly bills. By reinvesting your profits, you may be able to grow at a much faster pace. I know several business owners who set aside a specific percentage each month, such as 50%, and use it to pump growth back into their business, for example.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e7.

This is because you only need your time and skills to get started. Things like freelance writing, tutoring, and virtual assistant work are great options for starting a business from home with no money.

And if not, you can learn. There are free tutorials, courses, and guides on almost every topic online. Think about what friends or coworkers ask you for help with – that’s usually a clue. If you’re not sure if your business will make any sales, you could try validating your business idea with a Kickstarter campaign or even by taking preorders.
