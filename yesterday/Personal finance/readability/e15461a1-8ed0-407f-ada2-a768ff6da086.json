  "text": "The cost to remove a tree typically ranges between $200 and $2,000, with an average price of $750. What you’ll pay depends on several factors, including tree species, size, condition, location and accessibility.Your actual costs may be as low as $150 for the simple removal of a very small tree — or as much as $10,000 for a complex removal job for a very large or difficult-to-remove tree.Factors that affect tree removal costsEach tree removal job has specific challenges. Multiple factors determine final costs: Height: The taller the tree, the more you can expect to pay for its removal. Many tree removal companies charge by the foot. Species: Some types of trees are more difficult to remove than others, and the harder it is to remove a particular tree species, the more the job will generally cost. For example, an aspen may be more expensive to remove than a pine because of its connected root system.Condition: If the tree is damaged or rotting, it may require extra supports for safety, increasing the cost of removal.Accessibility: If the tree you need to remove is difficult to access because it’s too close to structures, power lines or other trees, your removal cost can increase by 25% to 50%.Urgency: An emergency tree removal that needs to be done immediately to prevent further property damage or injury, such as when a tree falls on your home or car or is about to. Urgent removals typically cost more than a non-emergency job where the time frame is more flexible.Location: If you live outside of your tree service’s usual area of operation, you may be charged an additional mileage fee.Services involved in a basic tree removal job may include cutting the trunk into smaller sections and cutting and removing branches, leaving only a stump where the tree used to be. Stump grinding, trunk hauling, chipping, trunk splitting and other services may come with additional costs. When hiring a tree service, make sure to get a very clear list of what your estimate includes.How to remove a treeWhile each tree removal is unique, most involve the same basic steps. A tree removal company will likely do the following:Assess the tree to determine safety concerns, such as leaning and dead branches. Clear the area around the tree by removing snow, brush, smaller trees and fallen branches.Remove branches from the tree.Cut the trunk down, making sure it falls away from any structures.Cut up the fallen trunk and branches into smaller sections for removal.Remove the stump, if necessary, with a shover or stump grinder.Clean up all branches and debris.Can I remove a tree myself?Tree removal is very dangerous work, so unless you have a lot of experience or the tree is small enough that you don’t need a ladder to reach its uppermost branches, it’s safer to bring in a professional. Trying to cut down a tree yourself can result in injuries from falling, chainsaw recoil or decaying wood landing on you. Additionally, you risk damaging property, creating possible power interruptions and even incurring lawsuits if you incorrectly estimate where the tree will fall.How to choose a tree removal company Choose a certified arborist. Certified arborists must complete training with the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA). You can find a certified arborist near you and check their ISA credentials at Treesaregood.org. Some tree removal companies have a certified arborist on staff and will require them to visit your property before quoting the job. Confirm that any tree service you’re considering hiring has proper insurance, will conform to the latest industry standards, and will comply with local permitting and licensing regulations.Get multiple pricing estimates. If you need cleanup or stump removal, make sure your estimate includes those services.Always sign a written contract before proceeding with work.Find out if others have been satisfied with the work of any tree service you’re considering. Check out the business with the Better Business Bureau, get references from people you know and read public reviews.When to remove a tree Sometimes, a tree can’t or shouldn’t be saved by trimming or pruning. Here are some of the most common reasons to remove a tree:The species is invasive, undesirable or prone to breakage, debris accumulation and shallow roots that damage pavement and lawns.The tree is diseased or infested.The tree is leaning more than 15% from vertical.Over 50% of the tree is damaged.More than 50% of the tree’s root system is damaged.The trunk is rotting or has a large fungus growth at its base.The trunk is severely damaged, and over 25% contains vertical cracks, seams, large old wounds or dead branch stubs.One-third or more of the tree is hollow or rotten.More than 25% of the tree’s branches are dead or damaged.All the dead branches on a tree are on only one side.Sprouts are growing from the base of the tree.The tree is impacting the health of nearby trees.Frequently asked questionsHow long will it take to have a tree removed from my property?A small tree removal should take only a few hours. However, a medium-sized tree removal may take between four to eight hours, and a very large tree removal might involve up to two eight-hour working days. The size, location and accessibility of the tree affect the time it takes to remove it.How can I time my tree removal to save money?If safety permits, it may be cheaper to wait until late winter or early spring to have your tree removed, because all the leaves will have fallen and the tree will weigh less.Do I need to get a permit to get my tree removed?It depends on where you live. Each area has its own regulations for tree removal, and some towns do require permits for this job. Ask your tree service if you’ll need a permit, or contact your city or town government to find out if one is required.Can I get financing for a home repair or improvement?Your contractor may offer some financing options (either through a partner or a payment plan), but there are other — any maybe better — financing options available.Home equity loan or HELOCHome equity loans or home equity lines of credit (HELOC) may have lower interest rates than financing with an installer, as well as future opportunities for refinancing and possible tax benefits.With a home equity loan, you receive a lump-sum payment and then pay it back at a fixed interest rate over an agreed period of time, typically five to 30 years. HELOCs are more akin to a credit card, something you use as needed. You’ll usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit, during which time you only have to pay interest, and after that you pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time. And with each of these options, you're using your home as collateral.Many banks, credit unions and online lenders offer personal loans, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000 and with fixed annual percentage rates. You receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. Unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral. This means your home isn’t at risk if you miss payments, but you’ll still have to pay late fees and the late payments can negatively impact your credit.Credit cards are an option for lower cost repairs or renovations. That’s because credit cards typically charge higher interest rates than home equity loans, HELOCs and personal loans. When used responsibly, credit cards can come with great benefits, such as 0% introductory APR periods that allow you to avoid interest for a set number of months; rewards so you can earn cash back, travel or points; and sign-up bonuses that can give you some extra cash back or rewards for a larger purchase. If you go this route, you’ll want to make sure you pick one of the best credit cards for home improvements. Which financing option is best for me?The best financing option for you will depend on how much money you need, when you need the money, what project you’re doing and how long you need to pay the money back. If it’s something that’ll add value to your home, a HELOC or home equity loan may be your best option because the value of your house could increase by more than the amount of the loan.On the flip side, if it’s a less expensive repair, a credit card is probably your best option if you want to pay no interest or earn rewards. Personal loans can apply to both small and large repairs or renovations, and they may make sense if you don’t have much equity in your home.Some home improvement contractors offer their own financing options. Before taking this option, shop around and see how their offer compares with other loans.Regardless of what you choose, make sure you compare interest rates, terms and fees with any financing options you’re considering. This will ensure you get the best deal.",

HELOCs are more akin to a credit card, something you use as needed. You’ll usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit, during which time you only have to pay interest, and after that you pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time. And with each of these options, you\u0026#39;re using your home as collateral.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMany banks, credit unions and online lenders offer personal loans, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000 and with fixed annual percentage rates. You receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. Unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral. This means your home isn’t at risk if you miss payments, but you’ll still have to pay late fees and the late payments can negatively impact your credit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCredit cards are an option for lower cost repairs or renovations. That’s because credit cards typically charge higher interest rates than home equity loans, HELOCs and personal loans. When used responsibly, credit cards can come with great benefits, such as 0% introductory APR periods that allow you to avoid interest for a set number of months; rewards so you can earn cash back, travel or points; and sign-up bonuses that can give you some extra cash back or rewards for a larger purchase. If you go this route, you’ll want to make sure you pick one of the best credit cards for home improvements. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch3 data-currency=\"Text\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhich financing option is best for me?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe best financing option for you will depend on how much money you need, when you need the money, what project you’re doing and how long you need to pay the money back. If it’s something that’ll add value to your home, a HELOC or home equity loan may be your best option because the value of your house could increase by more than the amount of the loan.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOn the flip side, if it’s a less expensive repair, a credit card is probably your best option if you want to pay no interest or earn rewards. Personal loans can apply to both small and large repairs or renovations, and they may make sense if you don’t have much equity in your home.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSome home improvement contractors offer their own financing options.
