Free gift cards can be a great way to enjoy your favorite sandwiches without spending money. These cards let you get tasty subs at no cost to you, so it’s like getting free food! There are many ways to get your hands on free Subway gift cards. You can earn them by taking surveys, watching videos, shopping online, and more. If you’re looking to enjoy free Subway meals, you’re in the right place! I’ve personally earned over $1,000 in free gift cards using sites listed in this article, so I know that it’s possible. Best Ways To Get Free Subway Gift Cards Here’s a quick list before we begin: Fetch Rewards PrizeRebel Branded Surveys Survey Junkie Prime Opinion HeyCash  Five Surveys KashKick Below are the best ways to get a free Subway gift card. 1. Fetch Rewards Fetch Rewards is a free app that gives you gift cards for scanning your grocery receipts. It’s super easy to use and works with almost any store. I use Fetch Rewards all the time and I most recently used it today. I earn points on all of my grocery receipts and it only takes a quick moment to do. When you go shopping, you just take a picture of your receipt with your phone. The app gives you points for each receipt you scan (from any store no matter what you buy). You can earn more points by buying certain brands or products (such as a specific brand of pasta sauce or a carton of eggs). You don’t need to do anything special while shopping. Just buy what you normally would and after you’re done, open the app and take a photo of your grocery receipt. You can scan receipts from grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations, and more. You can even earn points on the Fetch Rewards app for spending money at Subway! Once you have enough points, you can trade them for gift cards, such as Subway (you can get gift cards in the amounts of $5, $10, $25, and $50). There are lots of other choices, like Amazon, Target, and Starbucks. You can also use your points to help charities if you want. You have 14 days to scan your receipts, but I always just scan mine right when I hop into my car so that I don’t forget. The app also lets you scan up to 35 receipts in a week. You can sign up for Fetch Rewards by clicking here. Recommended reading: Fetch Rewards Review Here are the free Subway gift cards you can get from PrizeRebel. 2. PrizeRebel PrizeRebel is a rewards website where you can earn points by doing things like watching videos, taking surveys, and signing up for offers to earn points.

PrizeRebel is user-friendly and doesn’t cost anything to join. You can start earning points right away after you sign up. Sign up for PrizeRebel by clicking here. 3. Branded Surveys Branded Surveys is a great way to earn free Subway gift cards. You can sign up for free and start taking surveys right away. The site is easy to use. You just answer questions about products and services. Each survey can pay between 50 cents and $5, depending on how long it takes. You can earn points in other ways too. There’s a daily poll that gives you 5 points. You can also invite friends to join and get bonus points. Once you have 500 points, you can cash out. That’s equal to $5. You can choose a Subway gift card (with a value of anywhere from $5 to $250) or other rewards like PayPal cash. Sign up for Branded Surveys here and receive a free 100-point sign-up bonus.

Some take just a minute and are short surveys, while others might take half an hour (but you get paid the same amount no matter the length of time it takes you to finish it). You can pick the ones that fit your schedule. Five Surveys asks about all sorts of things. For example, they might want to know how often you go shopping (once a week or every day?) or what kind of snacks you like. The best part? You don’t have to wait forever to get your money. As soon as you finish five surveys, you can cash out. You can get your earnings through PayPal, bank transfer, or even gift cards to places like Subway, Walmart, or Apple.
