People are excited to start a blog, but they feel… When someone asks me how to start a blog, one of the first questions they usually follow up with is: “But what should I blog about?” If that sounds like you, just know you’re not alone as I get questions like this all the time. People are excited to start a blog, but they feel stuck choosing a blog topic. I completely understand because there are so many possibilities, and that can make it feel overwhelming. The good news is that there’s no one right answer. Your blog can be about anything you want it to be. And yes, even blogs about dogs or spreadsheets can make money and attract readers. When I first started Making Sense of Cents, I didn’t know where it would go (or what I was doing). I just knew I loved talking about money and wanted to share my journey. I was paying off my student loans and figured I’d write about that. Over time, my blog grew, and I was able to turn it into my full-time business. I never imagined that one decision – to start writing about something I cared about – would lead to where I am today. So if you’re not sure, that’s completely normal. Everyone starts somewhere. Today, I want to help you narrow down the blog topics you’re interested in and feel confident about what to blog about. Whether you want to blog as a hobby or turn it into a full-time business, these steps will help you find the right blog topic for you. Note: If you’re interested in blogging, I recommend joining my How To Start A Blog FREE Course. In this free course, I teach you how to start a blog, from the technical side to earning your first income and attracting readers. Over 80,000 people have taken my free course! The Best Ways To Decide What To Blog About Below is how to choose a blog niche. Recommended reading: The 25 Most-Asked Blogging Questions To Get You Started Today 1. Think about your passions and expertise The very first thing I recommend is to ask yourself: What do I love? What do I already spend time thinking about, reading about, or doing? Blogging about something you’re passionate about makes a huge difference. It keeps you motivated and excited to write. Even if you don’t consider yourself an expert, your personal experience and interest in a topic can go a long way. Here are some questions to help you brainstorm: What do you talk about with your friends? What are your favorite blogs currently? What hobbies or interests do you have? What are people always asking you for advice about? Is there something you’ve gone through that you can help others with? If you’re knowledgeable or simply curious about a subject, that’s a great starting point. I know many, many bloggers who started with no formal experience and now run successful blogs because they were open about learning along the way. Readers love authenticity, not perfection. 2. Brainstorm blog topic ideas One of the most helpful things you can do is just let your creativity flow. So I recommend that you do a brainstorming session where you just sit down and think about blog niche ideas. Some blog topic ideas include (some are more broad and some are more specific): Personal finance Lifestyle Travel Food Minimalist living Homesteading Organization and decluttering Paying off debt Financial independence / FIRE Movement RV life or van life Traveling with kids Homeschooling Parenting and family Skincare Tech DIY projects Interior design Home improvement Mental health and self care Remote work and freelancing Etsy or handmade business tips Gluten-free cooking Gardening Pet care and training DIY crafts Photography Tiny house living Keto diet Self-improvement and personal development Home decor Entertainment Knitting Fashion and beauty Relationship and personal growth Sustainable living Creative hobbies (like bullet journaling and scrapbooking) Real estate tips College life Moving abroad or expat life Fitness and health Small business This isn’t about choosing the “perfect” idea. It’s about getting a clear picture of what excites you. You might find that your ideas fall under one main category or that a few themes keep showing up. And yes, you can blog about more than one topic. Many lifestyle blogs cover a few areas, like motherhood and home organization, or travel and budgeting. I think the key to writing about more than one topic is to find ways to connect them. For example, I talk about many topics on my blog (working from home, travel, minimalism, etc.), but I always try within the blog post to tie it back to money in the end.

Research and analyze your ideas Once you have a few top blog topic ideas, it’s time to do a little research to make sure that people will want to read your blog. You can start with tools like: Google Trends: See if interest in your topic is growing. Pinterest Trends: Great for lifestyle, DIY, money, home, food, and a ton of other topics. AnswerThePublic: Shows what questions people are asking. You should also think about how you’ll make money with your blog too. For example: Can you promote affiliate products with this blog niche? Could you create a digital product down the line? Do brands in this space work with bloggers through advertising? How do you plan to get blog traffic? Where is your target audience? Facebook, SEO and keyword research, Instagram, TikTok? Not every blog needs to make money, but if that’s a goal for you, it’s smart to think about it early on.

Narrow down your blog niche Okay, so this is probably my favorite exercise to do when it comes to deciding what to blog about. I tell everyone to do this because I think it’s so incredibly helpful! By now, you should have a few top contenders for your blog niche. So, now it’s time to make a decision. Try this challenge: Pick 2-3 of your favorite blog topic ideas. For each one, write down at least 5 blog post ideas. It may take some time to think of 5, and that’s normal. So, take your time and really brainstorm. For example, if the blog niche you’re interested in writing about is personal finance, then you may brainstorm some possible blog post ideas like: How I Paid Off $30,192 in Student Loans in 2 Years 5 Budgeting Methods and How To Choose the Right One for You What I Wish I Knew Before Getting My First Credit Card Side Hustles That Helped Me Save for a House How To Build an Emergency Fund When You’re Living Paycheck to Paycheck Here’s another example: If you want to write about travel, then you may brainstorm blog post ideas like: How I Found Remote Work So I Could Travel Full-Time How I Traveled to 5 Countries in One Month 10 Things I Wish I Knew Before Booking My First Solo Trip The Best Travel Credit Cards I Use To Earn Free Flights How To Pack Light for a 2-Week Trip (Carry-On Only) And here’s one more example, this time about food: The Best Pantry Staples To Keep for Quick, Healthy Meals 10 Easy Weeknight Dinners You Can Make in Under 30 Minutes How I Meal Plan for a Family of Four on a Budget Beginner’s Guide to Freezer Cooking (With Recipes!) How I Switched to Gluten-Free and What I Eat in a Day If you can easily come up with ideas, that’s a great sign. If you’re struggling to hit even five, though, it may not be the right fit. Some questions to ask yourself when you’re done: Which blog topic felt easiest? Which one excited you the most? Can I write about this topic for years to come? Would I get bored after 5 blog posts? 5. Start your blog Now that you’ve chosen your blog topic, it’s time to take the next big step – actually starting your blog! This is where the fun really begins. You’ve done the brainstorming, you’ve narrowed it down, and you’re feeling excited about your niche. So, don’t let fear or perfectionism hold you back. You don’t need to have everything figured out right now. What matters most is getting started and learning as you go. You can always change the direction of your blog niche later. Crazy story – I have had a few blog readers who have been emailing me every so often for several years, always thinking about a possible blog niche. I always give them tips, but also tell them that they are overthinking it (they know this as well). Sometimes, you just have to start and you can always pivot later on! If you haven’t already, I highly recommend checking out my free tutorial on How To Start A Blog on WordPress. In it, I walk you through what you need to know – from picking a domain name and signing up for web hosting to designing your site. This is the next step! Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about how to determine what to blog about. What is a blog niche? A blog niche is the main topic or focus of your blog. It’s what you’ll be writing about in your blog posts and on social media. For example, your niche might be personal finance, parenting, food, travel, or even something super specific like gluten-free recipes for toddlers. My blog niche is personal finance and making money. What are the most profitable blog niches? Some of the most profitable niches include personal finance, health and wellness, online business, lifestyle, parenting, travel, and food. There are many, many more as well! I have friends who write about very specific niches and do well. These blog niches usually have large audiences and lots of different ways to make money (such as affiliate marketing, sponsored partnerships, physical products, courses, etc.). Can I blog about many topics on one blog, or should I focus on just one? You can definitely blog about more than one topic on a blog, especially if they connect well. I usually, at the very least, recommend that they make sense together. For example, a blog about travel and saving money while traveling fit together, but a blog about lizards and your favorite TV shows may not. Should I start multiple blogs at once? I highly recommend starting with just one blog. Managing multiple blogs is a lot of work, especially in the beginning. Do you have to be an expert or have a degree? Nope! As long as you’re honest, helpful, and sharing your own experiences, you can be successful. The only exception is when giving legal, medical, or specific financial advice – in those cases, expertise matters and you should always be honest about who you are. What are some unique blog ideas? Some unique blog niches include living on a sailboat, van life with pets, tiny house living, gardening in small spaces, homeschooling, postpartum fitness, remote work from Alaska, retiring early, eco-friendly fashion, digital nomad families, or even vintage toy collecting. What is the best niche for blogging? The best niche for blogging is the one that you enjoy writing about and that helps others. I don’t think there is one best niche that fits everyone. If it makes you excited to write and you can help someone in the process, that’s a win. What is the best niche for blogging with low competition? The best niche for blogging with low competition will require some research. You may want to look for micro-niches: specific angles within a broader topic. For example, instead of just “fitness,” try “postpartum workouts at home for busy moms.” These smaller niches usually have less competition and can attract a loyal audience. How To Decide What To Blog About – Summary I hope you enjoyed my article on the best ways to decide what to blog about. Starting a blog is so much fun, and I still remember when I started mine many years ago. It was a lot of work in the beginning, with lots of big decisions (what will I blog about? What will I name my blog? etc.) and it’s one of the best things I’ve ever done in life. I have made over $5,000,000 blogging over the years. I get to work from home, I have a flexible schedule, and I am my own boss. If you’re interested in blogging, then do it! Choosing what to blog about doesn’t have to be scary. And you don’t have to get it perfect with your new blog. You can pick a topic that excites you, one that you can see yourself writing about often, and just begin. You can always adjust as you grow.
