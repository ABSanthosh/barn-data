I’ve been freelancing for over a decade, and over the past year, I’ve taken on more freelance work than ever before. And, I’m really, really loving freelancing! What I love about freelancing… Are you looking for the best freelance sites to find jobs? If you’ve been wanting to start freelancing, this article is for you. I’ve been freelancing for over a decade, and over the past year, I’ve taken on more freelance work than ever before. And, I’m really, really loving freelancing! What I love about freelancing is how flexible it can be. Whether you want to make a little extra income on the side or build a full-time business, there are jobs out there for everyone. You don’t need a ton of experience either. In fact, I’ve taught myself everything through free resources like YouTube and online courses. Today, I’m sharing the best freelance platforms I’ve found, including where to start if you’re brand new, which ones are beginner-friendly, and what to expect from each. These sites have helped me land great clients and make income all from home. Best Freelance Sites To Find Jobs Below are the best freelance sites to find jobs to make money from your laptop. Recommended reading: 16 Best Freelance Jobs \u0026 How To Get Started 1. Upwork Upwork is a freelancing site where you can find jobs, even if you have no experience. You get the chance to connect with entrepreneurs and small businesses that are hiring for their companies. You can find jobs in areas like graphic design, marketing, project management, writing, programming, and more. Now, while I do like this platform and I have personally found great jobs on this platform, Upwork is kind of controversial. So my piece of advice is to build your skills with jobs on Upwork, but don’t stay there for years, as there are drawbacks to getting paid through Upwork. Upwork currently takes a 15% fee on everything you earn, which seriously adds up and hurts your earnings big time. To get jobs via Upwork, you send “proposals” (that cost you “connects,” which cost money to buy) to companies that are hiring, and give your proposed rate, resume, and why they should hire you. Yes, it costs money to apply to jobs, but it does crack down on the amount of spam applications that job postings get. I’ve landed quite a few jobs on Upwork, and it’s true that the more jobs and reviews you have listed on your profile, the easier it is to get jobs in the long run.  You can learn more about Upwork at How To Make Money On Upwork For Beginners. 2. Fiverr Fiverr is similar to Upwork, as it’s an online marketplace for freelancers where you can sell your services. It’s one of the best freelance sites to find jobs for beginners too. Fiverr has a gig-based structure, so instead of bidding on jobs like on Upwork, you create listings on your profile. This could be something like, “I’ll create a high-quality website for $1,500” or “I’ll proofread your book for $1,000.” Yes, so even though the website is called Fiverr, that does not mean that you can only charge $5 for your service. You can price your services at whatever you want to price them at. This platform covers areas in all kinds of freelancing categories such as graphic design, writing, video editing, voiceovers, programming, marketing, and more. The downside of Fiverr is that they take 20% of whatever the freelancer earns. Ouch!  Like I mentioned with Upwork, it’s not a bad idea to start on a freelancing site, but I wouldn’t stay there long-term. That 15%-20% adds up really quickly after all! You can learn more about Fiverr at How To Make Money On Fiverr For Beginners. 3. PeoplePerHour PeoplePerHour is a freelancing program that connects freelancers with businesses and entrepreneurs who are hiring for short-term gigs and long-term projects. This platform is quite popular in Europe compared to the U.S. This platform is similar to Fiverr in that you list service packages on the website. A service could be “I’ll write a 2,000-word blog post for $500.” There are also job listings where clients post projects and freelancers send proposals, similar to Upwork.  There’s also an AI feature where, when clients post a job, PeoplePerHour suggests freelancers automatically. 4. Guru Guru is a site for freelancers and businesses to connect across many different categories. It’s not as well-known as Upwork or Fiverr, but you can still find some solid long-term contracts. On Guru, clients post projects and freelancers bid proposals on them.  Guru is a bit different from the other sites I’ve mentioned because they have a project workspace called “WorkRooms” similar to project management tools like Notion and ClickUp. This platform is much less crowded than Upwork, so it may be easier to find work if you’re a new freelancer. 5. Toptal Toptal is not for beginners per se, but I did want to include it in this list in case you’re a high achiever shooting for the stars. Toptal is a high-end freelancing platform that only accepts a very limited number of people into their platform. They’re looking for people in fields like software development, design, finance, product management, and project management.  There’s a rigorous screening process to get into Toptal’s freelancing platform, which includes a language and personality assessment, timed skill tests, live interviews, and test projects (remember, it is a high-end platform so they only want high-quality people applying). If you’re accepted, you’ll likely find work with well-funded startups, Fortune 500 companies, and global brands with starting rates going from $60 to $150 per hour, depending on the skill. Projects are usually long-term or high-level consulting.  This is a picture of my home office, which I use for my freelancing work. 6. FlexJobs FlexJobs is a paid job board that connects freelancers to remote, hybrid, part-time, and full-time flexible jobs from real companies. Yes, it is a paid job board, meaning there’s a small fee to apply to jobs that are listed on FlexJobs. This is because every single job is hand-screened for scams. FlexJobs also gives you extra support, like resume reviews, skills tests, and career coaching. You can find jobs across many industries, including content writing, graphic design, software development, and project management. I think FlexJobs is a good option for people looking for long-term work and who don’t want to have to bid on or use a gig-based platform or pay a fee every time they apply for a job. You can learn more about FlexJobs by clicking here. 7. Facebook Facebook can be a good platform for freelancers because it is great for networking. No, it’s not a job board like Upwork or FlexJobs, but you can connect with people and market your services. You can use your personal Facebook page, a Facebook business page, and Facebook groups to find freelance opportunities. For example, there are many freelance-specific groups where clients can post job listings and freelancers sell their services. Or, you could be active in a Facebook group related to your freelancing skill, and provide lots of value (what I’m saying here is don’t be annoying and just sell your services in groups – answer people’s questions with real helpful answers!). People may then ask you if you sell your services, which is when you can pitch them. You can also create a Facebook page and post your freelancing services there, although this would require a lot of work and upkeep, especially in the beginning. This is the most ideal option if you’re opening a small business for your skills, like a virtual assistance agency. 8. LinkedIn LinkedIn is a great site for freelancers looking to network and find high-quality work. Since LinkedIn is a professional networking site and not a job board, you can list your qualifications in your profile and connect with potential clients for free. There’s no fee for sending people messages and networking online. You can use LinkedIn to your advantage by creating a personal brand and sharing relevant content on your profile, along with writing posts and talking to people in your field. Having your LinkedIn profile up-to-date can help potential clients find you and see your profile too. Yes, before a business hires you, they may look at your LinkedIn profile, so I do think that it is helpful to have. 9. Taskrabbit Taskrabbit is a unique site where “Taskers” help people with tasks, such as home repairs or personal assistance. Taskrabbit isn’t focused on digital work, but more so on physical work and local services. You can sell services in fields like moving or assembling furniture, cleaning, delivery, handyman work, and more. But, sometimes, you can find online freelancing work there as well, which someone may need in your local area too (for example, a local company may ask for quick in-person help with web development). Once you sign up as a Tasker, you’ll create a profile highlighting your services and tasks you’re willing to do. Taskrabbit takes around 15% of your earnings. This is a great platform if you’re looking for more hands-on, local work.  10. Freelancer Freelancer is a platform where freelancers can find jobs in writing, designing, programming, marketing, and other areas similar to the platforms I’ve already mentioned. You can sell both fixed-price and hourly projects, and freelancers bid on projects by proposing their services and rates.  There are a lot of different projects available for both beginners and people who’ve been in the field for a while. Personally, I wouldn’t recommend Freelancer as much as Upwork because the bidding system can be quite competitive if you’re brand new to the field. They also charge a service fee of around 10% to 20% of all earnings. But, it is still a decent option for someone looking for freelancing jobs online. 11. We Work Remotely We Work Remotely promotes itself as the largest job board for freelancers and remote work. This platform connects freelancers with remote opportunities around the world and has a wide range of job categories, with part-time and full-time gigs available. Similar to FlexJobs, We Work Remotely has gone through all of the job listings on their site, which means all positions posted are legit – so you won’t be wasting your time with scams (which unfortunately, can be the case for some job boards like Indeed). 12. JustRemote JustRemote is a remote job board for freelancers looking for fully remote or partially remote jobs in fields like design, development, marketing, customer service, and more. One of the standout features of JustRemote is its Power Search tool, which allows you to find remote job opportunities that are not widely advertised elsewhere. Companies have to pay to advertise their jobs, and this is expensive, so most companies promote less than a third of their open vacancies on job boards. JustRemote hunts down the remaining jobs not posted on a job board and makes it accessible to their users so you’re getting in on opportunities that aren’t posted everywhere, which is very nice.  13. Indeed I mentioned Indeed earlier in this post, and you’ve likely heard of it already. Honestly, I wouldn’t spend too much time finding a freelance job on Indeed. I’ve found there are thousands of postings listed daily, and unfortunately, there are just so many scam jobs to weed through. Indeed does have the benefit of being a free job board, unlike FlexJobs, which is paid. But you’re going to spend so much time applying to jobs and sending in cover letters that I think your time is better spent on a job board that’s been curated for legitimacy.  14. Amazon MTurk Amazon MTurk is an online marketplace where companies can post tasks for freelancers to complete. These tasks range from data entry and transcription to surveys, content moderation, and more. Freelancers can browse categories of tasks and choose the ones they want to complete, earning a small amount for each task.  I honestly wouldn’t normally recommend Amazon MTurk, as they pay pennies on the dollar for tasks, so it’s really not worth your time. Your time is better spent on platforms like Upwork and Fiverr and increasing your skills so you can charge more for your services. But, some people do like using this site to find small jobs, so it’s up to you. 15. Dribbble Dribbble is an online portfolio and community for creatives, mostly designers, to showcase their work, get feedback, and find freelance opportunities. I find this website to be such a cool concept, especially if you’re a beginner because you can get constructive criticism and find jobs at the same time. This site includes both a free and a paid version, depending on how much work you want to upload, whether you want to access job listings, and if you want to gain more visibility on the platform.  16. SimplyHired SimplyHired is a job search engine that scans through different job boards, niche websites, and career pages to go through job postings. You’ll see job listings for positions worldwide, and you can also filter your job search by location, industry, salary range, and job type. Many of the job listings even have estimated salary ranges, which is really helpful in filtering out jobs that aren’t worth it at all and in identifying high-quality paying jobs. 17. 99designs 99designs is a platform for freelancers, specifically designers, who are looking for clients seeking custom design work. This platform has become one of the most popular marketplaces for graphic design services. Graphic designers can get paid for designing logos, websites, branding, and so much more. Signing up for the platform is free, but you may find competition from others who are selling similar services, so this may not be the most ideal spot if you’re brand new to design. Also, freelancers are paid upon project completion, and there’s a service fee that is based on your level and project type.  18. Behance Behance is a freelancing platform for designers, illustrators, photographers, and others to showcase their portfolios. You get to connect with clients and find freelancing portfolios with over 24 million members.  With Behance, you can create detailed project pages to display your design work, making it easy for clients to go through your work and assess your skills and style. You can list the specific services you sell, like website development or logo design. You also set your own prices, timelines, and who you work with.  19. Codeable Codeable is a freelance platform specifically for freelancers experienced in WordPress development and is one of the top freelancing websites for this area. Codeable connects clients with a network of over 700 vetted WordPress experts, selling services from theme assistance and plug-in development to e-commerce solutions and more.  If you’re someone experienced in WordPress development, this platform is a no-brainer to list your services on. All sizes of projects are worked on, including short-term projects that may only take a couple of hours to long-term work.  20. Jooble Jooble is a global search engine that goes through jobs from thousands of sources, including company websites, job boards, and recruitment agencies. This gives Jooble users a comprehensive view of all of the job positions available. The site makes it easy to filter through jobs by adjusting the distance to the workplace, salary range, employment type, and many other features, which are helpful as a freelancer. Frequently Asked Questions Below are the most commonly asked questions about the best freelance sites to find jobs. What is the best website for freelancers?  The best freelance website depends on your goals, experience, and skill set. If you’re looking for long-term work, I recommend Upwork as there is a ton of long-term, good-quality work on there, and I have personally been hired through Upwork many times over the years. If you’re looking to sell specific services, I recommend Fiverr.  What is better, Upwork or Fiverr? I don’t personally have any experience with Fiverr, but I’ll say my experience with Upwork has been great. I’m not a fan of their 15% fee policy, but it’s a great starting ground for someone with no freelancing experience and someone looking for a legit job. I’ve easily found jobs in the $25 to $30 per hour range, and they go up from there once you have experience. There are new jobs posted daily on Upwork, making it somewhat easy to find a job quickly. What is the best freelance job for beginners? The best freelance job for beginners depends on what you’re interested in and where you want to be in the long term. Something to think about is whether you enjoy graphic design, marketing, proofreading, editing, bookkeeping, transcribing, social media, copywriting, web design, etc. There are so many routes to go with freelancing, so it’s a good idea to do some research to narrow down what you might be interested in. I’ve tried several freelancing gigs, and they’ve all been self-taught, either by YouTube or an online course, so even if you are brand new, this is something you can learn. How to freelance with no experience? If you’re starting as a freelancer with no experience, I recommend picking a skill you think you’d be interested in and be willing to learn it quickly through YouTube or other resources online.  For example, let’s say you’re interested in social media work. You can get experience by doing this type of work for someone you know who has a business, or you can create a mock-up business and do a mock social media page. It’s really all about practice, getting feedback, and increasing your skills as you go. What are examples of freelance jobs? Some examples of freelance jobs include blog post writing, copywriting, logo and website design, social media graphics, video editing, SEO, calendar and inbox management, project management, and the list goes on and on. I have done many different freelance jobs such as writing, social media management, graphic design, and project management. Best Freelance Sites To Find Jobs – Summary I hope you enjoyed my article on the best freelance sites to find jobs. There are so many ways to find freelancing jobs online, even if you’re a beginner with no experience. I love freelancing because it allows me to try out different niches and find what I enjoy most, which is project management. I would’ve never even thought about project management if I didn’t get the random urge one day to apply for a project manager job on Upwork. I have tried so many freelancing gigs over the years, so my best advice is to get started now and don’t wait forever until the perfect time. There likely won’t be a perfect time, so jump into freelancing now and get started. What do you think are the best freelance sites to find jobs?

Projects are usually long-term or high-level consulting. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"651\" data-pin-description=\"my freelance desk setup\" src=\"https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/my-freelance-desk-setup-1024x651.png\" alt=\"my freelance desk setup\" srcset=\"https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/my-freelance-desk-setup-1024x651.png 1024w, https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/my-freelance-desk-setup-300x191.png 300w, https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/my-freelance-desk-setup-768x489.png 768w, https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/my-freelance-desk-setup-1536x977.png 1536w, https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/my-freelance-desk-setup-2048x1303.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/my-freelance-desk-setup.png\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is a picture of my home office, which I use for my freelancing work.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6. FlexJobs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFlexJobs is a paid job board that connects freelancers to remote, hybrid, part-time, and full-time flexible jobs from real companies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes, it is a paid job board, meaning there’s a small fee to apply to jobs that are listed on FlexJobs. This is because every single job is hand-screened for scams. FlexJobs also gives you extra support, like resume reviews, skills tests, and career coaching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can find jobs across many industries, including content writing, graphic design, software development, and project management.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think FlexJobs is a good option for people looking for long-term work and who don’t want to have to bid on or use a gig-based platform or pay a fee every time they apply for a job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/FlexJobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eYou can learn more about FlexJobs by clicking here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e7. Facebook\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFacebook can be a good platform for freelancers because it is great for networking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it’s not a job board like Upwork or FlexJobs, but you can connect with people and market your services. You can use your personal Facebook page, a Facebook business page, and Facebook groups to find freelance opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, there are many freelance-specific groups where clients can post job listings and freelancers sell their services. Or, you could be active in a Facebook group related to your freelancing skill, and provide lots of value (what I’m saying here is don’t be annoying and just sell your services in groups – answer people’s questions with real helpful answers!). People may then ask you if you sell your services, which is when you can pitch them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also create a Facebook page and post your freelancing services there, although this would require a lot of work and upkeep, especially in the beginning. This is the most ideal option if you’re opening a small business for your skills, like a virtual assistance agency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e8.

There’s no fee for sending people messages and networking online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use LinkedIn to your advantage by creating a personal brand and sharing relevant content on your profile, along with writing posts and talking to people in your field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHaving your LinkedIn profile up-to-date can help potential clients find you and see your profile too.

You can sell services in fields like moving or assembling furniture, cleaning, delivery, handyman work, and more. But, sometimes, you can find online freelancing work there as well, which someone may need in your local area too (for example, a local company may ask for quick in-person help with web development).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you sign up as a Tasker, you’ll create a profile highlighting your services and tasks you’re willing to do. Taskrabbit takes around 15% of your earnings. This is a great platform if you’re looking for more hands-on, local work. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10. Freelancer\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFreelancer is a platform where freelancers can find jobs in writing, designing, programming, marketing, and other areas similar to the platforms I’ve already mentioned. You can sell both fixed-price and hourly projects, and freelancers bid on projects by proposing their services and rates. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a lot of different projects available for both beginners and people who’ve been in the field for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, I wouldn’t recommend Freelancer as much as Upwork because the bidding system can be quite competitive if you’re brand new to the field. They also charge a service fee of around 10% to 20% of all earnings. But, it is still a decent option for someone looking for freelancing jobs online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e11.

This platform connects freelancers with remote opportunities around the world and has a wide range of job categories, with part-time and full-time gigs available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSimilar to FlexJobs, We Work Remotely has gone through all of the job listings on their site, which means all positions posted are legit – so you won’t be wasting your time with scams (which unfortunately, can be the case for some job boards like Indeed).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e12.

JustRemote hunts down the remaining jobs not posted on a job board and makes it accessible to their users so you’re getting in on opportunities that aren’t posted everywhere, which is very nice. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e13.

Honestly, I wouldn’t spend too much time finding a freelance job on Indeed. I’ve found there are thousands of postings listed daily, and unfortunately, there are just so many scam jobs to weed through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed does have the benefit of being a free job board, unlike FlexJobs, which is paid. But you’re going to spend so much time applying to jobs and sending in cover letters that I think your time is better spent on a job board that’s been curated for legitimacy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e14.

Freelancers can browse categories of tasks and choose the ones they want to complete, earning a small amount for each task. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI honestly wouldn’t normally recommend Amazon MTurk, as they pay pennies on the dollar for tasks, so it’s really not worth your time. Your time is better spent on platforms like Upwork and Fiverr and increasing your skills so you can charge more for your services. But, some people do like using this site to find small jobs, so it’s up to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e15.

If you’re looking for long-term work, I recommend Upwork as there is a ton of long-term, good-quality work on there, and I have personally been hired through Upwork many times over the years. If you’re looking to sell specific services, I recommend Fiverr. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is better, Upwork or Fiverr?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t personally have any experience with Fiverr, but I’ll say my experience with Upwork has been great. I’m not a fan of their 15% fee policy, but it’s a great starting ground for someone with no freelancing experience and someone looking for a legit job. I’ve easily found jobs in the $25 to $30 per hour range, and they go up from there once you have experience.

Something to think about is whether you enjoy graphic design, marketing, proofreading, editing, bookkeeping, transcribing, social media, copywriting, web design, etc. There are so many routes to go with freelancing, so it’s a good idea to do some research to narrow down what you might be interested in. I’ve tried several freelancing gigs, and they’ve all been self-taught, either by YouTube or an online course, so even if you are brand new, this is something you can learn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to freelance with no experience?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re starting as a freelancer with no experience, I recommend picking a skill you think you’d be interested in and be willing to learn it quickly through YouTube or other resources online. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, let’s say you’re interested in social media work.
