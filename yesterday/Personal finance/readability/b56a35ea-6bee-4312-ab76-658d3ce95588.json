You may hear hatchback cars referred to as sedans, but the structure of each vehicle type is, in fact, very different.Sedans are defined as a four-door passenger car that has a trunk separate from the passenger area. It is what’s called a three-box configuration, with separate compartments for the engine, passengers and cargo.Hatchbacks are two-door or four-door cars, with their passenger and cargo areas connected. What really sets them apart is a liftgate (or hatch) that raises up for easy access to the cargo area. The hatch is sometimes referred to as a third or fifth door, and the hatchback is called a two-box configuration.Because of their differences, hatchbacks and sedans each have advantages and disadvantages, which can help you decide which is the better option for you.This Toyota Corolla is an example of a sedan ...... while Honda's Civic range includes this hatchback style.How do hatchbacks and sedans compare? Here are some differences and similarities to think about when deciding between a hatchback and sedan.Storage space and cargo: Hatchbacks are the clear winner for storage space and versatility when transporting cargo. The rear hatch door opens to create a large area for loading and unloading items easily. Also, hatchbacks have rear seats that fold down, creating more cargo space than you would find in a sedan. Even sedans with rear seats that fold down will have a more limited, less-accessible cargo space than a hatchback.Passenger space: Hatchbacks and sedans can each seat four and possibly up to five people. The comfort of those passengers is where you may find differences. Of the two, sedans tend to have more legroom, while hatchbacks have more headroom for rear passengers due to the higher roofline in the back.Size: While there isn’t a big difference in vehicle size, hatchbacks can be a bit shorter than sedans. That gives them a slight edge when it comes to manueverig in tight areas or parallel parking.Fuel efficiency: A hatchback’s design can be less aerodynamic than the same model as a sedan, resulting in marginally lower fuel efficiency. For example, the 2025 Honda Civic Sport sedan has an EPA-estimated mpg of 31 in the city, 39 on the highway and 34 for city and highway combined. The same vehicle as a hatchback has an estimated mpg of 30 city, 38 highway and 34 combined.Cost and resale value: The upfront price for a hatchback is usually slightly more than the same model as a sedan, but the difference isn’t typically a huge one. For example, the 2025 Toyota Corolla sedan has a starting MSRP of $22,175, while the hatchback is $23,630. Resale value can be a toss-up, depending on make, model and demand.Visibility: Since the rear window has a larger glass area, and the vehicle’s back is usually more vertical, drivers tend to have better visibility in a hatchback.Road noise: Sedans are usually quieter on the road than hatchbacks. Because of the connected cargo and passenger area in a hatchback, road noises can be louder.Security: If you regularly haul valuable items, a sedan may be a preferable choice. A sedan’s trunk is fully enclosed and out of sight, while a hatchback’s rear window gives visibility into the cargo area. Unless you have a cover, what’s in the cargo area is more exposed and possibly less secure.Identifying sedans vs hatchbacks can be trickyWhen you see a hatchback or sedan, it isn’t always easy to tell the difference between the two. At one time, all hatchbacks had a distinctive boxy appearance, with the liftgate easy to distinguish. Now, more modern hatchbacks — especially sportier and luxury ones — can have lower, sloping rooflines that appear to be the small trunk of a sedan. But if a passenger car’s rear door lifts up to reveal a large storage area leading into the passenger area, you’re viewing a hatchback.Should you choose a sedan or hatchback?Whether to decide on a hatchback or sedan depends on your needs. If you want a vehicle with more cargo room and visibility, and you don’t mind a slightly noisier ride, a hatchback might be more suitable for you. On the other hand, if you want more legroom, less noise and the ability to hide what you’re transporting, a sedan might be a better fit. Many car models — like the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic — are available in either a sedan or a hatchback version, so you can test drive both to see which you prefer.",
