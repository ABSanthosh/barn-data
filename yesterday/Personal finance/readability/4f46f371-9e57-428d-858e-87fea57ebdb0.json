  "text": "Executive Summary To sustain firm growth, financial advisors often face a dilemma: to focus on what originally drew them to the profession – like financial planning – they often must first do an extensive amount of business development. Marketing activities such as brand development, event planning, and content strategy often demand skills outside advisors' typical expertise and interest. Even those who do have an interest in marketing may find it challenging to dedicate the time to do it well. As a result, outsourcing parts – or even the entirety – of a marketing strategy can be a highly effective solution. However, with the range of potential solutions, it can be difficult to know where to begin. As a starting point, understanding the wide variety of marketing tasks that can be outsourced can be beneficial. Advisors might consider outsourcing roles such as social media management, search engine optimization, web development, event management, and performance analytics, among other options. Reviewing both current marketing efforts and aspirational goals for client engagement can help advisors determine where outsourcing may add the most value. From there, advisors may need to consider whom to outsource to. Quick tasks may only need a temporary contractor from platforms like Fiverr or Upwork. However, more complex needs, such as strategy and brand development, may benefit from someone with industry expertise to ensure deeper understanding with fewer revisions required. Advisors may also want to consider a contractor's communication style and marketing philosophy to assess compatibility with the firm's values. Once a contractor or firm has been hired, advisors can help set the stage for success by identifying key stakeholders and agreeing on clear definitions of success. Providing examples of effective marketing, existing guidelines, and a timeline for deliverables can establish a strong foundation. And, once work progresses, keeping an open line of communication – through email and video calls – can support feedback exchanges that help contractors align with the firm's style and voice over time. Over the long term, success can be evaluated not only by long-term campaign results but also by cultural fit and the strategic insights the marketing partner brings to the firm. Ultimately, the key point is that partnering with a skilled contractor or agency can be a win-win for both the advisor and the contractor. By freeing advisors to focus on client service and core business functions, contractors can apply their specialized expertise, often leading to more effective marketing outcomes than an advisor could achieve alone. This collaboration not only enhances the firm's marketing efforts but also allows the advisor to allocate time and energy where it's most impactful, driving growth and fostering stronger client relationships. And with the right fit, an outsourced partner's insights can help elevate the firm's brand, positioning it more effectively in a competitive market and supporting long-term success!

These demands can quickly outpace the advisor's bandwidth to lay a strong foundation for growth. Outsourcing is a booming, multi-billion-dollar industry, and marketing is just one of many areas that can be outsourced. Strategic marketing, in particular, plays a critical role in driving business growth by elevating a firm's brand and attracting new clients. Whether launching a new practice, scaling up, or reassessing the firm's current marketing efforts or partnerships, a focused marketing strategy is key to delivering consistent value to clients and sustaining growth. Unfortunately, with multiple marketing channels competing for the firm's time and attention, it's easy to feel lost, not knowing where to start. AdvisorStream reports that 80% of advisors with $100+ million in assets under management take a DIY approach to managing marketing, yet fewer than 30% have a defined marketing strategy. And while advisors who do implement a marketing strategy secure 50% more clients annually, 85% of advisors report they don't have the time to focus on marketing. The Case For Outsourcing Marketing To Unlock Growth Potential Outsourcing marketing offers significant strategic and cost advantages, such as access to specialized skills, industry trends, and support that helps firms scale their marketing efforts without stretching internal resources or derailing their mission. Many firms may recognize the need for external support to overcome obstacles and grow. Outsourcing can provide the flexibility and efficiency to move forward without the overhead costs of hiring a full-time, in-house team. Selecting the right partner might involve finding an organization to manage social media accounts or design a sleek website. However, it's also about choosing a provider that understands the firm's goals, the nuances of the financial services industry, and how to communicate effectively with its target audience. There are many options to consider before entering a new business relationship. Just as with hiring a new employee or making a strategic business shift, hiring an outsourced marketing provider should align with the firm's objectives at various stages of growth. Choosing the wrong partner could stall progress, drain resources, and result in missed opportunities or lackluster marketing efforts. For financial advisors and firms at a crossroads and seeking outsourced marketing support, we'll explore the types of marketing services to consider, the process for vetting a potential partner, and the keys to launching a successful outsourcing relationship that benefits the firm. What Marketing Services Can I Outsource? A marketing approach that communicates credibility and relevance is required to stay competitive, expand the firm's client base, and retain existing clients. But where should the firm start? There are dozens of marketing functions that can be outsourced, including the following: Marketing strategy and business consulting Brand positioning and messaging Graphic design for logos, visual assets, and more Copywriting for blogs, newsletters, case studies, white papers, and more Social media management Search engine optimization Website development or redesign Email marketing and drip emails Paid advertising Print marketing materials (e.g., brochures, business cards, flyers) Mobile apps Media outreach and placements Video production and editing Webinar management Marketing analytics Event planning Questions To Ask To Tailor An Outsourcing Strategy To determine where a firm might benefit from outsourcing, it can help to assess their current marketing efforts and identify their gaps and what they might need to reach the next level. Here are key questions that can be asked based on the firm's size and resources: Firms With Approximately 5 Employees Questions should center around establishing foundational growth strategies and identifying elements that will drive the next phase of expansion. Discussions should help the firm determine where to streamline processes and decide who should do what to ensure high-impact efforts that will support scaling effectively. Am I effectively attracting new clients and building my brand presence, or am I solely focused on referrals? Do I have a steady social media presence? Does my content deliver value that keeps clients engaged and attracts new prospects? Is my marketing activity aligned with my own growth plans, whether I stay solo or start attracting new talent? Firms With Approximately 10–30 Employees At this stage of growth, it can be difficult to maintain brand consistency across the growing organization. With AdvisorStream reporting that 62% of advisors state their current website is ineffective at generating leads, ensuring clear and unified messaging is crucial. Firms should focus on reinforcing key differentiators so internal and external communications align with the firm's positioning. Do we have consistent messaging? Is the brand positioned well to compete in the market and attract our ideal clients? How can we move to a more sophisticated, data-driven marketing approach? Are we attracting new hires with a palpable, conveyable company culture? Am I effectively nurturing existing clients? Do I have regular value-adds and touchpoints like newsletters, webinars, and client events? Is our website converting leads and providing value? Does it have a modern design and intuitive navigation that leverages SEO best practices for increased organic traffic? Are we meeting the expectations of current and future clients? Are we providing the speed clients expect? Firms With Over 30 Employees With more complexity, firms should refine marketing strategies to help ensure all employees represent and communicate the core values and mission. From developing solid brand documents to aligning hiring practices, firms should consider how to culturally embed their brand personality and structure the organization so the brand is upheld across all departments. Is our marketing activity aligned with our future growth plans? Do we have a brand personality that our team has embraced and can live out? Do we have a formalized brand book, marketing training, and access to labeled assets that the team can use? How is marketing impacting new hires? How does it spread across departments? Can we streamline processes through automation to support more extensive campaigns? How can we utilize marketing to keep a sophisticated feel and continue to leverage COIs? How do we diversify lead streams and grow organically? Once the firm has identified gaps, it can better determine which marketing services to outsource and align a provider with its goals. Here are typical outsourced services: Business Strategist: A Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), marketing consultant, fractional CMO, or marketing director can help provide high-level strategic direction, identify gaps in the firm's marketing strategy, or establish critical systems. For example, they may work with the firm's leadership to set long-term goals (e.g., like rebranding) or help align its resources and focus areas. Marketing Strategy: Intelligence Gathering: Qualitative and quantitative research can help a firm evaluate various analytics, such as which campaigns perform best or which segments to target. Brand Strategy: Defining a firm's target market, positioning statements, and Unique Value Propositions (UVPs) offers clarity and unified messaging that focuses on helping a firm stand out and attract its ideal clients. Branding: Refining a firm's brand underscores the firm's personality, mission, and values and ensures these elements are communicated well verbally and visually. This is especially important if brand assets like the firm's logo or messaging are outdated or don't reflect the brand strategy above. Organic Content: Content Creation: Producing SEO-optimized blogs as well as evergreen and timely content and newsletters, high-quality videos, and graphics helps keep firms visible while helping to engage and retain clients. For example, webinars can help engage, educate, and build trust among potential clients. Content Delivery: Effective management of the scheduling and distribution of content, such as social media and email campaigns, helps ensure content reaches the right audiences, drives engagement, and keeps the firm top of mind. Demand Generation: Landing pages, drip email campaigns, and lead funnels nurture potential clients through their engagement journey, moving them toward becoming clients. Paid Advertising: Paid social media, Google, and display ads help a firm reach a broader audience, driving traffic to its brand. What Are The Different Types Of Outsourcing Engagements? There are several different types of outsourcing engagements, each with advantages and things to consider. Here's a breakdown of the common types of outsourcing options and considerations for each: Quick Tasks And Projects. If advisors need support for short-term tasks, services like Fiverr, Upwork, and Toptal connect businesses with experts for quick work. The wide range of services may include creating a logo, designing an event flier, or producing a social media video. Pros: Work is competitively priced and typically done within a short turnaround, allowing firms to choose when to hire based on their needs. Firms can also review portfolios and feedback from past clients before engaging. Cons: Quality may vary based on a service provider's experience and how much specific input they receive from the firm. As this is more of a one-off, transaction-based approach, they will likely be unfamiliar with the firm's brand. Off-The-Shelf Solutions. Firms looking for a cost-effective way to get their marketing off the ground may have access to pre-approved content or marketing resources through their custodians or partners, such as Wells Fargo, Schwab, Dimensional Fund Advisors, or LPL Financial, or engaging with service providers such as FMG Suite that provide automated marketing solutions tailored to a specific industry. Services may include marketing strategy worksheets and templates, content, customizable templates for websites, newsletters, social media, and more. Pros: Products are typically affordable and simple to use, providing a range of industry-researched services for firms and advisors with limited time and resources. Cons: Marketing may feel “cookie-cutter” when a targeted strategy, advanced customization, and differentiation may be required to stand out. Also, firms may find themselves needing accountability or implementation support to turn the strategies and resources into action. Freelancers. Freelancers may specialize in a particular area, such as copywriting or design, or work as marketing generalists across various tasks. They often work on a retainer or hourly contract, becoming familiar with a firm's brand over time. This is ideal for firms seeking dedicated support for a specific deliverable. Pros: Deeper engagement with the firm's brand; can act like an extension of the team on a specific task allowing firms to scale up or down as needed. Cons: They may offer a limited breadth of experience or services, limiting what the firm can create and achieve. Additionally, the firm may hit roadblocks if it has communication challenges, even if the work is satisfactory. Specialty Providers. If a firm has a specific marketing need, it may benefit from engaging with specialty providers that focus on a single or specialized group of services, such as direct mail, SEO, or website development. Pros: They offer high-level expertise in their creative niche with focused solutions. Cons: Because the firm is responsible for creating and maintaining the overarching marketing objectives, efforts may feel more deliverable-focused and lack unity and integration across channels, business development, and sales efforts. It may require additional expenses and coordination if the firm needs multiple services from other providers. Marketing Agency. A full-suite marketing agency typically offers comprehensive marketing support, from branding and digital strategy to ad creation and social media management. An agency can act as an extension of the firm's team or work independently to execute the firm's entire marketing strategy. They're ideal for firms that want to delegate most of their marketing efforts or need support across multiple channels. According to Microsourcing, 52% of business leader respondents prefer working with a professional firm or agency for their structure and perceived safety. Pros: Agencies are a one-stop shop for the firm's marketing needs, providing access to a wide range of expertise, streamlined communication, and workflows. Cons: It can be one of the more expensive outsourcing options since multiple services are provided. Firms may also outgrow their agency if they need more day-to-day support managing different teams and firm functions across departments. Business Strategy Consultant: If a firm needs high-level strategy and expertise but isn't ready to hire a full-service team, a consultant might be the best choice. Consultants or fractional CMOs may manage all the firm's marketing needs or give guidance on the firm's branding, messaging, service model, fee structure, and other critical business areas and decisions that impact marketing. Pros: Consultants typically have deep industry roots, bringing knowledge, strategy, experience, and an objective outside perspective. They bring an objective look that can rally the team around goals and positioning. They may have a team or referral partners to implement the strategy and get the tactics off the ground. Cons: They can be expensive. They may be expected to be involved in day-to-day tactics that they're not set up to provide. Also, because they are set up to come in and help solve a current, presenting problem, they may not be available for long-term support. What To Consider When Choosing The Right Outsourcing Option For The Firm When choosing the right outsourcing provider, whether to bridge a short-term gap, gain specific expertise, or build a marketing plan from scratch, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons of each approach. Beyond the scope of work, firms will also benefit from considering the long-term relationship and day-to-day logistics involved. For example, they may ask if they require short-term solutions that off-the-shelf options can meet, the long-term support of an agency or freelancer, or specialized expertise from a dedicated professional. Other considerations include the firm's own size and AUM levels and how well the firm and outsourced provider can work together. Choosing An Outsourced Provider By Firm And Asset Size The size of the firm and its budget may also help inform which type of provider to choose. While assets under management can be a defining factor, the firm's employee count often better reflects the resources and bandwidth available to manage or oversee marketing initiatives. Here are some different ways that firms typically approach outsourcing: Solo Advisors and Small Firms. Smaller firms, typically managing less than $200 million in Assets Under Management (AUM), can effectively work with a freelancer, consultant, or quick-task platform to meet their marketing needs. Mid-Sized Firms. Firms with 5–10+ employees or managing around $500 million AUM are in growth mode, want to compete in the market in new and innovative ways, and are often ready to partner with an agency for enhanced marketing support. Large Firms. Firms with 20 or more employees or approaching $1 billion in AUM often have an internal marketing professional who collaborates with an agency for added professionalism, strategy, and implementation support. More than 60% of marketing teams report lacking the talent bandwidth to reach their goals alone. Multi-Office Firms: Large firms with multiple offices and billions in AUM typically take a hybrid approach, with an in-house marketing team that may partner with an agency or specialty provider to fill skill gaps and offer additional support. They typically allocate around 10–20% of their budget to outsourcing. Vetting A Potential Outsourced Marketing Provider For Fit Once the firm has identified the type of provider that fits its needs, whether a solo expert or full-service agency, evaluating what is required and expected in the partnership can be helpful. Beyond the marketing provider's skills and ability to meet the firm's budget, other factors the team can assess include the following: Cultural fit: How they need to align with the firm's values and goals and how they will reflect the voice of the firm's brand. Industry knowledge: How well they understand the nuances, challenges, and regulatory requirements of the financial services industry. Communication style: How responsive, transparent, and proactive they are. Overall marketing philosophy: Whether their approaches are data-driven, innovative, and brand-focused. It's helpful to consider these factors early to manage expectations and stay productive. The graphic below includes a list of questions that firms can discuss with their internal teams before selecting potential providers. A full version of this checklist can be downloaded here. Download The Full Checklist Key Steps To Outsourcing The Right Marketing Partner Hiring the right marketing partner is an important step in aligning the firm's marketing strategy with its overall goals. From gaining leadership support to finding the ideal partner and launching the partnership, each stage requires careful planning. The following sections outline practical steps to help firms make the best choices and build a strong and productive partnership. Gaining Leadership Buy-In Securing buy-in from key stakeholders when hiring or switching an outsourced marketing provider requires understanding leadership priorities and addressing concerns around resources, expected time requirements, and long-term value. Focusing on potential growth can help to facilitate the decision-making process and frame the partnership as a step forward. Here are approaches to help secure leadership buy-in: Start with a Test Run: Propose a limited engagement or trial period with the provider to demonstrate value with the pressures of committing to a long-term agreement. Involve Key Stakeholders: As the selection process narrows down, loop in key stakeholders, including decision-makers and leaders overseeing marketing efforts, into sales conversations to ensure the ultimate choice fits well and aligns with the firm's objectives. Highlight Business Growth: Show how the partnership relates to firm goals, such as attracting new clients, scaling, or raising brand visibility. Finding And Connecting With The Right Outsourced Marketing Partner Outsourced marketing is ideal for financial firms and advisors wanting more efficiency, cost savings, or support for an in-house team. With proactive planning, firms can begin their search with a preliminary wish list in mind by exploring avenues for finding and connecting with outsourced marketing providers, such as: Referrals: Asking for trusted referrals and recommendations from colleagues and professionals in their networks. Network: Attending industry events or marketing conferences to connect with potential agencies or freelancers in person. Research Online Platforms: Getting familiar with off-the-shelf solutions, freelance platforms, and professional sites like LinkedIn to perform targeted searches based on budget, expertise, and location. Leverage Free Consultations: Certain providers and agencies may offer a free introductory meeting to discuss the firm's needs, explain their services, and share their approach, which is a great way to see if they're the right fit. Attend a Webinar or Speaking Engagement: Attending an event can help advisors learn more about a provider's expertise, approach, and personality. Conduct an Online Search: Conducting Google searches for providers to explore their websites, client reviews, and content or portfolios to get a sense of their capabilities and reputation. Launching A Successful Outsourced Marketing Partnership Now that the firm has chosen an outsourced provider and secured leadership buy-in, what's next? The first step is establishing a clear process for delegating projects and tasks based on the firm's needs, current marketing efforts, and long-term goals. Setting clear expectations and providing essential information upfront will help minimize misunderstandings, ensure a smooth working relationship, and ultimately help the firm achieve its goals. Here are some best practices to help ensure a successful engagement with the chosen provider: Quick Tasks And Projects, Off-the-Shelf Solutions, And Freelancers. For firms looking to outsource smaller, quick-turnaround projects, freelancers, or off-the-shelf marketing solutions, the key is to simplify the process without sacrificing clarity. Since these engagements often don't require in-depth strategy, focusing on practical, efficient communication is crucial: Show them what good looks like. Share examples of previous successful work so they know what to aim for. Whether it's a high-performing social media post or a well-received blog article, showing them what the firm considers 'gold-standard' sets a benchmark for quality. Provide clear guidelines and tools. Share internal style guides, templates, and other tools to make sure their work aligns with the firm's brand voice and standards. This helps cut down on unnecessary back-and-forth and gets the project done faster. Use tools for feedback. Tools like Loom can be great for recording feedback in real time, while Acrobat Pro can make it easy to mark up PDFs with edits for particular projects. These tools streamline communication and help to keep everyone on the same page. Identify key contacts. Make sure that everyone knows who the main point of contact is and who makes the final call. Clear lines of communication help avoid confusion and ensure the project stays on track. Specialty Providers. Because they aren't always looking at the big picture and are instead laser-focused on delivering one specific solution, specialty providers may need firms to bring them back to the broader business and marketing goals. It's important to share the overall direction of the firm's marketing efforts so that the work they do contributes to the bigger picture. This approach keeps their efforts aligned with the firm's objectives. Marketing Agencies. Marketing agencies offer a more comprehensive approach, often helping firms recognize if they need stronger brand awareness, sharper messaging, or strategic direction. Firms need to be clear about their current marketing efforts and where they see room for growth. Agencies can thrive when they understand where the firm is headed and how their work can best support that journey. Being prepared to discuss what's working, where challenges exist, and how success will be measured helps agencies provide tailored solutions. Above all, open communication about how much time the firm can commit to marketing and sales efforts will help the agency focus on what's most impactful. The best engagements with outsourced marketing teams are partnerships built on transparency and shared goals. Setting expectations early ensures that everyone is working toward the same outcomes. Business Strategy Consultants. Firms should define expected deliverables at the outset of the engagement – such as identifying a target market or refining unique value propositions – and establish timelines for each stage. Clarifying the consultant's involvement at every phase of engagement compared to other resources they may use is also essential. Some consultants may pinpoint opportunities for improvement but refer or bring in specialists to implement the changes, such as those who handle website design or marketing collateral updates. Knowing what to expect early on helps the firm coordinate follow-up efforts so there are no gaps in execution. If personal interaction is a priority to the firm, it may wish to discuss expectations for in-person collaboration, such as on-site meetings with the team or if sufficient, off-site strategic sessions. Our checklist below can be used to help you interview a prospective outsourced marketing partner. A full version of this checklist can also be downloaded here. Download The Full CheckList Ensuring A Successful Partnership With An Outsourced Provider – Resources To Help Them Get Started To help the new partner hit the ground running, the firm will need to provide access to certain essential data, documents, and marketing tools. These resources will enable the partner to become familiar with the firm's brand and manage tasks independently and efficiently. While the partner may help in developing or refining some of these assets, depending on the nature of the engagement, the firm may need to provide some of the following items to help them begin delivering on the firm's goals from day one: Quick Tasks And Projects, Off-the-Shelf Solutions Contact information for a point person or chain of command for requests and approvals. Digital assets such as logos, images, and existing marketing materials. Freelancers All of the above, plus: Brand style guides, personality and voice characteristics, and visual elements for consistency in how the firm looks and sounds. Editorial and content calendars with the current production and distribution timelines for newsletters and emails and any timely content to consider, like promoting an upcoming client welcome event. Login credentials, including account usernames and passwords for tools such as social media accounts like Sprout Social and LinkedIn, project management systems like Asana, and digital storage services like Dropbox and Google Drive. Specialty Providers, Marketing Agencies, And Business Strategy Consultants All of the above, plus: Discovery meetings with key leadership to discuss the firm's current landscape, short- and long-term goals, and where the firm hopes it will be in the next 6 months, year, or several years down the line. Marketing budget for time, paid ads, and content creation. Target audience profiles, market research, client feedback or reviews, and other relevant demographic or behavioral data. Direction for compliance and regulatory requirements, such as disclosures and version control protocols. Current and past analytics from previous campaigns, CRM systems, email marketing platforms, or other software that tracks performance, such as Google Analytics. Ongoing meetings to discuss updates, ask questions, or tweak strategies as needed. How To Measure Outsourced Marketing Success Choosing a marketing partner is more than a one-and-done decision. The ongoing process should be evaluated and measured to ensure the firm's goals and needs are being met. To build a productive and successful partnership, it's important to define clear success criteria and establish Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) both at the outset and along the way, measuring how effective the provider is over time and making adjustments as needed to stay on track toward long-term goals. Success Metrics. Defining what success means will be different for every firm. While it's tempting to want to try and achieve every metric during an engagement, narrowing down to what matters most is typically more effective. For instance, a firm may focus on generating more leads or increasing revenue by targeting a higher-end market. Goals should be refined with an understanding that some metrics may be stepping stones to broader objectives. For example, driving more website traffic to a specific landing page may lead to an increase in qualified leads. Similarly, tracking ad campaigns could highlight not just the volume of leads but the conversion rate to clients as well. Media features and requests for speaking engagements could also signal success and growth. Priority Alignment. At the start of a new engagement, firms often have many ideas ready to launch. But to make the most of the partnership, it's important to set clear expectations around timeline and execution – whether for content creation, website updates, or other initiatives – so that project timeframes align with the firm's needs. Regular weekly or monthly check-ins can help ensure that projects stay on track. It's also helpful to break down the firm's objectives into short- and long-term goals. Short-term goals might focus on what the firm wants to achieve in the first 3 to 6 months, such as developing a social media strategy. By contrast, long-term goals – such as scaling, rebranding, and enhancing client development – should be planned over a broader, year-long timeframe. Timeline For Impact. Success doesn't typically occur overnight, so it's important to set realistic expectations for when the firm expects to see measurable results. Some marketing strategies require more time than others, with factors such as seasonality, trends, or unforeseen events also impacting progress. For instance, it can take months for a prospect to become a client, and about 3 to 6 months – or longer – to see significant changes in strategies like SEO search rankings and social media engagement. While it's possible to see early results, staying patient, monitoring performance, and adjusting approaches based on data and insights are key. Just like onboarding a new employee, bringing in a marketing agency or consultant is a time investment. Results may not be immediate, as they may need a few months to gain access to the firm's systems and become familiar with the brand, processes, and communication style. Cultural Fit. A lot of a provider's success comes down to how well they align with the firm. The right fit can create a natural rhythm where the firm isn't overwhelmed or underwhelmed but moves steadily toward its goals. However, a partnership can feel strained if there are unclear expectations, missed deadlines, or poor communication. It's important to assess how well the partner integrates with the team and aligns with the firm's culture. Are they proactive, open to feedback, and collaborative? Gathering team input about how well the provider gets along with people can also provide valuable insights. Strong rapport and a positive attitude can go a long way in building a successful partnership. When To Reassess Providers Or Change Marketing Approaches Understanding the firm's success criteria can also help identify when it may be time to reassess the current marketing partner, select a new provider, or choose a different approach – such as upgrading to a full-service agency. Recognizing the following potential warning signs early on can help the firm pivot before losing too many resources or momentum. One key indicator is stagnant or declining results. If there hasn't been significant progress on the key metrics defined by the team, it could be a sign that the current approach isn't delivering as expected. This might be a good time to have a conversation about the results and consider exploring other options. Another red flag is quality issues, such as consistently late deliverables or inconsistent outputs. If the new partner, whether it's a freelancer or solo expert, struggles to keep up, it may signal that they need more capacity or support to meet the firm's expectations and deliver reliable work. The firm may also outgrow its current provider if it experiences an inability to scale or notices any gaps in skills. As marketing needs become more complex, relying on providers like freelancers or off-the-shelf solutions might no longer provide the depth of expertise or resources required. As the firm grows, another important factor to consider is rapid expansion. If the firm is scaling quickly, transitioning from an outsourced marketing partner to an in-house team may make sense for more dedicated, full-time support. The firm may also need to reassess its goals if its priorities shift from task volume to more in-depth strategy refinement and brand positioning. Conversely, if the firm's priority is getting more done with a set budget but its evolving needs require greater market differentiation, this may also indicate the need for a new partner. A lack of creativity or strategic insight can also be a reason to reevaluate the partnership. Sometimes, the firm may need a more involved partner who has deeper industry knowledge and can offer fresh ideas and perspectives. This is also important when the firm begins to move upmarket and wishes to truly stand out. Differentiation needs become a priority, and a more strategic, impactful approach may be required to refine the firm's brand and messaging rather than relying on templated content and quick task services. Finally, poor communication or a mismatch in culture, values, or working style can derail productivity and collaboration. If there's a disconnect in working styles, it might be time to find a partner who better aligns with the firm's vision and team dynamic. If the firm recognizes an opportunity to streamline its marketing and work with a trusted partner to avoid potentially costly mistakes, outsourcing can be tailored to fit specific needs, whether for short-term projects or longer-term engagements. Like bringing in a new team member, the time and effort spent on upfront planning will pay off with successful short-term results or a stronger ongoing relationship. The right partner isn't just about expertise – it's about cultivating a connection that aligns with the firm's objectives and values. A strong outsourced marketing partnership can enhance marketing efforts while allowing the firm to focus on what it does best: serving clients and growing the business. With clear insights and expectations, outsourcing can unlock new opportunities for the firm's future success! Quality? Nerdy? Relevant? We really do use your feedback to shape our future content!

Marketing activities such as brand development, event planning, and content strategy often demand skills outside advisors\u0026#39; typical expertise and interest. Even those who do have an interest in marketing may find it challenging to dedicate the time to do it well. As a result, outsourcing parts – or even the entirety – of a marketing strategy can be a highly effective solution. However, with the range of potential solutions, it can be difficult to know where to begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a starting point, understanding the wide variety of marketing tasks that can be outsourced can be beneficial. Advisors might consider outsourcing roles such as social media management, search engine optimization, web development, event management, and performance analytics, among other options. Reviewing both current marketing efforts and aspirational goals for client engagement can help advisors determine where outsourcing may add the most value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom there, advisors may need to consider whom to outsource to. Quick tasks may only need a temporary contractor from platforms like Fiverr or Upwork. However, more complex needs, such as strategy and brand development, may benefit from someone with industry expertise to ensure deeper understanding with fewer revisions required. Advisors may also want to consider a contractor\u0026#39;s communication style and marketing philosophy to assess compatibility with the firm\u0026#39;s values.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce a contractor or firm has been hired, advisors can help set the stage for success by identifying key stakeholders and agreeing on clear definitions of success. Providing examples of effective marketing, existing guidelines, and a timeline for deliverables can establish a strong foundation. And, once work progresses, keeping an open line of communication – through email and video calls – can support feedback exchanges that help contractors align with the firm\u0026#39;s style and voice over time. Over the long term, success can be evaluated not only by long-term campaign results but also by cultural fit and the strategic insights the marketing partner brings to the firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, the key point is that partnering with a skilled contractor or agency can be a win-win for both the advisor and the contractor. By freeing advisors to focus on client service and core business functions, contractors can apply their specialized expertise, often leading to more effective marketing outcomes than an advisor could achieve alone. This collaboration not only enhances the firm\u0026#39;s marketing efforts but also allows the advisor to allocate time and energy where it\u0026#39;s most impactful, driving growth and fostering stronger client relationships. And with the right fit, an outsourced partner\u0026#39;s insights can help elevate the firm\u0026#39;s brand, positioning it more effectively in a competitive market and supporting long-term success!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Headshot-for-Lauren-1-200x200.png\" alt=\"Lauren Hong Headshot\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Headshot-for-Lauren-1-200x200.png 200w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Headshot-for-Lauren-1-300x300.png 300w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Headshot-for-Lauren-1-150x150.png 150w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Headshot-for-Lauren-1-768x766.png 768w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Headshot-for-Lauren-1-400x400.png 400w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Headshot-for-Lauren-1-800x800.png 800w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Headshot-for-Lauren-1.png 826w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-src=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Headshot-for-Lauren-1-200x200.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Headshot-for-Lauren-1-200x200.png 200w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Headshot-for-Lauren-1-300x300.png 300w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Headshot-for-Lauren-1-150x150.png 150w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Headshot-for-Lauren-1-768x766.png 768w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Headshot-for-Lauren-1-400x400.png 400w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Headshot-for-Lauren-1-800x800.png 800w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Headshot-for-Lauren-1.png 826w\" data-old-src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"lauren-hong\"\u003eLauren Hong\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuest Contributor\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren Hong is the President of Out \u0026amp; About Communications, an integrated marketing agency based in San Diego, California.

Clarifying the consultant\u0026#39;s involvement at every phase of engagement compared to other resources they may use is also essential. Some consultants may pinpoint opportunities for improvement but refer or bring in specialists to implement the changes, such as those who handle website design or marketing collateral updates.

The ongoing process should be evaluated and measured to ensure the firm\u0026#39;s goals and needs are being met. To build a productive and successful partnership, it\u0026#39;s important to define clear success criteria and establish Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) both at the outset and along the way, measuring how effective the provider is over time and making adjustments as needed to stay on track toward long-term goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuccess Metrics.\u003c/strong\u003e Defining what success means will be different for every firm. While it\u0026#39;s tempting to want to try and achieve every metric during an engagement, narrowing down to what matters most is typically more effective. For instance, a firm may focus on generating more leads or increasing revenue by targeting a higher-end market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoals should be refined with an understanding that some metrics may be stepping stones to broader objectives. For example, driving more website traffic to a specific landing page may lead to an increase in qualified leads. Similarly, tracking ad campaigns could highlight not just the volume of leads but the conversion rate to clients as well. Media features and requests for speaking engagements could also signal success and growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePriority Alignment.\u003c/strong\u003e At the start of a new engagement, firms often have many ideas ready to launch. But to make the most of the partnership, it\u0026#39;s important to set clear expectations around timeline and execution – whether for content creation, website updates, or other initiatives – so that project timeframes align with the firm\u0026#39;s needs. Regular weekly or monthly check-ins can help ensure that projects stay on track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s also helpful to break down the firm\u0026#39;s objectives into short- and long-term goals. Short-term goals might focus on what the firm wants to achieve in the first 3 to 6 months, such as developing a social media strategy. By contrast, long-term goals – such as scaling, rebranding, and enhancing client development – should be planned over a broader, year-long timeframe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTimeline For Impact.\u003c/strong\u003e Success doesn\u0026#39;t typically occur overnight, so it\u0026#39;s important to set realistic expectations for when the firm expects to see measurable results. Some marketing strategies require more time than others, with factors such as seasonality, trends, or unforeseen events also impacting progress. For instance, it can take \u003ca href=\"https://info.advisorstream.com/financial-advisor-marketing-trends-report-2024#:~:text=Three%20in%2010%20advisors%20spend,hour%20a%20week%20on%20marketing.\u0026amp;text=30%25%20of%20solo%20advisors%20use,majority%20are%20doing%20it%20themselves.\u0026amp;text=Having%20a%20defined%20marketing%20strategy,in%2010%20advisors%20have%20one.\"\u003emonths for a prospect to become a client\u003c/a\u003e, and about 3 to 6 months – or longer – to \u003ca href=\"https://www.webfx.com/seo/learn/how-long-does-it-take-to-see-seo-results/#:~:text=SEO%20takes%20between%20three%20and,improvements%20in%20rankings%20and%20traffic.\"\u003esee significant changes in strategies like SEO search rankings\u003c/a\u003e and social media engagement. While it\u0026#39;s possible to see early results, staying patient, monitoring performance, and adjusting approaches based on data and insights are key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like onboarding a new employee, bringing in a marketing agency or consultant is a time investment. Results may not be immediate, as they may need a few months to gain access to the firm\u0026#39;s systems and become familiar with the brand, processes, and communication style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCultural Fit.\u003c/strong\u003e A lot of a provider\u0026#39;s success comes down to how well they align with the firm. The right fit can create a natural rhythm where the firm isn\u0026#39;t overwhelmed or underwhelmed but moves steadily toward its goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, a partnership can feel strained if there are unclear expectations, missed deadlines, or poor communication. It\u0026#39;s important to assess how well the partner integrates with the team and aligns with the firm\u0026#39;s culture. Are they proactive, open to feedback, and collaborative? Gathering team input about how well the provider gets along with people can also provide valuable insights. Strong rapport and a positive attitude can go a long way in building a successful partnership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 data-nav-title=\"When To Reassess Providers\" id=\"when-to-reassess-providers-or-change-marketing-approaches\"\u003eWhen To Reassess Providers Or Change Marketing Approaches\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding the firm\u0026#39;s success criteria can also help identify when it may be time to reassess the current marketing partner, select a new provider, or choose a different approach – such as upgrading to a full-service agency. Recognizing the following potential warning signs early on can help the firm pivot before losing too many resources or momentum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne key indicator is stagnant or declining results. If there hasn\u0026#39;t been significant progress on the key metrics defined by the team, it could be a sign that the current approach isn\u0026#39;t delivering as expected. This might be a good time to have a conversation about the results and consider exploring other options. Another red flag is quality issues, such as consistently late deliverables or inconsistent outputs. If the new partner, whether it\u0026#39;s a freelancer or solo expert, struggles to keep up, it may signal that they need more capacity or support to meet the firm\u0026#39;s expectations and deliver reliable work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe firm may also outgrow its current provider if it experiences an inability to scale or notices any gaps in skills. As marketing needs become more complex, relying on providers like freelancers or off-the-shelf solutions might no longer provide the depth of expertise or resources required. As the firm grows, another important factor to consider is rapid expansion. If the firm is scaling quickly, transitioning from an outsourced marketing partner to an in-house team may make sense for more dedicated, full-time support. The firm may also need to reassess its goals if its priorities shift from task volume to more in-depth strategy refinement and brand positioning. Conversely, if the firm\u0026#39;s priority is getting more done with a set budget but its evolving needs require greater market differentiation, this may also indicate the need for a new partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lack of creativity or strategic insight can also be a reason to reevaluate the partnership. Sometimes, the firm may need a more involved partner who has deeper industry knowledge and can offer fresh ideas and perspectives. This is also important when the firm begins to move upmarket and wishes to truly stand out. Differentiation needs become a priority, and a more strategic, impactful approach may be required to refine the firm\u0026#39;s brand and messaging rather than relying on templated content and quick task services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, poor communication or a mismatch in culture, values, or working style can derail productivity and collaboration.
