Or #HotGirlWalks, where women film themselves power-walking in cute athleisure while listening to affirmations or self-help podcasts. On the surface, it all seems empowering, even wholesome. Who doesn’t want to feel polished and mentally strong?But dig a little deeper, and some people are starting to ask: are these trends really about health and self-care, or just another way to sell us the same old diet culture in a fresh, Instagrammable package? Because, for all their aspirational vibes, the “clean” girl and “hot” girl aesthetics still center a specific kind of body, discipline, and lifestyle. So the question isn’t just what these trends look like, but what they really mean.The Wellness Glow-Up…or Another Disguise?Wellness culture has become the new face of what used to be called dieting. Instead of low-fat yogurt and calorie-counting, we get matcha lattes, intuitive movement, and “gut health.” It feels more inclusive. It sounds more mindful. But the core message often hasn’t changed: smaller, prettier, more controlled.The “Clean Girl” aesthetic is often described as natural, effortless beauty. But what’s rarely said out loud is how much effort (and money) it actually takes. Serums, skincare tools, specific outfits, and the kind of facial symmetry that’s often praised only when it aligns with white, thin beauty standards. It’s less about being “clean” in any literal sense and more about appearing polished, calm, and, let’s be honest, socially acceptable.Then there’s the “Hot Girl Walk,” which positions movement as a mental health tool. That’s great in theory. But like many wellness trends, it quickly morphs into another aesthetic: toned legs, daily progress updates, and subtle pressure to perform “health” for an online audience. Suddenly, it’s not just about feeling good. It’s about looking good while doing it.If It’s About Health, Why Does It Look So Homogeneous?One of the most telling signs that something’s rooted in diet culture? It excludes. Not intentionally, maybe, but consistently. The women praised as “clean” or “hot” in these trends often look remarkably similar: thin, white or light-skinned, conventionally attractive, able-bodied, and financially comfortable.Where are the girls with acne, messy hair, visible disabilities, or full-time jobs that don’t allow for slow morning routines and aesthetic walks at golden hour? Where are the people who live in bodies that don’t fit the mold and never will?Wellness that only looks a certain way isn’t wellness. It’s branding. And like any branding rooted in body image, it comes with a side of shame for those who don’t, or can’t, buy in.Image by Daniel RecheEmpowerment…or Control?There’s nothing inherently wrong with wanting to feel good in your body. Movement can be healing. Skincare can be fun. Rituals can offer structure in a chaotic world. But when trends start policing what “good” looks like, they start feeling less empowering and more like old rules in new clothes.Clean eating became intuitive eating, which became gut healing. Workout plans became “joyful movement.” Thinness became “toned.” The language shifts, but the obsession with control, optimization, and visual perfection often remains.It’s the same internalized pressure, just rebranded in soft lighting and TikTok voiceovers. And if you’re constantly wondering whether you’re doing it “right,” if you feel like you need to buy more, eat less, or perform better, then maybe it’s not about wellness at all.The Trouble with Aesthetic WellnessAesthetic-based wellness makes people feel like health is something you can see. But real well-being is often invisible. It’s messy. It doesn’t always look like clear skin, matching sets, or a curated playlist. And it’s different for everyone.When we tie our self-worth to how we appear—whether we call it “hot,” “clean,” or “well”—we risk reducing complex experiences into marketable checklists. And that’s when empowerment becomes performance. What’s especially frustrating is how these trends often claim to be “for everyone,” when clearly, they’re not. They create a hierarchy of what’s considered healthy, desirable, or disciplined, and shame creeps in for those who can’t or don’t conform.Can We Reclaim These Trends?Not all is lost. You can enjoy a hot girl walk without buying into perfectionism. You can love skincare without subscribing to Eurocentric beauty ideals. The key is awareness—knowing where the messaging crosses the line from support to shame.Ask yourself: Is this making me feel better in my body, or worse? Am I doing this because I love myself, or because I’m trying to fix myself? Would I still do this if no one else saw it?When the answer is rooted in self-kindness, joy, or genuine care, you’re probably on the right path. But if it’s about performance, control, or fitting into someone else’s aesthetic, you have every right to push back.Do you think trends like “clean girl” and “hot girl walks” are helpful forms of self-care, or just another version of diet culture in disguise?Read More:5 Ways To Save on Groceries With Dietary RestrictionsSkipping Breakfast Might Be Saving Your Wallet But Hurting Your BrainRiley is an Arizona native with over nine years of writing experience.
