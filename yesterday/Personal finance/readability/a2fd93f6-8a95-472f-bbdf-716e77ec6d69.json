Best Apps That Pay Real Money Instantly Here are my quick picks of the best apps that pay real money instantly without paying: Freecash Swagbucks KashKick Rakuten Survey Junkie Fetch Rewards Branded Surveys Upside Below is the full list of the best apps that pay real money instantly. Proof that I made money on the Freecash app. The $0.05 amounts were rewards for playing 2 minutes each day. The larger amounts like $40, $70, and $150 were for reaching certain levels. 1. Freecash I personally use Freecash, and it’s one of the easiest ways I’ve found to earn a little extra cash with an app platform. Whether I’m playing games or answering surveys, the tasks are easy and fast to do. The best part? I’ve cashed out my points multiple times with no hassle, which is always a plus for me! I also recently made $302 by playing games on my phone in just one week on Freecash. Freecash is a website where you can earn money by doing simple tasks. You can play games (they have a wide variety of games to play like Bubble Cash, Blackout Bingo, Wheel of Fortune, Mahjong, and more!), try new apps, answer surveys, and even win cash prizes to get rewards.

I shop online a lot, so getting money back on things I was already going to buy feels like a win. I especially love the quarterly PayPal payments that show up like a little bonus every few months. I recently bought a kayak online and got $90 cash back, so that is a nice chunk of change! Rakuten is an app that gives you money back when you shop online. It’s easy to use and works with lots of stores (there are over 2,500 retailers you can get cash back at) you probably already buy from such as Old Navy, Target, PetSmart, Macy’s, and more.

Survey Junkie is a popular app that pays you for sharing your opinions. It’s easy to use and has over 20 million members. You can make between 50 cents and $5 per survey.

Fetch Rewards I use Fetch Rewards every time I go grocery shopping! Taking pictures of receipts takes just seconds, and I love how the points add up. It feels like a small reward for everyday shopping, and I’ve redeemed my points for gift cards to places like Target and Amazon. You can scan receipts from lots of places. Grocery stores, clothing stores, restaurants, and gas stations all work. Even online purchases count if you link your accounts. Every receipt gets you at least 25 points. Some products give you bonus points. You don’t have to pick offers ahead of time or scan barcodes. You can just shop like normal and snap a picture afterward.

Ibotta Ibotta is one of those apps I always recommend to friends because it’s such a no-brainer for grocery shopping. I just add offers before I head to the store and upload my receipt afterward. It’s similar to Fetch Rewards, but it does typically give you more in points because you have to choose your offers BEFORE you go shopping. For example, you may get (offers are constantly changing, so you will want to download the app yourself to see the current rates): $0.35 back for grapes $0.10 back for laundry detergent $3.00 back on diapers $2.00 back on pasta sauce $5.00 back on bodywash And more.
