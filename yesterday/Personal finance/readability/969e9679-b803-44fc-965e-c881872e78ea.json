  "text": "Source: The College InvestorPharmacy school is expensive and there are special student loans for pharmacy school that can help pay for it. And there's also the potential for loan forgiveness for pharmacists as well!According to the American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education, the average student loan debt of graduating pharmacist is $123,063. And depending on where you practice, your entry level pharmacist salary may only be around $100,000 per year.As such, you need to know the options for how to pay for pharmacy school in the most effective way possible. It can sound daunting to take out $123,000 in student loans, but it is possible to make this a positive return on investment.If you already know most of your options and are simply looking to find the best private student loans, check out Credible and compare your options in 2 minutes. Try Credible here. You might also look at LendKey directly - as they have some of the lowest student loan rates.The Order Of Operations To Pay For Pharmacy SchoolThere is a smart order of operations to pay for pharmacy school. We'll talk about each a little more in-depth below, but in general, you should follow this order if you can.Honestly, this order of operations applies for paying for college in general as well.Your Own SavingsScholarships and GrantsDirect Subsidized or Unsubsidized LoansDirect PLUS Graduate LoansPrivate Student LoansOf course, there are always variations on a theme, but in general, this is the order you should follow when paying for pharmacy school and getting student loans for your pharmacy degree.Your Own SavingsThe first place to start is your own savings. I know this won't get you far, but if you've worked in high school or during undergrad, you might have a nice bit of money saved up that can help offset the costs of pharmacy school. It's important to note that you shouldn't be depleting your savings to pay for school. It's important that you keep an emergency fund to cover your expenses should something happen. I've seen too many issues where a car accident or some other unexpected event puts you out of commission for months. That's why having an emergency fund is so important - even for students.Scholarships And GrantsAfter your own savings, you should see if you can qualify for any scholarships and grants. There are a large number of scholarships that are directed towards pharmacy students, but don't ignore other scholarship and grant opportunities as well.Using grants to pay for college is a great (and underutilized) opportunity to save money on the cost of going to school.And there are other scholarships that you might qualify for. We have our Side Hustlin' Student Scholarship that is geared towards entrepreneurial college students. The bottom line is that you should look outside the box when applying for scholarships.Related: Find Scholarships and Grants In Your StateDirect Student LoansAfter you've exhausted your own money (between savings, working, and scholarships), it's time to consider student loans.When looking at student loans, you should always start with Federal loans. The Direct Loan Program offers unsubsidized loans to graduate students, including pharmacy students. Graduate students can borrow up to $20,500 per year. You can find the interest rates of student loans here.Note: These loans are eligible for loan forgiveness under programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness.Direct PLUS Graduate Student LoansAfter you've taken advantage of the Direct Loans up to their maximum, it's time to look at Direct PLUS Graduate Student Loans.These loans can be take out to cover the maximum cost of attendance (according to your schools' financial aid office), minus any other financial aid received. For most pharmacy students taking out student loans, Direct PLUS Loans can make up the difference of what's needed to pay for college. A Direct PLUS Loan does require a credit check, so if you have a poor credit history, you may need a cosigner to help you with the student loan.Direct PLUS Loans have some of the highest interest rates for Federal loans, so it's important to consider that when borrowing. If you have excellent credit, you might want to consider other options now or later.Note: These loans are eligible for loan forgiveness under programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness.HRSA Health Professional Student LoanWe didn't include this loan in our chart for how to pay for pharmacy school, but it's important to note it's existence for the right borrowers.  The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) provides low cost loans to pharmacy students who meet certain criteria.This program provide long-term, low-interest rate loans to full-time, needy students to pursue a degree in pharmacy.It might not be the right choice for everyone, but it's definitely an option for some. You can learn more about the HRSA Loan Program here.Private Student LoansSome pharmacy students cannot solely rely on Federal loans to pay for pharmacy school. Either they exhaust Federal loan limits due to their school’s cost, they need more funds to cover living expenses while attending school, or they need more time to complete their education (which increases cost). Others may find more value in taking on private loans given their excellent credit and ability to repay. In this case, private student loans may be a cheaper alternative due to low interest rates and excellent borrower programs.We recommend borrowers shop and compare their private student loan options on Credible. We love Credible for a few reasons. They allow you to see your options in minutes. The compare most of the major lenders. And they make the process of getting a private loan super easy. Credible also has some of our favorite pharmacy school lenders on their platform, such as Splash Financial.Check out Credible here for your private student loan needs.Refinancing Student Loans After GraduationIf you're finding this article after you've already taken out loans for pharmacy school, you might consider student loan refinancing.If you have private loans or high-interest Federal Loans (like the Direct PLUS Loans mentioned above), refinancing might allow you to lower your payment or save on interest on your pharmacy school loans. Through refinancing, you take out a new student loan from a private lender and use it pay off your other loans. With the new student loan, you may qualify for a lower interest rate, better repayment term, or lower monthly payment.If you have Federal student loans, refinancing will cost you the ability to apply for an income-driven repayment plan or forbearance. It might also cost you the opportunity for loan forgiveness. That's why, for many borrowers, we don't think you should refinance your Federal student loan for a private student loan.However, pharmacists are one of the exceptions to the rule. Pharmacists will make a significant amount of money once they start in practice. For many, this means they would benefit more from getting a student loan with a low interest rate, versus keeping a Federal student loan.For example, Direct PLUS Graduate loans currently have an interest rate of 9.08%. But you can refinance with Credible you could potentially save on interest!See if Credible makes sense to refinance. You can shop loans in 2 minutes. As a bonus to College Investor readers, you'll get up to a $1,000 gift card bonus when you refinance with Credible. See terms. Check out Credible today.Final ThoughtsWhile the thought of borrowing so much money to pay for school can be exhausting, remember the prize at the end of the tunnel. You'll be earning a significant amount of money after graduation, and you'll be able to afford your student loan payments.The math on student loans for pharmacy students is relative. While a teacher may borrow $40,000, they will only expect to earn $40,000 per year after graduation. A pharmacist, on the other hand, will earn anywhere from $100,000 to $140,000 after they are in practice. That makes the student loan amount relative.A good tip I always like to share with pharmacists as well - live like a college student for your first few years after graduation. You've delayed gratification for years, just add a couple more. You can use those first few years of high income to eliminate your student loan debt, and you'll set yourself up for a bright financial future.",
