  "text": "Image by Ketut SubiyantoEarning a college degree, especially one that took years of studying, thousands of dollars in tuition, and possibly some soul-searching is supposed to open doors, not lead you into a job you could’ve gotten without even finishing high school. But with the job market being what it is, it’s easy to feel desperate.Still, some roles can actually hold you back, making your degree seem irrelevant or causing potential employers to question your career trajectory down the road. These jobs may be tempting in the short term, but they often offer low pay, little room for growth, and minimal connection to your long-term goals.Here are nine jobs that most people with a degree should think twice about applying for—unless it’s absolutely necessary.1. Retail Sales AssociateRetail jobs are often flexible and easy to get, but they rarely require or reward a college degree. Even if you’re looking for quick income, long-term advancement is slow, and many roles cap out at management with limited salary increases. Hiring managers may also wonder why someone with a degree is working retail and assume you’re not committed to your field.2. Food Service WorkerThere’s no shame in honest work, but spending your post-grad years behind a counter or waiting tables is rarely a strategic career move. These roles are physically demanding, emotionally draining, and come with unpredictable schedules and modest pay. If you studied communications, business, or STEM, this line of work doesn’t help build your resume.3. Entry-Level Call Center AgentSome call centers hire aggressively and pay decently, but the work often involves scripts, quotas, and high burnout. It’s also difficult to translate call center experience into most degree-relevant positions. Unless you’re aiming for a career in customer success or call center management, this path usually isn’t aligned with your education.4. Rideshare Driver or Delivery WorkerDriving for apps like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, or Instacart may seem like an easy way to earn cash, especially if you’re between jobs. But this kind of gig work doesn’t offer benefits, security, or upward mobility. Over time, it can feel like you’re treading water, and that degree on your resume might start to collect dust.5. Receptionist at a Non-Specialized OfficeBeing a receptionist might offer some stability, but many of these roles require minimal qualifications and don’t offer much career growth unless they’re tied to specific industries like law or medicine. With a degree, you’re likely overqualified and underpaid—plus, it can be hard to pivot into more strategic roles later.Image by Tiger Lily6. Seasonal or Temporary Labor JobsJobs like warehouse pickers, stockroom workers, and other seasonal gigs may be necessary to make ends meet short-term, but they won’t enhance your professional profile. Employers may wonder why you haven’t pursued opportunities that match your qualifications. If you must take one, be sure to keep your long-term goals in focus and continue networking or applying for roles in your field.7. TelemarketingTelemarketing roles often rely on cold calls, high-pressure sales tactics, and scripts. These jobs don’t typically require a degree and can come off as a red flag to future employers, particularly if they’re not related to marketing or sales strategy. It’s a tough sell—pun intended—for someone trying to build a professional brand.8. Nanny or Babysitter (Unless It’s Your Career Path)Childcare is incredibly valuable, but unless you’re pursuing a career in early childhood education or development, working as a full-time nanny might make your degree appear underutilized. It can also be tough to translate caregiving into transferable skills for more traditional office roles, unless framed carefully on your resume.9. Hotel Front Desk ClerkThis role may sound appealing with the promise of travel perks or a relaxed atmosphere, but the responsibilities are generally routine, the pay is modest, and the growth opportunities are limited. If you studied hospitality management or tourism, it might make sense, but for most other degrees, it’s not a forward step.Choose Jobs That Reflect Your WorthIt’s understandable to take whatever work you can find when money’s tight or the job market is sluggish. But if you have a college degree, it’s important to aim for roles that either build your resume, utilize your education, or at least move you toward a larger goal.You don’t need to land your dream job straight out of college, but you do deserve more than a role that ignores everything you’ve worked for. Try focusing on internships, entry-level roles in your field, or even part-time positions that align with your skill set.Do you think taking an “off-path” job after graduation helps or hurts in the long run? Have you ever accepted a job you felt overqualified for?Read More:How Can You Boost Your Chances of Landing a New Job?5 Mistakes You’re Making in Your Job Search (And How to Fix Them)Riley is an Arizona native with over nine years of writing experience.
