  "text": "A pre-purchase inspection is a comprehensive evaluation done by a qualified mechanic to assess the condition of a used car before you buy it.

Additionally, CarsDirect partners with numerous dealers to offer streamlined purchase options for both new and used cars, simplifying the buying process.Why is a pre-purchase inspection important?A pre-purchase inspection (PPI) is an essential step in the used-car-buying process, and it offers four main benefits.Provides peace of mind. Knowing the exact condition of a used car helps you make an informed decision. It reduces the likelihood of buying a car that leaves you stranded or has major repair bills down the road.Ensures safety. A PPI includes checking that all safety features are functioning correctly, so you can have greater assurance that you, your passengers and other drivers are protected.Helps with negotiation. If a mechanic discovers issues during a pre-purchase inspection, it can help you to negotiate a lower car price or request repairs before you buy.What does a pre-purchase car inspection include?Usually a standard pre-purchase inspection involves the following, but details can vary depending on the provider.‚òê Exterior inspection. Checks for signs of accidents, flood damage, rust or paint inconsistencies. Includes aspects like tire condition, underbody damage and window cracks.‚òê Interior inspection. Assesses the condition of upholstery, mats, the headliner (ceiling) and seat belts. Includes inside lights, air conditioning, gauges, infotainment and other electrical items.‚òê Mechanical evaluation. Examines the engine, transmission, brakes, steering, suspension and exhaust systems for wear or damage. Includes checking for leaks and missing parts.¬†‚òê Diagnostic testing. Uses specialized tools to detect error codes or issues within the vehicle's computer systems.‚òê Test drive. Evaluates the car's performance, including acceleration, braking and handling.‚òê EV inspections. Includes assessing battery health and whether degradation is normal for the car‚Äôs age.¬†Where to get a pre-purchase inspectionWhen deciding where to take a car for a pre-purchase inspection, it‚Äôs important to choose the provider yourself. For example, if you‚Äôre buying a car from a private seller, don‚Äôt rely on a pre-purchase inspection report they provide. These people and places typically offer pre-purchase inspections.Local mechanics. You may already have a relationship with a trusted mechanic who will provide an unbiased assessment. This could be someone who works independently or for a body shop.Specialized technicians. For specific makes or models, a technician familiar with that brand can provide more detailed insights. Mobile inspection services. These services come to the vehicle's location, offering convenience, especially for private sales. This is also a good option if you‚Äôre buying a car in another state.Dealerships. Some dealerships offer PPIs, but it's not recommended to have the inspection done at the same dealership where you‚Äôre buying the car. If you‚Äôre buying from a used car lot, you might get an inspection at the service center of the new car dealership for that brand.National retailer. Some chains, such as tire and oil change businesses, provide car inspections at a lower cost.ü§ìNerdy TipIf the car is a certified pre-owned (CPO) vehicle, factory-trained mechanics have already inspected it as a requirement for manufacturer certification. CPO cars are also sold with a warranty. A third-party, pre-purchase inspection may not be as critical for a CPO vehicle, but you can still get one if you want the added reassurance.How much does a pre-purchase inspection cost?The typical cost of a pre-purchase inspection is about $100 to $300. Prices vary based on where you live, the depth of the inspection and where it‚Äôs done. Even though this is an added expense, it can prevent you from buying a damaged car and save you from costly repairs in the future.Members of AAA and Auto Club may have access to discounts on pre-purchase inspections.When to schedule a pre-purchase inspectionThe best time to arrange a PPI is after you‚Äôve narrowed down your vehicle choices but before you finalize a purchase. This timing ensures that any issues discovered can influence your decision-making process or negotiation strategy. Taking a car for an inspection when you test drive it can save you time.Frequently asked questionsWhat if the seller refuses a pre-purchase inspection?If a seller won‚Äôt agree to a third-party inspection, it could be a red flag. A refusal could mean they‚Äôre hiding issues, so it may be best to move on to other vehicles.Is a vehicle history report the same as a pre-purchase inspection?No, a vehicle history report is helpful but not a substitute for a hands-on inspection. It shows past events, but only an inspection can reveal current mechanical issues.How do I get a pre-purchase inspection if I buy out-of-state or online?You can hire a local mechanic or mobile inspection service near the seller‚Äôs location. Many services will go to the car, perform the inspection and send you a detailed report.Also, some online retailers like Carvana and Carmax allow you to return a vehicle within a certain time period. If that‚Äôs the case for a car you buy online, make sure to get an inspection before the return window expires.Do I also have to pay to take the car for a third-party inspection?To ensure you do not take off with the car, some sellers may ask for a refundable deposit. Dealerships might also ask you to sign a nonbinding purchase agreement.",
