Learn what I think of this site in my NiceSurveys Review. Want to make some extra money at home? If you’re like me, you probably like finding simple ways to make extra money in your free time. I have personally tried many online paid survey sites – some that paid well and others that were a waste of my time. Today, I want to share my honest experience testing NiceSurveys, a survey site that says you can earn cash or gift cards just for sharing your opinions online. In this NiceSurveys review, I go over how this survey site works, how much money you can actually expect to make, my real-life pros and cons, and whether or not it’s worth your time. You can click here to start answering surveys on NiceSurveys. NiceSurveys Review Below is my NiceSurveys review. Here is a screenshot of some of the surveys available in my NiceSurveys account. What is NiceSurveys? NiceSurveys is a new online survey platform that’s available as a website and an app (Android). You can sign up if you live in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., or Australia. The idea is simple: You answer questions, share your honest thoughts about products and services, and earn a little money in return. When you join NiceSurveys, you’ll get access to surveys that can pay anywhere from just a few cents to a couple of dollars each. Some surveys take just 7 or 10 minutes, while others can be closer to 30 minutes. Once you reach the payout minimum of $1 to $5, you can cash out through PayPal, Venmo, or a long list of gift cards like Amazon – there are over 150 gift card options available. I really like that they give you so many ways to cash out. Not every survey site has this many choices, especially with a low payout minimum. Is NiceSurveys legit? Whenever I test a new survey site, the first thing I look for is whether it’s actually legit. I never want you wasting your time on scams or sites that never pay out. I can say that NiceSurveys is real – I tested it myself and I saw actual surveys waiting for me every time I logged in. I earned a $5 Amazon gift card and received it pretty quickly. The first payout took about 24 hours so they could verify my account, but I’ve heard that after that, future payouts only take a few minutes. I also didn’t get disqualified very often, which made the experience feel better than some other survey sites I’ve used. NiceSurveys has a 4.3 out of 5 star rating on Google Play, with over 10,000 downloads. NiceSurveys also has a Trustpilot rating of 4.7 out of 5 stars, with over 300 reviews. NiceSurveys gift card options How does NiceSurveys work? If you’re new to survey sites, here’s how NiceSurveys works, step-by-step: Sign up for free – You can sign up on their website or download the Android app. It’s free and only takes a few minutes. Complete your profile – You’ll answer questions about yourself, like your age, job, household details (such as if you have any kids), and more. This helps NiceSurveys match you with surveys you’re more likely to qualify for. Pick your surveys – Once your profile is ready, you’ll see surveys waiting on your dashboard. Each survey shows how much it pays, how long it should take, and a star rating from other users. I love that you can see these ratings upfront because it helps you decide which ones are worth your time. Answer the survey – Click a survey, answer honestly, and finish. I found that I didn’t get screened out too much, which is a nice change from other sites that screen you out constantly. Cash out – Once you reach the payout minimum (as low as $1 for an Amazon gift card), you can choose PayPal, Venmo, or pick from more than 150 gift cards. One feature I like is the Welcome Bonus Streak. If you complete a survey daily for 30 days, you can earn little bonuses along the way. You can even miss up to 5 days and still get the full streak bonus. It’s not a huge amount, but it’s an easy way to add a few extra dollars to your balance. Here is my NiceSurveys payout proof. How much can you make with NiceSurveys? You’re not going to get rich with online surveys, but it can be an easy way to earn some extra pocket money while watching TV or waiting around. When I tested NiceSurveys, I saw surveys that paid anywhere from 38 cents for a 7-minute survey up to around $1.86 for longer ones that took 15–25 minutes. Most surveys were in the 50 cents to $1.50 range. The time estimates were mostly accurate, but like all survey sites, some surveys may run longer than expected. I liked that my first $5 payout came through in about 24 hours. After that, I read in other NiceSurveys reviews that future payments would be more instant. The low payout minimum is a big plus for me – I don’t like sites that make you wait to cash out. Here’s an example of a survey that I was kicked out of. My personal experience using NiceSurveys Here’s my personal experience using NiceSurveys: Not many disqualifications: I wasn’t kicked out of many surveys – this can always be super annoying when you spend time answering questions, but then you’re kicked out before you earn any money. Payout proof: I earned a $5 Amazon gift card and received it quickly. The first one took about a day to process, but future ones should be faster. Lots of payout choices: I love that they have PayPal, Venmo, Amazon, and so many other gift cards. Low pay for some surveys: Like all survey sites, some surveys do pay less than you’d hope for the time they take. It’s important to look at the time estimate and payout so you know what to expect. Overall, NiceSurveys is legit and easy to use, but you do have to go in with realistic expectations. It’s best for a little extra money on the side, not for a full-time paycheck. Pros and cons of NiceSurveys Here’s what I think are the pros and cons of NiceSurveys: Pros: Very easy to sign up and use Free to join, no hidden fees Lower disqualification rate than some sites Welcome bonus streak Low payout minimum (starting at $1) Lots of payout options like PayPal, Venmo, Amazon, and more Works on both desktop and mobile Cons: First payout takes about 24 hours for verification Like all survey sites, you may still get screened out sometimes Tips for making the most with NiceSurveys If you decide to try NiceSurveys, here are a few of my tips: Be honest when filling out your profile so you get surveys that actually match you. Look at the star ratings – pick the higher-rated surveys because they’re usually easier. If you want to not feel frustrated, then I recommend starting out by answering shorter surveys to lower your chances of getting screened out. Use the daily bonus streak to earn a little extra. Cash out as soon as you hit the minimum payout – don’t wait! Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about NiceSurveys. Is NiceSurveys worth it? If you want an easy way to make a little extra money in your spare time, NiceSurveys can be worth adding to your list. Just don’t expect huge payouts – think of it as coffee or some free gift cards. How does NiceSurveys pay you? You can choose PayPal cash, Venmo, bank transfer, or over 150 different gift cards like Amazon, Walmart, Apple, Kroger, Target, Instacart, Old Navy, and more. What’s the minimum payout? Some rewards start at around $1, and others start at $5. Why do I get disqualified sometimes? It happens on every survey site. Keeping your profile up to date and sticking with shorter surveys can help. Can you really make money with NiceSurveys? Yes, but I definitely think that you should keep your expectations realistic – it’s just a small side gig for a little extra cash. This is not a full-time income, and you will not make hundreds of dollars a month from this one site. NiceSurveys Review – Summary I hope you enjoyed my NiceSurveys review. If you like taking surveys in your spare time, it can be an easy way to earn a few extra dollars for small treats or fun extras. I like that NiceSurveys has lots of payout options and fewer disqualifications than other sites I’ve tried. Overall, my experience was positive.
