Jobs… Are you looking for the best jobs that pay $100,000 a year? Many people dream of making a six-figure salary and making more money. A job that pays $100,000 or more can help you reach your financial goals. It can let you save for the future, pay off debts, or enjoy a comfortable lifestyle. Jobs that pay $100,000 or more many times need a college degree. But some high-paying jobs only need training. Best Jobs That Pay $100,000 a Year Below are the best jobs that pay $100,000 a year. Recommended reading: 26 High Paying Jobs With No Experience Required 1. Software developer Software developers are in high demand. They create computer programs and apps that we use every day. This job many times pays over $100,000 a year. You don’t always need a college degree to become a software developer. Many learn through coding boot camps or teach themselves. The most important thing is having strong programming skills. This job lets you be creative and solve problems, and you’ll usually work with a team of other developers. Many companies may allow you to work from home (I know a few software developers and they all work from home), and sometimes you may even have flexible hours. 2. Pharmacist Pharmacists give out medicines and help patients understand how to use them safely. They also check for drug interactions and answer questions about medications. To become a pharmacist, you’ll need to go to school, and you’ll need a degree called a doctor of pharmacy. It usually takes about 5 to 6 years after high school. The hard work pays off, though, as pharmacists make over $100,000. You can work in different places as a pharmacist. Many work in drugstores or grocery stores, and others work in hospitals or clinics. 3. Airline pilot Many pilots earn over $100,000 a year, especially those who work for major airlines. As a commercial pilot, you’ll fly passengers and cargo to destinations around the world. You’ll need special training and licenses to do this job. It takes hard work, but the pay can be great! New pilots usually start at smaller airlines and they may earn less money at first. But as you gain experience, you can move up to bigger airlines that pay more. Some experienced pilots at major airlines can make $200,000 or even $300,000 or more a year! The job comes with other perks too. You might get free or cheap flights for you and your family. Plus, you’ll get to travel and see new places as part of your work. 4. Blogger Blogging is what I do, and I make well over $100,000 per year. There have even been many months where I have earned over $100,000 in a single month. As a blogger, you can write about topics you’re passionate about, whether it’s personal finance, travel, cooking, lifestyle, or something else, while also helping others by sharing useful information. Making a six-figure income as a blogger typically involves multiple income streams, such as affiliate marketing, sponsored content, ad revenue, and selling digital products or courses (I do all of these to make money on my blog). It takes time and effort to build an audience and establish trust with readers, but once your blog grows, the opportunities are pretty much endless. The best part is that you don’t need any specific degree to get started – just a willingness to learn, a knack for writing, and a strong work ethic. You’ll also enjoy flexibility in your schedule and the potential to work from anywhere. Many successful bloggers, including myself, have turned their blogs into full-time, money-making careers. You can learn more at How To Start A Blog FREE Course and join over 80,000 people who have already taken the course. Want to see how I built a $5,000,000 blog? In this free course, I show you how to create a blog, from the technical side to earning your first income and attracting readers. 5. Nurse practitioner Nurse practitioners are in high demand and earn great salaries. You can make over $100,000 a year in this role. To become a nurse practitioner, you’ll need extra schooling after becoming a registered nurse. You’ll need a master’s degree or doctoral nursing degree, as well as pass an exam. This career lets you care for patients and work in different settings. You might work in hospitals, clinics, or private offices. Some nurse practitioners even run their own practices (many states allow for this). 6. Marketing manager Marketing managers are in high demand because they help companies (such as in tech, retail, travel, and more) promote products and services to customers. This job can pay $100,000 or more per year. As a marketing manager, you’d create plans (such as a marketing campaign) to reach target audiences. You might use social media, ads, and other ways to spread the word about a company. They work with teams to come up with new ideas, and this could include making videos, writing content, or planning events. They also look at data to see what’s working and what’s not. 7. Art director Art directors can make good money while pursuing their love of art. They get to shape the look of projects. This could be for ads, magazines, movies, or TV shows, and they make big decisions about colors, styles, and layouts. The pay for art directors is great and many earn over $100,000 a year. To become an art director, you need a mix of skills. You should be good at art and design. But you also need leadership abilities, as art directors guide teams of artists and designers. Most art directors have a bachelor’s degree in art or design and many start in lower-level creative jobs first. They work their way up to director roles. 8. Physicians and surgeons Physicians are among the highest-paid professionals in the medical field. They diagnose and treat illnesses, injuries, and other health problems. To become a physician, you need to complete medical school and a residency program, and this takes many years of study and hard work. The average salary for physicians is well over $100,000 per year. Some specialists can earn much more, even over $500,000 or higher. As a physician, you can choose from many different specialties. These include family medicine, pediatrics, surgery, and more. Physicians usually work long hours, many times including nights and weekends. But many find the job very rewarding because they help people every day.

Copywriters create content for websites, ads, and more. Copywriters can make $100,000 or more per year. I personally know many copywriters who make a great income. Many companies need copywriters. You could work for big businesses, small shops, or even yourself. There are lots of options. To be a great copywriter, you need to be creative and you also need to understand what makes people want to buy things. You don’t always need a college degree to be a copywriter. But you do need to be a really good writer. 10. Real estate agent Real estate agents can make $100,000 a year or more. This job lets you help people buy and sell homes. You need a license to become an agent. Getting one takes some study and passing a test. Once you have it, you can start working with clients. Your pay depends on how many homes you sell. Most agents earn a percentage of each sale, so the more expensive the house, the more money you can make. 11.

They might create homes, offices, schools, or even entire cities. It’s a job that mixes art and science. As an architect, you’ll use your creativity to draw plans and make models.

Real estate entrepreneur Real estate entrepreneurs buy, sell, and manage properties to make money. They look for good deals on houses, apartments, commercial buildings, or land. You can start small with just one property. As you learn, you can grow your business and own more places. Real estate investors sometimes even fix up old buildings. They make them look nice so they can sell them for more money (this is called flipping). Some entrepreneurs rent out their properties. They become landlords and collect money from tenants each month.
