You can use your points for gift cards and cash. What Is Swagbucks? Swagbucks is a rewards website that pays you for doing simple tasks. You earn Swagbucks (SB) points for different activities on the site. Here are some ways to earn: Shop online through Swagbucks links Take surveys about products and services Watch short video clips Play games on the site Use the Swagbucks search engine It’s free to join and easy to use. Many people like Swagbucks because you can earn money in your spare time from your phone or your laptop. Once you have enough SB, you can trade them for rewards. 100 SB is usually worth $1. You can cash out your SB for PayPal money or gift cards to places like Amazon. Recommended reading: Swagbucks Review – How Much Can You Make On Swagbucks? 11 Swagbucks Hacks To Make Extra Money Below are 12 Swagbucks hacks to make more money on Swagbucks. Please click here to join Swagbucks through my referral link, and you can receive up to a $10 bonus. 1. Get a bonus for signing up Swagbucks gives a free sign up bonus for creating an account. For example, if you use my referral link, you can get a sign-up bonus for Swagbucks. This sign-up bonus is an easy way to kick-start your earnings. It’s free money, so why not take advantage of it? Note: The terms of the bonus will vary. Right now, here’s how the sign-up bonus on Swagbucks works: “Member must ‘Activate’ the Bonus in the Swag Ups section of your account. Bonus value is earned in the form of points, called SB. Get a 1000 SB bonus, which is equivalent to $10 in value, when you spend at least $25 at a store featured in Swagbucks.com/Shop. You must receive a minimum of 25 SB for this purchase, which you must complete within 30 days of registration.” 2. Log in daily to look for extra points Logging into Swagbucks every day can help you earn more points. The site has special offers and bonuses that change daily, and by logging in, you can take advantage of the different ways that you may be able to earn points. When you log in, check the homepage for new ways to earn. You might find surveys, videos, or games that give extra points. Swagbucks makes it easy with a “Daily Bonus” section that gives you a checklist of ways to earn points each day, such as by answering the daily poll, adding a magic receipts offer, a daily search, daily trivia, deal of the day, attempting a survey, and more. By making Swagbucks part of your daily routine, you can spot these chances to earn more. Even if you only have a few minutes, you can still grab some extra points and see if anything interests you. Now, you definitely will not get rich with these daily points, but if you’re looking for an easy way to earn points, then this may be an option for you. These are some of the surveys I see in my personal Swagbucks account. 3. Complete surveys Surveys are a great way to earn Swagbucks points. You can find lots of them on the site. But not all surveys are the same. Some give you more points than others. I recommend that you look for surveys that pay more SB points, as these are more likely to be worth your time. Check how long each survey takes and how many points it gives. Skip the ones that don’t pay much. For example, when I log in to Swagbucks, I see this: a 32-minute survey that pays 275 points a 35-minute survey that pays 150 points I see a lot more surveys than that, but the above shows you how different the surveys can pay for a similar amount of time. Try to pick surveys that give you the most points for your time. This way, you can earn more without spending all day on the site. It’s smart to focus on the best-paying surveys. Also, you may log in and see that some say “Guaranteed” next to the points amount. This means that you are guaranteed to qualify, so this may make it worth it to take the survey as well. While I answer survey questions on Swagbucks, there are times when I get rejected because I don’t fit the target demographic for that specific survey. It can be frustrating, but it’s part of the process, and there are always other surveys to try. So, finding “guaranteed” surveys can be nice because you know you won’t get rejected. Also, there are many other survey companies you can sign up for, such as Survey Junkie, American Consumer Opinion, Branded Surveys, and Prime Opinion.

It’s easy and can increase your earnings without much work. Right now, the bonus for inviting friends is that your referral earns 300 SB in their first month – you get a 300 SB Bonus, plus you also get 10% of all your referral’s earnings for the life of their account. To invite friends, you can share your referral link through email, text message, or social media. You can find this link in your Swagbucks account. You can invite as many friends as you want. The more people you bring in, the more you can earn. It’s a great way to grow your Swagbucks balance without doing extra tasks yourself. 5. Search with Swagbucks Swagbucks has its own search engine that can help you earn points. It’s powered by Bing (similar to Google Search), so you’ll get good results when you use it. To start earning, just make Swagbucks your default search engine. This way, you’ll use it without even thinking about it. Every time you search, you have a chance to win SB points. The amount you can earn varies, but it can add up over time. You don’t need to change how you use the internet. Just search like normal, and you might see a message saying you won some SB. Remember, don’t try to game the system by doing lots of fake searches. Swagbucks can tell, and it won’t work. Instead, use the search engine for your everyday needs. Look up recipes, check the weather, or find answers to questions. 6. Upload grocery receipts for points You can earn extra Swagbucks by scanning your grocery receipts. It’s an easy way to get points for things you’re buying anyway. Swagbucks has a feature that lets you scan and upload receipts from your shopping trips. You can do this with their mobile app or online on their website. You can submit receipts from Walmart, Kroger, Target, Walgreens, Costco, Aldi, City Market, Dollar Tree, The Home Depot, Publix, and so much more. The app reads your receipt and gives you SB points based on what you bought. Some items might have special offers that give you more points. For example, you get points for every receipt you submit (no matter the receipt), but you can also get points for buying a loaf of bread, bananas, eggs, and more. You might only get a few SB per receipt, but it adds up over time. Plus, it’s a quick task you can do while putting away groceries. This hack is great because it rewards you for shopping you’re already doing. It’s an easy way to boost your Swagbucks earnings without extra effort. Also, there are many more receipt-scanning apps that you can use, such as Fetch Rewards and Ibotta. I scan all of my grocery receipts on multiple apps (yes, you can typically use the same receipt on many apps and earn points for the same receipt), and I think it’s an easy way to get free gift cards. 7. Participate in daily polls Swagbucks has a quick and easy way to earn points every day, and one of the easiest Swagbucks offers is their daily polls. These polls are super simple. They ask one question about random topics, and you just pick an answer and get 1 SB point. It only takes a few seconds to do. You can make it part of your morning routine. Log in, answer the poll, and start your day with extra points. You don’t need any special knowledge for these polls. They’re often fun questions about pop culture or current events. Sometimes they ask about your opinions or habits. For example, one of my questions recently was “What are you most looking forward to this Halloween?” The answers included “Taking the kids trick-or-treating,” “Dressing up and going to a Halloween costume party,” and “I don’t do anything for Halloween.” See? Very easy! 8. Play online games Swagbucks lets you earn points by playing games, and it’s a fun way to make some extra cash while relaxing. You can find games in the “Play” section of the Swagbucks website or app. There are many types to choose from, like puzzles, card games, and strategy games. Some games are free to play. Others might cost a small amount to join, but you can win bigger prizes. Some games that you can play include Monopoly Go, Animals \u0026 Coins, Solitaire Smash, Bingo Blitz, and Dice Dreams. Now, you won’t get rich playing games on Swagbucks. But it’s a nice bonus if you enjoy gaming anyway. You can earn a few extra points while having fun. Also, there are many other sites like Swagbucks where you can make money playing game apps. The best game apps that pay real money include Freecash, KashKick, Swagbucks, and InboxDollars. 9. Download apps Swagbucks rewards you for downloading different apps, like financial apps. For example, you may get points for signing up for a travel rewards credit card, signing up for a high-yield savings account, checking your credit score, signing up for PayPal, and more. Usually, you’ll need to download the app and create an account to get your reward. Some offers may require you to keep the app for a certain time or make a small deposit (you’ll want to read the terms carefully before starting any offer so that you are sure you understand what’s needed to get your SB points). 10. Use SwagButton for cash back The SwagButton is a cash back tool that fits right into your web browser as a browser extension, and once installed tells you when you get cash back at online stores. The SwagButton also applies coupon codes to your shopping cart so that you can save money when shopping online. For example, you may get 1% cash back at Walmart. There are many other retailers such as Amazon, Best Buy, eBay, Home Depot, Old Navy, and more. Cash-back tools like the Swagbutton are great because they let me earn money on purchases I was already planning to make. It feels like getting rewarded just for shopping, and the savings really add up over time. Plus, it’s so easy – just a quick click before checking out, and I’m earning cash back without any extra effort. 11. Use a separate email address to sign up for Swagbucks When you join Swagbucks, it’s smart to use a different email address than your main one. This helps keep your regular inbox clean and organized. For me, I like to have a separate email address that I use for all of the different money making apps that I use so that I can keep everything in one place. Swagbucks and other rewards sites can sometimes send lots of emails about offers and surveys. By using a separate email, you can check these messages when you want without cluttering your main account. You might get emails about new ways to earn points or special deals. Having them in one place makes it easy to find good opportunities. It’s easy to set up a new email address just for Swagbucks. You can use free services like Gmail to create one quickly. Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about the best Swagbucks hacks and using Swagbucks. Is there a catch to Swagbucks? Is Swagbucks safe? Yes, Swagbucks is safe to use. It’s a real company that pays its members. There’s no big catch, but you won’t get rich quick. You earn small amounts for tasks like surveys and watching videos. I have personally earned over 100 free gift cards on Swagbucks. Can you make a living off Swagbucks? You can’t make a living from Swagbucks alone. It’s best as extra money, not a full-time job.

You’d need to spend many hours and complete lots of high-paying tasks. It’s not a realistic daily goal for most users. Can I make $1,000 a month with Swagbucks? Earning $1,000 a month on Swagbucks is tough. It would take a lot of time and effort. Some users might reach this, but it’s not common. How much money can you make on Swagbucks in a day? Your daily earnings can vary. On average, you might make $1 to $5 a day with regular use. Some days you could earn more if you find good offers or surveys. Some games can pay well, but it may take a week or longer to earn the extra income from playing game apps. Where can I get swag codes? You can find swag codes on the Swagbucks social media pages.

Complete surveys\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSurveys are a great way to earn Swagbucks points. You can find lots of them on the site. But not all surveys are the same. Some give you more points than others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI recommend that you look for surveys that pay more SB points, as these are more likely to be worth your time. Check how long each survey takes and how many points it gives. Skip the ones that don’t pay much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, when I log in to Swagbucks, I see this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ea 32-minute survey that pays 275 points\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003ea 35-minute survey that pays 150 points\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI see a lot more surveys than that, but the above shows you how different the surveys can pay for a similar amount of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTry to pick surveys that give you the most points for your time. This way, you can earn more without spending all day on the site. It’s smart to focus on the best-paying surveys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, you may log in and see that some say “Guaranteed” next to the points amount. This means that you are guaranteed to qualify, so this may make it worth it to take the survey as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I answer survey questions on Swagbucks, there are times when I get rejected because I don’t fit the target demographic for that specific survey. It can be frustrating, but it’s part of the process, and there are always other surveys to try. So, finding “guaranteed” surveys can be nice because you know you won’t get rejected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, there are many other survey companies you can sign up for, such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/SurveyJunkie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSurvey Junkie\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/AmericanConsumerOpinion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eAmerican Consumer Opinion\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/brandedsurveys\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBranded Surveys\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/prime-opinion-top-picks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePrime Opinion\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRecommended reading:\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/2019/07/paid-online-surveys.html\"\u003e20 Best Paid Survey Sites To Make $100+ Per Month\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"550\" data-pin-description=\"swagbucks hacks invite friends\" src=\"https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/swagbucks-hacks-invite-friends-1024x550.png\" alt=\"swagbucks hacks invite friends\" srcset=\"https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/swagbucks-hacks-invite-friends-1024x550.png 1024w, https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/swagbucks-hacks-invite-friends-300x161.png 300w, https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/swagbucks-hacks-invite-friends-768x413.png 768w, https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/swagbucks-hacks-invite-friends-1536x825.png 1536w, https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/swagbucks-hacks-invite-friends-2048x1100.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/swagbucks-hacks-invite-friends.png\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4.
