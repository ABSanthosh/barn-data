If you‚Äôre looking for some new reads to sink your teeth into, let me present 6 new ones from our community that have recently hit shelves, covering everything from stoicism, to money paths, to millionaire habits, to even something I bet you haven‚Äôt ever heard before: ‚Äúthe energetics of personal finance‚Äù ;) Some of these are new-new, some are a few months old as I tagged them during my accidental sabbatical and missed the promo time, lol, and another won‚Äôt hit the shelves until two weeks so you‚Äôre gonna be one of the first to hear about it! And the best part? We‚Äôre giving away TWO COPIES of each book here! So scroll to the end to see how to enter, and hopefully you‚Äôll be one of the lucky winners to snag one üëä Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve got: ******* The Stoic Path to Wealth: Ancient Wisdom for Enduring Prosperity I‚Äôve been a fan of Darius‚Äô blog for a number of years now, so was super stoked to learn his latest book focuses on the more emotional side to investing and growing wealth. Something most of us struggle hard with! He has some other classics too around productivity, forming better habits, and generally just living well, but this is the first book I believe to focus on *money* specifically. Even the OG Morgan Housel gave a testimonial on it! Here‚Äôs a clip from its Amazon page: ‚ÄúThe Stoics understood that if you can control your reactions and manage your emotions, you can achieve success. The same principles apply to our financial lives today. The greatest investors approach the markets with discipline, emotional distance, and self-mastery‚Äîlessons that the Stoics have been teaching us for thousands of years. Combining ancient wisdom with practical investment strategies drawn from analysis of the greatest investors of all time, The Stoic Path to Wealth will teach you how to: cultivate an investing edge by managing your emotions and developing your unique skills and talents develop the discipline to ignore short-term market fluctuations and avoid living in the future foster a mindset that allows you to enjoy what you have and avoid greed create a sustainable approach to trading‚Äù To learn more or purchase: The Stoic Path to Wealth ******* Millionaire Habits: How to Achieve Financial Independence, Retire Early, and Make a Difference by Focusing on Yourself First This is the first book from long-time blogger, Steve Adcock, of Millionaire Habits, and while you‚Äôll probably either love this one or hate it as Steve can get pretty feisty, lol, the overall message here will always remain true: when you become financially free you have more time, and energy, to give back to not only yourself but those around you too. But first you must focus on yourself! Here‚Äôs more about the book per Amazon: ‚ÄúIn Millionaire Habits, popular personal finance educator Steve Adcock delivers a fun, insightful, and hands-on discussion of how to build financial security, retire early, and give back to the community. You‚Äôll learn to focus on yourself and your family first, creating personal wealth for the purpose of giving back to others. In the book, the author explains that ‚Äúsaving money‚Äù isn‚Äôt a goal in and of itself, but rather the end product of the personal wealth equation: Wealth = Income + Investments ‚Äì Lifestyle. You‚Äôll discover how to pay yourself first with concrete guidance and practical advice drawn from people who built wealth on modest incomes. You‚Äôll also find: Strategies for maintaining your physical and financial fitness so you can maximize the value of your assets Ways to turn your existing wealth into even more valuable investments that generate continued, passive income Methods to help you retire early and enjoy your financial independence at a young age Perfect for young professionals, working families, self-employed people, and anyone else seeking to increase their net worth and get more out of life.‚Äù To learn more or purchase: Millionaire Habits [You might also recall Steve‚Äôs name from the Rockstar Finance days as he was the brains behind all of our tech, allowing us to expand and add features at lightning speed ‚Äì at one point launching new endeavors with each passing month, whether it was the Blog Directory, the Forums, or the Feed Database where anyone could read any blog post being published across the world! It was fun times, and I owe a lot of the success of the project to Steve. So thanks for everything, buddy ‚Äì always enjoy working with ya ü§ô] PS: Steve also has an FI Accelerator course if you learn better through action-oriented tasks: FI/Accelerator: Step-by-Step Guide to Achieving Financial Independence ******* The Get Ready Blueprint: A 52-Week Guide to Changing the Way You Think About Money This book comes from Tony Steuer who recently had me on his podcast, and if the book is anything like the fun conversations we had there I think you‚Äôll enjoy it. I haven‚Äôt personally read it, but I‚Äôm always a fan of books that not only tell you the *why* behind stuff, but also the *how*. And this one seems from afar at least that it merges both of them nicely. If you win it you‚Äôll have to let me know if I was correct! ;) Here‚Äôs a clip from Amazon: ‚ÄúThe Get Ready! Blueprint is an essential 52-week planner that helps you understand your financial goals and create and achieve your own strong financial decisions. With this easy-to-use road map and clear action steps, you‚Äôll gain an overall view of how everything in your financial life fits together and how to maintain it. You‚Äôll begin by building useful habits, then put them to use in planning, calculating, and reviewing key financial information. With Tony Steuer‚Äôs proven ‚ÄúGet Ready Method,‚Äù you can understand your big financial picture find clarity to evaluate whether financial products meet your goals establish the essential eight habits that will empower you with your money use the innovative calendar system to help you keep all areas of your financial life up to date and on track‚Äù To learn more or purchase: The Get Ready Blueprint ******* Provider Money, Pleasure Money: The Energetics of Personal Finance Okay ‚Äì now to the ‚Äúenergetics‚Äù one :) Which is brought to you by long-time blog reader, and blogger herself, Christine Luken. Another book I have a feeling you‚Äôll either love or hate, but even if you‚Äôre just a little into the energies of the world, or into yoga or reiki or any of those more ‚Äúwoo‚Äù practices on the fringes I think you‚Äôll appreciate this one. At the very least to get a *different* perspective that you might not have otherwise considered. You never know what might click! Here‚Äôs a snippet from Amazon: ‚ÄúWe often think of money as bills and coins, checking and savings accounts, paychecks and passive income. Yet, at its essence, money is financial energy; that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called ‚Äúcurrency.‚Äù There are two distinct and complementary energies, the yin and yang, in personal finance: Provider money and Pleasure money. Discover the nature of these two energic forces and how they overlay the entirety of your personal finances. Seeing your money through this energetic lens is a paradigm shift, a philosophy of money rather than a strict how-to guide. After reading this book, you will have the knowledge and confidence to balance Provider and Pleasure energies, creating a financial life that supports your happiness and peace of mind.‚Äù To learn more or purchase: Provider Money, Pleasure Money ******* Plan Your Money Path: A Guide to Create Your Own Financial Plan This one comes from long-time reader and frequent publisher, Bill Hines, who‚Äôs always kind enough to offer up some free copies to us here. His last book you might recall was ‚ÄúKiss Your Money Hello!: (And Financial Stress Goodbye)‚Äù and just an overall passionate and great guy. Here‚Äôs more about the book from Amazon: ‚ÄúImagine how well you‚Äôd sleep at night knowing your boxes are checked‚Äîeverything the kids will need, all your dreams right on through early retirement, when you‚Äôre young enough to enjoy those dreams. This book shows you how to take control and build your own financial plan, using high fidelity, inexpensive software, not the dumbed-down financial/retirement planning tools you find all over the internet. I‚Äôll take you through some important general financial planning context, and then through the steps to building a financial plan for a sample family. Along the way, we‚Äôll discuss the different inputs and assumptions required for any financial plan, as well as how to interpret the results and put your plan into action.‚Äù To learn more or purchase: Plan Your Money Path [FYI: This one hasn‚Äôt hit the shelves yet, but we‚Äôll get the winners a physical copy by the end of Sept!] ******* The Wealth Paradox: Navigating Money, Free will, and Success: How Unconventional Thinking Influences Your Financial And Personal Life Lastly, a new book from Alain Guillot ‚Äì a long-time friend of the blog! This one has only been released as a *Kindle* book, however Alain was kind enough to shoot me a PDF version of it so the two winners will receive that for easy access. Here‚Äôs more about it per Amazon: ‚ÄúThis book is a culmination of years spent navigating the complex landscape of personal finance, entrepreneurship, and self-discovery. It‚Äôs about the lessons learned from both success and failure, and the lessons I learned from the experiences of others, including some of the most successful minds of our time. The book is composed of 10 chapters in which I share my ideas on managing money, yourself‚Äîyour mind, your habits, and your expectations. We‚Äôll explore topics that challenge conventional wisdom, such as the role of gender in success, the myths surrounding investment choices, and the often-overlooked impact of childhood experiences on our adult lives. As you turn the pages, you‚Äôll move from basic financial knowledge to ideas of what it means to thrive in a world that often feels uncertain.‚Äù To learn more or purchase:¬†The Wealth Paradox ******* Okay!
