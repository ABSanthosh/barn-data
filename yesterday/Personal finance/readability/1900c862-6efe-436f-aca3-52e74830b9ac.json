But over time, it grew into something bigger. It wasn’t easy, but I’m glad I took the leap. Now… Do you want to turn your side hustle into your full-time job? I never thought my side gig would become my full-time job. It started as a way to make extra cash in my spare time. But over time, it grew into something bigger. It wasn’t easy, but I’m glad I took the leap. Now I get to do what I love every day. If you’ve been wanting to turn your side hustle into a full-time job, here’s my story that you can follow. My Journey From Hobby to Full-Time Job I never thought my blog would become my job. It started as a fun way to share money tips. I didn’t even know blogs could make money! At first, I just wanted to pay off my student loans. I worked hard on my blog in my free time. As I learned more, I got excited about the idea of earning money from it. As I poured more time and energy into my blog, I realized how much I loved it. I began to wonder if it could be more than just a hobby. Could this small project actually support me full-time? That curiosity sparked a new chapter in my life – one where I set goals, worked hard, and eventually turned my side hustle into a full-time business. Slowly, my blog grew. I took courses and learned from other bloggers. There were lots of ups and downs. But I kept going because I loved it. Now, my blog is my full-time job. It lets me work from anywhere and spend more time with family. I’ve even earned over $5 million over the years from blogging! In this article, I’ll tell you how I turned my side hustle into my full-time job. If you’ve ever dreamed of taking your side hustle to the next level, this post will show you exactly how I made it happen – and how you can too. Recommended reading: 10 Best Things I Did To Build A $5 Million Dollar Blog 1. I started my blog as a side hustle Of course, the first step is to actually start your side hustle. I started Making Sense of Cents in 2011 as a fun way to track my money. At the time, I was working a full-time job and had no idea blogs could make money. My blog was just a hobby at first. I wrote about paying off my student loans and other money stuff I was doing and learning. It was exciting to connect with people who had similar goals and I really enjoyed reading personal blogs. After about six months, something amazing happened – a friend told me someone wanted to pay $100 to put an ad on my blog and I couldn’t believe it! That $100 was a huge deal. It showed me that my little side project could actually earn money. I got really curious and started looking into how to make more money. I kept writing and learning. Soon, I was making $1,000 a month from my blog. Two years in, it grew to $10,000 a month (you can read all of my business income reports over the years at Blog Income Reports From A Multi-Million Blog (My Real Reports!) – all while I still had my day job! Also, you can learn how to start a blog in my free How To Start A Blog Course. In this free course, I show you how to create a blog, from the technical side to earning your first income and attracting readers. Over 80,000 people have taken it! 2. I set clear goals and a plan Once I realized that I could possibly turn my side hustle into a full-time job, I knew I had to make a plan. But, when I started my side hustle, I didn’t have a clear plan. I was just excited to make extra money. So, I sat down and wrote out what I wanted to achieve. My main goal was to replace my full-time job income pretty much as soon as I could. And, I also set smaller goals along the way. These included finding ways to diversify my business income and growing my traffic. You can apply this same approach to your side hustle by taking the time to map out your goals. Start by identifying your ultimate vision – what do you want your side hustle to achieve? Then, break that down into smaller, actionable steps that you can work on week by week. For example, if you want to earn $2,000 a month, calculate how many clients, sales, or projects you need to hit that number. Create a timeline for when you want to achieve each milestone and track your progress along the way. 3. I grew my side hustle After earning my first $100 from an advertisement on my blog, I knew there was more to this side hustle. I decided to take my side hustle seriously and committed to growing it into something bigger. The first step was investing time into learning everything I could about blogging, monetization, and marketing. I took courses, read articles, and studied successful bloggers to understand what worked. For example, one of the things that I focused on was creating high-quality content that solved problems for my readers. Consistency was key – I made a schedule and stuck to it and made sure I regularly posted valuable articles. You can apply this approach to your side hustle too. Start by dedicating consistent time each week to focus on growth – whether that’s improving your skills, finding new clients, or creating a stronger product. Plus, research your industry to see what works for others and think about how you can stand out.

I diversified my income streams When I first started my side hustle, my income came from one main source – blog ads. While this was exciting at first, I realized that relying on a single income stream was risky. If something happened to that one source, my entire side hustle could suffer. So, I wanted to look for other ways to make money on my blog. I added affiliate marketing to my blog by recommending products and services I genuinely used and loved. I also diversified the products that I promoted as well as the traffic that I received (more on this in the next section). Later, I created my own digital products, like courses, which opened up even more opportunities for income. Each of these income streams grew slowly over time but together gave me stability and flexibility for my business. You can apply this strategy to your side hustle too. Think about other ways you can generate income. For example, if you’re freelancing, you may want to try creating a package of your services or selling templates. If you have a product-based business, you may want to look into adding complementary products or selling subscriptions. Having many income streams helped me feel more secure. If one area slowed down, the others could keep money coming in. Recommended reading: 31 Best Stay At Home Jobs (#1 Is My Full Time Job!) 5. I built a loyal audience I knew I needed people to read my blog if I wanted it to become my full-time job. Plus, I wanted to diversify my traffic so that my readers didn’t all come from the same place. I focused on growing my traffic from places such as: Pinterest Email Google SEO Facebook And I also tested out any other possible methods, such as Flipboard. I took lots of courses and read as many traffic guides as I could because I wanted to grow my blog. After all, the more traffic I could get, then the more money I could probably make. To get more customers, you can start by identifying who your ideal customers are and what they’re looking for. Then, focus on creating products, services, or content that directly meet their needs. Use social media platforms where they spend the most time to share valuable tips, showcase your expertise, and connect with them personally. Collect their email addresses to stay in touch and nurture the relationship by sending helpful updates or special offers. Word of mouth is also powerful – ask happy customers to refer others or leave reviews. 6. I brainstormed challenges and how to overcome them When you’re running a business, issues and challenges can happen all the time. By thinking about these ahead of time, you can possibly come up with backup plans so that you are not as surprised. So, I made it a habit to anticipate obstacles and think of solutions before they arose. I knew there would be tough times – slow traffic, technical issues, or even feeling overwhelmed – but planning ahead helped me stay prepared. You can use this approach too by brainstorming potential challenges in your side hustle and how you’d handle them. For instance, if you’re worried about slow growth, think about ways to expand your reach, like trying new platforms or having special promotions. Some challenges you may come across include: What you will do if you have a low-income month or if you are to be impacted by seasonal income dips How you can compete with larger and more established businesses How you can handle future growth without sacrificing quality (will you hire out?) 7. I tested the waters with a trial period At one point, I was working full-time both at my day job and on my side hustle business (around 100 hours per week). I did this so that I could make as much money as possible (and beef up my savings), as well as fully test out my side hustle with full-time hours. Before fully committing to your side hustle as your full-time career, it’s a good idea to test the waters with a trial period. I like doing this because it gives you a chance to see how possible your side hustle can be without taking on the full risk of leaving your job right away. During this time, dedicate evenings, weekends, or any extra hours to working on your side hustle as if it were your full-time job. This trial period can help you identify potential challenges, such as time management issues, inconsistent income, or the workload required to maintain your business. It’s also an opportunity to experiment with new strategies, refine what you’re selling, and determine whether your side hustle is even possible. Another benefit of a trial period is that it allows you to build a financial safety net. I used the extra income from my side hustle to save money and pay down debt so that I would be in a stronger position when I transitioned to full-time. While a trial period can definitely feel very time-consuming as you juggle your day job and side hustle, it’s a great way to ease into entrepreneurship. Think of it as a low-risk way to test your readiness, work through challenges, and build confidence before fully committing. If the trial goes well, you’ll have a better understanding of what it takes to succeed and can move forward with a solid plan. 8. I paid off my debt I knew that if I wanted to run my business full-time and quit my day job, I wanted to pay off my student loans before doing so. This was because I didn’t want my debt to hold me back. I knew that blogging full-time was my dream, but I also understood the risks of self-employment. If I could eliminate my student loans first, I’d have fewer financial worries (my monthly expenses would be lower after all). It also became a challenge for me to make as much as I could through my business, so it was nice to put all of this extra money toward my debt. I ended up being able to pay off my $40,000 in student loan debt in just 7 months, which was an amazing feeling and I’m very proud of it. And, once my loans were gone, I felt ready to leave my job and focus 100% on the blog that had already changed my life. Recommended reading: How Blogging Paid Off My Student Loans 9. I made the leap Eventually, you have to make the leap and get over your fear – quit your job and actually pursue your side hustle full-time. It took me around two years to quit my day job and pursue my side hustle full-time. I realized it was time because I was spending around 100 hours a week between my day job and side hustle, and I simply couldn’t continue with both much longer – it was tiring managing both and I didn’t think it was worth it. Plus, I could clearly see that my blog income was growing steadily. It was exciting to see the numbers go up each month. Soon, I was making more from my blog than from my day job. This was a big moment for me. I had to decide if I should quit my job and focus on blogging full-time. It wasn’t an easy choice, but I knew I had to try. Leaving my steady job was scary. I worried about losing a regular paycheck, but I also felt thrilled about working on something I loved (I really, really disliked my day job but I knew it was safe). The first few months were tough. There were days when I wondered if I made the right choice. Plus, everyone was telling me that I was crazy. But as time went on, things got easier. I loved being able to set my own schedule. It felt great to write about topics I cared about. I also loved being my own boss, being in control of the income I was making, and not dreading the workday (to this day, I still look forward to opening my laptop and working on Making Sense of Cents!). The best part has been connecting with my readers – hearing how my blog helped them with their money problems makes all the hard work worth it. Over 10 years later, I’m still running this as my full-time career and making a great living with it. It’s been one of my best decisions in my life and I’m so glad that I made the leap and turned my side hustle into my full-time income.

Here are some common questions I get asked about this. How to turn a side hustle into a full-time job? To turn your side hustle into a full-time job, I recommend that you start by setting clear goals. Track how much you make from your side gig each week or month. When your side income matches or beats your day job pay, it might be time to go full-time. Plus, make sure you love what you’re doing. If your side hustle makes you happy and excited, that’s a good sign. It’s easier to work hard on something you enjoy. Can you have a side hustle while working full-time? Yes, you can have a side hustle and a full-time job at the same time. Many people do this to earn extra money or try out a new business idea. It’s important to check your work contract first. Some jobs have rules about outside work, so make sure your side gig doesn’t break any rules. I also think you should be careful not to let your side hustle affect your main job – do side work in your free time, not during work hours. How to juggle a full-time job and side hustle? To juggle a full-time job and side hustle, make a schedule and stick to it. Set aside specific times for your side hustle, like evenings or weekends, as this helps you stay organized and avoid burnout. And, use your time wisely by looking for ways to be more efficient in both your day job and side gig. This might mean waking up earlier or cutting back on TV time. What side hustles can be turned into a full-time income? There are many side hustles that you can turn into a full-time income, such as proofreading, freelance writing, bookkeeping, flipping items for resale, creating printables on Etsy, virtual assisting, consulting, remote home cleaning, and so much more.

After all, the more traffic I could get, then the more money I could probably make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo get more customers, you can start by identifying who your ideal customers are and what they’re looking for. Then, focus on creating products, services, or content that directly meet their needs. Use social media platforms where they spend the most time to share valuable tips, showcase your expertise, and connect with them personally. Collect their email addresses to stay in touch and nurture the relationship by sending helpful updates or special offers.

I knew there would be tough times – slow traffic, technical issues, or even feeling overwhelmed – but planning ahead helped me stay prepared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use this approach too by brainstorming potential challenges in your side hustle and how you’d handle them. For instance, if you’re worried about slow growth, think about ways to expand your reach, like trying new platforms or having special promotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome challenges you may come across include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhat you will do if you have a low-income month or if you are to be impacted by seasonal income dips\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eHow you can compete with larger and more established businesses\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eHow you can handle future growth without sacrificing quality (will you hire out?)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e7. I tested the waters with a trial period\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt one point, I was working full-time both at my day job and on my side hustle business (around 100 hours per week). I did this so that I could make as much money as possible (and beef up my savings), as well as fully test out my side hustle with full-time hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore fully committing to your side hustle as your full-time career, it’s a good idea to test the waters with a trial period. I like doing this because it gives you a chance to see how possible your side hustle can be without taking on the full risk of leaving your job right away. During this time, dedicate evenings, weekends, or any extra hours to working on your side hustle as if it were your full-time job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis trial period can help you identify potential challenges, such as time management issues, inconsistent income, or the workload required to maintain your business. It’s also an opportunity to experiment with new strategies, refine what you’re selling, and determine whether your side hustle is even possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother benefit of a trial period is that it allows you to build a financial safety net. I used the extra income from my side hustle to save money and pay down debt so that I would be in a stronger position when I transitioned to full-time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile a trial period can definitely feel very time-consuming as you juggle your day job and side hustle, it’s a great way to ease into entrepreneurship. Think of it as a low-risk way to test your readiness, work through challenges, and build confidence before fully committing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the trial goes well, you’ll have a better understanding of what it takes to succeed and can move forward with a solid plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e8.

I knew that blogging full-time was my dream, but I also understood the risks of self-employment. If I could eliminate my student loans first, I’d have fewer financial worries (my monthly expenses would be lower after all).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt also became a challenge for me to make as much as I could through my business, so it was nice to put all of this extra money toward my debt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up being able to pay off my $40,000 in student loan debt in just 7 months, which was an amazing feeling and I’m very proud of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, once my loans were gone, I felt ready to leave my job and focus 100% on the blog that had already changed my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRecommended reading:\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.makingsenseofcents.com/2016/04/blogging-paying-off-student-loans.html\"\u003eHow Blogging Paid Off My Student Loans\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e9.

Track how much you make from your side gig each week or month. When your side income matches or beats your day job pay, it might be time to go full-time. Plus, make sure you love what you’re doing. If your side hustle makes you happy and excited, that’s a good sign. It’s easier to work hard on something you enjoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan you have a side hustle while working full-time?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes, you can have a side hustle and a full-time job at the same time. Many people do this to earn extra money or try out a new business idea. It’s important to check your work contract first. Some jobs have rules about outside work, so make sure your side gig doesn’t break any rules. I also think you should be careful not to let your side hustle affect your main job – do side work in your free time, not during work hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to juggle a full-time job and side hustle?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo juggle a full-time job and side hustle, make a schedule and stick to it. Set aside specific times for your side hustle, like evenings or weekends, as this helps you stay organized and avoid burnout. And, use your time wisely by looking for ways to be more efficient in both your day job and side gig.
