To ease the burden, you might want to consider paying for bookkeeping and payroll services from a company like Block Advisors. Use the Block Advisors bookkeeping and payroll review below to compare Block Advisors’ plans, explore their features, and consider the biggest pros and cons of the service. What Is Block Advisors Bookkeeping and Payroll Services? Block Advisors is an arm of H\u0026R Block that offers individual plans for bookkeeping, payroll, and business formation. With each of these services, you can choose from a range of flexible plans at different price points, opting for the service that fits your business’s needs best. Block Advisors’ bookkeeping and payroll services stand out for giving you free consultations and access to a dedicated account manager. We’ll take a closer look at their key features below. Key Features of Block Advisors Payroll and Bookkeeping  Block Advisors’ payroll and bookkeeping plans are separate services you can enroll in. Here are some of the most important features to consider: Bookkeeping Features With its bookkeeping services, Block Advisors is dedicated to helping you ensure accurate books, save time, and stay on track. Free consultation: Every plan starts with a free consultation to assess your business’s bookkeeping needs and get a custom quote. Dedicated accountant: Full-service plans give you access to a dedicated account manager who knows the ins and outs of your books and has the expertise to manage them for you. Flexible communication: You can chat with your accountant via phone, video, or an in-person appointment when you need their services. Catch-Up bookkeeping: The first thing Block Advisors will do is to get your books up to date. Seamless transfer: Block Advisors can easily transfer your data from your Quickbooks account when you make the switch. Xero: You can get accurate books before tax season with Block Advisors’ expert support – with 100% accuracy guaranteed and access to Xero, a powerful online accounting software.  Payroll Features Going hand in hand with Bookkeeping, Block Advisors’ Payroll is designed to help you pay employees on time, stay compliant, and hand off your year-end tax filings. Dedicated accountant: Regardless of which payroll plan you choose, you’ll be provided with a dedicated accountant. Free consultation: Similar to bookkeeping, all payroll plans start with a free consultation to address your payroll needs. Ongoing services: Block Advisors manages your payroll at every pay cycle, handles all your payroll tax forms, and provides compliance and audit support when you enroll in a plan. Versatile plans: You can choose from three plans, from a Basic one for self-employed entrepreneurs to a Premium plan that includes HR assistance and benefits for small businesses. Fees Cost is an important consideration when you’re comparing services for your business.  We found Block Advisors’ pricing to be flexible and fair for the services it provides. While there are less expensive payroll and bookkeeping alternatives on the market, they tend to be DIY platforms that don’t give you a dedicated accountant. Here’s a breakdown of Block Advisors’ pricing, with details on what each plan provides. Bookkeeping Fees Self-Service: For $39 per month, you can get easy income and expense management tools, receipt capture, and standard reporting, with a Bookkeeping 101 Guide to help you along the way. Full-Service: Starting at $175 per month, the Full-Service plan gives you features such as a dedicated accountant, a year-to-date review of your books, and custom financial statements. Premium: Starting at $299 per month, the Premium plan provides additional benefits like mileage, inventory, expense management, project tracking estimates, and accrual-based accounting. Payroll Fees Basic: Starting at $59 per month, the Basic plan gives you a dedicated accountant, standard reporting, single-state payroll, and streamlined account setup. Plus: The Plus plan starts at $79 per month, plus $10 for every additional employee. It offers additional perks such as payouts for contractors, comprehensive reporting, and W2s and 1099s. Premium: At $140 per month, plus $10 per employee, the Premium plan offers more comprehensive benefits like HR tools, timekeeping, and workers’ compensation insurance. Getting Started To get started with a Bookkeeping or Payroll plan from Block Advisors, you’ll need to schedule a free consultation.  When you select your business’s location on the Block Advisors website, you’ll be prompted to schedule your appointment.  Once you have your 30-minute consultation, the Block Advisors team will provide you with a custom quote for your services based on your business’s needs and help you enroll. Block Advisors Customer Service Based on our research, Block Advisors is a solid choice in terms of customer service. It doesn’t have scores of customer reviews on sites like the Better Business Bureau and Trustpilot as it’s a newer service. That being said, H\u0026R Block has an excellent reputation, and we’ve found Block Advisors’ customer support to be very accessible. You can reach customer service by phone or visit one of H\u0026R Block’s brick-and-mortar branches in your area for face-to-face assistance. When you enroll in any of Block Advisors’ payroll or bookkeeping plans, you also get a 100% satisfaction guarantee, which not all companies offer. Pros and Cons Before you sign up with Block Advisors take a moment to consider its biggest benefits, along with a few potential drawbacks: Pros  Dedicated account manager: Most Block Advisors’ payroll and bookkeeping plans provide you with a dedicated accountant. Free consultations: Both bookkeeping and payroll services start with a free consultation to present you with services tailored to your business needs, ensuring you get the right level of support. Bookkeeping for up to half the price: Block Advisors has full-service package rates up to 50% less than a typical accountant. Cons Higher cost: While the services are comprehensive, some of Block Advisors’ plans can be more expensive than DIY platforms, which might be a drawback for budget-conscious small businesses. Limited reviews: Block Advisors doesn’t have many customer reviews available online, making it harder to gauge customer satisfaction and reliability. Bottom Line We found that Block Advisors’ Payroll and Bookkeeping Services offer custom-made comprehensive solutions for small businesses looking for professional financial management.  With dedicated account managers, flexible plans, and a satisfaction guarantee, Block Advisors provides valuable support that can save you time and take the stress of bookkeeping and payroll off your shoulders, freeing you up to do more of what you love. If you need dependable bookkeeping and payroll management with human support, Block Advisors is a solid choice.",
