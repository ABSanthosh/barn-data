They work hard (very, very hard!), but the opportunities they have to explore the world are incredible. I spoke to many of them, and they shared how rewarding it is to visit so many countries while being able to make money.

The bartenders were friendly, quick to remember our favorite drinks, and they shared great stories about life at sea. Their service added a personal touch to our experience, making us feel like regulars even though we were far from home. And, many of the bartenders had been doing the job for over a decade, and they often told us the pay was great and allowed their families to live a comfortable life at home. It seemed to be a good job that people really wanted on a cruise ship! Bartenders make tasty cocktails for passengers. They also serve beer, wine, and other drinks. It’s your job to keep the bar stocked and clean too. 10. Spa worker Cruise ships have fancy spas where guests go to unwind and feel pampered. As a spa worker, you could give massages, do facials, or style hair. You might paint nails or help people relax in the sauna. There are lots of ways to make guests feel good. The best part? You get to travel the world while you work. Cruise ships go to amazing places like Alaska and the Caribbean. You can explore new ports on your days off. Cruise ship spas need managers, massage therapists, hair stylists, and more. You’ll work hard, but the views are great. 11. Photographer During our cruise, the onboard photographers helped us capture so many special memories. Whether it was a formal dinner or a fun day at port, they were always around to take great photos that we’ll keep forever.
