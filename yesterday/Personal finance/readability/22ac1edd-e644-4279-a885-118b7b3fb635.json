If you’re among them, you may be wondering, “Are banks closed on the 4th of July 2025?” If so, here’s everything you need to know.Are Banks Closed on the 4th of July, 2025?Yes, banks are closed on the 4th of July. While banks aren’t required to close on federal holidays, they typically do, including on Independence Day. As a result, you won’t be able to head to the bank on Friday, July 4, 2025, even though that’s a day of the week when banks are usually open.Are Credit Unions Closed on the 4th of July, 2025?Like banks, most credit unions close on federal holidays. Since that’s the case, expect them to close on Independence Day, even with the holiday falling on a Tuesday.Banking Services Available on the 4th of JulyWhile bank and credit union branches are primarily closed on the 4th of July, that doesn’t mean you can’t get some banking activities handled. ATMs located outside of secured branches are available, giving you a place for withdrawals, deposits, and transfers, as well as bill-paying services at locations that support them through kiosks. Additionally, online banking services are usually available. You can check balances, transfer funds, make deposits, and schedule bill payments.Just be aware that some online or ATM activities may not start processing until the next business day. In this case, that means Friday, July 5, 2025. If you have an urgent matter, it’s best to head to the bank or credit union before the 4th of July, ensuring the transaction can start processing (and potentially complete) before the holiday.2025 Bank and Credit Union Holiday ScheduleEvery bank and credit union has the option of setting its own holiday schedule, but most choose to follow the federal one. Since that’s the case, you can use the federal holiday schedule to predict bank and credit union closures.Here is a list of 2025 bank and credit union holidays:New Year’s Day – Wednesday, January 1Martin Luther King, Jr. Day – Monday, January 20President’s Day – Monday, February 17Memorial Day – Monday, May 26Juneteenth – Thursday, June 19Independence Day – Friday, July 4Labor Day – Monday, September 1Columbus Day – Monday, October 13Veterans Day – Tuesday, November 11Thanksgiving Day – Thursday, November 27Christmas Day – Thursday, December 25It’s also important to note that banks and credit unions typically close on Sundays. As a result, they’re closed on Easter, Mother’s Day, and Father’s Day every year.Have you ever needed to head to the back on a holiday only to find it was closed, or have holiday bank closures never been an issue? Do you think it makes sense that banks are closed on the 4th of July, or do you feel they should be open? Share your thoughts in the comments below.Amanda Blankenship is a full-time stay-at-home mom.
