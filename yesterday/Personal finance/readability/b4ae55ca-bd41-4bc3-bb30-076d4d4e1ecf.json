This can be a great way to combine your passion for animals with making extra money. There are many ways animal lovers can make money on the side. You could walk dogs, pet sit, or… Do you love animals? If so, you might be excited to learn about the best side hustles for animal lovers. This can be a great way to combine your passion for animals with making extra money. There are many ways animal lovers can make money on the side. You could walk dogs, pet sit, or even take pictures of cute animals. Some people bake dog treats or help train dogs. These side jobs let you spend time with animals while making more money, which means you can enjoy your time while you earn money! I personally have several friends and family members who have animal side hustles (I have many family members who work with dogs, horses, farm animals, bees, and more!), and they all seem to really love working with animals. Yes, it can be hard work, but it is rewarding. Best Side Hustles for Animal Lovers Below are the best ways for animal lovers to make extra money. 1. Sell dog treats A dog treat bakery can be a fun and profitable side hustle for animal lovers. Many pet owners want high-quality, healthy treats for their pets, and homemade options are in high demand. I have bought many homemade dog treats over the years, and they are such a great treat to give to your pets. Plus, you may be able to start this business right from your home kitchen with just a few simple ingredients and tools. To get started, you can try making basic dog biscuits using pet-safe ingredients like peanut butter, pumpkin, or sweet potato (here’s a free peanut butter dog treat recipe you can try!). The startup costs are low since you likely already have most of the kitchen tools you need. Your main expenses will be ingredients and packaging. As you grow, you can try selling different items like specialty treats, birthday cakes for dogs, or seasonal items for holidays (people love to spoil their animals because it’s fun after all!). A home-based dog treat business can earn between $500 to $1,000 a month as a side hustle. If you decide to go full-time, the potential earnings can be much higher! You can sell at farmers markets, local pet shops, or even online through Etsy and social media. You can learn more at How I’ve Made $4,000 In A Month Baking Dog Treats (With Zero Baking Experience!). 2. Veterinary technician Veterinary technicians work with veterinarians and help with daily tasks like weighing animals that come into the office, keeping pets calm, giving medications (as directed by a vet), helping with exams, and more. While many veterinary technicians work full-time, it is possible to find part-time vet tech jobs. You may be able to find part-time vet tech jobs at local veterinary clinics, animal shelters and rescues, pet boarding facilities, and zoos. Vet techs typically make around $15 to $25 an hour, and it mainly depends on where you live. 3. Pet sitting and dog walking Pet sitting and dog walking are great ways to make money while hanging out with animals. You can watch pets in your home or go to the owner’s house. It’s great if you love animals and have some free time. Many pet owners need help when they travel or work long hours. You might feed pets, take them for walks, or just keep them company. Some pets need special care, like giving medicine or extra attention. You can find pet sitting jobs through apps or websites, and you can see my top list at 7 Best Dog Walking Apps To Make Extra Money. Rover and Wag are popular platforms that connect pet sitters with owners. You can also ask friends and neighbors if they need help with their pets. My husband’s mother is a dog walker and has many consistent clients. It’s a job that looks like fun, especially if you like spending time with dogs and cats. I also have hired and used dog sitters many times over the years, and I am always so grateful for their services! 4. Animal photography If you love animals and taking pictures, then animal photography might be the perfect animal side hustle for you! Many pet owners want cute photos of their animals. You can sell pet portrait sessions or action shots of animals playing. You can advertise your services on social media (such as by building a portfolio of animal photography and sharing it on your Instagram account) or at local pet stores. Pricing can vary, but pet photo sessions usually cost around $100 to $200. With practice, you could make some nice extra money doing something fun with animals. 5. Custom pet portraits Another side hustle for animal lovers that is similar to the one above is making custom pet portraits. If you love to draw or paint, then you may be able to turn your artistic skills into a fun side hustle by creating custom pet portraits. Many pet owners want special artwork of their pets. I have personally bought maybe 5 or 6 custom pet portraits for family members as gifts over the years as well! They were all watercolor portraits of their dogs that they then put up on their wall (because they were so cute and well done!). Here’s an example of custom pet portraits on Etsy to give you a better idea of what I’m talking about. You can offer different styles like watercolor, digital art, or sketches. Then, set up an online shop to showcase your work and take orders. Social media is great for sharing your pet portraits and finding customers too. 6. Pet grooming Many pet owners don’t have the time or skills to keep their pets clean and tidy. Pet groomers wash, brush, and trim animals’ fur. You might also clip their nails and clean their ears. It’s a hands-on job that lets you work closely with all kinds of pets. You can start small by offering services to friends and family. As you build skills and confidence, you can expand your client base. Some groomers work from home, while others set up mobile grooming vans. To get started with a pet grooming job, you will want to learn basic grooming techniques online or through local classes. While not required, getting certified can help you attract more clients because it shows that you know how to keep pets safe and comfortable during grooming. 7. Pet relocation Pet relocation is a great side hustle for animal lovers. You can help pets move to new homes or travel with their owners. With a pet relocation job, you’ll need to learn about pet travel rules because each country and airline has its own rules. For example, you may need to help pet owners get the right papers and shots for their pets. Your main job will be to make sure pets are safe and comfortable during their trip. You might book flights, get travel crates, and take pets to the airport. Some people even fly with the pets to make sure they’re okay. Not all pet relocation jobs are via air. Many will consist of you moving the pet via your car, and bringing them across the country, for example. Sometimes people do not have the time to drive a long distance in their car with their pet, but they also do not want to put their pet in the airplane storage area (because it can be dangerous), so they pay someone to transport their pet. This side hustle can be fun and rewarding because you get to help pets and their owners during a big change in their lives. To get started, you can look for pet relocation companies that need help (a simple Google search of “pet relocation company” brings up several). Or you can start your own business.

Start an animal blog If you love animals and want to make money writing, then starting an animal blog may be the idea for you! Here are some ideas for what you can talk about on a blog about animals: Pet care and training Pet health and wellness DIY pet projects (like making dog treats, pet beds, etc.) Traveling with pets Wildlife, conservation, and nature Farm and homesteading Pet fashion Dog breed guides Senior pet care And so much more!

Recommended reading: The 25 Most-Asked Blogging Questions To Get You Started Today 9. Pet training services Many pet owners need help teaching their pets good behavior and fun tricks. If you have experience training animals, then this can be a good and rewarding side hustle. People hire animal trainers for all kinds of animals, such as dogs, cats, and even exotic pets. Yes, there is more than just dog training! Examples of what you can sell include: Puppy training classes Potty training assistance Off-leash training Obedience training Cat training (such as help with litter box issues or unwanted scratching) Horse training Exotic pet training (teach basic commands and handling techniques for birds, rabbits, or reptiles) And so much more. There are many different pet side hustles related to training that you can offer. 10. Pet print on demand Selling pet products, such as print-on-demand products, could be your perfect side hustle! Print-on-demand is when you create custom designs for products like: Custom pet tags Dog and cat collars Pet bandanas Pet clothing like dog sweaters Pet bowls Wall art and prints Mugs (with sayings that are related to animals or have animals printed on them) Tote bags Greeting cards And so much more. What’s great about print-on-demand is that you don’t need to keep any inventory. When someone buys your product, the print-on-demand company makes it and ships it for you. You can learn more at How I Make $1,500 Monthly With My Print-On-Demand Business. I also recommend signing up for the freebie 17 Hot-Selling Print-on-Demand Products That Can Pay for Your Next Vacation and More! to learn more. 10Print-On-Demand Free GuideThis freebie will teach you about print-on-demand as well as give you a list of 17 hot-selling products you can sell via print on demand. 11. Horse care services If you love horses, then you may be able to turn your passion into a side hustle that makes you money. Horse care services are in high demand, and many horse owners need help with daily tasks. Some services you could sell include: Grooming services: This includes brushing, washing, and trimming horses. Feeding and watering horses: Some owners need someone to do this daily or when they’re away. You’d make sure the horses have fresh food and water. Cleaning stalls is an important job too. It keeps horses healthy and comfortable. You’d remove dirty bedding and replace it with fresh materials. Exercise is so important for horses. You could offer to walk or ride horses for owners who are busy. This keeps the horses fit and happy. You can start a horse care side hustle by reaching out to local stables or horse owners. 12. Beekeeping Beekeeping can be a sweet side job for animal lovers. You get to care for bees and harvest honey. I know three different families who have a beekeeping side hustle. They sell small batches of honey at farmers markets and to people that they know. We have been thinking about starting this as well, mainly just for ourselves so that we can have some fresh honey. You’ll need some basic equipment. This includes hives, protective gear, and tools. You can join a local beekeeping group to learn more because they often offer classes and support for beginners. Beekeeping does take time and patience – you’ll need to check on your hives regularly and make sure the bees are healthy and have enough food. You’ll also need to protect them from pests and bad weather. 13. Wildlife biologist A wildlife biologist could be a great side job for you if you love animals. Wildlife biologists study animals in their natural homes to better understand them. This is usually a full-time job, but I wanted to include it in this article because I know that it is a popular career path for animal lovers! Some work in the field (such as by tracking animals and collecting samples), while others analyze data in labs or write reports that help wildlife protection policies. Wildlife biologists also help educate the public and do so much more. It’s a rewarding career for those who love animals and want to make a difference, but it does usually require a degree in wildlife biology or a related field. Salaries typically range from $45,000 to $85,000 per year, and jobs can be found in government agencies, research institutions, and conservation groups. 14. Zookeeper A zookeeper is someone who cares for animals in zoos, wildlife parks, and sanctuaries, making sure they are healthy, well-fed, and happy. Some of the things they do include preparing food, cleaning enclosures, monitoring animal behavior, and even assisting veterinarians with medical care. They also help educate visitors about wildlife conservation, which is a big part of protecting endangered species. It’s a physically demanding job that requires dedication and a deep love for animals, but it can also be very rewarding. Most zookeepers have a degree in zoology, biology, or animal science, and gain hands-on experience through internships or volunteer work. Salaries are usually around $30,000 to $50,000 per year, and while it’s not the highest-paying job, it’s a dream career for many animal lovers who want to make a real impact!
