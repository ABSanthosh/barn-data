  "text": "Executive Summary An advisory firm's website often serves as the hub for attracting new clients, with various forms of content acting as 'spokes' that attract prospective clients to the firm. But for many advisors, the hardest part of creating a content marketing strategy is knowing where to start. Without a structured approach, content creation can cost the advisor valuable time without leading to meaningful leads. In this guest post, Mikel Bruce, CEO of TinyFrog Technologies, discusses how financial advisory firms can leverage the AIDA (Awareness, Interest, Desire, Action) framework that outlines the stages of a prospect's decision-making process to create a clear, effective content marketing strategy. By aligning website content to the AIDA journey, firms can engage visitors in a way that encourages them along a sequential path toward becoming clients. This structured approach helps ensure that marketing efforts translate into measurable results rather than scattered content that fails to gain traction. Because very few consumers wake up one day with the sudden realization that they need a financial advisor (let alone know which advisor they want to use), firms can focus their efforts on guiding prospects through the decision process. The first step of the AIDA process, Awareness, centers on helping prospects recognize the firm's existence. This can be done through various forms of content – including blogs, videos, and/or podcast episodes – that address common pain points of the firm's ideal client. Additionally, firms can extend their content's reach by repurposing materials across different platforms (e.g., turning a blog post into a video that both explains a topic and showcases the advisor's personality). Once a prospect's attention has been captured, the next step is to build Interest by encouraging them to explore their problem in more depth. At this stage, prospects begin researching solutions and engaging with educational resources. Firms can support this engagement by offering high-value content (e.g., white papers or in-depth articles), while requesting the prospect's contact information in exchange. This allows firms to follow up with email sequences that introduce the firm, highlight key services, share relevant resources, and invite prospects to take the next step, such as scheduling a call. As prospects learn more about how the firm can address their specific concerns, they may begin to develop a stronger Desire to engage. At this stage, building trust is essential. Firms can showcase credibility by providing client testimonials, case studies, and success stories that illustrate how they have helped others achieve similar goals. Finally, at the Action stage, prospects are ready to decide whether to engage with the firm.  A well-structured process page on the firm's website can provide clarity on next steps, reinforce the value of working with the firm, and establish clear expectations for the advisor-client relationship. Additionally, a simple, compelling Call To Action (CTA) – such as a scheduling link, contact form, or direct phone number – helps guide prospects toward taking the final step. Ultimately, the key point is that a well-designed website, built with lead generation in mind, can be one of an advisory firm's most powerful tools for attracting and converting highly qualified prospects. The key lies in creating a thoughtful, targeted content strategy that meets prospects where they are – guiding them from initial Awareness to taking Action. And by doing so, firms can transform their website from a passive digital presence into an effective catalyst for long-term growth and success! Mikel Bruce is the CEO of TinyFrog Technologies, a San Diego web design agency specializing in WordPress web design \u0026 development and secured hosting \u0026 maintenance. Founded in 2003, TinyFrog Technologies offers a conversion-based approach to web design and has built over 1,100 websites. TinyFrog also has extensive experience in designing and building websites for financial advisors. Read more of Mikel’s articles here. Building a website that effectively attracts, engages, and persuades prospects to become clients requires a consistent content strategy. Such a strategy must meet the prospect's unique needs as they navigate through the four key stages of the AIDA decision-making process: Awareness, Interest, Desire, and Action. By understanding how an audience moves from the Awareness stage to the Action stage – and providing relevant resources every step of the way – firms can focus their resources, time, and energy on developing content that accomplishes a few critical goals. Ensuring that content is relevant allows firms to attract those who may fall within their ideal client avatar or target audience (particularly if it works with specific niches or industries) organically. It also helps build a genuine connection between advisors and their future clients by meeting prospects where they are today. And finally, it helps the most qualified prospects cross the finish line – transitioning from virtual strangers with a specific pain point into engaged and informed prospects ready to work with an advisor. The AIDA Process: Understanding The User Journey Of Prospective Clients While not unique to the financial services space, the AIDA process is an important marketing and advertising concept that growth-focused advisory firms can use to shape their content strategies. For advisors, AIDA represents the four stages that a prospective client moves through before engaging with the firm: Becoming aware of the firm's existence and services. Learning about services that might potentially benefit their unique circumstances. Feeling compelled to learn more about the firm to see if it will meet their needs. Committing to engage with the firm. This decision-making process plays a role in everything from a short social media post to an in-depth article, guiding prospects along the path from initial discovery to becoming full-fledged clients. Each step in this journey is part of the prospect's decision-making process and requires a distinct approach. For example, the content designed to spark Desire may not be appropriate for someone just starting to show interest in a firm. In fact, presenting more conversion-focused content too early can have the opposite effect – turning prospects away because they feel pressured before they're ready to engage. It's Time To Create A Gameplan Developing content strategy that addresses each of the four AIDA stages in the user journey can help firms attract and engage prospects more effectively. Not every example discussed below needs to be implemented for a firm to experience success. In fact, trying to do too much, all at once, can lead to burnout, frustration, and less engaging content. When it comes to effective content strategy intended to attract new clients, quality always outweighs quantity. Advisory firms experience the best results when two things occur – they focus on content they enjoy producing, and the topics and tone of that content resonate with their target audience. To reach visitors across different platforms and decision-making stages, firms can implement a sustainable and effective strategy that repurposes the same content across multiple formats. For example, a 1,000-word blog post can easily be transformed into ten social media posts, two emails, and one video script. This approach maximizes efficiency while maintaining consistency across channels. The biggest question for many firms is where to start. Rather than facing a blank slate, advisors can begin by doing a bit of research with current clients, peers, and social networks. Reflecting on recent client conversations and identifying frequently asked questions can reveal common pain points among the target audience – an excellent source of inspiration for a firm's content strategy. Additionally, reviewing content from thought leaders in the industry can offer valuable insights. By analyzing what works well, firms can find opportunities to provide unique perspectives and add their own voice to existing industry discussions. While it may take some trial and error to discover what resonates most with both the advisor and their audience, the key is to remain consistent and thoughtful in creating, scheduling, and sharing new content. Revamping A Traditional Content Marketing Strategy: The Hub And Spoke Model Consider how easily a simple online search can lead down a rabbit hole of related topics. A quick look at the best set of golf clubs for beginners might lead to articles on the best irons that will improve your game, the social benefits of joining a golf club, and so on. This experience reflects a popular content marketing strategy known as the hub and spoke model. Picture a bicycle wheel: The large hub is the central foundation, and the spokes are the supporting pieces that extend outward but that all lead back to the hub. Here's how the model applies to marketing content: The Hub. This is typically the broadest, most comprehensive content piece on a particular topic. For firms focusing on SEO, the hub is often a long-form article that includes essential keywords. For example, a good hub for a firm that targets new medical professionals might be about reducing medical school debt as a physician. The Spokes. These ancillary pieces address more targeted questions or subtopics related to the hub. For the firm whose hub piece examines reducing medical school debt, effective spokes might include blog or social media posts about balancing debt repayment with retirement savings or navigating student loan forgiveness for doctors. While the hub and spoke model is commonly used as an SEO strategy, there's an opportunity for financial advisory firms to amplify their impact using this approach more broadly. Instead of treating a single long-form piece as the hub, firms can consider their entire website as the hub. As for the spokes? These extend from content shared across various channels – email newsletters, YouTube videos, social media posts, guest articles, and podcast appearances. All of these marketing efforts are the spokes that constantly lead back to the website, encouraging visitors to engage further by exploring additional content, joining the email list, or scheduling a call. Ensuring That Content Resonates With Prospective Clients When creating website content to engage prospects, content should reflect the needs, concerns, and challenges of the firm's ideal client. It must be relevant, approachable, and easy to understand. Some advisors may feel inclined to showcase their technical expertise, diving into complex theories. However, this approach can alienate prospects who are not yet familiar with the nuances of financial planning. Overly technical content might even discourage potential clients from moving forward in the decision-making process. Creating content that resonates with non-financial professionals requires a shift in perspective. What may seem like common knowledge to an advisor could be unfamiliar territory for the average prospect. To ensure content is accessible, advisors might consider sharing it with friends or family members outside the financial industry, particularly those who reflect their target audience. Alternatively, partnering with a writer experienced in creating content for financial services can help ensure the message connects with the right audience. The following sections will discuss how firms can create engaging content that aligns with each stage of the AIDA framework, guiding prospects from initial Awareness to taking Action. Stage #1: Awareness People rarely wake up one day and decide, out of the blue, that they need a financial plan. More often, a specific catalyst sparks the prospect's journey. These catalysts can stem from personal concerns, or they may arise in response to recent life events. For example: A child receives a sizable inheritance from their parents. A couple decides to divorce, or someone unexpectedly loses a spouse. The stock market takes a nosedive, leaving a DIY investor worried about their portfolio's survival. A layoff forces someone into early retirement, cutting their runway to retirement short. A need has emerged, and the prospect realizes that working with a financial advisor may be the answer. But at this stage, their focus is on finding resources and information related to their situation. For advisory firms, the goal here is to generate brand awareness by producing content that educates, guides, and reassures prospects that a solution exists for their specific problem. This isn't the time to push services or flood inboxes or social media feeds. Instead, the focus should be on showcasing expertise and building a foundation of trust. Create Content That Matches The 'Spark' Identifying what draws a prospect to seek support in the first place can help firms create content that addresses their audience's most pressing concerns. By doing so, the firm becomes a trusted and reliable resource in the eyes of potential clients. Foundational, evergreen content that covers topics broadly (but intentionally) can attract a wide audience without becoming outdated quickly. This is important because prospects will naturally self-qualify throughout the AIDA process. Not everyone who enters the Awareness stage will progress to taking Action, but casting a wide, thoughtful net increases the likelihood of reaching the right audience when they're ready to move forward. Leveraging blogs, videos, or podcast episodes are all effective ways for firms to capture their prospects' attention at the Awareness stage. Blogs A blog post can be a valuable tool for advisory firms to answer the specific questions asked by their ideal clients. Long-form articles can also dive deeper into topics, offering comprehensive insights. However, a few key factors need to be in place to maximize the benefits of blogging. A firm must have someone with solid writing skills, along with the time and inclination to create and publish blog posts regularly. Alternatively, hiring a professional writer can help craft compelling blog content. While this comes with a cost, it still requires time for review and approval. Understanding the commitment involved in creating a successful blog is important. Whether the challenge lies in writing ability, time, creativity, or budget, acknowledging these factors upfront helps ensure the content strategy remains sustainable. A common question advisors have regarding blogs is: How long should a blog post be? While there's no one-size-fits-all answer, certain factors can influence this decision. For firms aiming to improve search engine rankings, long-form articles between 1,500 and 2,500 words tend to perform better, according to SEO expert Neil Patel. However, quality should always take precedence over word count. If a topic can be effectively covered in 1,000 words, there's no need to stuff it with fluff just to hit a target word count. On the other hand, the rise of short-form content platforms like TikTok and AI-generated summaries have conditioned audiences to expect quicker answers. Some readers may prefer succinct, straight-to-the-point blog posts. Regardless of the length, blog posts and articles should be easy for the viewer to read or scan quickly. Key strategies include: Using headers of varying sizes (e.g., H1s, H2s, H3s); Avoiding industry jargon; Including images or videos when possible; Using bullet points and lists to break up text; Adding clear calls to action for readers ready to take the next step; and Linking to other relevant resources. For inspiration, consider one of our clients, Beyond Your Hammock, an advisory firm that consistently publishes comprehensive, easy-to-follow blog articles relevant to its target audience. For example, their post \"How to Make a Financial Plan That Adapts to Your Dynamic Life\" is a 2,000+ word article that remains highly readable thanks to effective formatting – headers, lists, bold and italicized text, embedded links, and a clear call to action at the end. Videos For firms less inclined toward writing, video content offers a powerful alternative. A recent Wyzowl study on Video Marketing found that 83% of consumers want to see more videos from brands, and 93% of marketers say video marketing has given them a good ROI (engagement, views, leads, brand awareness). Video content allows firms to cover the same topics they might address in a blog, while also making complex ideas easier to explain. Videos also showcase an advisor's personality, helping prospects visualize what working with the firm might look and feel like. Perhaps the most compelling reason to consider including video content is that viewers tend to retain information much better than with text-based content. People are naturally drawn to visual storytelling, and seeing an advisor on screen can create a stronger connection than reading an article. While video production does require time and effort, it doesn't demand a professional studio setup. Many advisors find success with simple, polished videos created with basic equipment. Key steps for a successful project include creating a clear script or preparing thoughtful talking points and making sure the final product looks both professional and visually appealing. According to the Wyzowl study mentioned above, marketers have found that videos between 30 and 60 seconds perform the best, with 1- to 2-minute videos following closely behind. An excellent example of video content in action comes from another client of ours, Wrenne Financial Planning, an advisory firm that incorporates videos across its website. These include not only introductions of their team members and advisors, but also powerful client testimonials. Hearing directly from clients whose lives have been positively impacted can certainly influence prospects in the Awareness stage. Podcast Episodes Podcasts offer another avenue for advisory firms to reach a wider audience and establish themselves as thought leaders in the industry. With podcasts available on nearly every topic imaginable, advisors can strategically position themselves in front of their target audience. For example, firms working with founders and entrepreneurs might seek guest opportunities on business-focused podcasts. Those serving physicians or medical professionals could look for podcasts that cater to healthcare audiences. The key is to pursue relevant opportunities that directly connect with desired prospects. For firms that prefer to take full control of the process – and you have the time and resources to do so – starting a podcast can be an excellent strategy. According to Edison Research, 47% of the population age 12 and up listens to podcasts monthly, and 46% of weekly listeners have purchased a service or product as a result of podcast content. Similar to blogs, consistency and quality are critical for building a podcast audience. Regular publishing, a structured format, and content that addresses the target audience's pain points help differentiate a podcast from the thousands of others available. The team at Wrenne Financial Planning does a great job at publishing and promoting their own podcast, Finance for Physicians. By focusing on a highly specific audience while keeping topics broad enough to appeal to physicians interested in personal finance, they've successfully positioned themselves as a go-to resource. When prospects in this niche are ready to engage, they'll know exactly who to call first. This podcast releases new episodes weekly, a commitment that requires quite a bit of time and planning. Not all advisors may have the capacity to maintain such a schedule, especially as they scale and grow. In these cases, outsourcing podcast production can make this more manageable. Stage #2: Interest After a prospect's attention has been captured, their next step isn't always to immediately book a call – though that can happen sometimes. More often, prospects move into the Interest stage of the AIDA decision-making process. At this point, they begin researching their problem in more depth, ideally by engaging with content a firm has already shared. As prospects become more aware of their challenges, they start to recognize the value of outsourcing their financial management to a professional. From a content perspective, this stage is about continuing to capture attention while positioning the firm as a relevant and valuable option for a financial partnership. This is also the time to get a little bolder with calls to action. Firms can offer high-value resources in exchange for a prospect's email address or phone number. Since credibility and trust have already been established, prospects in this phase are more likely to share their contact information in exchange for additional guidance and insights. White Papers Or Long-Form Articles In the Interest stage, prospects may be more inclined to engage with in-depth, long-form content, such as white papers. These detailed resources allow advisory firms to share compelling stories, showcase expertise, and illustrate how their services directly address client problems. Firms might consider using white papers to share case studies based on current or hypothetical clients, provide comprehensive guides on specific pain points (e.g., the tax treatment of incentive stock options), or create step-by-step how-to guides – just to name a few ideas. For firms already creating blog content, several related posts can be combined into a more comprehensive ebook. This approach aligns with the hub and spoke model, where existing content serves as the foundation for more robust, valuable materials. Incentive-Based Opt-Ins Lead magnets are a powerful tool for collecting information from prospective clients. The more targeted the lead magnet, the more qualified the leads will be. For example, consider the difference between two lead magnets. One is called \"Your Retirement Planning Checklist\", and the other is \"A Physician's Checklist for Transitioning Out of Your Private Practice.\" While both offer value, the first is general (really general). It doesn't speak directly to any target audience. The second checklist speaks directly to a specific audience, making it more effective at attracting qualified leads. Yes, it may be less relevant to a larger number of people. But at the Interest stage in the AIDA framework, content should connect with target audience members who have already shown an interest in the firm and are ready to learn more. For example, Ellis Retirement Services markets a lead magnet designed to address a specific pain point: helping small businesses increase employee participation in their 401(k) plans. To access the checklist (which they've kept short and to the point), prospects must provide their contact information. This allows the Ellis team to follow up with additional resources and guidance, moving prospects further along in the decision-making process. Newsletters And Email Blasts Email newsletters remain one of the most effective content marketing tools, particularly when communications are tailored to speak directly to a firm's target audiences. Prospects who join an email list typically demonstrate a strong intent to engage, having already shared their contact information. And though they may not be ready to become a client yet, they are open to receiving ongoing, high-value resources, check-ins, and updates. Like other forms of content, email newsletters should be strategic and well-executed. Many firms start with a 'welcome sequence' – a series of five to seven emails that introduce the firm, explain its services, share top resources, and encourage subscribers to reach out or schedule a call. From there, firms can determine a realistic cadence for ongoing communication. Most businesses send between one and four emails per month – frequent enough to stay top of mind without overwhelming subscribers' inboxes. It's also important to consider how readers engage with email. According to a Forbes report on 2024 email marketing statistics, 61% of consumers spend more than eight seconds viewing an email, while 23.5% spend between two and eight seconds. This means emails should be compelling, relevant, and easy to scan. Prospects will decide in just a few seconds whether to keep reading or move on. Even if subscribers don't read every email, simply seeing the firm's name in their inbox helps maintain top-of-mind awareness – an invaluable asset when they're ready to take the next step. Stage #3: Desire Once prospects have learned more about a firm's services and capabilities – and how those services may address their specific concerns – they may feel more compelled to connect. By this stage, the firm has positioned itself as a thought leader and trusted resource. Now, the focus shifts to content that builds on that foundation of trust, encouraging prospects to take the next step toward becoming a client. Content in the Desire stage is all about trust-building, showcasing how the firm has helped others achieve outcomes similar to what prospects are seeking. Similar to reviews and testimonials, social proof demonstrates a firm's accomplishments through the eyes of other people. It's an effective way to build greater trust—especially since you aren't asking the prospect to simply take your word for it. Prospects want to see evidence of success, and social proof shows how others have had positive experiences with the firm. Social proof can come in several different forms, including reviews, testimonials, awards, statistics, strategic partnerships, and media mentions. If the firm or its advisors have won industry awards, these should be prominently displayed on the home page of the firm's website. Similarly, if the firm has strategic partnerships with other professionals (like accountants, attorneys, or real estate agents), brief mentions of these collaborators can reassure prospects that other professionals trust the firm's guidance and services enough to work together. If advisors have contributed content to industry publications, appeared on podcasts, or served as an expert or correspondent for a broadcast company, these activities can be mentioned as well. For example, Wealthkeel incorporates social proof on their home page, showcasing accomplishments like 10 Young Advisors to Watch in the Country. Achievements like these speak to an advisor's commitment to excellence and client care – signals that can resonate with prospects looking for trustworthy guidance. Social proof doesn't need to be limited to a firm's website; it can be incorporated into newsletters, social media posts, and blogs. However, it's important to strike a balance – too much social proof in one place can come across as boastful rather than credible. The goal is to reinforce a strong reputation without overwhelming the audience. Client Testimonials And Reviews Testimonials are a particularly powerful form of social proof and have become a critical part of the decision-making process across industries – from choosing a restaurant to purchasing a product online. In the financial services space, the SEC's updated marketing rule now allows advisors to incorporate reviews, testimonials, and endorsements into their marketing strategies (with proper disclosures and compliance procedures in place). While some firms have been slow to adopt these practices, leveraging testimonials can significantly enhance credibility and trust. Showcasing ratings and client feedback allows prospects to hear directly from those who have benefited from the firm's services. Medicus Wealth Planning offers a clear example of this strategy, featuring testimonials directly on the home page of its website. This allows site visitors to quickly learn about the experiences of existing clients, helping to establish trust and quell concerns early in the decision-making process. Case Studies Case studies are particularly effective for helping prospects envision themselves as clients. By illustrating how the firm has supported others in similar situations, case studies provide a clear, relatable picture of the value an advisor brings Firms can incorporate multiple case studies on their website, each tailored to different target audiences and specific pain points. Whether based on real client experiences or hypothetical events, the emphasis should be on how the firm's services helped overcome challenges and achieve desired outcomes. Panoramic Financial, for example, works with physicians at various stages of their careers and features three distinct case studies reflecting common life phases: reaching the peak of their careers, growing their families, and transitioning into new roles as attending physicians. Each case study is detailed enough to provide a comprehensive view of how, exactly, Panoramic's services made a difference. In each case study, they present: Background information about the client The key questions or challenges the client faced Panoramic's three-step approach to addressing those challenges The results achieved By positioning the firm as a trusted guide and highlighting key differentiators, case studies help firms stand out from other advisors that prospects may be considering. Stage #4: Action At the Action stage, prospects are ready to take the next step. They feel confident in the firm's expertise and believe in the value it can deliver to their financial lives. So confident, in fact, that they're prepared to engage further or start the process of becoming a client. All of the previous content up to this point has played an important role in creating brand awareness, showcasing experience, and establishing trust. Now, the focus shifts to guiding prospects toward taking action. Content at this stage is less about education and more about persuasion – encouraging prospects to take that final leap. To minimize hesitation, it's important to eliminate any uncertainty about what working with the firm will look like. A clear, compelling process page can be one of the most effective tools for converting prospects into clients. This page should accomplish the following: Establish expectations of your advisor-client relationship; Help readers self-identify as an ideal fit for your firm; Reinforce the unique benefits of working with the firm; and Provide practical information about the next steps after scheduling a call. Stinnet Wealth Planning, for example, provides a clear, easy-to-follow process page that demystifies the steps involved in becoming a client. While it may not seem like traditional content (like a blog or video), a process page can, in fact, be one of the most important elements on a firm's website for moving prospects across the finish line. Calls To Action (CTAs) And Calendar Schedules A Call To Action (CTA) is a prompt that encourages a prospect to take the next step, whether that's calling the office, sending a message, or scheduling a meeting. CTAs should always be simple, straightforward, and enticing. This isn't the time to get ultra-creative with complex wording. The goal is to reduce friction and make it as easy as possible for prospects to follow through. For example, if the objective is to book a call, a straightforward CTA like \"Book a Call\" is often the most effective. While it's possible to test out different phrases and see if something resonates more with your audience (perhaps swapping out \"Book a Call\" with \"Schedule an Introductory Meeting\"), the language should remain clear enough that prospects immediately understand what action is being requested. Paradigm Wealth Partners provides a great example of this approach by including a \"Schedule a Consultation\" button in the top right corner of every page on its website. This clear, consistent CTA ensures that prospects know exactly what they're doing when they click the button. Once clicked, the button leads directly to the firm's scheduling software, allowing prospects to book a call within seconds. Implementing scheduling software, if feasible, is highly recommended. Not only does it keep visitors on the firm's website, it also enables them to take action immediately and reduces the back-and-forth of trying to find a suitable meeting time. Contact Forms Again, reducing friction is key in the Action stage. A contact form on the firm's website offers an easy and quick way for prospects to get in touch as soon as they're ready to act. While other methods of contact (such as a phone number or email address) should still be provided, a contact form simplifies the process. Even seemingly minor steps – like opening an email app, copying an address, and composing a message – can introduce unnecessary friction. Plus, requiring a prospect to leave the website increases the risk of distractions or mistakes, like a mistyped email address. Having a well-placed contact form eliminates these risks and encourages immediate engagement. When designing a contact form, it's best to keep it as simple as possible. Only request the information necessary to respond to their submission – additional details can be gathered during the initial conversation. Overly complicated with too many required fields can be off-putting, potentially causing prospects to abandon the process altogether. A well-designed website, built with lead generation in mind, can become one of the most powerful tools an advisory firm has for attracting and converting highly qualified prospects. The key lies in creating thoughtful, targeted content that connects with the intended audience at every stage of the decision-making process. By developing a content strategy that meets prospects where they are – from initial Awareness to taking Action – firms can build a dynamic library of resources that works continuously in the background. This approach not only nurtures relationships but also drives growth without requiring constant time or energy. Ultimately, the power of a thoughtful content strategy lies in its ability to foster meaningful connections, build trust, and inspire prospects to take the next step. When done right, it transforms a website from a simple digital presence into a catalyst for long-term growth and success! Quality? Nerdy? Relevant?

But for many advisors, the hardest part of creating a content marketing strategy is knowing where to start. Without a structured approach, content creation can cost the advisor valuable time without leading to meaningful leads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this guest post, Mikel Bruce, CEO of TinyFrog Technologies, discusses how financial advisory firms can leverage the AIDA (Awareness, Interest, Desire, Action) framework that outlines the stages of a prospect\u0026#39;s decision-making process to create a clear, effective content marketing strategy. By aligning website content to the AIDA journey, firms can engage visitors in a way that encourages them along a sequential path toward becoming clients. This structured approach helps ensure that marketing efforts translate into measurable results rather than scattered content that fails to gain traction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause very few consumers wake up one day with the sudden realization that they need a financial advisor (let alone know which advisor they want to use), firms can focus their efforts on guiding prospects through the decision process. The first step of the AIDA process, Awareness, centers on helping prospects recognize the firm\u0026#39;s existence. This can be done through various forms of content – including blogs, videos, and/or podcast episodes – that address common pain points of the firm\u0026#39;s ideal client. Additionally, firms can extend their content\u0026#39;s reach by repurposing materials across different platforms (e.g., turning a blog post into a video that both explains a topic and showcases the advisor\u0026#39;s personality).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce a prospect\u0026#39;s attention has been captured, the next step is to build Interest by encouraging them to explore their problem in more depth. At this stage, prospects begin researching solutions and engaging with educational resources. Firms can support this engagement by offering high-value content (e.g., white papers or in-depth articles), while requesting the prospect\u0026#39;s contact information in exchange. This allows firms to follow up with email sequences that introduce the firm, highlight key services, share relevant resources, and invite prospects to take the next step, such as scheduling a call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs prospects learn more about how the firm can address their specific concerns, they may begin to develop a stronger Desire to engage. At this stage, building trust is essential. Firms can showcase credibility by providing client testimonials, case studies, and success stories that illustrate how they have helped others achieve similar goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, at the Action stage, prospects are ready to decide whether to engage with the firm.  A well-structured process page on the firm\u0026#39;s website can provide clarity on next steps, reinforce the value of working with the firm, and establish clear expectations for the advisor-client relationship. Additionally, a simple, compelling Call To Action (CTA) – such as a scheduling link, contact form, or direct phone number – helps guide prospects toward taking the final step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, the key point is that a well-designed website, built with lead generation in mind, can be one of an advisory firm\u0026#39;s most powerful tools for attracting and converting highly qualified prospects. The key lies in creating a thoughtful, targeted content strategy that meets prospects where they are – guiding them from initial Awareness to taking Action. And by doing so, firms can transform their website from a passive digital presence into an effective catalyst for long-term growth and success!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mikel-Headshot-002-200x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mikel-Headshot-002-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mikel-Headshot-002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mikel-Headshot-002.jpg 255w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-src=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mikel-Headshot-002-200x200.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mikel-Headshot-002-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mikel-Headshot-002-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mikel-Headshot-002.jpg 255w\" data-old-src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMikel Bruce is the CEO of \u003ca href=\"https://tinyfrog4advisors.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eTinyFrog Technologies\u003c/a\u003e, a San Diego web design agency specializing in WordPress web design \u0026amp; development and secured hosting \u0026amp; maintenance.

Such a strategy must meet the prospect\u0026#39;s unique needs as they navigate through the four key stages of the AIDA decision-making process: Awareness, Interest, Desire, and Action. By understanding how an audience moves from the Awareness stage to the Action stage – and providing relevant resources every step of the way – firms can focus their resources, time, and energy on developing content that accomplishes a few critical goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnsuring that content is relevant allows firms to attract those who may fall within their ideal client avatar or target audience (particularly if it works with specific niches or industries) organically. It also helps build a genuine connection between advisors and their future clients by meeting prospects where they are today. And finally, it helps the most qualified prospects cross the finish line – transitioning from virtual strangers with a specific pain point into engaged and informed prospects ready to work with an advisor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-nav-title=\"AIDA Process: Understanding User Journe\" id=\"the-aida-process-understanding-the-user-journey-of-prospective-clients\"\u003eThe AIDA Process: Understanding The User Journey Of Prospective Clients\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile not unique to the financial services space, the AIDA process is an important marketing and advertising concept that growth-focused advisory firms can use to shape their content strategies. For advisors, AIDA represents the four stages that a prospective client moves through before engaging with the firm:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBecoming aware of the firm\u0026#39;s existence and services.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLearning about services that might potentially benefit their unique circumstances.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFeeling compelled to learn more about the firm to see if it will meet their needs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCommitting to engage with the firm.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis decision-making process plays a role in everything from a short social media post to an in-depth article, guiding prospects along the path from initial discovery to becoming full-fledged clients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach step in this journey is part of the prospect\u0026#39;s decision-making process and requires a distinct approach. For example, the content designed to spark Desire may not be appropriate for someone just starting to show interest in a firm. In fact, presenting more conversion-focused content too early can have the opposite effect – turning prospects away because they feel pressured before they\u0026#39;re ready to engage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"its-time-to-create-a-gameplan\"\u003eIt\u0026#39;s Time To Create A Gameplan\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeveloping content strategy that addresses each of the four AIDA stages in the user journey can help firms attract and engage prospects more effectively. Not every example discussed below needs to be implemented for a firm to experience success. In fact, trying to do too much, all at once, can lead to burnout, frustration, and less engaging content. When it comes to effective content strategy intended to attract new clients, quality always outweighs quantity. Advisory firms experience the best results when two things occur – they focus on content they enjoy producing, and the topics and tone of that content resonate with their target audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo reach visitors across different platforms and decision-making stages, firms can implement a sustainable and effective strategy that repurposes the same content across multiple formats. For example, a 1,000-word blog post can easily be transformed into ten social media posts, two emails, and one video script. This approach maximizes efficiency while maintaining consistency across channels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe biggest question for many firms is where to start. Rather than facing a blank slate, advisors can begin by doing a bit of research with current clients, peers, and social networks. Reflecting on recent client conversations and identifying frequently asked questions can reveal common pain points among the target audience – an excellent source of inspiration for a firm\u0026#39;s content strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, reviewing content from thought leaders in the industry can offer valuable insights. By analyzing what works well, firms can find opportunities to provide unique perspectives and add their own voice to existing industry discussions. While it may take some trial and error to discover what resonates most with both the advisor and their audience, the key is to remain consistent and thoughtful in creating, scheduling, and sharing new content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 data-nav-title=\"Revamping Traditional Content Marketing\" id=\"revamping-a-traditional-content-marketing-strategy-the-hub-and-spoke-model\"\u003eRevamping A Traditional Content Marketing Strategy: The Hub And Spoke Model\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsider how easily a simple online search can lead down a rabbit hole of related topics. A quick look at the best set of golf clubs for beginners might lead to articles on the best irons that will improve your game, the social benefits of joining a golf club, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis experience reflects a popular content marketing strategy known as the hub and spoke model. Picture a bicycle wheel: The large hub is the central foundation, and the spokes are the supporting pieces that extend outward but that all lead back to the hub. Here\u0026#39;s how the model applies to marketing content:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Hub. \u003c/strong\u003eThis is typically the broadest, most comprehensive content piece on a particular topic. For firms focusing on SEO, the hub is often a long-form article that includes essential keywords. For example, a good hub for a firm that targets new medical professionals might be about \u003cem\u003ereducing medical school debt as a physician\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Spokes.\u003c/strong\u003e These ancillary pieces address more targeted questions or subtopics related to the hub. For the firm whose hub piece examines reducing medical school debt, effective spokes might include blog or social media posts about \u003cem\u003ebalancing debt repayment with retirement savings\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003enavigating student loan forgiveness for doctors\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the hub and spoke model is commonly used as an SEO strategy, there\u0026#39;s an opportunity for financial advisory firms to amplify their impact using this approach more broadly. Instead of treating a single long-form piece as the hub, firms can consider their \u003cem\u003eentire\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003ewebsite\u003c/em\u003e as the hub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the spokes? These extend from content shared across various channels – email newsletters, YouTube videos, social media posts, guest articles, and podcast appearances. All of these marketing efforts are the spokes that constantly lead back to the website, encouraging visitors to engage further by exploring additional content, joining the email list, or scheduling a call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 data-nav-title=\"Ensuring That Content Resonates\" id=\"ensuring-that-content-resonates-with-prospective-clients\"\u003eEnsuring That Content Resonates With Prospective Clients\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen creating website content to engage prospects, content should reflect the needs, concerns, and challenges of the firm\u0026#39;s ideal client. It must be relevant, approachable, and easy to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome advisors may feel inclined to showcase their technical expertise, diving into complex theories. However, this approach can alienate prospects who are not yet familiar with the nuances of financial planning. Overly technical content might even discourage potential clients from moving forward in the decision-making process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreating content that resonates with non-financial professionals requires a shift in perspective. What may seem like common knowledge to an advisor could be unfamiliar territory for the average prospect. To ensure content is accessible, advisors might consider sharing it with friends or family members outside the financial industry, particularly those who reflect their target audience. Alternatively, partnering with a writer experienced in creating content for financial services can help ensure the message connects with the right audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following sections will discuss how firms can create engaging content that aligns with each stage of the AIDA framework, guiding prospects from initial Awareness to taking Action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"stage-1-awareness\"\u003eStage #1: Awareness\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople rarely wake up one day and decide, out of the blue, that they need a financial plan. More often, a specific catalyst sparks the prospect\u0026#39;s journey. These catalysts can stem from personal concerns, or they may arise in response to recent life events. For example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA child receives a sizable inheritance from their parents.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA couple decides to divorce, or someone unexpectedly loses a spouse.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe stock market takes a nosedive, leaving a DIY investor worried about their portfolio\u0026#39;s survival.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA layoff forces someone into early retirement, cutting their runway to retirement short.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA need has emerged, and the prospect realizes that working with a financial advisor may be the answer. But at this stage, their focus is on finding resources and information related to their situation. For advisory firms, the goal here is to generate brand awareness by producing content that educates, guides, and reassures prospects that a solution exists for their specific problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn\u0026#39;t the time to push services or flood inboxes or social media feeds. Instead, the focus should be on showcasing expertise and building a foundation of trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"create-content-that-matches-the-spark\"\u003eCreate Content That Matches The \u0026#39;Spark\u0026#39;\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdentifying what draws a prospect to seek support in the first place can help firms create content that addresses their audience\u0026#39;s most pressing concerns. By doing so, the firm becomes a trusted and reliable resource in the eyes of potential clients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFoundational, evergreen content that covers topics broadly (but intentionally) can attract a wide audience without becoming outdated quickly. This is important because prospects will naturally self-qualify throughout the AIDA process. Not everyone who enters the Awareness stage will progress to taking Action, but casting a wide, thoughtful net increases the likelihood of reaching the right audience when they\u0026#39;re ready to move forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeveraging blogs, videos, or podcast episodes are all effective ways for firms to capture their prospects\u0026#39; attention at the Awareness stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"blogs\"\u003eBlogs\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blog post can be a valuable tool for advisory firms to answer the specific questions asked by their ideal clients. Long-form articles can also dive deeper into topics, offering comprehensive insights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, a few key factors need to be in place to maximize the benefits of blogging. A firm must have someone with solid writing skills, along with the time and inclination to create and publish blog posts regularly. Alternatively, hiring a professional writer can help craft compelling blog content. While this comes with a cost, it still requires time for review and approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding the commitment involved in creating a successful blog is important. Whether the challenge lies in writing ability, time, creativity, or budget, acknowledging these factors upfront helps ensure the content strategy remains sustainable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA common question advisors have regarding blogs is: How long should a blog post be? While there\u0026#39;s no one-size-fits-all answer, certain factors can influence this decision. For firms aiming to improve search engine rankings, long-form articles between 1,500 and 2,500 words tend to perform better, according to SEO expert \u003ca href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/long-blog-articles/\"\u003eNeil Patel\u003c/a\u003e. However, quality should always take precedence over word count. If a topic can be effectively covered in 1,000 words, there\u0026#39;s no need to stuff it with fluff just to hit a target word count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, the rise of short-form content platforms like TikTok and AI-generated summaries have conditioned audiences to expect quicker answers. Some readers may prefer succinct, straight-to-the-point blog posts. Regardless of the length, blog posts and articles should be easy for the viewer to read or scan quickly. Key strategies include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUsing headers of varying sizes (e.g., H1s, H2s, H3s);\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAvoiding industry jargon;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIncluding images or videos when possible;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUsing bullet points and lists to break up text;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdding clear calls to action for readers ready to take the next step; and\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLinking to other relevant resources.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor inspiration, consider one of our clients, \u003ca href=\"https://beyondyourhammock.com\"\u003eBeyond Your Hammock\u003c/a\u003e, an advisory firm that consistently publishes comprehensive, easy-to-follow blog articles relevant to its target audience.

Videos also showcase an advisor\u0026#39;s personality, helping prospects visualize what working with the firm might look and feel like. Perhaps the most compelling reason to consider including video content is that viewers tend to retain information much better than with text-based content.

With podcasts available on nearly every topic imaginable, advisors can strategically position themselves in front of their target audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, firms working with founders and entrepreneurs might seek guest opportunities on business-focused podcasts.

More often, prospects move into the Interest stage of the AIDA decision-making process. At this point, they begin researching their problem in more depth, ideally by engaging with content a firm has already shared. As prospects become more aware of their challenges, they start to recognize the value of outsourcing their financial management to a professional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a content perspective, this stage is about continuing to capture attention while positioning the firm as a relevant and valuable option for a financial partnership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is also the time to get a little bolder with calls to action. Firms can offer high-value resources in exchange for a prospect\u0026#39;s email address or phone number. Since credibility and trust have already been established, prospects in this phase are more likely to share their contact information in exchange for additional guidance and insights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"white-papers-or-longform-articles\"\u003eWhite Papers Or Long-Form Articles\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Interest stage, prospects may be more inclined to engage with in-depth, long-form content, such as white papers. These detailed resources allow advisory firms to share compelling stories, showcase expertise, and illustrate how their services directly address client problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirms might consider using white papers to share case studies based on current or hypothetical clients, provide comprehensive guides on specific pain points (e.g., the tax treatment of incentive stock options), or create step-by-step how-to guides – just to name a few ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor firms already creating blog content, several related posts can be combined into a more comprehensive ebook. This approach aligns with the hub and spoke model, where existing content serves as the foundation for more robust, valuable materials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"incentivebased-optins\"\u003eIncentive-Based Opt-Ins\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLead magnets are a powerful tool for collecting information from prospective clients. The more targeted the lead magnet, the more qualified the leads will be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, consider the difference between two lead magnets. One is called \u0026#34;Your Retirement Planning Checklist\u0026#34;, and the other is \u0026#34;A Physician\u0026#39;s Checklist for Transitioning Out of Your Private Practice.\u0026#34; While both offer value, the first is general (\u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e general). It doesn\u0026#39;t speak directly to any target audience. The second checklist speaks directly to a specific audience, making it more effective at attracting qualified leads. Yes, it may be less relevant to a larger number of people. But at the Interest stage in the AIDA framework, content should connect with target audience members who have already shown an interest in the firm and are ready to learn more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, Ellis Retirement Services markets a lead magnet designed to address a specific pain point: helping small businesses increase employee participation in their 401(k) plans. To access the checklist (which they\u0026#39;ve kept short and to the point), prospects must provide their contact information. This allows the Ellis team to follow up with additional resources and guidance, moving prospects further along in the decision-making process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04-Ellis-Retirement-Service.png\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" title=\"Ellis Retirement Service\" src=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04-Ellis-Retirement-Service.png\" alt=\"Ellis Retirement Service\" width=\"3135\" height=\"1736\" srcset=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04-Ellis-Retirement-Service.png 3135w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04-Ellis-Retirement-Service-300x166.png 300w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04-Ellis-Retirement-Service-1024x567.png 1024w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04-Ellis-Retirement-Service-768x425.png 768w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04-Ellis-Retirement-Service-1536x851.png 1536w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04-Ellis-Retirement-Service-2048x1134.png 2048w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04-Ellis-Retirement-Service-2000x1107.png 2000w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 3135px) 100vw, 3135px\" data-src=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04-Ellis-Retirement-Service.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04-Ellis-Retirement-Service.png 3135w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04-Ellis-Retirement-Service-300x166.png 300w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04-Ellis-Retirement-Service-1024x567.png 1024w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04-Ellis-Retirement-Service-768x425.png 768w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04-Ellis-Retirement-Service-1536x851.png 1536w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04-Ellis-Retirement-Service-2048x1134.png 2048w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04-Ellis-Retirement-Service-2000x1107.png 2000w\" data-old-src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"newsletters-and-email-blasts\"\u003eNewsletters And Email Blasts\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmail newsletters remain one of the most effective content marketing tools, particularly when communications are tailored to speak directly to a firm\u0026#39;s target audiences. Prospects who join an email list typically demonstrate a strong intent to engage, having already shared their contact information. And though they may not be ready to become a client yet, they are open to receiving ongoing, high-value resources, check-ins, and updates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike other forms of content, email newsletters should be strategic and well-executed. Many firms start with a \u0026#39;welcome sequence\u0026#39; – a series of five to seven emails that introduce the firm, explain its services, share top resources, and encourage subscribers to reach out or schedule a call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom there, firms can determine a realistic cadence for ongoing communication. Most businesses send between one and four emails per month – frequent enough to stay top of mind without overwhelming subscribers\u0026#39; inboxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s also important to consider how readers engage with email. According to a \u003ca href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/email-marketing-statistics/\"\u003eForbes\u003c/a\u003e report on 2024 email marketing statistics, 61% of consumers spend more than eight seconds viewing an email, while 23.5% spend between two and eight seconds.

By this stage, the firm has positioned itself as a thought leader and trusted resource. Now, the focus shifts to content that builds on that foundation of trust, encouraging prospects to take the next step toward becoming a client.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContent in the Desire stage is all about trust-building, showcasing how the firm has helped others achieve outcomes similar to what prospects are seeking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSimilar to reviews and testimonials, \u003ca href=\"https://tinyfrog.com/what-is-social-proof-and-how-can-you-use-it/\"\u003esocial proof\u003c/a\u003e demonstrates a firm\u0026#39;s accomplishments through the eyes of other people. It\u0026#39;s an effective way to build greater trust—especially since you aren\u0026#39;t asking the prospect to simply take your word for it. Prospects want to see evidence of success, and social proof shows how others have had positive experiences with the firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSocial proof can come in several different forms, including reviews, testimonials, awards, statistics, strategic partnerships, and media mentions. If the firm or its advisors have won industry awards, these should be prominently displayed on the home page of the firm\u0026#39;s website. Similarly, if the firm has strategic partnerships with other professionals (like accountants, attorneys, or real estate agents), brief mentions of these collaborators can reassure prospects that other professionals trust the firm\u0026#39;s guidance and services enough to work together. If advisors have contributed content to industry publications, appeared on podcasts, or served as an expert or correspondent for a broadcast company, these activities can be mentioned as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, \u003ca href=\"https://wealthkeel.com/\"\u003eWealthkeel\u003c/a\u003e incorporates social proof on their home page, showcasing accomplishments like \u003cem\u003e10 Young Advisors to Watch in the Country\u003c/em\u003e.
