Working from home with kids can be tough. It’s like trying to juggle while riding a unicycle. You want to do your job well, but you also need to take care of your children. It’s a balancing act that many parents face today. I have a toddler and I also earn money from home, so I completely understand how hard it can feel to work and take care of a child. Working from home with a 2-year-old is always an adventure. Between work tasks and toddler chaos, I’ve learned the importance of flexibility and finding balance. It’s not always easy, but with a bit of patience and creativity, I make it work! Best Ways To Work From Home With Kids Below are the best ways to work from home with kids. Recommended reading: 32 Best Stay At Home Jobs For Moms \u0026 Dads (Great, Flexible Ideas!) 1. Have realistic expectations Working from home without childcare can be tough. It’s important to set realistic goals for what you can accomplish each day. Remember that you’re juggling two big jobs at once – your paid work and taking care of your children. It’s okay if things don’t go perfectly. Here are some things to remember: Try to be flexible with your schedule. Some days you might get a lot done, while other days may be more challenging. Don’t expect to work uninterrupted for long stretches. Kids usually need attention, snacks, or help with activities. Plan for shorter work sessions throughout the day. This can help you stay productive while still being there for your kids. It’s normal to feel stressed sometimes. Cut yourself some slack and celebrate the small wins each day. Set up a routine, but be ready to change it when needed. Kids’ needs can be unpredictable, so stay open to adjusting your plans. One thing to remember is that this situation is temporary. As your kids grow or childcare options change, your work-from-home experience will too. 2. Set up a dedicated workspace Having a specific area for work is super important when you’re at home with kids. I recommend that you find a spot that’s just for you and your job tasks. Here are more tips for setting up a home office (and no, you don’t need a whole room if you don’t have the space!): Try to pick a place away from where your kids play. This can be a spare room, a corner of your bedroom, or even a closet if you’re short on space. Make sure your workspace has good lighting. Natural light is great, but a desk lamp works too (especially if you’re in a dark corner or a closet). A wraparound desk where you can fit everything on it is helpful, like this one. Comfy seating is a must – your back will thank you! Keep your work stuff organized. Use folders, boxes, or shelves to store papers and supplies. This way, you won’t waste time looking for things. If possible, use a door or screen to separate your workspace. This helps create a boundary between work and home life. Your workspace doesn’t have to be perfect. The key is having a spot where you can focus on work while your kids are busy elsewhere. 3. Create a daily schedule Making a daily work schedule can help you balance work and family life. You may want to block out specific times for work, meals, and family activities. Try to match your work hours with your kids’ school or nap times if possible. This way, you can focus on work when they’re busy too. Include breaks in your schedule for snacks, playtime, and quick chores. These short breaks can help you recharge and stay on top of household tasks. If you have the budget, then you may want to look into hiring outside help, such as a twice-a-month house cleaner. Be flexible with your schedule too. Some days might not go as planned (you are watching your kids, so this is normal!), and that’s okay. Having a basic outline helps, but don’t stress if you need to adjust things. By creating a daily schedule, you’ll find it easier to manage your time and keep both work and family life running smoothly. 4. Plan outdoor breaks Taking outdoor breaks is important when you work from home with kids. It gives everyone a chance to get fresh air and move around. You can plan short breaks throughout the day. Try going for a quick walk around the block or playing in the backyard for 15 minutes. These breaks help kids burn energy and give you a mental refresh. You might take a break after lunch or when you finish a big task. Outdoor breaks work well in all seasons. In winter, build a snowman. In summer, have a picnic lunch in the yard. Taking outdoor breaks has been a lifesaver for both my toddler and me when working from home. We’ll head outside for a quick walk around the neighborhood or just play in the yard for a little bit. It helps her burn off some energy and I get a mental refresh, making it easier to dive back into work afterward. No matter the season, I’ve found that these little outdoor breaks make a big difference in keeping us both happy and productive. Plus, it’s a great way to break up the day with some fresh air and movement! 5. Prepare easy snacks ahead Working from home with kids means you need quick and easy food options. Planning snacks ahead of time can save you lots of stress. Here are some ideas for snacks for you or your children: Try making a big batch of granola bars or energy bites on the weekend. These can last all week and are great for both kids and adults. Cut up fruits and veggies and store them in containers in the fridge. This makes it easy to grab healthy snacks when hunger strikes. Hard-boiled eggs are another great option. Make a dozen at the start of the week as they’re perfect for a quick protein boost. Don’t forget about classic snacks like cheese and crackers or peanut butter and apple slices. These are simple to prepare and always a hit. I really like these children’s lunch boxes for my daughter. I’ll make her a bunch of snacks or lunch early in the morning so that she can grab it whenever she is hungry. Having snacks ready to go means less time in the kitchen and more time for work and family. 6. Plan around nap times If you want to learn how to work from home with kids, the best way is to use nap times wisely! Many young kids take a nap from around 1-2 hours long, so nap times are golden hours for working parents. They give you a chunk of uninterrupted time to focus on tasks that need your full attention. Use nap times for tasks that require silence, deep thinking, or creativity. This might include writing reports, brainstorming ideas, conference calls, or tackling hard problems. If your kids have different nap schedules, take advantage of each quiet moment. Even short periods can be useful for checking emails or making quick phone calls. If your children have outgrown naps, you may want to try implementing quiet time instead. This can still provide you with a window of time to focus on work tasks. I personally get a lot of work done while my daughter naps. I am very lucky in that I run my own business so I get to choose my own hours. I choose to work nowadays mainly when my daughter is sleeping, such as during her nap time and late at night. But, I do realize that not all work-from-home jobs have this flexibility. 7. Set boundaries with family Working from home with kids can be tricky. This is because sometimes other people in your family may not think that working from home is a real job, so they may not think you are actually busy. I recommend that you: Talk to your spouse (if you have one) and let them know when you need quiet time for important calls or tasks. Create a visual signal to show when you’re working. This could be a closed door or a special sign on your desk. Stick to your work hours as much as possible. This helps your family understand when you’re available and when you’re not. Ask for help from your partner or other family members. They can keep the kids busy during your most important work hours. It’s important to set clear boundaries with your family to stay productive. 8. Involve kids in simple tasks Getting kids involved in easy tasks can help you work from home more smoothly. It keeps them busy and teaches them new skills. Ask your kids to help with small chores. They can fold laundry, sort socks, or put away toys. This gives them a sense of helping out and keeps them occupied. For younger kids, set up a pretend office next to yours. Give them old papers, a toy laptop, or a notepad. They can “work” alongside you, feeling like they’re part of your day. During your breaks, involve kids in preparing snacks or lunch. They can help make sandwiches or put fruit in bowls. This doubles as a fun activity and takes care of meals. Remember to praise their efforts. This encourages them to keep helping and makes them feel valued. With these ideas, you can work and spend time with your kids all at once. 9. Encourage independent play Independent play is great for work-from-home parents because it gives kids a chance to entertain themselves. For parents, it provides some much-needed quiet time to focus on tasks without constant interruptions. It helps kids learn to be self-sufficient, and it gives parents a break to catch up on work or even take a moment to recharge. Some ideas for independent play include: Set up a special play area with toys and activities they like. This helps them stay busy and have fun. Try putting out sensory bins. These are containers filled with fun stuff to touch and explore. You can use rice, beans, or sand. Add small toys or scoops for extra fun. I LOVE sensory bins, and so does my daughter. Here are some of my favorites. Crafts are great for independent play. Leave out paper, crayons, and stickers. Kids can make pictures or cards while you work nearby. Books are another good choice. Put out a few new ones each day to keep things fresh. Picture books work well for younger kids. Rotate toys and activities often. This keeps play time exciting so your child won’t get bored as quickly if they have new things to discover. Remember, it’s okay if your child plays alone for short times. This helps them learn and grow. You can still check in and show interest in what they’re doing. I rely on independent play a lot when working from home with my 2-year-old. I set up fun activities, like sensory bins or puzzles, and give her the space to explore on her own while I get some work done. It’s not always perfect – sometimes she needs me after a few minutes – but I’ve found that with the right activities, she can stay engaged for longer stretches. It gives me just enough time to focus on a task or jump on a quick call. We also don’t do a lot of TV at home and we set screen time rules. Now, I do want to say that independent play can be hard, especially for younger children or children who are just starting to get used to it. It may only be 5-10 minutes at first. But, it typically gets longer and better as time goes on. 10. Find a work-from-home group in your area Working from home with kids can feel lonely. But you’re not alone! Many parents are in the same boat. A great way to connect is by finding a work-from-home group near you. These groups often meet up once a week or more. Parents work while kids play together so it’s a win-win for everyone. You can look for these groups on sites like Facebook. If you have a local parent Facebook group near you, then you may be able to post a new thread and ask if there is one that you can join. Meeting at someone’s home is common. This gives kids a safe place to play while parents get work done and it also lets kids make new friends and have fun. 11. Think about finding childcare Working from home with kids can be tough. You might need some help to get your work done and childcare is an option worth thinking about. There are different types of childcare you can look into. Daycare centers, in-home daycares, and hiring a nanny (a nanny share can be a great option too!) are some choices. Each has its own good points and costs. Part-time childcare is another idea. Maybe you only need help for a few hours each day. This can give you some quiet time to focus on important tasks. I have a friend who hires a babysitter for a few hours a day each week so that she and her husband can get some uninterrupted work done (they both work at home). You might team up with other parents. You could take turns watching each other’s kids and this way, you all get some work time without spending money. After juggling work and taking care of my 2-year-old full-time, I recently started using part-time childcare to help me get more focused work hours. Now that she goes to preschool three days a week, I have more uninterrupted time to complete tasks, which has made a huge difference in my productivity. It also allows me to be more present when we’re together, as I can focus on her needs without worrying about deadlines. She also absolutely LOVES the preschool that she goes to (she has made so many friends and loves her teachers so much – it is so wonderful to see), and it’s one of the best decisions I have ever made as a parent.

How To Work From Home With Kids – Summary I hope you enjoyed my article on how to work from home with kids. For the first 2 ½ years of being a parent, I worked from home with my daughter at my side.

I set up fun activities, like sensory bins or puzzles, and give her the space to explore on her own while I get some work done. It’s not always perfect – sometimes she needs me after a few minutes – but I’ve found that with the right activities, she can stay engaged for longer stretches. It gives me just enough time to focus on a task or jump on a quick call. We also don’t do a lot of TV at home and we set screen time rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I do want to say that independent play can be hard, especially for younger children or children who are just starting to get used to it.

You might need some help to get your work done and childcare is an option worth thinking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are different types of childcare you can look into.

It also allows me to be more present when we’re together, as I can focus on her needs without worrying about deadlines.
