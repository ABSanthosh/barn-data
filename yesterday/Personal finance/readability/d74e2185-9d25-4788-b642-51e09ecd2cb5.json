I made $15 in… Have you ever wondered if you can actually make money taking online surveys? I decided to put one to the test and see if it’s worth my time. So, I spent two hours on Survey Junkie, taking paid online surveys, trying different strategies, redeeming my points, and cashing out. My results? I made $15 in two hours. While it’s not life-changing money, I think answering paid online surveys is an easy way to earn extra cash while watching TV, sitting on the couch, or whenever you have some free time. Since you can take surveys anytime – morning, afternoon, or late at night – it’s a super flexible way to make extra money. In this blog post, I’ll share my full experience using Survey Junkie, including how much I made per survey, my strategy to make more money per hour, how to avoid getting disqualified, and how quickly I was able to cash out. Please click here to sign up for Survey Junkie. How I Made $15 in 2 Hours Taking Surveys – Is It Worth It? Here’s my experience and what I think. What survey company did I test? For this experiment, I used Survey Junkie. Survey Junkie is an online platform that pays users to complete surveys, helping companies collect feedback for market research. All kinds of businesses need to hear real opinions from a diverse group of people, and that’s where you and I come in. Survey Junkie is one of the most well-known survey sites out there and is available in the U.S., Canada, and Australia. Who can sign up? Anyone 16 years or older can join for free. How do you earn? You take surveys and earn points, which can be redeemed for PayPal cash, bank transfers, or gift cards. How much can you make? It depends on how many surveys you qualify for, but payouts range from a few cents to a couple of dollars per survey. You can learn more at Survey Junkie Review. Also, there are many other survey companies that you may be interested in as well, such as: American Consumer Opinion Swagbucks Branded Surveys Prime Opinion User Interviews What kind of questions do they ask? Most surveys are simple and ask about your shopping habits, opinions on brands, or daily activities. Here are a few sample questions I came across: How often do you buy coffee from a coffee shop? What brands of shampoo have you purchased in the past 3 months? Which streaming services do you subscribe to? Have you traveled by plane in the past year? Do you own a pet? If so, what kind? How old is your child and what is their favorite TV show? Some surveys were longer and more detailed, while others were super quick and easy. I would say that 99% of the surveys that I have done in my life have been easy. I did come across one survey that actually asked me a bunch of difficult math questions. I got one of them wrong (I was trying to answer them quickly and I was stumped by the question haha!), so I was kicked out of the survey. I was actually surprised that it was included – so I don’t think this was a normal survey. How I Made $15 on Survey Junkie in 2 Hours To really test it out, I spent two hours answering surveys on Survey Junkie, focusing on the ones that paid the most per minute. Here’s what I found: Here is a screenshot of my dashboard of the points I can earn for each survey I answer. 1. Choose surveys with the best payouts Not all surveys pay the same, so I quickly learned that picking the right ones makes a big difference. Some surveys paid just a few points for 10+ minutes, while others paid way more for less time. Here are some examples to show you what I’m talking about: You can earn 205 points for a 10-minute survey, which is 20 points per minute (I hopped on this one so fast, and it was actually one of the easiest surveys I have ever taken! – I was shocked at how easy it was). You can earn 110 points for an 11-minute survey, which is 10 points per minute. You can earn 100 points for a 17-minute survey, which is 6 points per minute. You can earn 40 points for a 21-minute survey, which is 2 points per minute. For me, I tried to only do surveys that paid 5 points or more per minute. I didn’t even give a second look to the ones that paid 1 or 2 points per minute, as I didn’t think those would be worth it. I did appreciate how Survey Junkie would list all three (the total points you can earn, the amount of time, and the points per minute) so that I could quickly analyze which one I wanted to take. My tip is to refresh your page often to get new survey options. If you don’t like the current selection, new ones will appear when you refresh. I did this a lot so that I would always see the highest points-per-minute surveys. Here’s a screenshot of a reward I received for being kicked out of a survey. 2. Expect some disqualifications One thing to know about answering surveys is that you won’t qualify for every survey. Sometimes, you’ll start a survey only to get kicked out if you don’t match their target audience. However, Survey Junkie still rewards you with small points (like 3 points) for trying. It’s not much, but it does add up over time and it’s better than getting nothing. I wasn’t kicked out too much. There was one time when I was kicked out of maybe 3 or 4 surveys in a row, which was annoying. But then after that, I was accepted into some high-paying ones so I was happy again. 3. Pay attention to trick questions Some surveys test to make sure you’re actually paying attention. They’ll include instructions like, “Enter C for #13.” If you don’t follow that exactly, you’ll be disqualified immediately. This is to prevent people from randomly clicking answers just to earn points – so it’s something to be aware of! A bonus offer I received. 4. Take advantage of bonus offers Survey Junkie sometimes gives bonuses for being consistent. For example, I received a 500-point bonus offer for completing surveys 7 days in a row. Also, about once a day, a pop-up appears where you can earn 1 point instantly just by answering a single question. This helps match you to surveys better so that you qualify for more of them in the future. I always answered these because I wanted to make sure that I was getting the best surveys sent to me (and then be less likely to be disqualified later because I wasn’t a match). This is what my withdrawal dashboard looks like. You can see some of the points I’ve earned on the right and my withdrawal options on the left. How to redeem points and get paid One of the best things about Survey Junkie is that you can cash out as soon as you hit 500 points ($5). You can get: PayPal (1 to 3 business days) Bank transfer (up to 5 business days) Gift cards (Amazon, Walmart, Apple, Target, Starbucks, Sephora, and Groupon) I was able to cash out my earnings quickly and easily. I chose to redeem my points for $15 in free Amazon gift cards. Pros and cons of Survey Junkie Here’s what I think are the pros and cons of this survey site: Pros: It’s an easy way to earn extra cash in your spare time. The $5 payout threshold is low. Multiple cash-out options (PayPal, bank transfer, gift cards) are available. Bonus opportunities for daily participation are offered. You still earn small points even if you get disqualified. Cons: Some surveys will disqualify you after a few questions. Not all surveys pay well for your time. How to get started with Survey Junkie Getting started is easy, and it’s completely free. Here’s how to sign up: Click here to sign up for Survey Junkie. Complete your profile to get matched with the best surveys. Start taking surveys and earning points. Cash out your points for PayPal cash, bank transfers, or free gift cards. Is Taking Surveys Worth It? My Honest Thoughts So, is taking surveys a legit way to make money? Yes. Sure, it’s not a way to get rich, but if you’re looking for an easy way to make extra money in your free time, it’s a real option. It’s best for people who want: A simple, no-cost way to earn a little extra cash Something flexible that they can do anytime, even when watching TV Small rewards that add up over time If you’re expecting to make hundreds of dollars fast, though, this won’t be the best option for you. I made $15 in 2 hours on Survey Junkie, and I was able to cash out quickly with no issues. If you’re looking for a simple and legit way to earn extra money, this might be worth trying out!
