Whether… Do you want to learn how to make $15,000 a month? Making $15,000 a month can change your life. I know this because I’ve done it myself. I remember when I thought making just $1,000 extra a month would be incredible. And now, I’ve been earning well over $15,000 a month for many years. Whether you want to make this much full-time or as extra income on top of what you already earn, there are many ways to get there. You don’t need to do something risky or invest a ton of money. In fact, many of the ways I’ll share in this article have a flexible schedule, are beginner-friendly, and can be done from home. From blogging to freelance work to selling digital products and more, there are lots of ways to build up to $15,000 a month. Best Ways To Make $15,000 a Month Below are the top ways to make $15,000 a month. 1. Start a blog Starting a blog is one of the best things I’ve ever done, and I’ve been making over $15,000 a month from my blog for over 10 years. When I started Making Sense of Cents, I had no idea it would turn into a full-time business. I was paying off student loans and just wanted to share my journey of living paycheck to paycheck. But over time, my blog grew, and it has now helped me earn millions of dollars as well as helped millions of readers. You can make money blogging through affiliate marketing, sponsored content, digital products, ads, and more. You don’t need to be a professional writer to start (I definitely never thought I would be writing for a living when I was younger!), and you can also have a very flexible schedule (I get to decide when I work, which is wonderful!). I recommend taking my How To Start A Blog FREE Course. In this free course, I show you how to create a blog, from the technical side to earning your first income and attracting readers. Over 80,000 people have taken my free course too! Recommended reading: How To Monetize A Blog: How I Grew A $5 Million Blog 2. Create an online course or membership If you know something that could help others, you can create a course or a membership. And, you don’t need to be a super genius or have a degree to do this. Instead, think about a topic that people, such as friends and family, tend to ask you about, and brainstorm ways to turn it into a course. I’ve made over $2,000,000 from just one course I created about affiliate marketing. Courses let you teach others while earning a semi-passive income. Topics that you can teach in a course include: How to start RVing Watercolor painting Knitting Cooking Learning a language Meal planning for busy families Photography for beginners Making extra money And so much more! You can learn more at How I’ve Made Over $1,000,000 From My First Course Without a Big Launch. 3. Real estate side hustles Real estate can be a great way to earn money, especially if you want to start making $15,000 a month. You could rent out part of your home, invest in a rental property, or list your RV or backyard pool on platforms like RVshare or Swimply. Another way is to buy cheap houses that need a lot of work and renovation. You could fix them up and sell them for more (also known as house flipping). Recommended reading: 23 Best Real Estate Side Hustles To Make Extra Money 4. Remote cleaning business A remote cleaning business is a way to make $15,000 a month without doing any of the actual cleaning yourself, and it’s a business that you can run from your phone or laptop. With this type of business, you manage the business side, like scheduling, marketing, and customer service, while hiring cleaners in the local area to handle the work. You don’t need to spend a lot on marketing at first (but eventually, it can definitely help), and you may be able to find cleaning customers through methods like posting in local Facebook groups, creating flyers, or asking friends and family to spread the word. All kinds of places need cleaning, such as private homes, Airbnbs, long-term rentals, offices, and more, so there is a big demand for this type of business. You can learn more at How To Start a Remote Cleaning Business and Make $100,000+ Each Year. 5. Sell items on Amazon Amazon FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon) is when you buy products, send them to Amazon’s warehouse, and they ship them to customers. You don’t need to package or ship anything yourself once you ship to Amazon. Some people buy discounted items at stores like Walmart and TJ Maxx (called retail arbitrage), and others order inventory from suppliers. You can sell everything from home decor to pet toys. It takes some upfront cost, but people do scale this into 6-figure businesses. You can learn more at How I Quit My 9-5 And Made $1.4 Million Last Year Selling On Amazon. 6. Become a photographer If you like taking photos, then becoming a photographer could be a great way to make money. And yes, some photographers make well over $15,000 a month depending on the type of work they do, how many clients they have, and how they run their business. There are many different types of photography you can specialize in, such as: Family portraits Weddings and engagements Real estate or Airbnb listings Brand or product photography Stock photography Event photography Drone photography When I was traveling full-time, I met so many photographers who made great incomes. Some worked with brands on social media, some booked weddings years in advance, there were NatGeo photographers, and others sold their work as art or on stock photo websites.

Sell subscription boxes Starting a subscription box business can be a fun and creative way to make money, and there are people earning over $15,000 a month doing this. With a subscription box, you curate a themed package of items and send it to customers every month (or quarterly). Some ideas include: Self-care boxes Pet-themed boxes Book boxes Kids’ activity or craft kits Eco-friendly home goods Coffee or tea subscriptions Local small business samplers The important step is finding a niche and creating an experience that people love and want to keep getting. I’ve signed up for subscription boxes before that I truly looked forward to each month, and it’s easy to see how people fall in love with the right one. This can start small, you don’t need to have hundreds of customers from day one. With just 200 subscribers paying $50 per month, that’s $10,000 in monthly revenue. And with the right margins, upsells, or add-ons, it’s possible to grow from there and hit $15,000+. Of course, you do need to think about your expenses, as you will have to spend money on the items that you put into the subscription box, which can add up quickly. You can sell your subscription box on your own website using Shopify or use a marketplace like Cratejoy. You can learn more at How I’ve Made Over $1,000,000 With A Subscription Box Business. 8. Manage Facebook ads for small businesses Running Facebook ads for local businesses is one of the best side hustles from home that I recommend because it’s very doable to grow it into a $15,000-a-month business. Most small business owners know they should be advertising online, but they don’t have the time or knowledge to figure out Facebook ads. You can start by learning the basics, such as how to set up a Facebook business account, create a campaign, and test ads. Then, you can reach out to local businesses like gyms, hair salons, realtors, restaurants, or dentists and offer to help them get more customers. Many ad managers charge $1,000 to $2,000+ per client each month. So, if you can work with 7 to 10 clients, you can make $15,000 a month or more. Recommended reading: How To Make $2,000+ a Month Running Facebook Ads For Local Businesses 9. YouTube channel Starting a YouTube channel can be a fun way to make $15,000 a month, and I know people who earn well beyond that by posting videos online. With a YouTube channel, you can make money through ads, sponsorships, affiliate links, selling your own products, and more. The great thing about YouTube is that it can become passive over time because a video you post today could keep earning you money months or even years later. You don’t need to be a celebrity or have a million subscribers either. You can earn money with a much smaller audience as long as you’re providing helpful, interesting, or entertaining content. Some popular YouTube niches include personal finance, travel, parenting, RV life, cleaning, DIY, cooking, and more. It does take time to build up your channel, but with consistency and effort, it’s possible to turn YouTube into a real business.

Tech freelance work Tech freelancing can be a great way to make $15,000 a month, and you don’t need to be a computer genius or have a degree in computer science to get started. There are so many high-paying freelance skills that are in demand right now, like: Building website designs SEO (search engine optimization) Graphic design Email marketing Creating funnels And more. I’ve hired freelancers over the years to help with things like creating my site design, graphic design, technical management of my site and so much more. These are all tasks that someone learned and then turned into a real business. 11. Coaching or consulting If you’re really good at something, like budgeting, fitness, parenting, business, career advice, or even something like meal planning, then you might be surprised to know that people will actually pay to learn from you. Coaching or consulting is all about sharing your knowledge and helping others solve a problem or reach a goal. I know people who make a full-time income doing this, and it’s something that can start small and grow big over time. You can work one-on-one with clients, sell group sessions, or even create packages or programs. 12. Flipping items If you love finding deals, flipping could be for you. You buy items at a low price, like from garage sales, thrift stores, or clearance racks, and sell them for a profit on eBay or Facebook. I have flipped many items over the years, and at one point even had a small resale business where I was making hundreds of dollars in profit each month. It was a fun side hustle where I was constantly looking for deals so that I could make money. It was exciting! Recommended reading: How We Turned A Free Chair Into $103,000 13. Print on demand Print-on-demand is where you sell custom products like shirts, mugs, and cards without holding inventory. You design it once, upload it to a platform like Etsy or Printify, and they handle the rest. I’ve bought print-on-demand gifts for teachers, holidays, and more, and I know many sellers who earn thousands a month doing this. Recommended reading: How I Make $7,500 Monthly Selling Print-On-Demand Gifts 14. Freelance writing Freelance writing is a good way to work from home and make a good income. I’ve been a freelance writer for years, although I don’t write for others as much as I used to because I write so much here on Making Sense of Cents now. When I first started, I made around $25 to $50 per article (this was a long time ago – beginner rates are now a little higher than this). Eventually, I was charging $1,500 or more per article that I wrote for someone else. I know many writers today who make $15,000+ per month writing content for websites, newsletters, and businesses. Recommended reading: 14 Places To Find Freelance Writing Jobs – (How To Start With No Experience!) 15. Combine multiple income streams One of the most realistic ways to make $15,000 a month is by combining several different income streams. When I first started working for myself, I didn’t make all of my income from just one thing. I had freelance writing clients, affiliate income from my blog, a little bit from display ads, some virtual assistant clients, and more. Over time, those different streams grew, and together, they helped me reach my big income goals. For example, here’s what a real-life $15,000 per month might look like: $5,000 from freelance writing $4,000 from selling online courses or printables $2,000 from flipping items and retail arbitrage $3,000 from affiliate income through your blog or social media accounts $1,000 from part-time virtual assistant work Now, it does take dedication, the right mindset, and a lot of passion to manage this many side hustles and businesses at the same time. It won’t be easy, and it can impact your work-life balance if you’re not careful. But, the great thing about this method is that you’re not relying on just one source of income. If one area slows down, the others can help carry you through. And as you learn what you enjoy and what works best for you, you can shift your focus and grow the areas that make the most sense. This is actually exactly what I did!
