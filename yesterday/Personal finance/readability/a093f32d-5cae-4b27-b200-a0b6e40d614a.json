There was a time when I barely had enough to cover my bills, and I constantly worried about unexpected expenses. It’s stressful and exhausting to feel like you’re always behind, with… Do you want to learn how to stop living paycheck to paycheck? I know firsthand how hard it is to live paycheck to paycheck. There was a time when I barely had enough to cover my bills, and I constantly worried about unexpected expenses. It’s stressful and exhausting to feel like you’re always behind, with no room to save or plan for the future. But the good news is, change is possible. Breaking free from this cycle takes both small and big, consistent steps. By managing your money differently, you can start building a cushion, reduce stress, and take control of your finances. It’s not always easy (and at times, it may feel impossible or too late!), but even small changes can make a big difference over time. 16 Ways To Stop Living Paycheck to Paycheck Here are 16 ways to stop living paycheck to paycheck and actually start saving money. 1. Create a budget Making a budget is an important step to stop living paycheck to paycheck. Here are some steps for getting started with a budget: You’ll want to start by listing all your income sources, and this includes your salary, side jobs, and any other money you get regularly. Next, write down all your expenses. Don’t forget things like rent/mortgage, food, utilities, insurance, and transportation. Also add in any debt payments you have to make each month, such as for credit cards or medical bills. You want to look at this realistically and not just get an estimate – actually add up your expenses so that you have a real idea of how much you spend each month! Look at where your money is going. Are there areas where you can cut back? Maybe you can eat out less or cancel some subscriptions you don’t use much. If you’re anything like most people, then writing all of this down can be a real eye-opener. You may not have realized that your expenses were so much or that your income was lower due to taxes or other deductions. Looking at your budget is great because it shows you what you need to work on and what income you have to work with. It can really put things into perspective. I also recommend that you review your budget often. Your income and expenses might change, so it’s important to keep your budget up to date. This will help you stay on track and avoid falling back into the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle. Recommended reading: The Complete Budgeting Guide: How To Create A Budget That Works 2. Cut unnecessary expenses After you make your budget, I really want you to take a better look at your expenses. For some, they may feel like there is nothing they can cut back. But, for others, there is probably something. So, look at your spending habits and find areas where you can save money. This might be easier than you think. Start with your subscriptions. Do you use all the streaming services you pay for? If not, cancel the ones you don’t watch. Or, maybe you can rotate and not have so many all at once so that you are only paying for one TV service at a time. Next, check your food costs. Would shopping at a different grocery store save you money? Do you use coupons when you shop or shop with a grocery list? Look at your bills. Can you switch to a cheaper phone plan? Maybe you can lower your energy costs by using less electricity. Shopping habits matter too. Before buying something, ask yourself if you really need it. Wait a day before making big purchases. Small changes add up. Cutting a few dollars here and there can save you a lot over time. By reducing unnecessary expenses, you’ll have more money for savings and important things. This can help you break the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle. Recommended reading: The Ultimate Guide of Over 50 Money Saving Tips 3. Build an emergency fund An emergency fund is money you save for unexpected events. It can help you if you lose your job, your car breaks down, or have surprise medical bills. This is because an emergency fund can stop you from taking on more debt when surprises happen (and they do all the time!). Many people fall into a paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyle because they have to take on expensive credit card debt or even a payday loan because they can’t afford an unexpected expense, and unfortunately, these are very hard to dig your way out of. An emergency fund can seem intimidating to start, but you can definitely start small. Even $500 or $1,000 can make a big difference when something goes wrong. Eventually, over time, you may want to try to save 3 to 6 months of expenses too. I recommend that you put your emergency fund in a separate savings account. This way, you won’t mix it with your everyday money. Choose an account that’s easy to access when you need it and has a high yield. Recommended reading: How To Start An Emergency Fund Today 4. Pay off your debt Getting rid of debt can help you stop living paycheck to paycheck because it frees up your income. When you’re paying off debt, a big chunk of your money goes to monthly payments and interest, leaving less for savings or other expenses. Once you’re debt-free, you can use that money to build an emergency fund, save for goals, or invest in your future. You’ll also avoid costly interest and reduce financial stress. Paying off debt gives you more control over your money and helps you break the cycle of living paycheck to paycheck. For me, paying off my student loans helped me to stop living paycheck to paycheck too, so I know this is helpful! You can start by listing all your debts. This includes credit cards, car loans, student loan debt, and any other money you owe. Then, look at the interest rates on each debt. Focus on paying off the ones with the highest rates first as this can save you money in the long run. And, please try to pay more than the minimum amount due each month. Even a little extra can make a big difference over time. A lot of people think that paying the minimum payment on their loans each month (the amount you see at the top of your credit card bill, for example) is enough to not pay interest charges – but it’s not! Don’t be afraid to talk to your creditors. They might be willing to lower your interest rate or work out a payment plan that fits your budget better.

Use cash instead of credit cards If you’re the type of person who spends freely when using their credit card, then you may want to try using cash. This is because when you hand over real dollar bills, you feel the impact more than swiping a card. This makes you think twice about your purchases. You can start by trying the envelope method. This is where you put cash for each spending category in separate envelopes (Amazon even sells envelope method kits here to make it more motivating, if that’s what you need). When an envelope is empty, you can’t spend more in that area. Then, you leave your credit cards at home when you go shopping. This removes the temptation to overspend so you’ll stick to your budget better when you only have cash. Recommended reading: 12 Money Hacks That Will Help You Save More Money 6. Automate your savings Setting up automatic savings can help you break the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle. It’s an easy way to save money without thinking about it. You can start by opening a separate savings account, as this keeps your savings apart from your spending money. Then, set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings account. You can do this through your bank’s website or app. Of course, you’ll want to choose an amount you can afford to save each payday. Even small amounts add up over time. 7. Prioritize your needs over wants One way to stop living paycheck to paycheck is to focus on your needs and cut back on your wants. You can start by listing your essential expenses, like rent, utilities, groceries, and transportation. Then, identify the nonessentials, such as dining out, streaming subscriptions, or impulse shopping. When money is tight, prioritize your needs first. This doesn’t mean you can never enjoy your wants, but it helps to be intentional with your spending. Then, reward yourself only after your financial goals are met, like saving a specific amount or paying off a debt. By focusing on what truly matters, you’ll create more room in your budget to save and break free from financial stress. 8. Set financial goals Setting financial goals is a must for anyone who wants to change their financial life. This is because goals give you something to work toward and something to be motivated by. I recommend thinking about what your goals are in life. Do you want to buy a house? Retire? Go on a dream vacation? Buy a car? Be able to save money and have less stress? Maybe your goal is as simple as not living paycheck to paycheck. Recommended reading: 12 Ways To Stay Motivated So You Can Reach Your Money Goals 9. Try to get a raise at work Getting a raise can help you earn more money so that your income is higher than your monthly expenses. My tips for getting a raise at work: Start by doing great work at your job. Keep track of your accomplishments and write down the good things you do at work. This will help you when you ask for a raise. Talk to your boss about your goals. Ask what you can do to earn more money. They might give you tips on how to improve. Practice asking for a raise. You can do this with a friend or in front of a mirror, and it will help you feel more confident when you talk to your boss. Choose a good time to ask. Don’t do it when your boss is busy or stressed. Pick a time when things are going well at work. Be ready to explain why you deserve more money. Talk about how you’ve helped the company and show how your work has made a difference. If your boss says no, don’t give up. Ask what you can do to earn a raise in the future, and then work on those things and try again later. 10. Find a side hustle A side hustle can help you earn extra money, which can help you make more money than your expenses. The main way that I stopped living paycheck to paycheck was that I started a side hustle (this blog that you’re reading, actually! I have a free blogging course here if you want to learn how) and I applied most of my side income toward my student loans. There are many different side hustles you can start. Some of the things I have done over the years include: Blogging Virtual assisting Freelance writing Taking online surveys Selling items online Getting a part-time job And more.

Cook at home more often Eating out can drain your wallet fast and cooking at home is a smart way to save money and stop living paycheck to paycheck. Restaurant meals often cost much more than making the same food yourself. When you cook at home, you control what goes into your meals and how much you spend. Plan your meals for the week before you go grocery shopping. This helps you buy only what you need and avoid waste. Look for sales and use coupons to save even more money on groceries. Try making big batches of food and freezing extra portions. This gives you quick meals for busy days without the temptation to order takeout. For me, I like making extra food at dinnertime and then using the leftovers for lunch the next day. And, leftover lunch doesn’t always have to be the same! For example, if I make beef tacos for dinner, I may turn that into something slightly different the next day, such as quesadillas, taco salad, or nachos for lunch.

Use cash back sites Cash back sites can help you save money on things you buy anyway. These sites give you a percentage of your purchase back as cash so it’s like getting a small discount on everything you buy. To use cash back sites, you sign up for free. Then, you shop through their website or app. When you buy something, you earn cash back. My favorite cash back sites are: Fetch Rewards (for in-person grocery shopping) Swagbucks (for online and grocery shopping) Rakuten (for online shopping and vacation booking) Upside (for gas/fuel purchases) I personally use ALL of these cash back sites as they can be used for different types of shopping. 13. Find free entertainment Looking for fun activities that don’t cost money can help you save. Here are some ideas: Your town likely has many free events and attractions. You can check local community calendars for free concerts, festivals, and movie screenings. Parks and nature trails are great for outdoor fun at no cost. Pack a picnic and spend a day enjoying the fresh air. Many museums have free admission days each month. Libraries are great for free entertainment. Borrow books, movies, and music. Some even have free classes and workshops, and they even let you borrow state park passes, hiking equipment, instruments, and more. Invite friends over for a game night or potluck dinner. This can be more fun and cheaper than going out. 14. Plan for future expenses Thinking ahead can save you from money troubles. Due to this, I recommend that you look at your calendar and think about big costs coming up. This could be things like fixing your car, buying gifts for the holidays, or car insurance payments. You’ll want to start putting money aside now for these expenses. Even small amounts can add up over time. You might set up a special savings account just for these future costs. This way, when the time comes to pay, you’ll be ready. You won’t have to scramble, use credit cards, or feel all of that stress that you may normally feel when your monthly expenses are higher than normal. 15. Live below your means Living below your means means spending less than you earn, and this habit can help you save money and build wealth over time. This may mean living in a small house, not upgrading your car as often, buying used clothing when you can, and not feeling the lifestyle creep that can happen as you get older. 16. Take advantage of free resources You can find many free resources to help you save money. Some examples include: Look for food pantries in your area, as they give out free food to people who need it. Many cities have free health and dental clinics. These can help you save on medical costs. Look for free exercise classes in parks or community centers. Your local government website may list more free services. These could include job training or housing help.

How do you avoid living paycheck by paycheck? To stop living paycheck to paycheck, one way is to make a budget and write down all your income and expenses. Look for areas where you can cut back, and try to save a little money each month, even if it’s just a small amount. Is it normal for people to live paycheck to paycheck? Many people live paycheck to paycheck. It’s common, but it’s not ideal. Just because others live paycheck to paycheck doesn’t mean that you should. Unfortunately, about 60% of Americans struggle to make ends meet each month. This can happen to people at all income levels. Why do even people with good salaries sometimes struggle with savings? People with high salaries can still have money problems. They might spend too much on things or have big debts. Some may not track their spending or have a budget. Others might live in expensive areas with high costs. Learning to manage money well is important no matter how much you earn. How can I create a budget when my money is gone after paying bills? You can still have a budget even if your money is gone after paying your bills. You can start by listing all your income and expenses. Look for any costs you can cut, like subscriptions or eating out. Try to find cheaper options for things you need. See if you can earn extra money through a side job. Put any extra cash toward savings or paying off debt. Every little bit helps! What are some steps I can take to save my first $1,000? To save $1,000, start small. Put aside $5 or $10 each week. Cut back on extras like coffee shops or takeout. Sell items you don’t need. Look for free activities instead of paid ones. Use coupons and shop sales. Put any extra money from work or gifts into savings. Be patient and consistent. I have a $20 Savings Challenge which can help you save $1,040 in one year here. How can I pay off my debt living paycheck to paycheck? Paying off debt while living paycheck to paycheck is hard but possible. First, make a list of all your debts. Pay the minimum on each one. If you can, pay extra on the highest interest rate debt. When that’s paid off, move to the next. I also recommend that you look for ways to earn extra money to put toward debt, as well as talk to your creditors about lower interest rates or payment plans.
