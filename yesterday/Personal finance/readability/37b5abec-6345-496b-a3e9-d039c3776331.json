  "text": "The US just added 139,000 new jobs in May. That beat expectations. But the real story isn’t in the job numbers — it’s in the bond market. Something unusual is happening in bonds. Treasury yields are spiking. The dollar is weakening. That combination almost never happens together. And it’s signaling concerns about future inflation. Trade wars continue on. A federal court just struck down some tariffs. The administration will appeal. Meanwhile, the EU has until July 9 to cut a deal. If they don’t, 50 percent tariffs kick in. As a result, many companies are playing defense instead of growing. The debt situation keeps getting worse. We owe $36.2 trillion. That’s more than we owed at the end of World War II as a percentage of our economy. Moody’s just downgraded our credit rating. We’re not alone — Britain’s bonds just hit their highest levels since 1998. The accredited investor rules could finally change. Right now you need an income of $200,000 ($300,000 as a couple) or $1 million in net worth to access private markets. Those numbers haven’t changed since they were written in 1982, even though adjusted for inflation, that $200,000 would be $662,000 today. The SEC might start loosening enforcement of the accredited investor rules. That could open up more investments to people who’ve been locked out for decades. Crypto is finding its footing. The SEC dropped cases against Coinbase. They’re backing away from treating most crypto like securities. Bitcoin sits near all-time highs. The US keeps building its strategic Bitcoin reserve. The House just passed what’s being called the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” It extends 2017 tax cuts. Eliminates taxes on tips and overtime. The Congressional Budget Office says it’ll add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. That’s sparked debate between deficit hawks and growth advocates —  including one particularly high-profile debate that has been plastered across the headlines. Consumer sentiment stays stuck at 2022 lows. People expect 6.6 percent inflation. The actual rate is 2.3 percent. That gap between what the data says and what people feel shows up everywhere. We cover all of this in today’s First Friday economic update. Thanks to our sponsors! Indeed If you’re looking for amazing talent to bolster your team, you need Indeed.
