Here’s how you can find out how much your Legos are worth as well as the best places to sell your Legos. Legos are very popular, and they are also expensive. So, instead of doing nothing with them, you may be wondering if you can make extra money with them instead. I personally think that selling your old Legos is a great way to declutter and make extra money. So many people have tubs and tubs of unused Legos that they either toss or let collect dust. Luckily, there are quite a few places to sell Legos, and I’ll be going over the best places to sell these favorite toys. Where To Sell Old Legos for Cash Below is a list of the best places to sell old Legos. Recommended reading: 9 Best Places To Sell Old Toys 1. BrickLink BrickLink is one of the most popular places to sell LEGO products. This platform sells both new and used LEGO sets, minifigures, and individual bricks. People who frequent the site include LEGO enthusiasts, collectors, and builders who are looking for rare or specific LEGO pieces. BrickLink also has unique community features like building tools, wish lists, and storefronts for independent sellers, so it is a very popular spot for people who like Legos. In fact, Bricklink has over 1,000,000 registered members, 10,000 sellers in its marketplace, and has had over 127,000 unique LEGO items for sale. To become a seller on BrickLink, you need to register and set up a free account, and then share your store details including store name, payment methods, and shipping options. Then you’ll set prices, conditions (new/used), and descriptions of each item. There are fees for selling on BrickLink too. 2. eBay  EBay is a popular spot to sell Legos because there’s a large audience of LEGO fans on the site. There’s a high demand for some LEGO sets, making eBay a great spot to hold an auction or list your item for a fixed price. You can also take advantage of eBay’s price history to see what similar LEGO items have sold for. Plus, another great thing about eBay is that nearly everyone has heard of eBay, so you have a lot of casual browsers on the site who may be searching for Legos.

Facebook Marketplace  Facebook Marketplace is a great option for LEGO sellers because you can sell items locally for free or via shipping nationwide. This may be more convenient for sellers who are looking to sell items right away and make money quickly. Other benefits of selling Legos via Facebook Marketplace include: You keep 100% of the profit when selling directly to buyers (such as when you meet up with them in a parking lot). If you use Facebook checkout for shipping, there may be small fees, but they are usually lower than eBay fees. Buyers pick up items in person, saving you time and money on shipping. When meeting someone in person from Facebook, always go with your gut and stay safe. Meet in a safe, public area that is well-lit. Bringing a friend or telling someone where you are is also a good idea. Many people will ask to meet right in a police department parking lot, for example. 4. Facebook groups Facebook groups dedicated to Legos are hotspots to sell Legos because you’re getting the exact audience you want. A few popular LEGO Facebook groups include: LEGO Buy, Sell, Trade (BST) LEGO Collectors \u0026 Resellers Local LEGO Buy/Sell General Toy Collectors To find Facebook groups, you can search “LEGO Buy Sell Trade” or “LEGO Marketplace.” Facebook groups always have rules, so make sure to follow rules or else you’ll get kicked out of the group permanently. Respond to comments and messages quickly and perhaps try bundling items so you can sell and make more money. Another idea similar to this is to find LEGO forums. These typically have a lot of potential buyers (just like LEGO Facebook groups) and are filled with the right buyers. 5. Mercari Mercari is a great site to sell Legos because of how easy it is to use and its low fees. Currently, Mercari charges a 10% seller fee. You get access to a wide pool of buyers, including collectors and LEGO lovers. Creating a Mercari listing is easy and straightforward. Once your account is made, you can upload high-quality photos of your Legos, write a description, and set a price. Then, just choose your shipping method (Mercari provides discounted shipping labels), and you can accept offers from buyers. Once your product is sold, you’ll ship the item using the provided label and get paid directly to your bank account. Recommended reading: 16 Best Apps For Selling Things Online And Locally 6. Craigslist  Craigslist is one of the most simple and user-friendly platforms out there and you’ve probably already used it before. There are no fees to sell on Craigslist and you sell locally only, which also means you have to be comfortable meeting with someone in person. Just like any other platform, there are scams, so it’s important to stay aware and stick with your gut when it comes to selling stuff on here. Here are some of the best tips for successfully selling things on Craigslist: Use a clear, descriptive title with specific details (for example, “LEGO Star Wars Set 75292 – Complete with Minifigures”). Take high-quality, well-lit photos of the actual item and key features. Provide a concise description with key details (set number, condition, missing parts, etc.). Repost your listing regularly to keep it visible. Use relevant keywords for better visibility in search results. Be transparent about any issues or missing parts. Now, there is one big downside to selling on Craigslist and that is that it can be hard for people to see your ad. So, you may not make much money and it may take longer. And, if you live in a small town, then no one may be looking for Legos to buy either. Recommended reading: How I Earned $655 From Random Craigslist Jobs 7. Garage sale  Selling Legos at a garage sale (or yard sale) is a great way to get rid of them quickly and conveniently. This may be a good option if you have a lot to get rid of and you’re simply looking to declutter easily. You can group your LEGO sets together (even better if you have the instruction manuals) and display them in clear containers or bags. You can sell bundle deals like “$5 for small sets” or “$10 for large sets.” This is a great idea to get rid of things more quickly. Here are some tips for a successful garage sale: Post the event details of your garage sale on Facebook Marketplace, Facebook groups, and local community boards. Set clear dates and times, with weekends usually being best. Group similar items together for easy browsing. Use price tags or signs and be prepared to negotiate. These tips will help make your garage sale more organized and successful! Recommended reading: 10 Garage Sale Tips To Make Extra Money 8. Amazon If you have a lot of new LEGO sets and inventory, you can try selling LEGO sets on Amazon too. Amazon is one of the best sites for selling sealed, brand-new LEGO sets, especially if they are retired or rare (you can see an example of them for sale on Amazon by clicking here). Some sets can sell for double or even triple their original retail price due to high demand from collectors. There are two main ways to sell LEGO sets on Amazon: Amazon Marketplace (Individual Seller Account) – If you have only a few sets to sell, you can list them under the existing LEGO product listings on Amazon. You’ll set your own price and fulfill orders yourself by shipping directly to buyers. Amazon FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) – If you want a hands-off approach, you can send your LEGO sets to an Amazon warehouse. Amazon will store them, ship them to customers, and handle customer service. However, FBA fees can cut into your profit, so be sure to calculate costs before choosing this route. One of the biggest benefits of selling on Amazon is its huge customer base. Millions of people shop on Amazon daily, so if your LEGO sets are priced competitively, they can sell quickly. However, Amazon has strict rules about selling toys, including LEGO sets. You may need approval to sell in the Toys \u0026 Games category, and your seller account must be in good standing. If you’re selling during the holiday season, Amazon may require additional verification to make sure that your items are real. Recommended reading: How to Quit Your Job \u0026 Build An Incredible Side Income on Amazon Frequently Asked Questions Here are answers to some common questions about where to sell old Legos. Is it worth selling old Legos? Yes, I think it is worth it to sell your old Legos because there is a high demand for rare LEGO sets. Even old or discounted LEGO sets can sell for a lot of money, especially if they’re in good condition. If you have items that are incomplete, they may even have value depending on the set. Rare minifigures may be in demand by collectors and builders. And, if you have a ton of Legos and they’re mixed bricks, you can still make money selling them in bulk locally or online. Where is the best place to sell Legos?  The best place to sell Legos depends on what your goals are. For example, if you want to get rid of stuff quickly and conveniently, selling on Facebook Marketplace or having a garage sale might be the way to go. However, you won’t make the most money that way. If you want to make the most money but put your time and effort in, platforms like eBay or Bricklink may be more worth it as the audience and demand is there. How much is 20 pounds of Legos worth?  If you want to sell Legos by the pound, you have options. Twenty pounds of Legos can go for a little or a lot depending on the rarity and quality of the Legos. If you’re selling a mixed lot of unsorted Legos in bulk, that’ll probably go for anywhere between $50 and $200. If your 20 pounds includes rare and in-demand sets, it could be worth over $200. How to sell unwanted LEGO sets? If you’re having trouble selling old LEGO sets, there are a few things you can do, including: Sort and clean the set (check for missing pieces and clean off any dust or dirt). Gather the instructions and box (if possible, as it increases value). Price the set (research similar listings on eBay, BrickLink, etc., and factor in condition; new sets are worth more, but used sets with complete pieces still have value. Offer bundle discounts for multiple sets). Create a detailed listing (include high-quality photos, provide an honest description of condition, and specify shipping details). Be ready to negotiate (buyers may want to haggle, so decide if you’re open to offers). Where to sell used LEGO in bulk?  The best sites to sell used Legos in bulk include eBay (since you can reach an international audience who are looking for your exact Legos) or Facebook Marketplace (since you can sell locally or ship nationwide). Does LEGO buy back old Legos? LEGO Group does not buy old Legos, but they do have a LEGO Replay program that allows you to donate used sets to charity. The sets you send in need to be cleaned, sorted, and then can be donated to children in need. You can also donate your old Legos to local charities, schools, or community centers. Will pawn shops buy Legos? Pawn shops usually don’t buy Legos, but some shops may be willing to buy them if they’re a rare set or in really good condition. The price these shops offer will likely be a lot lower than if you sold your Legos yourself, since the pawn shop needs to make a profit off selling your Legos. But, it can’t hurt to call some pawn shops in your area and ask if they buy them if you want an easier way to sell your old Legos. Can I donate my old Legos? If you’re ready to get rid of your Legos for good and don’t feel like going through the hassle of selling them, donating them to a thrift store is a great option. Whether you have complete sets in the original box, bulk Legos, accessories, or even if they have scratches, you can most likely donate them. Kids and parents are always looking for Legos (they are usually kids’ favorite toys after all), especially since they’re so expensive when they are brand new.

There are no fees to sell on Craigslist and you sell locally only, which also means you have to be comfortable meeting with someone in person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eJust like any other platform, there are scams, so it’s important to stay aware and stick with your gut when it comes to selling stuff on here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some of the best tips for successfully selling things on Craigslist:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUse a clear, descriptive title with specific details (for example, “LEGO Star Wars Set 75292 – Complete with Minifigures”).\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eTake high-quality, well-lit photos of the actual item and key features.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eProvide a concise description with key details (set number, condition, missing parts, etc.).\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eRepost your listing regularly to keep it visible.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eUse relevant keywords for better visibility in search results.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eBe transparent about any issues or missing parts.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, there is one big downside to selling on Craigslist and that is that it can be hard for people to see your ad.

This may be a good option if you have a lot to get rid of and you’re simply looking to declutter easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can group your LEGO sets together (even better if you have the instruction manuals) and display them in clear containers or bags.

Amazon is one of the best sites for selling sealed, brand-new LEGO sets, especially if they are retired or rare (\u003ca href=\"https://amzn.to/4hGmHF9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eyou can see an example of them for sale on Amazon by clicking here\u003c/a\u003e). Some sets can sell for double or even triple their original retail price due to high demand from collectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two main ways to sell LEGO sets on Amazon:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmazon Marketplace (Individual Seller Account)\u003c/strong\u003e – If you have only a few sets to sell, you can list them under the existing LEGO product listings on Amazon.

You may need approval to sell in the Toys \u0026amp; Games category, and your seller account must be in good standing.

Even old or discounted LEGO sets can sell for a lot of money, especially if they’re in good condition. If you have items that are incomplete, they may even have value depending on the set. Rare minifigures may be in demand by collectors and builders. And, if you have a ton of Legos and they’re mixed bricks, you can still make money selling them in bulk locally or online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere is the best place to sell Legos? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe best place to sell Legos depends on what your goals are. For example, if you want to get rid of stuff quickly and conveniently, selling on Facebook Marketplace or having a garage sale might be the way to go. However, you won’t make the most money that way. If you want to make the most money but put your time and effort in, platforms like eBay or Bricklink may be more worth it as the audience and demand is there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much is 20 pounds of Legos worth? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to sell Legos by the pound, you have options. Twenty pounds of Legos can go for a little or a lot depending on the rarity and quality of the Legos. If you’re selling a mixed lot of unsorted Legos in bulk, that’ll probably go for anywhere between $50 and $200. If your 20 pounds includes rare and in-demand sets, it could be worth over $200.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to sell unwanted LEGO sets?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re having trouble selling old LEGO sets, there are a few things you can do, including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSort and clean the set (check for missing pieces and clean off any dust or dirt).\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eGather the instructions and box (if possible, as it increases value).\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003ePrice the set (research similar listings on eBay, BrickLink, etc., and factor in condition; new sets are worth more, but used sets with complete pieces still have value.

The price these shops offer will likely be a lot lower than if you sold your Legos yourself, since the pawn shop needs to make a profit off selling your Legos. But, it can’t hurt to call some pawn shops in your area and ask if they buy them if you want an easier way to sell your old Legos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I donate my old Legos?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re ready to get rid of your Legos for good and don’t feel like going through the hassle of selling them, donating them to a thrift store is a great option. Whether you have complete sets in the original box, bulk Legos, accessories, or even if they have scratches, you can most likely donate them.
