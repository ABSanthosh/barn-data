When it comes to cashing a check, it can be a bit of a hassle, especially if you don’t have a bank account or if you don’t want to pay fees. I have personally had to use check cashing services in the past, and it can be a pain to find a place that won’t charge you an arm and a leg. Luckily, there are many places that can fit your needs. Whether you want to cash payroll checks, government checks, tax refund checks, cashier’s checks, or something else, these can be cashed even if you don’t have a traditional savings or checking account at a bank. Quick tips on check cashing There are many ways to cash checks without a bank account, such as at banks, retail stores, Walmart, with PayPal, and more. Check cashing fees can be free or over $10 per check. You will need a photo ID in order to cash a check at most places. 8 Best Places To Cash A Check If you don’t have a bank to cash a check, you do have options. You will most likely need ID to cash a check, and this is so that the place can make sure that the check is made out to you. This can be a driver’s license or passport, for example. You may also need your social security number or taxpayer identification number at some places. Below are the best places to cash a check if you don’t have a bank account.

Local bank or credit union Going to your local bank or credit union is one of the best places to cash a check and one of the easiest. If you’re already a member of a bank or credit union, then this is where you will most likely want to start first. It is an account benefit, and you can just go to your bank or credit union, or use their online app to deposit a check. If you’re not a current customer, some banks may still cash your check for a small fee. For example, one bank that has check cashing services is Regions Bank. You don’t have to have an account with Regions to cash a check, and they accept handwritten checks, out-of-state checks, tax refund checks, payroll checks, and more. They charge around 1% to 4% of the check amount. 2. Issuing banks (the bank used by the sender) If you don’t have a bank account, then you may want to try cashing the check at the issuing bank. So, wherever the person who gave you the check banks at, you may be able to go there and see if they will cash the check. This information is located near the memo line in the bottom left corner of the check. You can call a local branch to find out their check cashing policy or visit them in person to see if they can help you with this. 3. Walmart Walmart check cashing is both affordable and convenient as there are Walmarts everywhere (literally thousands!). The types of checks you can cash at Walmart include payroll checks, government checks, tax refund checks, cashier’s checks, and more. You can simply bring your check to the customer service or money services desk, and they’ll cash your check for a small fee based on the check amount. You can choose to get cash or deposit money into a Walmart MoneyCard. In Walmarts in most states, you can cash a check up to $5,000. However, between January and April of each year, this limit is increased to $7,500. What are the fees for cashing a check at Walmart? For pre-printed checks up to $1,000, the maximum fee is $4. If the pre-printed check is over $1,000, the maximum fee is $8. For two-party personal checks, the limit is $200, and the maximum fee is $6. 4. Check cashing services Check cashing businesses are places that are specifically for cashing checks for people who don’t have bank accounts. These businesses tend to charge higher fees, so it’s important to compare the different options you have near you first so that you don’t waste too much of your money. An example is ACE Cash Express and they have locations all over the U.S. With ACE Cash Express, you simply bring your check and a valid, government-issued ID to an ACE store. They then scan your check and you get cash if your check is approved. Ace accepts payroll checks, personal checks, income tax refund checks, money orders, and more. Note: With check cashing businesses, you will want to see if they run a credit check before giving you cash. Some places do, so this is something to think about. 5. Grocery stores Many local retailers and grocery stores have check-cashing services at their money services desks. Usually the fees are lower, and it’s pretty quick and easy. You simply just give your check and ID to the customer service desk for cashing. Some grocery stores that cash checks include: Kroger Publix City Market Fred Meyer Winn-Dixie Albertsons Fry’s Cashing a check at a grocery store typically costs around $5 to $10 for up to $5,000. 6. Endorse the check to a friend or family member If you’re comfortable with the idea, you might be able to endorse the check to a trusted friend or family member who can then deposit it into their account and give you the cash. You will want to make sure that their bank will accept a check that you have endorsed over, as some banks may not accept them (these are called third-party checks, as an FYI). Endorsing a check over to someone else is easy and here’s how you can do it: Turn the check over – Flip the check so that you are looking at the back of the check, as this is where you endorse a check. Write your signature – On the top half of the back side, you’ll see a space with lines labeled “Endorse Here” or something similar. Write the phrase “Pay to the order of” followed by the person’s name to whom you’re giving the check. Sign your name – Below your endorsement, sign your name just like it appears on the front of the check. Give the check – Now, the check is endorsed over to a person you trust, and they can deposit or cash it. Remember, once you’ve endorsed a check, it becomes theirs, so make sure you trust the person you’re giving it to. You don’t want them to steal your money and not give you the cash in the end. Note: If you’re unsure about any aspect of endorsing a check, I highly recommend reaching out to a bank or a financial advisor for help. 7. Gas stations and 7-Eleven Some gas stations have check cashing services. While they, of course, charge fees, it can be an easy option for when you’re on the go. Some gas stations that accept checks include Pilot Flying J and TravelCenters of America. Your average everyday gas station most likely will not do cash checking because they can’t or don’t want to carry large amounts of cash on them for safety reasons. Also, another option is 7-Eleven. They tend to have check cashing services as well, through their service Transact by 7-Eleven. This is similar to a prepaid debit card. 8. Online check cashing There are also mobile apps where you can cash checks. These include: PayPal – If you have a PayPal account, you can cash a check with their mobile check cashing feature. You can use the PayPal app by taking a picture of both sides of the check you want to cash. You can get your cash immediately for a minimum fee of $5, or you can wait 10 days and there won’t be any fee. Ingo Money – Ingo Money is an app where you can cash checks right from your phone. Once your check is approved, you can get the money in your bank account, prepaid card, or PayPal account, or even buy an Amazon gift card. The Ingo Money app charges anywhere from around $5.00 to 4% for cashing a check with their app. So, if you prefer to not use check cashing services near you, you also have online options. Frequently Asked Questions About Places To Cash Checks Below are answers to common questions about where to cash checks near you. Where is the easiest place to cash a check? The easiest place to cash a check is usually your personal bank or credit union, as you might have access to free check cashing and instant access to the cash. If you don’t have a bank account, I highly recommend finding one and signing up. My favorite way to cash a check is either through direct deposit or using my bank’s mobile app to deposit a check as these two ways are extremely easy (you simply take pictures of the front and back of a check). Where can I cash a check without a bank account? If you don’t have a bank account, you can try cashing your check at the bank listed on the check itself. They may have specific requirements and fees, but it’s a good place to start. There are many other places as well to cash a check without a bank account, as listed above. Where can I cash a personal check nearby? You can cash a personal check at your local bank, credit union, grocery stores like Walmart or Kroger, and some check cashing stores. Not every place will accept a personal check, so you will want to call and ask first. Can I cash my check through an ATM? Some bank ATMs and mobile banking apps allow you to deposit checks, but you’ll need to have a bank account with that institution to actually get cash. Will Kroger cash my check? Kroger, as well as some other grocery stores, have check cashing services too. Is check cashing available at Walgreens? Walgreens does not have check cashing services. They used to several years ago, but it is not a service that they still have. Where can I cash a $20,000 check without a bank account? If you need to cash a large check, such as $20,000, you do have some options. Cashing a large check like this without a bank account might be difficult, but you can try contacting the issuing bank and asking about their policies and requirements for cashing large checks. Small places like your local gas station or even Walmart most likely won’t cash it. How much does it cost to cash a check without a bank account? The fees for cashing a check depend on where you are trying to cash a check. Check cashing fees can range from $1 to more than $100. Can I cash a check without an ID? It’s almost always required to have a photo ID in order to cash a check. However, some check cashing locations might have alternative ways that don’t require an ID. You would need to call around to the different check cashing places to see what your options are. Having a valid ID is needed when cashing a check because it verifies your identity. After all, the name on the check is who should be cashing the check, so the place will want to make sure it is you. Some common forms of ID accepted at most check cashing places are: Government ID (such as a driver’s license or state-issued ID) Photo ID (such as a passport) Two forms of ID may be required in some cases How long do you have to cash a check? You usually have around three to six months to cash a check from the date it was issued. So, make sure you read the check to see what the time frame is, as it can vary depending on who gave you the check. What are the steps to cash a check without a bank account? Cashing a check without a bank account is possible, and here are the easy steps you can follow: Visit a check cashing store or retailer – Choose from the list above to cash your check. Bring identification – You’ll need a government-issued ID like a driver’s license or passport to show that you are the person named on the check. Endorse the check – Turn the check over and sign your name on the back. Pay the fee – If you’re not cashing the check at a bank that you’re a member at, then you will probably have to pay a fee. Get your cash – Lastly, you’ll get the cash from the check. Most places will give you straight cash, but others may pay through a prepaid debit card, MoneyGram, or even a gift card. Remember, not all places have check cashing services, and fees can vary. It’s a good idea to call ahead to confirm they can cash your specific type of check and to ask about their fees. Also, keep in mind that some checks (like personal checks) may be harder to cash without a bank account.

If you don’t have a bank account, I highly recommend finding one and signing up. My favorite way to cash a check is either through direct deposit or using my bank’s mobile app to deposit a check as these two ways are extremely easy (you simply take pictures of the front and back of a check).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere can I cash a check without a bank account?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you don’t have a bank account, you can try cashing your check at the bank listed on the check itself. They may have specific requirements and fees, but it’s a good place to start. There are many other places as well to cash a check without a bank account, as listed above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere can I cash a personal check nearby?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can cash a personal check at your local bank, credit union, grocery stores like Walmart or Kroger, and some check cashing stores.

Cashing a large check like this without a bank account might be difficult, but you can try contacting the issuing bank and asking about their policies and requirements for cashing large checks. Small places like your local gas station or even Walmart most likely won’t cash it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much does it cost to cash a check without a bank account?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe fees for cashing a check depend on where you are trying to cash a check.
