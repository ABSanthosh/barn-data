She's also a competitive weightlifter and powerlifter, so many of her travel involves going to meets (often fueled on the famous Hampton Inn waffles).She’s biked over the sea ice in the Arctic Circle, climbed to the top of the Eiffel Tower with all her carry-on bags during a 10-hour layover in Paris, hiked 25 miles in a day around Italy's Cinque Terre and biked the famous Hải Vân Pass in Vietnam. She hates relaxing.Craig Joseph, Lead WriterCraig lives to explore and is always looking for the next adventure. He’s redeemed millions of rewards to visit over 40 countries and enjoys teaching people how they can do the same.Craig loves figuring out creative ways to keep travel costs down so there’s more money to have fun in unique places. From cycling across the islands of southern Japan to snowboarding through Antarctic snow blasts on volcanoes in New Zealand, he’s your man for active and sporty travel ideas.Benjamin Din, Lead WriterBenjamin is a travel enthusiast who thrives on maximizing points and miles, elite status, and credit card perks to unlock unforgettable experiences — not just for himself, but for his friends and family too.Last year, he flew over 100 flights, exploring all six inhabited continents, (Antarctica is still on the bucket list!) experiencing everything from basic economy to international first class. You’ll often find him in a Star Alliance lounge, as he chases down his next big milestone: becoming a United Airlines million miler.Meghan Coyle, Editor and Smart Travel co-hostMeghan loves traveling with her family, including her mom, dad, and three younger sisters. She has now gotten all of her family and friends into using credit cards and loyalty programs to make travel more affordable and upgrade the experience.Meghan studied abroad in New Zealand in college, so she is always looking for beautiful, adventurous destinations with great hiking. These days, she’s using most of her points and miles on trips to destination weddings in Hawaii, Florida, Mexico, Scotland, Italy, and Australia.Claire Tsosie, Managing EditorClaire is a veteran credit cards and travel Nerd. She loves traveling with her husband and two kids. Her personal goal is to take four family trips every year. She uses points, miles and other credit card benefits to keep costs down.

Her love of travel and frugal nature led to a passion for credit card and loyalty rewards to subsidize trips.Erin is always planning her next adventure for her family of four using points and miles — sometimes flying in premium cabins, often staying in posh suites, always spending a small fraction of the retail price. Her young kids are the luckiest beneficiaries of her travel obsession and have visited 20 countries (and counting) before they turn 10.Subscribe to our free TravelNerd newsletter for inspiration, tips and money-saving strategies, delivered straight to your inbox.By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy.
