Today’s interview is with Stephen from Marketplace SuperHeroes, who sells on Amazon. Stephen used to work at a government job. On paper, it looked like a great gig. But deep down, he wanted more. More freedom, more time, and more purpose. That desire led him down the path of online business, and eventually, to selling on Amazon. Now, his Amazon business has passed the $1,000,000 mark annually, and he teaches others how to build successful reselling businesses too – even if they’re just getting started and only have a few hours a week.  In this interview, Stephen shares exactly how he did it, how much you can really make, and how beginners can follow the same simple system to start making money online. He answers questions such as: Is there really still room for new Amazon sellers?  How much can someone actually make selling on Amazon? What kind of items can you sell on Amazon?  What are some challenges a person may face by selling on Amazon? What happens to items that don’t sell? Plus more! If you’ve ever wanted to learn how to start a real Amazon business, this is a must-read!  Stephen also put together a free step-by-step guide: ​The Simple Amazon Side Hustle eBook​. It’s packed with tips to help you get started, what products to look for, and how to make your first sales – even with just a couple of hours a week. ​Click here to grab your free copy and start learning today!​ How I Quit My 9-5 And Made $1.4 Million Last Year Selling Products On Amazon If you want to learn how to start a business selling on Amazon, this interview is a great place to get started. 1. Let’s start with your story. What were you doing before Amazon, and how did this whole thing begin? Over 12 years ago now, I had what you’d probably call a “safe” job — working in a government role at the Mental Health Commission in Dublin, Ireland. Decent paycheck, good benefits, stability. But every lunch break, every quiet moment, I was Googling “how to make money online.” I didn’t want to be stuck in this “secure” job forever – because I felt like there was more. More freedom. More purpose. More possibility.  Of course, the internet will throw every scam imaginable at you when you search that stuff. Get-rich-quick “gurus,” crypto schemes, apps that promised passive income but paid you pennies for your time. I tried quite a few things. Most of it didn’t work. Then, a random conversation changed my life. A friend of my aunt’s was quietly crushing it with an eCommerce or physical products business. I didn’t hesitate. I drove across the country to meet him and ended up in his freezing cold warehouse (back then, you had to do all of this yourself – not anymore, thankfully!), learning everything I could about selling physical products online. It was hands-on, unglamorous, and the best crash course I could’ve asked for. I started with reselling existing brands on Amazon. It was a straightforward, simple way to learn the ropes and get quick wins. Over time, we expanded into private label (where you build your own branded products) and eventually launched Marketplace SuperHeroes to help others do the same. Fast forward a few years, and I now run the business with my sister and CEO, Lisa. We work with world-class educators in this space, and we’ve sold millions in product across Amazon marketplaces globally.  We now run an online education platform that’s helped nearly 10,000 people start their own Amazon businesses. In 2024, one of our own Amazon accounts cleared $1.4M in revenue. And 2025? It’s shaping up to be even bigger. But here’s the thing: you don’t need to create the next viral product or be a marketing genius to do this. You don’t even need to be on camera or come up with ideas on what to sell. You just need to understand how to sell simple, everyday items that people already want – and plug into Amazon’s incredible fulfillment system. That’s what we teach. And it works. 2. What does it actually mean to “sell on Amazon”? Can you explain this in beginner-friendly terms? Absolutely. Imagine this: you find a product that people are already buying — say, a specific brand of shoe, like Converse. You get a few boxes of those shoes at a discount from another store (either locally or online), and you send them to Amazon’s warehouses. Now here’s the magic: Amazon stores those products, lists them for you, handles customer service, ships them out when someone buys — they do all the “hard” stuff. You just focus on finding products that you can list at a profit on Amazon. That system is called Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) — and it’s what allows you to run a real business in your spare time. Think about what this means practically. When a customer places an order for your product, you don’t have to do anything.  You’re not rushing to pack boxes, standing in line at the post office, or answering customer service emails at 11 PM. Amazon handles all of that for you! We teach two main ways to get started: Reselling (Retail/Online Arbitrage)You find discounted items on websites like Walmart, Boots, or even clearance sections of online retailers — then list and sell them on Amazon for a profit. It’s beginner-friendly because: You can start small — even with $500 or less You don’t need to create a brand or deal with overseas suppliers You see results fast — sometimes in your first week! This model is what we’ll be talking more about in today’s blog post! Wholesale (Accelerate Model)Here, you buy branded products directly from domestic suppliers (for example, in the USA). You get permission to resell these items and typically get better pricing.  Then you list them on Amazon and aim to win a share of the Buy Box — this is the main “Add to Cart” section on a product page. When multiple sellers offer the same item, Amazon rotates who appears there throughout the day.  If you’re priced competitively and meet certain criteria, your offer gets featured — meaning you can make sales even if others are selling the same product. This is ideal once you’ve gotten some traction with reselling and want to scale faster. Our wholesale expert, Mike, runs this side of the training, and he’s brilliant. In both models, you’re not reinventing the wheel. You’re plugging into an existing ecosystem, solving real problems with products you know are already selling from big brands like Crayola, Fisher Price, and more, and taking your slice of the pie. Here’s an overview of what the process looks like… But if you’re a beginner? Kickstart is the perfect place to start. And Josh, our reselling expert (and my business partner), is the one who guides you step-by-step inside that program. Oh, and speaking of Kickstart, we put together a free e-Book recently that will teach you in-depth how this model works and what kind of results you can expect when you get started… Click here to get your free copy now! 3. Is there really still room for new Amazon sellers? Or is the market saturated? This is probably the #1 myth that keeps people from starting. And I get it — Amazon’s massive. But let me be clear: There has never been a better time to start. Why? Because Amazon is growing faster than ever. Over 60% of their product sales now come from third-party sellers — people like you and me. They need us to keep up with demand. And here’s the kicker: Amazon is a living, breathing marketplace. Inventory levels shift, prices fluctuate, and sellers come and go. There are always gaps — and those gaps are opportunities for smart sellers. In 2024 alone, we saw total beginners come in, find simple products like kitchen tools or haircare items, and start generating hundreds (even thousands) in monthly profit in a matter of weeks. Plus, the way we teach Amazon selling isn’t about guessing or “getting lucky.” It’s strategic. We use proven tools and methods to spot opportunities — products that people are buying, that don’t have enough competition, and that we can source for less than they sell on Amazon. So yes, there’s plenty of room. If you follow a system and treat it like a real business, the opportunities are wide open. 4. How much can someone actually make doing this? It depends — and I say that not to dodge the question, but because it really does depend on a few things: how much you invest, how consistently you work, and how well you follow the system. This isn’t one of these get rich quick things where I tell you you’re going to be a millionaire next month, and if I did, I’d hope you wouldn’t trust me very much. As I share these numbers, know this – we can’t and won’t promise that you’ll have the same results. Of course, results in any business may vary. That said, let’s talk real numbers. With our Kickstart Reselling method, we’ve seen: People start with $500–$1,000 and grow to $1,000–$2,000/month in profit pretty quickly Others reinvest and scale to $5,000–$10,000/month Some grow further and use profits to fund bigger inventory, eventually going full-time It’s a real business model that rewards consistency and smart decisions — but unlike most businesses, you can start seeing sales within weeks. In fact, here’s one of my favorite recent stories: “I sent my first products into Amazon in March 2024, and made my first sales just 3 days later. That was the proof I needed that this actually works. Since then, I’ve done over $8,300 in sales and I’m tracking toward $10k. There have been challenges, sure — but I’m learning, I’m selling, and I’m building something real.” — Nicole, Kickstart Reseller You can check out the full interview with Nicole below! Nicole’s story is such a great example of what happens when you follow a proven process. She didn’t go all-in on some trendy, risky product. She followed the steps, started small, and is now scaling up with confidence. We built this model specifically for people like Nicole — people who want something real, flexible, and practical. Whether your goal is an extra $1k/month or eventually going full-time, reselling on Amazon is one of the most accessible ways to get there. 5. How much time does this take each week? Can I do this with a full-time job? Absolutely — and a lot of our students do just that. We call this the 2-Hour Amazon Shortcut because most people can run this model in as little as 2 hours per day, or about 10–14 hours a week. That’s enough to: Find profitable products Order and send them to Amazon Monitor your account and track sales And since Amazon does the packing, shipping, returns, and customer service, you’re spending your time on the highest-value tasks: sourcing and strategy. You can build this around your life — early mornings, evenings, weekends. Some people even do it during lunch breaks at work. As you grow, you might choose to put in more hours or hire help. But to get started? A couple of hours a day is more than enough. 6. What kind of items can you sell on Amazon? And how do you find them? The short answer: many of the big brands that are already selling on Amazon — as long as you can buy it cheaper elsewhere. Here’s how we teach our students to find profitable products using our Kickstart Reselling method: Identify products with proven demandWe use specific tools and data points (like Best Sellers Rank, number of reviews, and estimated sales volume) to make sure the product is already selling well on Amazon. Look for price gapsThis is the core of the reselling model. You’re looking for everyday products that are being sold cheaper somewhere else — whether that’s Target, Walmart, Boots, or Best Buy. If it’s selling for $15 on Amazon and you can buy it for $7 elsewhere, that’s a solid lead. Check the competition We avoid listings where there are too many other sellers or where the price is likely to crash. Ideally, we want products where there are only a few sellers rotating in the Buy Box — the section where customers click “Add to Cart.” That’s how you make consistent sales. Calculate all your costsBefore buying anything, we teach you how to run the numbers properly. That includes product cost, Amazon’s fees, shipping, and any prep center charges — so you’re clear on your profit margin before you commit. Start small and testNever go all-in on a product right away. We teach you to test a small quantity, see how fast it sells, and then double down on the winners. This keeps risk low and confidence high as you build. Some hot categories? Health \u0026 personal care Home and kitchen Office supplies Toys Grocery items with strong demand Today, you might find a fitness accessory at a discount. Next week, it might be a cleaning product. The key is following the numbers, not your personal preferences. In our free eBook and bonus workshop, we dive deep into what products to sell, what sort of profits to expect, and how to find the best possible products to get started with.

Starting an Amazon reselling business through our Kickstart method is one of the most accessible online business models available today.  One of the reasons reselling is such a great starting point is the low upfront cost. You don’t need thousands of dollars or huge inventory commitments. Most people get started with $500–$1,000 and grow from there. Here’s a simple breakdown of the typical startup and ongoing costs: Amazon Seller Account – $39.99/month for the Professional plan (recommended) Initial Inventory – You can start testing with as little as a couple hundred bucks. Unlike private label, you don’t need to buy hundreds of units of a single product. Prep Center (optional) – If you’re not prepping products yourself, many sellers use a prep center to receive, inspect, label, and forward products to Amazon. Expect $1–$3 per item. Shipping to Amazon (if self-prepping) – $10–$30 per box, depending on weight/distance. Basic supplies – If prepping at home, you might need tape, boxes, and labels. Budget $50–$100. One of the biggest advantages of the Kickstart model is that you don’t need to go all-in on one product.  You can test several items in small quantities, see what sells, and scale up the winners. That keeps risk low and helps you build experience and confidence quickly. Many of our students see their first sales — and even their first profits — within just a few weeks of sending their first products into Amazon. 8. What are some challenges a person may face by selling on Amazon? What happens to items that don’t sell? Like any real business, reselling on Amazon comes with its ups and downs (but compared to most other online business models, these are a breeze to navigate!) The key is knowing what to expect — and how to handle it when things don’t go exactly to plan. Here are a few of the common challenges beginners face (and how we help you deal with them): 1. Picking the right products Not every item that looks profitable on paper ends up selling well in reality. That’s why we teach you to test small quantities first — no big risks, no guesswork. You’ll improve your product research skills with a little time and practice (and we have tools to help you speed up your progress massively). 2. Price competition Amazon is a dynamic marketplace. Prices can fluctuate based on demand and competition. We show you how to find products with enough margin to weather whatever may happen and how to know when to hold or adjust your price. 3. Inventory management You’ll learn how to balance having enough stock to keep selling — without tying up too much cash in products that move slowly. This becomes even more important during seasonal shifts. 4. Account health Amazon expects you to follow certain performance metrics (like order defect rate, cancellation rate, etc.). Luckily, FBA handles most of this for you — but we still help you stay compliant and keep your account in good standing. Remember, you’re testing small batches of multiple products, so if something doesn’t perform, it’s not a big setback. You can quickly pivot, learn from it, and keep moving. Over time, you’ll get better at picking winners and building systems that make everything smoother. These little bumps in the road? They’re just part of building a real, sustainable business. 9. Can you tell us more about your course? How does it actually help beginners? Absolutely. Our Kickstart Reselling program, led by our reselling expert (and my business partner) Josh, is built for total beginners. You don’t need experience, products, or tech skills. Here’s what you get: 8-week training: Step-by-step system to go from zero to first sales Sourcing Vault: Our personal list of websites to find profitable products Daily Deal Alerts: We even help you spot real-time opportunities Weekly coaching calls: Ask questions and get help from our team Private community: Meet other sellers, share wins, and get support Scaling tools: Learn how to outsource, scale, and turn this into a full-time business if you want It’s not fluff. We teach real, actionable strategies and walk you through every step. And while Kickstart focuses on the reselling model (where you find discounted products online and flip them for a profit on Amazon), we also offer advanced training for those who want to move into wholesale later on.  That’s led by our Wholesale expert, Mike, who’s amazing at helping people take things to the next level when they’re ready. But to be super clear: if you’re just starting out, Kickstart is the perfect place to begin. You’ll learn everything you need to make your first sales and build a business that fits around your life.

That keeps risk low and helps you build experience and confidence quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany of our students see their first sales — and even their first profits — within just a few weeks of sending their first products into Amazon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e8.
