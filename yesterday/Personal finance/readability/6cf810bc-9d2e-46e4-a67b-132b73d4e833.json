Learn what I think of this site in my Testerup Review. Are you looking to make extra income, all from your phone? Testerup is an app I recently tried where you can get paid to play games and answer surveys. I gave it a try, and in just one week, I earned $72.50 by completing easy tasks, mostly by playing games on my phone like Monopoly. If you’re looking for an easy side hustle you can do from your phone, this might be worth checking out. Click here to sign up for Testerup. Testerup Review Below is my Testerup review. Here are some of the games currently available to me on Testerup. What is Testerup? Testerup is a get-paid-to (GPT) app where users can earn real money by testing apps, completing offers, playing games, and answering quick surveys. It’s a German company that is available to those who are 18 years old and older and who live in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. This site is very popular too, with over 10,000,000 downloads! It’s free to sign up, and once you’re in, you can browse through a list of available tasks that show how much each one pays. For example, when I log in, it says I have 105 available offers, and I can earn $12,341.26 by completing them. Testerup pays you cash through PayPal as well, so you are earning real money while using this app. Many of the highest-paying tasks are phone games that reward you for reaching certain levels, making in-app purchases, or reaching goals. Some games can pay over $20 just for hitting milestones like level 200. Here are some examples of what you can get paid (at the time that I wrote this article, so it could be different from when you read this): $200 for playing Monopoly Go $262 for playing Coin Master $250 for playing Domino Dreams $188 for playing Solitaire Cash $226 for playing Word Collect $88 for playing Farmville $15.80 for playing Harry Potter $1.10 for answering a 2-minute survey Here is a screenshot from my phone that shows how much I could earn while playing Match Masters. When you reach a milestone, you get a checkmark. How does Testerup work? Signing up for Testerup is quick and easy. You can register with an email address or log in through Google. Once you’re registered, you’ll see a dashboard with tasks and the amount that you can earn. Here’s how it works: Sign up for Testerup by clicking here. Choose a task: These include games, surveys, and apps to test. Follow the task instructions: Some ask you to reach a certain level in a game or complete a form. Complete the offer: Make sure to do exactly what the task says so it tracks correctly. Get paid: Once verified, the reward is added to your account balance. Tasks are marked with their payout value, so you can prioritize the highest-paying ones first or you can even just look at these to see if it’s worth it for you. For example, some may require you to beat hundreds of levels, which may take a lot of time. After testing Testerup myself, I can say that it worked for me – I earned money and successfully cashed out through PayPal. Everything tracked perfectly, and I didn’t run into any problems. I’ll go more into my experience in the section below. Here is a screenshot of my Testerup earnings and payment proof. As you can see, I cashed out $72.50 to PayPal. How I made $72.50 playing games on Testerup I decided to try Testerup for a full week to see what it was like. Most of my time was spent playing games on my phone, including Monopoly Go and Match Masters. These games were fun and didn’t feel like work at all. I also completed three super short surveys that paid $1.10, $0.90, and $0.70 each. They took less than a minute to finish, which was a nice surprise. Altogether, I earned $72.50 in one week. I didn’t have to watch many ads, and the app itself was very easy to use. Now, I did spend many, many hours playing these games over the 7-day period in order to make the $72.50 – but the games were fun. So, if you already play a lot of games on your phone or if you are looking for a low effort side hustle, I do think this is an easy one. Everything tracked perfectly, and my progress updated in real time. Once I hit the $70 minimum payout threshold, I was able to cash out to PayPal. The money arrived within a day or so – no issues at all. I was honestly impressed. One thing to note: After cashing out, you do have to earn another $70 before you can request another payout. That’s something to keep in mind. Here’s a screenshot from Trustpilot showing Testerup reviews. Pros and cons of Testerup Here are the main pros and cons based on my experience: Pros: Free to use High-paying game offers (some over $200) Quick online surveys that pay surprisingly well Easy-to-use app PayPal cash payout Fast PayPal payout once you reach $70 No annoying ad overload Has a 4.1 out of 5 star rating on Trustpilot (with over 13,000 reviews), a 4.2 out of 5 star rating on the Google Play Store (with over 145,000 reviews), and a 4.1 out of 5 star rating on the App Store (with over 36,000 reviews). Cons: The $70 minimum payout is high and can take a while to reach. Must complete face verification to cash out. This is easy, but I have not had to do this before. Some tasks can take many, many hours to complete. You must reach $70 again before cashing out a second time (and all times after). No gift cards or bank transfers. Is Testerup worth it? Testerup worked well for me. If you enjoy playing mobile games and want a way to make some extra money, I think it’s a great option. It’s not passive income and does require some time to finish the tasks, but you can do everything from your phone while relaxing on the couch. If you already play games on your phone, why not get paid for it? I also liked that there weren’t a bunch of ads slowing everything down, and the platform was easy to use. Just be sure to: Read each task’s instructions carefully. Thankfully, the app does a great job of showing you the instructions before you get started with each task, and I thought that was really good to have. Stick to one account only. Complete the face verification step if you want to cash out. And remember, you’ll need to get to the $70 minimum withdrawal amount before you can withdraw any money, which might take longer for some users. Note: You do need to make sure that you have never downloaded the game, app, or done the task before. It has to be your first time if you want to earn rewards! Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about Testerup. Does the Testerup app really pay? Yes, Testerup does really pay as long as you follow the task instructions and meet all the requirements. I personally earned $72.50 in one week, mostly from playing games on my phone, and I successfully cashed out to my PayPal account. The key is to complete the tasks exactly as described and be sure to pass their face verification before requesting your payout. For me, I would download the game from the app, and then before playing it or spending any time on the game, I would make sure that it tracked successfully over on Testerup. Thankfully, they make this really easy to see so you don’t have to waste any time wondering if something will track. How much money can you earn on Testerup? The amount of money you can make on Testerup depends on how many tasks you complete and how fast you progress in games. Some users make over $100 by completing high-paying offers, while others may earn less depending on how much time they spend. For me, I earned $72.50 in one week playing games on my phone on Testerup. Why does Testerup pay a person to play games and test apps? Testerup pays people for two main reasons: 1) because Testerup is paid per signup and for getting people to play their games (the longer you play, the better), and 2) because companies want real feedback and data of their games. When you play a game or try out an app through Testerup, you’re helping developers see how users interact with it – what works, what doesn’t, and whether people actually enjoy it. Is there a fee to cash out on Testerup? There’s no fee to cash out via PayPal, but you must earn at least $70 first. Do you have to verify your identity with Testerup? Yes, you’ll need to complete a face verification before you can receive money from Testerup. They require this because they want to make sure that real people are using their app and that they are also paying a real person. How long does it take Testerup to pay out? After reaching the $70 minimum and submitting my cash-out request, I received my PayPal payout within about one day. The official terms say it can take 1 to 2 business days, and mine was fast. Just keep in mind that you’ll need to complete identity verification first, which may slow things down a little the first time. What if my task doesn’t track on Testerup? This didn’t happen to me, but it does happen with rewards sites sometimes. Always read the instructions carefully, and take screenshots as proof just in case. Then, you can reach out to the support team on Testerup to see what your next steps are. Is Testerup available worldwide? Testerup is not available in every country. Currently, it is available for users in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Is Testerup a scam? I do not think that Testerup is a scam. I created a private account so that I could fully test out the app for this Testerup review (and so that the company could not influence my account in any way). I was able to earn $72.50 in one week, and I had no tracking issues whatsoever. I also successfully cashed out my earnings to PayPal and had no issues. Testerup Review – Summary I hope you enjoyed my Testerup Review. If you’re looking for a fun and easy way to earn money on your phone, Testerup is worth trying. I made $72.50 in one week mostly by playing games I actually enjoyed, and the payout was easy. It’s not a way to get rich, but it’s a simple side hustle you can do from home. Just be mindful of the $70 payout threshold, which can take some time to reach. You can sign up for Testerup by clicking here. Have you tried Testerup before?

These games were fun and didn’t feel like work at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI also completed three super short surveys that paid $1.10, $0.90, and $0.70 each.

I personally earned $72.50 in one week, mostly from playing games on my phone, and I successfully cashed out to my PayPal account. The key is to complete the tasks exactly as described and be sure to pass their face verification before requesting your payout. For me, I would download the game from the app, and then before playing it or spending any time on the game, I would make sure that it tracked successfully over on Testerup. Thankfully, they make this really easy to see so you don’t have to waste any time wondering if something will track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much money can you earn on Testerup?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe amount of money you can make on Testerup depends on how many tasks you complete and how fast you progress in games. Some users make over $100 by completing high-paying offers, while others may earn less depending on how much time they spend. For me, I earned $72.50 in one week playing games on my phone on Testerup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy does Testerup pay a person to play games and test apps?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTesterup pays people for two main reasons: 1) because Testerup is paid per signup and for getting people to play their games (the longer you play, the better), and 2) because companies want real feedback and data of their games. When you play a game or try out an app through Testerup, you’re helping developers see how users interact with it – what works, what doesn’t, and whether people actually enjoy it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs there a fee to cash out on Testerup?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s no fee to cash out via PayPal, but you must earn at least $70 first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you have to verify your identity with Testerup?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes, you’ll need to complete a face verification before you can receive money from Testerup. They require this because they want to make sure that real people are using their app and that they are also paying a real person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow long does it take Testerup to pay out?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter reaching the $70 minimum and submitting my cash-out request, I received my PayPal payout within about one day. The official terms say it can take 1 to 2 business days, and mine was fast. Just keep in mind that you’ll need to complete identity verification first, which may slow things down a little the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if my task doesn’t track on Testerup?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis didn’t happen to me, but it does happen with rewards sites sometimes.
