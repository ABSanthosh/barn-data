Over the last 10 years, I’ve bought and sold a few RVs – a Class C, a diesel pusher, and a Class A gas motorhome. I’ve learned a lot from each sale, and one of the biggest lessons is this: where you choose to sell your RV can make a huge difference if you want to make the most money. Whatever your reason for selling – if you’re ready to upgrade, downsize, or just move on from RV life, figuring out where to sell your RV is a big decision that will impact how much money you can make and the amount of time you will spend. In today’s post, you’ll learn about the best places to sell an RV, tips for getting the most money, and answers to common questions I hear about selling an RV. Where To Sell Your RV Below are the best places to sell your RV and make money. This is a picture from when we traded in our first RV and bought our second. The process was easy because we already knew we wanted another RV. 1. Camping World Camping World is a well-known name in the RV world, and they do both trade-in and consignment options. They are currently buying 2012 and newer model year RVs, and you can start your quote by telling them your year, make, model, and trim. They also have a deal where they guarantee they will give you the best offer from any licensed RV dealer or they will pay you $1,000, which is pretty amazing so that you know you are getting the best price. If you decide to consign your RV, they have a big reach and will market your RV to buyers across the country. One of the biggest perks is that they handle a lot of the process for you, such as showing the RV, helping buyers with financing, and dealing with paperwork. So, it is nice that you don’t have to do all of that work. However, they do charge fees for consignment (they are doing all of that work after all!), so you will not get as much money as compared to selling it yourself. On average, their commission can range from 10% to 15% of the sale price, which is expensive, but it does make the process a lot easier since you won’t have to do much of anything yourself. 2. RV Trader RV Trader is one of the most popular websites for selling RVs. It’s an online marketplace where you can list your RV with photos, a description, and your asking price. A lot of people browse on RV Trader to look for RVs to buy, so there is a good chance that a potential buyer will find your RV listing here. They do charge a fee to list (it’s around $100 per month), and they have a few different packages. Basic listings are more affordable, and premium listings include features like priority placement and the option to upload more photos. The plus of RV Trader is that although you are doing more work (you have to create the RV listing), you do get to usually make more money because you are selling the RV yourself. For example, RV Trader says that: If your travel trailer is worth $34,950, you may only be able to trade it in at the RV dealership and get $26,450. That’s a difference of $8,500 for selling it yourself! If your Class A motorhome is worth $131,400, you may only be able to trade it in at the RV dealership and get $102,250. That’s a difference of $29,150 for selling it yourself. If your fifth wheel is worth $88,350, you may only be able to trade it in at the RV dealership and get $67,700. That’s a difference of $20,650 for selling it yourself. If your truck camper is worth $18,950, you may only be able to trade it in at the RV dealership and get $14,300. That’s a difference of $4,650 for selling it yourself. 3. RVT.com RVT.com is another dedicated RV selling platform. Like RV Trader, it’s focused on RVs only, which means the people visiting the site are already looking for what you’re selling. This niche audience helps filter out tire kickers and brings in buyers who are actually interested. They have different ad packages, with more exposure depending on what you choose. Their lowest package is $45.95, runs for 30 days, and includes 5 pictures of your RV. Their highest package is $206.95 and your listing will run until it is sold, plus you get unlimited pictures. 4. eBay Everyone has heard of eBay, so it can be a good place to sell your RV. You do get a lot more people who are just window shopping, but people from all over can see your listing, which is helpful. You can set a “Buy It Now” price or let people bid auction-style. 5. Facebook Marketplace Facebook Marketplace is one of the first places many people look when buying and selling used items, including RVs. It’s free to list and easy to use, so it can be a great first step for selling your RV and seeing if you have any interest. All you need is a Facebook account, and you can post detailed listings with photos and pricing. One of the benefits is that you can see if you have mutual friends with potential buyers or if they’re located nearby. However, the process is very DIY. You’ll be managing conversations, scheduling showings, and handling negotiations. 6. Facebook groups There are many RV-specific Facebook groups that allow members to post RVs for sale. These groups can have thousands of members, and buyers tend to be more knowledgeable about RVs and be more interested. For example, I currently have a Winnebago Revel (a sprinter van) and I am in the Facebook group for it. People list their RVs right in the Facebook group, and people who are interested in this specific RV (but don’t have it yet) are typically in the Facebook group and can buy it from the person directly. There are numerous listings for my same RV in the Facebook group, and there are thousands of people in the group – which makes for a very engaged audience! There was even one for sale just down the street for me, and I didn’t even know they were my neighbor until I saw the Facebook post with their RV for sale, ha! If you decide to post in a Facebook group, make sure to read the group rules. Most require a specific format for listings, like listing the price and location. 7. Local RV dealership Local dealerships many times do trade-ins, consignments, or even buy your RV outright. This is usually an easy way to sell quickly, especially if you’re also planning to buy a different RV from them. They’ll typically do a quick inspection, make you an offer, and take care of the paperwork. However, dealerships do need to make a profit, so they usually won’t pay you full market value. You might get 10% to 20% less than what you could make selling privately. That said, the convenience factor is huge. If your goal is a quick and easy transaction, working with a local dealer may be the best route. 8. Lazydays Lazydays is a large RV dealership with locations around the U.S., and they buy RVs for cash. They will pick up your RV, handle the paperwork, and pay you cash. They buy motorhomes, travel trailers, toy haulers, and fifth wheels that are within around 10 years old. 9. Good Sam Good Sam is known for its RV memberships, campground discounts, and roadside assistance, but they also have a department where you can sell or consign your RV (did you know that?!). They work with a network of RV dealers and can even give you an instant quote. 10. Craigslist Craigslist is a free site that works okay in some areas. You’ll want to be careful of scams, but if you take the right precautions, Craigslist can be a good choice for selling locally. You’ll want to write a detailed listing, include plenty of pictures, and meet buyers in a public place or at a safe location. Now, since Craigslist is free and really only targets a small area (your specific city or county), it typically does take a little longer to sell an RV on this site. It may be best to combine Craigslist with a few other methods in order to improve your reach. For example, you may decide to list your RV on Craigslist, but also list it on Facebook to maximize your free options. La Mesa paid cash for our RV and picked it up directly from this campsite. It was super easy, and we were very happy with the process! 11. La Mesa RV La Mesa RV is another popular dealership in the RV world, with multiple locations across states like California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Florida. I have personally traded in an RV as well as sold another RV for cash to La Mesa in the past, and they made the whole process super easy. For selling my RV for cash – everything was done over email or on the phone with their Cash for RVs program on their website. I just entered my RV information, like the make, model, year, and miles, along with my contact information, and they got back to me with a price. After we agreed on a price, they picked up the RV right from the RV spot it was in (they had a driver come) and wired me the cash. It was super easy, and they actually paid nearly the same amount that I had bought the RV from them for a couple of years before that – so it was a good deal. Bonus option: Rent out your RV If you’re not 100% sure about selling your RV (this is completely normal by the way!), another option to think about is renting it out instead. I know people who have rented out their RV on RVshare, and it’s a great way to earn extra income without fully letting go of your rig. RVshare is a rental platform (like Airbnb, but for RVs!) where you can list your RV for free, set your own rates and schedule, and rent it out to vacationers, road trippers, and even other RVers. They handle the RV insurance, roadside assistance, and payment processing, which makes the whole process much easier and safer than doing it all on your own. Some RV owners make thousands of dollars a year this way, and you still get to keep your RV for personal trips. If you’re not using your RV all the time, renting it out through RVshare could be a smart way to offset your costs or earn while you decide what to do long-term.

Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about selling your RV. What is the fastest way to sell an RV? The fastest way to sell an RV is usually through a dealership or consignment service like Camping World or La Mesa RV. These businesses already have buyers coming through the door and large online followings. While you might not make the most money, they make the entire process very easy. What is the best site to sell an RV online? RV Trader is one of the most popular websites for selling RVs online, and people use it all the time to list their RVs. Where can I sell my RV online for free? Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist are the most popular sites for selling an RV online without any listing fees. You can also use RV-related Facebook groups for even more targeted customers. These are great if you’re trying to sell locally and want to avoid costs. How much does Camping World charge to sell your RV? Camping World charges a consignment fee (if you consign your RV), which can vary based on your RV’s value and the location. On average, it’s around 10% to 15% of the final sale price. It’s a good idea to ask for a full breakdown before signing a consignment agreement with anyone. What documents do I need to sell my RV? You’ll need a few documents to complete the sale of your RV: The RV title (free of liens or with a lien release letter) A bill of sale Maintenance and repair records (these aren’t a requirement, but they are nice to have for potential buyers) Owner’s manual, if you have it Any extended warranty paperwork Also, make sure you check every space in your RV for any belongings of yours! When we sold our first RV, we forgot to check under the bed in the hidden compartment. We left a whole bunch of stuff, including a paddleboard. Thankfully, the dealership noticed right away and called us. Best Places To Sell Your RV – Summary I hope you enjoyed my article on the best places to sell an RV and make money. Selling your RV can feel overwhelming at first, but once you understand your different options, the process becomes much easier.

I’ve personally used several of the options on this list and found success with each, depending on what I needed at the time. I have sold 3 RVs over the years, and it’s been very painless each time.

You’ll want to be careful of scams, but if you take the right precautions, Craigslist can be a good choice for selling locally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll want to write a detailed listing, include plenty of pictures, and meet buyers in a public place or at a safe location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, since Craigslist is free and really only targets a small area (your specific city or county), it typically does take a little longer to sell an RV on this site. It may be best to combine Craigslist with a few other methods in order to improve your reach. For example, you may decide to list your RV on Craigslist, but also list it on Facebook to maximize your free options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" data-pin-description=\"La Mesa paid cash for our RV and picked it up directly from our campsite.

After we agreed on a price, they picked up the RV right from the RV spot it was in (they had a driver come) and wired me the cash. It was super easy, and they actually paid nearly the same amount that I had bought the RV from them for a couple of years before that – so it was a good deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBonus option: Rent out your RV\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re not 100% sure about selling your RV (this is completely normal by the way!), another option to think about is renting it out instead.
