  "text": "After three years of writing, rewriting, and refining, I’m thrilled to officially celebrate the launch of Millionaire Milestones: Simple Steps To Seven Figures! This book has been a true labor of love, not just for me, but for my family as well. It’s the product of countless early mornings, late nights, and weekends hunched over the keyboard, while also navigating the beautiful chaos of parenthood and everyday life. Each chapter represents years of financial experience, both wins and mistakes, distilled into clear, actionable steps that anyone can take to build wealth over time. I wrote this book to help people from all walks of life hit their first $1 million in net worth, without needing a lucky break or a six-figure salary. Whether you're just starting out in your career, navigating a midlife financial reset, or thinking about how to best guide your children toward financial independence, this book will serve as your practical, no-nonsense companion. The Making Of Millionaire Milestones: A Conversation With My Wife \u0026 Editor To mark the occasion, my wife and I recorded a special 30-minute podcast episode discussing the behind-the-scenes of creating Millionaire Milestones, what readers can expect, and some of the emotional ups and downs that came with the process. We talk candidly about what it took to stay committed, how we managed the juggling act as parents and partners, and why we believe this book can make a meaningful difference in people’s lives. You can listen to it below: If you’re curious about the deeper motivations behind writing the book, check out my earlier post here: Why I Wrote Millionaire Milestones: Easy Steps To Seven Figures A Heartfelt Thank You For Supporting Millionaire Milestones Since July 2009, I’ve published three free personal finance articles a week on Financial Samurai—over 2,500 posts and counting.

And if you’ve been able to build significant wealth from reading my work over the years, there’s no better way to pay it forward than by giving the gift of financial freedom through this book.
