When entrepreneurs buy an established, existing business, 75-85 percent succeed. We don’t hear about this path often. But maybe we should. This dramatic difference challenges conventional wisdom. The myth says that buying a company is “risker” than starting one. It also reveals a powerful truth about building wealth — the best opportunities often hide in plain sight. Think about it this way: When you buy an existing business, you’re not starting from scratch. You’re running something with a track record. There’s no need to burn through savings, hoping customers will show up. The customers are already there. The operations are already humming. The cash is already flowing. This flips the typical entrepreneurial playbook on its head. Instead of wondering if your idea will work, you’re starting with proof that it does. Then you can focus on the fun part: making a good business even better. Maybe that means upgrading systems, improving customer service, or finding smarter ways to operate. The differentiator isn’t just financial – it’s also psychological. If you start a business, your unique skill set is the vision that you bring to the company, and the direction that you set. But to succeed in business acquisition, you need a different skill set. You’re not inventing the next big thing. You’re developing an eye for value that others might miss. Essentially, you’re a value investor. I recently sat down with an expert who’s mastered this strategy. Codie Sanchez joined me at the Afford Anything studio in NYC to break down her playbook for acquiring profitable local businesses. ​She built a 9-figure holding company (yes, you read that right) by acquiring everyday companies. We’re talking about laundromats. Car washes. Dry cleaners. HVAC. Plumbing companies. Cleaning services. Dumpster rentals. These businesses aren’t glamorous. They’ll never grace the cover of Fast Company. But they share one crucial quality: They solve real problems that aren’t going away. Toilets will always need fixing. Offices will always need cleaning. Construction companies will always need equipment. While tech startups chase the next big thing, these Main Street businesses quietly generate steady cash flow by solving everyday problems. That creates a foundation for consistent cash flow that’s more accessible and reliable – and often more profitable over the long-term – than chasing unicorns in Silicon Valley. Codie has attracted 8 million followers (!!) across social media and 750,000 newsletter subscribers. ​In our conversation, we dive into: ✓ Why private equity firms are gobbling up Main Street businesses (spoiler alert: that’s where the reliable cash flow is!) ✓ The stats about business ownership and millionaire status ✓ How company ownership creates multiple income streams and lasting wealth Below, we break down the complete playbook. ​Here’s my full conversation with Codie",
