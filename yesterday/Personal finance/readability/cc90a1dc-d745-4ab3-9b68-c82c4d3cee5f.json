The Golden State’s volcanic peaks in the north and burly blocks of granite throughout the Sierra Nevada mountains give skiers and snowboarders access to a variety of terrain and some of the most epic slopeside views in the country. Most major ski resorts in California are also within a few hours drive to a major airport, making it an accessible place to shred from afar.I've been chasing powder for almost two decades, with over 60 days (and counting) on mountains throughout California. The state's geographic diversity has lead to some truly unique alpine experiences that have me constantly returning for more. Here are our picks for the best ski resorts in California. 1. Palisades Tahoe (and Alpine Meadows)Our pick for: Best overall California ski resortPalisades Tahoe, formerly known as Squaw Valley, is the largest ski resort in the Lake Tahoe area. The terrain at Palisades is fast and steep, bolstered by remarkable views of North Lake Tahoe. Though there are trails for every skill level, the area is really known for its unique topography, including steep chutes and cliffs. A lift ticket to Palisades Tahoe also provides access to nearby Alpine Meadows ski resort, which is accessible by bus or the base-to-base gondola. That extra access helps spread out crowds over 6,000 acres of skiable area.Both Palisades Tahoe and Alpine Meadows are part of the Ikon Ski Pass, which provides access to a collection of ski resorts around the world.Once you’re done bombing down the hill, revel in après-ski drinks while sharing the day’s triumphs and failures at dozens of bars and restaurants in Palisades Village. Additionally, there are amenities available in the village to keep any non-skiers in your party entertained throughout the day.My favorite lodging option around Palisades Tahoe is the Everline Resort and Spa. The property is a Category 8 hotel in the World of Hyatt program, with free night redemptions ranging between 35,000 and 45,000 points. That’s a lot of points, but ski trips are expensive, and using points can be a good way to hold on to cash. The easiest way to earn a slug of Hyatt points for free stays is through the World of Hyatt Credit Card or through a travel card that earns Chase Ultimate Rewards®.2. Kirkwood Ski ResortOur pick for: Best terrain and snow in CaliforniaPowder days at Kirkwood are what dreams are made of. Located about 40 minutes south of South Lake Tahoe and at a higher elevation than surrounding resorts, the snow is drier and more abundant than almost anywhere in the state. The steep-and-deep factor makes Kirkwood not only my favorite mountain for snowboarding in California, but one of my favorites in the United States.The resort belongs to the Epic Ski Pass, which can save you money over purchasing a daily lift ticket. There’s no mega-resort or city-like village at the base of Kirkwood and it’s harder to access than the ski areas right on Lake Tahoe. That combined with the terrain, which is suited for advanced to expert riders, helps keep the crowds down. I don’t think I’ve ever waited more than 15 minutes in a lift line at Kirkwood. However, the lifts are older and painfully slow once you head up the mountain.There are quaint ski-in/ski-out accommodations near the resort, but the surrounding area has more of a “mom-and-pop” feel than what you’ll find elsewhere around Tahoe. That means there aren’t many après-ski options (though there are a few). If you aren’t able to snag a hotel or short-term rental near Kirkwood, your best option is to look in South Lake Tahoe or across the border in Stateline, Nevada.3. Mammoth MountainOur pick for: Best apres-ski and longest ski season in California.Mammoth Mountain is the most balanced ski resort in California, with beginner to expert runs crossing over 3,500 acres of skiable terrain. Located in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains, Mammoth is the highest elevation ski resort in the state. That elevation allows lifts to run from early winter through summer during a good snow season. (In 2017, the resort was open through mid-August.)Mammoth belongs to the Ikon Ski Pass, so the long season can lead to a lot of late-season value for pass holders.Whether you’re learning how to strap in or you're bombing groomers, surfing bowls or playing in the terrain park, the expansive resort offers something for everyone. Unfortunately, that mass appeal can lead to congestion on the hill and big wait times for a lift, especially on days when the upper mountain closes due to wind.Mammoth’s sprawling footprint is home to an abundance of apres-ski options, including regular weekend parties on the Canyon Lodge sundeck. There are lots of options to stay near Mammoth, ranging from ski-in/ski-out lodges to more basic accommodations. The Westin Monache Resort, part of the Marriott Bonvoy program, is one of the few options for using points near the resort. However, since Marriott uses dynamic pricing, the number of points required for an award stay will fluctuate based on the cash price.Marriott Bonvoy Bold® Credit CardMarriott Bonvoy Bevy™ American Express® CardMarriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® CardMarriott Bonvoy Business® American Express® Card• 3 Marriott Bonvoy® points per $1 at participating Marriott Bonvoy hotels.• 2 points per $1 on grocery stores, rideshare, select food delivery, select streaming and internet, cable and phone services.• 1 point per $1 on all other eligible purchases.• 6 Marriott Bonvoy® points per $1 at participating Marriott Bonvoy hotels.• 4 points per $1 on up to $15,000 a year in combined purchases at U.S. supermarkets and at restaurants worldwide (including takeout and delivery in the U.S).• 2 points per $1 on all other eligible purchases.Terms apply.• 6 Marriott Bonvoy® points per $1 at participating Marriott Bonvoy hotels.• 3 points per $1 at restaurants worldwide and on flights booked directly with airlines.• 2 points per $1 on all other eligible purchases.Terms apply.• 6 points per $1 at participating Marriott Bonvoy hotels.• 4 points per $1 on worldwide dining, U.S. gas stations, on wireless telephone services purchased directly from U.S. service providers and on U.S. purchases for shipping.• 2 points per $1 on all other eligible purchases.Terms apply.Earn 30,000 Bonus Points after you spend $1,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.

Each Free Night Award has a redemption level up to 50,000 Marriott Bonvoy® points, for a total potential value of up to 150,000 points, at hotels participating in Marriott Bonvoy®. Certain hotels have resort fees. Terms apply.4. Heavenly Ski ResortOur pick for: Best view from the slopesBluebird days at Heavenly feel like you’re skiing inside a Bob Ross painting. With awe-inspiring vistas of Lake Tahoe, endless glades for tree skiing and wide-open groomers, Heavenly provides an on-mountain experience like nowhere else. I’ve snowboarded all over the world, and bouncing through deep powder against the blue background of Lake Tahoe is truly unique.Straddling the California and Nevada border in South Lake Tahoe, Heavenly caters to intermediate skiers, but even experts will find technical, steep terrain in Killebrew Canyon. There are beginner runs, but they’re isolated to a small area on the lower mountain. That means warmer conditions, lower-quality snow and poorer views than you’ll find at higher elevations.Heavenly belongs to the Epic Ski Pass, which can save you a ton of money over paying the eye-popping daily lift ticket price that can run north of $250. Heavenly Village is located at the base of the mountain and offers plenty of options for après-ski, with lots of bars and restaurants only a short walk from the gondola. The village also contains numerous luxury accommodations. For the more budget-minded, travel a short distance outside the village to find hostels and cheaper accommodations, including a casino across the border in Nevada.5. NorthstarOur pick for: Best family-friendly ski resortFamilies and beginner-to-intermediate skiers searching for picture-perfect groomers and gentle tree runs should look no further than Northstar. Located just north of Lake Tahoe, the resort is also home to some of the best terrain parks in the state. I’ve been to Northstar a few times and would describe it as “mellow.” Guests won’t get the mind-blowing views of Heavenly or the white-knuckle runs of Palisades Tahoe. But they will get well maintained trails that are conspicuously marked and a good selection of (very expensive) bars and restaurants. There are also trail maps on all the ski-lift bars, so even first-timers will never get too lost.Northstar belongs to the Epic Ski Pass, which could be a good option to save on the staggering per-day lift ticket price, which can approach $300.Located mid-mountain at Northstar is the nicest ski-side lodging in California — the Ritz Carlton Lake Tahoe. The 5-star hotel offers ski-in/ski-out access and a variety of restaurants and entertainment options. You can use Marriott Bonvoy points for your stay, but the number of points for a free night will vary depending on the cash price (which can be very expensive).For a more affordable ski vacation, check out nearby Truckee, California, for significantly cheaper food, bar and lodging options.6. Big Bear Mountain Ski ResortOur pick for: Best ski resort near Los AngelesThe best option for Angeleno powderhounds is Big Bear Mountain Ski Resort. Located on Bear Lake outside of Los Angeles, the small ski resort is built for beginner-to-intermediate riders and terrain park enthusiasts. It doesn’t offer the best snow or terrain, but it’s easily accessible from the city. A pass to Bear Mountain also provides access to Snow Valley and Snow Summit ski areas. Those resorts have more mellow terrain but typically shorter lift lines, though proximity to Los Angeles can mean long lift lines at each resort if conditions are good, especially on weekends. You can access the Bear Mountain Resorts with an Ikon Ski Pass. This could be an especially good deal if you live in Los Angeles and have the flexibility to get away during the week, as the lift lines will be substantially shorter.The best après-ski options are in Big Bear Lake, where there are also many hotels, including Hampton Inn and Home2 Suites properties. These Hilton hotels make it easy to burn points for free stays, leaving more money in your pocket for gas, lift tickets or new gear. How to maximize your rewards",
