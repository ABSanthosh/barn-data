  "description": "Nick and his wife have $100,000 to invest, but they’re worried about the volatility of the current stock market. Should they look into alternative investments such as private equity? Even though Roth IRAs come with tax-free withdrawals in retirement, Josh is worried about his tax bracket going up and neutralizing the benefits. Is he right to be concerned? The retirement portion of Cindy’s financial three-legged stool is set, and she’s now focused on her taxable brokerage. What investment strategy will allow her to be work optional in 10 years? Former financial planner Joe Saul-Sehy and I tackle these questions in today’s episode. Enjoy!",
