NerdWallet, Inc. does not offer advisory or brokerage services, nor does it recommend or advise investors to buy or sell particular stocks, securities or other investments.Dasha Kennedy — known online as @thebrokeblackgirl — learned about finances on the job. She was a default counselor at a bank after graduating high school. When she became a mom at 19, she admits she wasn’t thinking much about the future. “What I knew about motherhood early on was just, you’ve got to make ends meet,” Kennedy says. “It was just rooted in survival.” When her finances began to improve, she finally had room to breathe, think and plan. She started documenting her financial journey in a Facebook group in 2017 and now she has followers on Instagram and other platforms as well. In March 2025, she published her first book, “Moving Beyond Broke: The Power of Perseverance in Personal Finance.” I like Kennedy’s approach to money management because it’s inclusive and creative, blending personal experience with practical tools. Her gift is her ability to frame budgeting as a pathway to capacity, rest and joy. I reached out to Kennedy about how she balances financial responsibility without losing sight of the little luxuries that make life feel special. Here’s what she had to say.Responses have been edited for length and clarity.Q: What does being “bougie on a budget” mean to you, and how have you embraced this mindset in your own finances?A: To me, being bougie on a budget is about holding dual truths. I like nice things, but I don’t like financial stress. So I find ways to make my life feel good without doing the most. That might mean fresh flowers from the grocery store, a solo lunch at a cute café, or taking the long way home just because I like the view. Luxury isn’t always a price tag. It’s peace, it’s ease, it’s being able to say “yes” to what makes me feel good without regretting it later.Q: What are your top three go-to tips for living well without overspending?A: (1) Make a list before you go anywhere, even the convenience store; (2) Romanticize your routines, doing laundry with a candle lit just hits different; and (3) Have a “joy fund.” A small amount set aside every month just to make life sweeter.Q: How do you recommend people balance indulging in small luxuries while still working toward bigger financial goals? And how do you do this in your personal life?A: I treat small luxuries like seasoning. A little goes a long way. You don’t have to go full-blown spa weekend to feel cared for, sometimes it’s a new journal, a walk with your favorite playlist, or silk pillowcases on sale. I budget for joy no matter what. I build it into my plan like I do bills. That way I don’t feel guilty or impulsive when I want to treat myself.Q: If someone wants to glow up financially this year, where should they start? What’s one habit you swear by?A: Track your money, even if it’s difficult. Know what’s coming in, what’s going out, and what story your bank account is telling you. That habit changed everything for me. You can’t fix what you won’t face.Q: How can people change their money habits without feeling like they’re “missing out” or falling behind their peers?A: Redefine what progress looks like for you. Not Instagram. Not your group chat. If your habits are moving you toward peace, that’s a win. Q: What advice do you have for someone who wants to start investing but feels intimidated or like they “don’t make enough” yet?A: Start small and start now. I don’t care if it’s $10 a week. Consistency matters more than the amount. I always say investing isn’t just about money, it’s a mindset shift. You’re saying, “I believe in my future enough to plant seeds now.” That’s powerful.Q: What are some investing habits that helped you go from surviving to building wealth? Any lessons you learned the hard way?A: Automate it. That’s my No. 1. When I waited to “feel ready,” I never felt ready. So I set it and forget it. I also check in with myself every month. Can I add more? Am I spending out of boredom? That helped me course-correct without guilt. Hard lesson? Thinking I had to pick the perfect investment. I wasted time overthinking. Now I keep it simple, index funds, and relax.Q: What’s your best money advice for someone who’s just started earning six figures but isn’t sure how to build long-term wealth?A: Pause. Don’t let the new income rush you. Get clear on your values. Build a budget that reflects who you are and what you want. Max out your retirement contributions if you can. Pay off high-interest debt. And please, don’t get trapped in trying to “look” like a six-figure earner. Build quietly if you have to. Flex later.Q: There’s often pressure on social media to look successful. How do you help people push past appearances and focus on real financial stability?A: I remind people that looking rich and being free are not the same. Real wealth is options. Real wealth is rest. Real wealth is being able to say no and mean it. I help people build lives they don’t need to escape from, not just lifestyles that look good online.",
