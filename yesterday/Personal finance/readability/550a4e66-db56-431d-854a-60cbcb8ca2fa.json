President Roosevelt first made Columbus Day a national holiday in 1934, and Americans celebrated it every October 12th. Then, in 1972, President Nixon changed the day of the holiday to the second Monday in October. In modern times, some schools observe this holiday and are closed. If you and the kids are out and about on that day, you may wonder, “Is Target closed on Columbus Day, too?”Columbus Day ControversyColumbus Day is a federal holiday, which means government offices close on that day.
