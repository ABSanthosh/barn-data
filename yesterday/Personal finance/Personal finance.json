    "link": "https://affordanything.com/586-money-doubles-every-10-years-and-most-people-never-notice-with-scott-yamamura/",
    "description": "If you are a complete beginner at finances, or if you know someone who is, this episode is for you. The biggest hurdle for beginners? Money seems complex and intimidating. But Scott Yamamura, author of Financial Epiphany, explains personal finance doesn't have to be complicated. He breaks compound interest into three easy-to-grasp frameworks: 1. Money as a Multiplying Ability: Just like athletes have peak physical abilities in their 20s, your money has its greatest multiplying power when you're young. At age 22, every dollar invested can multiply 16 times by retirement (assuming a 40-year career and 7.2 percent returns). 2. The Doubling Framework: Money can double approximately every 10 years with average market returns. This explains why a dollar invested at 22 becomes $2 by 32, $4 by 42, $8 by 52, and $16 by 62. 3. The Halving Concept: With each decade that passes, your money's multiplying power gets cut in half. This is the inverse of the above idea. Scott shares how these simple frameworks helped him front-load his son's college savings. \"We can stop now because it's going to double,\" he said. For beginners struggling with analysis paralysis, Scott offers a Rubik's Cube analogy: You don't need to understand all 43 quintillion possible combinations to solve it — you just need one simple method to get started. Similarly, you don't need to master every financial concept to begin investing. The most important step is just to get started. You can learn the complexities later, but starting early gives your money more time to grow. Scott also emphasizes finding your \"why\" — a purpose bigger than just accumulating wealth. He shares a moving story about a man named Ernie who funded his mission trip to Sierra Leone, showing how money can be used to make a profound difference in people's lives.",

    "description": "I’m still here! I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",
