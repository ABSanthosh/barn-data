    "description": "I’m still here! I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",

    "description": "Brian and Michael, both 34, live with their two cats in central Connecticut. Michael works as a project coordinator for a state behavioral health agency serving young people and has a side job as an advocate and disability leadership coordinator. Brian is a quality assurance manager for a state-run hospital. The couple’s been together since 2013 and looks forward to celebrating their 10-year anniversary in November. While Brian and Michael have achieved a lot, they feel as though their debt and lack of home ownership is holding them back. They’d like our advice on how to unlock this next level of adulting and, crucially, how to be permanently debt-free. What’s a Reader Case Study? Case Studies address financial and life dilemmas that readers of Frugalwoods send in requesting advice. Then, we (that’d be me and YOU, dear reader) read through their situation and provide advice, encouragement, insight and feedback in the comments section.

    "link": "https://affordanything.com/harvard-negotiation-expert-why-conflict-avoidance-costs-you-more-than-you-think/",
    "description": "Imagine you're about to ask your boss for a raise. Your stomach tightens. You've rehearsed what to say, but doubt creeps in. Should you be more assertive? More understanding of company constraints? Bob Bordone, who has taught negotiation for 25 years including 21 years at Harvard Law School, joins us to explain why you don't have to choose between empathy and assertiveness. In fact, combining them is key to successful negotiations. \"It might feel like a tension, but it's not an actual one,\" Bordone explains. \"I can fully appreciate what you're feeling without ever giving anything up in a negotiation.\" Bordone breaks down his three-part preparation framework: 1. Mirror work: Identify the different sides of yourself in a negotiation — the empathic side that understands company constraints, the assertive side that knows you deserve recognition, and perhaps an anxious side worried about finances. 2. Chair work: Give each side a voice through role-playing exercises, literally sitting in different chairs to embody each perspective. 3. Table work: Bring these voices into the actual negotiation in an authentic way that doesn't make the other person feel attacked. He also introduces fascinating concepts like \"conflict recognition\" — how quickly we perceive something as a conflict — and \"conflict holding\" — our comfort with leaving conflicts unresolved. These differences often cause relationship problems when we're unaware of them. \"My best friend and I might debate over Flaming Hot Cheetos for 25 minutes. For me, with high conflict recognition, it's completely fun. I go home and sleep like a baby,\" Bordone says. \"For someone with low conflict recognition, they might think, 'That was horrible. Did I hurt the relationship?'\" When someone tries to shut down your request with policy (\"that's just how we do things here\"), Bordone recommends what he calls the \"Wizard of Oz tactic\" — asking a few more questions rather than immediately accepting defeat. The skills you develop asking for a raise transfer to other challenging conversations — from family inheritance discussions to political disagreements with colleagues. Bordone emphasizes that conflict isn't something to avoid but rather a normal part of relationships. The question isn't whether we'll have conflict, but how we handle it when it inevitably arrives.

    "link": "https://affordanything.com/590-small-cap-showdown-paul-merriman-vs-dr-karsten-jeske-battle-with-millions-hanging-in-the-balance/",
    "description": "In the left corner, we have Paul Merriman, the seasoned finance veteran weighing in at 183 pounds. In the right corner, Dr. Karsten Jeske, the scrappy newcomer at 208 pounds. The bell rings, and the small cap value debate begins. This episode features a financial boxing match between two investment heavyweights with dramatically different perspectives. Paul Merriman champions diversification through the efficient frontier, which means adding small cap value to your portfolio. Dr. Karsten Jeska has \"thrown cold water\" on this approach, favoring simpler strategies like \"VTSAX and chill.\" The stakes are high — we're talking potentially millions of dollars in your retirement account over decades. Merriman argues that history shows clear evidence for small cap value's premium. From 2000 to 2009, small cap value outperformed the S\u0026P 500 in all but one year, compounding at 10 percent while the S\u0026P 500 returned negative 1 percent. He believes this pattern will continue, creating a powerful diversification effect when combined with broader market indexes. Jeske counters that small cap value's outperformance is mostly \"front-loaded\" in history, happening before anyone knew about it. Since 2006, small cap value has underperformed. He argues that once an advantage becomes widely known, it disappears in an efficient market. Adding small cap value might even be \"di-worsification\" — increasing complexity without improving returns. The debate expands beyond small cap value to touch on: • Active vs. passive investing strategies • Market timing vs. buy-and-hold approaches • Simplicity vs. complexity in portfolio construction • The role of faith vs. evidence in investment decisions While both experts disagree about small cap value's future, they agree on fundamentals: invest early, stay invested for the long term, and understand that no one can predict markets with certainty. What starts as a technical debate evolves into a philosophical discussion about evidence, probability, and the limits of our knowledge — all with millions of retirement dollars hanging in the balance.",
