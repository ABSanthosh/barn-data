    "description": "Enrollment for Your First Rental Property is open! affordanything.com/enroll ____________________________ Today's question is different. There's something special about it — and you'll understand why in a moment. An 84-year-old listener left us a voicemail about his struggle to break free from mortgage debt. He and his 83-year-old wife need to move from their two-story townhouse because they can’t climb the stairs any longer. They found a single-story ranch house that fits their needs perfectly — except for one detail: it carries a crushing $4,200 monthly mortgage payment. They do have one potential escape route from this debt: selling their Florida condo, a vacation retreat that they haven't visited in years due to mounting chronic health challenges. But Hurricanes Milton and Helene ravaged their building last year. The storms spared their unit but destroyed the lobby and submerged their car in floodwater. The devastation slashed $100,000 from their property's value overnight. Now they face an agonizing decision: Should they accept this massive loss and sell the condo to free themselves from debt? Or would selling now, after such a steep drop in value, mean locking in their losses? Joe and I have answered hundreds of questions from our listeners over the years. But this question is special. It comes from my Dad. ___________________ Here’s the transcript of my father’s full question: Hi Paula and Joe, My name is Prahlad. I am 84 years old, and my wife is 83. We live in a two-storied townhouse in Atlanta and also own a two-bedroom condo on the beach as a second home in Clearwater, Florida. Recently, we purchased a one-storied ranch home in Atlanta so that we don’t have to go up and down the staircase at this old age. Our condo in Clearwater is on the 9th floor of the 14 storied building. We love the condo with views of the Gulf of Mexico and the Bay. However, we have not been able to visit it for a long time due to our underlying health conditions. We purchased the condo for $400,000 in 2015 and it was estimated to have appreciated to $800,000 in 2022. Since then, the price was estimated to come down to $775,000 in the Spring 0f 2024. As you know, this area was hit by two major hurricanes Helene and Milton in September and October last year. The lobby of the building was flooded with extensive damage and it is still under construction. The parking area under the roof was also flooded and our car was totaled. Fortunately, our condo did not suffer any damage. There has not been any significant real estate buy and sell activities in this neighborhood since it was hit by the hurricanes last year. My real estate agent estimates that the current value of the condo is $700,000. This building has been preparing for a major renovation of the plaza deck for the past few years, and we or the future owner anticipate to be assessed a large amount – maybe $30,000 – for the renovation. We were hoping that we could sell the condo and pay off the mortgage for the ranch home we recently purchased in Atlanta, and be debt free. What do you think – should we sell it now or wait until some later time – maybe until next year? Your advice would be highly appreciated. Thank you both for what you do.",

    "link": "https://affordanything.com/580-treasury-tantrums-arctic-routes-and-mckinleys-ghost/",
    "description": "\"If you want to understand what's happening in the economy, look at bonds,\" begins today's episode, where we explore how the bond market acts as a crystal ball for economic trends. The bond market has been sending some clear signals lately. Interest rates remain elevated, with 10-year Treasury yields about 1 percent higher than their September 2024 low. After a challenging 2024 where bond returns flattened to just 1.18 percent, both the U.S. and U.K. are seeing historically high yields. We break down what's driving these changes and explain key concepts like term premium — the extra return investors demand for holding longer-term bonds. The Federal Reserve's recent moves are shaping this landscape. After cutting rates by 1 percent between September and December 2024, Fed officials are now signaling a more cautious approach, wanting to see further inflation decline before considering additional cuts. Then we explore why President William McKinley is suddenly relevant again. McKinley, whose term began in 1897, was known for his imperialist expansion and love of tariffs. His presidency marked the end of what historians call \"the long 19th century\" — a period from the French Revolution to World War I that transformed global society. The episode then turns to what some are calling the \"Cold Rush\" — the race to claim influence in the rapidly changing Arctic. With ice melting four times faster than global averages and the potential for ice-free Arctic days by 2030, nations are competing for new shipping routes and access to resources. We examine three emerging paths: the Northern Sea Route along Russia's coast, the North-West Passage along North America, and the Transpolar Sea Route across the North Pole. Finally, we dive into an overlooked story: the global tax war. In 2021, 136 countries agreed to establish a 15 percent minimum corporate tax rate to prevent profit-shifting to tax havens. While the U.S. already exceeds this minimum with its 21 percent domestic rate, implementation faces challenges due to different methodologies for calculating tax bases and recent political developments that could affect its future.",

I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either.
