I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",

    "link": "https://affordanything.com/563-what-the-crypto-shift-means-for-your-money-with-tatiana-koffman/",
    "description": "Bitcoin is hitting new all-time highs. Is this just another bull cycle, or are we witnessing a fundamental shift in how the world thinks about money? That's the question at the heart of our conversation with Tatiana Koffman, General Partner at Moonwalker Capital and author of \"The Myth of Money.\" Koffman joins us to explain why Bitcoin might be considered \"digital property\" rather than just a currency. She breaks down how Bitcoin derives its value from mathematical scarcity – similar to how gold becomes harder to mine over time, Bitcoin becomes more difficult and expensive to create every four years through events called \"halvings.\" The conversation moves through several key developments in cryptocurrency. We discuss the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs and how traditional financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase (whose CEO Jamie Dimon once openly criticized crypto) are now embracing these products. Koffman shares insights about crypto adoption worldwide, from El Salvador's experiment with Bitcoin as legal tender to Dubai's emergence as a crypto hub. When discussing Africa's cryptocurrency landscape, Koffman explains how Nigeria's unstable banking system has driven crypto adoption, with many young people using decentralized exchanges to participate in global markets. She describes how some Nigerians have built significant wealth starting from nothing, using \"airdrops\" (free tokens given to early adopters) to begin trading. The interview includes a debate about inflation rates and economic data reporting, with Koffman expressing skepticism about official figures, while I push back on claims made without supporting evidence. Koffman also explains different categories of crypto investments, distinguishing between Bitcoin as a potential store of value and what she calls \"meme coins\" – speculative assets she compares to gambling. She provides context about stable coins, particularly USDC and Tether, and their role during the Silicon Valley Bank collapse. For those interested in investing in cryptocurrency, Koffman suggests starting with exposure to Bitcoin through regulated platforms like Coinbase or ETFs, while emphasizing the importance of proper security measures. She explains concepts like \"cold wallets\" and \"seed phrases,\" comparing them to different levels of bank security. Looking ahead, Koffman discusses cryptocurrency's potential role in reducing dependence on the U.S. dollar, particularly in developing economies, while acknowledging the challenges of creating stable alternative currencies. Find Koffman's weekly newsletter at mythofmoney.com or follow her on Twitter and Instagram @TatianaKoffman.",

    "link": "https://affordanything.com/562-the-secret-psychology-of-successful-negotiators-with-matt-schultz/",
    "description": "More than 90 percent of people who ask to get their credit card annual fee reduced are successful. Yet most people never ask. Why? They assume the answer will be no. Matt Schultz, the author of “Ask Questions, Save Money, Make More,” joins us to explain the psychology and tactics behind successful negotiation. The key insight: companies want to keep your business. Banks, employers, and service providers invest in long-term relationships because it's more profitable than constantly finding new customers. This gives you more leverage than you might think. For credit cards, Schultz points out that calling the retention department directly (rather than general customer service) often leads to better results. He shares his own experience of getting his $600 annual fee cut in half just by making a yearly call. With mortgage negotiations, Schultz suggests getting quotes from 3-5 lenders on the same day, since rates change frequently. A quarter-point rate reduction on a $360,000 mortgage saves $20,000 over the life of the loan. The fees themselves can differ by $5,000 between lenders. When it comes to workplace negotiations, Schultz recommends keeping a weekly log of your accomplishments. Note both your regular duties and times you went above and beyond. This creates a strong foundation for salary discussions. The most effective negotiations frame requests as win-win scenarios. Instead of just asking for tuition reimbursement, explain how additional education will help you contribute more to the company. Rather than demanding a lower rent, offer to sign a longer lease that reduces the landlord's vacancy risk. Schultz emphasizes building relationships during negotiations. The person at the call center has likely dealt with angry customers all day. Being pleasant and making a human connection can lead to better outcomes. The interview also covers negotiating with family members about money, choosing when to negotiate versus pay full price (like at charity shops or with small businesses), and how to time requests effectively. The common thread: success comes from understanding the other party's interests and finding ways to align them with your own. This episode will show you how to save hundreds — or thousands — in your regular spending, simply by asking.",
