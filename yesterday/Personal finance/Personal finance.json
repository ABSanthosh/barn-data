    "description": "This is the third and final episode in a three-part series. Dr. Brad Klontz and Adrian Brambila join us to share 21 harsh truths about building wealth. This episode focuses on the final 11 harsh truths, following up on their previous conversations about the first 10 harsh truths. The conversation begins with a key distinction: poor people buy stuff, while rich people buy time. They explain how wealthy people focus on building passive income streams rather than trading hours for objects. Brambila shares how he learned this lesson personally, discussing his pickleball court purchase through investment income rather than active work hours. The duo challenges common assumptions about luxury brands, arguing that people who constantly show off designer items are usually compensating for insecurity. Klontz shares his own experience of buying an expensive watch early in his career to prove his success. They examine whether college, marriage, and homeownership are necessary for wealth building. While data shows these traditional paths often lead to higher net worth, they acknowledge these aren't the only routes to financial success. On the topic of retirement, both guests argue that completely stopping work can be psychologically harmful, sharing examples of successful people who stayed active well into their later years. They break down specific money-saving strategies like getting roommates, using public transportation, and cutting your own hair. Brambila demonstrates how women can cut their own hair during the interview. The discussion covers specific side hustle opportunities, with detailed explanation of how to make money doing Amazon product reviews. Brambila shares how his videos have generated significant income, including $2,000 in a single day during Black Friday. They address money myths about credit cards, particularly the misconception about carrying balances to improve credit scores. Real examples and personal stories illustrate their points. Klontz shares how his 11-year-old son is making $5,000 monthly doing Amazon reviews, while Brambila discusses living in a van while earning six figures to demonstrate that wealth isn't about outward appearances. The episode concludes by connecting financial security to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, explaining how building wealth enables higher-level personal growth and positive impact",

    "description": "Dr. Brad Klontz and Adrian Brambila join us for part two of their three-part series on \"harsh truths\" about building wealth. The first truth sets the tone: being poor sucks. But they quickly distinguish between being \"broke\" (having no money, which can be temporary) and having a \"poor mindset\" (which keeps people stuck). Even high-income earners can have a poor mindset, they explain, sharing examples of pro athletes and celebrities who earned millions but lost it all. The discussion moves to whether the financial system is \"rigged.\" While acknowledging real systemic challenges, they argue that viewing it as a rigged system leads to powerlessness. Instead, they suggest viewing wealth-building as a game with specific rules to learn and master. Several guests share candid stories about their own financial journeys. Brambila describes living in a van while earning seven figures, challenging assumptions about what wealth looks like. Klontz reveals how he lost money day trading during the tech bubble, using that experience to warn against get-rich-quick schemes. The conversation tackles touchy subjects like distancing yourself from friends with poor money mindsets. Klontz shares how he had to end a friendship with his best man when their different approaches to business created tension. They emphasize this isn't about income levels - it's about mindset and habits. Through personal examples, they explore why people often undervalue their work. Brambila describes initially pricing his online courses too low due to imposter syndrome. They discuss how both employees and entrepreneurs need to understand their true market value. The duo challenges common beliefs about jobs, arguing that \"only liars love their jobs\" since most people would change how they work if they had financial freedom. They use the example of petting puppies - even a dream job becomes less appealing when you lose control over your time. On lottery tickets, they expand beyond just criticizing gambling to examine how get-rich-quick mindsets distract from real wealth-building strategies. Klontz shares research showing 97% of day traders lose money, using this to illustrate why seemingly easy paths to wealth usually fail. Throughout the episode, the guests weave together psychology, practical advice, and frank discussion of uncomfortable truths about money. While some of their statements spark controversy, they back up their positions with research and real-world examples from their own lives and their work with clients.",

    "description": "I’m still here! I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",

The couple’s been together since 2013 and looks forward to celebrating their 10-year anniversary in November. While Brian and Michael have achieved a lot, they feel as though their debt and lack of home ownership is holding them back.
