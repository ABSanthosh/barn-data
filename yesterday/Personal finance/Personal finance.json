    "link": "https://affordanything.com/604-first-friday-how-aprils-tariffs-changed-the-economy/",
    "description": "The biggest trade shake-up in 135 years is happening right now. April brought tariff levels that economists say haven't been seen since the 1890s, creating ripple effects throughout the economy. We're seeing a stark disconnect between official economic data and how people feel about their financial future. While the economy added 177,000 jobs in April — beating forecasts — consumer confidence has plummeted to alarming levels. Almost 70 percent of Americans now expect higher unemployment ahead, despite the strong job numbers. The tariffs have triggered some unexpected behaviors. Companies rushed to import goods before prices increased, which ironically pushed the trade deficit to record levels. Consumers went on buying sprees for cars, computers, and other expensive items, fearing they'd soon cost much more. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have surged to their highest levels in decades. What does this mean for investors? Bond markets reacted dramatically, with Treasury yields posting one of the sharpest spikes on record mid-April before settling back down. The dollar weakened significantly, and economists have raised recession probability to 45 percent — up from 30 percent just last month. Small businesses are feeling the uncertainty too. After initial optimism about potential tax cuts and deregulation, their expectations have soured amid concerns about how tariffs might hurt smaller firms disproportionately. Market volatility has hit retirement savers particularly hard. We take a call from a listener named Johanna who shared that she lost 30 percent of her portfolio due to recent tariff-related swings. She’s wondering whether she’s still \"Coast FIRE\" — even when market shocks alter her retirement math. Join us as we break down April's economic data, explain what's behind the market volatility, and discuss what these historic tariffs might mean for your money in the months ahead.",

Wendy’s pension and social security will cover all her basic expenses during retirement. Does the four percent rule still apply to her discretionary nest egg, or is there another approach?

I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",

A salesman had come knocking on our door. This was strange since the box factory was (and still is) located in a rural area. But somehow this guy had found us and he was there to make his pitch: He was a salesman who trained salesmen. (And, presumably, saleswomen although this wasn't part of the spiel in 1992.) Dad, amused, introduced this fellow to me. \"This is J.D.,\" Dad said. \"He's our salesman. Talk to him.\" So, this guy sat down with me in a back room of the shabby trailer house that served as company HQ. (This was the very trailer house I'd grown up in. And trust me when I say it was a pit, a sty. It was just as bad as you're imagining. Maybe worse.)",
