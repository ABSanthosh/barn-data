I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",

    "description": "The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by half a percentage point. What does this mean for your mortgage, your savings account, and the economy at large? In this First Friday economic episode, we dive deep into the Fed's decision. But that's just the beginning. As the presidential election looms, we'll also unpack the economic proposals from both candidates, examining how their plans for housing, taxes, and more could shape your financial future. We emphasize critical, non-partisan analysis of economic proposals. We want you to understand complex economic issues and their potential impacts, rather than advocating for specific political positions. Here are more specifics about this episode: The Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by half a percentage point – the first rate reduction since the pandemic – is the biggest economic story of the month. We start by exploring the implications of the Federal Reserve’s rate cut, from falling mortgage and auto loan rates to potential increases in home prices and a tightening housing inventory. We also touch on the flip side: declining yields on high-interest savings accounts and CDs. We unpack the reasoning behind the Fed's decision, including shifting concerns from inflation to unemployment. We delve into economic indicators like the \"dot plot\" and \"R-Star,\" explaining their significance in predicting future interest rates and economic trends. Then we discuss the latest jobs report, with 254,000 new jobs added in September, surpassing expectations. We break down the unemployment rate's drop to 4.1 percent. As the conversation shifts to the upcoming election, we take a nonpartisan approach to examining economic proposals from both presidential candidates. The episode focuses on policy rather than politics, encouraging critical thinking about each proposal's potential impacts. One area of bipartisan agreement - a proposal for no tax on tips for service workers - is scrutinized. We explain why economists across the political spectrum view this idea skeptically, highlighting the lack of specificity in defining \"service workers\" and \"tips.\" Housing policy takes center stage, with both candidates proposing regulatory streamlining for home construction and opening federal lands for development. We discuss the limitations of federal intervention in what are often local zoning and regulatory issues. The episode also examines proposals for first-time homebuyer assistance, explaining how subsidizing demand in a supply-constrained market could potentially lead to higher housing prices. Throughout the discussion, we emphasize the importance of evaluating these policies based on their potential economic impacts rather than political affiliations. This episode will help you make more informed decisions about personal finances and policy preferences.",

It's clear to me (and to Kim) that above all else, I need to make 2023 the year of me. 2023 — The Year of Me More than a decade ago, I got into the habit of theming my years and months. It was fun! It was also fruitful. Whenever I decided to devote a span of time to one thing, I had great results, whether it was with fitness or writing or dating. This habit of theming lasted for a couple of years, then fell by the wayside.\u003c/",

A salesman had come knocking on our door. This was strange since the box factory was (and still is) located in a rural area. But somehow this guy had found us and he was there to make his pitch: He was a salesman who trained salesmen. (And, presumably, saleswomen although this wasn't part of the spiel in 1992.) Dad, amused, introduced this fellow to me. \"This is J.D.,\" Dad said. \"He's our salesman. Talk to him.\" So, this guy sat down with me in a back room of the shabby trailer house that served as company HQ. (This was the very trailer house I'd grown up in. And trust me when I say it was a pit, a sty. It was just as bad as you're imagining. Maybe worse.)",
