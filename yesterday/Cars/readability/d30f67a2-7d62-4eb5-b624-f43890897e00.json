  "description": "This 1985 Porsche 911 Carrera cabriolet is a Rest-of-World example that was purchased new in Germany and was imported to the US and federalized in 1985. It remained under original ownership until December 2023, was listed on BaT in May 2024, and was acquired by the selling dealer later that year. DP Motorsports bodywork and interior components were reportedly fitted before importation, and the car is finished in black over black leather. It is powered by a 3.2-liter flat-six paired with a 915 five-speed manual transaxle, and equipment includes a Fabspeed Motorsport cat-bypass pipe and Maxflo muffler, 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels, heated power-adjustable front sport seats, air conditioning, power windows, and a Porsche Classic Communications Management (PCCM) stereo. Work in 2024 included servicing the engine, overhauling the climate control system, rebuilding the shifter, and replacing the seat switches. This Carrera cabriolet is offered by the selling dealer with an owner's manual, a tool kit, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title.",

It remained under original ownership until December 2023, was listed on BaT in May 2024, and was acquired by the selling dealer later that year. DP Motorsports bodywork and interior components were reportedly fitted before importation, and the car is finished in black over black leather. It is powered by a 3.2-liter flat-six paired with a 915 five-speed manual transaxle, and equipment includes a Fabspeed Motorsport cat-bypass pipe and Maxflo muffler, 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels, heated power-adjustable front sport seats, air conditioning, power windows, and a Porsche Classic Communications Management (PCCM) stereo. Work in 2024 included servicing the engine, overhauling the climate control system, rebuilding the shifter, and replacing the seat switches. This Carrera cabriolet is offered by the selling dealer with an owner’s manual, a tool kit, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title. The car is finished in black (A1) and reportedly received its DP Motorsport front and rear spoilers along with flared fenders shortly after initial delivery. Exterior details include a front-mount oil cooler, fog lights, headlight washers, amber side markers, heated power-adjustable side mirrors, a black soft top, and Euro-market bumpers. Cracks on the front lip spoiler are noted on a September 2024 invoice and are visible in the gallery below along with chips on the leading edges of the rear fenders. Fuchs 16″ alloy wheels with black-finished centers and anodized lips were mounted with Continental ExtremeContact Sport 02 tires in 2024. Work in December 2023 included repacking the front wheel bearings, flushing the brake fluid, and replacing the front and rear brake rotors, pads, and sensors. The heated power-adjustable front sport seats and folding individual rear seats are upholstered in black leather. The DP center console was trimmed to match and houses cassette-tape storage. Additional appointments include air conditioning, power windows, and a Porsche Classic Communication Management stereo. Work in 2024 included adjusting the clutch cable and replacing the shifter ball socket, shift rod coupling, shifter bushings, air conditioning evaporator core, blower motor, and seat adjustment switches. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a central VDO tachometer with a 6,300-rpm redline as well as a replacement DP-branded 200-mph speedometer, a quartz clock, and gauges for oil level, oil pressure, oil temperature, and fuel level. Additional gauges for voltage and outdoor temperature are housed in the center console. The six-digit odometer shows 28k miles. The speedometer was repaired in 2021 with a replacement gear set, and total mileage is unknown. The 3.2-liter M930/21 flat-six was factory rated at 231 horsepower and 209 lb-ft of torque and features a Fabspeed Motorsport Euro-style cat-bypass pipe and Maxflo exhaust system. Work in 2024 included changing the oil and replacing the air conditioning compressor, receiver/drier, and spritzer nozzles as well as the idle speed valve, battery, air filter, fuel filter, accessory drive belts, spark plugs, and valve cover gaskets. The catalytic converter has been removed. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Type 915 five-speed manual transaxle. The gearbox fluid was changed in December 2023, and the right axle seal was replaced in December 2024. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage and lists history in Ohio and Florida from the initial entry in September 2008. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
