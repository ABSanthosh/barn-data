  "description": "Ever since it came out back in 2011, the erstwhile Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX has been one of the most well-rounded sport touring packages. Fast forward to 2025, and while this breed is sadly all but extinct, Kawasaki has determinedly stuck to its guns and brought out the new Ninja 1100SX. Kawasaki Ninja 1100SX changes for 2025 Most of the changes have happened under the largely familiar skin Kawasaki has chosen to focus only on updating the internals, and the main change comes in the form of this new 1,099cc four-cylinder motor, which was birthed by stroking out the erstwhile 1,043cc powerplant by an additional 3mm. However, since this engine complies with Euro 5+ norms, peak output figures are slightly different. Save for the new paint and graphics, the Ninja 1100SX is visually identical to the older 1000. With 136 ponies on tap, the 1100 is down 6hp compared to the 1000, although with 113Nm of torque available, it does have 2Nm more. And since this is a sensible sport tourer and not a headbanging supersport, Kawasaki has wisely given this mill taller 5th and 6th gear ratios. However, to ensure acceleration is not humdrum, the final drive gearing is slightly shorter, courtesy of the one-tooth-larger rear sprocket.  The TFT display is crisp and the UI is uncomplicated. Other changes include an improved, butter-smooth bidirectional quickshifter (which works literally from just above idle!), a 10mm-larger rear disc brake (which should come in handy because this bike will likely be ridden with luggage and/or a pillion), and a USB-C charger near the left-hand switch cube.  Charging port's housing could have been executed in a neater, sleeker manner. Kawasaki Ninja 1100SX performance, ride comfort It is both supremely comfortable and blazingly fast As evident from these pictures, the Ninja 1100SX is visually identical to the 1000, save for the stealthy black paint job and green graphics. This is the only colour you can buy it in, as the green paint is currently exclusive to the higher SE variant, which is not sold here. Generously padded seats keep you cosseted. All of the above-mentioned changes aren’t very drastic, and the impact they’ve had on the riding experience isn’t landmark either. But who’s complaining about that? The Ninja 1000SX was a smooth, comfortable, and polished sport tourer to begin with, and this 1100 carries forward all its strong points (save for one, which we’ll address later). It can be both blazingly quick and amazingly mellow when needed. Over the 750-odd kilometres I clocked on the Ninja, never once did I miss the six ponies it has relinquished to Euro5+ (unlike those pesky spec-sheet warriors). There’s no other way to say this – 136hp is a LOT of power. And since the midrange has been bolstered, in the 3,000-7,000rpm zone, you could argue that this is a more effortlessly quick bike than before. On that topic, you’d better have your wits about you before whacking the throttle open because the Ninja will catapult you toward the horizon with surprisingly calm yet undeniable ferocity. All the while, the motor was belting out a smooth inline-four scream, but what I enjoyed more was the intake howl every time I twisted the accelerator. Kawasaki Ninja 1100SX handling Given the right inputs, this 238kg bike can handle very well And even in the city, the Ninja 1100 is perfectly composed, and you can just as easily commute as you can travel from Mumbai to Manali on it. The only trouble within city limits is that the mirrors stick out a little too much, and even for 5’11 me, reaching them in my natural riding position isn’t possible. The 135mm of ground clearance available is on the lower side, but you can make do if you exercise a little caution. Wide-set mirrors demand caution when filtering. But can this Ninja slice through a corner properly? 238kg is a lot, let’s make no bones about it, but once you adapt your riding style to the Ninja’s heft, you’ll be able to go just as fast as your friend who’s on the ZX-10R (on the road, at least) without any of the agony of having to sit like a gargoyle. So, is this the perfect road-going superbike for India? In a word, yes. It’s tantalisingly fast, fabulously comfortable, and superbly capable. Kawasaki Ninja 1100SX price and verdict Its an accomplished machine but its no longer the VFM big-bike it once was The only caveat is that, at Rs 13.49 lakh, the big Ninja is no longer the VFM big-bike proposition it once was. Not long ago, the BS4 ZX6R and the 1000SX were priced almost on par. Today, the price difference between the BS6 ZX6R and the 1100SX is nearly Rs 2 lakh! Generously padded seats keep you cosseted. The fact remains that this is still a wonderfully sweet and capable machine (and the only one of its kind in this class), so if your pocket permits, I’d recommend you make a trip to your nearest Kawasaki showroom. I know I would if I could. Also See: Kawasaki Ninja 1100SX video review",
