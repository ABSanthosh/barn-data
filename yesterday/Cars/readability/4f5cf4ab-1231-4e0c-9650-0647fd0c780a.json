  "description": "Prices for KTM’s dirt bikes start from Rs 4.75 lakh for the 50 SX and go up to Rs 12.96 for the 350 EXC-F. With the launch of these enduro and Motocross bikes, KTM intends to build the requisite racing ecosystem in India with a new motorsport training facility in Bangalore along with a new racing program development. Engine sizes range from 50cc-450cc Includes Enduro, Motocross and Kids bikes KTM dirt bike range details Three of the six new KTM dirt bikes launched in India are aimed at very young riders. These are the KTM 50 SX, KTM 65 SX and KTM 85 SX. All three of these use two-stroke engines, with the 50cc displacing 5.4hp in a bike that weighs just 41kg. Meanwhile, the KTM 85 SX produces 16hp and has a kerb weight of 81kg. The above bikes are targeted at children getting into the world of off-road riding, but KTM also has options available for adults looking at powerful, full-sized motocross bikes. The first of these is the KTM 250 SX-F which gets a powerful 249.9cc four stroke motor that produces 46.8hp at 13,900rpm and 26.5Nm at 9,500rpm. The 250 SX-F weighs in at 104kg.

Despite the huge jump in performance over the 250 SX-F, the 450SX-F weighs just 3kgs more at 107kg. Finally there’s also an Enduro bike in the form of the KTM 350 EXC-F Six Days. This is essentially a dirt bike with basic lighting in the form of a head and tail lamp. This bike runs a 349.7cc four-stroke engine that produces 45hp at 9500rpm. The bike weighs 107kg dry and as with the other dirt bikes mentioned here, it has a tall seat height - 963mm in this case. All prices mentioned above are ex-showroom, India.
