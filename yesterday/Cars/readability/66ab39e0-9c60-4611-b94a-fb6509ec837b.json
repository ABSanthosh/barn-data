  "text": "To close out 2024, we’ve asked our three busiest Speedhunters of the year to highlight their three favorite stories from the past 12 months – from feature cars to events and everything in between. Today, Toby Thyer is sharing his highlights from Japan. TT: 2024 has been a great year for Speedhunting, packed with unforgettable cars and moments, making it tough to pick just three to highlight. From Datsun mini trucks to a wide-body E24, a GT-R-bodied kei car, and the wild, animalistic energy of Retro Havoc, it’s been a whirlwind. Porsches, WRC legends, and the Mid Night crew at the Option Street Night also stand out. But as far as incredible memories go, meeting the minds behind Tommykaira would be right up there. Spending time with Kikuo Kaira and Yoshikazu Tomita – chatting and photographing them – was both a pleasure and a privilege. These two friends couldn’t be more different, yet fate brought them together to create one of Japan’s most iconic performance motoring brands. Check out the feature here: Meeting The Great Minds Behind Tommykaira Regardless of where you stand, police cars are undeniably cool. But a Porsche 912 police car from the late ’60s? Now, that’s something I never expected to find in Japan. This one is the last of its kind still on the road, having lived a hard-working life. A high-speed chase arrest earned it an early retirement, but it narrowly escaped the scrap yard. In my book, this is probably the coolest Mizwa Porsche in existence. Check out the feature here: Patrolling Japan’s Expressways In A Porsche 912 Police Car My third pick was recently shot in Tokyo’s Electric Town, Akihabara. This rare FD3S RX-7 Type RZ, wearing an even rarer 97GT body kit by RE Amemiya from the 1997 Tokyo Auto Salon – the only one still known to exist – is a work of art. With its pure ’90s curves, it feels like something straight out of H.R. Giger’s Alien. Seeing it lit up by Akihabara’s neon lights was as close to time travel as I’ll ever get. It’s inspiring to see young enthusiasts like Ryota-san keeping these cars alive and proudly representing Japanese tuner culture.
