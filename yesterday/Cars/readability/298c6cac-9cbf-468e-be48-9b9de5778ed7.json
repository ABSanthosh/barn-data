  "text": "What’s the longest a dealership has had your car in the shop? July 7, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier Modern vehicles are incredibly complex and fixing them takes time. This issue has been compounded by a recent shortage of technicians. It’s no secret that cars are becoming increasingly high-tech and difficult to repair. On top of that, there has been a shortage of automotive technicians, although that situation is reportedly improving. Given these developments, it shouldn’t be surprising that getting your car fixed can be a multi-day ordeal. However, this can vary significantly depending on the problem and the solution. More: Your Car Repair Could Take A Lot Longer Because Auto Shops Are Struggling To Find Mechanics That brings us to our question of the day, how long is too long for a dealership to fix your car? This is a timely question as my Jeep Cherokee has been sitting at a dealership for nearly four weeks. Even worse, they haven’t been able to identify the problem, just replicate the issue. Needless to say, my patience was wearing thin around the three week mark and now it’s pretty much expired. This is a far cry from what I was expecting when I originally scheduled an appointment in early June. In most cases, you drop your car off and it may take the dealership a day or two to get around to working on it, if they’re busy. After that point, you’d expect them to address the issue relatively quickly. While this can take some time, especially if they’re waiting on parts, it shouldn’t turn into a multi-week saga. Unfortunately, that’s the boat I find myself in and the process has taken so long that my warranty has now expired. I’m not sure how this is going to pan out, but my third Jeep could very well be my last. With all that being said, how long should it take for a dealership to fix your vehicle? Also, what’s the longest a dealership has had your car in the shop? Feel free to let us know in the comments below.",
