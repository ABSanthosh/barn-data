This Town Car is now offered by the selling dealer at no reserve with an owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Virginia title. The car is finished in Performance White Clearcoat with a white vinyl landau roof, and exterior equipment includes a keyless entry pad, dual exhaust outlets, heated power-folding side mirrors, a power antenna, and bright window surrounds and trim. The car has 15″ geometric-spoke aluminum wheels, and it was factory equipped with stabilizer bars, an independent front suspension, and speed-sensitive variable-assist power steering. Braking is provided by power-assisted four-wheel discs. The seats are trimmed in Saddle leather, while woodgrain trim accents the color-coordinated dashboard and door panels. Amenities include a power-adjustable driver’s seat, an aftermarket stereo, a JBL audio system, cruise control, and automatic climate control. The leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a speedometer and displays for instant fuel economy, fuel level, and coolant temperature. The digital odometer indicates 77k miles. The 4.6-liter V8 was factory rated at 210 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. The selling dealer states that the serpentine belt, spark plugs, and spark plug wires were replaced and the oil was changed in preparation for the sale. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage. You are not connected to real-time updates.
