  "description": "The last time we compared these big luxury electric SUVs, exactly 12 months ago, the BMW iX, in its xDrive40 guise, was the most affordable in its class and right near the top in aspects such as comfort and driving pleasure. However, it simply couldn’t match the Mercedes EQE’s performance and range. Soon after, though, BMW replaced it with the xDrive50, which had a larger battery, more powerful motors and a healthier claimed range, thus completing the package. But the upgrade made it Rs 18 lakh heavier on the pocket, taking its ex-showroom price to Rs 1.39 crore, exactly the same as the Mercedes-Benz EQE SUV, which was the priciest in its class. Range and performance aside, the EQE SUV had its share of flaws. The good news is that the fully imported EQE SUV now comes with substantial discounts (to the tune of Rs 25 lakh at the dealer level), following the launch of the more luxurious, locally assembled EQS SUV that’s priced just Rs 2 lakh higher than the EQE. So, can the EQE’s discounts give it an edge, or does the improved iX sway the game in its favour? We find out. Mercedes EQE SUV vs BMW iX50 design Sure, these cars belong to the same segment and are priced similarly, but their personalities are poles apart. The BMW’s unapologetically in-your-face styling commands attention, and even though it might be too radical for some, those who wish to stand out in a crowd are likely to gravitate towards the iX. The EQE appears dwarfed by the iX because of its smaller dimensions and sleeker design language with soft, flowing lines. Out of the two, it has the more understated appearance. While the iX looks more butch and SUV-like, the EQE has a crossover-esque appeal. Mercedes EQE SUV vs BMW iX50 interior (Clockwise) BMW interface cluttered with too many apps; Dummy switches have no place in this car; Crystal-effect buttons look and feel premium;  Unlike its polarising exterior, the BMW’s minimalist interior has a more universal appeal. The soft-closing doors and frameless windows add to the sense of occasion. The curved screens, an unconventionally shaped steering wheel, champagne-coloured and crystalline-effect trims and even the black-brown colour scheme are all brilliantly executed. The rotary drive selector feels great to use, but the shortcut keys around it don’t. While they make access to the infotainment menus easy, what isn’t nice is that the entire panel moves even if you depress just one key, and that doesn’t feel premium at all. Moreover, the touchscreen’s interface is cluttered with multiple menus and sub-menus, and some important functions are buried deep within; it’s confusing and could overwhelm some users. The softer cushioning in iX feels comfier, but the low-set seat and upright backrest aren’t ideal. The iX feels more ‘SUV’ from the driver’s seat, thanks to an unusually low-set dash, a flat bonnet that’s completely in your line of sight and a raised seat. While the front seats have multiple adjustments and options to get comfortable, the rear seat also has a clear advantage in terms of comfort. The completely flat floor and sheer cabin volume enhance the sense of space, and it is wide enough for three adults. The cushioning and support are good, but the rear bench is low-set, the fixed backrest is quite upright, and it also misses window blinds (motorised or otherwise). So, it falls short of the full chauffeur-driven luxury experience. (Clockwise) Slick, intuitive touchscreen feels great to use; Sound quality and clarity are just outstanding; Passenger screen is likely to have limited use;  That said, with its angled seat base, short squab, upright backrest and hard cushioning, the EQE’s back seat is a few notches lower in terms of comfort. But where this cabin redeems itself is with the ‘wow’ factor. The pièce de résistance is its uber-premium Hyperscreen dashboard, which comprises three screens embedded in a single pane, giving the effect of one gigantic unit. The central touchscreen is far simpler to use than the BMW’s, with a more sorted interface. There’s a third passenger screen, but it feels like an overkill, with little real-world use. While the white interior truly lifts the cabin’s luxury quotient, cleaning it will warrant special effort; you can have it in black, too. The steering-mounted controls are fiddly to use. Some of these are touch-sensitive, and others are buttons, which, like in the BMW, make the entire panel move. It lacks a satisfying tactile feel. EQE’s rear seat isn’t as comfy due to the angled seat base, upright backrest and hard cushioning. An interesting point to note is that despite being built on dedicated EV platforms, neither car gets a frontal luggage area, as seen in most born EVs out there. In fact, you can’t open their bonnets at all. As a result, you have to rely on their conventional boots, and sadly, both have their spare tyres placed on the boot floor, which severely hampers the usable luggage space.  Mercedes EQE SUV vs BMW iX50 battery, range With its new motors making 523hp and 765Nm, the BMW is abundantly powerful. For a luxury EV, the responses feel a touch too sensitive. With aggressive inputs, it leaps forward like a scalded cat, its four wheels struggling for grip. Outright acceleration times are certainly quicker; 0-100kph comes up in just 4.46 seconds. However, the EQE isn’t too far behind, with a time of 4.8 seconds, and in the real world, it feels nearly as quick as the iX. The ride comfort and dynamics are typical BMW – superb. That’s because even though the EQE’s motors make only 408hp, they make a whopping 858Nm of torque, which lends this Mercedes EV plenty of poke. That said, its responses to pedal inputs are more measured, and the power delivery feels more linear, making acceleration comfier for the driver and passengers alike.  Like all of Merc’s bigger EQ EVs, there’s a great focus on aerodynamics, and the EQE’s slippery shape helped it achieve an overall efficiency of 5.3km/kWh, whereas the boxy iX managed 4.8km/kWh in our real-world range test. However, as the iX gets a larger 105.2kWh battery, its combined range extrapolates to 504km. The EQE, with its 90.56kWh battery, can be driven up to 480km on a full charge. Aerodynamically efficient design aids real-world efficiency. While the iX is marginally quicker and has a slightly healthier range, where it truly holds an advantage over the Mercedes is in the way it drives. Despite its size and bulk, it drives like a typical BMW, exuding the right amount of driver confidence and feeling sharp and willing to change directions. Equally impressive are its ride quality and bump-absorption capability. The iX rounds off rough patches, sharp bumps and road shocks exceptionally well. Unlike the Mercedes, which thuds over bad sections of the road, the iX’s ride feels plush and truly luxurious. What’s more, the EQE SUV’s suspension setup is overly soft in any of its driving modes, leading to excessive pitch, roll and movement, especially at low speeds, which doesn’t do it any favours. Mercedes EQE SUV vs BMW iX50 verdict The Mercedes-Benz EQE’s richly appointed interior, the lure of the three-pointed star and the substantial discounts on offer make it worthy of consideration. But with the iX xDrive50, BMW has taken the luxury game a notch further. Performance and range are better, the ride is comfier, and if, like many buyers in this segment, you love getting behind the wheel, the iX feels great to drive, too. All things considered, you will have to pay more for the iX (taking the EQE’s discount into consideration), but the advantages it holds over the Merc make it feel worth the stretch, and that’s why it wins this comparison test.

What’s more, the EQE SUV’s suspension setup is overly soft in any of its driving modes, leading to excessive pitch, roll and movement, especially at low speeds, which doesn’t do it any favours.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMercedes EQE SUV vs BMW iX50 verdict\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/www.autocarindia.com (69).jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Mercedes-Benz EQE’s richly appointed interior, the lure of the three-pointed star and the substantial discounts on offer make it worthy of consideration. But with the iX xDrive50, BMW has taken the luxury game a notch further. Performance and range are better, the ride is comfier, and if, like many buyers in this segment, you love getting behind the wheel, the iX feels great to drive, too. All things considered, you will have to pay more for the iX (taking the EQE’s discount into consideration), but the advantages it holds over the Merc make it feel worth the stretch, and that’s why it wins this comparison test.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Comparison EQE vs iX50 Web.png\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso, see:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-comparison-reviews/mercedes-e-class-vs-bmw-5-series-comparison-433838\"\u003eMercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series comparison\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-comparison-reviews/mercedes-e-class-vs-bmw-5-series-comparison-433838\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTata Curvv vs Citroen Basalt comparison\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-comparison-reviews/land-rover-defender-vs-mercedes-g-class-vs-jeep-wranger-comparison-433723\"\u003eLand Rover Defender vs Mercedes G Class vs Jeep Wranger comparison\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"tagged-articles-container-434391\"\u003e\u003cul id=\"tab-id-434391\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-imghref-id-434391\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-images-container-434391\"\u003eImages\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-vidhref-id-434391\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-videos-container-434391\"\u003eVideos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
