  "description": "Mercedes has launched the Maybach SL 680 Monogram Series in India at an ex-showroom price of Rs 4.2 crore. First revealed in 2024, the luxury roadster is touted as the sportiest Maybach ever made. Bookings have started and only three cars are allocated for this year. SL 680's bonnet, finished in Obsidian Black, has Maybach logos The two-seater gets white Nappa leather upholstery It is based on the AMG SL 63 and can go from 0-100kph in 4.1s Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 exterior Front grille gets illuminated vertical slats A chrome radiator grille with illuminated vertical slats and MAYBACH lettering makes the SL 680 stand out from the AMG SL 63, on which the former is based. The bumper and the long bonnet (which is finished in Obsidian Black) have an abundance of Maybach logos to differentiate the car further. Buyers can also have these logos embossed into the soft-top fabric roof as part of the customisation programme.  Maybach 5-hole forged wheels (optional). As for the profile, bespoke 21-inch forged wheels feature 36 spokes connected to the three-pointed star emblem in the centre. A sleek chrome strip runs across the length between the wheels; door handles and front fenders also have chrome elements. Like the front, a smoother and chrome-decorated rear bumper looks toned down compared to the SL roadster. Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 interior Maybach patterns on seats Unlike its four-seat AMG sibling, the SL 680 has space for only two occupants. The cabin’s white Nappa leather upholstery comes courtesy of Manufaktur, Mercedes’ personalisation range. Its new three-spoke steering wheel has ‘MAYBACH’ lettering, while the roll hoops behind seat headrests get Maybach signets. The portrait-styled touchscreen can be adjusted for the best viewing angle. The 12.3-inch driver’s display and adjustable 11.9-inch central touchscreen are similar to the SL 63. Mercedes has equipped the central touchscreen with its AI-based MBUX multimedia system. It has tweaked the car’s exhaust system to keep the cabin noise low and tuned the suspension for comfort.  Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 powertrain 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol Twin-scroll turbos are placed between the cylinder heads for quick response. Under the hood is the familiar 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 engine that makes 585hp and 800Nm. A 9-speed automatic transmission sends power to all four wheels, and from a standstill, the SL 680 can hit the 100kph mark in 4.1 seconds (0.5 seconds slower than the AMG SL 63). The top speed is 260kph. Also, see: Mercedes Maybach SL 680 India debut on March 17 Mercedes Maybach GLS to get second facelift 2025 Mercedes CLA debuts with both electric and hybrid powertrains",
