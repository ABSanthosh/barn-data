  "text": "The range-extended C10 will debut next month and offer more than 590 miles of combined range 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Leapmotor will use the Brussels Motor Show to introduce the new C10 REEV. The model features a range-extended powertrain with a 1.5-liter engine and a 28.4 kWh battery pack. Customers can expect 212 hp and a combined range in excess of 590 miles. The Leapmotor C10 lineup is expanding as the company has announced a new range-extended variant, ahead of its debut at the Brussels Motor Show. It promises to combine the “benefits of electric vehicles and traditional gasoline cars, offering extended range and superior fuel efficiency.” Starting under the hood, there’s a 1.5-liter engine, a 28.4 kWh battery pack, and a 212 hp (158 kW /215 PS) electric motor. The battery provides an electric-only WLTP range of 90 miles (145 km), while the engine increases that distance to over 590 miles (950 km) combined. More: New Leapmotor B10 Goes After Europe’s EV Market With Stellantis In Its Corner Leapmotor didn’t go into many specifics, but said the crossover primarily operates as an electric vehicle. When the battery becomes low, the internal combustion engine activates to generate electricity and recharge the battery. The company added that in combined mode, the model has a fuel consumption rating of 0.4 L/100 km and CO2 emissions of 10 g/km. If you’d prefer not to use gas, a DC fast charger can deliver approximately 45 miles of range (72.5 km) in 18 minutes. We can expect to learn more next month, but the C10 REEV presumably echoes the fully electric variant. This means we can expect LED headlights, a panoramic glass roof, and 18-inch wheels. They’re joined by privacy glass and flush-mounted door handles. The interior is a tad plain, but C10 buyers will find power front seats, a wireless smartphone charger, a 12-speaker audio system, and a 14.6-inch infotainment system. German customers can also get a higher-end variant that has heated and ventilated front seats, an ambient lighting system, a power liftgate, and larger 20-inch wheels.",
