  "text": "Unlike many aftermarket solutions, GM Defense has built armoring into the original design and manufacturing of the Suburban Shield November 1, 2024 at 20:28 by Brad Anderson The Chevy Suburban Shield is GM Defense’s latest armored SUV built for U.S. diplomats’ safety. Designed from scratch, the SUV offers integrated armor and upgraded suspension for durability. All examples come equipped with a thumping 6.2-liter V8 as standard or an optional 3.0L diesel. The Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) will soon be riding around in specially-equipped Chevrolet Suburbans, thanks to GM Defense. These beefed up full-size SUVs have been built for the DSS’s Heavy-Duty armored Sport Utility Vehicle program and will be used by the law enforcement and security arm of the US Department of State. In other words, these aren’t your typical Suburbans prowling the mall parking lots—these are purpose-built for the world’s most volatile hotspots. This special Chevy is known as the Suburban Shield and, from the outside, looks like any regular Suburban. However, it has been extensively modified and is based on a unique body-on-frame chassis with upgraded suspension to support the increased weight. In addition, and unlike many aftermarket armoring solutions, GM Defense integrates the armor directly into the vehicle’s design and manufacturing process, making it a far more cohesive and resilient package than what the bolt-on competition offers. Read: GM Defense Gets Contract To Build HD SUVs For U.S. Government Complementing the revised front and rear suspension and new power steering system of the Suburban Shield is the flagship 6.2-liter V8 from the regular Suburban, although the 3.0-liter Duramax turbodiesel is also an option. The DSS doesn’t need the creature comforts of a consumer-grade Suburban, so GM Defense has stripped away features like automatic emergency braking, front pedestrian braking, HD Surround Vision, and Lane Keep Assist. After all, when you’re dodging diplomatic threats, you don’t need a nannying computer braking for pigeons in crosswalks. Both 1LT and 2LT configurations are offered for the SUV. The entry-level 1LT places passengers on bench seats in both the second and third rows, while the more premium 2LT offers captain’s chairs in the second row and jump seats in the third. Each configuration is designed to meet the specific demands of diplomatic security missions, balancing practicality with a tactical edge. “I had the opportunity to try out the prototype,” Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security, Gentry Smith, said at the delivery event in North Carolina. “It had good acceleration, handled better in the turns and the heavy-duty anti-lock braking system was far superior to our aftermarket vehicles. You could really feel the stability and performance in the redesigned chassis. The new HD SUV represents a new cost-effective era in the design and building of these badly needed vehicles to help us carry out our mission to ensure the safe and secure conduct of foreign policy in some of our most challenging and dangerous posts,” he added.",
