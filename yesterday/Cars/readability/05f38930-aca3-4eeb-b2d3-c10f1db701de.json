  "text": "The automaker says it's trying to minimize the impact of US import tariffs on its buyers 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson Nissan will keep vehicle prices stable for imported models until at least June 2. Tariffs will begin impacting vehicle prices once the current inventory runs out. The company’s two American plants operated at only 50% capacity last year. While many anticipated an immediate price surge for cars in the U.S. following President Trump’s sweeping 25% auto tariffs, that hasn’t exactly been the case. In fact, several manufacturers have chosen to keep prices stable for a few months, and Nissan has now joined the ranks of those resisting the urge to raise prices right away. However, don’t get too comfortable, as shoppers should prepare for price increases in the second half of the year. Read: Nissan Slashes US-Bound Rogue Production In Japan As Tariffs Bite In a memo sent to dealers and seen by Autonews, Nissan’s U.S. sales head, Vinay Shahani, confirmed that prices on imported vehicles will remain unchanged through at least June 2. He also noted that the company has enough tariff-free vehicles in stock to last for nearly three months. However, once that supply runs out, the automaker will need to decide on its next move. A Temporary Hold, But Changes Are Coming “While we know these new vehicle tariffs will have an impact on affordability for car buyers over a long period of time, we will try to minimize that impact on Nissan buyers,” Shahani added. Nissan is eager to shift more production of its popular models to factories in the United States, helping to protect customers from the full impacts of the tariffs. According to Shahani, the automaker wants to leverage more of its current US capacity over the coming year, and plans to increase local production of the Rogue, Pathfinder, Murano, and Frontier. According to Auto News, Nissan’s factories in Tennessee and Mississippi were only operating at roughly half of their combined capacity in 2024. A key change being made is the addition of a second shift to the Rogue’s assembly line. This will allow Nissan to increase production of the Rogue by 54 percent, or the equivalent of roughly 60,000 vehicles. On top of ramping up production, Nissan is incentivizing dealers with a bonus program for April and May, rewarding stores that hit specific sales targets with extra pay. Earlier this month, the automaker also cut the average prices of the 2025 Pathfinder and Rogue by $1,000, giving US customers a temporary window of relief.",
