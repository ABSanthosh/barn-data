This Ford GT was purchased new through Sarasota Ford and is now offered by the estate of the original owner with a window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, build documents, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title in the name of the late owner’s surviving spouse. First unveiled at the 2015 North American International Auto Show, the second-generation GT was built by Multimatic of Markham, Ontario, with production beginning in December 2016. This example is finished Heritage Blue with Competition Orange stripes and Heritage Roundel Graphics. Additional features include LED headlights, a lightweight Gorilla Glass windshield, butterfly doors, a retractable active rear wing, LED taillights, a rear diffuser, and carbon-fiber exterior trim. The GT features a carbon-fiber monocoque structure bolted to front and rear aluminum subframes that serve as stressed members for the hydraulically adjustable pushrod suspension system. Variable ride height, front-axle lift system, selectable driving modes, and launch control are standard features. Staggered-width 20″ forged aluminum wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires measuring 245/35 up front and 325/30 at the rear. Braking is handled by orange-painted Brembo six-piston monoblock calipers over 15.5” carbon-ceramic discs up front, while four-piston calipers are mounted over 14.1” units out back. The interior is optioned with the ’68 Heritage package, and the Sparco seats are trimmed in black leather and Alcantara upholstery with patterned seat inserts and Gulf-inspired blue and orange stitching. Exposed carbon fiber is visible on the door sills, dashboard, and center console, and the fixed-position driver’s seat is equipped with an adjustable pedal box and steering column. Additional appointments include climate control, an infotainment system with a touchscreen, and six-point harness anchors. The Alcantara-wrapped ’68 Heritage multi-function steering wheel fronts paddle shifters and a configurable digital instrument panel. The digital odometer indicates 3,127 miles. The mid-mounted twin-turbocharged 3.5L EcoBoost V6 features a carbon-fiber engine cover and was factory rated at 647 horsepower and 550 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Getrag seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. The car is equipped with a titanium exhaust system, and carbon-fiber aero panels are fitted on the underside. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Sarasota Ford, and lists factory options, equipment, and a total price of $631,495. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage.
