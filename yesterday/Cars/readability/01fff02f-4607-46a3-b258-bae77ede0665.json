  "text": "The crossover coupe starts under €36,000 and is now available to order 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Lynk \u0026 Co has introduced their first European EV, which is known as the 02. The rear-wheel drive crossover coupe has 268 hp and up to 277 miles of range. Pricing varies by country, but the model starts at €35,995 in key markets. The Chinese invasion of Europe continues as Lynk \u0026 Co has unveiled the new 02. It’s the company’s first electric vehicle for the old continent, although it will also be offered in China as the Z20. Billed as a striking five-door crossover coupe, the 02 has an aerodynamically optimized front end with split lighting units and an active shutter intake. Designers also gave the model a panoramic glass roof, a two-tone paint job, and 19- or 20-inch wheels. Other notable highlights include flush-mounted door handles and a prominent rear spoiler with integrated taillights. More: Lynk \u0026 Co 01 SUV Gains More Powerful PHEV And Improved Infotainment In Europe In a curious twist, the model has a “Hey Honk” feature, which is a customizable sound that allows for “friendly” interactions with pedestrians and other road users. Lynk \u0026 Co said testing has shown “pedestrians found the system to be a preferable alternative to the typical startling horn sound.” In terms of size, the crossover measures 175.6 inches (4460 mm) long, 72.6 inches (1845 mm) wide, and 61.9 inches (1573 mm) tall with a wheelbase that spans 108.5 inches (2755 mm). This means the model is the same length as the Toyota Corolla Cross, but has an extra 4.6 inches (117 mm) between the wheels. A Stylish And High-Tech Interior The minimalist cabin sports a two-tier dashboard and an “aircraft-inspired” oval steering wheel. Drivers sit behind a 10.2-inch digital instrument cluster and most controls are operated via a 15.4-inch infotainment system. The interior features an interesting mix of recycled and translucent materials as well as speckled accents. Buyers will also find dual wireless chargers, a heated steering wheel, and heated power front seats. There’s even a Journey Camera, which allows users to “take selfies or group photos directly from the rearview mirror to capture memories during trips.” Another oddball feature is the so-called “sharing strap.” It’s located next to the steering wheel and the company said a “gentle pull takes users straight to the sharing app … so they can start sharing their car in just a few steps.” Those not in the mood to share will find a frunk that can hold 0.6 cubic feet (15 liters) of gear. It’s joined by a 14.5 cubic foot (410 liters) boot. Rear-Wheel Drive And Up To 277 Miles Of Range The Lynk \u0026 Co 02 rides on Geely’s Sustainable Experience Architecture and has a 66 kWh NMC lithium-ion battery. It feeds a rear-mounted motor producing 268 hp (200 kW / 272 PS) and 253 lb-ft (343 Nm) of torque. This enables the model to accelerate from 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) in 5.5 seconds, before hitting a top speed of 112 mph (180 km/h). Speaking of quick, a 150 kW DC fast charger can take the battery from 10% to 80% in just 30 minutes. When it’s full, drivers can expect to travel up to 277 miles (445 km) on a single charge. Safety is front and center thanks to 21 features including automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, and front/rear cross traffic alert. They’re joined by intelligent cruise control, auto lane change assist, blind spot detection, and traffic sign recognition. The model is currently available to order and pricing starts at €35,495 in Italy. However, in most other countries – including Germany, France, and the Netherlands – it begins at €35,995.",
