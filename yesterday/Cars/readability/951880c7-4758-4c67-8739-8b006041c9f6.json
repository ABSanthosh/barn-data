  "text": "The facelifted Mercedes-AMG C63 is set to gain a new powertrain, replacing the current four-cylinder hybrid April 7, 2025 at 20:23 by Michael Gauthier AMG C63 facelift will reportedly feature a new plug-in hybrid powertrain with a six-cylinder engine. It would replace the current turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that produces a combined 671 hp. Insiders said a return to V8 power wasn’t feasible as the change would require significant revisions. The days of a V8-powered Mercedes C-Class are firmly in the rearview mirror as the current C63 S E Performance is an eco-friendly plug-in hybrid. This means it comes with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, a rear-mounted electric motor, a 6.1 kWh battery pack, and a 4MATIC+ all-wheel drive system. While this gives the car an impressive combined output of 671 hp (500 kW / 680 PS) and 752 lb-ft (1,018 Nm) of torque, it’s hard to get excited about a four-cylinder AMG car that starts at $86,050. This has been reflected in sales, which are reportedly lagging “well behind expectations.” More: Mercedes-AMG C63 S Returns As A 671-HP Plug-In Hybrid That Says 4 Cylinders Is Enough To address the issue, Mercedes is reportedly dropping the 2.0-liter engine and replacing it with a new twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. This echoes the setup used by an assortment of other models including the E53, but it would reportedly be far more powerful in this application. Interestingly, that might not be the only change as Autocar is reporting the facelifted C63 will trade its rear-mounted motor for one that is sandwiched between the engine and transmission. This could potentially lower the combined output, but the numbers are hazy at this point as the publication suggested the new system should develop more than 650 hp (485 kW / 659 PS) and 650 lb-ft (881 Nm) of torque. The engine swap will reportedly occur as part of next year’s facelift and the new powertrain is also slated to be found in the 2027 GLC 63. While six sounds more impressive than four, fans were likely hoping for the return of a V8. Unfortunately for them, packaging constraints reportedly made the twin-turbo 4.0-liter engine “unfeasible” for use in the C-Class. In particular, the publication cited a source as saying the V8 would require “significant structural changes” as well as a “fresh round of crash testing and regulatory approval.” That’s a tough sell, especially when the fifth-generation C-Class debuted over four years ago and a successor likely isn’t too far off. However, not all is lost as the upcoming CLE 63 lineup is slated to use a flat-plane-crank twin-turbo V8.",
