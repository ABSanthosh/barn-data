  "description": "This 1992 Porsche 911 Carrera RS is a left-hand-drive Japanese-market model that spent the last decade in Europe, and it was brought to the US in February 2024. It is powered by a 3.6-liter flat-six mated to a five-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential and is finished in Guards Red over black and Pearl Grey multi-tone leather. Equipment includes a seam-welded chassis, an aluminum front trunk lid, a speed-activated rear spoiler, magnesium 17″ Cup wheels, adjustable Bilstein coilovers, fixed-back Recaro bucket seats, and a Blaupunkt San Francisco CD stereo. The car was previously listed on BaT in April 2024 but was withdrawn due to mechanical issues, and it was acquired by the selling dealer in September 2024. This 964 911 Carrera RS shows 52k kilometers (~32k miles) and is now offered at no reserve in Tennessee with the owner's manual, service records, Japanese export paperwork, import documents, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Oregon title.",

It is powered by a 3.6-liter flat-six mated to a five-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential and is finished in Guards Red over black and Pearl Grey multi-tone leather. Equipment includes a seam-welded chassis, an aluminum front trunk lid, a speed-activated rear spoiler, magnesium 17″ Cup wheels, adjustable Bilstein coilovers, fixed-back Recaro bucket seats, and a Blaupunkt San Francisco CD stereo. The car was previously listed on BaT in April 2024 but was withdrawn due to mechanical issues, and it was acquired by the selling dealer in September 2024. This 964 911 Carrera RS shows 52k kilometers (~32k miles) and is now offered at no reserve in Tennessee with the owner’s manual, service records, Japanese export paperwork, import documents, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Oregon title. The Carrera RS was reintroduced with the 964 chassis and featured a seam-welded bodyshell as well as an aluminum front trunk lid, rolled fenders, and thinner side and rear windows than those used on the standard Carrera. This example is finished in Guards Red (L80K) and features faux fog lights, side marker lamps, dual side mirrors, and a speed-activated rear spoiler. The license plate light was repaired and the hood latch handle replaced in preparation for the sale. Magnesium 17″ Cup wheels are mounted with Yokohama Advan Sport V105 tires. The Carrera RS features a lowered and stiffened suspension with adjustable Bilstein coilovers as well as adjustable front and rear sway bars. Stopping power is provided by an anti-lock system featuring four-piston calipers over cross-drilled rotors at all four corners. The cockpit features fixed-back Recaro bucket seats trimmed in black and Pearl Grey multi-tone leather. The passenger window is powered, and the car was delivered from the factory without airbags, air conditioning, carpeting, or sound-deadening material. A Blaupunkt San Francisco CD stereo has been added along with speakers in the door panels. The pedal pads and one of the seat rails were replaced in 2024. The leather-wrapped RS-script steering wheel frames a central tachometer, a 300-km/h speedometer, a clock, and gauges for fuel level, oil level, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The six-digit odometer shows 52k kilometers (~32k miles). The 3.6-liter M64/03 flat-six was equipped from the factory with a lightened flywheel and was rated at 260 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque. Additional features include a sport-tuned Bosch engine management system and a cooling fan driven by a single belt. Work in March 2024 included an oil change and replacing the air filter, fuel filter, engine undertray, and lid struts. The blower motor was reportedly replaced following the April 2024 BaT auction, and the drivebelts were replaced by the selling dealer. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a G50 five-speed manual transaxle that features steel synchronizers, closer ratios than the standard Carrera, and an asymmetrical limited-slip differential. The Carfax report shows no accidents or damage from an initial entry in March 2024. Filed under: 964 You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
