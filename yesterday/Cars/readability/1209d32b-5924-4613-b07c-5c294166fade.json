  "text": "Apr 13, 2025 10:05 AM EDTA secretive startup with big names behind it A mysterious two-seat electric pickup truck spotted in Los Angeles may offer a glimpse at one of the most audacious EV projects in years — a $25,000 compact truck being developed by Slate Auto, a secretive Michigan startup with deep Amazon ties and backing from Jeff Bezos himself. While most electric vehicle companies aim high with luxury sedans and six-figure SUVs, Slate is flipping the script. Its first vehicle — confirmed by sources familiar with the company’s design — is intended to be a no-frills, affordable EV, designed more like the Ford Model T than a Tesla. The boxy, upright prototype seen recently in Los Angeles could be the first public sighting of that concept, which has been shown to investors at a design studio in Long Beach. A $25,000 pickup aiming to disrupt the market Slate Auto emerged from stealth in 2022, incubated within Re:Build Manufacturing, a firm co-founded by ex-Amazon Consumer CEO Jeff Wilke. Since then, the startup has quietly raised over $100 million, assembled a leadership team packed with veterans from Harley-Davidson, Stellantis, and GM, and reportedly closed a Series B round backed by billionaires Mark Walter and Thomas Tull. Oops! We’re unable to load this content right now.View directly on Reddit The project is backed not just by Bezos’s capital but also by a roster of former Amazon executives. Slate’s digital and e-commerce leads have roots in the retail giant, and the startup’s overall branding — including its original “Re:Car” moniker — echoes Amazon’s naming conventions. Beyond the truck: accessories and a DIY culture But beyond its secretive funding and corporate lineage, Slate’s approach stands out for its departure from the typical EV playbook. Instead of starting with a high-end model to build buzz and bank margins, Slate is gunning for a vehicle that could be someone’s “first car.” Its projected $25,000 price tag puts it far below most EVs on the market — and that’s by design. To make the numbers work, Slate plans to emulate the accessory-driven model used by Harley-Davidson and Stellantis’s Mopar division. Owners will be encouraged to customize and personalize their trucks, turning to a catalog of accessories, parts, and even apparel. Job listings suggest the company will also offer open-source repair and upgrade tutorials through something called “Slate University.” Production could begin as early as late 2026 at a facility near Indianapolis, though it’s still unclear if Slate plans to build a new factory or repurpose an existing one. The company has told employees it will outsource its high-voltage systems and motors, potentially speeding up development and lowering costs. Final thoughts At the helm is CEO Christine Barman, a Chrysler veteran who once oversaw programs for the Dodge Charger and Jeep Cherokee. Unlike the brash, tweet-happy founders who usually lead EV startups, Barman has flown under the radar, quietly building out Slate’s operations since 2022. With the EV market cooling and many startups either folding or flailing, Slate Auto’s gamble on an affordable, customizable truck feels risky but necessary. If successful, it could signal a shift toward a more accessible EV future — one where trucks aren’t luxury toys but tools anyone can own and personalize.",
