  "description": "This 1962 Ford Thunderbird is one of approximately 1,425 Sports Roadsters made for the model year. It is said to have previously resided in Seal Beach, California, where it has remained following its purchase by the seller's father in 2012. Finished in red over black crinkle leather, the car is powered by a 390ci V8 paired with a Cruise-O-Matic three-speed automatic transmission. Sports Roadsters were equipped with wire wheels, front fender badges, a passenger-side dashboard grab bar, and a fiberglass tonneau cover that covered the back seat of the car. Additional equipment includes a remote-operated power-retractable black soft top, power steering, power-adjustable front seats, power windows, air conditioning, and a cassette stereo. Work under current ownership has included repairing rust, rebuilding the transmission, and installing a replacement carburetor and exhaust system. This Thunderbird is now offered at no reserve with the owner's manual, service records, and a clean California title in the seller's name.",

  "text": "This 1962 Ford Thunderbird is one of approximately 1,425 Sports Roadsters made for the model year. It is said to have previously resided in Seal Beach, California, where it has remained following its purchase by the seller’s father in 2012. Finished in red over black crinkle leather, the car is powered by a 390ci V8 paired with a Cruise-O-Matic three-speed automatic transmission. Sports Roadsters were equipped with wire wheels, front fender badges, a passenger-side dashboard grab bar, and a fiberglass tonneau cover that covered the back seat of the car. Additional equipment includes a remote-operated power-retractable black soft top, power steering, power-adjustable front seats, power windows, air conditioning, and a cassette stereo. Work under current ownership has included repairing rust, rebuilding the transmission, and installing a replacement carburetor and exhaust system. This Thunderbird is now offered at no reserve with the owner’s manual, service records, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The car left the factory finished in Raven Black (A) and was previously refinished in its current shade of red. The power-retractable black soft top has been fitted with remote operation, and additional features include a fiberglass Sports Roadster tonneau cover, front fender badges, a windshield washer, dual side mirrors, and dual exhaust outlets below the rear bumper. Rust abatement was completed in the rocker panels, floor, frame rails, and bodywork in 2013, and touch-ups and a paint correction were performed in April 2022. Chrome-finished 14″ wire wheels wear spinner-style caps and are mounted with 215/75 American Classic thin-whitewall tires. A full-size spare is located in the trunk. The car came equipped from the factory with power steering, and stopping power is provided by power-assisted drum brakes at each corner. The power-adjustable front seats and a rear bench are upholstered in black crinkle leather (86), and stainless steel trim accents the console, instrument panel, door panels, and rear quarter trim panels. Amenities include power windows, lap belts, a center console, a MagicAire heater/defroster, air conditioning, and an aftermarket cassette stereo. The three-spoke steering wheel is mounted to a swing-away column and frames a 120-mph speedometer, an analog clock, and a single combination gauge for fuel level and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 62k miles, approximately 3k of which were added under current ownership. The 390ci V8 is equipped with a four-barrel carburetor that was replaced in 2019, and it features a chrome-plated air cleaner assembly, coolant overflow tank, and Thunderbird-branded valve covers. Factory-rated output was 300 horsepower. The valve cover gaskets were replaced in 2022, and a battery cut-off system has been installed. Power is routed to the rear wheels via a Cruise-O-Matic three-speed automatic transmission that was rebuilt in 2015. A replacement dual exhaust system was installed in 2019. Decoding the door tag reveals the following information: Body: 76B – Tudor Sports Roadster Color: A – Raven Black paint Trim: 86 – Black leather upholstery Date: 20B – Produced on the 20th day of February Axle: 1 – 3.00:1 (also noted as 3.56:1) Transmission: 4 – Three-speed Cruise-O-Matic 2Y89Z145772 2 – 1962 Y – Wixom, Michigan assembly plant 89 – Tudor Sports Roadster Z – 390ci V8 w/4-barrel carburetor 145772 – Production number The California title is listed as a duplicate.
