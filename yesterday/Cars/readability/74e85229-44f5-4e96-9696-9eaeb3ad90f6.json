  "text": "This Success Story comes to us from BaT member smiles11, who won this 1971 Porsche 911T from BordenAG in a November 2023 BaT auction: After regrettably selling my 1970 911E, it took years of searching to find the perfect longhood Porsche. My list of criteria was long: a lifetime California car with a numbers-matching engine and gearbox—a dogleg year, too—and it had to be finished in Light Ivory. My patience finally paid off, and my search came to an end with this car! I knew I was destined for this car when I saw the Moffett Field Naval Air Station stickers on the windshield dating back to 1979; my grandfather had been stationed there from 1978 to 1982! He was a C130 Crew Chief with the 129th ARRG (Air Rescue Recovery Group) Air National Guard, Moffett NAS (Naval Air Station). It turned out the first titled owner was my grandfather’s pilot! He had owned the car for nearly 50 years, and still lives close to us! He had purchased the car off a lease with around 25k miles in 1974 for $7,000.  It was a semi-daily driver for him as he commuted to Moffett Field NAS, and later turned it into his weekend driver. My grandfather gave him a call and caught up with him, and we are now planning a visit. The car’s history has brought my family together, and we look forward to uncovering more history with the original owner. David at BordenAG streamlined the entire process and made it a memorable experience for my wife and four-year-old son. Thank you! I had changed many diapers in the front seat of my old 1970 911E and took long, memorable road trips to Monterey along the Pacific Coast Highway. I could not wait to begin the new adventures with my family in this 1971 911T! First, I filled up and headed to meet with BaT member ronkain at IPB Autosport in Sacramento, California. And that’s where the fun began! At IPB, an oil change was performed, new control arm bushings, Koni rear shocks, and front inserts were installed, and a new set of period-correct ignition wires were fitted. I even purchased a matching-date (10/70) set of four deep-six Fuchs from Chris at 356WerksOC, and I added a period-correct original Porsche hood crest off the registry. Above is my son’s first joy ride in the car! This was on the way to the park and library in Valley Springs, California. And a wine-tasting date at my family’s winery, Ironstone Vineyards, in Murphys, California, was next up! I also took my family in the ’71 T to Laguna Seca back in May and had the car on track for the Porsche parade lap. It was an awesome time! I recently met with the longtime owner of 45 years at my family’s winery during the Ironestone Concours. Here’s Philip Henry and myself with the car at the event. It looks like you’re definitely racking up the miles and memories in your new 911T, smiles11!
