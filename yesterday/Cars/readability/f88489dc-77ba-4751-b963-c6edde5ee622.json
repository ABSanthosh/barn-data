  "text": "Published:  January 6th, 2025 Today's UCOTD is a 2002 BMW M5. This E39 has a six-speed manual transmission and about 174,000 miles on it. The seller says that it's in good shape, inside and out, with minimal wear. He also says that the mods are limited to LoJack, lighting, a USB setup for a dash cam, Bluetooth, hardlined Valentine 1 radar detector, dash-mounted cell-phone holder, and an aftermarket TPMS. The owner has done a lot of maintenance and repair work to keep this thing running well -- there's a long list at the original post that would take up too much space to list here. There are some minor issues, including a sunroof lift problem. If you're interested in this ride, it's available in California for $23,000.

Tim Healey grew up around the auto-parts business and has always had a love for cars — his parents joke his first word was “‘Vette”. Despite this, he wanted to pursue a career in sports writing but he ended up falling semi-accidentally into the automotive-journalism industry, first at Consumer Guide Automotive and later at Web2Carz.com. He also worked as an industry analyst at Mintel Group and freelanced for About.com, CarFax, Vehix.com, High Gear Media, Torque News, FutureCar.com, Cars.com, among others, and of course Vertical Scope sites such as AutoGuide.com, Off-Road.com, and HybridCars.com. He’s an urbanite and as such, doesn’t need a daily driver, but if he had one, it would be compact, sporty, and have a manual transmission. More by Tim Healey",
