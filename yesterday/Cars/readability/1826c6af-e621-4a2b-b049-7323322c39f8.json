That's right, your humble managing editor got up for work like usual and logged on like usual only to find out it's an off day. That said, we may have some fresh content for you. I ran our weekly Junkyard Find so that we can stay on schedule, and if news breaks, we'll be on it, assuming we aren't all too deep into spiked apple cider. Or just taking an autumn nap. I kid, of course. Today is one of those weird holidays where some people are off and some are not -- so to those of you who are in the office today while your kid isn't in school and your buddy who works at a bank is playing golf, you have my condolences.Oh, and more note -- while we return tomorrow, at least two of us are also traveling on industry events, so the posting schedule may be weird.

Tim Healey Tim Healey grew up around the auto-parts business and has always had a love for cars — his parents joke his first word was “‘Vette”. Despite this, he wanted to pursue a career in sports writing but he ended up falling semi-accidentally into the automotive-journalism industry, first at Consumer Guide Automotive and later at Web2Carz.com. He also worked as an industry analyst at Mintel Group and freelanced for About.com, CarFax, Vehix.com, High Gear Media, Torque News, FutureCar.com, Cars.com, among others, and of course Vertical Scope sites such as AutoGuide.com, Off-Road.com, and HybridCars.com. He’s an urbanite and as such, doesn’t need a daily driver, but if he had one, it would be compact, sporty, and have a manual transmission. More by Tim Healey",
