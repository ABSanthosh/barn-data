  "text": "Cool affordable cars have largely given way to boring trucks and SUVs April 18, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier Mainstream coupes and convertibles have fallen by the wayside in the past two decades. While they were stylish and affordable, many weren’t particularly sporty or fast. We’re asking our readers which mainstream cars were their favorites and what ones they miss. The carpocalypse hasn’t just killed sedans, it’s put the death knell on coupes and convertibles too. While there’s a new Mustang and Charger, the landscape has changed and fun has been in short supply. That didn’t used to be the case as automakers used to offer an assortment of cool mainstream cars. In fact, most major brands had a coupe based on a boring family sedan. More: Would You Actually Buy A Sedan? While these weren’t the most exciting things in the world, the Nissan Altima Coupe still looks good a decade later as does the Honda Accord Coupe. However, the Pontiac G6 Coupe and Convertible can stay forgotten in the past, although the latter was notable for featuring a retractable hard top. The Toyota Camry Solara was a bit of an eyesore, but who didn’t love the original Scion tC? Featuring a gorgeous design and an affordable price tag, it was easy to overlook the modest output of 160 hp (119 kW / 162 PS). Some relatively mainstream sedans also spiced things up. The Oldsmobile Aurora oozed cool over two generations, while the Swedes cranked out some beautiful and affordable sedans including the Volvo S40 and the second-generation Saab 9-3. More recently, Buick and Volkswagen took a stab at the convertible segment with the Cascada and Eos. Neither was particularly great, but there’s something magical about lowering the roof and letting your worries fade away. So, with all that nostalgia in mind, what do you think were some of the coolest mainstream cars? Or are we just remembering the good old days a little too fondly? What Are The Coolest Mainstream Cars? AND What Mainstream Car Do You Miss More Than You Expected?",
