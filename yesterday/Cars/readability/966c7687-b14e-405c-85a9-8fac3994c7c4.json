  "description": "This 1984 Ferrari 512 BBi is one of 1,007 fuel-injected examples produced during a four-year production run, and it was ordered through Garage Francorchamps in Brussels, Belgium in December 1983. The car was subsequently exported to Westlake Village, California in 1984, and it remained registered in the state before it was relocated to Washington in the 2010s and acquired by the current owner in 2017. Finished in Rosso Corsa over Nero leather, the car is powered by a 4.9-liter F110A flat-12 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Equipment consists of a limited-slip differential, fog lights, center-lock metric five-spoke wheels, Daytona-style seats, air conditioning, a Pioneer cassette stereo and graphic equalizer, and a gated shifter. This 512 BBi is now offered on dealer consignment with 1983 purchase invoices, service records, a tool kit, spare parts, a clean Carfax report, and a Washington title.",

The car was subsequently exported to Westlake Village, California in 1984, and it remained registered in the state before it was relocated to Washington in the 2010s and acquired by the current owner in 2017. Finished in Rosso Corsa over Nero leather, the car is powered by a 4.9-liter F110A flat-12 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Equipment consists of a limited-slip differential, fog lights, center-lock metric five-spoke wheels, Daytona-style seats, air conditioning, a Pioneer cassette stereo and graphic equalizer, and a gated shifter. This 512 BBi is now offered on dealer consignment with 1983 purchase invoices, service records, a tool kit, spare parts, a clean Carfax report, and a Washington title. Introduced at the 1971 Turin Auto Show, the Berlinetta Boxer model was styled by Pininfarina’s Leonardo Fioravanti. The car features a steel-paneled cabin section paired with a tubular chassis. Aluminum is incorporated for the front and rear clamshells and door panels, while the lower panels are fiberglass. The 512 BBi variant was introduced at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1981. The cars were not officially offered in the US and were imported and federalized in-period via the gray market. This example is finished in Rosso Corsa and features pop-up headlights, fog lights, a black-finished grille badge, a front spoiler, NACA side ducts, and quad exhaust outlets. Scrapes are noted on the lower portion of the front spoiler, scratches were touched up on the rear decklid under previous ownership, and photos of paint imperfections are viewable in the gallery below. The 512 BBi features a fully independent suspension with unequal-length double wishbones, coilovers up front, a double coilover setup out back, and anti-roll bars fore and aft. Center-lock 415mm five-spoke wheels are mounted with older 235/60 front and 255/60 rear BFGoodrich Radial T/A tires. Stopping power is provided by ventilated discs at all four corners. The selling dealer notes that the front and rear control arm bushings are showing signs of age. The cabin features Daytona-style seats upholstered in Nero leather along with a color-coordinated center console and door panels. Amenities include a gated dogleg shifter, air conditioning, a Pioneer cassette stereo, a graphic equalizer, and power windows. Wear is present on the outer left seat bolster, and the clock is inoperative. A three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 200-mph speedometer that was installed when the car was federalized. Additional Veglia instrumentation includes a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline as well as auxiliary gauges that extend to the center of the dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows 29k miles, approximately over 300 of which were added under current ownership. The 4.9-liter F110A flat-12 features Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection utilizing twin CIS fuel distributors and was factory rated at 340 horsepower. The distributor was rebuilt and the water pump was replaced in 2015, and work in 2021 included an engine-out timing belt service as well as replacing the front crankshaft seal, assorted gaskets and seals, filters, spark plugs, intake plenum seals, muffler mounts, and coolant pipes. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Headers and resonators were refinished in 2015. The clutch and the right axle flange were replaced in 2021. The December 1983 purchase invoice lists colors and an export destination of Westlake Village, California as well as a price of 1,400,000 Belgian francs. The 1984 importer label and a California Bureau of Automotive Repair engine identification tag are shown above, and a 2008 letter from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regarding the car’s importation to the US is viewable in the gallery. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other reported damage. The Washington state title lists a “Classic” brand. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
