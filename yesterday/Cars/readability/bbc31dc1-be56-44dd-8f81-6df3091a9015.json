The car has 6k miles and is further equipped with a mechanical limited-slip differential, black leather and cloth upholstery, a front-axle lift system, ceramic-composite brakes, LED-Matrix Design headlights with PDLS+, a speed-activated rear spoiler, rear-axle steering, the Touring Package in Black, Satin Neodyme-finished 20″ and 21″ center-locking wheels, carbon-fiber full bucket seats, Porsche Communication Management, automatic climate control, a Bose sound system, and cruise control. This 992 GT3 Touring was purchased by the owner in 2022 and is now offered on dealer consignment with the owner’s manual, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean California title. The car is finished in paint-to-sample Irish Green and was optioned with the Touring Package in Black, which added black window trim and rear Porsche lettering as well as a revised decklid with a mesh grille and a retractable rear spoiler in place of the raised wing found on the standard GT3. Additional details include LED-Matrix Design headlights with PDLS+, a rear fog light, rear parking sensors, and dual center-exit exhaust outlets. Paint protection film has been applied to the exterior, per the seller. Satin Neodyme-finished 20″ front and 21″ rear GT3 center-lock wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires. Stopping power is provided by Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) with yellow calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated discs at each corner. The car is equipped with a front-axle lift system and rear-axle steering. The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are trimmed in black leather with cloth inserts, while brushed aluminum trim accents the cabin. Interior appointments include Porsche Communication Management infotainment, navigation, a Bose sound system, puddle light projectors, automatic climate control, and cruise control. The GT3 sports steering wheel features a vehicle configuration dial and frames a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline as well as a digital speed readout and dual adjustable TFT screens. The digital odometer indicates 6k miles. The 4.0-liter flat-six features direct fuel injection, VarioCam variable valve timing, dry-sump lubrication, and individual throttle bodies. It was rated at 502 horsepower and 346 lb-ft of torque. The car was optioned with an extended range 23.7-gallon fuel tank, and it passed a California emissions inspection in February 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle with a mechanical limited-slip differential. The Carfax report lists at least one open recall. The California title carries a “title only” notation. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
