Custom ordered by its current owner, chassis 44 is finished in Dark Blue with a custom 1980s-style Ford Motorsport livery. Power comes from a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle, and equipment includes Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, gold-finished 19″ forged alloy wheels with Michelin slicks, adjustable DSSV shock absorbers, an air-jack system, a redesigned front splitter and rear diffuser, a dual-element rear wing, a roof-mounted intake for auxiliary cooling, two fixed-back Sparco race seats with harnesses, a roll cage, a cool-suit system, a carbon-fiber multifunction steering yoke, and a MoTeC data acquisition system. Now showing 41 miles, this Ford GT Mk II is offered in Saint Clair Township, Michigan, with Multimatic purchase paperwork, an order kit, and a bill of sale.",

  "text": "This 2023 Ford GT is the 44th of 45 examples of the track-only Mk II variant hand-built by Ford Performance and Multimatic Motorsports between 2020 and 2023. Custom ordered by its current owner, chassis 44 is finished in Dark Blue with a custom 1980s-style Ford Motorsport livery. Power comes from a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle, and equipment includes Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, gold-finished 19″ forged alloy wheels with Michelin slicks, adjustable DSSV shock absorbers, an air-jack system, a redesigned front splitter and rear diffuser, a dual-element rear wing, a roof-mounted intake for auxiliary cooling, two fixed-back Sparco race seats with harnesses, a roll cage, a cool-suit system, a carbon-fiber multifunction steering yoke, and a MoTeC data acquisition system. Now showing 41 miles, this Ford GT Mk II is offered in Saint Clair Township, Michigan, with Multimatic purchase paperwork, an order kit, and a bill of sale. The GT Mk II was developed in the spirit of the GT race cars campaigned by Ford in the FIA World Endurance Championship and IMSA, but with a track-day-only designation that freed its design from the constraints of racing’s sanctioning bodies or road-use regulations. The Mk II shared the carbon-fiber monocoque and much of its styling with the road-going Ford GT while featuring racing-oriented aerodynamic elements, a fixed-height lower suspension, a track-focused interior, and a more powerful version of the GT’s EcoBoost V6. Named as an homage to Ford’s 1966 Le Mans-winning GT40s, the GT Mk II was unveiled at the 2019 Goodwood Festival of Speed. This example is finished in Dark Blue and wears a custom #44 livery that was inspired by 1980s-era Ford Motorsport GTP race cars, a $95k factory option. Frozen White accents the nose and bodysides, along with Competition Orange, medium blue, and light blue accent stripes. Design elements include a fixed dual-plane rear wing, an extended front splitter, dive planes, louvered front fenders, a rear diffuser, gloss carbon-fiber mirror housings, and a roof-mounted air inlet that directs air through powertrain fluid coolers. Gold-finished 19″ forged alloy wheels made by Forgeline are wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport GT racing slicks. Stopping power is handled by Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes measuring 15.5″ up front and 14.1″ at the rear, with a retuned Bosch anti-lock braking system. The cabin features fixed carbon-shelled Sparco race seats trimmed in black cloth with wraparound headrests, GT embroidery, and black safety harnesses. Exposed carbon fiber is visible throughout, while the dash pad and pillars are trimmed in black Alcantara. Additional equipment includes model-specific carbon-fiber dash moldings, a rotary gear selector, drilled pedals, a cool-suit system, a fire-suppression system, and an FIA-compliant roll cage. The Multimatic carbon-fiber multifunction steering wheel is trimmed in Alcantara and sits in front of a 10” digital instrument screen that displays a speedometer and tachometer alongside oil temperature and pressure, coolant temperature, and boost pressure. A MoTeC data acquisition system provides vital information for the driver and doubles as a display for the rearview camera. The digital odometer shows 41 miles. The mid-mounted twin-turbocharged 3.5L EcoBoost V6 was factory rated at 700 horsepower, approximately 40 more than the road-going GT and 200 more than the factory GTLM race car. The Mk II received a high-capacity air-to-air outboard-mounted charge cooler with an ionized water spray that automatically activates during high-temperature situations, while auxiliary coolers for the gearbox, oil system, and clutch are fed via the roof-mounted scoop. Power is sent to the rear wheels by a Getrag seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. The removal of the electronically adjustable suspension is said to save approximately 200 pounds over a standard Ford GT and is replaced with five-way adjustable Multimatic DSSV two-stage dampers with high-speed blow-off, fixed-rate springs, and an air-jack system. Also specific to the Mark II are unique billet-machined uprights and redesigned tie-rod ends. The car does not have a title, as it is intended for track use only. It is being sold on a bill of sale.
