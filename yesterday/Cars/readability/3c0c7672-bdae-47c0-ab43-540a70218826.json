  "description": "This 1965 Alfa Romeo Giulia Sprint 1300 was built in November 1964 and delivered new to Madrid, Spain. Chassis AR385591 was subsequently brought to the US, where it underwent a repaint and an interior re-trim in the 1990s prior to installation of a 1.6L twin-cam inline-four in the early 2000s. The car is finished in blue and rides on Koni shocks along with 15\" Fergat-style wheels. Inside, the low-back front seats are trimmed in gray tweed with blue vinyl sides and are accompanied by a wood-rimmed Nardi steering wheel along with refurbished Veglia instrumentation. Shifting is through a five-speed manual transmission, and further equipment includes a cabin heater, a single Weber carburetor, and front disc brakes. This tipo 101.02 is now offered by the selling dealer with an Alfa Romeo Classiche Certificato di Origine, service records, historical photographs, and a clean North Carolina title.",

Chassis AR385591 was subsequently brought to the US, where it underwent a repaint and an interior re-trim in the 1990s prior to installation of a 1.6L twin-cam inline-four in the early 2000s. The car is finished in blue and rides on Koni shocks along with 15″ Fergat-style wheels. Inside, the low-back front seats are trimmed in gray tweed with blue vinyl sides and are accompanied by a wood-rimmed Nardi steering wheel along with refurbished Veglia instrumentation.

This tipo 101.02 is now offered by the selling dealer with an Alfa Romeo Classiche Certificato di Origine, service records, historical photographs, and a clean North Carolina title. The Giulietta was first introduced at the 1954 Turin Auto Show with the Bertone-designed Sprint coupe. The car soldiered on into the early 1960s before being renamed the Giulia for 1962. This example left the factory in Bluette and was repainted in 1992. The driver’s door received repairs following an accident in 2001, and the door handles were replaced in 2018. The selling dealer states the parking lights will intermittently remain on, and paint chips on the around the exterior can be seen up close in the gallery. Fergat-style 15″ wheels are mounted with 155-series Michelin XAS Radial tires with 2018 production date codes, and a spare with an older Michelin tire is stored in the trunk. The car rides on Koni shocks that were fitted during a suspension overhaul in 2002, while stopping power is provided by front disc and rear drum brakes. The front calipers and pistons were replaced along with the upper and lower ball joints, tie rods, and track rod ends in September 2018. The low-back front bucket seats are upholstered in gray tweed with blue vinyl sides and piping, and color-coordinated upholstery extends to the dash, rear bench, and door cards. The seat cushions and carpets were replaced in 1998 and the dashboard was repainted in 2001. A cabin heater, a dash-mounted rearview mirror, front lap belts, and Coco floor mats are additional interior features. A wood-rimmed Nardi steering wheel fronts Veglia instrumentation consisting of a tachometer with an inset oil pressure readout flanked by a 200-km/h speedometer and a combination gauge. The instruments were refurbished in March 2007, while work in October 2018 involved repairing the steering wheel as well as replacing the steering wheel wiring, headlight relay, and turn signal switch. The five-digit odometer now shows 4k kilometers (~3k miles), and the selling dealer states that true mileage is unknown. The  1.6L twin-cam inline-four is said to have been rebuilt before being installed in place of the factory 1.3L unit under previous ownership in the early 2000s. The Weber carburetor was rebuilt in October 2018, while work on the cylinder head in December 2018 involved replacing the valves and exhaust seals as well as setting the valve clearances. Further service performed between September 2018 and March 2020 included replacing the gaskets for the oil pan, valve cover, and intake manifold as well as the thermostat, upper radiator hose, spark plugs, and rear main cap seals. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission that is said to have been rebuilt in 2003. The differential was serviced in December 2018. The Certificato di Origine from Alfa Romeo Classiche lists a production date of November 18, 1964, as well as delivery to Madrid, Spain, on January 15, 1965, and shows the factory Bluette paint color.
