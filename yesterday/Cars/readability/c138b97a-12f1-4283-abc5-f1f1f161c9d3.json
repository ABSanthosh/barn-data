Showing 32k miles, the car is powered by a 4.9-liter flat-12 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Rosso Corsa over beige Connolly leather upholstery. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, 16″ five-spoke alloy wheels, pop-up headlights, an Alpine CD stereo, air conditioning, power windows, and a gated shifter. This Testarossa is offered with a toolkit, two keys, a car jack, a map light, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean California title in the name of the seller’s company. The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Rosso Corsa and features pop-up headlights, fog lights, an asymmetrical cooling duct beneath the left fog lamp, side intake strakes, black-finished rocker panels, and quad exhaust outlets. Paint correction was performed and the front spoiler, rockers, and door locks were refinished in 2025. Silver 16″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with BFGoodrich g-Force tires. Braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated discs. The cockpit is trimmed in beige Connolly leather upholstery over the seats, door panels, and lower dashboard. Interior amenities include an Alpine CD stereo, motorized seat belts, and a gated shifter located on the center console alongside an aftermarket radar detector and controls for the air conditioning and power windows. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames Veglia instrumentation, including a 200-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,800-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil pressure and coolant temperature. A clock and auxiliary gauges for fuel level and oil temperature are housed in the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 32k miles. The 4.9-liter flat-12 was factory rated at 380 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque. The alternator was replaced and the air conditioning was recharged in 2025. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The underside was treated with dry ice in preparation for the sale. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage and lists at least one open recall. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
