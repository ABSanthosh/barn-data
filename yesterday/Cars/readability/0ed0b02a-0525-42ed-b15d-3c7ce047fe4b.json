  "description": "First up, props to Skoda for organising a night drive in Mumbai as part of the new Kodiaq’s media introduction. Mumbai’s historic areas and new roads are best experienced in the calm and quiet of the after hours, and the event presented the opportunity to get some meaningful driving over roads very familiar to us. The Kodiaq, for those who may not know, is a relatively large three-row SUV from Skoda’s global portfolio. It's a big deal for the Czech carmaker with the first-gen model raking up sales of over 9,00,000 units worldwide, 10,000 of which went to buyers in India. Skoda wants to add to that tally significantly with this second-gen model. Skoda Kodiaq Exterior Design and Engineering - 8/10 Familiar elements sit amidst new-gen Skoda design New Kodiaq's styling is evolutionary with modern treatment to individual elements. The new Kodiaq is easily identifiable as a Kodiaq, at least when viewed head-on. Styling up front is an evolution with a modern treatment to individual elements. The bonnet is more sculpted and adds visual volume to the front. You will also find a larger interpretation of Skoda's traditional octagonal grille, this time around embellished with an LED light strip that flows into the headlight DRLs. The headlights sport a split look with the main cluster up top beautifully detailed with a crystal-like effect. Effective LED lighting is standard, but interestingly, matrix LEDs with more precise light control could be offered in the future. Lower down, there's a neat air intake flanked by air curtains that are among many elements that have helped aerodynamics. I do wish the quest for enhanced aero didn't extend to the wheels. The 18-inch wheels have a concealed look and appear unexciting.  Grille is embellished with an LED strip that flows into the LED DRLs. Squared-out wheel arches are a link to the original model, but it's in profile that the Kodiaq's design and styling evolution is most apparent. Where the last one was all about crisp creases and straight lines, the new Kodiaq's surfacing is an interplay of soft contours and well-defined elements. While the 2,791mm wheelbase is common to Gen 1 and Gen 2 Kodiaqs, overall length is up 59mm. The length increase concentrated at the rear overhang gives the new model an elongated look, and the upswept rear quarter glass that sits flush with the contrast dark chrome panel on the D pillar is a very clear point of distinction too. Wide tail-lamps with a C-shaped LED light signature define the tail end. Interestingly, while the lights are linked, the middle section doesn't illuminate.  18-inch alloys with an aero-optimised design look unexciting. The Skoda Kodiaq uses a monocoque construction and uses the Volkswagen Group's MQB Evo platform, which is the latest iteration of the modular MQB platform. The Skoda Kushaq and Slavia, for reference, are based on the ‘Indian-ised’ MQB A0 IN. Skoda Kodiaq interior space and comfort - 8.5/10 Plush cabin feels worthy of price tag.  Open the Kodiaq's doors and you'll like the carpet of light (floor projection) that welcomes you on board. And while not all too apparent in the dark, you'll appreciate the presence of door edge protectors that pop out to keep neighbouring vehicles scratch-free in tight parkings. The Kodiaq’s interior will instantly win you over. The high quality materials (padded surfaces and ash wood on the dash, for instance) and great attention to detail (the knurled effect on knobs and controls is particularly nice) deliver the all-important sensation of being in an expensive car. A stylish winged dashboard and tastefully done ambient lighting help to this end.  Kodiaq's cabin feels high quality and has great attention to detail. The Kodiaq also scores highly on comfort, especially for those sat up front. The well cushioned front seats are not only large and accommodating but also pack in heating, ventilation and massage (it’s really good) functions. Second row occupants have it nice too. There’s enough room for three average-sized adults to sit comfortably and even six footers will be content on knee room. The middle row can be slid forwards and backwards to balance space for the third row of passengers. It’s a pity the flip-down neck supports haven’t been included on the new-gen Kodiaq. Middle row has enough space for three passengers. Third row is tight but useable over short commutes Access to the third row via a small passage between the body and middle row seats (they don’t flip forwards) is inconvenient and space at the very back is simply tight for large adults. However, sit size-wise across the Kodiaq’s three rows, and it's possible to work out a reasonable compromise for short intra-city commutes. Spend time in a Kodiaq and you’ll also appreciate how well thought out its cabin is. With gear selection duties relegated to a stalk behind the steering wheel, the centre console is freed up to offer loads of space for small items. There are two wireless charging pads, four cupholders and a large centre box between the seats. Dual gloveboxes and sizeable door pockets (felt-lined, no less) are other storage spaces on offer up front. Tablet/mobile phone holders for the middle row are a clever inclusion, and Skoda has also packed in a handy removable storage box that mounts conveniently on the centre tunnel.  Space in the third row is tight for large adults. Remember the longer rear overhang I mentioned earlier? You see the benefit of that when you open the powered and gesture-controlled tailgate. With all seats up, there's 281 litres of luggage space, up 11 litres on the older Kodiaq. The 50:50 split third row seats fold flat to free up to 786 litres of luggage room while the second row seats split 40:20:40 and fold flat to unlock a massive 1,976 litres. Again, the boot area is well thought out and includes detachable holders to keep your luggage in place. Before you ask, there's an enclosure for a space saver spare tyre packaged under the boot floor.  Boot has 281-litres of space with all rows up, extentable up to 1976-litres. Skoda Kodiaq performance and refinement - 9/10 Exciting 204hp turbo-petrol engine will liven up everyday drives. The new-gen Kodiaq has been launched in India with a 204hp, 320Nm 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine. The older Kodiaq put out 190hp; torque was the same 320Nm. All-wheel drive is standard with drive channeled through a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Also in consideration for India is the Kodiaq RS with a 265hp version of the same petrol engine and a 2.0-litre diesel. Yes, diesel is a possibility too. However, those are stories for another day. Let's focus on the version you can buy today. The news is good. Crisp responses make the 2.0-litre TSI engine feel alert and alive. The energetic engine is ever ready with a nice dose of power and makes the large Kodiaq feel light on its feet. The Skoda is quick to build speed and performance on the whole is very satisfying. As an added plus, the engine sounds quite nice too. The gravelly note at lower speeds gets throatier as you go faster and makes for a playful soundtrack. 204hp, 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine feels energetic and alive. While you see the Kodiaq in its best light on open roads, slow-moving traffic can reveal some rough edges. Like many other dual-clutch units, the gearbox tends to feel a bit clunky at low speeds. Things do smoothen out as you build speed. There's a sport mode and you also get paddle shifters for times when you want to take manual control. Skoda Kodiaq mileage - 6/10 Petrol-only Kodiaq is not most efficient option for the money.    The Skoda Kodiaq features auto stop/start to help economy but makes do without any form of hybrid assistance. Its official ARAI-tested fuel economy of 14.86kpl is an improvement over the last model's 12.78kpl official figure. However, the fact is, you'd be lucky to see double-digit figures in congested city driving. Then again, that's true for most SUVs with large turbo-petrol engines. Skoda Kodiaq ride comfort and handling - 7.5/10 Suspension setup feels a touch firm over potholes.  The Kodiaq offers 155mm of laden ground clearance (with a full load of passengers), so you won't have issues on big speed breakers. As for ride comfort, there is a firmness to the suspension setup, and it doesn't quite smoothen out our uneven surfaces. It’s not to the extent of being a reason for complaint, though.  Without the DCC, new Kodiaq doesn't feel as composed as the old one. A thing to bring up is that the new-gen Kodiaq doesn't get damper control like the last model did. That’s a shame because there is a bit more vertical movement at high speeds, giving the impression that the new Kodiaq is not quite as tied down as the earlier model was. Good manoeuvrability makes large Kodiaq easy to live with.    In other ways, the Skoda drives like a typical VW Group car. High speed handling is neat and tidy, while at lower speeds, the light steering makes the large Kodiaq feel quite manoeuverable and easy to live with. All-wheel drive does its work in the background but we’ll need the Kodiaq for a longer duration to put the system to the test. Skoda Kodiaq features and safety - 8.5/10 It packs in all the creature comforts you'd want but ADAS is missed. The Skoda Kodiaq is available in two variants. Featured here is the top-end L\u0026K in the new bronze gold metallic paint shade. There's also the option of a Sportline trim that trades many chrome details for gloss black, wears different 18-inch rims and also features a blacked-out D pillar that collectively lend the SUV a sportier vibe. Sportline versions are predominantly black inside and feature leatherette and suede upholstery. A three-spoke steering and sporty front seats with integrated headrests are also unique to the Sportline.  Front seats on the L\u0026K trim get a massage function. The fully loaded Skoda Kodiaq L\u0026K is more traditional luxury car in its exterior and interior treatment. The L\u0026K is also the only one to get front seat ventilation and massage, a 360-degree camera and auto park. Both versions of the Kodiaq pack in goodies like a panoramic sunroof, 3-zone climate control, an onboard air purifier, rear window shades, sweet 725W, 13-speaker Canton sound system and 10.25-inch digital dials. The Virtual Cockpit display – as Skoda calls it – includes a full map view, though it’ll only relay info from the onboard navigation and not Google Maps through a connected phone. Virtual cockpit relays info only from onboard navigation.  Delivering the big screen experience is the 13-inch touchscreen. It is a large screen, yes, but it has been incorporated well into the dash to not appear too in your face. The screen is super smooth and ticks the essential boxes with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Shortcut buttons in easy access and large icons make the screen user-friendly but what makes the biggest difference is that not all functions are bundled on to the touchscreen. Separate physical knobs for driver and passenger side temperature and seat heating/cooling are included and there’s also a third knob that can uniquely be programmed with four additional functions. Pressing down on the knob toggles to the next function which can then be controlled via a turn. In effect, you can use the same knob for volume control, drive mode selection, blower speed settings and map zoom. The tactile feel counts for a lot and greatly reduces the need to look away from the road to adjust oft used functions, and resultantly enhances how you interact with your vehicle. On the subject, Skoda has also packaged in a screen cleaner housed within the centre console to remove fingerprints and smudges. People with OCD will approve.  Central rotary dial is configurable for volume, fan speed, map zoom and drives modes.  The Skoda Kodiaq has not been rated by Bharat NCAP or Global NCAP as yet, but there's comfort in knowing it's a Euro NCAP 5-star rated car. In terms of safety kit, the Skoda Kodiaq for India packs in nine airbags, including one between the front passengers. There's ESC, hill descent control, ISOFIX child seat mounts, and more. Unfortunately, there's no advanced driver assistance systems or ADAS, at least for the moment. The Volkswagen Group is working on ADAS for India, but a timeline for rollout of these features hasn't been announced. Panoramic sunroof gets a thin sunshade, but it doesn't block much heat on a hot day.   Skoda Kodiaq price and verdict - 8.5/10 Skoda has priced the Kodiaq Sportline at Rs 46.89 lakh, while the L\u0026K variant costs Rs 48.69 lakh (ex-showroom). That’s not only a substantial price jump over the last-gen model (Rs 37 lakh) but also makes the Kodiaq significantly pricier than the Hyundai Tucson (Rs 29 lakh-36 lakh) which is the go-to model in the premium SUV segment. However, the Kodiaq does go one up on the Tucson as well as its recently launched cousin, the new gen Volkswagen Tiguan, with a third row of seats. The third row isn’t great, but brings in a seating flexibility that many buyers will value. The bigger draw is the premium experience the Kodiaq delivers. Talk interior quality or drive experience, the Skoda feels like an expensive European vehicle. In fact, objectively speaking, the Kodiaq is a more wholesome package than the entry luxury SUV offerings from Mercedes, BMW and Audi. See it in this light, and you’ll find a compelling proposition in the new-gen Kodiaq.   Also see: 2025 Skoda Kodiaq walkaround video",
