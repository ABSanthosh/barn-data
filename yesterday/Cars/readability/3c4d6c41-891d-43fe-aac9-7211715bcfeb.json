  "text": "This 1965 Jaguar XKE Series I roadster was acquired by the seller and restored in 2025. Work included rebuilding the 4.2-liter inline-six, replacing the wiring, repainting the car in Opalescent Golden Sand, and retrimming the interior in black leather. Equipment includes a four-speed manual transmission, a limited-slip differential, a black soft top, enclosed headlights, 15″ knock-off wire wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, an alloy radiator, and triple SU carburetors. This Series I XKE is now offered with a Jaguar Heritage Trust Certificate, an owner’s manual, and an Arizona title in the seller’s name. The Series I E-Type features covered headlights and taillights mounted above the chrome rear bumpers. The body of this example was refinished in Opalescent Golden Sand as part of the restoration, at which time the glass was replaced. Additional equipment includes a replacement black soft top, a soft top boot, a louvered clamshell hood, wraparound chrome bumpers, bright trim, a driver-side mirror, triple windshield wipers, and dual exhaust outlets. The 15″ chrome knock-off wire wheels are secured by two-eared spinners and were installed during the restoration. They are mounted with 195/70 Vredestein tires. The car is equipped with a four-wheel independent suspension, and stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes with inboard-mounted rear rotors. The cabin was re-trimmed during the restoration and features bucket seats upholstered in black leather along with color-coordinated door panels and carpets. Interior appointments include black vinyl dash trim, a sliding rearview mirror, and a heater. The wood-rimmed steering wheel frames Smiths instrumentation including a 160-mph speedometer and a 6k-rpm tachometer, while auxiliary gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel level, and amperage are located in the center of the dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows approximately 38k miles, about 20 of which have been added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown. The 4.2-liter inline-six was rebuilt during the restoration and features triple SU carburetors, polished camshaft covers, and an alloy radiator with a 16″ electric fan. The wiring was also replaced. Photos of the cylinder head stamping, chassis stamping, and chassis tag are provided in the gallery. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a full-synchromesh four-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. A stainless-steel exhaust system was installed during the restoration. A Jaguar Heritage Trust certificate is included in the sale. A close-up image is provided in the gallery. The current title carries a Not Actual Mileage odometer notation.
