  "text": "Thousands of PHEV models are equipped with a battery module that could short circuit and cause a thermal runaway 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Volvo is recalling 7,483 plug-in hybrids in the United States due to a fire risk. The recall impacts multiple vehicles including the S60, V60, S90, V90, XC60, and XC90. Dealers will replace the battery module, if needed, and install new monitoring software. Volvo is recalling thousands of plug-in hybrids in the United States as they could short circuit when parked and fully charged. This poses a serious fire risk and it could occur at night, when the vehicle is parked in your garage. That’s a scary thought and owners are being advised not to charge their vehicles until the recall has been addressed. It impacts 7,483 cars, crossovers, and wagons including plug-in hybrid versions of the 2020-2021 S90, 2022 V90, and 2020-2022 S60, V60, XC60, and XC90. More: 2026 Volvo XC60 Gets Another Refresh After 9 Years On The Market Delving deeper into the matter, Volvo identified a “production deviation with the battery module” that could potentially lead to a thermal runaway event. Specifics are hazy, but the batteries were made by LG and may experience an internal short circuit within certain battery cells. Volvo first became aware of the issue after a customer reported a “thermal event” on February 6 of 2024. This sparked an investigation, which wrapped up earlier this month. The company is apparently aware of two incidents related to the condition, although neither resulted in any injuries, crashes, or fatalities.

Once there, technicians will conduct an inspection to identify cell deviations within the battery module. If any are found, the battery module will be replaced free of charge. All vehicles will also be equipped with new software that monitors the battery module.",
