  "text": "Douglas Sacha/Getty Images Heat is one of the biggest threats to your vehicle's drivetrain. I'm not talking the regular heat an engine makes when it's running, here. No, I'm talking excessive, piston-melting, gear-seizing heat caused by lubricant loss or some kind of catastrophic mechanical failure. It's not just engines that can overheat and destroy themselves: Transmissions are also vulnerable to heat damage, what with all the spinning gears and rods and other mechanical gewgaws in there. Now, we know that a vehicle's engine typically runs between 160 and 180 degrees by Fahrenheit's thermometer, with an upper safe range over 200 degrees. What about a transmission, though? How hot does a normally operating transmission usually run? How high is its operational safe range?  In general, the safe heat range for a vehicle's transmission is roughly the same as the safe heat range of its engine — between 175 and 225 degrees Fahrenheit. Anything more than that and you're looking at damage to the transmission's internals. How hot is too hot, though, and what happens (heaven forfend) when a transmission overheats?  Gotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade hodim/Shutterstock A transmission can overheat for the same reasons that an engine overheats, and the most common cause is poor maintenance. When was the last time you checked your transmission fluid? Heck, when was the last time you even thought of it? Trans fluid breaks down and wears out over time, which makes it less effective at both lubricating and cooling. Driving in hot environments or in stop and go traffic (or both) can also overheat a gearbox. Towing is another potential cause of transmission overheating, along with carrying excessively heavy loads. An overheating transmission will slip, bang, make weird noises, hesitate, and smell awful. If your vehicle exhibits any of those behaviors pull over ASAP and check your transmission fluid. If the fluid is low, discolored, or smells burned, let the vehicle cool down a bit and then get it to the shop without delay. If you're lucky, you'll just need a transmission flush and some fresh fluid to fix the problem. If you want to keep your transmission from overheating, your best bet is a transmission cooler, which is like a tiny radiator just for your gearbox. A lot of cars come with them, especially high-performance cars or towing rigs, but you can usually get one from the aftermarket and have it installed if that wasn't the case. Other than that, make sure you keep your vehicle maintenance up to date and try not to stress your transmission out too much, and you should be free from transmission overheating problems.",
