  "text": "Ford has been confronting so many recalls this year that it’s getting hard to keep up with them. This one is relatively minor in terms of overall safety concerns, but relevant in terms of scope. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the automaker has recalled 132,914 examples of the Lincoln Aviator over pieces of the vehicle falling off.The issue stems from a lack of adhesive bonding on the rear door’s window bars and C-pillar trim. If improperly installed, these pieces run the risk of detaching. The safety concerns come into play due to the fact that this is most likely to happen when the vehicle is in motion. Obviously, you don’t want bits of your SUV falling off and striking another automobile or (worst case) someone riding a motorcycle. Relevant to the recall are “certain” examples of the Lincoln Aviator from the 2020-2025 model years. However, it doesn’t seem to come down to individual trims and is instead reliant on the defective parts — which would have been installed on SUVs assembled between October of 2018 and May of 2025. Based upon the NHTSA report, parts came from a tier-one supplier in Mexico named Cooper Standard Automotive Inc. However, we don’t know if Ford installed the part incorrectly or there was a manufacturing defect from the supplier. Regardless, Blue Oval claims to have caught wind of the problem in April of this year. An internal investigation followed, revealing over 1,000 warranty claims of the C-pillar applique or division bar falling off vehicles globally. Ford’s Field Review Committee reviewed the concern and approved a field action at the start of June and is now working on a recall with the NHTSA. The automaker said it was unaware of any injuries or crashes related to the issue.Owners will be notified by mail and instructed to take their vehicle to a Ford or Lincoln dealer to have the C-Pillar appliques and window division bars repaired or replaced. Obviously, there will be no charge for this service. Formal notifications should be sent to owners starting on July 28th and all the relevant VINs should be searchable by the 22nd of July (once dealers have been notified). Concerned customers may contact Ford Customer Service hotline at 1-866-436-7332. Ford's number for this recall is 25S66. The NHTSA will likewise allow owners to search using their VIN or its own recall campaign number (25V407000). However, any Lincoln Aviator from the 2020-2025 model year is likely to be included in the recall. [Images: Ford Motor Co.]Become a TTAC insider.
