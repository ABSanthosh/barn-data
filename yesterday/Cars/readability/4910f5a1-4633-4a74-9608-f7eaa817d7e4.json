  "text": "At an event like the Essen Motor Show, brimming with wildly modified cars, it’s hard for a subtle-looking build to stand out. But when I saw this white-on-white BNR32 Nissan Skyline GT-R at this year’s event, I couldn’t help but stop and stare. At first glance, it appears to be just another Skyline, and, in a sense, it is. But as I looked closer, the car’s story began to reveal itself. Luckily, its owner of 14 years, Phillip Berndt, was on hand to walk me through the details while I snapped away. The first thing that struck me about the Skyline is the fact it’s been restored by Markenstein Fahrzeugtechnik – a Porsche specialist based in Alsdorf, Germany – quite an unexpected choice. Mechanically speaking, it’s as fresh as the day it rolled off Nissan’s production line. But it’s more than just a restoration. The Skyline also features a powertrain upgrade with N1-spec turbos, an ARC Group A air filter, an HKS EVC5 boost controller, and more. The result is a healthy 450hp, a notable bump from the factory 280hp. The exterior is subtly enhanced with an Abflug carbon fiber front splitter, Group-A-style carbon front bumper vents, N1 headlights, and a Top Secret rear diffuser. Custom K-Sport airbag struts paired with Air Lift Performance 3H management gives the R32 an ultra low stance when parked. To complete the look, the car sits on ultra-rare, white Nismo LMGT1 wheels, chosen to match the bodywork’s Crystal White paint. As part of the restoration, every emblem and sticker on the car has been replaced with new OEM parts, ensuring it retains that factory-fresh feel. There are a couple of extra details I had to photograph – one being Akira Nakai’s autograph on the spoiler, and the other an original Nismo sticker on the Fujimura Auto rocket flap. At the end of the shoot, Phillip suggested I check out another of his cars at the show – a Puma-liveried Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VII. “They are completely different cars, but if you park them together, you’ll realize that they belong to the same owner,” Phillip told me, referring to the shared details across both cars. Sure enough, I noticed the R32-style Gurney flap on the Evo’s wing, adorned with a Ralliart badge in the same spot where the Nismo logo graces the GT-R. When Phillip mentioned that the Evo is fitted with Nismo LMGT4 wheels to match the R32’s LM GT1s, I was skeptical. But upon seeing the car, I was impressed. The 40th Anniversary Edition wheels, with their polished lips, are a nice match for the Evo’s livery. The only connection I couldn’t verify between the two cars was in the interior, where Phillip explained that both share similar carpets and chrome harness bars. What I admire most about this R32 Skyline GT-R is the attention to detail. It exudes the clean, precise aesthetic often associated with the German tuning scene but applied to a true JDM performance car icon.
