The 4.0-liter flat-six drives the rear wheels via a seven-speed PDK transaxle with Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV) and a mechanically locking differential. The car is further equipped with the Light Design and Chrono packages as well as CFRP full bucket seats and LED headlights with PDLS+. The current owner recently purchased the car, and it now has 2,900 miles. This 718 Cayman GT4 RS is now offered on dealer consignment with a window sticker, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title. The 718 GT4 RS features lightweight rear glass, vented front fenders, additional upper intakes, and a larger swan-neck rear wing when compared with the contemporary 718 GT4. Weissach Package-equipped cars are denoted by titanium tailpipes as well as exposed carbon-fiber weave on the hood, intakes, side mirror housings, and wing. This example is finished in Paint-to-Sample Grey Black, a $12,830 option, and is fitted with LED headlights with the Porsche Dynamic Lighting System Plus (PDLS+) as well as ParkAssist rear parking sensors, integrated dual exhaust outlets, and auto-dimming mirrors with an integrated rain sensor. Optional $15,640 forged magnesium 20″ wheels are finished in silver and are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. A $3,040 front-axle lift system was optioned from the factory as were $8,000 Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) with High-Gloss Black Porsche-branded calipers. The CFRP full bucket seats are upholstered in Black leather and Arctic Grey Race-Tex complemented by Arctic Grey “Weissach RS” headrest embroidery, stitching, and seatbelts. Further appointments comprise a Bose surround-sound system, Race-Tex-wrapped sun visors, a leather steering column casing, carbon-fiber trim, PCM infotainment with navigation, and illuminated GT4 RS-branded carbon-fiber door sill guards. A fire extinguisher is mounted in the passenger footwell, and the optional Light Design Package added LED lighting in the overhead console, door handles, door storage compartments, footwells, and vanity mirrors. The Race-Tex-wrapped steering wheel features a yellow centering stripe as well as shift paddles and fronts a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline flanked by a 200-mph speedometer and a configurable digital display. The optional Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 2,900 miles. The mid-mounted 4.0L flat-six was factory rated at 493 horsepower and 331 lb-ft of torque. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle, and the car is equipped with Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV) and a mechanically locking differential. A Sport exhaust system was equipped as standard. The window sticker notes initial delivery to Porsche of the Main Line in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, and lists factory equipment, colors, options, and a total price of $214,130. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage and notes at least one manufacturer voluntary service action. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
