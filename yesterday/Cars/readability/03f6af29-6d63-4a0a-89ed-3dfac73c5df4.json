  "text": "Authorities report that the chase included speeds above 100 mph and that the driver had a 19-year-old passenger October 20, 2024 at 21:01 by Stephen Rivers Police chased what they say was a stolen Chevrolet Corvette on Saturday night. Ultimately, the car crashed after police used a spike strip to pop one of the tires. Officers then found a 15-year-old boy driving the car with a 19-year-old passenger. What started as a routine evening for San Bernardino Police quickly spiraled into a high-speed pursuit involving a stolen sports car and a pair of teenagers. The pursuit began Saturday night when officers spotted a reportedly stolen Chevrolet Corvette, and it escalated to the point where the California Highway Patrol had to take over. When it ended, after a spike strip, popped tires, and a crash, officers found two teens in the car including a driver who is just 15. Evidently, the chase began in Hesperia, California just before 10 p.m. when the driver allegedly sped away from a traffic stop. A news helicopter picked up the chase on the I-10 westbound near exit 31B in Baldwin Park, California. According to the agency, the chase included speeds above 100 mph (160 km/h). At some point during the incident, officers used a spike strip to try and disable the sports car. That wasn’t immediately effective but did lead to the front driver’s side tire failing later on.

Speeds immediately dropped but not by much. Despite the loss of grip, the driver continued racing past several cars and then exited the highway. Ultimately, he couldn’t keep running. Around a minute after the tire took its leave from the Corvette, the driver hopped a curb and hit a fence. Officers moved in and arrested the driver and his only passenger. Notably, the end of the chase happened in El Monte, California. The driver traveled almost 70 miles (112 km) during the pursuit, according to Fox 11. Seeing as the driver is only 15 years old, authorities won’t release personal information about him. Though the passenger, who is 19, was also arrested, no details are publicly available about them at this time. All that is clear now is that these two kids made some poor decisions and will likely be affected for a long time to come.  Image Credit: Fox 11",
