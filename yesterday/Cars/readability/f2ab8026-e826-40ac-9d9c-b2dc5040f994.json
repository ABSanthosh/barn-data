  "description": "Citroen is seriously evaluating bringing the e-Spacetourer to India to enter the fast-growing premium MPV space here. If it materializes, it will be brought to India as a full import, but given the ongoing FTA talks, Citroen could have the opportunity to price it attractively. This MPV is available with diesel and electric powertrains abroad, but it is only the EV version that’s being evaluated for India. e-Spacetourer gets a 75kWh battery with up to 348km range Available in two trims with two wheelbase options abroad Could be positioned between BYD eMax 7 and MG M9 Citroen e-Spacetourer: what is it? Measuring over 5meters in length in its long wheelbase guise, the e-Spacetourer is a typical upright and boxy MPV in similar vein to the upcoming MG M9. It packs in a 75kWh battery that powers a single electric motor producing 136hp. Citroen claims a range of 348km in a single charge on the WLTP cycle. The e-Spacetourer also gets a short wheelbase version with a smaller 49kWh and a claimed range of up to 320km, but it is likely that the long wheelbase variant with the larger battery will be brought to India. The biggest USP of the such a body style is, of course, the second and third-row space. On that front, the e-Spacetourer has an incredibly spacious cabin with captain chairs for the third row that are just as comfortable as the middle-row. The middle-row even gets a swiveling function in certain configurations with fold-out tray tables.  Case for the Citroen e-Spacetourer in India The luxury MPV space has steadily been growing over the last few years. Just last year alone, Toyota sold as many as 1,155 units of the Vellfire in India, and its sibling, the Lexus LM, is also very popular among the wealthy. Mind you, these are MPVs priced well above Rs 1 crore (ex-showroom). Meanwhile, at the lower end of the spectrum, the Kia Carnival has sold 967 units in between January to May this year. And with MG joining the ranks soon with the M9, this segment is only going to grow further. So, while it is a niche, there certainly is a business case here. Citroen e-Spacetourer: positioning in the market The e-Spacetourer, however, isn’t as luxuriously appointed as a Kia Carnival or the MG M9. It’s cabin is functional, yet gets the basics right with plush seats and adequate creature comforts, which means Citroen could price it attractively against the similarly sized Carnival and M9. More importantly, it is likely to be brough to India from the UK, and given India’s ongoing FTA talks, Citroen might just be able to get the pricing right. Upon launch, it could fit in the space between the BYD eMax 7 and the Kia Carnival.  Also See: Mahindra BE 6, XEV 9e Pack Two variants add bigger 79kWh battery Renault Duster EV confirmed by sister brand Dacia's CEO",
