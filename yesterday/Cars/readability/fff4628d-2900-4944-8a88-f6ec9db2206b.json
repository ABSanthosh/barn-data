Very few, but that’s the story behind this well-worn 1955 BSA Gold Star. The bike’s current owner used to spot it on the road frequently growing up, intrigued and often wondered who the rider on board was. Many years later he discovered Reinhard Neumair’s workshop on the outskirts of Munich, Germany; imagine his surprise when he saw the fully-faired Gold Star parked there. If you’ve never heard of Reinhard Neumair, it’s probably because he keeps a very low profile. Now in his late sixties, he spends his winters making magic in his workshop, and his summers following the classic racing circuit all over Europe, with his wife in their van. There’s very little that he doesn’t know about, or can’t do with vintage British motorcycles. Reinhard first acquired the BSA Gold Star in 1985, by which time it was already classified as a classic. He rode it for about two years before turning it into a fully fledged track bike—and then raced the snot out of it until the late 90s. The heavily patina’d BSA has been through countless iterations over the years. Reinhard rebuilt the 350 cc engine to 500 cc early on, using a handmade one-piece crankshaft with custom bearings, a bespoke camshaft, and a Carrillo conrod. Other highlights include BMW valves, Jawa tappets, and a five-speed racing transmission. A couple of years into its tenure as a race bike, the Gold Star was treated to a set of Ceriani forks. The drum brake hubs have changed a handful of times over the years. Reinhard initially replaced the stock front hub with a Ceriani part, before swapping it for a Fontana hub that stayed put for the longest. A Yamaha TZ item went on next, but the bike now uses the front and back hubs from a BSA A65. The bike’s frame hasn’t been messed with too much over the years, but the swingarm is bespoke. The seat and tank are custom too, while the oil tank comes from a BSA Gold Star Cross. Other details include NJB shocks, and a Smiths tacho that sits on a custom mount. Reinhard enjoyed several memorable adventures aboard his BSA, before retiring it from race duty. He raced it at iconic tracks like Hockenheim and Monza, finished in the top 10 in Daytona in 1990 and 1991, and competed in the Manx Grand Prix on the Isle of Man in 1992, 93, and 95. He also competed in the Czech racing championship. Keen eyes will notice a few additions to the Gold Star that aren’t needed for racing—like lights and a license plate holder. That’s because the new owner requested that Reinhard make the bike street legal, but still retain its beat-up race special vibe. The only thing Reinhard didn’t add to the bike, was a starter button. “There is no kick-starter either, so it has to be pushed, just like in the old days,” says photographer Rodrigo Stix, who’s been working with Reinhard under the banner of Team Top Gear for the past four years. “But once it runs,” he adds, “you’ll have loads of fun and feelings on that 500 single.” Team Top Gear Instagram | Images by, and with thanks to, Rodrigo Stix",
