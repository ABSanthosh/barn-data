  "description": "This 1985 Porsche 928S was purchased by the current owner from the first owner in November 2000 and has since been driven sparingly, accumulating 8k of the 93k miles shown. In preparation for the sale the timing belt, rollers, water pump, and a fuel pump were replaced. The car is finished in Silver Metallic over black leather and is powered by a 5.0-liter V8 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes 16\" seven-hole alloy wheels, a sunroof, a rear spoiler, pop-up headlights, heated power-adjustable front bucket seats, Blaupunkt cassette stereo, and cruise control. This 928S is now offered in North Carolina on dealer consignment with the owner's manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Virginia title.",

In preparation for the sale the timing belt, rollers, water pump, and a fuel pump were replaced. The car is finished in Silver Metallic over black leather and is powered by a 5.0-liter V8 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes 16″ seven-hole alloy wheels, a sunroof, a rear spoiler, pop-up headlights, heated power-adjustable front bucket seats, Blaupunkt cassette stereo, and cruise control. This 928S is now offered in North Carolina on dealer consignment with the owner’s manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Virginia title. The car is finished in Silver Metallic (936) and shows signs of having received paintwork, according to the selling dealer. Features a sunroof, a rear window wiper, front and rear spoilers, fog lights, and pop-up headlights with washers. The paint shows signs of wear on the front bumper cover and lower-left fender, and there is an indentation on the passenger door. Detailed photos of the exterior are provided in the gallery. The 16″ seven-hole alloy wheels are mounted with Hankook Ventus V2 Concept 2 tires that were installed in July 2024. Braking is handled by discs at each corner. The heated power-adjustable front bucket and folding rear seats are trimmed in black leather, and interior appointments include a Blaupunkt cassette stereo, cruise control, and a digital clock. The shift boot is loose and the air conditioning does not blow cold. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 170-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline as well as auxiliary gauges for coolant temperature, fuel level, oil pressure, and voltage. The fuel gauge will intermittently show erratic readings. The six-digit odometer shows 93k miles, approximately 8k of which were added under current ownership. The 5.0-liter V8 was factory rated at 288 horsepower and 302 lb-ft of torque. The fuel injection system was cleaned and the fuel pump, battery, coolant, and engine oil were replaced. The timing belt, tensioner roller, idler roller, and the water pump were replaced in October 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a rear-mounted five-speed manual transaxle. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage. It lists an initial entry in July 1991 and shows multiple gaps between entries. You are not connected to real-time updates.
