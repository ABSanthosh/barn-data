  "text": "A teaser of the third model suggests it could offer even more ground clearance than the Terra and Traveler 3 hours ago by Brad Anderson Before it thinks about a third model, Scout first has to ensure the Traveler and Terra are a success. The original International Harvester Scout was sold as a two-door convertible. The head of product marketing at Scout indicated there may be interested in a smaller model. Production of the Scout Traveler and Terra isn’t set to kick off until 2027, but the VW Group is already casting an eye toward what might launch next. According to some reports, a two-door off-roader is on the table, aimed squarely at the likes of the Jeep Wrangler and Ford Bronco. A tempting proposition? Or would Scout be better off carving its own path rather than trying to muscle into a market already dominated by some heavy-hitters? At the unveiling of the two production-intent concepts in Nashville, Scout showed attendees a slideshow about its future plans. On one of these slides included side profile shots of the Traveler and Terra, as well as a mystery third model. Most of this model was covered in a bright orange cover, but some details are still visible. Read: These Are 7 Details About The Scout Traveler and Terra You May Have Missed It appears as though this model sits on slightly larger wheels and tires than the Traveler and Terra. It also has an even shorter front overhang than the brand’s first two models and looks to offer slightly more ground clearance. The Autopian, which shared the slide, suggests that this third model may also be shorter than the Traveler SUV, perhaps indicating that it could be a two-door with a convertible roof. A model like this with the Scout badge wouldn’t be without historical precedent. The original Scout built by International Harvester had two doors, and several models were offered with removable roofs, including a retractable soft-top known as the ‘Sportop.’ If Scout is aiming to evoke nostalgia with a modern twist, a two-door convertible could be just the ticket. When asked about Scout’s decision to launch the two models with a hardtop and an optional ‘Cabana’ style roof, Shaheen Karimian, the head of product marketing, hinted that there might be a niche audience craving a fully open-top experience in a more compact package. Karimian suggested that while the current lineup caters to practicality, there’s a potential market—albeit a small one—that would appreciate a true open-air option. “How can we provide an open air feeling with the maximum amount of benefit, with the least amount of compromise? We landed at the cabana roof and glass roof options,” he told The Autopian. “On a two-row vehicle of this size, to deliver on all the other customer needs, the removable panels would be large, heavy, and challenging to provide a high quality experience without creating a higher customer price or an impacted vehicle experience.” “It is true a smaller subset of customers are saying they want that removable roof experience… Doesn’t mean we can’t do one in the future, on say a vehicle with fewer doors and a shorter wheelbase,” Karimian added. Of course, the future of a third model from the Scout brand will rest on the popularity of the Traveler and Terra. Scout also needs to get these two models into production and into the hands of customers before it can get too ahead of itself and start investing heavily in future products.
