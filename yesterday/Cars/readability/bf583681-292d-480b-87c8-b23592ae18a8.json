  "description": "This 1969 Jaguar XKE Series II roadster was purchased out of Pennsylvania by the seller in 1984. A refurbishment begun in 2015 and conducted by Classic AutoSmith of Marietta, Georgia, involved stripping the car and refinishing it in gray, retrimming the red leather interior, rebuilding the 4.2-liter inline-six, and replacing the front frame triangle and the 15\" wire wheels. Equipment includes a four-speed manual transmission, a limited-slip differential, a black soft top, LED headlights, four-wheel disc brakes, and a wood-rimmed steering wheel. This XKE roadster is now offered with service records, a workshop manual, a car cover, and Georgia registration in the seller's name.",

A refurbishment begun in 2015 and conducted by Classic AutoSmith of Marietta, Georgia, involved stripping the car and refinishing it in gray, retrimming the red leather interior, rebuilding the 4.2-liter inline-six, and replacing the front frame triangle and the 15″ wire wheels. Equipment includes a four-speed manual transmission, a limited-slip differential, a black soft top, LED headlights, four-wheel disc brakes, and a wood-rimmed steering wheel. This XKE roadster is now offered with service records, a workshop manual, a car cover, and Georgia registration in the seller’s name. The car was stripped and repainted in 2018 in Warwick Gray and the chrome parts were redone, the seller tells us. The black soft top has been replaced, and other exterior equipment includes open headlights with LED bulbs as well as a louvered clamshell hood, triple windshield wipers, a driver-side mirror, wraparound chrome bumpers, bright trim, and dual exhaust outlets. A ding on the driver-side rocker panel is pictured up close in the gallery below. Chrome-finished 15″ wire wheels are secured by two-eared knock-offs and are mounted with BFGoodrich Advantage T/A tires. The wheels and tires were replaced during the aforementioned refurbishment, as were the front frame triangle, shocks, brake lines, and brake calipers. The interior has been refurbished and features bucket seats upholstered in red leather along with a color-coordinated center console, door panels, and carpeting. Holes for a previously installed radio and speakers are evident in the center stack. The wood-rimmed steering wheel fronts Smiths instrumentation including a 160-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 5k-rpm redline as well as an analog clock and gauges for voltage, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 71k miles, approximately 3k of which were added under current ownership. The steering wheel was replaced and the tachometer repaired during the refurbishment. The 4.2-liter inline-six was factory equipped with dual Zenith-Stromberg carburetors and rated at 246 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque when new. The engine block was decked, the cooling jackets were cleaned, the alternator was rebuilt, and the pistons, sleeves, radiator, and flywheel were replaced around 2015, according to records viewable in the gallery. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The vehicle is being sold on its Georgia registration, which serves as the ownership document in Georgia. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
