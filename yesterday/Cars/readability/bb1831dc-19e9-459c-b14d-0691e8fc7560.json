  "text": "Taking inspiration from BMW's Vision Driving Experience, Sugar Design has imagined what a future i3 wagon could look like 2 hours ago by Brad Anderson The independent study features similar styling details to BMW‘s Vision Driving Experience prototype. The first Neue Klasse model, the iX3 SUV, is set to launch later this year with the i3 sedan to follow. BMW’s 800-volt architecture promises to charge its next gen EVs 30% faster than current systems. Fresh off BMW’s unveiling of its 3 Series-sized Vision Driving Experience testbed, the prototype’s striking exterior design has inspired an updated concept for a potential Neue Klasse wagon—or, as BMW likes to call it, a Touring model. Brought to life by Sugar Design, this concept offers a glimpse of what an electric i3 Touring could look like, though there’s no guarantee it will ever make it to production. Still, we’re keeping our fingers crossed it does. A Refined Take on the Original Vision The overall shape and design of the sexy estate is similar to the original Neue Klasse concept that the same artist imagined back in late 2023. However, the revised version incorporates some thoughtful refinements, like the addition of intricate LED headlights and taillights that are clearly inspired by BMW’s latest prototype. Read: BMW Vision Vehicle Is Our Best Look Yet At The iM3 Neue Klasse The most obvious change is the front. While BMW’s Vision Driving Experience prototype looks similar to the original Vision Neue KIasse concept, the kidney-shaped grilles and lights are now much smaller, making for a sleeker and more attractive front-end design. Naturally, they won’t be to everyone’s tastes, but we think they look nice and a welcome departure from some of the questionable headlight designs of many current BMW models. Illustrations SugarDesign It’s not just the front end of this Neue Klasse Touring that looks the goods. It’s also been imagined with rear-facing cameras in the place of traditional wing mirrors and has no visible door handles, adding to the sleek looks. The LED taillights also have similar signatures to the Vision Driving Experience car and look particularly nice thanks to the heavy tinting of them. BMW is embarking on an exciting new feature with its Neue Klasse series. The first model in this new family will be the second-generation iX3 set to arrive later this year and is set to be followed by an electric 3-Series, likely adopting the i3 badge. Also launching as part of the Neue Klasse family will be the all-electric M3 that’ll likely adopt many of the same technologies as BMW’s new prototype. Do note that in addition to the i3, the Germans are also working a Cutting-Edge Technology and Future Plans Illustrations SugarDesign The Bavarian brand is also bringing some serious tech to the Neue Klasse family. The new lineup will feature an 800-volt architecture, a first for the automaker, which promises to significantly improve charging times. With the ability to charge up to 30% faster than current systems, BMW’s Neue Klasse EVs could fill up its batteries from 10 to 80% in just 20 minutes. Range is also a major focus, with estimates suggesting these cars could offer up to 500 miles (805 km) on a single charge. If these figures hold up, it will mark a dramatic shift in BMW’s electric vehicle offerings, giving the Neue Klasse a serious edge over the competition in terms of both convenience and performance.
