  "text": "The crossover sports a turbocharged engine and a significantly lower price tag January 2, 2025 at 19:44 by Michael Gauthier Alfa Romeo has quietly introduced an entry-level Tonale. It starts at $36,535 which makes it $9,500 cheaper than the plug-in hybrid variant. Power is provided by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 268 hp and 295 lb-ft. The Alfa Romeo Tonale has been an expensive afterthought and sales have reflected that unfortunate reality. Through the first nine months of 2024, the company only managed to sell 2,737 units in the United States. That’s slightly more than the aging Stelvio, but far from good. However, there’s hope on the horizon as the company has quietly introduced a new entry-level variant. It starts at $36,535 which makes it $9,500 cheaper than the plug-in hybrid variant. The model also undercuts the BMW X1, Cadillac XT4, and Mercedes GLA. 2025 Alfa Romeo Tonale Review: For $60K, Our Tributo Italiano Is Looking For Love In All The Wrong Places That’s a welcome change and there’s also some distance between the Tonale and Dodge Hornet. The latter model starts at $31,585 and has a lot in common with its premium counterpart. Equipment appears to largely carryover and buyers will find LED lighting units, rain-sensing wipers, and unique 18-inch wheels. Moving inside, there’s heated cloth front seats, a heated steering wheel, and black trim instead of the usual aluminum.  The model also comes equipped with a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and a 10.25-inch infotainment system. Rounding out the highlights are dual-zone automatic climate control, a wireless smartphone charger, and a six-speaker audio system. They’re joined by a host of driver assistance systems including adaptive cruise control, blind-spot assist, lane keep assist, rear cross path detection, and full-speed forward collision warning. Customers can also get a package that adds active driving assist and a surround view camera. A turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine resides under the hood, where it produces 268 hp (200 kW / 272 PS) and 295 lb-ft (400 Nm) of torque. It’s connected to a nine-speed automatic transmission and a standard all-wheel drive system. This enables the crossover to accelerate from 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in approximately 6.5 seconds before hitting a top speed of 140 mph (225 km/h). Customers can also expect to return 21 mpg city, 29 mpg highway, and 24 mpg combined. Note: Alfa Romeo prices exclude a $1,995 destination fee and H/T to Autoevolution",
