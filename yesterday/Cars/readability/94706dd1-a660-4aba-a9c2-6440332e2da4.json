  "text": "The 2025 Dodge Durango Hellcat Brass Monkey arrives, but is it enough to excite buyers? We examine this latest Durango and ponder the future of Dodge's aging SUV.The third-gen Dodge Durango has been in production since 2010, and, never one to leave easy pickings on the table, Stellantis has released several special editions this year – presumably, to send the model off and introduce a replacement for the three-row SUV next year. The 2025 Durango SRT Hellcat Brass Monkey is the latest iteration, but is there anything “special” here? It also begs the question: when will Stellantis release something, you know, new, that anybody cares about?Dodge Durango Hellcat Brass Monkey2025 Dodge Durango Hellcat Brass Monkey gets a familiar supercharged V8, hits 60 mph in 3.5 secondsLike all other Hellcat Durango models, the Brass Monkey features all-wheel drive that allows it to launch violently and immediately. It rips off a quarter-mile dash in 11.5 seconds and will eventually achieve a top speed of 180 mph. You probably need no introduction to the supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V8 thrumming underneath the hood. It bolts up to an 8HP95 TorqueFlite eight-speed auto gearbox, developing 710 horsepower and a sound that is, well, quite delightful. Hellcat engine - 6.2 liters of supercharged Hemi glory.So, maybe not a whole lot of new ground being covered in the powertrain department. Surely, Dodge has a cache of exclusive aesthetic appointments in reserve for this limited-edition super SUV? Not really. The Durango Hellcat Brass Monkey gets bronze-painted wheels, a black hood, and Brembo brakes shared with the lesser SRT 392 models. They all come in a dark shade of red that Dodge calls Red Oxide. Inside you’ll find sepia/silver stitching –and Sepia Laguna leather chairs, a configuration that is technically unique to the Monkey.The Charger and Challenger Hellcat models left production in 2023, leaving us with the Durango and Ram TRXIf you thought Hellcat production was over, you aren’t alone and you’re kind of half-right. Dodge has been winding down Hellcat-powered variants since 2023. The automaker made vague claims about emissions standards and government fines, then promptly began shipping models with names like “Last Call” and “Final Edition,” usually with a steep price premium. For example, the 2024 Ram 1500 TRX Final Edition started at over $115,000, compared to the bare-bones truck that started at a hair under $100K.We know it – at least partially - comes down to milking the cash cow, and Dodge will probably sell every one of these Durangos. It’s tough to argue the financial sense, especially when a company is in as dire straits as Stellantis seems to be. But between the Brass Monkey and the Hellcat Hammerhead announced last month, it’s starting to feel like Stellantis is most focused on cultivating a zoo of Hellcat variants, when they should be looking to the future. A Durango replacement is allegedly in the works and should be arriving sometime in 2025 with the new ChargerWhile rumors swirl online regarding the existence of a Durango replacement, we’ve heard little from any official channels. Supposedly, the three-row SUV will borrow the Stealth nameplate and be based on the current Jeep Grand Cherokee. It’s likely we’ll see the new Hurricane engine under the hood – a twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. With no communication one way or the other from Dodge, however, it’s hard to confirm anything in the automaker’s future aside from the Hemi-less Charger debuting sometime in early 2025. Even with that model, there’s little in the way of concrete details. The car will definitely offer electric- and Hurricane-powered variants, and come in two- or four-door variants. Dodge Durango Hellcat Brass MonkeyFinal thoughtsWith well-publicized sales shortcomings, a lineup full of either fumbling or sunsetting vehicles, and numerous production pauses, layoffs, and even facility closures, Stellantis is in trouble. I love a supercharged V8 as much as the next enthusiast, but eventually, we – and, more grimly, Dodge - have to move on. The new Charger’s reception has, so far, been fairly lukewarm. But that could change when people start getting seat time. Here’s hoping the relative silence on the Durango’s replacement isn’t a bad sign, and that the brand can get a foothold in the market with something – before it’s too late.",

It’s likely we’ll see the new Hurricane engine under the hood – a twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cphoenix-super-link href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/news/2025-dodge-durango-srt-hellcat-hammerhead-special-edition-reveal\" onclick=\"return window.phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);\" phx-track-id=\"Embed Card Click\"\u003e\u003c/phoenix-super-link\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith no communication one way or the other from Dodge, however, it’s hard to confirm anything in the automaker’s future aside from the Hemi-less Charger debuting sometime in early 2025. Even with that model, there’s little in the way of concrete details. The car will definitely offer electric- and Hurricane-powered variants, and come in two- or four-door variants. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"\u003e\u003cphoenix-picture\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource type=\"image/webp\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1240px) 700px, (min-width: 675px) 620px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_380/MjEwMDk5MjAzODk5NDAxNTk0/2025-dodge-durango-srt-hellcat-brass-monkey-seatstitching.webp 380w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MjEwMDk5MjAzODk5NDAxNTk0/2025-dodge-durango-srt-hellcat-brass-monkey-seatstitching.webp 620w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MjEwMDk5MjAzODk5NDAxNTk0/2025-dodge-durango-srt-hellcat-brass-monkey-seatstitching.webp 700w\"/\u003e\u003csource sizes=\"(min-width: 1240px) 700px, (min-width: 675px) 620px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_380/MjEwMDk5MjAzODk5NDAxNTk0/2025-dodge-durango-srt-hellcat-brass-monkey-seatstitching.jpg 380w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MjEwMDk5MjAzODk5NDAxNTk0/2025-dodge-durango-srt-hellcat-brass-monkey-seatstitching.jpg 620w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MjEwMDk5MjAzODk5NDAxNTk0/2025-dodge-durango-srt-hellcat-brass-monkey-seatstitching.jpg 700w\"/\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Dodge Durango Hellcat Brass Monkey\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.autoblog.com/.image/t_share/MjEwMDk5MjAzODk5NDAxNTk0/2025-dodge-durango-srt-hellcat-brass-monkey-seatstitching.jpg\" data-src=\"https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MjEwMDk5MjAzODk5NDAxNTk0/2025-dodge-durango-srt-hellcat-brass-monkey-seatstitching.jpg\" height=\"2227\" width=\"3000\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" itemprop=\"contentUrl url\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/phoenix-picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp itemprop=\"caption\"\u003eDodge Durango Hellcat Brass Monkey\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"final-thoughts\"\u003eFinal thoughts\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith well-publicized sales shortcomings, a lineup full of either fumbling or sunsetting vehicles, and numerous production pauses, layoffs, and even facility closures, Stellantis is in trouble. I love a supercharged V8 as much as the next enthusiast, but eventually, we – and, more grimly, Dodge - have to move on. The new Charger’s reception has, so far, been fairly lukewarm. But that could change when people start getting seat time. Here’s hoping the relative silence on the Durango’s replacement isn’t a bad sign, and that the brand can get a foothold in the market with \u003cem\u003esomething\u003c/em\u003e – before it’s too late.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cphoenix-super-link href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/features/2024-dodge-charger-daytona-gets-its-first-walkarounds\" onclick=\"return window.phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);\" phx-track-id=\"Embed Card Click\"\u003e\u003c/phoenix-super-link\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
