It is powered by a 3.6-liter flat-six linked with a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential, and it has been refinished in silver with orange graphics. The car has black leather and Alcantara upholstery, 19″ orange-finished alloy wheels, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, an adjustable rear wing, orange interior trim, a CD stereo, and automatic climate control. This 997.1 GT3 RS was acquired by the selling dealer in 2019 and is now offered with DME reports, a Carfax report, and a branded Pennsylvania title. The track-focused RS model features a carbon-fiber rear wing and wider quarter panels when compared to the standard 997 GT3. This example was fitted with a replacement hood and refinished the current shade of silver, and photos of the repainting process are provided in the gallery. Exterior details include orange graphics, fog lights, LED taillights, and dual center-mounted exhaust outlets. The rear spoiler has received vinyl wrap. Fire damage is listed in a July 2019 entry of the Carfax report, which also states rebuilt titles were issued in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2024. The 19″ orange-finished alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin tires showing 2012 date codes. Braking is handled by Porsche-branded six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors. The GT3 RS was factory equipped with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) featuring adjustable coilovers. The cabin features power-adjustable seats upholstered in black leather and Alcantara, while orange trim accents the interior. Additional appointments include a CD stereo, automatic climate control, and Porsche-branded floor mats. The carpets were replaced and burn damage on interior trim components has been repaired, per the seller. The steering wheel frames a central GT3-branded tachometer with an 8,400-rpm redline, a 225-mph speedometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 11k miles, approximately 2k of which were added under current ownership. The 3.6-liter Mezger flat-six features VarioCam variable valve timing as well as titanium connecting rods and dry-sump lubrication. Factory rated output was 415 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Results of multiple DME reports are provided in the gallery. Photos showing the car undergoing repairs are shown in the photo gallery below. The Carfax report shows the aforementioned damage and states rebuilt titles were issued in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2024. The current Pennsylvania title is a duplicate and carries a “reconstructed” brand. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
