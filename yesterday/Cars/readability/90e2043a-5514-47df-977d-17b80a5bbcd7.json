  "description": "The Bajaj Pulsar NS160 has been updated for 2025 with ABS modes. Although the brand has not officially launched the model, it has already arrived at its dealerships. The updated Bajaj Pulsar NS160 has not been launched officially It features a new mode button to cycle between three ABS modes Bajaj Pulsar NS160: What’s new? It gets three ABS modes to cycle between. The ABS modes were earlier added to the updated RS200. Now, Bajaj has plucked this feature straight out of the RS200 and updated the NS160 with it. The ABS has three modes (Rain, Road, and Off-Road), and it alters the anti-lock braking system’s intervention depending on the mode. There is now a new Mode button to toggle through the different ABS modes.  In terms of design, this update has not brought along any aesthetic changes, and the Pulsar NS160 remains similarly styled as its elder sibling, the NS200. Although both motorcycles received a design and hardware update back in 2023, the updates were modest. The revisions included an upside-down front fork, a bigger 300mm front rotor, a gear position indicator and distance to empty. All these changes were common between the NS160 and NS200.  Powering the Bajaj Pulsar NS160 is an oil-cooled, single-cylinder, 160.3cc engine that comes mated to a 5-speed gearbox. This motor produces 17.2hp and 14.6Nm. While the updated NS160 has already made its way to dealerships, Bajaj hasn’t officially launched this update or announced any prices thus far. It remains to be seen if the brand gives the NS160 a slight price hike or keeps the price unchanged when it finally launches it.  Image source: Power Engine world (YouTube) Also see: Bajaj Pulsar NS 200, NS 160 review: Keeping it fresh",
