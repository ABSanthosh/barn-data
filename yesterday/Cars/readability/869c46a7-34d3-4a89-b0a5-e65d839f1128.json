  "description": "This 1967 Maserati Ghibli is one of 1,170 coupes manufactured during six years of production and was produced in July 1967 before delivery to Rolma Automobili S.r.l. in Milan, Italy. Chassis 042 is said to have been purchased in the early 1970s by an owner whose family retained it for several decades. The car was later purchased in 2018 by its current owner, who moved it from the US to Belgium and kept it in storage for seven years before a recommissioning was performed. Finished in silver over red, the car is powered by a 4.7-liter quad-cam V8 that breathes through four Weber carburetors and is mated to a five-speed manual transmission. Additional features include servo-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, independent front suspension, center-lock 15” Campagnolo wheels, air conditioning, power windows, and a Blaupunkt radio. This Tipo AM115 is now offered as a running project on dealer consignment in Roeselare, Belgium, with Maserati Classiche documents, copies of its factory build sheet and shipping notice, a tool kit, and Belgian registration that lists a 1969 date of first registration.",

Chassis 042 is said to have been purchased in the early 1970s by an owner whose family retained it for several decades.

Additional features include servo-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, independent front suspension, center-lock 15” Campagnolo wheels, air conditioning, power windows, and a Blaupunkt radio. This Tipo AM115 is now offered as a running project on dealer consignment in Roeselare, Belgium, with Maserati Classiche documents, copies of its factory build sheet and shipping notice, a tool kit, and Belgian registration that lists a 1969 date of first registration. The Ghibli was introduced at the 1966 Turin Motor Show with steel bodywork styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro during his time with Carrozzeria Ghia. Design elements evolved through the beginning stages of the model’s production, and early details expressed on this example include a wrap-down trunk, square-edge headlight covers, Altissimo convex taillight lenses, and the absence of bumper overriders. This example is finished in silver, matching the original shade of Argento Auteuil listed on its build and shipping documents. Corrosion is exhibited on the lower edge of several panels and on the undersides of the doors. The selling dealer notes that overspray is visible in various areas. Campagnolo alloy wheels are said to have been repainted under previous ownership and are secured by octagonal knock-offs. Yokohama Avid Touring-S tires measuring 215/70R15 are mounted at each corner, as well as on a matching spare housed in the trunk. Stopping is handled by disc brakes with dual vacuum boosters. The cabin is trimmed in red leather as specified on the factory documents, and areas of the upholstery exhibit damage and discoloration. Features include color-keyed carpeting and lap belts, a beige headliner, air conditioning, power windows, and a Blaupunkt push-button radio. The EFFPI wood-rimmed steering wheel features drilled spokes and a small horn button and sits ahead of Smiths instrumentation including a 180-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 5,500-rpm redline, and gauges monitoring oil pressure and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 24k miles, approximately 100 of which have been added under current ownership. A clock and gauges monitoring amperage, coolant temperature, and oil temperature are situated to the driver’s right above toggle-style switchgear. The 4.7-liter Tipo AM115 V8 features an aluminum block and cylinder heads, dual overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank, and dry-sump lubrication. A recommissioning in preparation for the sale is said to have included tuning of the quadruple Weber carburetors, fluid changes, a fuel system inspection, safety checks, and replacement of the spark plugs and battery. Results of a compression test performed at that time can be viewed in the video gallery below. The selling dealer notes that the car would benefit from further inspection before continued use. Chassis number AM115*042* is shown stamped on the engine block above. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a ZF five-speed manual transmission, which is noted to feel and sound abnormal when downshifting from fifth to fourth and fourth to third gears. The suspension features a coil-sprung double-wishbone front setup with a leaf-sprung solid rear axle. Corrosion is present on areas of the underside. The factory build sheet lists the original components and equipment, as does the factory shipping notice shown in the photo gallery below. Also shown in the gallery are the Maserati Classiche Certificate of Origin, Technical and Aesthetic Characteristics sheet, and Historical Information sheet. The vehicle is being sold on its Belgian registration, which serves as an ownership document in Belgium. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
