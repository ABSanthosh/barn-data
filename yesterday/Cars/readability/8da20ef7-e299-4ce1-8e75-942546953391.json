  "text": "A luxury SUV meets full-size truck in a digital transformation that blurs the line between opulence and utility 2 hours ago by Thanos Pappas The Century SUV has been converted into a full-size truck in the digital world. The renderings created by independent artist Theottle are based on the Tundra. Toyota has shown interest in one-off builds, so a Century truck remains possible. Even in a market saturated with luxury SUVs, there’s something inherently fascinating about imagining one turned into a truck, especially when that SUV happens to be Japan’s most opulent ride. The Century SUV, Toyota’s flagship luxury model, is often considered the Japanese answer to the Rolls-Royce Cullinan. It’s built for comfort, silence, and understated extravagance. Toyota even went as far as creating a one-off convertible version, which begs the question: what other forms could the Century take on? More: You’ll Swear This Is A Real Tundra Until You Look Closer Digital artist Theophilus Chin (aka Theottle) has an idea. His latest renderings imagine the Century as a full-size pickup, borrowing cues from the brand’s heavy-hitter truck, the Tundra. The result? Something that looks like it just dropped its kids off at a private academy before heading to a mountain retreat. The renderings are grounded in reality, using the Tundra as a base. For reference, the Tundra measures between 233.6 and 252.5 inches long (5,933–6,414 mm), depending on the body style. The standard Century SUV sits at a more modest 204.9 inches (5,205 mm). But a truck variant would likely stretch those numbers, with a longer wheelbase and a chunkier rear overhang to accommodate the bed. Theottle kept the front end of the SUV intact, with the imposing grille and the characteristic bi-tone treatment for the bumper and wheel arches. However, the profile has been tweaked, making room for a spacious “Crew Max” cabin and a standard 5.5-foot rear bed. Illustrations: Theottle The greenhouse features thick chrome accents, matching the discreet roof rails and adding a bit of luxury into the mix. At the back, the imaginary Century truck retains the taillights of the SUV, a portion of which opens together with the tailgate. Finally, the truck rides on different wheels with smaller diameter alloys and taller tires. Under the hood, the Century SUV runs a plug-in hybrid setup that delivers a combined 406 horsepower (303 kW / 412 PS). That comes courtesy of a naturally aspirated 3.5-liter V6 paired with electric motors, an e-CVT transmission, and Toyota’s E-Four Advanced all-wheel drive system. More: Toyota Confirms Production Century GRMN SUV It is worth noting that the Century SUV is underpinned by the TNGA-K unibody architecture rather than the TNGA-F ladder-frame chassis found on the Tundra, Sequoia, and Land Cruiser. This makes it less suitable for a full-size truck if you really care about cargo-carrying and towing capabilities, but better in terms of handling and ride quality. Toyota already offers a high level of customization for the Century SUV, including the option for full bespoke builds. So while a production Century truck isn’t on the roadmap, it could technically happen as a special commission. It wouldn’t be cheap, but for the right customer, someone looking for Maybach-level comfort in a body-on-frame illusion, it might just hit the sweet spot between eccentricity and luxury.",
