The car is finished in Rosso Corsa over Nero Connolly leather and is powered by a 4.9-liter flat-12 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, 16″ five-spoke alloy wheels, pop-up headlights, air conditioning, power windows, a Pioneer head unit, and a gated shifter. This Testarossa is now offered by the selling dealer with the owner’s manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title. The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Rosso Corsa and features pop-up headlights, fog lights, an asymmetrical cooling duct beneath the left fog lamp, side intake strakes, black-finished rocker panels, and quad exhaust outlets. A paint bubble near the front badge and a crack in the windshield are shown in detail in the gallery. Silver 16″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with BFGoodrich g-Force tires. Braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated discs. A brake fluid flush was performed in March 2024. Nero Connolly leather covers the seats, door panels, and lower dashboard. Interior amenities include a Pioneer head unit, motorized seat belts, and a gated shifter located on the center console alongside controls for the air conditioning and power windows. The air conditioning system has been converted to utilize R134a refrigerant. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames Veglia instrumentation including a 200-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 6,800-rpm redline, and gauges for oil pressure and coolant temperature. A clock and auxiliary gauges for fuel level and oil temperature are housed in the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 42k miles. The 4.9-liter flat-12 was factory-rated at 380 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque. The AC compressor, receiver drier, ignition control unit, coil packs, and fuse board were replaced in November 2021. The blower motor was serviced, and the battery was replaced in March 2024, and the alternator was replaced in December 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The flywheel sensor was replaced in November 2021, and the clutch assembly was replaced in December 2024. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage.
