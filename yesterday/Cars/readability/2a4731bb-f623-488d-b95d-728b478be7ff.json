  "description": "This 2022 Lamborghini Countach LPI 800-4 is one of a planned 112 examples designated for production, and it is said to have been one of the first two examples delivered to US-based owners by Automobili Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann and vehicle designer Mitja Borkert during a private reception during Monterey Car Week 2022. The car is finished in Bronzo Zante over Marrone Elpis leather, and power comes from a naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 that drives all four wheels with assistance from a 48-volt electric motor and supercapacitor integrated into a seven-speed automated manual transmission. Equipment includes vacuum-assisted carbon-ceramic brakes, pushrod-actuated magnetorheological dampers, electronic stability control, rear-wheel steering, a front-axle lift system, silver-finished staggered-dimension wheels, the gloss carbon-fiber exterior package, an electrochromic roof panel, carbon-fiber interior trim, and a touchscreen infotainment system. This Countach LPI 800-4 was purchased by the selling dealer in 2023, and it is now offered in Irvine, California, with factory literature, tools, a window sticker, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Iowa title.",

The car is finished in Bronzo Zante over Marrone Elpis leather, and power comes from a naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 that drives all four wheels with assistance from a 48-volt electric motor and supercapacitor integrated into a seven-speed automated manual transmission. Equipment includes vacuum-assisted carbon-ceramic brakes, pushrod-actuated magnetorheological dampers, electronic stability control, rear-wheel steering, a front-axle lift system, silver-finished staggered-dimension wheels, the gloss carbon-fiber exterior package, an electrochromic roof panel, carbon-fiber interior trim, and a touchscreen infotainment system. This Countach LPI 800-4 was purchased by the selling dealer in 2023, and it is now offered in Irvine, California, with factory literature, tools, a window sticker, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Iowa title. An homage to Lamborghini’s wedge-shaped supercar of the 1970s and ’80s, the Countach LPI 800-4 was unveiled in August 2021 at The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering with styling by Mitja Borkert evoking that of the LP400 and LP500 Countach models. The LPI 800-4 shares the carbon-fiber monocoque and mild-hybrid mechanical underpinnings of its fellow Aventador derivative, the Sián FKP 37. The planned production run of 112 cars paid tribute to the LP112 project name used for development of the original Countach in the 1970s. This example’s carbon-fiber bodywork is finished in Bronzo Zante complemented by the gloss carbon-fiber trim package, a $105,216 option. Paint protection film was installed in 2022. Additional details include hexagonal wheel arches, scissor doors with NACA ducts that extend into the quarter panels, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, a three-position electronically operated rear spoiler, an electrochromic roof panel, trapezoidal bi-LED headlights, hexagonal taillights, electronically powered and heated side mirrors, and quad exhaust outlets. The selling dealer notes an area of touch-up paint on the left corner of the hood and states that replacement PPF was applied following the work. A majority of the selling dealer’s photos were taken in 2022. Silver-finished wheels incorporate a “phone-dial” motif and measure 9×20” up front and 13×21” at the rear with the Pirelli P Zero tires measuring 255/30 and 355/25, respectively. The car is equipped with magnetorheological adaptive pushrod coilover dampers, a front-axle lift system, electronic stability control, dynamic steering with a variable ratio, and rear-wheel steering. Stopping is handled by vacuum-assisted disc brakes with 400x38mm carbon-ceramic cross-drilled and ventilated rotors acted upon by six-piston aluminum monobloc calipers up front and 380x38mm rotors acted upon by four-piston calipers at the rear. The cabin is trimmed in Marrone Elpis leather that covers the seats, headliner, door panels, lower dashboard, center console, and instrument surround. Color-coordinated carpets line the floors, and carbon-fiber trim accents the dash, doors, and console. Additional features include embroidered headrests, automatic climate control, a touchscreen infotainment system, and a “1 di 112” console badge. The three-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of shift paddles and a configurable digital display. The odometer is said to show 556 miles. The 6.5-liter V12 combines with a 48-volt electric motor that is integrated into a seven-speed ISR automated manual transmission along with a supercapacitor that is charged via regenerative braking. Output was factory rated at 770 horsepower from the engine and 34 horsepower from the motor for a combined rating of over 800 horsepower, which is sent to all four wheels via a Haldex all-wheel-drive system with a limited-slip rear differential. The surface underneath the hood features a Countach profile sketch as well as signatures of Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann and head of design Mitja Borkert. The window sticker presented above shows standard equipment and options as well as a total suggested retail price of $2,757,616. Factory books, tools, and a car cover are included in the sale and can be seen in the gallery. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. The selling dealer states that the Lamborghini Certified Selezione program has extended the factory warranty on the car until August 24, 2026.  You are not connected to real-time updates.
