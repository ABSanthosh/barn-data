It’s a safe choice—modern, efficient, backed by warranty, and a great entry into the BMW lineup. But what if you could spend even less and walk away with one of the fastest, most luxurious sedans BMW has ever built? Recently on Bring a Trailer, a 2018 BMW Alpina B7 xDrive—finished in classic Black Sapphire Metallic over Black Nappa Leather with 33,000 miles—sold for just $44,000. That’s $1000 less than the starting price of a new 330i. And it’s not even a comparison in terms of power, luxury, and prestige.Supercar Performance in a TuxedoALPINA doesn’t tune BMWs—they re-engineer them. The G12 B7 features a 4.4-liter twin-turbocharged V8, specially tuned by ALPINA to produce 600 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. Thanks to xDrive all-wheel drive and launch control, the B7 rockets from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.6 seconds. Its top speed is an astonishing 205 mph, making it one of the fastest sedans in the world when it launched.But the magic of the B7 isn’t just in straight-line speed. ALPINA fits the car with active roll stabilization, rear-wheel steering, and a specially tuned air suspension that can lower the car by 0.8 inches at high speeds. The result is a limo that handles like a much smaller sports sedan, yet glides over the road with quiet, effortless composure.Handcrafted Luxury You Can FeelThe interior is what you’d expect from a $150,000 flagship. Hand-stitched Lavalina leather, ceramic controls, deep-pile carpets, and a Bowers \u0026 Wilkins Diamond surround sound system elevate the cabin experience beyond anything in the 3 Series lineup. Even small details like the ALPINA-specific digital instrument cluster and blue/green stitching set it apart. Rear passengers are treated to massaging, heated, and ventilated seats, rear entertainment screens, and soft-close doors. The panoramic Sky Lounge LED roof adds ambient lighting inspired by a starry night sky—something you definitely won’t find in a 330i.The Reality CheckOf course, there’s a reason why cars like this depreciate so heavily. Maintenance costs on a used ALPINA B7 can be eye-watering. Everything from tires to suspension components to electronic systems is expensive to repair or replace. And without warranty coverage, those costs fall squarely on the owner. But for those willing to budget for ongoing care, the value proposition is unbeatable. For the price of a new entry-level BMW sedan, you get supercar speed, limousine luxury, and exclusivity that no 330i could ever match.The 2025 BMW 330i is a great car for someone wanting a modern, reliable, and efficient sports sedan. But if you’re willing to take the plunge into the world of pre-owned luxury, the ALPINA B7 xDrive G12 offers a level of performance and craftsmanship that’s simply on another level.",
