  "description": "Mahindra has sold over 5 lakh SUVs for the first time in a calendar year. With the company announcing its December 2024 wholesales numbers, annual sales for 2024 add up to 5,28,460 units, which constitutes a robust year-on-year increase of 22 percent (CY2023: 4,33,172 units). Scorpio twins account for 32 percent of total Jan-Nov 2024 despatches  Mahindra Bolero wholesales at 93,850 units at end-November 2024 XUV700, XUV 3XO and Thar range are placed 3rd, 4th and 5th Mahindra model-wise sales in 2024 While the model-wise sales split for the Mahindra SUV portfolio for December 2024 is not yet available, the wholesales numbers for the first 11 months of the year give a good indication of the key growth drivers. The Mahindra Scorpio, available as the Scorpio N and Scorpio Classic, is currently the best-selling model for the company. At 1,54,169 units sold between January and November, the Scorpio twins accounted for 32 percent of Mahindra’s total despatches in the first 11 months of 2024. In No. 2 position is the indefatigable and sturdy workhorse, the Bolero, with 93,850 units. The Bolero is followed by the flagship XUV700 (83,390 units) and the XUV300/XUV 3XO (78,826 units). The fifth bestseller M is the Thar-Thar Roxx combine (69,354 units).  Meanwhile, the all-electric XUV400 has clocked total dispatches of 7,188 units in the first 11 months of FY2024. End-November 2024 saw Mahindra launch two brand-new e-SUVs in the form of the BE 6 and XEV 9E. The company’s EV sales will take off from January when the two zero-emission models, which have drawn a strong customer response, enter select showrooms across the country. Mahindra total sales in 2024 Having crossed 50,000-unit sales in a month for the first time in September 2024, Mahindra followed it up with a best-ever 54,504 units in the festival-laden October (up 25 percent) and has clocked despatches of 46,222 units in November (up 16 percent). December 2024 numbers were a more sedate 41,424 units, up 18 percent YoY, despite it being the last month of the year when typically new vehicle buyers prefer to defer their purchase decisions to the new year. In India’s highly competitive UV market, Mahindra, which has 10 SUVs (Bolero, Bolero Neo, Bolero Neo+, Scorpio, Scorpio N, Scorpio Classic, Thar, Thar Roxx, XUV 3XO, XUV400 and XUV700), is extremely well placed to capitalise on the surging demand for this vehicle type. Compared to CY2023, Mahindra despatched an additional 95,288 SUVs in CY2024 and surpassed the 5 lakh wholesales milestone for the first time in a calendar year (5,28,460 units). Even on the fiscal year front, the company is well set to record its best-ever sales and achieve the 5,00,000 milestone for the first time in a fiscal. With three months left to go for FY2025 to come to a close, Mahindra’s sales of 4,02,360 units in the first nine months of the current fiscal (FY2025) to date are already 87 percent of the SUV maker’s record sales of 4,59,877 units in FY2024. At present, it is just 57,517 units away from that figure and 97,640 units from the 5 lakh milestone.
