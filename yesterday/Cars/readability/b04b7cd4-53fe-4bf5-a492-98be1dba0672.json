  "text": "Published:  December 2nd, 2024 I feel like I am doing double-duty when it comes to speculating about high-profile jobs. My beloved Chicago Bears launched head coach Matt Eberflus after a coaching disaster -- in Detroit, no less -- and now Stellantis needs a new boss. I spent a good chunk of my day on a plane, and while I was cooling my heels at O'Hare I saw one of our friendly competitors suggesting Ralph Gilles for the role. I can see the logic there.By coincidence, I am attending a Stellantis event. I will do my journalistic duty and ask our hosts about the change, but I expect tight lips from the PR team. OK, so Gilles could be a candidate. He's certainly a favorite of car enthusiasts. If not Ralph, who else? You out there in the B and B, go ahead and jump in below. You have a good bead on who the top execs -- and the up-and-comers -- are. So if you have ideas, or have personal experience from working in the industry, go ahead and chime in.Oh, and if you know who should coach the Bears, I am all ears for that, too.You know the drill.

Tim Healey Tim Healey grew up around the auto-parts business and has always had a love for cars — his parents joke his first word was “‘Vette”. Despite this, he wanted to pursue a career in sports writing but he ended up falling semi-accidentally into the automotive-journalism industry, first at Consumer Guide Automotive and later at Web2Carz.com. He also worked as an industry analyst at Mintel Group and freelanced for About.com, CarFax, Vehix.com, High Gear Media, Torque News, FutureCar.com, Cars.com, among others, and of course Vertical Scope sites such as AutoGuide.com, Off-Road.com, and HybridCars.com. He’s an urbanite and as such, doesn’t need a daily driver, but if he had one, it would be compact, sporty, and have a manual transmission. More by Tim Healey Published December 2nd, 2024 7:00 PM Comments Join the conversation I'm not sure. I'm not sure one person can run the company with the very different markets they sell vehicles in. It's a very fractured company. I think they need someone to run Europe and someone to run the US operations and they report to the CEO. The three of them will work together to make a cohesive company similar to VW, Honda, Toyota, Kia, Hyundai with regards to shared products and platforms. But, you also need people that understand home markets (like Jeep in the US). Bernd should replace him.",
