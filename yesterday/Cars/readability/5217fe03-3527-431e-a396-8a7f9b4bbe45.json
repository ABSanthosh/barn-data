Finished in GT Silver Metallic over black leather upholstery, the car has 6k miles and is powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six linked with a seven-speed dual-clutch PDK automatic transaxle and a locking differential. Additional equipment includes a black convertible top, LED headlights with PDLS+, Power Steering Plus, 20″ 718 Sport wheels, heated and ventilated power-adjustable Sport Plus seats, a heated steering wheel, Lane Change Assist, a Bose sound system, and Porsche Communication Management with navigation. This 982 Boxster was listed on BaT in August 2024 and is now offered again with a window sticker, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in GT Silver Metallic and has LED headlights with Porsche Dynamic Light System Plus (PDLS+) as well as a power-operated black soft top, ParkAssist parking sensors, power-folding mirrors, dual exhaust outlets, and a black-finished speed-activated rear spoiler. The 20″ 718 Sport alloy wheels are mounted with staggered-width Pirelli P Zero tires. The car is equipped with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) and Power Steering Plus. GTS 4.0 suspension provides a ride height 20mm lower than the standard model, and stopping power is handled by red-finished Porsche-branded calipers over cross-drilled rotors at each corner. The heated and ventilated power-adjustable Sport Plus seats are trimmed in black leather and are joined by a color-coordinated dashboard, door panels, and carpets. Porsche-branded floor mats line the footwells, and additional appointments include Guards Red seatbelts, a Bose sound system, the Light Design Package, Lane Change Assist, a wind deflector, dual-zone automatic climate control, and Porsche Communication Management with navigation. The heated leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a central tachometer with a 7,800-rpm redline flanked by a 200-mph speedometer and a configurable information display. A Sport Chrono stopwatch is mounted atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 6k miles, all of which were added under current ownership. The 4.0-liter flat-six was factory rated at 394 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque when paired with the automatic transaxle. The oil was changed in May 2024. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch PDK automatic transaxle with Porsche Torque Vectoring and a mechanically locking differential. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Champion Porsche of Pompano Beach, Florida, along with factory colors, options, and a total price of $102,340.
