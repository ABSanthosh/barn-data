  "text": "Apr 6, 2025 6:17 PM EDTWave Goodbye to Hyundai’s Complimentary Maintenance Hyundai has received acclaim for having one of the best complimentary maintenance plans for new vehicle customers—but things are about to change. Starting with 2026 and newer models, Hyundai will no longer offer its free routine maintenance perk with coverage for a driver’s first three years or 36,000 miles, whichever comes first. This maintenance plan included oil and oil filter changes, tire rotations, and a multi-point inspection. Last week, Hyundai sent a bulletin to dealerships saying: “The cost of the program grew to unsupportable levels,” as first reported by CarsDirect. The bulletin continued, “The HCM [Hyundai Complimentary Maintenance] Program has provided coverage for the Hyundai model from 2020 through 2025. As the program has matured, Hyundai has determined a new approach is necessary and will not be offering the HCM Program for model year 2026 and beyond.”  What's the Program's New Version? Hyundai will be selling pre-paid maintenance plans for 2026 and newer models for dealerships to increase profits. However, you can still receive HCM program coverage by purchasing a 2025 model, and previous 2020 through 2025 Hyundai customers will retain the perk. For 2026 models and beyond, Hyundai buyers can select either a “Pre-Paid Basic” or “Pre-Paid Schedule” plan. The Pre-Paid Basic plan covers oil changes and tire rotations, whereas its counterpart fulfills all scheduled maintenance listed in the vehicle’s owner’s manual. The dealership bulletin also notes “normal vs severe usage,” representing how customers use their cars, which could result in a specified, tailor-made plan. Hyundai’s new maintenance plans will be available with coverage lasting up to eight years. The automaker’s soon-to-expire HCM program is separate from its 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty and five-year, 60,000-mile new vehicle warranty, both of which will remain.  While car shoppers can purchase a 2025 Hyundai to receive HCM program coverage, consumers may look toward other manufacturers with competitive new vehicle maintenance programs, like Jaguar, Genesis, BMW, and Mini. Jaguar offers the best complimentary maintenance program of the automakers, covering scheduled maintenance for five years or 60,000 miles, whichever comes first. Genesis, which won’t be impacted by its parent company Hyundai’s decision to drop the HCM program, provides three years or 36,000 miles of routine maintenance coverage, along with BMW and Mini.  Hyundai confirmed the conditions of its new pre-paid maintenance plan strategy in an email to Autoblog, saying, “The Hyundai Complimentary Maintenance Program will end for model year 2026 vehicles and beyond. However, for customers who purchased a vehicle that included Hyundai Complimentary Maintenance (model years 2020-2025), there will be no changes to their service, and it will continue to be available for the model year 2024/2025 vehicles sold or leased as new (non-fleet). We encourage owners with questions about their Hyundai Complimentary Maintenance to visit their local dealership or contact the Hyundai Customer Care Center at (800) 633-5151.” Final thoughts While other automakers are still offering competitive complimentary maintenance coverage, these plans are generally limited to luxury brands, and with vehicle prices set to increase following President Trump’s newly imposed 25% tariff on all car and part imports, high-end models from companies like Jaguar will likely grow further out of reach of drivers’ budgets. Hyundai and Genesis Motor North America Chief Executive Randy Parker told dealers that “tariffs are not easy” and “current vehicle pricing is not guaranteed and may be subject to change for units wholesaled after April 2 [the date in which Trump’s tariffs went into effect],” Carscoops reports.",
