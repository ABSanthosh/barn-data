  "text": "Cowboys roamed the vast American countryside in the late 19th Century, often with nothing more than their horse and a bedroll. There have been countless songs, poems, and paintings romanticizing their exploits; however, it was often lonely and treacherous work. These conditions are not unfamiliar to the modern motorcycle rider. Unlike the cowboys of the past, modern technology arms the savvy traveler with new levels of comfort, but a shelter that is good for one rider may not be the best option for another. While adventure bikes and baggers have more storage space, some motorcycles require more creative solutions. Regardless of what you ride, size and packability are key factors, not to mention an honest assessment of how much you’re willing to rough it on the road. No one solution works for everyone, so here are shelter choices for your next motorcycle trip. Redverz Atacama Expedition Motorcycle Tent If you’re the kind of rider who prefers comfort over minimalism, the Redverz Atacama Expedition Motorcycle Tent is your ideal home on the road. Built for adventure motorcyclists who want space to stretch out, this feature-rich tent sleeps three and has a peak height of 77 inches (yes, you can stand up inside). It also incorporates a drive-in motorcycle garage that handles full-size ADV bikes with panniers. With four doors, ample ventilation, and flow-through air circulation, it’s designed for riders tackling all kinds of climates and conditions. The rectangular floor plan and nearly vertical walls make it feel more like a base camp than a temporary shelter, offering true livability while traveling. Despite its spacious footprint—195″ long by 102″ wide—, the Atacama packs down to just 21″ x 10″ and weighs 14.6 lbs, including poles and pegs. It’s constructed with high-quality materials like a 70D waterproof floor, a 4000 mm coated ripstop rainfly, and aluminum 7001 T6 shock-corded poles built to handle serious wind. The versatile garage space not only shelters your bike but also serves as a dry, secure area for gear maintenance or escaping bad weather. With room for three campers and the ability to use cots, store gear, and maintain comfort, the Redverz Atacama is more than a tent—it’s a mobile garage, gear locker, and living room for long-haul motorcycle adventures. [Redverz] Abel Brown Nomad 4 Motorcycle Tent The Abel Brown Nomad 4 Motorcycle Tent is a smart and minimalist shelter option designed specifically for motorcyclists. Based in Fort Collins, Colorado, Abel Brown has created a unique tent system that ditches traditional poles, utilizing your motorcycle as the primary structural support for your camp setup. This lean-to style design is ideal for riders looking to save space and reduce weight, and Abel Brown also offers optional poles for conventional tent pitching. For its fourth release, Abel Brown tackled the common issue of condensation buildup in single-wall tents by adding a side vestibule and a crown vent that creates a natural stovepipe ventilation effect. This improves airflow while offering a protected space to store boots or wet gear, keeping the tent’s interior clean and dry. Weighing just 3 lbs 5 oz and packing down to 12″ x 6″ x 6″, it’s a compact and purpose-driven shelter that integrates seamlessly into any moto-travel kit. Durable 20D/40D nylon ripstop with double waterproof coatings and reinforced seams means the Nomad 4 is rugged enough for real-world use, while maintaining a small footprint and fast setup for life on the road. [Abel Brown] Big Agnes Fly Creek HV UL Bikepack Solution Dye The Fly Creek HV UL Bikepack Tent from Big Agnes is a standout option for riders who prioritize packability and performance. Originally designed with bicycle touring in mind, the benefits of this tent series translate exceptionally for motorcycle campers. The shortened 12” pole segments make packing a breeze—stashing easily in a saddlebag, strapped to a sissy bar, or even lashed to handlebars when space allows. Available in both one and two-person configurations, the Fly Creek is ideal for solo riders—but unless you’re chasing every ounce of weight savings, the two-person model is highly recommended for the extra space it offers. It weighs just 2 lbs 2 oz on the trail, and packs down to a compact 5.5″ x 6.5″ x 14.” With 28 ft² of floor space, 8 ft² of vestibule storage, and clever gear organization—like daisy chain webbing loops for drying clothes and smart internal stash zones above your feet—it’s a compact home away from home. With 42 inches of headroom, taped seams, and a waterproof fly, it offers excellent weather protection without weighing you down. This is a go-to tent for motorcycle adventurers who want to ride fast, pack light, and sleep well. [Big Agnes] Rab Trailhead Bivy For motorcycle campers looking to keep weight and bulk to an absolute minimum, the Rab Trailhead Bivy is an excellent ultralight shelter option. Weighing just 406 g and packing down to 18 cm x 12 cm, it slips easily into a pannier or backpack, making it ideal for riders with limited storage space. Unlike a traditional tent, the bivy is all about simplicity—there’s no vestibule or room for gear, just a protective shell for your sleep system. That said, its 40D ripstop nylon construction with PU coating, 10,000 mm hydrostatic head, and taped seams offer reliable shelter from wind and rain. This bivy isn’t for the claustrophobic—bivy sacs are minimalist by design, and some models can fully enclose the face. The Trailhead Bivy sidesteps this with a simple snap opening, stiffened peak, and an integrated rain gutter, allowing for better airflow and a reduced ‘zipped-in’ feeling. It’s especially well-suited for solo riders who don’t mind sacrificing amenities for serious weight savings and practicality. [Rab] Cowboy Camping The name ‘cowboy camping’ comes from cattle-driving wranglers who slept under open skies out of sheer necessity. Cowboy camping comes with its fair share of downsides, as rain, dew, wind, and cold all become real threats. Your gear is just as vulnerable, with no vestibule or cover to keep it dry. Bugs and even curious animals can wander into your sleeping area, and without the heat-trapping benefits of a tent or bivy, nights can get chilly fast. It’s the most barebones approach to sleeping outdoors, and it’s not for the faint of heart. But despite all that, cowboy camping holds a timeless allure. There’s something deeply grounding about drifting off next to a campfire, the stars overhead, and nothing but a blanket between you and the earth. For all its risks and discomforts, it’s an experience every rider should try at least once—just you, your bike, and the wide open night. Whether you’re chasing the minimalist thrill under the stars or setting up a mobile basecamp with a full-sized expedition tent, the right shelter can turn any stretch of road into home. Like the cowboys before us, modern motorcycle nomads carve their own trails across vast landscapes—only now, we have the gear to do it with a bit more comfort and a lot more choice. Your shelter doesn’t just protect you from the elements—it shapes your connection to the road, the ride, and the land around you. So choose the setup that fits your style, pack it tight, and keep rolling. Where the road ends, your next story begins.",
