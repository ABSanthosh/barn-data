  "description": "Ford India will stop providing the FordPass connected car suite on its cars and SUVs from January 1. It was introduced in 2020 along with the launch of the brand’s BS6 line-up, such as the Endeavour, EcoSport, Figo, Freestyle, and Aspire compact sedan. The FordPass app to move to a new platform from January 1 The new platform is incompatible with Ford models in India Ford India's re-entry is likely by next year Why is FordPass being discontinued in India? In an exclusive statement shared with Autocar India, Ford India said that the FordPass app is a global product and will be transitioning to a new platform, which will not support the technology that is being offered on Ford vehicles in India. Active users of the FordPass app will be able to use its features until their free subscription ends on December 31, 2024. This change will not affect the vehicle’s functionality. What features did FordPass app offer? Like most other connected car apps, FordPass works on an in-built 4G data connection that was offered for free, depending on the vehicle. Buyers have access to the FordPass app on their phones, which controls various features like starting, stopping, locking, or unlocking the vehicle. Additionally, owners can grant authorisation for the temporary use of their vehicles. The app also has a 'Move' function that provides real-time vehicle information, such as tyre pressure readings, fuel level, and odometer, and allows for remote start/stop and lock/unlock of the vehicle. Owners can also locate the nearest fuel stations, Ford dealers in the vicinity, and access a guide-on-call for roadside assistance from the brand. Ford's India re-entry plans Ford India has been working on re-entering the domestic market sometime next year. As per the latest update, the brand will initially start selling the Endeavour (known as the Everest globally) as a fully imported model, with local assembly slated to begin a little later.
