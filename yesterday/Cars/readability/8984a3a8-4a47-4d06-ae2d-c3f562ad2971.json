  "description": "First things first. The Audi A6 e-tron Sportback you see here is not an all-electric replacement for the ICE A6 we’re all familiar with. In fact, the two models have little in common. You see, under Audi’s new naming system electric vehicles will have odd numbers in the name with ‘e-tron’ as a suffix (eg. Q4 e-tron, Q6 e-tron, Q8 e-tron) while ICE models will run odd numbers. The next-gen A6 will become ‘A7’, ‘A5’ is the name for what is the latest-gen A4 and so on.    This A6 e-tron is the second Audi model after the Q6 e-tron to be built on PPE or premium platform electric co-developed with Porsche. Advancements on the motors, battery and architecture promise enhanced efficiency, faster charging and superior performance. The A6 e-tron has been unveiled in Avant or estate form that's sadly not headed to India and this Sportback bodystyle which is headed to India in 2025. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback design The A6 e-tron looks substantial because it is. It's about the same size as the A6 petrol we are familiar with, but there's more mass to the design, something most noticeable at the sides. A black applique low down on the doors, there to also indicate the position of the battery, helps break the bulk. The fastback tail gives the A6 e-tron Sportback its eye-catching shape and to me, it looks best from the rear three-fourth angle. There's a lovely flow from roof to high-deck boot and the full-width lighting is really slick. A glowing rear logo is a first for an Audi and the digital OLED tail lamps almost have a language of their own with eight selectable patterns and the ability to display warning images to communicate hazards to vehicles behind. With split headlamps, a semi-concealed grille and a black ‘mask’ on the bumper to hide the air dams and ADAS hardware, frontal styling is a dramatic departure from the Audi template. The LED DRLs positioned up top get eight selectable patterns and this is a cool touch. A fact of note is that the A6 e-tron Sportback is the most aerodynamic Audi ever, and this bodes well for range. But, and this is just me, I'm not a fan of this newfangled organic styling. I like my Audi's angular. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback interior and features Inside, you'll see the latest from Audi and that's a good thing. The basic layout is similar to what we’ve seen on the Q6 e-tron which means it’s a cutting edge interior but also a screen-rich interior. There’s 11.9-inch digital dials, a 14.5-inch centre touchscreen as well as a 10.9-inch passenger screen. And that's not all. Versions with Virtual Mirrors (camera pods that replace the wing mirrors) also add in screens near the A-pillars. And lest I forget, there's also head-up display with augmented reality! The latest-gen digital dials are a huge upgrade from Audi’s Virtual Cockpit instruments we’ve seen for nearly a decade. It’s got crisp graphics, nice colours and plenty of info, though what’s missed is the option to go in-depth into EV stats. Over the driving I did find myself relying more on the head-up display, though. There's superb detailing and the augmented reality indications for ADAS and navigation that overlay warnings and symbols onto the driving environment are fantastic. The centre touchscreen is, again, slick and responsive but the menus can feel intimidating at first glance. Shortcuts and widgets do help personalise the screen for ease of use but packing in climate control settings on the screen is not ideal. Connected tech gives access to a full world of apps that can be downloaded on to the main screen. The passenger screen is a good way to keep your front passenger entertained while you're doing the hard work of driving a very nice and very soothing electric car. What’s nice is that the screen is not visible from the driver’s point of view on the go. Along with the closely related Q6 e-tron, the A6 e-tron marks a return to form for Audi in terms of quality. Everything you see and touch feels really high-end. The gloss look to the screens looks rich and goes well with the piano black on the center console. Also really nicely done are the touch-sensitive controls on the steering. They work really well and better than what we've seen on the latest lot of Mercedes cars. There’s a touch panel on the door too for the lights. Front seat comfort is good, helped in part by the option for ventilation, heating and massage. A leather-free interior is optional and I have to say the fabric upholstery on the seats and dashboard is tastefully done. Of the other elements, there's ambient lighting that subtly adds some color to the cabin and flashes warnings such as for safe exits. The A6 is also available with the option of a full glass roof that can go from transparent to opaque at the touch of a button. There's also the option of an 830-watt Bang \u0026 Olufsen sound system. Four of the 20 speakers are integrated onto the front headrest for a more personalized sound right near your ears. Soft close doors are part of the package too. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback rear seat and luggage capacity The rear seat experience isn’t quite as nice as the one up front. Kneeroom is decent but not exceptional for what is a large car with a long wheelbase, and headroom is just adequate for tall passengers. The backrest recline could be more relaxed too but the biggest spoiler is the knees-up seating position which is a recurring complaint on electric cars that position their battery pack under the floor. Oddly enough, Audi mitigated the problem on the e-tron GT with clever ‘foot garages’ or cutouts in the battery. The A6 e-tron uses a fully flat battery pack. Luggage capacity seems a lot larger than the 502 litres mentioned on the spec page. And should the need arise, you can fold down the rear seats to free up up to 1330 litres of room. There's no provision for a spare tyre, at least in this European spec. The tailgate is powered and handily, Audi has added in a light guide for the gesture control so you know precisely where to kick to activate the opening or closing function. There's a small 27-litre frunk too and uniquely, it too can be opened with a swipe on the bonnet. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback battery, motor and range On to the heart of the matter. The Audi A6 e-tron Sportback uses a lithium-ion battery pack with a nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry. Battery options include 83kWh and 100kWh capacities. The larger of the two is available with rear motor as well as dual motor, all-wheel-drive layouts. The version most likely headed to India is the Audi A6 e-tron Sportback Performance that uses a single rear permanent magnet synchronous motor. Power is rated at 367hp with up to 380hp on call with launch control. Peak torque is 565Nm. The headline number for this version, however, is range - 756 kilometres on the WLTP cycle. What’s more, the 800V architecture allows DC charging at up to 270kW, which means a 10-80% charge in just 21 minutes. We are still some time away before 270KW chargers become commonplace in India so the standard 11kW AC charging and optional 22kW AC charging capabilities are of greater relevance. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback performance and handling A drive around the breathtakingly gorgeous island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands gave an indication of what to expect. The Performance version might be the long variant of the A6 e-tron, well, range but it’s no slow coach. 0-100kph takes 5.4 seconds and top speed is capped at 210kph. Of course, this being an EV, it's fast, it's responsive and overtakings don't require much thinking. But what's different about the A6 is that it's not one of those EVs that slams you back onto your seat. Its build of power is nice and gradual and the general feeling is of an easygoing and chilled out car that wants to do luxury better than all other things. You feel as much when toggling between the drive modes too. There's comfort, efficiency, dynamic and balanced modes and each impact the throttle responses, steering and damping. Even in the sportiest of the driving modes, the A6 still feels very relaxed and gentle around the curves. Sure, there is nicer weight around the steering and the suspension does firm up but if you want an agile sporty car, you should probably be looking at the RS e-tron GT in Audi's lineup. Don't get me wrong because the A6 drives with confidence and is fun to drive when you're in the mood. It's just that it masks its speed eerily well. Refinement is spectacular and there’s only a bit of wind noise from the wing mirrors at speeds upwards of 100kph. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback ride comfort and braking The A6 e-tron Sportback is really good on ride comfort too. Steel springs are standard but higher-spec versions like our test car get air suspension. Unfortunately (or fortunately) there weren’t any India-spec potholes to test on our drive route in Tenerife. Even so, the 21-inch tyres dismissed any uneven surfaces with the air suspension doing a great job of keeping body movements in check.  Ride height lowers by 20mm in efficiency and dynamic modes for best aero but in India, owners will probably use the lift function more than anything else. Quick as the A6 is, it's just as happy to slow down. The A6 e-tron packs in regen braking and you can control the levels of regen using the paddleshifters. There's also a ‘B’ mode which brings in one pedal driving. It feels very natural and was my go to setting for the drive on the hills of Tenerife. The interesting thing is that Audi's system marries the motor braking with the actual friction brakes, so they work together to give a stronger effect of regen braking. What's really nice is that you can't sense that handover from regen braking to friction braking or when they're working together. The regen braking supplements the slippery shape, energy dense battery and high efficiency motor to deliver fantastic range. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback price and verdict The Audi A6 e-tron will follow the Q6 e-tron electric SUV and will likely launch in India in the second half of 2025, the A6 e-tron sportback has an eye-catching shape and is high-tech inside, though it's a vehicle to buy for the front seat experience rather than the one at the back. Refinement and range are highlights and even the middle-rung performance versions get you all the power that you can really use. We expect prices to be in the region of one crore rupees ex-showroom, which will be competitive for this size and class of electric car. The A6 e-tron Sportback represents the shape of things to come from Audi and it sure does impress.

Soft close doors are part of the package too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAudi A6 e-tron Sportback rear seat and luggage capacity\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe rear seat experience isn’t quite as nice as the one up front. Kneeroom is decent but not exceptional for what is a large car with a long wheelbase, and headroom is just adequate for tall passengers. The backrest recline could be more relaxed too but the biggest spoiler is the knees-up seating position which is a recurring complaint on electric cars that position their battery pack under the floor. Oddly enough, Audi mitigated the problem on the e-tron GT with clever ‘foot garages’ or cutouts in the battery. The A6 e-tron uses a fully flat battery pack.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Audi A6 e-tron review rear seat\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Audi-A6-e-tron-review-rear-seat.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"Audi A6 e-tron review rear seat\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLuggage capacity seems a lot larger than the 502 litres mentioned on the spec page. And should the need arise, you can fold down the rear seats to free up up to 1330 litres of room. There\u0026#39;s no provision for a spare tyre, at least in this European spec. The tailgate is powered and handily, Audi has added in a light guide for the gesture control so you know precisely where to kick to activate the opening or closing function. There\u0026#39;s a small 27-litre frunk too and uniquely, it too can be opened with a swipe on the bonnet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAudi A6 e-tron Sportback battery, motor and range\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn to the heart of the matter. The Audi A6 e-tron Sportback uses a lithium-ion battery pack with a nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry. Battery options include 83kWh and 100kWh capacities. The larger of the two is available with rear motor as well as dual motor, all-wheel-drive layouts. The version most likely headed to India is the Audi A6 e-tron Sportback Performance that uses a single rear permanent magnet synchronous motor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePower is rated at 367hp with up to 380hp on call with launch control. Peak torque is 565Nm. The headline number for this version, however, is range - 756 kilometres on the WLTP cycle. What’s more, the 800V architecture allows DC charging at up to 270kW, which means a 10-80% charge in just 21 minutes. We are still some time away before 270KW chargers become commonplace in India so the standard 11kW AC charging and optional 22kW AC charging capabilities are of greater relevance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAudi A6 e-tron Sportback performance and handling\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA drive around the breathtakingly gorgeous island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands gave an indication of what to expect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Audi A5 e-tron Sportback rear tracking\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Audi-A6-e-tron-rear-action.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"Audi A5 e-tron Sportback rear tracking\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Performance version might be the long variant of the A6 e-tron, well, range but it’s no slow coach. 0-100kph takes 5.4 seconds and top speed is capped at 210kph. Of course, this being an EV, it\u0026#39;s fast, it\u0026#39;s responsive and overtakings don\u0026#39;t require much thinking. But what\u0026#39;s different about the A6 is that it\u0026#39;s not one of those EVs that slams you back onto your seat. Its build of power is nice and gradual and the general feeling is of an easygoing and chilled out car that wants to do luxury better than all other things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou feel as much when toggling between the drive modes too. There\u0026#39;s comfort, efficiency, dynamic and balanced modes and each impact the throttle responses, steering and damping. Even in the sportiest of the driving modes, the A6 still feels very relaxed and gentle around the curves. Sure, there is nicer weight around the steering and the suspension does firm up but if you want an agile sporty car, you should probably be looking at the RS e-tron GT in Audi\u0026#39;s lineup. Don\u0026#39;t get me wrong because the A6 drives with confidence and is fun to drive when you\u0026#39;re in the mood. It\u0026#39;s just that it masks its speed eerily well. Refinement is spectacular and there’s only a bit of wind noise from the wing mirrors at speeds upwards of 100kph.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Audi A6 e-tron review Nikhil driving\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Audi-A6-e-tron-review-Nikhil-driving.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"Audi A6 e-tron review Nikhil driving\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAudi A6 e-tron Sportback ride comfort and braking\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe A6 e-tron Sportback is really good on ride comfort too. Steel springs are standard but higher-spec versions like our test car get air suspension. Unfortunately (or fortunately) there weren’t any India-spec potholes to test on our drive route in Tenerife. Even so, the 21-inch tyres dismissed any uneven surfaces with the air suspension doing a great job of keeping body movements in check.  Ride height lowers by 20mm in efficiency and dynamic modes for best aero but in India, owners will probably use the lift function more than anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Audi A5 e-tron Sportback front tracking\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Audi-A5-e-tron Sportback-front-tracking.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"Audi A5 e-tron Sportback front tracking\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eQuick as the A6 is, it\u0026#39;s just as happy to slow down. The A6 e-tron packs in regen braking and you can control the levels of regen using the paddleshifters. There\u0026#39;s also a ‘B’ mode which brings in one pedal driving. It feels very natural and was my go to setting for the drive on the hills of Tenerife. The interesting thing is that Audi\u0026#39;s system marries the motor braking with the actual friction brakes, so they work together to give a stronger effect of regen braking. What\u0026#39;s really nice is that you can\u0026#39;t sense that handover from regen braking to friction braking or when they\u0026#39;re working together. The regen braking supplements the slippery shape, energy dense battery and high efficiency motor to deliver fantastic range.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAudi A6 e-tron Sportback price and verdict\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Audi A6 e-tron will follow the Q6 e-tron electric SUV and will likely launch in India in the second half of 2025, the A6 e-tron sportback has an eye-catching shape and is high-tech inside, though it\u0026#39;s a vehicle to buy for the front seat experience rather than the one at the back.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRefinement and range are highlights and even the middle-rung performance versions get you all the power that you can really use. We expect prices to be in the region of one crore rupees ex-showroom, which will be competitive for this size and class of electric car.
