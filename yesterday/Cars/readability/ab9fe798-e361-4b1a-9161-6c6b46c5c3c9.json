  "description": "The MG Windsor will soon be updated with a larger battery pack option, say our sources. Besides this crucial addition, the Windsor is expected to receive more features, and the launch is expected as soon as next month. A new 50.6kWh battery pack is expected on the Windsor New feature additions will likely include an ADAS suite Updated Windsor launch expected next month Updated MG Windsor: what to expect? The Windsor is currently sold in India with a 38kWh battery pack, but it gets a larger 50.6kWh battery in Indonesia where it is sold as the Wuling Cloud EV. This same battery will make it to the India-spec model; it has a claimed range of 460km on the CLTC cycle. For reference, the existing 38kWh battery on the Windsor returns a range of 332km (ARAI-rated). However, the power and torque figures of 136hp and 200Nm are expected to remain unchanged with the larger battery, as will the front-wheel-drive configuration. Our sources have also hinted at an updated features list, the highlight of which will be the inclusion of an ADAS suite.   New battery could bring a notable update to real-world range In our real-world efficiency tests, the Windsor fared really well, returning an efficiency of 8.1km/kWh and a range of 308km – just 24km off the claimed figure. For reference, The Nexon EV with a larger 45kWh battery returned a real-world range of 350km but with a lower efficiency of 7.79km/kWh. The larger battery could take the Windsor’s range closer to 400km, probably making it viable even for trips outside the city. MG Windsor sales in India It is currently outselling the Nexon EV  Since its launch in September 2024, the Windsor alone has given significant boost to MG’s sales in India. In the seven months between September 2024 and March 2025, the Windsor sold 19,394 units, averaging more than 2,700 units a month. More importantly, it has consistently been outselling its chief rival, the Tata Nexon EV, which had long been the undisputed bestseller in the EV segment. The addition of the larger battery surely will give a further impetus to its sales. But expect a reasonable bump in its ex-showroom price, which currently ranges between Rs 14 lakh and Rs 16 lakh.  Also See: Renault Duster, Bigster hybrid under evaluation for India Tata Nexon EV 5-star BNCAP safety rating extended to 45kWh variants",
