  "text": "The ID.7 was slated to have 282 hp and an EPA range in excess of 300 miles January 28, 2025 at 19:35 by Michael Gauthier Volkswagen has reportedly decided not to offer the ID.7 in North America. The model was originally slated to arrive last year, but was indefinitely delayed. A spokesperson chalked the decision up to the “challenging EV climate.” Volkswagen pulled out all the stops when they introduced the ID.7 and we covered it live from New York in the spring of 2023. The model was originally planned to be launched in America the following year, but that never happened. As Volkswagen explained in May of 2024, they were “committed to making market-driven choices while listening to our customers.” The company went on to say they were delaying the North American launch of the ID.7 due, in part, to changing market dynamics. 2025 Volkswagen ID.7 Tourer Review: An EV For The Long Haul The company didn’t say when the ID.7 would finally arrive stateside, but Volkswagen Group of America CEO Pablo Di Si later said it would likely be launched in 2025. However, at the time, he cautioned nothing was set in stone and everything was conditional on “consumer demand.” Fast forward to today and it appears the ID.7 will become forbidden fruit. We’ve reached out for comment, but Volkswagen told Automotive News they no longer plan to offer the electric liftback in North America. A spokesperson blamed this on the “challenging EV climate,” which has seen slower adoption than many automakers anticipated. Michael Gauthier / Carscoops While the ID.7 is apparently dead in America, the spokesperson said “Electric vehicles continue to be a core part of Volkswagen’s long-term product strategy, and new electric models will continue to be introduced for this market.” We’ll update this post if we hear back from Volkswagen, but the ID.7 was always going to face an uphill battle in America. Cars have fallen out of favor with consumers and the company suggested the model would be expensive as it’s the flagship of the ID lineup. This suggests the model could have been even more costly than the ID. Buzz, which starts at $59,995.",
