  "text": "Published:  October 31st, 2024 Suzuki hasn't sold cars in the U.S. for a bit over a decade now, but the company will be working with Toyota -- which is a part of owner of Suzuki -- on a planned EV. This got me thinking -- should Suzuki return?Most of you would likely think \"no\" -- after all, the brand was struggling so badly it needed to leave in the first place. And other than the fun but too-small-inside Kizashi, Suzuki didn't have anything really worth buying, anyway, you might say.What if I told you, however, that there are opportunities to sell a cheap car, since that part of that market has been hollowed out? And, of course, people keep hoping the Jimny comes here. I'd like to see it as a Wrangler competitor. Yeah, fine, today's Halloween and I've already dipped into the candy as an afternoon snack -- so maybe this is a sugar-induced fever dream. But can you imagine if Suzuki returned as a value brand with a couple of attractive models?Sound off below.[Image: Suzuki]Become a TTAC insider.

Tim Healey Tim Healey grew up around the auto-parts business and has always had a love for cars — his parents joke his first word was “‘Vette”. Despite this, he wanted to pursue a career in sports writing but he ended up falling semi-accidentally into the automotive-journalism industry, first at Consumer Guide Automotive and later at Web2Carz.com. He also worked as an industry analyst at Mintel Group and freelanced for About.com, CarFax, Vehix.com, High Gear Media, Torque News, FutureCar.com, Cars.com, among others, and of course Vertical Scope sites such as AutoGuide.com, Off-Road.com, and HybridCars.com. He’s an urbanite and as such, doesn’t need a daily driver, but if he had one, it would be compact, sporty, and have a manual transmission.
