Inside, bucket seats are accompanied by a Raid steering wheel, a gated shifter, and air conditioning along with a fold-out Kenwood head unit connected to a backup camera. Now showing 41k kilometers (~25k miles), this Countach 5000 QV is offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a California title. Introduced as a prototype in 1971, the Countach was designed by Bertone’s Marcello Gandini with angular wedge-shaped styling and scissor doors. The car features a tubular steel space frame under aluminum bodywork as well as NACA ducts aft of the doors and air intakes above the rear quarters. The 5000 QV model debuted in 1985 and utilized Kevlar front and rear deck lids. This example left the factory finished in Rosso Siviglia and was repainted in the early 2010s. It features European-specification bumpers and a V-shaped rear wing along with pop-up headlights paired with Carello fog lights up front. The 15″ Gotti multi-piece wheels feature red accents and are mounted with Pirelli P Zero Asimmetrico tires. The Countach features a fully independent suspension with coil springs and telescopic shock absorbers, and stopping power is provided by four-wheel ventilated disc brakes. The cockpit houses bucket seats upholstered in Champagne leather along with a matching center console, lower dashboard, and door panels. A fold-out Kenwood head unit with a DVD player is connected to a backup camera and a CD changer as well as an aftermarket amplifier and speakers. Further interior appointments include a Jaeger digital clock as well as air conditioning and hand-crank windows. The leather-wrapped Raid steering wheel is paired with a gated dogleg-pattern shifter fitted with an aftermarket knob. It fronts Jaeger instrumentation including a 320-km/h speedometer and a tachometer with a 7,500-rpm redline along with auxiliary readouts. The six-digit odometer shows 41k kilometers (~25k miles), approximately 21k of which have been added under current ownership. The Carfax report lists mileage inconsistencies in January 1993, June 2003, and June 2005. The fuel-level gauge does not work. The Bizzarrini-designed 5.2-liter V12 features a 60° cylinder bank angle, four valves per cylinder, and Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection. Output was factory rated at 420 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. The car last passed a California emissions test in May 2020. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, the former of which is mounted in the middle of the car, ahead of the engine.
