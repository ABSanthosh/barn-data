The car is refinished in black over black vinyl and is powered by a 351ci Ford Cleveland V8 paired with a five-speed ZF manual transaxle. Features include 15″ Campagnolo cast magnesium wheels, adjustable coilovers, four-wheel disc brakes, pop-up headlights, quad exhaust outlets, a gated shifter, air conditioning, and power windows. The battery, air conditioning compressor and hoses, and deck lid struts were replaced in the past year. This Pantera is now offered with a Marti report, manufacturer’s literature, spare parts, a tool kit, and a clean California title. The Pantera’s bodywork was designed under the direction of American designer Tom Tjaarda. This example was originally finished in silver and was then refinished in black, reportedly in 1974. Paint cracking is visible around the car. Features include pop-up headlights, chrome bumpers, bright window trim, a rear luggage rack, and quad exhaust outlets. The deck lid struts were replaced in preparation for the sale. Silver-finished 15″ Campagnolo cast magnesium wheels are mounted with 205/60 front and 255/50 rear BFGoodrich Radial T/A tires. The car is equipped with adjustable coilovers, and braking is handled by power-assisted discs at each corner. The bucket seats are trimmed in black vinyl, and interior equipment includes a gated shifter, air conditioning, shoulder belts, power windows, and a Kenwood cassette stereo. The seller states that the air conditioning compressor and hoses were replaced in 2023. The MOMO steering wheel frames a Veglia 200-mph speedometer and an 8k-rpm tachometer. The removed factory steering wheel is included in the sale. Auxiliary gauges for amperage, fuel level, water temperature, and oil pressure are stationed in the center stack. The five-digit odometer shows 72k miles, approximately 64k of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 351ci Ford Cleveland V8 featured a four-barrel carburetor from the factory for a rating of 264 horsepower and 314 lb-ft of torque. The battery was replaced in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a ZF five-speed manual transaxle. The coating on the underside is flaking and the condition is shown in the gallery. The Deluxe Marti Report lists factory equipment and production statistics. Manufacturer’s literature, a tool kit, and spare parts are included in the sale. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
