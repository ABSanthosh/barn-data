One of 2,022 built for the model year and a no-top-stripe example, it is finished in Quick Silver over Ebony leather upholstery. Equipment includes a six-speed manual gearbox, a helical limited-slip differential, Brembo brakes, HID headlights, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, and air conditioning. Following registration history in New Jersey, Florida, and Texas, the car was acquired by the selling dealer in 2025. This Ford GT has 10k miles and is offered with a clean Carfax report and a clean Texas title. The Camilo Pardo-designed GT was styled as an homage to the Le Mans-winning GT40 racing cars of the 1960s and features aluminum body panels over an extruded-aluminum space frame and roll-bonded floors. This example is one of 156 finished in Quick Silver for the model year, and it is not equipped with racing stripes or side tape stripes. Features include Ford GT graphics, HID headlights, fog lights, side air intakes, a vented hood, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, and a dual center-exit exhaust system. The selling dealer states the clear bra has aged and could use to be replaced, and photos provided in the gallery below show scrapes and dents in the front splitter. Painted cast-aluminum wheels measure 18″ up front and 19″ out back and are mounted with 235/40 front and 345/35, respectively, Bridgestone Potenza RE050A tires produced in 2023. The Brembo braking system features four-piston monoblock calipers with cross-drilled and ventilated rotors that measure 14” up front and 13.2” out back. The cockpit is trimmed in Ebony leather, and embroidered carpet mats cover bare aluminum floors. Manually adjusted seats were designed by Sparco and feature carbon-fiber shells with GT40-style ventilation grommets and harness slots. The console on the center tunnel houses rotary climate controls, and amenities include air conditioning, remote keyless entry, a Safecraft fire extinguisher, and push-button ignition along with a Kenwood touchscreen infotainment unit that has a rearview-camera display and is connected to dual subwoofers and Genesis Profile Two Ultra amplifiers. The tilt- and reach-adjustable, leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a GT40-inspired instrument array consisting of a central tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline and an offset 220-mph speedometer. Toggle-switch controls are positioned under additional gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, boost, and fuel level, and a fuel/air-ratio gauge has been fitted in place of the factory voltmeter. The digital odometer indicates 10k miles, approximately 12 of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 5.4-liter DOHC V8’s factory supercharger has been replaced by a twin-turbocharger kit said to have been installed by M2K Motorsports in Katy, Texas. An Accufab throttle body and MoTeC engine management are in place, and photos showing cylinder-compression readings can be viewed in the gallery. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Ricardo six-speed manual transaxle fitted with a Setrab cooler as well as a helical limited-slip differential. The Carfax report is free of accident or damage entries. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
