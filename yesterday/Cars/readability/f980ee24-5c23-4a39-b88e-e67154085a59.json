  "text": "This 2008 Bugatti Veyron 16.4 is the 74th of 252 coupes produced in the model’s original configuration between 2005 and 2011 and is the 22nd of just 76 built for delivery to the US. The car is powered by a quad-turbocharged 8.0-liter W16 with four valves per cylinder that sends a factory-rated 987 horsepower to all four wheels via a Ricardo seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and a Haldex traction-control system. Finished in black with white accents, the car also features adaptive boost-pressure fuel injection, dry-sump engine and gearbox lubrication, 10 radiators, carbon-ceramic brakes with titanium calipers, a carbon-fiber monocoque, a rear wing that serves as an airbrake, conical wheels mounted with special Michelin PAX run-flat tires, and beige leather upholstery. Purchased by its current owner in 2019, this Veyron is now offered on dealer consignment with invoices from current ownership, a high-speed key, a clean Carfax report, and a New York title. Development of the Veyron began after the 1998 acquisition of the Bugatti brand by Volkswagen, who subsequently introduced a series of W-engined, all-wheel-drive concept cars. The final concept was presented in 2000 and carried the Veyron moniker in honor of race car driver and engineer Pierre Veyron, who piloted a Bugatti Type 57C to victory at the 1939 24 Hours of Le Mans. The model set a production-car record with a top speed of 253 mph during testing before assembly of the Veyron began in Molsheim in September 2005. Construction comprises a carbon-fiber monocoque passenger cell, an aluminum front frame, and a rear structure consisting of carbon fiber, aerospace-grade stainless steel, and aluminum. This example’s aluminum and carbon-fiber body panels are finished in black with white front fenders, door panels, and coves, while bright accents include exposed aluminum rear intake snorkels and a titanium “horseshoe” grille. Adaptive aerodynamic features include variable ride height, front diffuser flaps, a rear diffuser, and an active rear wing and tail spoiler. Aluminum wheels measure 500mm in inner diameter up front and 540mm out back and are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport PAX tires that were engineered specifically for the Veyron. The tires measure 265/680 and 365/710 at the front and rear, respectively, with run-flat ability provided by polymer rings bonded to the wheels. Braking is handled by 15.7” carbon-ceramic discs and eight-piston, four-pad titanium calipers up front along with 15” discs and six-piston, two-pad calipers out back. The rear wing automatically shifts to a 55° angle to assist in braking from high speeds. The cabin features bucket seats with carbon-fiber shells trimmed in beige leather along with matching upholstery over the door panels, console, and dashboard. Color-keyed Alcantara covers the rear firewall, sills, and headliner, while black carpeting lines the footwells. The dash and console are accented by a single-piece machine-turned aluminum panel that hosts the gearshift as well as a clock and controls for the automatic climate control and the Burmester sound system. The car is also equipped with power windows that automatically close when the car reaches 100 mph. The three-spoke steering wheel fronts magnesium paddle shifters and instrumentation that includes a central tachometer with an inset digital display flanked by a 280-mph speedometer and a horsepower gauge. The digital odometer shows 3,800 miles, approximately 200 of which have been added under current ownership. A key slot on the sill to the left of the driver’s seat allows the insertion of a separate key to initiate “top speed” capability. The Volkswagen-designed 8.0-liter W16 incorporates a single crankshaft shared by two cylinder banks set at a 90° angle, with each bank consisting of eight cylinders set in a 15° V-configuration. Each bank is topped by a single cylinder head with dual overhead camshafts operating four valves per cylinder. Four turbochargers push air through two intercoolers into twin intake manifolds, while adaptive fuel injection continuously adjusts fuel pressure relative to boost. Power output was factory rated at 987 horsepower and 922 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to all four wheels through a Ricardo seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and two differentials via Haldex electronic control. Both the engine and gearbox feature dry-sump lubrication with individual oil coolers that are among a total of 10 heat exchangers, the other eight of which handle the engine coolant, intercoolers, rear differential, and air conditioning. Service performed approximately 100 miles ago in 2022 included fluid changes and replacement of the filters, spark plugs, battery, gearbox oil pump, and oil power distributor. Suspension incorporates double wishbones with Bilstein three-stage hydroelectric coilover dampers with three active ride-height adjustment modes. A plaque under the front hood identifies the car as the 74th chassis and notes delivery to the US. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other issues and lists a most recent safety and emissions inspection at 3,763 miles in March 2025.

Each bank is topped by a single cylinder head with dual overhead camshafts operating four valves per cylinder. Four turbochargers push air through two intercoolers into twin intake manifolds, while adaptive fuel injection continuously adjusts fuel pressure relative to boost. Power output was factory rated at 987 horsepower and 922 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to all four wheels through a Ricardo seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and two differentials via Haldex electronic control. Both the engine and gearbox feature dry-sump lubrication with individual oil coolers that are among a total of 10 heat exchangers, the other eight of which handle the engine coolant, intercoolers, rear differential, and air conditioning. Service performed approximately 100 miles ago in 2022 included fluid changes and replacement of the filters, spark plugs, battery, gearbox oil pump, and oil power distributor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_img_3768-97984.jpeg?w=620\u0026amp;resize=620%2C413\" alt=\"2008 Bugatti Veyron 16.4\" width=\"620\" height=\"413\" srcset=\"https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_img_3768-97984.jpeg?w=2048 2048w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_img_3768-97984.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_img_3768-97984.jpeg?w=768 768w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_img_3768-97984.jpeg?w=620\u0026amp;resize=620%2C413 620w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_img_3768-97984.jpeg?w=1536 1536w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_img_3768-97984.jpeg?w=460 460w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_img_3768-97984.jpeg?w=144 144w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_img_3768-97984.jpeg?w=940 940w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_img_3768-97984.jpeg?w=1240 1240w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_img_3768-97984.jpeg?w=1860 1860w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuspension incorporates double wishbones with Bilstein three-stage hydroelectric coilover dampers with three active ride-height adjustment modes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_2008-bugatti-veyron-16-4-23-98006.png?w=620\u0026amp;resize=620%2C413\" alt=\"2008 Bugatti Veyron 16.4\" width=\"620\" height=\"413\" srcset=\"https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_2008-bugatti-veyron-16-4-23-98006.png?w=1620 1620w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_2008-bugatti-veyron-16-4-23-98006.png?w=300 300w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_2008-bugatti-veyron-16-4-23-98006.png?w=768 768w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_2008-bugatti-veyron-16-4-23-98006.png?w=620\u0026amp;resize=620%2C413 620w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_2008-bugatti-veyron-16-4-23-98006.png?w=1536 1536w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_2008-bugatti-veyron-16-4-23-98006.png?w=460 460w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_2008-bugatti-veyron-16-4-23-98006.png?w=144 144w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_2008-bugatti-veyron-16-4-23-98006.png?w=940 940w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2008_bugatti_veyron-16.4_2008-bugatti-veyron-16-4-23-98006.png?w=1240 1240w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA plaque under the front hood identifies the car as the 74th chassis and notes delivery to the US.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Carfax report is free of accidents or other issues and lists a most recent safety and emissions inspection at 3,763 miles in March 2025.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a lien on the title, and the owner’s lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the next owner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\t\tYou are not connected to real-time updates.
