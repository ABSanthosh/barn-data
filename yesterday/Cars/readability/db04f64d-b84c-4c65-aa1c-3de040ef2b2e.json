The car is powered by a 3.2-liter flat-six paired with a G50 five-speed manual transaxle and is finished in black over black leather upholstery. Equipment includes 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels, a limited-slip differential, a black soft top, a fiberglass twin-hump convertible-top cover panel, air conditioning, cruise control, power-adjustable sport seats, and a Blaupunkt cassette stereo. Work performed in preparation for the sale has included replacing the tires, fuel filter, fuel tank sending unit, spark plugs, and drive belts. This 911 Speedster is offered on dealer consignment with a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, manufacturer’s literature, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Oklahoma title. The car features widened rear bodywork shared with the contemporary 911 Turbo, a fiberglass twin-hump convertible-top rear deck, and a shortened windscreen and side windows when compared to the standard Carrera. This example is finished in black with a black soft top and features integrated fog lights, rear bumperettes, stone guards, and a single exhaust outlet. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. Staggered-width 16″ Fuchs wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero Rosso tires that have 2023 date codes. Braking is handled by black Porsche-script calipers over cross-drilled rotors at all four corners. The brake fluid was changed in 2024. The power-adjustable sport seats are upholstered in black leather and are complemented by a color-coordinated dashboard, door panels, and carpets. Equipment includes cruise control, a rear storage compartment, a Blaupunkt cassette stereo, and air conditioning, the latter of which was recharged in 2024. The Speedster was not equipped with rear seats. The four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,300-rpm redline flanked by a 170-mph speedometer, an analog clock, and gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, oil level, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 8k miles. The 3.2-liter flat-six features Bosch fuel injection and was factory rated at 215 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The oil was changed, the fuel injectors were serviced, and the fuel filter, fuel tank sending unit, spark plugs, and drive belts were replaced in 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a G50 five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The transaxle fluid and clutch fluid were changed in 2024. The Porsche Certificate of Authenticity shows factory colors, equipment, and a production completion date of June 1989. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
