Powered by a 5.2-liter Voodoo V8 linked with a Tremec six-speed manual transmission and a Torsen limited-slip differential, the car is finished in Shadow Black over Ebony cloth and Miko suede upholstery with red accents. It features over-the-top black racing stripes with red accents as well as a carbon-fiber wing, a carbon-composite front grille, HID projector headlights, functional hood and fender vents, a MagneRide damping system, Brembo brake calipers, dual-zone automatic climate control, blind-spot monitoring (BLIS), a 12-speaker Bang \u0026 Olufsen sound system, and a touchscreen infotainment system with voice-activated navigation. This GT350R is offered with a window sticker, factory literature and accessories, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean Connecticut title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in Shadow Black (G1) with optional over-the-top black racing stripes with red accents. Additional exterior details include a carbon-fiber wing, a carbon-composite front grille, HID projector headlights, functional hood and fender vents, a front splitter with Shelby lettering, and LED taillights with sequential turn signals. Carbon-fiber 19″ wheels are mounted with 305/30 front and 315/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. The R-specification suspension features a MagneRide damping system, and braking is handled by disc brakes featuring two-piece brake rotors and Brembo calipers at all four corners. The Recaro sport seats are trimmed in Ebony cloth and Miko suede with red accents, and the rear seat is omitted on R models. Exposed carbon-fiber trim accents the dashboard, and additional appointments include dual-zone automatic climate control, cruise control, blind-spot monitoring (BLIS), a rearview camera, a 12-speaker Bang \u0026 Olufsen sound system, and a touchscreen infotainment system with voice-activated navigation. The leather- and Alcantara-trimmed steering wheel fronts a 200-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and a configurable central display along with gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. Auxiliary gauges for oil pressure and oil temperature are housed in the center of the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 180 miles, approximately 170 of which were added under current ownership. The passenger-side dashboard plaque designates this GT350R as chassis LR354. The 5.2-liter Voodoo V8 features a flat-plane crankshaft along with an engine oil cooler, dual overhead camshafts per cylinder bank with variable valve timing, and an open-element air filter. A commemorative plaque displays the signature of the engine builder, and factory-rated output was 526 horsepower and 429 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Tremec six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Additional underside photos can be viewed in the gallery below. The included window sticker lists factory colors and equipment along with a total MSRP of $78,020. Factory literature and accessories will also accompany the car. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage and displays at least one open recall.  You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
