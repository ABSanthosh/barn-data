The car is powered by a 2.9-liter quad-cam V8 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle, and it is finished in red over tan leather upholstery.

This 308 GTB was acquired by its current owner on BaT in March 2022 and is now offered by the seller with manufacturer’s literature, service records, a trophy, a tool roll, and a clean Texas title in the name of the current owner’s LLC. The 308 GTB was introduced at the 1975 Paris Motor Show and featured Pininfarina-styled bodywork. Early production models featured fiberglass bodywork by Carrozzeria Scaglietti before the coachbuilder switched to steel body panels in June 1977. This example was produced in November 1977 and is finished in Rosso Chiaro (20-R-190). Details include US-market lighting and bumpers, a vented decklid, and a retractable antenna. Silver 14″ Cromodora wheels are mounted with 205/70 Michelin XWX tires. The car rides on Koni shock absorbers, and replacement control arm bushings were installed in October 2021. stopping power is provided by ventilated discs at each corner. The cockpit features bolstered seats trimmed in tan leather with black accents sourced from Tappezzeria Luppi of Modena, Italy, in December 2013. Red Wilton wool carpets were installed by Lane’s Trim Shop of Stuart, Florida, in November of that year, and the interior also has air conditioning, a gated shifter, power windows, and a Blaupunkt Frankfurt cassette stereo. Four replacement switch toggles were fitted in October 2021. The leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel fronts Veglia instrumentation including a 180-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 7,700-rpm redline, and supplementary gauges for monitoring fuel level, coolant temperature, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 41k miles, approximately 200 of which have been added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 2.9L quad-cam V8 is equipped with four twin-choke Weber 40DCNF carburetors and was factory rated at 237 horsepower for the US market. An October 2021 engine-out service was performed under previous ownership that included rebuilds of the cylinder heads and starter as well as the installation of a replacement water pump, bearings, belts, gaskets, seals, and a choke cable. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle. A replacement ANSA muffler is installed, and the exhaust cover is missing. A 1st in class trophy from the 2014 Cavallino Classic in Palm Beach, Florida, is shown above along with a binder including manufacturer’s literature, service records, and past ownership documents.
