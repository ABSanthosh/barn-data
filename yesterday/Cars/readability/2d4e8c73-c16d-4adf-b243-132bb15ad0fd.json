Power is supplied by a 3.0L flat-six equipped with dual Weber carburetors and linked with a five-speed 915 manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential. It rides on 16″ Group 4 wheels with 1984 Carrera suspension and brake components, and the car has been repainted in its factory shade of Metallic Blue. Inside, the cabin houses Recaro sport seats with harnesses, RS-style door panels, power windows, a MOMO steering wheel, and an aftermarket shifter. This longhood 911T coupe is now offered with a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, the removed engine block, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The car came finished from the factory in Metallic Blue and was repainted during the build following the installation of steel fender flares and an American International Racing fiberglass ducktail decklid and front bumper. H4 headlights with yellow lenses were also added in addition to white Porsche stripe graphics, front trunk latches, and a dual-outlet exhaust. The seller notes various chips and scratches, and a crack in the decklid is pointed out in the gallery. The 16” Group 4 PAG wheels are mounted with Pirelli P-Zero Trofeo R tires measuring 225/50 up front and 245/45 out back. The car has been fitted with the suspension, sway bars, brakes, rear trailing arms, and cross brace from a 1984 911 Carrera. The Recaro front sport seats are upholstered in black leather with patterned inserts and feature G-Force harnesses that are attached to the welded-in roll bar. The rear seats have been removed, and further highlights include RS-style door panels, lightweight carpets, custom rubber floor mats, an aftermarket shifter, and power windows. There are cracks in the dashboard. The three-spoke MOMO Prototipo steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation consisting of a 150-mph speedometer, a rotated 8k-rpm tachometer, an analog clock, and auxiliary gauges for fuel level, oil level, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer was reset to zero at the time of the build and now shows 2,300 miles. The 3.0L flat-six was installed under prior ownership and was reportedly sourced from a 1980 911. The dual Weber 40 IDA carburetors were rebuilt and modified with PMO components, and further additions include PMO intake manifolds, a fuel pressure gauge, MSD electronic ignition, an oil cooler in the right front fender, and exhaust headers. The seller tells us that the engine was rebuilt with hydraulic tensioners and 930 valve covers. Compression test results are viewable in the gallery. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a five-speed 915 manual transaxle, which reportedly features a magnesium case and a 7.31:1 limited-slip differential. The Porsche Certificate of Authenticity shows the factory colors and optional equipment. The removed 2.2L flat-six engine case is included in the sale, and serial number *6114629* is viewable in the gallery, with a corresponding number listed on the CoA above.
