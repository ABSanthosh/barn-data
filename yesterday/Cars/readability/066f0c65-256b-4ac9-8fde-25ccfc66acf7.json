  "text": "Beauty was once defined as: “The adjustment of all parts proportionately so that one cannot add or subtract or change without impairing the harmony of the whole.” These words, penned by Leon Battista Alberti, a Renaissance poet who lived 400 years before the invention of the motor vehicle, perfectly describe the essence of the Ferrari 206 S Dino Spyder. During Pistonheads’ annual event at Bicester Heritage, I finally had the chance to see this car in person. Set against the backdrop of what was once the Royal Air Force Guard House, the 206 S was elegantly displayed among other iconic Ferraris. Girardo \u0026 Co., one of the UK’s premier classic car dealers and the current custodian of the 206 S, offered a glimpse into their impressive inventory. From a distance, you could mistake the 206 S for a Ferrari P330, but as you approach, its smaller, lighter frame – over 200kg less than its sibling – becomes apparent. Both models hail from the renowned workshops of Carrozzeria Sports Cars and are often referred to as Drogo-bodied cars, named after Piero Drogo, a founder of the design house. The 1960s ushered in an era of advanced aerodynamics and technology. No longer was it all about smooth, simple profiles and tall, spoked wheels, and the 206 S is a testament to this evolution. It showcases a design that flows gracefully, with bodywork that seems to envelop the chassis like a silk gown, with few straight lines throughout. The longer you take it in, the more subtle details emerge. A crease along the front fenders remain hidden from some angles yet cut sharply from others, tapering seamlessly into the bodyline before forming a break in the rear arches. Among its peers, the 206 S is highly coveted. Only 18 were built, with just 13 in Spyder form. Of these, just two featured the highest specification engine: the Formula One-derived Tipo 233 S V6. The mechanical brutality of the engine is at odds with the bodywork, emphasising function over aesthetics. Six intake stacks draw air through meshed panels in the deck lid, producing an incredible soundtrack. For a taste of this sound, check out the video Girardo \u0026 Co. released – make sure to turn the volume up! With 270 horsepower, the 206 S boasts an impressive power-to-weight ratio, needing to propel just 650kg (1,433lbs) plus the driver. Its spartan interior further aids in weight reduction, featuring a minimalist dashboard dominated by a prominent central tachometer. Other than two low-back bucket seats divided by the exposed gear linkage and gated shifter, little else shares the compact cabin. Competing in the 1967 FIA World Sports Car Championship, the 206 S raced in the sub-2000cc class alongside the P330/4. Though it had limited success in endurance racing, the 206 S excelled in European hillclimb events, where its lightweight build, nimble handling, and strong power output proved a capable combination. As time passes, cars are becoming larger and often more garish. Styling has shifted towards angular designs, creases and surfaces with little cohesion across the entire product. Safety regulations have certainly played a big part in this, yet if companies like Mazda can still produce the MX-5, perhaps it’s time to ask ourselves: “Where did we go wrong?” Chaydon Ford Instagram: chaycore OFFICIAL SPEEDHUNTERS SUPPLIERS",
