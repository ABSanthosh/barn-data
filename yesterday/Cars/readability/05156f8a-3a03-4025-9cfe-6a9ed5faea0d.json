Power is provided by a 4.0-liter flat-six paired with a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle, and other equipment includes Satin Neodyme 20″ forged-magnesium wheels, a Bose surround-sound system, CFRP full bucket seats, bi-xenon headlights, and Racing Yellow seatbelts. The car was purchased new by the seller’s father before he recently sold it to the seller. Indicating 1,500 miles, this 718 Cayman GT4 RS is now offered with a window sticker, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean North Carolina title in the seller’s name. The 718 GT4 RS features lightweight rear glass, vented front fenders, additional upper intakes, and a larger swan-neck rear wing when compared with the contemporary 718 GT4. Weissach Package-equipped cars are denoted by titanium tailpipes as well as exposed carbon-fiber weave on the hood, intakes, side mirror housings, and wing. This example is finished in Gentian Blue Metallic (M5D) and is fitted with bi-xenon headlights, ParkAssist rear parking sensors, and integrated dual exhaust outlets exiting through the rear diffuser. The car was ordered with the optional $1,990 partially painted carbon-fiber front trunk lid and spoiler as well as yellow badging. The front lip spoiler and right-front fender liner were replaced in October 2024, and an inspection at that time noted damage to the front bumper cover. Satin Neodyme-finished 20″ forged-magnesium center-lock wheels are mounted with Dunlop Sport Maxx Race 2 tires. The right-rear tire was replaced in November 2024. A front-axle lift system was optioned from the factory as were Porsche Ceramic-Composite Brakes (PCCB) featuring yellow Porsche-branded calipers at all four corners. The carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) full bucket seats are upholstered in black leather and Arctic Gray Race-Tex with “Weissach RS” headrest embroidery and Racing Yellow seatbelts. Other interior appointments include carbon-fiber trim, dual-zone automatic climate control, a Bose surround-sound system, and PCM infotainment with navigation. The Race-Tex-wrapped steering wheel features a yellow centering stripe and fronts a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline flanked by a 200-mph speedometer and a configurable digital display. The optional Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 1,500 miles. The mid-mounted 4.0L flat-six was factory rated at 493 horsepower and 331 lb-ft of torque. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle, and the car is equipped with Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV) and a mechanically locking differential. The window sticker notes initial delivery to Porsche Larchmont in New York and lists factory equipment, colors, options, and a total price of $200,090. Service records are also included in the sale.
