  "text": "Volkswagen's delayed Passat-sized electric sedan could finally come to North America in 2025 October 23, 2024 at 20:07 by Michael Gauthier Volkswagen Group of America’s CEO has said the ID.7 could come stateside in 2025. The model was originally slated to arrive this year, but was delayed due to “market dynamics.” VW previously said the US-spec ID.7 will be well-equipped and available with both RWD and AWD. Volkswagen was looking to make a splash with the ID.7 and we were on hand for its debut in New York last year. While the Passat-sized electric liftback was slated to arrive in America in the third quarter of 2024, the company walked back those plans in May. At the time, the automaker said “as market dynamics continue to change, Volkswagen is delaying the introduction of the ID.7 sedan in the U.S. and Canada.” The company went on to suggest lackluster EV demand and a preference for crossovers was to blame as they cited a desire to make “market-driven choices while listening to our customers.” First Look: The VW ID.7 Is An Electric Passat For A New Generation Fast forward to today and Volkswagen Group of America CEO Pablo Di Si has suggested the ID.7 could be launched as early as next year. Speaking to Auto News, he said “We’re ready to launch the ID.7 as long as there’s consumer demand. We’ll probably launch it next year,” but “we haven’t decided yet.” While plans remain in flux, Volkswagen has previously said the American ID.7 will be offered in Pro S and Pro S Plus guise. The entry-level model was slated to have illuminated logos, a power liftgate, a panoramic glass roof, and 19-inch wheels. Other highlights were set to include a heated steering wheel, heated front seats, and a 15-inch infotainment system. Initial powertrain details revealed that the U.S.-spec model would offer an 82 kWh battery pack, with rear- and all-wheel-drive options. The RWD version is expected to deliver 282 hp (210 kW / 286 PS) and around 406 lb-ft (550 Nm) of torque, while the AWD variant ups the power to 335 hp (250 kW / 340 PS). It’s also worth pointing out that Volkswagen has confirmed both the European and North American versions of the ID.7 would be built in Emden, Germany. This decision is more than just a production detail; it’s a move that could have significant implications for the ID.7’s eligibility for U.S. tax credits under current EV policies.
