The body was removed from the frame and refinished in Tangelo Orange accented by Mar-K trim, a custom-fabricated narrowed frame was installed along with narrowed axles and a four-link rear end, CPP disc brakes and 24″ Raceline wheels were installed along with QA1 suspension, and a built 6.2-liter LS3 V8, 4L70E automatic, and Positraction differential were fitted. The truck also has a custom Pedro Gomez interior with brown leather upholstery, a white hardtop with a folding fabric panel, coilover suspension, tucked bumpers, Vintage Air climate control, a tilt column, and more as described below. Previously offered on BaT in July 2024, this K5 Blazer is now offered with a clean California title in the seller’s name. The seller reports that the body was removed from the frame before it was repainted Tangelo Orange with off-white lower sections. The hardtop was redone with a textured finish in matching off-white, and it was modified with a folding soft top that measures approximately 40×70″. LED lighting was installed along with a hidden gas filler behind the taillight and Mar-K trim, and the smoothed bumpers were tucked. The side mirrors have integrated blinkers. The custom-fabricated frame was designed and mini-tubbed to fit the larger wheels and tires. The axles were also narrowed, and a four-link rear end was installed along with a front sway bar, adjustable QA1 coilover suspension, and CPP four-wheel disc brakes with slotted front rotors. The 24″ Raceline wheels wear 405/25 Pirelli tires out back. The interior was customized by Pedro Gomez according to the seller. Chocolate upholstery covers the bucket seats and rear bench, and a center console was installed along with a Vintage Air climate control system. The door panels are accented by body-color trim, and the dashboard pad has contrasting stitching. Woodgrain trim accents the body-color dashboard, which also has a touchscreen mounted in the center. Work since the prior auction consisted of installing a headliner, rear carpeting, and seat belts. The billet steering wheel is mounted on a tilt column, and it frames Dakota Digital instrumentation. The seller states that 170 miles have been added since completion, though total chassis mileage is unknown. The seller states that the high-output 6.2L LS3 V8 was built and installed in 2020. An aluminum radiator, FiTech throttle body and fuel injection system, long-tube exhaust headers, MSD ignition components, and billet accessory kit have been installed. The seller states that the engine was recently tuned, the oil was changed, and the transmission fluid was flushed. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a 4L70E and a Positraction rear end. A custom exhaust system with Flowmaster mufflers terminates before the rear axle. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
