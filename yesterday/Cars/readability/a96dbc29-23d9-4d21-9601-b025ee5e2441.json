  "text": "I miss this car a lot, and I think so does Tim since in addition to this RSX, there's five more Acura RSX Used Car of the Day articles under \"You may also be interested in.\" Flame away, but in addition to the TL of this era, I think these are the last truly excellent Acuras. Affordable (for the time), i-VTEC and 8,100 rpms, cheap to feed and run, excellent commuter car that could easily handle fun driving and then on Monday, sit on I-95 and contemplate your life. And reliable. As we see with all of these UCotDs, these have to be taken out back and shot. And a lot of these show the one weakness of this car and hit me as well (I had two of them) - the seat leather was awful. And that's minor given the fun had with this car. But by 80,000-100,000 miles, even with leather care, that driver's seat was looking pretty bad.I think Acura can still make an above average car, and the Integra shows that the lights are still on (and I might be the only one who absolutely loved the new NSX and if I had a few hundred thousand around here somewhere, would buy one), but the middle finger attitude that Honda let Acura have throughout the 1990s ended when this RSX Type-S went away.And I think he's absolutely dreaming by asking for $6,000. Given the condition, and it's almost 20 years old, if someone wants to clean it up and redo the interior, it's going to take at least half of that to do so.",
