  "description": "Ultraviolette has launched a more ergonomic version of the Mach 2. It is called the F77 Super Street and is available in two variants at ex-showroom prices of Rs 2.99 lakh and Rs 3.99 lakh. Here is everything you need to know about this new model. The Super Street’s price is the same as that of the F77 Mach 2 It has improved ergonomics, including a wider and taller handlebar Ultraviolette F77 Super Street: what is it? Under the skin, the Super Street is effectively an F77 Mach 2 with improvements to the overall ergonomics. The Super Street has an all-new handlebar that’s wider and taller than the Mach 2. However, the footpeg position is unchanged. Ultraviolette has also tweaked the headlight design, giving it a new cowl. The company claims this new design is 15 percent more aerodynamic than the F77 Mach 2 and that the redesigning has led to a change in the angle for the 5-inch TFT, which now improves overall visibility.  Otherwise, the overall design is the same as the Mach 2. At 207kg, the weight is mostly unchanged, and the company says the new handlebar has increased the overall weight by roughly 0.5kg.  The F77 Super Street is equipped with three riding modes, three levels of traction control, 10 levels of regen, hill-hold assist, three ABS modes and an optional tyre pressure monitoring system. The model is available in two variants, and the range-topping F77 Super Street Recon has a 10.3kWh battery and produces 40.2hp and 100Nm. The company claims that the range is similar to the Mach 2: the IDC range is 211km for the base variant and 323km for the Recon.  Bookings for the F77 Super Street open on February 1, and deliveries will commence by March 1.
