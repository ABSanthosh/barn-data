  "description": "South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Group recently revealed that it has collaborated with Google to deliver next-gen navigation and infotainment experiences in its new vehicles. Additionally, sister brands Kia and Genesis will also benefit from the partnership, with drivers getting access to information about 250 million locations globally. Google makes over 100 million updates to Maps each day Partnership seeks to enhance the Group’s software edge Development of software-defined vehicles (SDVs) to be sped up Notably, the announcement came before Hyundai’s shift to the Android Automotive Operating System (AAOS) for infotainment duties in 2026. Google OS designed for cars differs from Android Auto, as the latter just mirrors a phone’s screen on the infotainment system. This shift, part of the collaboration, will help Hyundai secure an innovative edge in the software-defined vehicle (SDV) technology space. AAOS-run infotainment systems are currently used in Honda, Renault, Ford and Volvo cars. Chang Song, president and head of Hyundai Motor Group’s Advanced Vehicle Platform (AVP) Division said, “Hyundai Motor Group is developing technologies in the field of SDV and mobility to provide customer-centered values. Our partnership with Google will serve as an opportunity for us to broaden our coverage of technology in the mobility market and providing greater values to customers.” Instead of directly applying Google Maps service to its cars, Hyundai aims to increase navigation accuracy by blending Maps’ Platform Places API (Application Programming Interface) and providing the latest data about locations, including business hours, contact information, ratings, reviews and more, reported a South Korean news outlet. Speaking on the collaboration, Jorgen Behrens, vice president and general manager of Google Maps Automotive said, “Every day, we make over 100 million updates in Google Maps to help people find fresh and comprehensive information about where to go and how to get there. By integrating our extensive database of places into Hyundai Motor Group vehicles through the Places API, we’re empowering drivers with the knowledge they need to navigate confidently, and we look forward to working with Hyundai Motor Group to bring more innovation to the fleet in the future.” Also See: Hyundai India to have 50 fast charging stations by end of the year Maharashtra enforces high-security plates for pre-2019 vehicles",
