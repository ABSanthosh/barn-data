  "description": "This 2019 Porsche 911 GT3 RS was optioned with the Weissach Package, which reduces weight by utilizing a carbon-composite roof panel, front lid, anti-roll bars, and interior trim, and it was initially delivered to Porsche West Broward in Davie, Florida. Now indicating 12k miles, the car is finished in Chalk over black leather and Alcantara with GT Silver stitching. Power is provided by a 4.0-liter flat-six paired with a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle, and features include the Chrono Package, an extended-range fuel tank, a front-axle lift system, LED headlights, a rear wing, a back-up camera, satin black 20\" center-lock alloy wheels, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, four-way-adjustable sport seats, Racing Yellow seat belts, and Porsche Communication Management (PCM) with navigation. The car was purchased by the seller in 2021, and it has been modified with a harness bar, Schroth Racing harnesses, Dundon Motorsports tuned-length exhaust headers with integrated catalysts, and a valved side-outlet-delete exhaust system. This 991.2 GT3 RS Weissach is offered with a window sticker, factory literature, service records, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean Minnesota title in the seller's name.",

Now indicating 12k miles, the car is finished in Chalk over black leather and Alcantara with GT Silver stitching. Power is provided by a 4.0-liter flat-six paired with a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle, and features include the Chrono Package, an extended-range fuel tank, a front-axle lift system, LED headlights, a rear wing, a back-up camera, satin black 20″ center-lock alloy wheels, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, four-way-adjustable sport seats, Racing Yellow seat belts, and Porsche Communication Management (PCM) with navigation. The car was purchased by the seller in 2021, and it has been modified with a harness bar, Schroth Racing harnesses, Dundon Motorsports tuned-length exhaust headers with integrated catalysts, and a valved side-outlet-delete exhaust system. This 991.2 GT3 RS Weissach is offered with a window sticker, factory literature, service records, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean Minnesota title in the seller’s name. The GT3 RS features lightweight glass, vented front fenders, and a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) front trunk lid and raised rear wing, and Weissach Package-equipped cars are denoted by the exposed carbon-fiber weave on these panels as well as a CFRP roof panel and carbon-fiber Sport Design mirror housings. This example is finished in Chalk and additional equipment includes a rearview camera, LED taillights, and LED headlights with Porsche Dynamic Lighting System (PDLS). Satin black-finished 20″ center-lock alloy wheels are wrapped in 265/35 front and 325/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 N2 tires. Braking is handled by yellow Porsche-branded calipers over ceramic-composite rotors. The car is equipped with a front-axle lift system, and the Weissach Package added carbon-fiber front and rear anti-roll bars and coupling rods. The seller reports that the car’s alignment has been adjusted for track driving. The four-way-adjustable sport seats are trimmed in Black leather and Alcantara with GT Silver stitching and Weissach RS embroidery on the headrests, and the car was optioned with Racing Yellow seat belts. Schroth Racing harnesses are attached to the aftermarket harness bar, which the seller tells us was color-matched to titanium-finished Weissach trim components. Additional appointments include dual-zone automatic climate control, cruise control, carbon-fiber door sill guards and window triangle trim, and Porsche Communication Management with navigation. The three-spoke steering wheel is mounted on a leather-cased column and frames a central GT3 RS-branded tachometer as well as a 225-mph speedometer, an LCD screen, and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The optional Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard along with preparation for a lap trigger device. The digital odometer indicates 12k miles, approximately 8k of which were added under current ownership. The 4.0-liter flat-six was factory rated at 520 horsepower and 346 lb-ft of torque. The car was optioned with an extended-range 23.7-gallon fuel tank. An oil change was carried out in April 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle with Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus. The seller notes that the car has been fitted with Dundon Motorsports tuned-length headers with integrated catalysts as well as a valved side-outlet-delete exhaust system. The included window sticker displays initial delivery to Porsche West Broward in Davie, Florida, and it lists factory colors and equipment along with a total price of $235,320. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage and displays at least one open Manufacturer Voluntary Service Action. There is currently a lien out on the car, and the seller’s lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the new owner. You are not connected to real-time updates.
