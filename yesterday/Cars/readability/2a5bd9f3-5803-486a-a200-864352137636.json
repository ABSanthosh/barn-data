The car was brought back to the US in 2020, and work since 2024 consisted of overhauling the carburetors and replacing the battery and starter. This 356B roadster is offered by the selling dealer as part of the DriverSource 2025 Spring Motoring Collection with a copy of the Kardex, a tool kit, the owner’s manual, recent service records, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The T5 body was introduced for the 1960 model year with revised front-end styling, including raised bumpers and headlights along with a redesigned front trunk lid handle. This Drauz-bodied single-grille roadster was finished from the factory in Silver Metallic and was repainted in 2019. The car is equipped with a brown soft top. Blemishes are pointed out by the seller in the gallery. Chrome-finished 15″ steel wheels wear 165-width Pirelli Cinturato tires that show date codes from 2020, and a matching spare wheel wrapped in a Firestone F-560 tire is stored in the front trunk compartment. Koni shocks are fitted, and stopping power is provided by four-wheel finned drum brakes. The front bucket seats and rear jump seats have been reupholstered in light brown leather, and interior appointments include lap belts, squareweave carpets, and a body-color painted dashboard. The three-spoke steering wheel frames green-letter VDO instrumentation including a 120-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline as well as a combination gauge for oil temperature and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 40k miles. The 1.6-liter flat-four features dual carburetors that were overhauled in 2024. A replacement battery and starter were installed in 2025. Compression test results are viewable in the gallery. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle. A composite photo showing chassis, body, engine, and gearbox numbers around the car has been provided by the selling dealer. Engine stamping *801241* can be seen above, and a corresponding number is listed on the Kardex. A copy of the Kardex is viewable above and lists the factory colors and serial numbers.
