Equipment includes a Pride titanium cat-back exhaust system, adjustable Fortune Auto coilovers, a StopTech Trophy front big brake kit, staggered Titan7 forged alloy wheels, pop-up headlights, a black roof panel, a carbon-fiber rear wing, power-adjustable seats, automatic climate control, a carbon-fiber headliner, and Alpine touchscreen infotainment linked to a custom sound system. A timing belt service was completed in 2021 along with replacing various seals, gaskets, and hoses. This NSX shows 67k miles and is offered with service records, spare parts, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The NSX featured aluminum bodywork, and this example is finished in Formula Red with a black roof panel and pillars. Features include pop-up headlights, power-adjustable side mirrors, carbon-fiber side air intake ducts, a carbon-fiber NSX-R-style elevated rear wing, and JDM Honda badging. Bronze-finished 17″ front and 18″ rear Titan7 T-55 forged wheels are mounted with Dunlop Direzza ZIII tires. The four-wheel double-wishbone suspension is lowered on adjustable Fortune Auto coilovers and features a Comptech rear strut tower brace and factory front and rear sway bars. Braking is handled by a front StopTech Trophy big brake kit and factory rear calipers over slotted rotors. The rear rotors and pads were replaced in 2021. The power-adjustable sport seats are upholstered in black leather with red inserts. The stainless-steel door sill plates are stamped with the car’s serial number. Carbon-fiber trim accents the center console, and additional appointments include automatic climate control, cruise control, power windows, an NSX-R-style shift knob, a carbon-fiber headliner, and an Alpine touchscreen infotainment system linked to a custom sound system featuring a subwoofer mounted in the passenger footwell. The leather-wrapped Personal steering wheel frames a Sjoeberg Design id4 digital instrument cluster with a 9k-rpm tachometer and readouts for speed, voltage, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer shows 67k miles, approximately 3k of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 3.0-liter V6 features VTEC variable valve timing and is modified with a Comptech supercharger and a Pride titanium cat-back exhaust system. Work since 2021 consisted of replacing the following components: Front crankshaft seal Cylinder head gaskets Timing belt and tensioner Camshaft seals Oil pan gasket Valve cover gaskets Thermostat Coolant reservoir Coolant hoses Battery Air filter Power is routed to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential.
