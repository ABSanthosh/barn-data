  "text": "Nissan, Toyota, Subaru, and Lexus all secured at least one spot 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Consumer Reports has revealed their top ten automotive picks of 2025. Toyota nabbed three spots for the Camry, Highlander Hybrid, and RAV4 PHEV. The only American brands to make the list were Ford and Tesla. Consumer Reports has revealed their annual Top 10 Automotive Picks for 2025 and Japanese automakers have once again dominated the rankings. However, two Americans and a German made it into the mix. Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, the publication said each Top Pick had a high overall score, which factors in road tests as well as reliability and owner satisfaction ratings. Top Picks also had to perform well in crash tests and each comes standard with automatic emergency braking. In essence, these models are supposed to be safe, reliable, and good to drive. More: Rivian And Cadillac Hit Rock Bottom In Consumer Reports’ Reliability Rankings With that primer out of the way, Subaru picked up accolades for having the best compact and subcompact SUVs. The Crosstrek was praised for having standard all-wheel drive, good fuel efficiency, and an excellent ride. Likewise, Consumer Reports said the 2025 Forester is “better than ever” as the redesigned model provides a “noticeably quieter cabin and more cargo space than the previous model.” The Toyota RAV4 PHEV was named the best fuel-efficient SUV, while the Highlander Hybrid took home top honors in the midsize segment. The latter was described as a “unicorn” as it provides three-rows of seats, despite having fuel economy numbers that rival much smaller crossovers. CR TOP PICKS The Lexus NX was dubbed the best compact luxury SUV, while the BMW X5 was the best midsize luxury crossover. The latter was praised as a “well-rounded vehicle” that has a “richly finished cabin” as well as power and efficiency. Putting SUVs aside, the Nissan Sentra was deemed an “exceptional value” thanks to its standard safety equipment as well as an affordable $21,590 price tag. The 2025 Toyota Camry was praised for being comfortable, practical, and able to return 48 mpg in testing thanks to its standard hybrid powertrain. Last but not least, the Ford Maverick won over Consumer Reports thanks to its fuel-efficient hybrid powertrain and refined ride for a truck. Lastly, the Tesla Model Y was credited with having “otherworldly” acceleration as well as a “substantial driving range.”",
