  "description": "The RV BlazeX is Revolt’s latest electric commuter, positioned as an alternative to 125cc motorcycles. Sitting between the RV 400 BRZ and RV 400 models, the RV BlazeX emphasizes practicality and daily usability. However, our test was confined to a go-kart track, limiting our overall riding experience. Revolt RV BlazeX design and features Sporting a minimalist aesthetic, the RV BlazeX adopts design elements from the RV1 and RV1+. Unlike the RV 400 and RV 400 BRZ, this model follows a traditional commuter style, featuring a round LED headlamp, LED indicators, and a long single-piece seat. While fit and finish are adequate for the segment, the wiring around the handlebar and the charging socket cover could benefit from better quality materials. The charging cover, in particular, feels flimsy and might not withstand much force. The switchgear quality also seems budget-oriented, with buttons feeling soft and less tactile. A new kill switch is now present, but the absence of a traditional start button may require new riders to be extra cautious when getting on the bike because it is ready to go when you turn the key on. While the overall design mirrors Revolt's lower-tier models, the most noticeable addition is the 6-inch LCD display. This unit allows riders to switch between three modes (Eco, City, and Sport), offers Bluetooth connectivity, and supports app-based features like geo-fencing and over-the-air updates. Two buttons beside the screen enable toggling through trip meters, but they require a firm press, making operation less seamless. Our test unit came with an accessory windscreen, wheel stickering, and a crash guard. While the pricing for these extras was not disclosed, Revolt states that more accessories are available in addition to these three. Revolt RV BlazeX charging and practicality Reinforcing its commuter focus, the RV BlazeX offers a well-cushioned seat and an accessible 790mm seat height. Revolt has also upgraded the suspension to support a higher payload of 250kg. Additional storage is available under the tank, which also acts as a cover for the removable battery. Riders have the flexibility to remove and charge the battery at home. However, the 3.24kWh battery weighs 20kg, which could be cumbersome for those living in buildings without an elevator. The standard charger replenishes the battery from 0-80% in 3 hours and 30 minutes, while an optional fast charger reduces this time to 1 hour and 20 minutes. If purchased separately, the fast charger costs Rs 14,500, but buying it with the bike allows for a trade-in against the standard charger, reducing the price to Rs 4,500. Revolt RV BlazeX performance and handling The RV BlazeX is powered by a new electric motor, delivering a peak output of 4.1kW and 45Nm (at the motor) and 180Nm (at the wheel). Revolt claims a top speed of 85kph, matching its flagship model. While these figures may seem modest, the BlazeX provides a surprising level of punch, especially in Sport mode, making it engaging on the tight go-kart track. However, the throttle response is inconsistent, sometimes feeling imprecise or sluggish. This raises concerns about real-world traffic performance, where smooth throttle control is essential. The suspension setup includes a telescopic front fork and twin rear shock absorbers. Though the track had minimal bumps, the few encountered were absorbed well, ensuring a comfortable ride. The softer suspension setup makes it better suited for city roads rather than track use. Braking performance is strong, with 240mm disc brakes at both ends working effectively, assisted by the CBS (Combined Braking System) for added stability. Revolt RV BlazeX verdict The Revolt RV BlazeX blends  performance, range, and modern features at a competitive price. Its commuter-friendly design and smart connectivity features make it an attractive choice for those transitioning to electric mobility.  However, certain aspects, such as the finish quality and throttle calibration, leave room for refinement in an otherwise practical package.
