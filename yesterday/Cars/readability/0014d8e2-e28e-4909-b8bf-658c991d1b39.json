  "description": "TVS has launched the updated Apache RTR 310, with prices starting at Rs 2.40 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi) and crossing the Rs 3 lakh mark for a fully loaded bike. With this update, TVS has added some new features to the Apache RTR 310 while retaining the mechanicals. Apache RTR 310 becomes the first made-in-India bike with keyless ignition Engine and gearing have seen some changes Fully loaded RTR 310 costs above Rs 3 lakh  TVS Apache RTR 310: what’s new for 2025? Clear clutch cover, keyless ignition, launch control, and more on the RTR 310 The Apache RTR 310’s motor continues to make 35.6hp and 28.7Nm as before, but TVS has calibrated it to consider the level of throttle input given by the rider as well as the gear you’re in to tune its responsiveness, and the effort was to make it precise and linear without reducing its punch.  The rest of the key specifications of the bike remain unchanged. With this update, TVS has equipped the RTR 310 with the same rear sprocket as the RR 310 – earlier, the naked Apache 310 had a 4-tooth larger rear sprocket than the faired version. The RTR 310 now also gets Drag Torque Control, which prevents rear-wheel slip during engine braking and downshifting, working in tandem with the slip/assist clutch. Some other features that can also be optioned onto the RTR 310 with the BTO packs (more on this later) include launch control (which sets the engine speed at 7,250rpm) and keyless ignition. These features join an already well-specced suite of rider aids on the RTR 310, including cruise control, a bidirectional quickshifter, as well as switchable traction control and ABS.   In terms of visual differences, the list is much smaller. The Apache’s sharp silhouette remains unchanged – no bad thing, really – but it now gains an uber-cool transparent clutch cover, knuckle guards and sequential turn signals, all as standard equipment. A new colour, Fiery Red, joins the previously offered Arsenal black, Fury Yellow and Sepang Blue.   The base TVS Apache RTR 310 is priced at Rs 2.40 lakh and can only be had in black. Then, you step up to the Rs 2.57 lakh top variant, available in red and yellow, which brings in the bidirectional quickshifter. Do bear in mind that the base variant is very well-specced with traction control, cruise control, drag torque control and rear-wheel lift mitigation.  TVS Apache RTR 310 price and colours Beyond that, you have the option to spec the RTR 310 with a couple of BTO (Built To Order) kits. The Dynamic kit adds fully adjustable suspension at both ends, a brass-coated chain and a tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS), and is priced at Rs 18,000. The Dynamic Pro kit brings in a whole heap of electronics, such as keyless ignition, launch control, and makes all riding aids lean-sensitive. The Dynamic Pro kit is priced at Rs 28,000. This means that a fully specced Apache RTR 310 with both the Dynamic kits optioned will cost you Rs 3.03 lakh – more money than the seriously capable KTM 390 Duke (Rs 2.97 lakh). Currently, there is an introductory offer that gives you Rs 10,000 off the price of the base and top variants, although TVS hasn’t specified its end date.
