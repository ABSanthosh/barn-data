This NA Miata is now offered in New York at no reserve with the owner’s manual, a service manual, a tonneau cover, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Ohio title. The car is finished in British Racing Green and features a black convertible soft top, a body-color removable hardtop, pop-up headlights, chrome door handles, painted mirror caps, a convertible top boot, and a single exhaust outlet. The selling dealer reports the front bumper cover, right fender, and hood have been repainted, and overspray is noted on the headlight surrounds. The 14″ Daisy alloy wheels are mounted with Starfire tires. The car is equipped with an independent double wishbone suspension, power steering, front and rear stabilizer bars, and four-wheel disc brakes. The cabin features bucket seats upholstered in tan leather along with color-coordinated door panels as well as a black upper dashboard and center console. Interior amenities include a CD/cassette stereo, headrest speakers, cruise control, air conditioning, and power windows. Special Edition cars were equipped with a wood Nardi shift knob and handbrake grip along with Special Edition badging. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 140-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 21k miles. The 1.6-liter DOHC inline-four was factory rated at 116 horsepower and 100 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential.
