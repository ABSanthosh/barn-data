  "description": "Suzuki’s stalwart supermini promises tech, style and an engaging drive. Does it deliver? In the current automotive landscape, the business case for bigger cars is easier to justify than that for smaller ones, which makes vehicles like the Suzuki Swift all the more unusual. The small car sector might seem alive and well in other countries, but in the UK, many of the little Suzuki's conventional rivals have been consigned to the history books. There's no longer a Ford Fiesta or a proper Mazda 2, and who remembers the Nissan Micra?It's not all bad news, though, because there are a few survivors, like the Hyundai i10, Volkswagen Polo, Renault Clio and Skoda Fabia, alongside a few EV alternatives like the Hyundai Inster and Renault 5. It helps, then, that the Swift is a car that we would recommend to buyers in such a market. Read on to find out why...The Suzuki Swift range at a glanceAll Swifts come generously equipped as standard. Entry-level Motion models get heated front seats, keyless entry, a rear-view camera, 16in alloy wheels and a 9.0in infotainment touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Step up to Ultra trim and you get automatic air conditioning, 16in alloys with a polished finish, rear-seat air vents and electrically folding mirrors.Prices start from just over £19,000 and rise to just over £20,000 for top-spec models.There's only one engine available: a 1.2-litre naturally aspirated petrol triple with mild-hybrid assistance. It's only as powerful as the non-electrified unit in its predecessor, but it's faster to 62mph and Suzuki claims it’s around 7% more fuel efficient. Cars fitted with the standard five-speed manual gearbox get from 0-62mph in 12.5sec and have a top speed of 103mph, while those fitted with the CVT automatic are a little faster, at 11.9sec to 62mph and 106mph at the top end.Suzuki’s Allgrip four-wheel drive system, like the one you used to find on the Ignis, is available with the manual only. It adds 25mm to the ground clearance and overall height.Suspension is by MacPherson struts at the front and a torsion beam at the rear. The brakes are ventilated discs at the front and drums at the rear.",

  "text": "Inside, you can feel where weight has been saved. The Swift has a nice enough interior but one made largely from harder and scratchier materials than the equivalent Polo. Crucially, though, the way in which the dashboard has been presented is attractive to behold, with a sweeping, layered look, cream colouring and soft pads on the doors. It helps, too, that the switches you touch often, like the brushed-look climate controls, are pleasingly finished and feel built to last. There’s a good amount of ergonomic soundness to it, too: the controls for the lights (including the foglight) sit on the left stalk, those for the wiper sensitivity on the right and there are separate climate buttons and a soft-feel old-school handbrake.There's also a touchscreen, of course, and its graphics aren't nearly as well resolved as those in the Polo, but at least you don’t need it for major driving controls or safety functions. During our time with it, we saw no software glitches and the Bluetooth maintained a stable connection.The lane-keeping assistance can be toggled by a button on the dash, but the speed-limit assistant (which is obliged to default to on) can be toggled only via a steering-wheel button and a trip computer stalk while the car is stationary.This is a cumbersome process that you will likely tire of quite quickly, not least because there are button blanks on the dashboard and steering wheel that could do the job, and if you have to be stationary, that negates the advantage of avoiding putting it on a touchscreen. We can't fault the amount of space inside, however, with ample front head room and a forward-pushed windscreen such a stretch from the driver that you feel set a long way back in the car.There’s enough head and leg room in the rear, too, and passengers over 6ft will be able to fit in. It's relatively narrow but plenty comfortable enough for four (although it can seat five if need be).The boot is from 265 litres with the rear seats down, which is almost 100 litres smaller than the Polo's but 13 litres larger than the i10's. With both seats folded down, space increases up to 980 litres. It has a helpfully deep floor, loosely carpeted rather than solidly based, with space for an optional spare wheel beneath it.",
