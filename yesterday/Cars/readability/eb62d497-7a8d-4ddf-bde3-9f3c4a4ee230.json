  "description": "Mahindra has been introducing new mass-market SUVs every few months, giving customers a lot of choices. But, this also leads to the piling up of unsold units of outgoing models. Case in point, the XUV 3XO replaced the XUV300 earlier this year and has been doing quite well in terms of sales. However, some dealers we spoke to have a few leftover units of the XUV300. Similarly, unsold stocks from model year 2023 or early 2024 of some other models such as the Bolero, Bolero Neo, XUV700, and the Scorpio N are also being sold with huge discounts this festive season. Mahindra XUV300 Save up to Rs 1.8 lakh The XUV300 has been a decent rival to the Brezza and the Nexon; however, it was marred by its dated looks and lack of cargo space. It came with an acceptable feature list, a refined 1.5-litre diesel engine, and two turbo petrol options. The SUV was not manufactured in MY2024 and was replaced by the XUV 3XO. Unsold XUV300 units are being sold at discounts of up to Rs 1.8 lakh at some outlets that have inventory. There aren’t many units left, which means customers won’t have much choice in selecting their color, variant, or engine option. Mahindra XUV400 Save up to Rs 4.4 lakh The slow-selling XUV400 EV has been available with discounts of over Rs 2 lakh for almost a year now. There are still some units left, most likely from the MY2023 production batches, which are being offered with discounts of up to a whopping Rs 4.4 lakh. Mahindra XUV700 Save up to Rs 1.8 lakh The XUV700 has seen multiple price cuts and feature rejigs this year. While most MY2023 models have been sold, some unsold units are still available with discounts of up to Rs 1.8 lakh, depending on inventory. The comparatively newer MY2024 stock is being offered with discounts of around Rs 40,000. Mahindra Bolero, Bolero Neo Save up to Rs 1.35 lakh The original Bolero has been a steady seller for the brand and is now available at discounts of around Rs 1 lakh on unsold MY2023 stock. The newer MY2024 inventory gets around 35,000 off. The Bolero Neo, on the other hand, is available with discounts of around Rs 1.35 lakh on unsold MY2023 stock. Mahindra Scorpio Classic Save up to Rs 1.2 lakh The Scorpio Classic has its own fan base. Heavily updated after the launch of the Scorpio N, it even comes with 4WD in some variants. Discounts in the range of Rs 1.2 lakh are being offered on older stock, mostly on the MY2023 units of the capable Mahindra SUV. Mahindra Scorpio N Save up to Rs 1 lakh Sales of the popular Scorpio N have plateaued at the moment, and some buyers are now opting for the new Thar Roxx instead. The Scorpio N ticks the boxes for refined engine options, manual and automatic transmission choices, multiple seating configurations, and 4WD hardware in some variants. Discounts of around Rs 1 lakh are available on the SUV this Diwali. Mahindra Thar discounts: Diwali 2024 As buyers await deliveries of the Thar Roxx, the Thar 3-door is now being offered with discounts of up to Rs 1.6 lakh.
