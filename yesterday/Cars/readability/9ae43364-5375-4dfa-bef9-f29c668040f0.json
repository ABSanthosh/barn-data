Powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 that drives all four wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission, the car was optioned with an Active M differential, an M Sport exhaust system, gold-finished 20″ Style 789M forged alloy wheels, ceramic-composite brakes, a carbon-fiber roof, adaptive LED headlights, Park Distance Control, heated power-adjustable M Carbon front bucket seats, a head-up display, a Harman Kardon sound system, four-zone automatic climate control, and iDrive infotainment with navigation. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2025, this F90 is now offered in Colorado with the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Tennessee title. The M5 CS debuted for the 2022 model year, and this example is finished in Brands Hatch Gray Metallic with bronze accents on the front kidney grilles, fender trim, and badges. Carbon-fiber exterior elements include the roof panel, front splitter, rear spoiler, rear diffuser, and mirror covers. Additional details include front and rear Park Distance Control, quad exhaust outlets, and Icon Adaptive LED headlights with Laserlight. Gold-finished 20″ Style 789M forged alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires. The CS features a quicker steering ratio, revised Dynamic Damper Control tuning, shorter and stiffer springs, stiffer damping rates, and thicker toe-link ball joints and stabilizer bars when compared to the standard M5. Stopping power is handled by cross-drilled and ventilated M ceramic-composite brakes. The power-adjustable and heated M Carbon front seats are trimmed in black Merino leather and Alcantara with Mugello Red accents and illuminated M5 badges below the headrests, while Aluminum Dark Carbon Structure trim accents the dashboard, center console, and door panels. Appointments include rear bucket seats, a head-up display, a Harman Kardon sound system, Driving Assistant, Comfort Access keyless entry, Gesture Control, Lane Departure Warning, Active Blind Spot Detection, Frontal Collision Warning, cruise control, four-zone automatic climate control, and iDrive infotainment with navigation. The Alcantara-wrapped M steering wheel features carbon-fiber shift paddles and frames a 12.3″ configurable Live Cockpit Pro TFT Instrument Cluster. The digital odometer indicates 118 miles. The twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 was factory rated at 627 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to all four wheels through an M Steptronic eight-speed automatic transmission and an Active M differential. Power can be directed exclusively to the rear wheels via driver cockpit settings. The car is equipped with an M Sport exhaust system. An oil change was performed in April 2025.
