  "description": "Some motorcycles have a tendency to slip under the average buyer’s radar, and the Suzuki GSX-8R is a fine example. It probably won’t be the first pick when you ask someone to think of a middleweight sportbike, and that’s fair because this bike packs a parallel-twin engine in a segment with more powerful inline-3 and 4-cylinder motors. But unassuming things can often surprise you with how good they can be, and that’s exactly what the 8R did at our annual track day a couple of months back. Not only did it set the quickest lap time (to be fair, it was also the most powerful bike there), but it also proved to be surprisingly sweet and engaging to ride. Suzuki GSX8R engine sound and performance - 8/10 Twin-cyl motor is torquey and smooth but isn't the most exciting nor the best sounding in its class As it turns out, this character translates beautifully to the street as well. While the 776cc parallel twin produces the least power in this segment, the torque figure is actually the highest. Its 78Nm is, in fact, much closer to the Triumph Street Triple 765 RS than it is to the Daytona 660, which is this bike’s immediate rival. That results in a wonderfully strong pull from as low as 3,000rpm, and effortless performance is the name of the game.   The 776cc parallel twin is a good engine, but it lacks the sound and top-end excitement you’ll find with rivals that have 3- or 4-cylinder motors. Switching between the three riding modes lets you experience a very mellow throttle response in C mode or a sharp, quick-throttle feel in A mode, where the torque hit arrives with a solid kick. I found that B mode offers a nice middle ground between the two, but regardless of which you choose, the 8R will propel you to triple-digit speeds with complete ease and no need for dramatic high revs.  That’s not to say that this is a slow motorcycle, and with 82hp, it will blast past 150kph the way most quick Indian bikes would get to 100. But there’s also no discounting the fact that it has sacrificed some of the exciting, zingy top-end performance of its multi-cylinder rivals in exchange for the low-end usability. However, the bigger loss for many enthusiasts will be the sound or relative lack of it. It doesn't sound as nice nor has the same top-end rush as its multi-cylindered rivals. This is a 270-degree parallel twin, and it does have that typically deep and rumbling sound, but it’s also quite muted and not very exciting. For reference, Aprilia’s new 457 parallel twin sounds a lot louder and more thrilling, as we discovered when the Suzuki and the Tuono 457 were parked side by side on our track day. If you’re someone who wants a loud and flashy sportbike, this won’t be for you. EngineSuzuki GSX-8REngine776cc, twin-cylinder, liquid-cooledPower82hp at 8500rpm Torque78Nm at 6800rpmGearbox 6-speed Suzuki GSX8R ride and handling - 8/10  It is poised when going through a corner yet comfortable over broken roads But a subtle nature doesn’t mean an unimpressive one because this bike is surprisingly good fun to ride. On the track, it proved to be easy, unintimidating and thoroughly well-behaved, responding obediently to your every request. This clearly isn’t a bike made for the racetrack, but it performed there far better than most would expect. The only limiting factors for Rajini when he was pushing for a fast lap were that the footpegs were scraping and that the ABS was too intrusive. Comfort is aided by a wide and accommodating rider seat. On the street, neither of those ended up being an issue, but the bike retained that sweet and friendly feel. At 205kg, the 8R is in the ballpark for the segment, and you will feel the weight if you plan to go attacking some very tight and twisty interior roads. But give the bike some breathing room on a wider road, and you’ll discover a rewarding handler that settles into a wonderful flow with the road.  Tall clip-on bars result in a reasonably comfy riding position. The 8R feels settled on its suspension and encourages you to push to quite a high pace. Part of this deep-seated sense of confidence comes through the tubular steel chassis and the non-adjustable but well-set Showa suspension. It’s not excessively plush like the Daytona 660, which means it isn’t as comfy on badly made concrete roads (although it really isn’t bad and is far from punishing), but you reap the rewards when the pace is raised on a good stretch of tarmac.  Key SpecsSuzuki GSX-8RKerb Weight205kgSeat Height810mmFuel Capacity14 litresGround Clearance145mmWheelbase1465mm Suzuki GSX8R comfort, build quality and features - 8/10 Well-built, comfortable and has everything you need, can drink fuel quite quickly if you ride it hard   On the other hand, the riding position is committed enough to remind you that you’re on a fair, sporty motorcycle but also relatively kind on the wrists, hips and knees. It’s a similar story with the brakes. The initial bite is almost disappointing, but once you start using them for a while, you realise there’s sufficient power and feel, and it matches the nature of the bike. Brakes feel dull at first but work well. I also like how Suzuki has given its 5-inch TFT display a simple, easy-to-use layout. You almost never have to enter any menus. All the functions you’d need, like changing the ride modes, the TC levels (four, including off), or just switching between trip information, can be done from the main home screen display. Overall quality levels are also very nice, and like most imported Japanese bikes, everything feels solid and has a pleasing, built-to-last feel. TFT display has a clean layout and is very easy to use. There aren’t many outright negatives, and the few complaints are that the bike gets quite hot in heavy traffic – there are no nasty hot air blasts, but there is quite a bit of radiated heat that you need to deal with. What I found to be more of an issue was that it seems to empty its 14-litre tank quite quickly, and you won’t go much further than 150-170km on a tankful if you have a throttle-happy right wrist.   A subtle nature doesn’t mean an unimpressive one, and the 8R is surprisingly good fun. Suzuki GSX8R price and verdict - 8/10 It is the most affordable and least flashy machine in its class At Rs 9.25 lakh, ex-showroom, the GSX-8R costs about Rs 50,000 less than the Daytona and Rs 75,000 less than Honda’s revered CBR650R. The price savings are nice but not big enough to be a reason to pick this bike over those two. For that, I’d say that this is the thinking person’s middleweight sportbike – the bike for someone who likes flying under the radar.  The 8R is a lovely but understated machine, which won't make it stand out in its class. And with that in mind, Suzuki may have a bit of a tough time on their hands. That’s because this is the segment where someone is typically buying their first sportbike, and subtlety is usually not at the top of the wish list. But for those who want that more understated experience, the GSX-8R is a great choice.  Also See: Suzuki GSX8R video review",

It’s not excessively plush like the Daytona 660, which means it isn’t as comfy on badly made concrete roads (although it really isn’t bad and is far from punishing), but you reap the rewards when the pace is raised on a good stretch of tarmac. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv oncopy=\"return false\" onpaste=\"return false\" oncut=\"return false\"\u003e\u003ctable\u003e\u003cthead\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003cth colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\"\u003eKey Specs\u003c/th\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/thead\u003e\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSuzuki GSX-8R\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eKerb Weight\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Suzuki GSX-8R\"\u003e205kg\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSeat Height\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Suzuki GSX-8R\"\u003e810mm\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eFuel Capacity\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Suzuki GSX-8R\"\u003e14 litres\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eGround Clearance\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Suzuki GSX-8R\"\u003e145mm\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eWheelbase\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Suzuki GSX-8R\"\u003e1465mm\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuzuki GSX8R comfort, build quality and features - 8/10\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWell-built, comfortable and has everything you need, can drink fuel quite quickly if you ride it hard  \u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOn the other hand, the riding position is committed enough to remind you that you’re on a fair, sporty motorcycle but also relatively kind on the wrists, hips and knees. It’s a similar story with the brakes.

You almost never have to enter any menus. All the functions you’d need, like changing the ride modes, the TC levels (four, including off), or just switching between trip information, can be done from the main home screen display. Overall quality levels are also very nice, and like most imported Japanese bikes, everything feels solid and has a pleasing, built-to-last feel.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Suzuki GSX8R display.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTFT display has a clean layout and is very easy to use.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-c35c74a6-7fff-af90-dde6-18687679a91d\"\u003eThere aren’t many outright negatives, and the few complaints are that the bike gets quite hot in heavy traffic – there are no nasty hot air blasts, but there is quite a bit of radiated heat that you need to deal with. What I found to be more of an issue was that it seems to empty its 14-litre tank quite quickly, and you won’t go much further than 150-170km on a tankful if you have a throttle-happy right wrist.  \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Suzuki GSX8R side profile riding shot.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eA subtle nature doesn’t mean an unimpressive one, and the 8R is surprisingly good fun.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-c35c74a6-7fff-af90-dde6-18687679a91d\"\u003eSuzuki GSX8R price and verdict - 8/10\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt is the most affordable and least flashy machine in its class\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-c35c74a6-7fff-af90-dde6-18687679a91d\"\u003eAt Rs 9.25 lakh, ex-showroom, the GSX-8R costs about Rs 50,000 less than the Daytona and Rs 75,000 less than Honda’s revered CBR650R. The price savings are nice but not big enough to be a reason to pick this bike over those two. For that, I’d say that this is the thinking person’s middleweight sportbike – the bike for someone who likes flying under the radar. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Suzuki GSX8R rear left static shot.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe 8R is a lovely but understated machine, which won\u0026#39;t make it stand out in its class.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-c35c74a6-7fff-af90-dde6-18687679a91d\"\u003eAnd with that in mind, Suzuki may have a bit of a tough time on their hands. That’s because this is the segment where someone is typically buying their first sportbike, and subtlety is usually not at the top of the wish list.
