  "text": "Lego's partnership with Formula 1 racing now sees all 10 teams represented at the Minifig level.For the grownups, there are also highly detailed 1:8 scale sets from Technic that cost more than $200 each.Lego has also launched an online F1 portal with explainers about the racing and the teams.Formula 1 entering into a partnership with the world's largest tire manufacturer is something you expect. Not so obvious is the fact that the tiremaker in question is Lego. It's true: producing about 300 million tiny rubber wheels each year makes Lego the leader in tires. Now the toy legend is rolling out a huge number of scale-sized Formula 1 cars this year.LEGO LEGO Speed Champions Ultimate Formula 1 Collector's Pack - Contains 10 Sets in 1 - Includes Exclusive Poster - Collectible F1 Model Car Kit - Exciting Gift for Adults and Racing Enthusiasts - 66802There've been many Lego racing sets over the years, including a partnership with Ferrari that produced a scale model of the F310 F1 car back in 1998. More recently, the Speed Champions series brought everything from Mustangs to Countachs to Lego's Minifig scale, complete with steely-eyed little drivers.The new Speed Champions series of F1 cars includes scale models from all 10 teams, including the Red Bull RB20, Ferrari SF-24, Aston Martin AMR24, Mercedes-AMG W15, and even cars from Haas and Alpine. These are really fun sets for the budding F1 enthusiast, built for play rather than display, and with fun little details.LEGO LEGO Technic Ferrari SF-24 F1 Model Car Kit - Building Set for Adults, Ages 18+ with Realistic Features - Ferrari F1 DIY Craft for Display - Gift Idea for F1 Fans - 42207For the adult Lego fan, there are currently two new sets in the range at the 1:8 scale: the Ferrari SF-24 and the Red Bull RB20. Both are under Lego's Technic line and include built-in features like functional steering and suspension, working DRS, and even a two-speed gearbox. It's a display model you build yourself, marveling at how Lego's designers manage to turn little plastic bricks into a working F1 power unit with moving pistons.Also worth a mention, though not part of the new release, are the two Icons display sets featuring Ayrton Senna's MP4/4 and Nigel Mansell's Williams FW14B. Look! Little Lego minifig Mansell moustache! Gotta have that for the bookshelf.Beyond the sets, Lego will also be present at 13 races throughout this year's calendar, offering young fans the chance to build at the track. There's also a virtual component, where kids can log on to practice their own racing skills or learn about the F1 teams through the eyes of Lego world. It's kind of like Lego Star Wars, but for Formula 1.This partnership leverages two of the most well-known brands on the planet, and grows both of them. Lego gets to appeal to F1 fans both young and old, and F1 gets to open even more access to fans who might be new to the sport. There are more sets coming in the pipeline, but right now, if you want to play out this season's racing between Red Bull, McLaren, and Ferrari at the Minifig level on your desk, it's just a couple of clicks away.Brendan McAleer is a freelance writer and photographer based in North Vancouver, B.C., Canada.
