  "text": "Jun 11, 2025 6:01 PM EDTWhy the XM Label Is Now BMW’s Only XM Trim for 2026 The XM was announced as the first car exclusively developed by the famed BMW M division, and as such, it was given more power than any road car ever made in Munich, but it also had an identity crisis. On the one hand, 738 horsepower was more than enough for a halo car in the BMW lineup, but on the other, the availability of lesser trims diluted the impact of the badge. It was like offering a BMW M3 trim with two-thirds of the power alongside the real deal. But BMW is learning from its ultra-luxury rivals like the Lamborghini Urus and Aston Martin DBX. For 2026, the XM is only available in range-topping Label form, and it should be better than ever. Finally, BMW M’s standalone M car stands alone. New Exterior and Interior Options for the 2026 XM When human beings start something new, many will change their hairstyle, wardrobe, and shoes to signify their evolution, and the same applies to an improved XM. The new wardrobe includes optional BMW Individual Frozen Tanzanite Blue metallic paint and 23-inch Style 1096 M wheels in a new Jet Black finish, which we think improves the design immensely and removes visual weight over 2025’s silver wheels. BMW has also given the vehicle a new welcome light animation when the car is unlocked, and inside, three new BMW Individual interior schemes are available: Night Blue Full Merino Leather with Vintage Coffee accents, Black Full Merino Leather with Vintage Coffee accents, and Silverstone Extended Merino Leather with Black accents. The 2025 XM was available with color schemes that a colorblind enthusiast of 1970s interior home decor might appreciate, but that’s now been fixed, with the rear seat comfort cushions matching the color of the seat surface as standard for all Individual Merino Leather upholstery options. The rooflining is still a magical place to look, though, with a prismatic ambient lighting design giving the feel of a high-end nightclub. Same Powerful Plug-In Hybrid, Now With Faster Charging The hybridized twin-turbo V8 still develops 738 hp and 738 lb-ft of torque, enabling 0-60 mph in just 3.6 seconds and a top speed of 155 mph (175 mph with the option M Driver’s Package). That’s plenty for a BMW of any description. Although the 2025 Urus SE, which is also a plug-in hybrid, delivers 789 ponies, the new DBX S only tops out at 717 ponies, so the XM is in the mix. Looking deeper beneath the skin, BMW hasn’t mentioned any changes to the stiff suspension; the one thing BMW has fiddled with for 2026 won’t be evident from behind the wheel: the charging unit now enables AC recharging at speeds of up to 11 kW (up from 7.4 kW for 2025). Official Debut and Release Timing The new XM Label will be publicly unveiled on Saturday, June 14, at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, where the BMW M Hybrid V8 WEC racecar will be competing. Pricing for the 2026 XM will follow closer to the start of production, which is scheduled for August at BMW’s Plant Spartanburg in South Carolina. With BMW resorting to heavy discounts to try to sell the existing XM, it remains to be seen how these changes will affect the SUV’s popularity, but the decision to choose a single path to follow should be a step in the right direction. Is it now worthy of being the first standalone M car since the iconic M1? Perhaps that’s a discussion for after we’ve driven it… About the AuthorSebastian Cenizo",
