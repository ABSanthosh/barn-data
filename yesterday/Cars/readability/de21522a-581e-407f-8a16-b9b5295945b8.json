  "description": "The Skoda Slavia, in its Monte Carlo trim, has really been turning heads. Not because it’s new, but I guess in a jam full of SUVs, a sedan wearing bright red is quite the attention-grabber. Walking up to it makes me happy the moment I see it parked there, knowing that the 1.5 TSI engine will be a delight to drive. Oh, and on a side note, I just realised ‘jam’ would be an apt collective noun for a group of cars. The storage space under the front armrest is nice and deep. So far, I’ve used the Slavia only within the city, but with summer vacations on and traffic appreciably lighter, I’ve actually been able to enjoy clear roads, steady cruising, and decent fuel efficiency, too. I’ve managed an overall figure of about 8.5kpl over this past month – not bad for a petrol automatic in Mumbai, and I haven’t been driving with efficiency in mind. You can only have a dial display of the speedo or tacho, not both together. Rather, it’s been tempting to enjoy the 150hp and 250Nm of torque, which makes it responsive off the line and also allows you to take advantage of empty stretches of tarmac. It’s amazing how quickly you’ll be nudging the 70kph speed limit around town. Beyond outright speed, though, it’s the crisp nature of its power delivery that you will enjoy every time you dab the throttle, so don’t think of this as something you can only enjoy out on highways. Have to say, though, at very low speeds, it sometimes trips up between 1st and 2nd gear, typical of so many DSGs. Indented shelf cubby neatly creates two separate handy storage spaces. Another bit that annoys me – even though it’s a far smaller issue – is the instrument display. It’s customisable and has dials, but you can only call up a speedo or a tacho dial, not both at the same time. And while I’m on about stuff I don’t like, let’s talk air conditioning. The VW Group’s India 2.0 cars were known to have subpar ACs, and while this one is just about holding up against the summer, every now and then, you will need to tweak the temperature or fan speed, and those touch controls are fiddly to use. The indentation does help, but it’s hard to get a precise change in temperature or fan speed, and you need to look down to confirm just how much has changed. Console slot should have been deeper to easily store the key fob. Such a contrast to the steering-mounted audio controls. The track selection buttons fall into hand easily, and the volume scroll wheel is simply a delight to use: quick, easy, and with a nice tactile feel as well. It’s a familiar Skoda, and it’s nice to see these on the India 2.0 cars too. Speaking of familiar Skoda traits, there’s a ‘simply clever’ bit I really like and put to use every day; the centre console cubby has an indented shelf design that creates two spaces within and neatly holds my phone on the wireless charging mat and my wallet in the space ahead. And while I’m on about storage, the boot is pretty handy, too, at 521 litres. That’s around what some SUVs offer. So, if plans materialise, I’ll be off to Goa soon, and after a raft of SUVs, I think it’s this sedan I’ll take this time around.
