  "description": "Having facelifted the Taycan line-up earlier this year, Porsche has now unveiled three new variants – the Taycan GTS sedan, Taycan GTS Sport Turismo and Taycan 4 sedan – thereby completing the range, which now comprises 16 variants in total. Porsche calls this new middle-rung GTS the “all-rounder” variant of the updated electric performance car. Taycan GTS variants use a 97kWh battery with 690hp Base Taycan sedan gets four-wheel drive for the first time Porsche Taycan GTS: range and specs Sitting between the 4S and the Turbo, the new Taycan GTS and GTS Sport Turismo variants are fitted with a 97kWh (usable) battery pack, which officially yields a range of 628km between charges – an improvement of about 120km. It now packs up to 700hp (when using the Launch Control function), an increase of 102hp over the old GTS, thanks to a new rear electric motor that makes 108hp and 40Nm more, yet weighs 10kg less. As such, the GTS’s 0-100kph sprint time is reduced by 0.4 seconds to 3.3 seconds. Porsche said the GTS also gets a specific suspension setup with a “particularly sporty edge”, although agility-boosting rear-wheel steering and the trick Active Ride system are optional extras. Porsche Taycan GTS: exterior and interior Visually, it’s distinguished by the ‘Sport’ front end from the base model and the 4S, and its air inlets are painted in a contrasting high-gloss black. The wheels, measuring either 20-inch or 21-inch, are available exclusively in Anthracite Grey. Inside, both GTS variants get 18-way adjustable bucket seats finished in the suede-like Race-Tex fabric, and the multi-function steering wheel from the range-topping Taycan Turbo GT is available as an option. These also receive a bespoke acceleration and deceleration soundtrack that’s said “to do justice to the exhilarating character of a GTS”. Porsche Taycan 4: what’s new? The Taycan’s base variant was so far only available in rear-wheel drive form, but the new Taycan 4 variant brings the all-wheel-drive configuration. In terms of performance, depending on whether it gets the standard Performance battery or the optional Performance Plus battery, the Taycan 4 can produce up to 408hp or 435hp when using Launch Control and has a certified range of up to 643km. The Taycan 4 takes 4.4 seconds to go from 0 to 100kph, 0.1 seconds faster than its rear-wheel-drive model sibling. Porsche Traction Management (PTM) and Adaptive Air Suspension with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) are fitted as standard on the Taycan 4. All three models also benefit from the updates in terms of design and equipment, which Porsche introduced in the Taycan for the 2025 model year. All Taycan versions feature an even more extensive standard equipment list and come with the latest generation of the Porsche Driver Experience.
