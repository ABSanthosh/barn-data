  "text": "The rugged off-roader has a roof rack, a 2.5-inch lift, and 35-inch tires November 18, 2024 at 19:28 by Michael Gauthier Following an appearance at the SEMA Show, a modified Toyota Land Cruiser has gone up for sale. It features a 2.5-inch lift, 35-inch tires, and a host of other upgrades. The dealership is asking $89,754 and claims it has $18,995 worth of upgrades. With the SEMA Show firmly behind us, we’re already seeing a handful of builds going up for sale. One of the latest is this 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser. Currently listed for $89,754 by Bommarito Toyota, the one-off model has been equipped with $18,995 of upgrades including a 2.5-inch (64 mm) lift and Method wheels wrapped in 35-inch Toyo Open Country tires. The Land Cruiser has also been outfitted with retro-inspired stripes and enough lights for a small airport.

The model also has Molle panels covering the rear quarter glass as visibility is overrated. While the listing is light on specifics, the SUV was transformed by Auto Trim Restyling. It recently made an appearance at the SEMA Show, where it won the people’s choice award for the Pro Cup Challenge.

Given those nuggets of information, there appears to be a pretty sizable markup, although that’s all too common for Toyota dealers these days. Like the standard model, the body-on-frame SUV has an i-Force Max hybrid powertrain that consists of a turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, a space robbing 1.87 kWh battery, and an eight-speed automatic transmission with an integrated electric motor. This enables the model to produce 326 hp (243 kW / 331 PS) and 465 lb-ft (630 Nm) of torque. Bommarito Toyota",
