  "description": "A weekend escape in our long-term Mercedes-Benz EQS 450 4MATIC SUV was long overdue. No long termer of ours truly earns its stripes until it’s taken for a run up into the hills. And the Mumbai-Mahabaleshwar drive is nothing short of a trial by fire when it comes to real-world range. I’m happy to report that the big Merc absolutely aced it. Standard operating procedure is to top up our EV long termers at the Autocar India HQ on the 22kW AC charger before heading out. With the battery showing 99 percent, I was good to go. Within seven minutes, I was already on the lower entry ramp to the Atal Setu. This marvel of a bridge has been operational for over a year now, but I still find myself marvelling at how it has transformed the drive out of Mumbai. It’s dramatically reduced the journey time to Mahabaleshwar too – the drive took just three and a half hours! Phenomenal range makes road trips easy. The real highlight, though, was how effortlessly the EQS 450 devoured the kilometres. There was no need for hypermiling, no range anxiety, and absolutely no drama. At the base of the Ambenali ghat, 197km in, the state of charge still read a reassuring 48 percent. That gave me the confidence to push harder on the climb, which, admittedly, did eat up 22 percent of charge over the 30km ascent. Still, I rolled into Mahabaleshwar with 26 percent remaining – more than enough buffer. The return leg was even more impressive. I took the longer route back via Pune, with a detour through Wai that added nearly 50km. But thanks to a healthy dose of regeneration on the descent from 4,500 feet, I arrived back at base with a staggering 55 percent charge remaining after 320km of normal driving – and by that I mean no pussyfooting. That puts the real-world range at around 730km; downhill advantage, yes, but that’s exceptional for a car this size. Refinement levels are outstanding. Of course, efficiency like this doesn’t happen by chance. The EQS SUV’s design may not win over fans of traditional SUV styling – it’s more blob than brawn – but there’s serious aerodynamic intent behind its teardrop silhouette. Every curve and contour is tuned to cheat the wind, and it pays off handsomely in terms of range. It might lack visual ruggedness, but its slipperiness delivers where it counts. Inside, the EQS 450 continues to impress. The cabin is whisper-quiet, with barely any wind or tyre noise making its way in. On long road trips, that level of hush makes a huge difference. It’s genuinely relaxing – almost like travelling in a soundproof lounge. Brakes need better bite and stopping power. That said, it’s not without flaws. The brakes need work. The pedal lacks bite, and stopping power just doesn’t feel strong enough. You often find yourself relying heavily on regen to slow this 2,840kg SUV down, especially on steep descents. And while the air suspension does a decent job most of the time, it doesn’t always feel settled over broken surfaces, particularly on patchy sections of the NH66. Even in Sport mode, there’s noticeable vertical movement that takes away from the sense of composure. Lots of body movement can be felt on uneven roads. Charging in Mahabaleshwar wasn’t a problem, though it wasn’t quick either. I used a 3.3kW portable charger I keep at the house (bought online), which turned out to be twice as fast as the official 3.3kW 15A unit that, for some reason, wouldn’t go beyond 1.9kW. Even so, a full charge took 36 hours, but given that Mahabaleshwar is my hibernation zone, it suited the pace perfectly. So, what’s the takeaway? The EQS 450 4MATIC SUV may not fit the mould of a traditional luxury SUV, but it delivers where it matters most for an EV – range and refinement. It’s not without its quirks, but as a long-distance electric cruiser, it’s deeply impressive. This is the kind of machine that redefines the EV road trip, and does it with remarkable ease.
