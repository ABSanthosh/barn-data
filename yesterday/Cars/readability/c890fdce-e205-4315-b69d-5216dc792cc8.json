  "description": "This 1967 Jaguar XKE Series I coupe was refurbished between 2000 and 2002 by Steve Gordon of Vintage Auto Service in Oakland, California, and it was acquired by the current owner in 2013. The car is powered by a 4.2-liter inline-six linked to a four-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, and it is finished in Opalescent Maroon over tan leather upholstery. Equipment includes enclosed headlights, chrome 15\" wire-spoke steel wheels, power-assisted disc brakes, a Becker Europa AM/FM radio, aftermarket speakers, and air conditioning. Work in preparation for the sale included adjusting the carburetors and replacing suspension bushings, brake hoses, and cam cover gaskets. Previously offered on BaT in September 2024, this XKE Series I coupe is offered again in Arizona on dealer consignment with a Jaguar Heritage Trust Certificate, refurbishment records and photographs, service records, an operator's manual, a Formawerx Jaguar key, and a clean Texas title.",

The car is powered by a 4.2-liter inline-six linked to a four-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, and it is finished in Opalescent Maroon over tan leather upholstery. Equipment includes enclosed headlights, chrome 15″ wire-spoke steel wheels, power-assisted disc brakes, a Becker Europa AM/FM radio, aftermarket speakers, and air conditioning. Work in preparation for the sale included adjusting the carburetors and replacing suspension bushings, brake hoses, and cam cover gaskets. Previously offered on BaT in September 2024, this XKE Series I coupe is offered again in Arizona on dealer consignment with a Jaguar Heritage Trust Certificate, refurbishment records and photographs, service records, an operator’s manual, a Formawerx Jaguar key, and a clean Texas title. The car left the factory finished in Opalescent Maroon, and it is said to have been refinished during the refurbishment. Exterior details include enclosed headlights, a louvered clamshell hood, wraparound chrome bumpers, triple windshield wipers, a side-hinged rear hatch, and dual exhaust outlets. The left floor pan was cleaned and re-sealed in preparation for the sale. Chrome 15″ wire wheels are secured by two-eared knock-offs and are mounted with Michelin Defender tires measuring 205/65. A matching spare with an older tire is stowed in the trunk. Braking is provided by four-wheel discs with inboard-mounted rear rotors. Service in January 2025 consisted of bleeding the brakes and replacing the brake hoses and front suspension bushings. The bucket seats are upholstered in tan leather that extends to the center console and door panels. Interior appointments include black vinyl dashboard trim, a Becker Europa AM/FM radio, aftermarket speakers, and air conditioning. The wood-rimmed steering wheel frames a Smiths 160-mph speedometer and 6k-rpm tachometer, while auxiliary gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel level, and amperage are located in the center of the dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows 1,600 miles, although approximately 1,700 miles have been added under current ownership. The odometer is reported to have turned over under current ownership, and total mileage is unknown. The 4.2-liter inline-six features triple SU carburetors and was factory rated at 265 horsepower and 283 lb-ft of torque. Work in January 2025 included completing an oil change, adjusting the carburetors, bleeding the cooling system, and replacing the accessory belt, cam cover gaskets, header tank, hoses, and engine and stabilizer mounts. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a full-synchromesh four-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Drivetrain and vehicle stamps are displayed in the gallery. The Jaguar Heritage Trust Production Record Trace Certificate lists the original colors and drivetrain numbers as well as the build and dispatch dates. Refurbishment records totaling approximately $61k are displayed in the gallery, along with photographs documenting the process. A jack kit and a tool roll are also included in the sale.
