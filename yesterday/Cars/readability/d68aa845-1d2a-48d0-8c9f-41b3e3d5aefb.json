Features include an aftermarket black soft top, a bikini top, a roll bar, fog lamps, chrome bumpers, American Racing wheels, front disc brakes, a rear tire carrier with a jerrycan, a lockable Tuffy console, AutoMeter instrumentation, and a Kenwood AM/FM/CD stereo. The truck spent time in Arizona and Texas and was sold on BaT in May 2022 before being acquired by the seller. This Commando is offered with a clean New Jersey title in the seller’s name. The truck was repainted in metallic copper under previous ownership. Features include a full-length black soft top, a bikini soft top, a roll bar, fog lamps, chrome bumpers and hood latches, dual mirrors, and a swing-out spare tire carrier with a jerrycan mount. There are touched-up chips on the hood and paint damage is located below the fuel filler. There is a patched hole in the soft top. The 15″ American Racing aluminum wheels are mounted with 31×10.5″ Pro Comp All Terrain white-letter tires. The truck is equipped with unassisted steering and locking front hubs. Braking is handled by manual front discs and rear drums. The cabin features front PRP Racing bucket seats upholstered in gray cloth and a rear bench upholstered in gray vinyl, and the floor is coated in bedliner material. Equipment includes a heater, a dash-mounted battery kill switch, four-point harnesses, aftermarket speakers, and a Kenwood AM/FM/CD stereo mounted in the lockable Tuffy center console. The driver’s seat cover is worn. The three-spoke Grant steering wheel frames an AutoMeter 120-mph speedometer and a tachometer. Matching gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and voltage as well as an electric clock are mounted in the center of the dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows 7k miles, approximately 200 of which were added by the seller. Total mileage is unknown. The retrofitted Chevrolet 350ci V8 breathes through a Weiand intake manifold and a Rochester four-barrel carburetor and features an Edelbrock open-element air cleaner and valve covers, an MSD electronic ignition, a four-core aluminum radiator, and ceramic-coated headers. The seller notes that the carburetor does not have a functional choke and the accelerator pedal must be pumped on cold starts. The fuel system was flushed and a new fuel filter was installed in July 2024, at which time the oil was changed. Power is delivered to the rear or all four wheels through a three-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. A Lakewood steel bell housing and custom 30-gallon fuel tank were reportedly installed. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
