  "description": "For buyers who crave the thrill of a sports car without giving up the space and practicality of a sedan, the BMW M340i has always been an enticing option. While its blistering performance and attractive pricing made it a standout, its stiff suspension often compromised everyday comfort. With the 2025 update, BMW has addressed that concern in a big way. 2025 BMW M340i performance, ride and handling Now gets Adaptive M Suspension Adjustable damper settings transform the way this M340i behaves. The headline change? The addition of Adaptive M Suspension, previously exclusive to the now-discontinued X3 M40i in India. This system allows drivers to toggle between firmer or softer shock absorber settings at the push of a button, transforming the car’s ride quality. Yes, the 19-inch wheels and run-flat tyres still make it firmer than the standard long-wheelbase 3 Series, but in Comfort mode, the ride is significantly more forgiving than the outgoing model. Switch to Sport mode, and the M340i tightens up dramatically, delivering the razor-sharp agility and direct steering feel you would expect from a performance sedan. The new flat-bottomed steering wheel with a red 12 o’clock marker enhances the sporty vibe further. The ride quality is softer and far more forgiving than before.   Retains 374hp, 6-cylinder turbo-petrol engine The M340i retains its B58 3-litre 6-cylinder turbo-petrol engine, which makes 374hp and 500Nm. Those who have experienced the earlier iterations of the M340i will quickly point out that this unit is much quieter, especially in Eco and Normal drive modes. The engine sound, though, is prominently amplified by the cabin speakers in Sport and Sport Plus, and with BMW’s ‘iconic sounds’ turned on, you will also hear occasional crackles from the M exhaust. Yes, the sound is synthesised, but this 6-cylinder mill sounds sweet when revved hard. The 3-litre, 6-cyl unit is quieter than before; performance remains explosive.   0-100kph comes up in 4.39 seconds 2025 BMW M340i performance as testedAcceleration Time0-20kph0.70s0-40kph1.31s0-60kph2.14s0-80kph3.16s0-100kph4.39s0-120kph5.96s0-140kph7.75s20-80kph (kickdown)3.00s40-100kph (kickdown)3.39s The best bit is that performance remains explosive. In our performance tests, it sprints from 0 to 100kph in merely 4.39 seconds, and it hits 200kph rather effortlessly. Also, it retains the 48-Volt mild hybrid system, which facilitates a rather seamless automatic engine stop-start function to reduce fuel consumption while idling.  Complementing this engine is a fantastic 8-speed torque converter automatic, which transmits power to all four wheels. Besides being smooth and quick, it is a rather clever transmission, and you’ll seldom find this powertrain caught off guard when you put your foot down. For manual control, though, it gets paddle shifters, which certainly elevate driver engagement. 2025 BMW M340i exterior and interior New colour option and alloy wheels New blacked-out 19-inch alloys and red brake calipers look sporty. With this update, the M340i gets two new paint options, one of them being Arctic Race Blue, as seen on the test car. It also gets new blacked-out alloys as well as red brake calipers. Changes to the interior are minimal, with the most prominent ones being the new flat-bottomed steering with a red 12 o’clock marker and redesigned central air vents – though the latter feels flimsy to operate. The curved touchscreen now features an updated software interface, but it still feels cluttered with too many apps, making it unintuitive. Redesigned air vents feel flimsy in operation; flat-bottomed steering with a red 12 o’clock marker looks racy.   2025 BMW M340i price and verdict Rs 6 lakh more expensive than the 2023 model At Rs 74.90 lakh, this iteration is nearly Rs 6 lakh pricier than the 2023 version. However, the newly added Adaptive M suspension justifies this price premium. It has transformed this car’s character, making it more comfortable than before without hampering driver engagement. With stonking performance, adequate cabin room, a 480-litre boot and a decent standard kit, the M340i exerts serious appeal. If you love to drive and are in the market for a daily driver within Rs 1 crore, your search should end here.
