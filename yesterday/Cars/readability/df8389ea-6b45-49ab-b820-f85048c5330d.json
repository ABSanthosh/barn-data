  "description": "This 1969 Chevrolet Camaro coupe is one of what is believed to be approximately 1,000 examples ordered with the COPO 427ci L72 V8 for the model year. Ordered new through the Performance Division of Belmont Chevrolet–Oldsmobile in Weston, Ontario, the car was raced by the original owner and stored through the late 1970s. It has since changed hands several times, undergoing two refurbishments during which the body was refinished in Olympic Gold over a reupholstered Midnight Green interior and the engine was removed and stored for over two decades. Equipment includes a Muncie M21 four-speed manual transmission, a Hurst shifter, and a 12-bolt rear end with a Positraction differential as well as power front disc brakes, 14″ XT steel wheels, a chambered dual exhaust system, a Holley carburetor, a Winters high-rise intake manifold, and a cowl-induction hood. This COPO Camaro was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024 and is now offered with manufacturer's literature, a window sticker, original sales documents, a Fisher Body Control Card, a Protect-O-Plate, a Chevy Classics Club Platinum Certificate, GM Canada correspondence and documentation, historical photos, and a clean Texas title.",

Ordered new through the Performance Division of Belmont Chevrolet–Oldsmobile in Weston, Ontario, the car was raced by the original owner and stored through the late 1970s. It has since changed hands several times, undergoing two refurbishments during which the body was refinished in Olympic Gold over a reupholstered Midnight Green interior and the engine was removed and stored for over two decades. Equipment includes a Muncie M21 four-speed manual transmission, a Hurst shifter, and a 12-bolt rear end with a Positraction differential as well as power front disc brakes, 14″ XT steel wheels, a chambered dual exhaust system, a Holley carburetor, a Winters high-rise intake manifold, and a cowl-induction hood. This COPO Camaro was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024 and is now offered with manufacturer’s literature, a window sticker, original sales documents, a Fisher Body Control Card, a Protect-O-Plate, a Chevy Classics Club Platinum Certificate, GM Canada correspondence and documentation, historical photos, and a clean Texas title. For 1969, the Central Office Production Order (COPO), which was originally developed for ordering non-standard fleet vehicles using RPO parts, became a tool by which enterprising dealers could circumvent the General Motors mandate that no engine of more than 400 cubic inches could be installed in an intermediate-sized vehicle like the Camaro. The coupe body is finished in Olympic Gold (65) and features a ZL2 cowl-induction hood and chrome bumpers with rear bumperettes. Additional details include dual side mirrors, chin and decklid spoilers, and bright rocker-panel trim. Body-color 14″ XT-code steel wheels wearing branded chrome hubcaps are mounted with Firestone Wide Oval white-letter tires, and a matching spare is found in the trunk. Factory equipment included power-assisted front disc brakes and rear drums. The cabin features Midnight Green vinyl upholstery with front bucket and rear bench seats and color-complementary carpeting. The car is equipped with a Hurst floor shifter, and further interior appointments include head restraints, a heater/defroster, a push-button Delco AM radio, a rear seat speaker, a blower-type rear window defogger, and lap belts. The two-spoke steering wheel fronts a 120-mph speedometer and a fuel-level gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 43k miles, a handful of which were added by the selling dealer. The 427ci L72 Turbo Jet V8 was factory rated at 425 horsepower and could be ordered for the 1969 Camaro only through the Central Office Production Order (COPO) program. This example is equipped with a high-lift camshaft, solid valve lifters, a Holley four-barrel carburetor, an L78 cowl-induction air cleaner, a Winters aluminum high-rise intake manifold, a heavy-duty radiator, and a chambered dual exhaust system. The Muncie M21 close-ratio four-speed manual transmission is linked to a BE-coded 12-bolt rear axle with a Positraction differential and a 4.10:1 final gear ratio. The seller states that the underbody has been touched up to replicate assembly line paint and chalk marks. In addition to general accessories, the Belmont Chev-Olds order form dated March 1969 specifies by way of a handwritten entry the “427-425 ENGINE”, while a transactional version of the form dated July of that year lists Central Office Production Order number 9561 denoting the 427/425. It also shows that the original owner traded a 1968 Oldsmobile 442 and paid a balance of $1,820 to complete the sale. The car received 998 of a possible 1,000 points in judging at the Eckler’s Chevy Classic Club 20th Annual Winter National in February 2012. You are not connected to real-time updates.
