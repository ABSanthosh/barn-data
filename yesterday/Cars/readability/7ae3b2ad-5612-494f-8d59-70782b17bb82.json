  "description": "This 1994 Porsche Turbo S 3.6 is one of 17 “Package” examples produced with standard Turbo bodywork, all of which were destined for North America. The car was ordered new by Park Place Porsche of Dallas, Texas, and subsequently transferred to Don McGill Imports Inc. in Houston, where it was purchased by its first owner. Following the second owner’s acquisition in 1998 out of Atlanta, Georgia, the car spent time in Pennsylvania and Illinois before being purchased by the current owner in 2022 and listed on BaT in February 2024. Finished in white over Classic Grey full leather upholstery, the car is powered by a turbocharged 3.6-liter flat-six fitted with the X88 Turbo S power kit and mated to a five-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential. Factory options include X99 asymmetrical side air intakes, the X92 Turbo S front lip spoiler, and the X93 Turbo S rear spoiler, and it is also equipped with 18″ Speedline multi-piece Cup wheels, a power-operated sunroof, air conditioning, power windows, a Porsche CR-1 cassette player, and a trunk-mounted six-disc CD changer. This 964 Turbo S shows under 14k miles and is offered again on dealer consignment in California with tools, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Illinois title.",

The car was ordered new by Park Place Porsche of Dallas, Texas, and subsequently transferred to Don McGill Imports Inc. in Houston, where it was purchased by its first owner. Following the second owner’s acquisition in 1998 out of Atlanta, Georgia, the car spent time in Pennsylvania and Illinois before being purchased by the current owner in 2022 and listed on BaT in February 2024. Finished in white over Classic Grey full leather upholstery, the car is powered by a turbocharged 3.6-liter flat-six fitted with the X88 Turbo S power kit and mated to a five-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential. Factory options include X99 asymmetrical side air intakes, the X92 Turbo S front lip spoiler, and the X93 Turbo S rear spoiler, and it is also equipped with 18″ Speedline multi-piece Cup wheels, a power-operated sunroof, air conditioning, power windows, a Porsche CR-1 cassette player, and a trunk-mounted six-disc CD changer. This 964 Turbo S shows under 14k miles and is offered again on dealer consignment in California with tools, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Illinois title. The turbocharged 3.6-powered 964 was introduced in January 1993 and offered through the 1994 model year. After approximately 1,400 examples had been sold, Porsche sent the remaining 93 cars to their Exclusive Department for modification with the Turbo S package. Flachbau bodywork was fitted to 76 examples, while 17 cars were sold exclusively in the North American market with standard Turbo headlights and bodywork. The photos in the listing and the gallery below were taken in January 2024, and the car reportedly has not been driven since. This example was delivered from the factory in Grand Prix White (P5) and is said to have been repainted under previous ownership. It is equipped with Turbo S features including a revised front splitter, asymmetrical 959-style quarter panel air intakes, a louvered rear spoiler, and quad exhaust tips in addition to a rear window wiper, aerodynamic side mirrors, a power-operated sunroof, and headlight washers. A collection of body panel VIN tags can be seen in the gallery. Polished 18″ Speedline Cup wheels with Turbo-script center caps measure 8″ wide up front and 10″ wide out back, and they are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport tires. Stopping power is provided by red-finished calipers with white Porsche script over cross-drilled rotors at all four corners. The cockpit features front seats with electric height adjustment that are trimmed in Classic Grey leather, which extends to the dashboard, door panels, and rear seating surfaces. Color-matching carpets are protected by black Turbo S-script floor mats, and additional equipment includes air conditioning, power windows, and a Porsche CR-1 cassette stereo linked to a trunk-mounted six-disc CD changer. The leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a 180-mph speedometer, a 7,600-rpm tachometer, an analog clock, and auxiliary gauges. The six-digit odometer shows fewer than 14k miles, approximately 30 of which were added under current ownership. The 3.6-liter M64/50 flat-six left the factory with the X88 power kit, which added modified cylinder heads and camshafts, altered timing, larger-capacity fuel injectors, and a larger turbocharger and intercooler. Output was factory rated at 380 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Turbo S models were fitted with a stronger flywheel and clutch compared to the contemporary Turbo. A quad-exit exhaust system with modified heat exchangers was also standard on the Turbo S. The engine oil was changed in December 2024. Additional photos of the underside are presented in the gallery. The underhood options tag partially decodes as follows: C02 – Ordering distributor Porsche North America X88 – 380-horsepower power kit for Turbo 3.6 X90 – Wheel caps with Porsche crest X92 – Turbo S front spoiler lip X93 – Turbo S rear spoiler X99 – Air inlets in side panels for engine cooling 407 – 18″ polished three-piece wheels 650 – Sunroof 692 – Alpine Porsche CDC-1 CD changer The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage.
