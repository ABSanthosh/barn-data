  "text": "The Maserati MCPura Coupe and Convertible (‘Cielo’) debuted at Goodwood. But which one would you go for?Jul 13, 2025 6:43 PM EDTWhile many brands brought familiar faces to this year’s Goodwood Festival of Speed, Maserati stood out with a global debut. The Italian carmaker unveiled both the coupe and Cielo convertible versions of its MC20 successor, the MCPura. It was one of the few all-new reveals at the event, and it drew plenty of attention. Meanwhile, McLaren’s hypercar was tucked away from the crowds. Sharper Style, Same Core Maserati plays on Einstein’s iconic formula, E = MCPURA, with “MC” standing for Maserati Corse and “Pura” meaning “pure” in Italian. PR theatrics aside, the updates are subtle but intentional. The MCPura sticks with the same 3.0-liter twin-turbo Nettuno V6 as the MC20, but thanks to refined materials and increased carbon fiber use, it now has a dry weight of just 3,043 lbs. That is about 300 lbs less than before. On display at Goodwood were both coupe and Cielo convertible versions, finished in a stunning Ai Aqua Rainbow color. The paint shimmered in the sun like a prism, matte on the coupe and glossy on the Cielo. The new magenta Trident badges with blue mica accents add flair, and the redesigned wheels even more. While the MC20 leaned more luxurious, the MCPura’s cabin is sportier. It swaps leather for Alcantara, and the laser-etched Trident logos on the “Alcantara Ice” seats make them a clear focal point. A slightly revised steering wheel rounds out the changes inside. Subtle, Purposeful Upgrades The highlight feature is the topless Cielo’s new retractable roof. Made from polymer-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) glass, it can switch from clear to opaque in an instant. Maserati says it’s the first roof of its kind in this segment. The MCPura also benefits from a stiffer carbon-fiber monocoque and aerodynamic changes inspired by the MC20 GT2, including a revised front end for better downforce. The Nettuno V6 still delivers 621 hp, 538 lb-ft of torque, and a redline of 8,000 rpm. As before, the car is built entirely in Modena. Italian At Heart The MCPura represents Maserati’s commitment to Italian craftsmanship and exclusivity. The Maserati Fuoriserie program offers over 30 color choices, including Devil Orange, Verde Royale, and Night Interaction, letting owners build something truly personal. The MCPura may not be a new model built from the ground up, but it is a sharper and lighter recipe of what already worked. At Goodwood, it proved Maserati can evolve the sports car without falling victim to electricification. About the AuthorMarnus MoolmanKeep Reading",
