  "text": "Giamaro Automobili’s Katla is expected to weigh under 3,200 lbs and deliver up to 2,127 hp May 22, 2025 at 20:31 by Michael Gauthier A new company called Giamaro Automobili has unveiled the Katla and Albor. The Katla is a street-focused hypercar, while the Albor is a rally-inspired variant. Both feature a 7.0-liter V12 engine with four turbochargers and up to 2,127 hp. Giamaro Automobili has burst onto the scene with an all-new hypercar called the Katla. It’s a welcome departure from forgettable EVs, as it features a quad-turbocharged 7.0-liter V12 engine that was developed entirely in-house. Power figures are nothing short of outrageous. The Katla is said to deliver either 1,647 hp (1,228 kW / 1,670 PS) and 1,147 lb-ft (1,556 Nm) of torque, or a staggering 2,127 hp (1,586 kW / 2,157 PS) and 1,481 lb-ft (2,008 Nm), depending on the variant. Those are some truly impressive numbers as the range-topping variant would be more powerful than the Bugatti Tourbillon. More: De Tomaso’s New Supercar Is A Manual Love Letter To Drivers While there’s no word on additional performance specs, the engine is connected to a seven-speed transmission. But what’s more impressive, or rather, frightening, is that it sends power to the rear wheels only, via a limited-slip differential. Yes, just the rear wheels. The company also mentioned that an 11-speed dual-clutch gearbox is currently in development. On the styling front, the Katla looks like a generic supercar spit out by AI. The company didn’t say much about it, but the model has a ventilated hood and ‘floating’ LED daytime running lights. They’re apparently joined by gullwing doors and a sleek body that channels air to the mid-mounted engine. We can also see C-shaped LED taillights and a sizable diffuser. The car rides on 20- and 21-inch wheels that are wrapped in Bridgestone Potenza Sport tires. They’re backed up by a beefy braking system that features 10- and 4-piston calipers as well as discs measuring 16.5 inches (420 mm) at all four corners. The model also has an active rear wing that maximizes downforce and can act as an air brake. In terms of size, the Katla measures 188.6 inches (4,791 mm) long and has a wheelbase that spans 108.3 inches (2,750 mm). This means it’s a few inches larger than the Corvette. The Italian firm was tight-lipped about the interior, but it features an aviation-inspired cockpit with aluminum, carbon fiber, and “refined textile weaves.” They’re joined by a digital instrument cluster and an infotainment system that is angled towards the driver. Elsewhere, we can see a flat-bottom steering wheel and a push button shifter. The company also throws in a pair of sport seats and minimalist controls. The Katla has a carbon fiber monocoque that weighs 375 lbs (170 kg). This helps the car to tip the scales at a claimed 3,197 lbs (1,450 kg), which is impressively light especially for something with a V12 engine. The Katla is said to have a 42:58 weight distribution as well as an advanced suspension that uses solid aluminum alloy components as well as electronically adjustable dampers. The model is also slated to have a ride height that “adjusts automatically to balance aerodynamic efficiency and everyday usability.” A Second Model Called The Albor Is In The Works Besides revealing the Katla, Giamaro provided an early glimpse at the Albor. It’s a rugged hypercar that appears to draw inspiration from the Lamborghini Huracan Sterrato. As a result, it features an increased ride height and chunky carbon fiber fender flares. They’re joined by unique bodywork and lighting units as well as a prominent exhaust system. Giamaro is keeping details under wraps, but said the car was named after the Albor Tholus volcano on Mars. They also revealed the model uses the same monocoque and engine as the Katla.",
