  "text": "The larger of the two recall actions affects the Hornet and Tonale siblings April 21, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier Stellantis is recalling nearly 50,000 vehicles in the United States over two different issues. The Alfa Romeo Tonale and Dodge Hornet may not display a rearview image when reversing. Some Maserati GranTurismos are being recalled due to a paint job that causes labels to fall off. It’s recallapalooza as Stellantis has issued a couple of recalls shortly after Ford issued five in one day. The latest batch impacts a number of vehicles from Alfa Romeo and Dodge as well as a handful from Maserati. Starting with the former, Dodge is recalling 40,372 Hornets while Alfa is recalling 8,122 Tonales. The badge engineered crossovers have a display module that may not show a rearview camera image when in reverse. This means they fail to comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. More: If You Thought The Charger’s Discounts Were Crazy, Wait Till You See The Hornet’s The government agency says approximately 1% of the 48,494 vehicles may have “cold soldering on a voltage regulator and/or a software defect within the microprocessor which may result in the vehicle not displaying the rearview image.” The issue impacts 2023-2025 models and Stellantis began an investigation in March of last year in Europe. It eventually led to a recall, which will see dealerships either replace the infotainment system or update its software. Owner notifications are expected to go out in June. Moving on, Maserati is recalling 21 GranTurismo vehicles from the 2024 model year. These have a very specific textured topcoat, which can cause manufacturer and tire labels to fall off. This is an odd recall, but Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards require that certain information be displayed on a permanently affixed placard on the driver’s side B-pillar. Since the label can fall off, these vehicles don’t comply with that regulation. The cars feature a Nero Scarabeo clear coat exterior and Maserati determined the “root cause to be that the glue applied to the label may not properly adhere to the final finish clear coat.” The fix is as simple as you’d expect as owners will get new labels that, hopefully, stay in place.",
