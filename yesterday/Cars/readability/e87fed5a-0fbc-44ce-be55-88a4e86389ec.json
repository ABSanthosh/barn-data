It is finished in Argento Nurburgring over Nero leather and is powered by a 3.6-liter V8 paired with a six-speed F1 sequential transaxle. Equipment includes 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels, a black convertible soft top, a Challenge-style rear grille, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, power-adjustable Daytona-style seats, a Kenwood CD stereo, and automatic climate control. This 360 Spider is now offered on dealer consignment with the owner’s manual, service records, tools, a spare head unit, a car cover, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Texas title. The Pininfarina-designed aluminum body is finished in Argento Nurburgring and features xenon headlights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, a power-retractable black convertible soft top, a Challenge-style rear grille, and quad exhaust outlets exiting through the rear fascia. The soft top’s hydraulic cylinders were rebuilt in June 2022, and the soft top cover was repainted in August 2023. Clear paint-protection film has been applied to the nose. Photos detailing the condition of the body are included in the gallery. The 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Goodyear Eagle Sport tires. A photo in the gallery shows cracks on a sidewall. Stopping power is from red-finished Ferrari-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors at each corner. The cockpit features power-adjustable Daytona-style seats upholstered in Nero leather along with matching door panel inserts and carpets. Amenities include a wind deflector, a Kenwood CD stereo, aluminum pedals, and automatic climate control. Aftermarket subwoofers are stationed behind the seats. The reverse lever was replaced in August 2023, and the climate control system was repaired in March 2025. The removed head unit is included in the sale. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 220-mph speedometer and a tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as a digital fuel level readout and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, and coolant temperature. Aftermarket carbon paddle shifters for the F1 gearbox are mounted behind the steering wheel. The digital odometer indicates 32k miles, approximately 2k of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 3.6-liter Tipo F131 V8 features a flat-plane crankshaft, dry-sump lubrication, dual overhead camshafts, and five valves per cylinder. Factory-rated output was 395 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. A belt service was performed and the spark plugs were replaced in May 2021, the fuel pumps were replaced in August 2023, and the battery was replaced in March 2025. Power is sent to the rear wheels through an electrohydraulic six-speed F1 sequential transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Skid plates were installed in May 2021, and work in August 2024 included replacing the clutch, pilot bearing, clutch-release bearing, clutch-position sensor, rear main seal, and transaxle mount.
