A recent survey showed that buyers in the country want that to change, finding that more than half support lower tariffs that allow more affordable vehicle models to enter the market. Clean Energy Canada’s recent survey found that 53 percent of Canadians support a “lower tariff that balances protection for Canada’s auto industry with improving affordability for consumers, in line with Europe.” Almost 30 percent of other respondents said they wanted the tariffs gone completely, while just 19 percent wanted to keep the full 100 percent tariffs in place.Where the Canadian respondents may diverge with their American counterparts is on political affiliation, as the survey found there wasn’t a significant difference between answers from people backing different parties. Beyond tariffs, one of the reasons the U.S. and Canada don’t see as many lower-cost options on sale is safety. Canada follows the United States’ vehicle safety standards, which are responsible for keeping many vehicles out of the country, but 70 percent of the survey respondents said they’d be open to relaxing some environmental and safety standards to increase their range of choice.[Image: Sean Pavone, rafaelnlins, Robert Wray via Shutterstock] Chris Teague Chris grew up in, under, and around cars, but took the long way around to becoming an automotive writer.

More by Chris Teague Published June 13th, 2025 11:30 AM Comments Join the conversation I missed in the tariff discussion earlier this year that Canada has a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs to protect local industry. I remember how that Ontario Premier was keen to try to harm Michiganders as much as possible, and how much the average Canadian was only to happy to make it known he hates America. Still, I wish them well in trying to reconcile their desires for cheap Chinese goods with the need to be able to pay for them. It also reminds me of how Lee Iacoca wanted Americans to \"buy American\" while Chrysler sought out the cheapest imported parts it could find. See 8 previous Your memory seems somewhat flawed. No 'hate' for Americans or hopes to hurt Michiganers. In fact the Governor of Michigan has met the Premier of Ontario multiple times and they tend to get along. The Premier's family business has a location in another American state (Illinois) so he is certainly not 'anti American'. The concerns are around Donald Trump and his statements about wanting to annex Canada. How would any American citizen feel if the Premier of China stated that they wanted to annex Hawaii. Or if the President of Russia stated that they intended on reclaiming Alaska? I am happy to be corrected. We saw a lot of media and a lot of crazy statements, including the heating oil threats. I think Canada is right for the tariffs, as I think the global tariff regime is being very much gamed by the world's cheapest manufacturer. The risk of Xi joking about annexing Hawaii is that Trump would probably offer him a deal for it in exchange for the outstanding public debt, and Americans might be OK with that. I was surprised the fellow who ate the apples wasn't canny enough to say that Trump should just be treated like a big talker, but instead fell in with the Labour view that Trump is an existential threat. Arthur--Not all of us hate Canada. Trump stirred this hate up as he continues to stir hate up dividing the United States. Red states against blue states. Trump thrives on division and hate. JEFF HAS DEFINITELY BEEN THE VOICE OF UNITY ON TTAC. MUCH LIKE PRUNING SHEARS EXIST TO MELD WOOD TOGETHER. Jeffy Troll why do you lie all the time? Obama refered to Republicans as enemies. Real unifying. As another Canadian.. I am totally in agreement Arthur Dailey . Threats to any countries sovereignty doesn't go well .A small minority group from the Loony Left promoted anti Americanism .. As much as the Left likes to speak for all of us, most just don't feel that way ..Our new Liberal P.M. is a Centrist ..Truth be known , Mark Carney is more of a Conservative lite than a Liberal. Mr Carney has made a commitment to meet our NATO obligations by years end ... Talk is cheap, lets hope he backs it up .. Personally I have many connections to the US. I spent my entire working life with an American company .I have a Grandchild attending a US university ... I have friends and relatives holding dual citizenship . My late wife and I travelled extensively in the States . I can't count the all inclusive Island resorts we attended .. We always bonded with American couples ( common language sort of ) .. and had a blast . This proud Canadian has no beefs with the United States or its citizens. @MrGreenMan - \"I was surprised the fellow who ate the apples wasn't canny enough to say that Trump should just be treated like a big talker\" Mr. Polievre was trapped by his \"tRump-lite\" routine. Some referred to him as Pierre DeSantis for that reason. He scared away many traditional older conservative voters and pushed \"progressive\" voters to the liberal party. We would laugh it off Arthur because you lack the ability to annex Hawaii or Alaska. Jeff 23 hours ago Arthur did not state he personally was going to annex Hawaii or Alaska nor did he claim the ability to annex either state that one is on you. Arthur wrote the following \"How would any American citizen feel if the Premier of China stated that they wanted to annex Hawaii. Or if the President of Russia stated that they intended on reclaiming Alaska?\" As an American how would we feel if China said they would annex China or how as an American how would we feel if Russia reclaimed (took back) Alaska. Trump's own words said he wanted to make Canada the 51st state. If we the citizens of the United States of America don't like other countries that threaten to annex parts of our own country then why would we expect Canadians to want to be threatened to be annexed by the United States? Only bullies threaten others. Very simple to understand what Arthur wrote but knowing that you twist what others say this is typical of what you do. You are not interested in having a discussion you are more interested in bullying. Walmart and Amazon meets the auto industry. Many buyers are only interested in their own bottom line. Buy the cheapest. So what if the \"mom and pop\" corner store goes bankrupt or well paid workers who contribute to the economy loose their jobs due to cheap imports. I got mine!!!Too much protection usually translates to an expensive but crappy product. Not enough protection means a cheap product that causes \"crap\" in various spots in the economy.This is the main reason for politics. Finding a ballance that appeals to the majority. See 1 previous \"So what if the \"mom and pop\" corner store goes bankrupt...\"Of course, you're right, Lou, but the fact is this: Mom and Pop stores have been going broke since the invention of Mom and Pop stores. Mom and Pop restaurants were put out of business by McDonalds and Pizza Hut, Mom and Pop clothing stores got put out business by Wal-Mart (which also put my dad out of business - he ran a manufacturer's rep outfit selling women's apparel to those Mom and Pop stores), and Mom and Pop grocery stores got put out of business by grocery chains (including Wal-Mart).Hell...Mom and Pop stores were getting put of business by Sears and Penney's...a century ago. It's nothing new.Economies of scale favor chains; it's market econ 101. Agree with both Lou and FreedMike good points.",

After a career in technology consulting and a trip through business school, Chris began writing about the automotive industry as a way to reconnect with his passion and get behind the wheel of a new car every week. He focuses on taking complex industry stories and making them digestible by any reader.

Still, I wish them well in trying to reconcile their desires for cheap Chinese goods with the need to be able to pay for them.
