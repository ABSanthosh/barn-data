  "text": "Upgrades made to the 2JZ-GTE engine allow this Supra to pump out a cool 400 hp November 26, 2024 at 20:01 by Brad Anderson The Toyota Supra Mk4 features a wild bodykit crafted by Japanese tuner Abflug. Nearly all of the original body panels have been replaced or extensively altered. Iconic Auctioneers estimates the car will sell for between £20,000 and £25,000. Few Japanese sports cars are more iconic as the A80 Toyota Supra, also known as the Mk4. It was built between 1993 and 2002 and while production wasn’t particularly limited, prices of pristine used models have soared in recent years. This 1993 Supra, currently up for sale in the UK, won’t break any price records, but it’s certainly among the most dramatic (if not exactly beautiful) examples we’ve seen in quite some time. When looking at the car from the front three-quarters, you may not even be able to recognize it as a Supra. This is because it’s adorned with a bodykit from Japanese tuner Abflug. This isn’t a regular bodykit, either, and the car would have looked right at home in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Read: Toyota Will Keep The Supra Alive Even If BMW Kills Z4 Abflug has had its way with the Japanese sports coupe, crafting a wild new fascia for it with a unique grille, intakes, and large fog lights. New shrouds around the headlights give the car a distinctive look, as do the air vents on the hood. The sides are also just as over-the-top and include new arches and intakes, as well as bodywork that protrudes out from the door skins. The kit continues across the rear to include a large lip spoiler and a new diffuser. While the kit won’t be to everyone’s taste, there’s no denying that it’s striking and makes this Supra stand out from most others. A look under the hood reveals plenty of modifications have been made to the 2JZ-GTE turbocharged inline-six, and it’s now said to be good for 400 hp. Unfortunately, the engine isn’t mated to the desirable manual ‘box but rather the four-speed automatic.

The car has been driven a touch over 121,000 km (~75,000 miles), having spent its first decade living in Japan before being exported to the UK in 2004. Image Credit: Classic.com",
