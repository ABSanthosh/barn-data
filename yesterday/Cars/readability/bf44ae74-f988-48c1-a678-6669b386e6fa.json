  "text": "The fact that the cyclists had taken over the Olympic Boulevard in Los Angeles can't justify the dangerous manners of the driver January 7, 2025 at 19:44 by Thanos Pappas A Mercedes was filmed driving recklessly near a large group of teens on bicycles. Another video shows the group attacking the sedan and what appears to be its driver. Reports have surfaced of flash mob robbers riding bicycles in the Los Angeles area. A video has emerged capturing the reckless behavior of a frustrated Mercedes driver clashing with a large group of teenage cyclists who had taken over a Los Angeles boulevard. Fortunately, no collision occurred, but tensions escalated into violence after the cyclists spotted the car in a nearby parking lot. A chaotic clash between a frustrated Mercedes driver and a massive group of teenage cyclists has surfaced in a video circulating online. The incident, which unfolded on a busy Los Angeles boulevard, thankfully didn’t end in a collision—but it did escalate into a heated altercation when the cyclists later spotted the car parked nearby. The one-minute clip, which quickly went viral on Instagram and Reddit, appears to have been filmed by someone riding a dirt bike. It captures a white Mercedes C-Class W203 weaving erratically through a swarm of cyclists, its driver slamming the brakes and executing reckless maneuvers that come dangerously close to hitting the riders. More: New California Laws In 2025 Target Speeding, Street Takeovers, And More In an attempt to overtake the cyclists, who were occupying most of the road’s lanes, the Mercedes driver runs red lights, floors the gas pedal, and even veers onto the wrong side of the road. The entire sequence paints a chaotic picture of impatience meeting disorganized road use. The incident reportedly took place last Saturday on Olympic Boulevard, a major artery slicing through Los Angeles, California. A follow-up video, shared on Instagram, allegedly shows the aftermath—members of the cycling group violently confronting the white Mercedes and its driver in a nearby parking lot. In California, cyclists moving slower than traffic are generally required to stick to the right side of the road whenever it’s safe. There are exceptions, such as when passing, turning left, avoiding obstacles, or if the lane is too narrow to share with cars. Riding side-by-side is usually fine, as long as it doesn’t obstruct traffic, though local rules might have additional restrictions. [USA] Mercedes drives through bicyclists in LA byu/tefunka inRoadcam Locals were quick to point out that this isn’t the first time such a cyclist gathering has disrupted the area. Similar events have been reported in the past, including a story covered by ABC 7 Eyewitness News last year about “flash mob robberies” involving groups of teenagers on bicycles. While there’s no confirmation that this incident is related, the comparison has sparked discussions among residents. Unsurprisingly, the internet has picked sides, with opinions predictably polarized. Some commenters were quick to condemn the Mercedes driver for their reckless behavior, while others defended their frustration, pointing fingers at the cyclists for monopolizing a busy road. The comments section on social media has turned into a microcosm of the age-old battle between motorists and cyclists, neither side willing to yield ground.",
