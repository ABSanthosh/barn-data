It is finished in Azzurro Thetys over Terra Dirce and Nero Ade leather upholstery, and it is powered by a 6.5-liter V12 linked with a seven-speed ISR automated manual transmission and a Haldex all-wheel-drive system. Equipment includes a limited-slip rear differential, carbon-ceramic brakes, 20” and 21” Dione wheels, removable roof panels, bi-xenon headlights, transparent engine cover louvers, a rear-view camera, parking sensors, heated power-adjustable seats, a Lamborghini sound system, cruise control, and automatic climate control. This Aventador roadster was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024 and is now offered with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, a car cover, two keys, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title. The Aventador was designed by Filippo Perini, and the roadster variant debuted in December 2012 with production beginning in 2013. This example is finished in Azzurro Thetys and features two removable carbon-fiber roof panels that can be stored in the front luggage compartment. Additional details includes a carbon-fiber composite monocoque shell, scissor doors, bi-xenon headlights, transparent engine cover louvers, a rear-view camera, front and rear parking sensors, and a center-exit exhaust. Forged 20″ and 21″ Dione wheels are mounted with Pirelli tires. The car is equipped with a magnetic push-rod suspension, and stopping power is provided by black-painted multi-piston calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners. The heated power-adjustable bucket seats are trimmed in Terra Dirce, while Nero Ade leather accents the cabin. Equipment includes cruise control, automatic climate control, a Lamborghini sound system, and an infotainment system with a 7″ TFT display. The leather-trimmed multi-function steering wheel frames a digital gauge cluster with a central tachometer, a speed readout, and auxiliary gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and oil temperature. The digital odometer indicates 3,200 miles. The mid-mounted 6.5-liter V12 was factory rated at 691 horsepower and 509 lb-ft of torque. The car passed an emissions inspection in July 2022. Power is sent to all four wheels through a seven-speed single-clutch ISR automated manual transmission and a Haldex all-wheel-drive system with a limited-slip rear differential. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Raging Bull Carolinas of Concord, North Carolina, along with factory colors, equipment, options, and a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $487,195.
