  "description": "BaT member N555rf sent us a brief note on this 1964 Chrysler 300K hardtop that he won from StrokerAce80 in a November 2023 BaT auction: I love this 60-year-old time capsule. I wish I had aged this well over my first sixty years! The original paint and interior show wear but still remain elegant. Driving a car from this era reminded me how much things have changed. There's virtually no plastic, and everything feels solid. Then there is the size! This baby makes a late-model F-250 in the parking lot look like a mini truck.",

I wish I had aged this well over my first sixty years! The original paint and interior show wear but still remain elegant. Driving a car from this era reminded me how much things have changed. There’s virtually no plastic, and everything feels solid. Then there is the size! This baby makes a late-model F-250 in the parking lot look like a mini truck. This is the third car I have purchased on BaT, and my experiences have all been great. A tribute to a system that makes it tough for misrepresented “junkers” to get through without being spotted by someone. If you have a Success Story about a car you’ve bought or sold on BaT, please send a few lines and pictures (or a video) to community.content@bringatrailer.com, and we’ll send you a $50 credit to the BaT Gear Store when your story posts to the site. We also love to hear from satisfied BaT buyers and sellers, and a Success Story feature is a great addition to any car’s history when you’re ready to sell.",
