  "description": "Pune-based Vayve Mobility will present its Eva electric vehicle, which charges via solar power, in production spec at the 2025 Bharat Mobility Global Expo being held from 17th to 22nd of January in Delhi. Vayve debuted the Eva concept featuring a roof-mounted solar panel at the Auto Expo in 2023.  Eva’s solar panel doubles up as a panoramic sunroof It supports charging via both the Sun and standard electrical outlets It’s designed for an average daily commute below 35km Vayve Eva EV: design, colours Sitting on a 2,200mm wheelbase, the Eva is 3,060mm long, 1,150mm wide and 1,590mm high. For reference, the wheelbase and length are slightly more than the MG Comet EV, which has a height of 1,505mm and a width of 1,640mm. The tyre size is 13 inches (12 inches in the Comet). The quadricycle-like design is aimed at aerodynamic efficiency, as with any other electric vehicle.  A total of six colours will be on offer: Moonstone White, Light Platinum, Rose Coral, Sky Blue, Champagne Gold and Cherry Red. Vayve Eva EV: interior, seating capacity  Besides focusing on driver visibility, Vayve has also equipped Eva’s cabin with features such as touchscreen and digital information displays, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity, panoramic sunroof, six-way adjustable driver’s seat, climate control, remote monitoring and vehicle diagnostics and over-the-air updates. Seating capacity is limited to three – one for the driver and a bench seat at the back suitable for a child and an adult. Vayve Eva EV: battery specs, range The green vehicle promises a 250km range on a single charge, while the OEM claims an annual 3,000km mileage on solar energy. Additionally, a range of 50 kilometres can be achieved in five minutes by fast charging, while it takes 45 minutes to reach an 80 percent charge with a DC charger. With a standard charger, the time goes up to 4 hours. Eva’s liquid-cooled battery has a 14kWh capacity, as seen in the concept about two years ago. Powered by a 40Nm RWD motor, the Eva EV sprints from 0-40kph in 5 seconds, maxing out at a top speed of 70kph. The battery unit, placed under the floor, has a waterproof rating of IP68; other safety bits include a driver airbag and seatbelts for all three passengers. Vayve Eva EV: running costs Vayve claims that in comparison to regular petrol cars with an average running cost of Rs 5 per kilometre, Eva costs Rs 0.5 for every kilometre (90 percent less) it runs. This is made possible owing to the usage of lightweight materials in its construction, it says.
