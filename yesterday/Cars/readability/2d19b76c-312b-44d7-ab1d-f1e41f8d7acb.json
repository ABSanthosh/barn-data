That makes it the perfect choice for YouTubers to take to Moab or shoot to see how bulletproof it really is. After eight months, YouTuber JerryRigEverything has put about 13,000 miles in the Cybertruck, and as it turns out, there are some downsides to owning an incEl Camino.Suggested ReadingTesla's Cybertruck Has Finally ArrivedOffEnglishSuggested ReadingTo be fair to the Cybertruck, he does have some nice things to say about it. Over the course of about 30 seconds, he rattles off three things he likes: the fact that the sides really can stop a 9-mm bullet, how much attention it gets (even though he acknowledges that’s a double-edged sword, especially if you use it as a company truck), and the steer-by-wire system. Sure, Infiniti introduced steer-by-wire a decade ago, but he’s still allowed to like it. Less than a minute into the nearly eight-minute video, though, he gets into the stuff he doesn’t like about the Cybertruck, starting with the observation that two of the three Cybertrucks he’s driven had a loose bolt connecting the door to the body. That’s something you can tighten yourself, but at the same time, it’s a brand-new truck. You shouldn’t have to tighten anything even a year after you buy it. He also wasn’t thrilled with many of the recalls, but at least the backup camera that stopped working could be fixed with an over-the-air update. Trim pieces falling off is a much bigger deal and can’t be fixed with software. Oh, and don’t forget about the accelerator pedal that could get stuck and cause unintended acceleration. That’s kind of a big deal, but you can rest easy now that they’ve fixed it with a new screw. It also says a lot that he followed the part about Tesla not having replacement motors for the ones that need replacing with the line, “Personally, I think the larger recalls are still to come.”The lip in the bodywork just below the headlights also causes snow to accumulate in front, making the lights much less effective in winter. Also, as someone who actually tows regularly, the three Cybertrucks that have reportedly lost their rear bumpers so far doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence when it comes to both towing and crash safety. He even says he stopped towing with the Cybertruck because of it. Using his Cybertruck as a mobile billboard for his non-YouTube business also comes with a downside of its own. Yes, you’ll get a lot of eyes on your truck, but even Mr. Rig understands you can’t separate Elon from the Cybertruck. You, personally, may not be an advocate for ethnic cleansing or supportive of Elon’s offer to impregnate Taylor Swift, but there’s no way for other people to know that. Not only will he likely be replacing the Cybertruck with a Silverado EV, but when the sponsor that was originally supposed to be featured in the video realized it was about the Cybertruck, it backed out, saying, “We would rather not be featured alongside Cybertruck content at this time.”",
