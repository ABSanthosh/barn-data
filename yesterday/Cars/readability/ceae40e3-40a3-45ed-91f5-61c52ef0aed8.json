The car features a retractable hardtop with an electrochromic roof panel, and the body is finished in MSO Tokyo Cyan. Power comes from a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 mated to an Axial Flux electric motor and an eight-speed dual-clutch transaxle, and the interior is trimmed in black Alcantara with orange accents. The Performance Spec, a $9,400 option, was specified, and additional equipment includes the Technology and Driving Assistant Packs as well as a 7.4-kWh lithium-ion battery, a sports exhaust system, a front-axle lift system, a carbon-fiber rear spoiler, super-lightweight forged alloy wheels, carbon-ceramic brake rotors, carbon-fiber interior trim, a Bowers \u0026 Wilkins sound system, adaptive cruise control, and ClubSport seats. This McLaren Artura Spider is now offered in New York by the seller on behalf of the owner with a window sticker, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title in the name of the owner’s LLC. The Artura was launched in 2022 as the successor to the 570S, and is the first model to be built on the automaker’s monocoque McLaren Carbon Lightweight Architecture. The Spider model followed in 2025 and is highlighted by a retractable one-piece hardtop, which can be remotely operated via the key fob. This example is finished in the MSO shade of Tokyo Cyan and features an electrochromic roof panel, glazed rear buttresses, a carbon-fiber rear spoiler, adaptive LED headlights, dihedral doors, and a black engine cover. The car was also optioned with the Black Pack, which added gloss black side mirror housings, front fender louvers, and rear deck inlets as well as stealth black exhaust finishers that exit through the rear grille. The seller notes that paint protection film has been applied to the front portion of the car. Black 10-spoke 19″ and 20″ super-lightweight Dynamo forged alloy wheels are mounted with 235/35 front and 295/35 rear Pirelli P Zero tires. The Artura Spider featured damping- and handling-response rates that were increased by 90% over the contemporary coupe, and this car is also equipped with a front-axle lift system, cross-drilled carbon-ceramic brake rotors, brake calipers finished in McLaren Orange, McLaren Active Damping with multiple drive modes, and a double-wishbone independent suspension. The interior is wrapped in Graphite and Jet Black Alcantara, and the ClubSport seats feature lumbar adjustment along with Vision Orange piping that extends to the dash and door panels. Amenities include carbon-fiber interior trim and door sills, a 360-degree park assist system, McLaren Orange seatbelts, dual-zone climate control, a wireless phone charger, ambient lighting, and a Bowers \u0026 Wilkins sound system linked to a touchscreen infotainment system with navigation and Bluetooth connectivity. The Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel fronts a configurable LCD screen that displays vehicle speed, engine RPM, and other telemetric data. The digital odometer indicates 136 miles. The car was also optioned with the Driving Assistant Pack, which added blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, and rear cross-traffic detection. The mid-mounted twin-turbocharged 3.0L M630 V6 is paired with an Axial Flux electric motor and a 7.4-kWh lithium-ion battery that combine for a factory-rated output of 690 horsepower and 531 lb-ft of torque. The car can travel up to 21 miles on electric power alone. Power is sent to the rear wheels via an eight-speed dual-clutch transaxle, which was revised for use in the Artura Spider to provide roughly 25% faster shifts in comparison to the contemporary coupe. The car was optioned with a sports exhaust system. The window sticker shows standard and optional equipment, initial delivery to McLaren Philadelphia, and a total suggested retail price of $360,358. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage, and it lists registration history in Montana. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
