  "text": "The homemade Cybercop took four months to build and is now being sold for charity 2 hours ago by Thanos Pappas A 2004 Toyota was turned into a Cybertruck-style police car parody called the Cybercop. It features aluminum panels, LEDs, and fake weapons while retaining the original hardware. The one-off is listed on eBay in a charity auction supporting families of fallen officers. Every so often, the web delivers a custom build so strange, so wonderfully offbeat, you can’t help but stop scrolling. The Tesla Cybertruck has sparked plenty of imitation and parody since it first rolled onto the scene, but one Utah man might’ve created the most attention-grabbing tribute yet. The “Cybercop” (yes, really) is a heavily modified Toyota Prius that looks like it wandered off the set of a RoboCop reboot and got lost somewhere in the Utah desert. More: Meet The Toyota Supra Desperate To Be A Lamborghini Reventon The creator is Johnny Lange, who runs a specialty vehicle transportation business. His goal? To mock the Cybertruck’s over-the-top styling without spending Tesla-level money. The starting point was a humble 2004 Toyota Prius with over 200,000 miles, still running strong enough to carry the weight of its future metal costume. Square Tubes, Sheet Metal, and Some Humor After removing the bumpers, hood, and a few other pieces from the second-gen Prius, Johnny got to work building an angular exoskeleton out of square steel tubing to mimic the Cybertruck’s silhouette. Once the frame was in place, he attached flat aluminum panels using a mix of double-sided tape and rivets, a fastening strategy that lands somewhere between DIY necessity and mad scientist genius. Now that the build is finished, Toyota’s hybrid is nearly unrecognizable. Aside from the mirrors and glass, very little remains of the original exterior. Slim LED light strips took the place of standard headlamps and taillights, and the build rolls on black aftermarket alloys that make it look just edgy enough for a dystopian patrol route. eBay For the finishing touches, the Cybercop was dressed in a brushed metal wrap and outfitted with roof-mounted strobes, extra LEDs, fake weaponry, and a comically small push bar to complete its police-inspired costume. The livery leans into the joke, with “Space Patrol” decals along the sides and “Not A Cop Car” plastered on both ends, just enough to keep nervous glances at bay while still turning heads. More: Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR Replica Is A Lot More Than A Chopped E-Class Despite its futuristic costume, the interior hasn’t been touched. Open the door and you’re met with a completely stock Prius cabin. Onlyh the headrests have been modified with alien-style masks, so there’s at least some commitment to the theme (no aliens at Robocop, but we’ll let it slide – ed). At the back, a split tailgate offers access to the cargo area, while the rear doors are blocked. Mechanically, nothing has changed, apart from a set of spacers that widen the stance just a bit. ebay The Cybercop is currently up for auction on eBay with no reserve, and all proceeds will go to Utah’s 10-33 Foundation, a nonprofit that supports families of fallen officers. According to the listing, Johnny spent four months bringing the project to life, turning what could’ve been a simple parody into something unexpectedly meaningful. Lange, who goes by @utahjohnnyl on Instagram, has an eclectic garage that includes a Pontiac Trans Am, a custom GMC A-Team van, a Ferrari F430, a Lexus LC 500, a Toyota Land Cruiser, a Toyota Tacoma, a Chevy Silverado, and an E31 BMW 8-Series. In other words, this isn’t his first custom car rodeo. You can check out a video montage of the Cybercop’s build process and see it in action below.",
