  "description": "The crossover joins the larger 7 as the second car in Chery-owned Jaecoo's line-up; will get ICE and EV variants The Range Rover Evoque-rivalling Jaecoo 5 will go on sale this summer, priced from £24,505. The 5 will become the second model in the Chery-owned brand’s UK range following the popular 7, which has amassed 8399 sales so far this year. At launch, the 5 will be powered by a 145bhp 1.6-litre turbocharged petrol engine. Details on the EV variant will follow in the “coming weeks”. Visually, the Jaecoo 5 is a shrunken version of the 7, with near-identical front and rear end designs, but with a shorter wheelbase and a more raked roofline.   The entry-level 5 comes with a 13.2in vertical touchscreen, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and all-round parking cameras.  The 5 will be sold in two trim levels: Pure and Luxury. Entry-level equipment includes a six-speaker audio system, six-way adjustable seats, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. For £28,000, Luxury trim adds a panoramic roof, wireless phone charging, and heated and ventilated front seats.",
