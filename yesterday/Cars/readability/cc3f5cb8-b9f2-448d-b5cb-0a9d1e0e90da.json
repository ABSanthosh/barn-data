  "text": "These luxury Mercedes sedans debuted a decade ago with starting prices over $110,000. It’s now possible to find a twin-turbo V8-powered S550 in good condition for under $20,000. Buyers should budget enough cash to handle any expensive repairs that might be needed. Ever since its inception, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class has been the gold standard for luxury sedans, and the sixth-generation model, also known as the W222, known as the W222 and built between 2013 and 2020, is one of the finest iterations ever. It took rivals years to come close to matching the car’s fabulous interior, and despite how impressive it is, values of used W222 S-Class models have collapsed over the past couple of years, meaning it’s now an absolute bargain. Sitting at the base of the early, pre-facelift W222 S-Class range was the S550, equipped with a 4.7-liter twin-turbocharged V8 with 449 hp and 516 lb-ft (700 Nm) of torque. At its launch, prices started at around $110,000, before you even considered ticking any option boxes. Fast forward 10 years, and it’s now possible to pick up the keys to an excellent S550 for less than $20,000. Read: Bespoke Mercedes-Maybach S680 Is Basically A Land Yacht To put that into perspective, a 2025 Corolla sedan starts at $22,325 (or $23,935 including destination, but before taxes), while America’s cheapest new car, the Nissan Versa, starts at $17,190 ($18,330 with delivery for the manual or $20,130 with the automatic CVT). Deals Are Abundant A browse through popular auction sites like Cars \u0026 Bids and Bring a Trailer, as well as Edmunds, shows a dizzying number of S550s available for between $15,000 and $25,000. In late November, Cars \u0026 Bids sold a nice example painted in Obsidian Black with 92,100 miles (~148,000 km) on the clock. It fetched $18,450. The same month, a Ruby Black S550 sold for just $16,500, having covered 142,700 miles (~229,000 km). Recent results from Bring a Trailer show that some lower-mileage S550s from this era are selling for nearer the $30,000 mark, but still, that’s less than a third of the car’s original value. Jump onto a used car site like Edmunds, and you will find well over 100 W222 S-Classes looking for new homes across the United States. The single most expensive example on the platform is a 2014 Mercedes S550 driven just 10,275 miles (~16,500 km) and an asking price of $41,998. An S-Class For Less Than $15k? At the other end of the spectrum are dozens below $20,000. The cheapest is $14,900, although it’s been driven 156,450 miles (~251,000 km) and has previously been involved in an accident. A particularly compelling Diamond White Metallic car caught our eye in Decatur, Georgia. It has a clean ownership history, has been driven 100,000 miles (~160,000 km), and is listed for just $17,900. That’s only $1,205 more than the cheapest new car on sale in the US, the 2024 Mitsubishi Mirage. But Luxury Comes at a Cost Surely, a top-tier luxury sedan, with all the amenities, comfort and cache of the S-Class that can had for such an accessible price is a serious temptation. Yes, that Corolla will be brand spanking new and come with a warranty, but come on, almost everyone would be at least interested to take a closer look to Mercedes’ flagship, high-mileage or not. It’s a luxury item, and while no one really needs it, many want it for the qualities it offers and, let’s be honest, what it stands for. And, with fear of stating the obvious, that’s the point of luxury items in the first place. Or else we’d all be driving around in perfectly fine Corollas, Civics and the like, while companies like Mercedes, Ferrari etc. would have gone bankrupt a long time ago. But that’s certainly not the case now, is it? Greed, lust and pride may be deadly sins, but we’re only human, and companies bet on that – and they are thriving. Be Careful What You Wish For However, as attractive as it might seem to fork out a reasonable amount for money for an S-Class, it’s worth remembering that these were originally $100k cars and should be treated as such. Which means that they can (and in all likelihood will) be exorbitantly expensive to repair if anything goes wrong. And at some point, as is the case with practically all cars, something will. As such, prospective buyers would be wise to have any used S550 checked over by experienced mechanics before purchasing and put aside several thousand dollars in case of repairs. So, browse the ads all you like, maybe even narrow down your choices to ones that seem more appealing to you, but if you feel you absolutely must have one, proceed with extra care. You have been warned… This Mercedes-Benz S550 recently sold for $16,500 on Cars \u0026 Bids (Photos)",
