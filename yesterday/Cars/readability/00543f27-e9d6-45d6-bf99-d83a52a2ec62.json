  "text": "The alleged thief sent at least one message including a selfie of himself and the wheels 1 hour ago by Stephen Rivers Police say a 22-year-old stole multiple sets of wheels from a Connecticut dealership. He allegedly sent a selfie with stolen wheels in the background, bragging to friends. The man is now facing several charges and has been released on a $150,000 bond. As car prices continue to climb, it’s hardly surprising that criminals are taking note. In some cases, they’re targeting parts rather than the cars themselves. This appears to be the case with 22-year-old Brandon Sullo, who police say targeted tires in Connecticut. He’s accused of stealing several sets of wheels and then making the mistake of handing over irrefutable evidence of his crime to others. Back in October of 2024, police arrived at a Sullivan Honda dealership in Torrington, CT, investigating a suspicious person. When they arrived, whoever had narrowly escaped and even glanced off a police car with their getaway vehicle. Officers tracked the registration of the car back to Sullo. More: 900 Kia Engines Were Stolen Over 5 Years Without Anyone Noticing A week later, police obtained a search warrant for the Honda Accord involved in the incident. Inside the vehicle, they found a jack, an impact gun, and several wrenches. This led them to seize the cell phone of an unnamed accomplice they believe assisted Sullo. In that phone, they found a selfie taken and sent by the suspect showing multiple tires in the car with him. The photo was taken the same day as one of the suspected robberies, and Sullo had captioned it, “Coming back from Torrington.” Naturally, that just happened to be the site of the theft. As such, they charged him with first-degree larceny, three counts of second-degree larceny, and conspiracy to commit larceny in the first and second degree. Between October 7 and November 23, police believe he stole wheels and tires from cars at both Sullivan Honda and Toyota of Westport. According to CTInsider, authorities have video that places Sullo in both locations. The suspect turned himself in on April 14 and then posted a $150,000 bond before getting turned over to a different police department on separate charges. He has an arraignment on May 5, and police believe they’ll make at least one more arrest in connection with his case. Crime never pays, but doing crime and then documenting evidence against oneself seems especially debt-inducing.",
