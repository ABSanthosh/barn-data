  "description": "The Q7 was the Q that gave Audi India their big break. It established the brand and has since been a trusty badge if you want a big, luxury 7-seater SUV. However, competition has never been more cut-throat, so the Q7 has received another makeover to keep it relevant. Audi Q7 exterior and design It still gets the recognisable face with the wide grille and sharp lines, but look closer and you will spot small vertical chrome elements on the grille giving it a bejeweled look, the Matrix LED headlamps are even more intricate, and the bumpers are sportier and feature ducts and faux metal panels. Over to the side, the wheels are upsized from 19 inchers to 20 inchers, but the silhouette and lines are the same. Dimensionally, too, there is no change. So, the 3,000mm wheelbase and 5-metre-plus length continue to offer a strong road presence. At the rear, the LED tail-lamps get new detailing and the bumpers are redesigned. Trapezoidal exhaust tips complete the look and the Q7 continues to flaunt the serious, no-nonsense look. Audi Q7 interior, features and space Inside, there is a new dark, open-pore wood panel on the dashboard and door pads. Barring that though, you’d be lost trying to explain the new bits. However, while things may not be new, the quality levels are exceptional, and it's something we have always loved about the Q7. The dual-screen setup, with its click-based interface isn’t all too modern, but the resolution is crisp. We would have also liked wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Other modern amenities that one would expect in a luxury SUV like ventilated seats, wireless connectivity and ADAS are missing, too. The Q7 does get lane keep assist, but a full ADAS suite would have sweetened the deal. The front seats are hugely comfy and supportive. You can easily spend long hours in the driver's seat. Middle-row space is impressive even for passengers over six feet. The seats can also be adjusted for length, thereby adding more legroom or aiding more space for the third-row passengers. You get four-zone climate control with vents in the centre console and B-pillars, manual sunblinds, and a panoramic sunroof big enough to be enjoyed by rear-seat passengers without any compromise. The third row is best suited for children or short adults on short drives. But you do miss AC vents and it can get a bit stuffy. Best then to electronically flip down the third row and use it as a massive boot. Now, while space isn’t a concern, what might have some buyers alarmed is the spare wheel, or the lack thereof. You only get a puncture repair kit, and since the tyres are not run-flats, you need to be extra cautious. Audi Q7 engine, performance, gearbox Powering the Q7 is a lovely 3.0-litre, 340hp turbo-petrol V6 engine. Refinement is simply excellent and this Q7, despite being a big and heavy luxury SUV, is rapid! 0-100kph is a quick 5.6 seconds and there is also a raspy exhaust note as you get closer to the redline. Mated to the engine is an 8-speed automatic gearbox that shifts without a fuss. It is quick, has impressive kickdown times and is enjoyable to use. The engine thrums along at 100kph at just a shade over 1,500rpm and the Q7 can munch on the kilometres happily. Audi Q7 ride, comfort, handling While the engine and gearbox are the perfect partners, they are slightly pulled back by the suspension. The Q7 gets adaptive air suspension, but for the more balanced ‘Comfort’ mode, they have kept it on the softer side. As a result there is a fair amount of vertical movement inside the cabin over undulations. The car even nose-dives under braking. A cheat code to counter this is to use the drive modes, and more specifically, the Individual mode. In this mode, you can set the engine and gearbox to be at a relaxed setting that suits the highways, but switch the suspension setting to ‘Dynamic’ that tightens the setup. This ensures you have less pitching and the SUV's more sure-footed. Where the soft setup makes up though is over bad roads, where it absorbs the harsh shocks and thuds that make their way inside. Handling is nothing to boast of, but it's as you'd expect from a big luxury SUV like this. The quattro system ensures there is grip at all times, but there is so much mass moving at such a high speed, it will understeer if you push it. Audi Q7 price and verdict Prices for the updated Q7 start from Rs 88 lakh and this top-spec Technology trim is priced at Rs 97 lakh (ex-showroom, India). This variant goes up against the Mercedes-Benz GLE and the BMW X5, both of which have moved much ahead in terms of modernity. What will be of interest to buyers then, is the lower-spec model that makes for a good value proposition. The ride is comfy, the space and quality is top-level and the V6 is butter smooth. It's a comfy cruiser for those who want to be chauffeured around with little fuss. Also see:    Audi Q7 facelift launched at Rs 88.66 lakh Audi Q7 facelift video review",
