  "description": "The all-electric Rimac Nevera R has smashed a whopping two dozen new world records for acceleration and braking, claimed the Croatia-headquartered hypercar brand. Ranging between the fastest 0-100kph and 0-400-0kph times recorded by a production EV, the Nevera R set these feats at the Automotive Testing Papenburg proving ground in Germany from July 5-8. For reference, the standard Rimac Nevera had 23 records to itself, all of which, except one, were bettered by the even more extreme R. The Rimac Nevera R takes just 1.72 seconds to go from 0-100kph It makes a total of 2,017hp, 103hp more than the standard Nevera \"When we first introduced Nevera, it almost seemed like the pinnacle of hypercar performance had been reached...In a single generation, we had created a performance jump that previously would have taken decades. But now, through relentless innovation, Nevera R goes even faster. Breaking records is in our DNA, and we won't stop here,\" stated founder and CEO Mate Rimac.
