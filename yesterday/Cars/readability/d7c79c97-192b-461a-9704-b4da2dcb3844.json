The latest unveiling also gives us a first look at Hyundai’s new ‘Art of Steel’ design language.Hyundai INITIUM hydrogen FCEV is a first look at new design languageHyundai’s grand reveal of the INITIUM hydrogen FCEV concept gave us more than a look at the Korean automaker’s latest advances in hydrogen technology. It also gives us a first look at the new ‘Art of Steel’ design language, which focuses on Hyundai’s customer-centric approach to vehicle design.The INITIUM concept and ‘Art of Steel’ design language go hand-in-hand, with bold lines and a solid structure. Designed for both city and off-road capability, the hydrogen FCEV rides on 21-inch wheels and boasts a roof rack.Hyundai INITIUM Hydrogen FCEVHyundaiThose large aerodynamic wheels aid the INITIUM in achieving a 400-mile range. Other advances in Hyundai’s hydrogen technology include an electric motor with a maximum output of 150 kW. The hydrogen fuel cell can also provide electricity to appliances and devices by connecting the model to a 220V outlet.Inside, the hydrogen FCEV features a spacious interior with an unprecedented level of versatility. Reclining second-row seats offer increased comfort, while a large rear-door opening angle makes it easier to enter and exit the vehicle. Taking a page from battery-electric models, the INITIUM includes a routing planner that makes it easier to find refueling stations on the road.The Hyundai INITIUM will head into production during the first half of 2025.Hydrogen FCEV won’t replace electricWhile hydrogen may be a cleaner fuel source, only producing water as an emission, they’re prohibitively expensive and come with their own risks. For example, hydrogen must be stored at very high pressure and disperses rapidly in the event of a leak. Notably, hydrogen also burns in the form of an invisible flame, making it hard to handle leaks without special equipment.Hyundai INITIUM Hydrogen FCEVHyundaiHydrogen FCEVs, while mass produced for over a decade, don’t have much infrastructure available. Electric vehicles, however, have thousands upon thousands of charging stations setup in the United States, let alone throughout the rest of the world.While Hyundai is reinforcing its commitment to hydrogen, the Korean automaker is still investing in its battery-electric Ioniq line. The Hyundai Ioniq 9, a three-row electric SUV, is expected to be the next addition to the automaker’s electric offerings.“We are dedicated to pioneering a future where hydrogen is used by everyone, in everything, and everywhere. We invite you to join us on this journey,” said Jaehoon Chang, President and CEO of Hyundai.Hyundai’s hydrogen prowess dates back over a decadeAlthough Hyundai has more than 25 years in the hydrogen game, the automaker first entered the hydrogen segment in 2013 with the ix35 FCEV, also known as the Tucson FCEV. The first of its kind to ever be mass produced and sold around the world, the ix35 offered 134 horsepower and a range of 369 miles. Production of the Korean brand’s first mass-produced hydrogen FCEV ceased following the 2018 model year.Prior to the ix35, Hyundai developed the Tucson FCEV test model back in 2005. That concept model featured a 186-mile range and made its official debut at the 2005 Los Angeles Auto Show.Today, the Hyundai Nexo serves as the brand’s mass-produced FCEV flagship model. Production of the Nexo began in 2018 for the 2019 model year. The Hyundai Nexo Blue features a 350-mile range with three fuel tanks, a major improvement over the ix35.Final thoughtsWhile it’s unlikely hydrogen FCEVs will replace battery-powered electric vehicles anytime soon, development of hydrogen vehicles could lead to innovation in other parts of the automotive industry. The INITIUM concept is a good first look at what Hyundai may have planned for the future design of its other gas and electric vehicles.",
