And that’s exactly what the Kawasaki KZ750 LTD was. Known as the Z750B in Europe, and sometimes referred to as the Z750 Special, it had a smaller rear wheel, higher handlebars, and a more curvaceous seat than the standard KZ750.

Go even deeper, and you’ll find the mythical KZ750 LTD. It was common practice in the late 70s and early 80s for Japanese brands to release special versions of their bikes with cruiser underpinnings. And that’s exactly what the Kawasaki KZ750 LTD was. Known as the Z750B in Europe, and sometimes referred to as the Z750 Special, it had a smaller rear wheel, higher handlebars, and a more curvaceous seat than the standard KZ750. Those features were at odds with the plans Sylwester Mateusiak had for the 1980-model KZ750 LTD, though. Sylwester runs the Polish custom shop Eastern Spirit Motorcycles, which has a knack for creating custom bikes that somehow feel both raw and refined. Eastern Spirit started the project over a decade ago, but the forlorn KZ750 LTD was constantly shelved to make space for other jobs. It was only recently that Sylwester decided to drag it back onto the slab and give it the attention it deserved. And we’re glad he did. The idea was to build a scrambler that could bop around the city as well as it could blast down fire roads. That meant that all the KZ750 LTD’s bodywork had to be tossed, along with its subframe. And it meant that the Kawasaki’s laid-back geometry had to be radically revised. New suspension and wheels were key to sorting out the KZ750’s stance. The upside-down Kayaba forks were lifted from a KTM LC4 Enduro, refurbished, and fitted to the KZ. The rear shocks came from the Polish suspension specialists Sanchez, and were tailored to this project. Eastern Spirit also ditched the bike’s OEM alloy hoops, fitting the 21F/18R wheels from a Yamaha XT-series bike instead. There’s a drum brake out back, with a Nissin caliper and floating disc from a Honda VFR750 up front. Dual-sport tires from Michelin (front) and Mitas (rear) offer a balance of on- and off-road capability. With the bike now standing tall, Eastern Spirit fabricated a custom subframe to create a cleaner line across the top. It terminates in a kicked-up loop, sitting above an abbreviated rear fender. The rear fender is a bespoke aluminum part, as are the front fender, headlight nacelle, and sump guard. Each part is perfectly proportioned, which is probably why Sylwester didn’t apply any paint. A solo seat with suave tan upholstery completes the set. Stunning details abound. The fuel tank includes a housing for a fuel gauge, secured with a brass ring. The headlight is mounted on elegant handmade brackets, while the taillight sits on a strut attached to the swingarm. The scrambler-style bars sport a custom brace with bronze brazing at the joints. A Daytona speedo sits off to the side, with a set of LED warning lights tucked against the bar risers. Going deeper, Eastern Spirit stripped the engine, replaced anything that wasn’t in tip-top shape, and rebuilt it. It looks as good as new, with fresh paint and thoughtful brass details. The shop saw to the wiring too, with a scratch-built wiring harness. No scrambler is complete without an appropriate exhaust system, and Sylwester knocked this one out of the park. Twin headers snake around the engine, running along the left-hand side of the bike and terminating in a pair of conical silencers. A pair of custom-made heat shields keep the rider’s leg safe. Eastern Spirit’s Kawasaki KZ750 scrambler is finished off with a removable luggage rack, plus space to mount two Rotopax tanks (one for fuel and one for water). So not only is it sleek and stylish, but it’s ready to munch miles too. Eastern Spirit Instagram | Images by Mateusz Stankiewicz",

It looks as good as new, with fresh paint and thoughtful brass details. The shop saw to the wiring too, with a scratch-built wiring harness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kawasaki-kz750-scrambler-4-745x497.jpg\" alt=\"Kawasaki KZ750 scrambler by Easter Spirit, Poland\" width=\"745\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kawasaki-kz750-scrambler-4-745x497.jpg 745w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kawasaki-kz750-scrambler-4-420x280.jpg 420w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kawasaki-kz750-scrambler-4-180x120.jpg 180w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kawasaki-kz750-scrambler-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kawasaki-kz750-scrambler-4-570x380.jpg 570w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kawasaki-kz750-scrambler-4-135x90.jpg 135w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kawasaki-kz750-scrambler-4-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kawasaki-kz750-scrambler-4-258x172.jpg 258w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kawasaki-kz750-scrambler-4-360x240.jpg 360w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kawasaki-kz750-scrambler-4-720x480.jpg 720w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kawasaki-kz750-scrambler-4-275x183.jpg 275w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kawasaki-kz750-scrambler-4-150x100.jpg 150w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kawasaki-kz750-scrambler-4.jpg 1490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\"/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\nNo scrambler is complete without an appropriate exhaust system, and Sylwester knocked this one out of the park.
