Drivers in Dearborn Heights, Michigan woke up to find their cars covered in thick ice. They aren’t the only ones dealing with this intense cold weather situation either. Cold weather can be incredibly tough on cars. What’s even worse, though, is when nature combines sub-zero temperatures with freezing water. Over the last few days, car owners in various states have woken up to find their vehicles completely frozen. And we’re not just talking about the chill—they’re stuck under a thick layer of ice, making them look like gigantic ice sculptures.” Most notably, the community of Dearborn Heights, in Michigan just dealt with the aftermath of a broken water main. As temperatures plummeted, a main broke and spewed water all over several cars on Monroe Street. The vehicles affected ended up with heavy and thick layers of ice all over them. More: That Sunken And Frozen Rivian R1S Is Finally Free After Multiple Recovery Attempts To fix the issue, crews had to use heavy machinery to physically move the cars to a garage where they could chip away at some of the ice and slowly break it off. Authorities say to keep an eye out for this to happen again. Owners who have the ability to use remote start could warm up their car that way but moving it before it freezes over is, of course, optimal. In Chicago, several cars ended up stuck in a similar but less dramatic situation. It appears as though another water main broke but rather than spew water over the entire car, this time, the water simply pooled around the wheels. Nevertheless, it froze in place, high up enough that it covered the lower portion of the rims, and stuck the cars in place as well. As winter presses on it’s important to be thoughtful about parking situations. Over the past few years, some who have parked next to bodies of water have come back to their car only to find it frozen over as well. That kind of cold can do damage to some components too. No doubt, diligence is needed during such chilly times. Image Credit: Click On Detroit",
