Finished in Signal Red over black leather, the car is equipped with a black soft top, a soft top boot, sealed-beam open headlights, 15″ wire-spoke steel wheels, power-assisted disc brakes, triple windshield wipers, an AM/FM radio, and a heater. The current owner purchased the car in 2019, and the engine was rebuilt in June 2021. This XKE Series 1.5 roadster is now offered on dealer consignment with a Jaguar Heritage Trust Certificate, service invoices, and a clean Colorado title. The Series 1.5 E-Types featured exposed headlights shared with Series II cars but retained Series I equipment such as a small front grille opening, turn signals mounted above the front bumper, and taillights situated above the split rear bumper. This example came finished from the factory in Signal Red and was repainted under prior ownership. Additional equipment includes a black soft top, a soft top boot, sealed-beam open headlights, a louvered clamshell hood, wraparound chrome bumpers, a driver-side mirror, triple windshield wipers, and dual exhaust outlets. The 15″ wire wheels are secured by rounded knock-offs and are mounted with Vredestein Sprint Classic tires measuring 185HR15. Braking is provided by four-wheel discs with inboard-mounted rear rotors. The cabin was reupholstered under prior ownership and features bucket seats trimmed in black leather along with color-coordinated door panels and carpets. Interior appointments include three-point seatbelts, black vinyl dash trim, a sliding rearview mirror, a Blaupunkt AM/FM radio, and a heater. Replacement seat rails were installed under current ownership. Wear is present on the side of the driver’s seat, and the seller notes that the driver’s seat frame is bent and difficult to tilt forward or backwards. The wood-rimmed steering wheel frames a Smiths 160-mph speedometer and 6k-rpm tachometer, while auxiliary gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel level, and amperage are located in the center of the dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows 58k miles, approximately 1,400 of which were added under current ownership. The 4.2-liter inline-six was rebuilt in June 2012 and features dual Zenith-Stromberg carburetors that were overhauled in October 2022. Maintenance performed in preparation for the sale involved adjusting the throttle linkage and repairing the fuel pump. Invoices presented in the image gallery below detail the work performed. A photo of the engine stamping is viewable above. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a full-synchromesh four-speed manual transmission. The Jaguar Heritage Trust Production Record Trace certificate shows the original colors and drivetrain numbers as well as the build and dispatch dates. You are not connected to real-time updates.
