  "description": "The recently launched Creta Electric is the first Hyundai model to feature a locally assembled battery pack. The Creta Electric is available in two battery capacities: 42kWh and 51.4kWh. Hyundai and Mobis India Limited are assembling the batteries inside a new facility at the automaker’s Chennai plant.  Hyundai Motor India has attained 92 percent localisation in manufacturing The automaker plans to localise drivetrain and electronics, too The plant can assemble a diverse range of battery packs, including NMC (Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt Oxide) and LFP (Lithium-Iron-Phosphate) batteries and has an annual capacity of 75,000 units in phase 1. Localisation so far Hyundai Motor India Ltd’s whole-time director and chief manufacturing officer Gopalakrishnan Chathapuram Sivaramakrishnan (left) with managing director Unsoo Kim. Hyundai says the level of localisation in manufacturing is 92 percent. Key components like alloy wheels, disc brakes, catalytic converter, clutch assembly, alternator, shark fin antenna and reverse parking sensors have also been localised. Other parts include panoramic sunroof, TPMS, oil cooler and NOX sensors. Hyundai did so by sourcing 1,238 parts from over 194 vendors. Hyundai Creta Electric battery specs, charging, range The ARAI claimed range is 390km with the smaller 42kWh unit and 473km with the 51.4kWh battery pack; the motor output is 136hp and 171hp, respectively. With a 50kW DC fast charger, the 10-80 percent charge comes in 58 minutes (for both cells), and with an 11kW unit, it takes 4 hours for the smaller battery and 4.5 hours for the larger one.

Hyundai EV market share expectations, pricing strategy “For production volumes, we have developed an interchangeable production system, which lets us adapt to the market demand extremely fast. The Creta has always done well for us. Since Hyundai’s share in the overall ICE segment is 14-15 percent, we are targeting a similar market share with our EVs,” said Hyundai Motor India chief operating officer Tarun Garg. By 2030, the EV market’s cumulative 2.5 percent share can reach 17 percent, and the Creta may play a big role in that, he added. The Creta Electric’s introductory prices start at Rs 17.99 lakh, ex-showroom. Garg explained that the model benefits from Hyundai’s access to technology and volumes. “Plus, the battery localisation that we have been able to do also helps. We are looking to localise the drivetrain, electronics and battery manufacturing,” he noted.  Also, see: Hyundai India MD: Underestimated EV market, but not worried about catching up Hyundai Creta Electric to be followed by 3 made-in-India EVs",
