  "description": "The Bayon arrived in 2021 New model is expected to sit between Inster and Kona Electric and be twinned with Kia's upcoming EV2 Hyundai will reveal a electric crossover, likely an electric alternative to the Bayon, in \"the next few months\" as it pushes to expand its EV offerings. Understood by Autocar to be twinned with sibling brand Kia’s incoming EV2, the crossover will plug the gap between the incoming Inster and the Kona Electric. This size, thought to be near to that of the combustion-powered Bayon, will position it as a rival to the likes of the Renault 4 and Volvo EX30. It will be revealed “in the next few months”, new European CEO Xavier Martinet said, with a launch currently confirmed by Hyundai for the third quarter of 2026, meaning deliveries could begin as soon as next July. It is understood Kia’s EV2, previewed by the EV2 concept, will arrive a few months before it. “We are very much involved with the electrification of our line-up and to increase our electrified mix in the coming years,” said Martinet. Like the EV2, the car will be based on the same scalable E-GMP platform that is used by nearly all Hyundai Motor Group – Hyundai, Kia, Genesis – EVs. It's therefore likely to get a similar set-up to the slightly larger Kia EV3, which is offered with either a 58.3kWh or 81.4kWh battery pack offering ranges 267 and 372 miles respectively. All versions of the EV3 are powered by a single electric motor that sends 201bhp and 209lb ft through the front wheels. Inside, the new electric car will bring a “step change” in usability for Hyundai which includes a new infotainment system that, Autocar has been told, will allow for elements, such as ambient lighting and noise, to alter depending on driving modes or style. Like the incoming EV2, it is also expected to get the same combined instrument and infotainment display set-up, which spans roughly half the width of the dashboard. As eith the closely related Kia EV6 and Hyundai Ioniq 5, pricing for the new crossover will likely be close to the EV2, which has been pencilled to cost around €30,000 (£25,000). When it arrives next year, it will be the sixth electric car in Hyundai’s growing EV line-up, following the Ioniq 9 flagship that is due to hit UK roads in the coming months.",
