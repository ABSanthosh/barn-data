  "description": "This 1969 Ford Mustang is one of a claimed 17 produced as an officially licensed Boss 429 continuation by Classic Recreations. Each began with a 1969 Mustang body that was modified in the style of a Boss 429, while under the bodywork of this example a Jon Kaase Racing Engines 572ci “Boss Nine” V8 was installed and mated to a six-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters. A four-link rear suspension, tubular upper and lower front control arms, adjustable coilovers, and chassis reinforcements highlight the suspension modifications, and forged 18″ American Racing wheels were also installed along with Wilwood brakes, custom gauges, TMI high-back bucket seats, an aluminum steering wheel, air conditioning, a modern sound system, and a center console. This car is believed to be the only example delivered in this configuration with Laser Red paintwork, a custom interior, and an automatic transmission. This continuation Boss 429 was previously listed on BaT in December 2024 and is now offered again with a clean Oklahoma title in the seller’s name.",

This continuation Boss 429 was previously listed on BaT in December 2024 and is now offered again with a clean Oklahoma title in the seller’s name. Classic Recreations began with a 1969 Mustang coupe and refreshed the exterior with fastback Boss 429 details. The car has a hood scoop, quarter-panel scoops, a front spoiler, Boss 429 fender badges, and modern lighting. The bumpers were painted to match the exterior, which was specified in Laser Red. The car rides on a modified suspension with a four-link rear end, tubular upper and lower front control arms, front and rear sway bars, and adjustable coilovers. The chassis was reinforced, and the car also has power steering. The forged 18″ American Racing wheels are mounted with Michelin tires and cover Wilwood slotted-and cross-drilled rotors with six- and four-piston calipers front and rear, respectively. The rear was mini-tubbed. TMI front bucket seats were installed along with a custom center console, and the front occupants are secured by RJS harnesses. Air conditioning and a custom Focal sound system linked to a JVC CD stereo were also installed. The roll bar is cosmetic only. A Lecarra aluminum steering wheel is mounted on a Flaming River column and frames custom Classic Recreations gauges highlighted by a 200-mph speedometer and a 10k-rpm tachometer. The odometer reads 1,900 miles, which represents the distance driven since completion. The Kaase Racing Engines 572ci “Boss Nine” V8 has a 4340 steel crankshaft and connecting rods, Diamond forged pistons, aluminum cylinder heads, WW Engineering aluminum roller rockers, and a single-plane intake manifold. The Holley electronic fuel injection system is linked to a fuel cell mounted in the trunk. A Be Cool radiator and two electric cooling fans have also been installed along with a Concept One pulley system and MSD ignition. The 6R80 six-speed automatic transmission has paddle shifters and is linked to to a 9″ Fab9 rear axle with 3.50:1 gearing and limited-slip differential. The tubular headers are linked to a custom dual 3″ exhaust system with a crossover pipe and MagnaFlow mufflers with exits ahead of the rear axle. A copy of the build certificate and specifications are displayed in the gallery. The Oklahoma title carries a “classic” notation. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
