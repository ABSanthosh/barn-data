Complex wiring harnesses are a nightmare to navigate, and CAN bus systems limit what you can unplug without risking a bricked ECU. Luckily, the 2006 Triumph Scrambler sidesteps these modern afflictions. Triumph’s current crop of modern classics are liquid-cooled, ride-by-wire machines with rider aids and TFT screens. The older Triumph Scrambler is delightfully simple by comparison. You get a torquey, air-cooled parallel-twin, fed by twin carbs… and not much else. That makes it a fantastic base for stylish custom builds—like this Triumph Scrambler from Taiwan’s 2LOUD Custom. Known for blending eclectic flair with refined craftsmanship, 2LOUD’s approach suits the Scrambler perfectly. But before they could work their magic, the donor bike was in dire need of restoration. “Due to the rarity of the carburetor version of the Scrambler in Taiwan, the owner acquired it at a very high price,” explains 2LOUD founder Ma ‘Max’ Yicheng. “When the motorcycle was delivered to my shop, every part that could rust had rusted severely, and all the aluminum parts had oxidized to white. Even the engine’s clutch cover was dented and cracked.” Despite the dire condition of the donor bike, Max was undeterred. He repaired the clutch cover through some deft metalwork and welding, overhauled the motor, rebuilt the carbs, and cleaned up the frame. Every single fastener was replaced with a stainless steel item, along with the engine mounting bolts, wheel axles, swingarm axle, and even the footpeg pins. Next, Max rebuilt the OEM forks with new consumables and then polished them for a better-than-factory finish. Once the subframe had been shortened, the frame, swingarm, fork yokes, and a handful of smaller parts were all coated with a high-temperature metallic paint. The Scrambler’s stock wheel hubs were treated to the same finish, and then laced to new 19F/17R aluminum rims with stainless steel spokes. Pirelli Scorpion Rally STR tires were added for a sensible balance of on- and off-road performance, and Öhlins shocks were fitted to the rear. Max installed a fresh chain and sprockets, plus a svelte chain guard from 2LOUD’s burgeoning catalog of bolt-on parts. The brake discs are prototypes from a new range that Max is working on, 2SPEED. They’re gripped by an ISR caliper up front, and the original Triumph caliper at the back. Up top, Max took the Scrambler’s original fuel tank and modified it beyond the point of recognition. It’s narrower and shallower than before, with a flat edge along the bottom that gives it the appearance of being mounted higher. Max also welded elegant new mounting tabs on, and sunk a Motogadget speedo into the top of the tank. Aluminum fenders float above the wheels, each ending in a tidy ducktail. The front fender is held in place by a stainless steel bracket that also holds the headlight and front turn signals. The rear turn signals are attached to brackets on the upper shock mounts, and the taillight is another 2LOUD part. Max kept the Scrambler’s riding position laid back, pairing a set of wide 2LOUD handlebars with a contoured leather saddle that can accommodate two, in a pinch. The bars are fitted with CNC-machined controls from ISR in Sweden—as are the switches, which are integrated into the lever clamps. The ignition barrel has been relocated to the left-hand side of the bike. Max also rewired the bike, hid a tiny Shorai battery under the seat, and built custom stainless steel oil lines. He finished the build off with a stunning pair of stainless steel shotgun exhausts, repurposing the original heat shields as a nod to the original design. The Triumph’s paint job complements Max’s extensive mods tastefully. The tank and side covers look black, but they’re actually a very deep blue, and the fenders have been brushed and clear-coated. The end product is a no-frills scrambler that’s devoid of technological frou-frou and loaded with style. 2LOUD Custom | Facebook | Instagram",
