  "text": "The crossover model hasn't been approved yet, but a decision is expected later this year. 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Infiniti is getting closer to approving a new crossover based on the Nissan Rogue. A decision is expected later this year and, if green-lighted, the model could arrive in 2027. The crossover is expected to be electrified and could become the brand’s best-selling model. Acura recently launched an entry-level crossover based on the Honda HR-V and it appears Infiniti is planning something similar. In this case, they’re reportedly eyeing a new model based on the Nissan Rogue. Rumors about the crossover emerged last summer and Nissan reportedly teased it at a supplier meeting last month. According to a report from AutoNews, the model is internally known as the i33C and could arrive in late 2027. More: Infiniti Could Kill The QX50 And QX55, Offer Rebadged Nissan Rogue The company is staying tight-lipped, but a spokesperson confirmed “We are giving strong consideration to a new, electrified compact SUV for Infiniti as we look to expand the brand‘s lineup.” The publication says the company is currently working on a business case for the model and its fate is expected to be decided by the end of the year. Since the crossover hasn’t been approved yet, a number of details are still up in the air. However, it’s believed the model would be based on the next-generation Rogue and wouldn’t be a simple rebadge. There’s also speculation the crossover could offer a plug-in hybrid or e-Power system. If approved, the model could be built in Smyrna, Tennessee alongside the Rogue. This would help the crossover to avoid tariffs and some insiders reportedly believe the company could sell around 50,000 units annually. That would be a huge jump as Infiniti only sold 58,070 vehicles in the United States last year. Furthermore, if those estimates pan out, the crossover would likely become their best-selling vehicle in America as the QX60 only racked up 27,808 sales last year. It remains to be seen if the crossover will be approved, but Infiniti is in dire need of new vehicles. The Q50 was discontinued last year, while the US-spec QX50 and QX55 are slated to go out of production in December.",
