  "text": "Jun 13, 2025 9:00 PM EDTToyota flexes its hypercar creativity with the GR LH2 Toyota has unveiled its GR LH2 Racing Concept featuring a hydrogen engine paired with a hybrid system at the Circuit de la Sarthe days ahead of the iconic 24 Hours of Le Mans race. The GR LH2 is designed to advance the development of hydrogen tech in motorsports and mark the 40th anniversary of the automaker’s first Le Mans run. According to Toyota, the GR LH2 is based on its GR010 Hybrid Hypercar used in the World Endurance Championship, which includes the 24 Hours of Le Mans as its flagship event. While Toyota didn’t provide many details on the concept’s powertrain or hydrogen system, they were built at Japan’s Higashi-Fuji Technical Centre. The chassis, the same as in the GR010, was manufactured at Toyota’s Gazoo Racing facility in Cologne, Germany. Toyota’s GR LH2 is the GR H2 Concept’s successor, and distinguishes itself from its predecessor with new bodywork, such as remodeled side intakes, a taller rear wing, and a larger fin. The LH2 also differs from the GR H2 with its striking white-and-blue livery and smaller front LED lights, but its greenhouse resembles the previous concept. Official measurements for the LH2 are 5100mm (200.7 inches) in length and 2050mm (80.7 inches) in width. The minds behind Toyota’s GR LH2 Racing Concept “Toyota has been the pioneer for hydrogen combustion engine technology since 2021 in Super Taikyu racing in Japan,” said Kazuki Nakajima, former F1 driver and Team Director and Vice Chairman of Toyota Gazoo Racing Europe. Toyota’s sister team, Rookie Racing, participated in the Japanese Super Taikyu series in 2021 with a gaseous hydrogen-engine Corolla, before switching to a liquid hydrogen-powered car in 2023. In 2022, Toyota displayed the potential of hydrogen engines in rally racing with a GR Yaris H2 at the Ypres Rally in the FIA World Rally Championship. A year later, the hydrogen-engine Corolla completed a demonstration lap at Circuit de la Sarthe, and the GR H2 Racing Concept was showcased to preview a potential hydrogen category at Le Mans.  The GR H2 was a static concept, but the GR LH2 is a running test car. Nakajima noted that Toyota has been pushing to introduce hydrogen as energy while maintaining a racing engine’s noise, sensation, and vibration. Toyota Gazoo Racing endurance driver and team principal Kamui Kobayashi said Toyota’s performance division made the GR LH2 to highlight future carbon-neutral possibilities while enhancing its motorsport presence. Final thoughts Toyota’s decision to limit information released on the new GR LH2 could signal noteworthy progress on its hydrogen initiatives. Since 2021, Toyota has continually built on its hydrogen innovation in motorsport, and the GR LH2’s ability to function as a running test car is another significant step. Kamui Kobayashi, Nyck Devries, and Mike Conway will compete for Toyota Gazoo Racing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans’ Hypercar event from June 14 to 15. About the AuthorCody Carlson",
