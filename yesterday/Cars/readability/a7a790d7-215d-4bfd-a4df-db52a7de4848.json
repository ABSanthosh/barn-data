  "text": "We've found multiple dealers jacking up the price of the 2025 4Runner with many in California January 13, 2025 at 19:02 by Michael Gauthier Toyota dealers are adding markups of up to $5,000 on the new 4Runner. The model is supposed to start at $40,770 before a $1,450 destination fee. The new SUV comes with a 278 hp turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. Toyota’s sales satisfaction has been in the dumps lately and they recently ranked one point ahead of Mitsubishi. While a variety of factors go into this, Toyota dealers have gone crazy with markups. They’ve added an $11,000 markup to a Tacoma Trailhunter and a $4,995 adjustment for the 2025 Camry. There were also sizable markups on the Land Cruiser and GR Corolla. More: 2025 Toyota 4Runner Is The Tacoma Of SUVs And It’s Coming For The Bronco Given this trend, it’s not surprising to see greedy dealers adding thousands onto the price of the 2025 4Runner. One of the worst offenders is Stevens Creek Toyota of San Jose, California. Their 4Runner TRD Off-Road Premium has a sticker price of $60,083 but they’ve slapped a $4,995 “dealer price adjustment” on top of that. This increases the price to $65,078 which means it costs thousands more than a Land Cruiser. Things get even worse when you consider the 4Runner TRD Off-Road Premium starts at $54,970 before a $1,450 fee. That’s a sizable difference, but this particular variant has been loaded up with accessories such as all-weather floor liners, a cargo mat, mudguards, and black badges. Unfortunately, this isn’t the only example as Continental Toyota of Hodgkins, Illinois has their 4Runner TRD Sport listed for $55,782 despite carrying a $52,284 sticker. So what explains the $3,498 difference? An apparently mandatory “Premier Defense Protection Package.” That’s a lot of money for something customers probably don’t want, but it provides seven years of protection for the exterior and interior including “stains, rips, tears and burns.” Back in California, Ventura Toyota has a $5,000 markup on their 4Runner SR5. This equates to more than a 10% markup considering the MSRP is $48,247. The model has also been loaded up with accessories ranging from floor mats to side steps and a roof rack. On the bright side, most dealers appear to be offering their 4Runners at sticker price. However, your experience may vary so it pays to shop around.",
