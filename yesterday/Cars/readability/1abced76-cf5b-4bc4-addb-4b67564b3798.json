Equipment includes the Sport Chrono Package, an aftermarket exhaust system, front dive planes, carbon-fiber interior trim, red 19″ center-locking wheels, bi-xenon headlights, Dynamic Cornering Lights, an adjustable rear wing, RS graphics, carbon-fiber-backed seats, aluminum pedals, and automatic climate control. This 997.2 GT3 RS was purchased by the owner in 2023 and is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner in Georgia with a DME report, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title in the current owner’s name. The track-focused RS model features a carbon-fiber rear wing and wider quarter panels as well as model-specific side stripes and badging when compared to the standard 997 GT3. This example is finished in gray and has bi-xenon headlights, Dynamic Cornering Lights, fog lights, clear LED taillights, headlight washers, red graphics, front dive planes, and dual center-mounted exhaust outlets. Paint protection film has been applied to the front end, and photos of paint meter readings are provided in the gallery below. Red 19″ center-locking multi-spoke wheels are mounted with Michelin tires. Braking is handled by Porsche-branded six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers over rotors measuring 15″ and 13.8″ front and rear, respectively. The GT3 RS was factory equipped with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) featuring adjustable coilovers. The carbon-fiber-backed sport seats are upholstered in black leather and Alcantara with red seatbelts, and a roll cage has been fitted. Interior appointments include a CD stereo, aluminum pedals, carbon-fiber illuminated door sill guards, carbon-fiber trim, and automatic climate control. The Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel frames a central GT3-branded tachometer with an 8,400-rpm redline, a 225-mph speedometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The optional Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 10k miles, approximately 800 of which were added under current ownership. The 3.8-liter Mezger flat-six features VarioCam variable valve timing as well as titanium connecting rods and dry-sump lubrication. Factory-rated output was 450 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. An aftermarket exhaust system has been fitted. Results of a DME report are provided in the gallery. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
