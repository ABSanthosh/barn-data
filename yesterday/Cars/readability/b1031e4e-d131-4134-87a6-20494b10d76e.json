  "description": "At IBW 2024, KTM took the wraps off 2 India-bound models in the form of the 390 Adventure S and the 390 Enduro R. Technical specifications for both these bikes haven’t been revealed yet but we can make out a few things from here. 390 Adventure S gets cruise control, tubeless wheels Both bikes get adjustable suspension India launch for both is slated to happen in January Also See: KTM 390 Adventure S, 390 Enduro R image gallery KTM 390 Adventure S: what can be seen? The 390 Adventure S seen here is the middle variant in the range, sitting in between the top-spec R and the base X. Even so, it is very well-equipped. Three things that are particularly nice to see are the adjustable suspension units, cruise control and tubeless wire-spoked wheels.  The 390 Adventure S runs on a 21/17-inch wheel combination, shod with Apollo Tramplr dual-purpose tyres. Unlike the current 390 Adventure, the new 390 Adventure S uses an axially mounted front caliper and the brake disc has  We can also see that the 390 Adventure S is using the same 5-inch TFT display as the 390 Duke, although it is mounted a lot higher. It gets similar styling to the 390 Adventure R which was revealed at EICMA a couple months ago but the paint scheme is different here.  The launch of the new 390 Adventure models is slated to happen in January 2025, which is when we expect full details to trickle in.  KTM 390 Enduro R: most off-road capable 390 The 390 Enduro R is a focused off-roader based on KTM’s new 390 platform. It has very basic bodywork in keeping with its intended purpose. Like the Adventure S, the Enduro R also has a 21-inch front wheel but unlike that bike, it runs on an 18-inch rear. It is shod with Mitas block-pattern tyres, which are made by Reise in India. The Enduro R also gets adjustable suspension but the digital display is a very small one and even the switchgear is much more basic compared to the Adventure S. The Enduro R is also going to be launched alongside the 390 Adventure models in January.  Also See: KTM 390 Adventure S, 390 Enduro R walkaround video",
