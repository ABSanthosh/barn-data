  "text": "Here's the quickest and dumbest way to remove the front bumper of a McLaren supercar October 15, 2024 at 20:42 by Stephen Rivers A McLaren 600LT driver attempted, and failed, to show off leaving a Cars and Coffee meet. Instead of impressing the crowd, he got more attention than he bargained for after crashing. It appears as though the car will live to drive another day as the damage seems to be minimal. ACI Dynamix calls itself Connecticut’s “one-stop” automotive facility, and as such, it hosts a Cars and Coffee event from time to time. On September 29, a McLaren 600LT leaving the venue tried hard to show off to the crowd before things went very wrong. As a result, the owner will no doubt have an expensive repair bill. Hopefully, his ego is humbled a bit too. The single-vehicle crash happened late on the morning of September 29th. The McLaren driver was one of several who attempted to garner some attention leaving the parking lot at 132 Silvermine Rd, in Seymour, CT. Unlike all the rest of the cars though, the supercar didn’t make it very far without a crash. More: Driverless McLaren Can’t Stop Crashing Into Maybach GLS After turning onto the road, the driver revs the engine and rockets away but the tires struggle for traction. It appears as though the car tried to save the driver as it straightened out and things seemed to be back on track for a moment. The peace didn’t last though and soon the McLaren was up onto the curb and gathering leaves like a rake. Video from the scene shows fluids pouring out on the ground while the entire lower front bumper cover is gone. Surprisingly, the hood and nose of the 600LT look to be in undamaged condition. We only get a very brief look at them but the wheels and side skirt might have made it out without serious damage too. Notably, the 600LT driver wasn’t the only one to struggle with exiting the event. A BMW M3 nearly crashed as well and several drivers had a hard time gaining traction on the wet road. As is almost always the case in crashes like this, the lesson is clear. Don’t drive beyond one’s own skill level even if it’s to get attention. It might end up garnering the type one doesn’t want.
