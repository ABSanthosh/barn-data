  "description": "Honda will announce prices for the all-new Amaze compact sedan on December 4, just weeks after the launch of Maruti’s fourth-gen Dzire. Both models are unique to India and are staunch rivals in the compact sedan category. The Amaze will enter its third generation, replacing its predecessor that had gone on sale back in 2018. New Amaze to be petrol only initially Will be more feature-laden than before Expected to get Civic-like design cues New Honda Amaze: what all is known so far? Honda recently released a teaser of the third-gen Amaze and while it was partially dark, it did end up revealing some interesting bits about the car. The new Amaze will get a more angular and hunkered down look, at least from the front, thanks to slimmer headlamps with sharp edges on both corners. The grille is much larger and will feature a honeycomb pattern that is reminiscent of the latest Honda Civic for international markets. The tall front bumper gets large inlets at each corner that house the fog lamps. A wide air inlet is expected to be seen just below the grille, which will add to the car's muscular front styling. Asthe teaser shows, the new Amaze will get a thin chrome strip that runs right above the grille and merges neatly with the headlamps. While not much is known about the its side profile, rear, or even interior, spy shots of the new Amaze revealed a slightly angular but squarish profile for the third-gen sedan, hints at an evolution of the outgoing model's design.   The new Amaze will continue with the current 1.2-litre four cylinder petrol engine that comes mated to either a 5-speed manual or a CVT automatic. Sources tell us that there are plans for an Amaze CNG as well, which will go on sale a little later. As mentioned above, the new Amaze will rival the fourth-gen Dzire, which has upped the game in many areas, particularly with segment-first features like a sunroof and a 360-degree camera, along with sharper styling. While there isn’t much known about the new Amaze’s feature list, we expect Honda to equip its entry-level sedan competitively in the sub-four-metre sedan category, where the Hyundai Aura and the Tata Tigor also vie for attention.
