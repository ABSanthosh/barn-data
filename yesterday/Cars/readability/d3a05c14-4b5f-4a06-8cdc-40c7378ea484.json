The Spider 16M is finished in Rosso Corsa with a center Livrea Tricolore stripe over Nero Alcantara and patterned cloth and is powered by a 4.3-liter DOHC V8 paired with a six-speed F1 automated transaxle. Further equipment includes a black convertible soft top, 19″ five-spoke alloy wheels, an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, Brembo carbon-ceramic brake rotors, carbon-fiber fender shields, carbon-fiber-framed seats, and automatic climate control. An April 2024 major service totaling over $44k included replacing the F1 hydraulic actuators, accumulators, pumps, and relays in addition to the gearbox ECU, rear main seal, and more. This F430 Scuderia Spider 16M is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with its Ferrari Classiche Red Book, a window sticker, owner’s manual, Ferrari iPod Touch and dealer presentation folios, service records, a car cover, air compressor, battery tender, a clean Carfax report, and a Washington title in the owner’s name. The 16M is fitted with lighter bumper covers compared with the standard F430 Spider as well as a carbon-fiber front fin, headlight housings, mirror housings, rear grille surround, and rear diffuser. This example is finished in Rosso Corsa with a Tricolore racing stripe running down the center of the hood and over the engine lid. Additional features include xenon headlights, heated mirrors, 16M Scuderia badging, and dual exhaust finishers that exit through the rear valance. Skid plates have been added below the front bumper cover. Carbon-fiber fender shields have been added, and the removed Scuderia Ferrari fender shields are included in the sale. Photos showing paint-meter readings are included in the gallery. The 19″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires. The 16M features a stiffened chassis and a retuned suspension with ZF dampers and titanium springs. Braking is handled by Brembo carbon-ceramic rotors. The brake calipers were refinished in silver in November 2015 by Ferrari of Seattle. The brake fluid was flushed in April 2024, at which time the brake fluid reservoir cap was replaced under warranty due to manufacturer recall. The cockpit features carbon-fiber-framed seats upholstered in Nero Alcantara with patterned center inserts, red stitching, and embroidered headrests. Carbon fiber trims the console, door panels, and dashboard. Equipment includes exposed diamond-plate aluminum flooring, a stereo with iPod connectivity, automatic climate control, drilled aluminum pedals, and power windows and locks. A mirror defrost switch was replaced and sticky surfaces were refinished in February 2025. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel features an integrated LED shift light, an engine-start button, carbon-fiber shift paddles, and a manettino dial for control of dynamic settings. Instrumentation includes a central tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as a 220-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 2,800 miles, approximately 1k of which were added during current ownership. The higher-compression version of the 4.3-liter F136 V8 employed for the 16M features a revised intake manifold and exhaust as well as carbon-fiber airboxes, and it resides in an engine bay with carbon-fiber bulkheads. Factory-rated output was 503 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque when new. An exhaust valve controller switch was installed in November 2015. The battery was replaced in March 2025. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed F1 automated transaxle and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential.
