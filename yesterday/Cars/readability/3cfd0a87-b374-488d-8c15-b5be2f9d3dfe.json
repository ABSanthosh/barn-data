Canadian owners, on the other hand, will have to wait until Q2 of this year.The German automaker also stated that its adapter is the only one that has been “tested and certified” with all Mercedes EVs and PHEVs and will work on “any NACS DC fast charging port.”MBUSA x Tesla Supercharger NetworkMercedes-BenzOwners get access to plug-and-charge functionality via Mercedes MeThe integration of the Tesla Supercharger network into the Mercedes fold means that owners will also see the expansion of their plug-and-charge functionality, another critical aspect in making charging more streamlined and user-friendly.Buyers can save their payment information into their Mercedes Me app, and after charging is complete, their account will be automatically billed. It’s also worth pointing out that this functionality is slowly expanding to the other charging networks to which Mercedes-Benz vehicles have access.MBUSA x Tesla Supercharger NetworkMercedes-Benz\"By opening access to Tesla Superchargers in North America to our customers, we underline our commitment to providing our customers with as many charging options as possible. The fast-growing network of charging points available in Mercedes Me Charge will now expand to over 110,000 public charging points across the United States and Canada,\" said Franz Reiner, Chairman of the Board of Management at Mercedes-Benz Mobility AG.Final thoughtsMercedes is certainly not the only automaker to transition to NACS ports and adapters for their vehicles. While the initial naming of the North American Charging Standard (NACS) port seemed a little ambitious, that name is rapidly becoming more true every day.Automakers like Ford, Rivian, the BMW Group (BMW, Mini, Rolls-Royce), the Volkswagen Group, and more have all switched to NACS over the last several years. It’s about time for some standardization, as owners consistently cite confusing and difficult public charging as a reason they’d rather not commit to a fully electric vehicle.MBUSA x Tesla Supercharger NetworkMercedes-BenzA standardized charging system will pave the way for more convenient EV ownership in the US and, ideally, further standardization across the board. In a perfect world, owners should be able to roll up, plug in, pay, and charge without having to learn how to use another new app or user interface for payment inside or outside their vehicles.Having the same charging port is the bare minimum. There are a litany of charging providers that all use different methods for delivering juice to a battery, and the experience can be stressful and confusing as buyers try to navigate the new-to-them world of charging, owning, and driving an electric car.",
