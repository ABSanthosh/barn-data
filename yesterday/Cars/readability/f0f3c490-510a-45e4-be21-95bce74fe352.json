  "description": "Tata Motors will introduce its Harrier EV on June 3. The Indian car brand has confirmed the launch date four months after showcasing the production-spec Harrier EV at the 2025 Auto Expo in January, and has since been regularly dropping teasers. New terrain modes and V2L charging to be on offer Battery capacity and e-motors' output not known yet Harrier EV price likely to range between Rs 25 lakh and Rs 30 lakh (ex-showroom) Tata Harrier EV exterior design highlights Similar overall design The Tata EV looks largely the same as the diesel Harrier facelift. Vertically stacked LED headlights remain positioned below the blade-like DRLs, which are connected by a full-width light bar. In profile, swollen wheel arches are also familiar, as well as the rising window line merging with the thick and blacked-out D pillar for a floating roof effect. The same is the case with the upcoming electric vehicle's rear section, which houses a connected light bar, and bumper-mounted vertical fog lamp housings.  EV bits A sealed-off upper grille stands out, and the front bumper has a Curvv EV-like chrome-trimmed air dam (which neatly houses the radar sensor). Tata has not specified the size range for the aero-efficient \"serrated turbine blade wheels\", however, 17-19 inch options are expected. The ‘.EV’ badge on the front doors and ‘HARRIER.EV’ lettering on the tailgate further distinguish the model, while the body cladding is finished in silver for added contrast.  Tata Harrier EV interior details Carried-over features from the Harrier facelift In March, Tata dropped a teaser video of the Harrier EV’s interior, which, unsurprisingly, had a lot in common with the standard Harrier currently on sale. For instance, a two-tone dashboard and touch-based HVAC controls have been carried over. The teaser also showed the Tata EV featuring Harrier-like floating touchscreen, digital instrument cluster and four-spoke steering wheel. The same is true of the rotary dial for terrain modes, which remains in the centre console, and the electronic parking brake activator and panoramic sunroof. The Harrier EV will also offer new terrain modes, connected car features and over-the-air updates. Tata Harrier EV platform, battery and performance Acti.ev base The soon-to-launch Harrier is not a ground-up new EV because it's built on the same Omega base as the Harrier ICE. However, this platform has been heavily modified for electrification. With chassis tweaks, a redone floor to house the battery and an electrical and electronics (E\u0026E) framework, Tata calls it Acti.ev (Gen 2) architecture. For reference, Tata follows a similar approach with the Punch ICE, whose Alfa platform has been comprehensively re-engineered for the EV version. Dual-motor arrangement; 500km range Equipping the front-wheel drive Harrier diesel with an all-wheel drive system would have meant major re-engineering and high cost, mainly to add a rear drive shaft. In the all-electric Harrier SUV, however, AWD is easier to achieve by adding an electric motor at the rear. \"Harrier EV gets a more powerful rear axle-mounted motor...With electric motors, you can do a lot more, especially for performance,\" Vivek Srivatsa, chief commercial officer of Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, had earlier told Autocar India. The all-electric Harrier will boast a peak torque of 500Nm. Tata has not yet officially disclosed the Harrier EV's battery specs, but it will likely be bigger than the Curvv EV’s 55kWh unit. Srivatsa also confirmed an over 500km of real-world range under Tata's C75 range test cycle.
