  "text": "1967 Volkswagen Type 2 is a single-cab pickup that was acquired by the seller on BaT in April 2021 and is powered by a replacement 1.6L air-cooled flat-four paired with a four-speed manual transaxle. It is finished in green and white over gray upholstery and features a fold-down tailgate and bedsides in addition to Safari-style windshields, a roof rack, and a canvas bed canopy. Additional details include 15″ five-spoke wheels, drum brakes, electronic ignition, a Brosol/Solex H30/31 carburetor, a Dual CD stereo, an S-bend shifter extension, and an overhead ventilation system. This Type 2 single cab is now offered with service records, spare parts, manufacturer’s literature, a workshop manual, and Alberta registration. The single-cab body was refinished in green and white approximately 15 years ago and features an under-bed storage compartment, which is accessible from both sides of the truck. Additional exterior details include a canvas bed canopy and hoops, a roof rack, safari-style windshields, mesh headlight grilles, and a fold-down tailgate and bedsides. Exterior blemishes include rust, mismatched and bubbling paint, and body filler. Polished 15″ wide-five five-spoke wheels are mounted with 195/50 Hankook Ventus V2 Concept 2 tires. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel drum brakes. The cab features a split bench seat trimmed in patterned gray upholstery joined by color-coordinated door panels. A Dual CD stereo is mounted below the parcel shelf, and additional interior elements include an S-bend shifter extension, sliding side windows, and an overhead ventilation system. There is no driver’s seat belt or sunvisor installed. The two-spoke steering wheel fronts an 80-mph speedometer and an inoperative fuel level gauge. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 19k miles, approximately 1k of which have been added under current ownership. The seller states the odometer is not accurate, and true mileage is unknown. The horn works intermittently. The replacement 1.6L air-cooled flat-four was installed in 2020 and is equipped with single-port cylinder heads, electronic ignition, a degree pulley, and a Brosol/Solex H30/31 carburetor. The fuel tank was reconditioned under current ownership and an oil change was performed in July 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle equipped with gear reduction boxes. The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its Alberta registration, which serves as the ownership document in Alberta, Canada. Filed under: vw You are not connected to real-time updates.
