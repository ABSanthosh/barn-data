It has been refinished in red with white stripes over a reupholstered black vinyl interior and is powered by a Shelby-modified 289ci HiPo V8 paired with a replacement four-speed manual transmission. Additional equipment includes front disc brakes, optional 10-spoke alloy wheels, a Holley four-barrel carburetor, a cast aluminum high-rise intake manifold, a steel-reinforced fiberglass hood, a wood-rim F.I.V. Secura steering wheel, a Sport Deck rear seat, and a dual exhaust system with an H-pipe and Flowmaster mufflers. This GT350 was acquired by the seller in 2005 and is now offered with the removed transmission, copies of Shelby American documents, a Shelby American Automobile Club serial number verification letter, a 1967 service record, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The car left the factory finished in white with optional stripes and was repainted in red with white Le Mans stripes and GT350 side stripes during the 1990s. Exterior details include a steel-reinforced fiberglass hood with a center scoop as well as a driver-side mirror, functional brake-cooling side scoops, fixed plexiglass rear quarter windows, and chrome bumpers with rear bumperettes. Optional 10-spoke alloy wheels are finished in silver and mounted with newer 225/60-14″ BFGoodrich Radial T/A  tires, and a matching spare wrapped in a Goodyear Blue Streak tire is stowed in the trunk. GT350s were factory-equipped with Kelsey-Hayes front disc brakes as well as larger rear drums than standard Mustangs. In 2022, the front bucket and optional Sport Deck rear seats were reupholstered in black vinyl with weave-textured inserts, and the black carpet and headliner were also replaced. Interior details include front latch-and-link lap belts, rear lap belts, a heater/defroster, a locking glovebox, and a Kenwood cassette receiver. A wood-rim F.I.V Secura steering wheel with a GT350 center cap fronts a 140-mph speedometer flanked by fuel-level, oil-pressure, charging, and coolant-temperature gauges. A Cobra-branded 9k-rpm tachometer with an adjustable redline is center-mounted atop the dash, and Ford Motorsport oil-pressure and coolant-temperature gauges are set below the ventilation controls on the bottom edge of the dash. The five-digit odometer shows 9k miles, approximately 4,500 of which were driven by the seller. True mileage is unknown. The underside of the trunk lid bears a Carroll Shelby autograph dated April 6, 1991. The Shelby-modified 289ci HiPo V8 is equipped with a cast aluminum high-rise intake manifold topped by a Holley four-barrel carburetor and a chrome open-element air cleaner as well as a baffled aluminum oil pan and ribbed aluminum valve covers. Long-tube headers flow into a dual exhaust system equipped with an H-pipe and Magnaflow mufflers. Advertised output was 306 horsepower and 329 lb-ft of torque. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a 9″ rear axle. A copy of the Shelby American invoice to the Downey Auto Center, in Downey, California, is dated October 19, 1966, and lists the paint color along with optional alloy wheels, Rallye stripes, and rear seat at an additional cost of $304 for a total price of $3,902.75. The car is accompanied by the removed Borg-Warner T-10 four-speed manual transmission as well as copies of Shelby American documents, a Shelby American Automobile Club serial number verification letter, a 1967 service record.
