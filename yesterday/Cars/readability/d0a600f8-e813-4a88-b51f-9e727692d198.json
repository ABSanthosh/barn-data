  "description": "Aston Martin has finally released the entire spec sheet of its plug-in hybrid supercar. As compared to the model revealed in 2021, the Valhalla features updates to the exterior and interior, and it now generates even more power. In fact, the Valhalla’s torque figure surpasses that of the recently unveiled Vanquish V12 and is higher than any Aston Martin model to date. Valhalla is the first mid-engine series production Aston Martin It is more powerful than the Temerario, Artura and 296 GTB Over 600kg of downforce produced at speeds of 240-350kph Aston Martin Valhalla engine details Powering the Valhalla is a twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre flat-plane-crank V8 paired with three electric motors – two on the front axle and a starter-generator in the bespoke 8-speed dual-clutch auto gearbox. The total combined power output is 1,079hp and a whopping 1,110Nm. The Mercedes-sourced V8 makes 828hp (76.7 percent of the total) by itself, while the three electric motors make 251hp (23.3 percent). For context, the Valhalla’s outputs are higher than other plug-in hybrid supercars like the Lamborghini Temerario (920hp and 800Nm), Ferrari 296 GTB (830hp and 740Nm) and McLaren Artura (680hp and 720Nm). In order to save as much weight as possible, the dual-clutch gearbox does not have a reverse gear, and this function is completely electrically run. The claimed 0-100kph figure is 2.5 seconds, while the top speed of the PHEV is an electronically limited 350kph. An electronic limited-slip differential has also been added to the gearbox to let the ICE and EV motors operate seamlessly. In EV mode, it relies solely on the front electric motors, offering an all-electric range of 14km and a top speed of 140kph. During regular driving, the electric power is distributed across both axles to support the V8 mill’s performance. Aston Martin Valhalla exterior The supercar is built predominantly from carbon fibre, and the Gaydon-based manufacturer says it has put great focus on lightweight construction and advanced aerodynamics. In addition to LED matrix headlights with adaptive functionality and high beam assist, the Valhalla features dihedral doors integrated with a signature aerodynamic vane, channelling airflow to reduce engine and transmission temperatures by up to a claimed 50 percent. Taking some inspiration from the brand’s F1 race car, the Valhalla features a roof snorkel for air intake, behind which sits a pair of exhaust pipes. Rolling on 20-inch wheels at the front and 21-inch at the rear (with a new six-spoke design) and wearing Michelin Pilot Sport Cup tyres, the PHEV supercar boasts an aerodynamic rake, with the rear sitting higher than the front for optimised airflow. The adaptable rear wing and a carbon-fibre diffuser with integrated ducts help the Valhalla produce over 600kg of downforce when travelling at speeds of 240-350kph. Aston Martin Valhalla interior Inside, the Valhalla continues to take cues from the F1 car, boasting a low-slung seating position with carbon fibre seats crafted as a single piece. The two-seater’s cockpit, which is bigger than the Valkyrie’s, provides an ‘Amphitheatre’ effect and is said to create a driver-focused environment. As part of its Human Machine Interface (HMI) bundle, a centrally mounted touchscreen allows EV-specific and ADAS controls. It is also compatible with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Other features include a full-digital driver information cluster, dual-zone AC and a rear-view camera.
