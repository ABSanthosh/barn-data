  "text": "Appearances can be deceiving, though, as the full extent of the damage is seen once a crane pulls the car up and onto its tires October 26, 2024 at 21:01 by Stephen Rivers A Lamborghini Aventador SV crashed at Big Tujunga and ended up on its roof. Video captured the moments when workers flipped the car back onto its tires. Most of it came away unscathed but one corner of the supercar is badly damaged. Crashes happen all of the time but it’s not often that they include a rare supercar like this Lamborghini Aventador SV Roadster. Even rarer are cases where the car in question ends up on its roof. Sadly for the owner of this example, that’s exactly what happened near Big Tujunga Canyon. It’s unclear at this stage how exactly the crash itself happened but the aftermath is telling. The Aventador SV is, like most supercars, heavily engineered to keep its tires in contact with the road at almost all costs. The driver of this car somehow managed to overcome that engineering, although the circumstances under which the accident happened are, as mentioned, unknown. Read: Semi Pits Tesla, Drives Away Like Nothing Happened The video of the crash scene picks up as workers use a piece of wood to keep the passenger-side door off the tarmac. Then, a crane pulls the driver’s side of the car up, off of the ground, and then over onto its tires. That side of the car actually looks great considering what it’s just been through. Despite the initial appearances though, the truth is that this bull might have run its last time. The front passenger side of the car is completely destroyed. The bumper, front lip, fender, and hood all have significant damage. The front passenger side headlight is just gone entirely. This video is a nice reminder of innovative safety features rarely seen like the roof-mounted rollover safety system. In the case of a rollover like this, it literally springs into life and shoots what, in this case, looks like bull horns up above the canopy. Below is an example of how a similar setup works on a BMW. Pieces like the rollover protection system are reasons why this car might just end up getting parted out. Replacing these can cost several thousand dollars on their own. Tack on the cost of the bodywork, new headlight, and whatever other hidden damage there might be, and salvaging this car could easily become futile. Image Credit: The Touge Police",
