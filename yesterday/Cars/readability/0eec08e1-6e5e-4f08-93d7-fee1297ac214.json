Finished in Rosso Targa over two-tone red and burgundy leather upholstery, the car is powered by a 5.7-liter V12 paired with a five-speed manual transmission. Modifications performed under previous ownership included removing the rear bumper and installing coilover suspension, a backup camera, an aftermarket exhaust system, and 19″ and 20″ multi-piece wheels. It features front and rear limited-slip differentials, Viscous Traction all-wheel drive, a removable hardtop, a rear spoiler, retractable headlights, scissor doors, air conditioning, a Pioneer head unit, a gated shifter, and fixed-back bucket seats. This Diablo VT Roadster shows 65k Kilometers (~40k miles) and is offered in California with a clean Carfax report, a Car VX report, and a clean Arizona title in the name of the seller’s LLC. The Marcello Gandini-designed Diablo debuted in January 1990 and featured composite and aluminum bodywork. This example is finished in Rosso Targa and features retractable headlights and scissor doors. Styling cues differentiating the roadster from the contemporary VT coupe include redesigned fog and marker lights, Lamborghini shields on the side pillars, and a body-color roof panel that secures to the engine cover when not in use. The rear bumper has been removed, and additional features include a vented engine cover, a rear spoiler, and quad exhaust outlets. The black 19″ front and 20″ rear aftermarket multi-piece wheels are mounted with Nitto NT555 tires. Aftermarket coilover suspension has been added, and stopping power is provided by ventilated disc brakes at each corner with pink-finished calipers. The two-tone red and burgundy leather interior features fixed-back bucket seats, Newing seatbelts, a gated shifter, power windows, a dashboard-mounted rearview camera display, and a Pioneer Carrozzeria head unit linked to a trunk-mounted Alpine amplifier. Auxillary switches are housed in the center console, and a rearview camera display is mounted to the dashboard. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 340-km/h speedometer and a tachometer with a 7,500-rpm redline as well as auxiliary gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 65k kilometers (~40k miles), approximately 700 of which were added under current ownership. The 5.7-liter V12 features dual overhead camshafts, four valves per cylinder, and electronic multi-point fuel injection. Output was rated at 492 horsepower and 428 lb-ft of torque when new. An aftermarket exhaust system has been added, and the car has not passed a California emissions test.  Power is routed to all four wheels through a five-speed manual transmission, front and rear limited-slip differentials, and Viscous Traction all-wheel drive. Underside auxiliary lights are fitted. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage from its first entry in July 2024. A CarVX report is provided in the gallery below.
