Edition-specific equipment includes redesigned bodywork, a revised sports rear differential, three-way adjustable coilover suspension, and an Arkona White-finished body that features a racing livery that commemorates the 1989 IMSA GTO Audi 90 Quattro. Powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0L mild-hybrid V8 linked with an eight-speed automatic transaxle and Quattro all-wheel drive, the car was further specified with black Valcona leather upholstery, LED Matrix-Design Laser headlights, a sunroof, parking sensors, ceramic-composite brakes, Ibis White-finished 22″ six-spoke Avus wheels, heated and ventilated power-adjustable RS sport front seats, a Bang \u0026 Olufsen 3D sound system, and Audi MMI Touch infotainment with Navigation. Purchased new by the owner, this RS6 GT has 30 miles and is now offered in Indiana on dealer consignment with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report and a Montana title. All GT models are finished in Arkona White with a red, black, and gray livery that pays homage to the 1989 IMSA GTO Audi 90 Quattro. Edition-specific features include a redesigned front fascia, front splitter, side sills, and rear diffuser in addition to a carbon-fiber hood and vented front fenders. Additional details include Matrix-Design LED headlights with Audi laser light as well as a rear spoiler, RS badging, carbon-fiber mirror caps and side sill extensions, a sunroof, LED taillights, and a power-operated liftgate. Ibis White-finished 22″ six-spoke Avus wheels are mounted with Continental tires. The car is equipped with a three-way adjustable coilover suspension, and braking is handled by red-finished calipers mounted over cross-drilled and ventilated ceramic-composite rotors that measure 16.5″ up front and 14.6″ out back. The heated and ventilated power-adjustable RS sport front seats are upholstered in black Valcona leather with “RS6 GT” script on the backrests, Crimson Red seatbelts, and contrasting Copper and red stitching. Carbon Twill Structure trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include Audi Advanced Key keyless entry, a Bang \u0026 Olufsen 3D sound system, cruise control, four-zone automatic climate control, Lane Departure Warning, parking sensors, a surround-view camera system, and Audi MMI Touch infotainment with Navigation Plus. A badge on the center console denotes the car as #344 of 660 units produced. The microsuede-wrapped flat-bottom steering wheel is equipped with shift paddles, and it frames an Audi Virtual Cockpit Plus 12.3″ digital instrument cluster with a digital speedometer, a tachometer, and supplementary gauges. Additional display views show information such as tire pressure, torque, boost pressure, lap times, and G-force. The odometer indicates 30 miles. The twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 was factory rated at 621 horsepower and 627 lb-ft of torque. Power is routed to all four wheels through an eight-speed Tiptronic automatic transaxle and a Quattro all-wheel-drive system. A revised sport rear differential was equipped in GT trim. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Audi Dallas in Texas, along with factory equipment, colors, options, and a total manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $201,750. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. The seller tells us that a Montana title has been issued and is in transit. You are not connected to real-time updates.
