  "description": "This Superformance GT40 is a left-hand-drive Mk I example that was ordered approximately two years before arriving in the US as a rolling chassis in January 2024. The car was purchased by the owner in March 2024 and was subsequently completed by Jo’s Garage in Pompano Beach, Florida, with the installation of a 7.3-liter Godzilla V8 that features dry-sump lubrication, eight-stack fuel injection, and a Callies camshaft. Finished in a Gulf livery, the car is equipped with a Quaife five-speed manual transaxle, Wilwood slotted and ventilated disc brakes, Bilstein adjustable coilover shock absorbers, variable power steering, a front-end lift system, staggered-width 15” Halibrand-style wheels with orange-painted spokes, a “bundle of snakes” exhaust system, black seat upholstery with ventilation grommets, air conditioning, Willans harnesses, and Gulf-livery-themed gauges. After its completion in October 2024, the car was showcased at the 2024 SEMA and PRI shows. This Superformance Mk I is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a clean Florida title in the owner’s name, listing it as a 1969 Ford.",

Finished in a Gulf livery, the car is equipped with a Quaife five-speed manual transaxle, Wilwood slotted and ventilated disc brakes, Bilstein adjustable coilover shock absorbers, variable power steering, a front-end lift system, staggered-width 15” Halibrand-style wheels with orange-painted spokes, a “bundle of snakes” exhaust system, black seat upholstery with ventilation grommets, air conditioning, Willans harnesses, and Gulf-livery-themed gauges. After its completion in October 2024, the car was showcased at the 2024 SEMA and PRI shows. This Superformance Mk I is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a clean Florida title in the owner’s name, listing it as a 1969 Ford. Wrapped over an electro-galvanized steel monocoque-style frame with a pressed-steel roof structure, the fiberglass bodywork is finished in a pale blue and orange Gulf livery in the style of the 1968 and 1969 Le Mans-winning Ford GT40 Mk I. Features include a single-vent hood panel flanked by NACA ducts, faired-in headlights and fog lamps, quick-jack bumperettes, a driver-side Gurney bubble, plexiglass side windows with pop-out vents, a Kamm tail, and inverted side air scoops. According to the seller the car has been ceramic coated. Halibrand-style 15″ wheels with orange-painted spokes are secured by three-eared knock-offs and are wrapped in Avon tires measuring 215/60 up front and 295/50 at the rear. Stopping is handled by disc brakes with Wilwood calipers, slotted and ventilated rotors, and dual master cylinders. The car is equipped with variable power steering and a hydraulic nose-lift system. The left-hand-drive cockpit is trimmed in black microsuede with ventilation grommets on the seating surfaces. Additional equipment includes Willans four-point harnesses, black carpeting, a central shifter, and air conditioning. The Moto-Lita steering wheel sits on a quick-release hub ahead of instrumentation including an 8k-rpm tachometer and a 200-mph speedometer with Gulf-livery style dial faces bearing “GT40 7.3” script. The digital odometer indicates 125 miles. Ancillary gauges with pale-blue dial faces monitor oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, fuel level, and voltage. The 7.3-liter Godzilla V8 and its dry-sump lubrication system were supplied by Indy Power Products and installed by Jo’s Garage in Florida. Features include an Innov8 eight-stack fuel-injection system and intake manifold, OBR engine management with a stand-alone ECU and drive-by-wire controls, a Callies camshaft, an Auto Verdi three-stage oil pump, a billet front engine cover, billet aluminum valves covers, and a billet oil pan. The sequentially paired “bundle of snakes” exhaust system incorporates stainless-steel stepped header tubes, crossover collectors, and 3.5” resonators. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Quaife five-speed manual transaxle. Suspension incorporates Bilstein coilover shock absorbers with H\u0026R springs and anti-roll bars at front and rear. According to the seller, scrapes visible on the underside of the nose were repaired by Superformance in April 2025 after the gallery photos were taken. You are not connected to real-time updates.
