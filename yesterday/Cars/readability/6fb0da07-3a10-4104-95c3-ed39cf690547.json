  "description": "2025 will see a lot of manufacturers update their bikes because of the looming Euro 5+ emissions standards and BMW has now hopped onto that bandwagon. The Bavarian company has updated the S 1000 R, M 1000 R, S 1000 RR and M 1000 RR models in one fell swoop, with the naked R models now getting new styling, while the fully-faired RRs get redesigned aero.  M 1000 RR now gets 218hp, up by 6hp S 1000 R, M 1000 R get new twin-pod LED headlight S 1000 R's engine now makes 170hp; 5hp more BMW S 1000 R, M 1000 R: what’s new for 2025? The most distinctive change for 2025 on the sporty BMW nakeds is the new face. Both the S 1000 R and M 1000 R now use a twin-pod LED headlight, which gives the BMW supernakeds a very mean front-end look. The changes under the skin are relatively small for the bikes, with the S 1000 R now benefiting from 5 additional horsepower, raising its peak output to 170hp. In a bid to spice up its acceleration, BMW has given the S 1000 R a quick throttle and shorter final gearing. Additionally, the bike also gets Engine Drag Torque Control, which helps minimise rear wheel lock-ups under hard downshifts, along with a USB-C charger under the seat. The updated M 1000 R remains mechanically identical to the older bike, but gets the same quick throttle as the S, and its winglets are now painted black.  Also see: BMW S 1000 XR launched at Rs 22.50 lakh BMW S 1000 RR, M 1000 RR: what’s new for 2025? BMW has been able to squeeze out 6 additional horsepower from the M 1000 RR’s motor, taking the peak output to a staggering 218hp. The bike’s electronic aids are also more lenient now with a dedicated ABS mode for slick tyres. The M 1000 RR’s winglets grow even bigger for 2025 and the fairing has seen slight tweaks. In a similar vein, the S 1000 RR sportbike also gets the redesigned fairing and winglets but remains mechanically unchaged. The other visual difference is the addition of wheel covers to the front wheel of the S, which incorporate cooling ducts that direct cool air to the brake calipers.  Also see: EXCLUSIVE! We rode the official MotoGP Safety bike at the Bharat GP We expect all four models to be brought to India next year with a slight hike over their existing prices. For reference, the BMW S 1000 R costs between Rs 19 lakh-23.30 lakh, while the M 1000 R price ranges between Rs 33 lakh-38 lakh. Meanwhile, the BMW S 1000 RR is priced between Rs 20.75 lakh-25.25 lakh, while the range-topping M 1000 RR costs between Rs 49 lakh-55 lakh.  All prices, ex-showroom, India Also see: 2023 BMW S 1000 RR review: Gives you wings!",
