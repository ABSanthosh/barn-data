Previously offered on BaT in January 2025, this DB7 is now offered again at no reserve by the selling dealer with service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title. The car is finished in Rannoch Red and features projector-style headlights, fog lights, fender vents, a power antenna, and integrated dual exhaust outlets. Silver-finished 19″ nine-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Yokohama tires. Stopping power is provided by ventilated discs at each corner. The seating surfaces are covered in Saddle Tan and red leather, which extends to the dashboard, center console, and door panels. Wood veneer accents the cabin, and additional interior features include heated power-adjustable front seats, push-button start, a CD stereo, and air conditioning. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 320-km/h speedometer, a tachometer, and gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, voltage, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 6k kilometers (~3k miles). The 5.9-liter V12 was factory rated at 420 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Tremec six-speed manual transmission. An oil change was performed, and the transmission fluid and battery were replaced in December 2024.
