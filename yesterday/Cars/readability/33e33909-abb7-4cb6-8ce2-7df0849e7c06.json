  "description": "Mercedes-Benz is on an onslaught in India and wants to leave no segment empty. After EVs, coupe-SUVs, and even sedans, it is now the turn of a convertible. And no, unlike the previous ones (E 53 cabriolet and SL 55), this one does not carry an AMG badge. The CLE 300 is a cabriolet that is far from the usual gung-ho AMG models, and instead, is a convertible for those who want to take it easy. It’s more about style and the feeling of the wind in your hair than about lap times and cornering. Mercedes CLE: design The CLE’s calling card is its top down laid-back character.  In terms of design, there is a faint resemblance to the C-Class, but that’s all it is. Up close, the CLE is very different. The India-spec gets the AMG line treatment as standard, which adds a layer of sportiness to the design. As a result, the only chrome bits on the face are the studded grille and the strip on the front lip. The digital LED headlamps are wider and sharper, the bonnet features two muscular power lines, and the bumpers are sportier with piano black accents. Over to the side, you can tell it’s closer to a C-Class in dimension, thanks to the identical wheelbase. However, it trumps the C in terms of length and width. There is a prominent strip of chrome on the window line, the A-pillars, and the door handles. What also look the part are the sleek 19-inch wheels. A lot of the design will come down to your choice of colour combination. The soft-top can be had in a subtle black shade, but if you want a bit more pop, you can choose a shade of red as well for the roof. At the rear, the LED tail-lamps get a connecting element, and sporty bumpers incorporate the trapezoidal chrome exhaust tips that, like on all modern Mercs, aren’t actually connected to the exhaust system. With the top down, you need to get used to the attention. With the top down, it’s hard to miss the CLE. The long bonnet, raked windshield, sharp wheels and a stunning stance make it a looker. But even with the top up, it’s not like you’ll pass it over as just another Merc. The lines and form factor are properly unique and with the right colour combination, it will stand out. Mercedes CLE: interior Neck warmer acts as a scarf in chilly conditions. The interior of the CLE 300 is quite close to the C-Class when it comes to the dashboard design and layout. The AC vents, 12.3-inch instrument cluster and the 11.9-inch touchscreen are a straight lift, but on the CLE, the touchscreen gets a tilt function to reduce glare, especially when the top is down. Also, like with the soft top on the outside, you can opt for a bold upholstery choice for the interior to add a bit more drama. Wind deflector ensures your hairstyle is unfazed after a drive. There are more exclusive bits in the form of a wind deflector that pops out over the top of the windshield and ensures the airflow isn’t ruining your hairdo. There are vents in the front headrests that channel warm air onto the front passengers’ necks, acting as a virtual scarf in chilly weather. While that may be appreciated up north, the rest of the country is likely to keep it switched off. In terms of comfort, the seats are excellent with the right amount of cushioning and support – long distance drives will be effortless. They also get seat kinetics, along with heating and ventilation, which adds to the overall comfort. The CLE is a 2+2, but space in the back is best suited for children or short drives for adults under six feet. The backrest is upright, underthigh support is near absent and knee room is tight as well. Getting in and out, though, is extremely easy with the top folded away. Spare wheel eats into the already low boot space. What may also pose a challenge for long trips is the lack of boot space. With the soft top down, there isn’t much room; there’s space only for soft bags. Add a spare wheel, which in our conditions is handy, and you’re left with very little space.  Mercedes CLE: performance Relaxed is the one-word description for how the CLE drives. It is laid back, restrained, and perfect for a quiet cruise. With the top up, cabin insulation is excellent and does a great job of muting a lot of ambient chaos of the city. The soft top has multiple layers of sound deadening, which helps keep out the excessive road and wind noise. It can be opened in just 20 seconds at speeds of up to 60kph. The 258hp, 2.0-litre turbo-petrol is creamy smooth and has dollops of torque that come in gradually. The 258hp, 2.0-litre turbo-petrol is creamy smooth and has dollops of torque that come in gradually. Instead of lunging ahead each time you flex your right foot, the CLE glides and picks up pace gradually. Though it gets more eager when you change the mode from Comfort to Sport, it still remains close to its character as a Mercedes-Benz rather than an AMG. What adds some zest to the performance is a 48V mild-hybrid system, which provides a bit over 20hp under hard acceleration. Still, nothing about it makes you want to corner hard or drive enthusiastically, and it urges you to cruise and enjoy the top-down experience. At high revs, there is a faint rasp of the exhaust, but nothing more. 0-100kph takes 6.7 seconds and the 9-speed automatic works very well via the paddleshifters. Mercedes CLE: ride, handling Maneuvering the CLE is easy, and despite the heft gained in Sport mode, it remains light on its feet.  Being a long-distance cruiser, the suspension on the CLE is tuned for bad roads. It is soft and supple, and hence, despite the 19-inch wheels, ride comfort is very good. There is no adaptive suspension, so changing the modes won’t change the ride, but the stock setup works very well for our road conditions. One miss would be a nose-lift function as ground clearance is something to worry about, especially with a full load. Handling is effortless with a light steering. Maneuvering the CLE is easy, and despite the heft gained in Sport mode, it remains light on its feet. The 4MATIC all-wheel drive system offers good grip and control in bends, should you end up driving it enthusiastically.   Mercedes CLE: price, verdict At Rs 1.1 crore (ex-showroom, India), the CLE 300 is pricey. However, it has no direct rival as of now. The BMW Z4, at Rs 90.90 lakh, is cheaper and gets more power, but it’s a totally different experience thanks to its sportier character. While the Rs 1.3 crore Mercedes-AMG E 53 cabriolet is a full Rs 20 lakh more – and very good – it isn’t as relaxing as the CLE 300. The CLE 300 is comfy and luxurious enough to use as a daily driver, but can change its character quickly. What the CLE 300 offers is a car that is comfy and luxurious enough to use as a daily driver, but can change its character in 20 seconds and offer a completely different experience. It sits in a sweet spot with no direct competition, and if a smooth, relaxing convertible is what you want, this will be a nice choice.
