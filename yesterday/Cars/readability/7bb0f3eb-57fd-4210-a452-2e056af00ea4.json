The replacement 400ci V8 is equipped with a Holley carburetor and an Edelbrock intake, and power is routed through a three-speed automatic transmission. Equipment includes 18″ Colorado Custom wheels, power steering, MSD ignition, long-tube headers, a twin-scoop hood, a black boot cover, and power-assisted drum brakes. The cabin is trimmed in black vinyl and features a Hurst shifter, a center console, carbon-look dashboard trim, and a Pioneer touchscreen receiver that has digital instrumentation capability. This GTO convertible is now offered at no reserve with service records and a Michigan title in the seller’s name. Bodywork was performed and replacement components were fitted during a 2005 refurbishment, at which point the car was refinished in black. Details includes a replacement power-operated black soft top, a color-keyed Endura front bumper, a black boot cover, a twin-scoop hood, a hood-mounted tachometer, and dual exhaust outlets. The convertible top needs help when closing, the retractable headlight covers do not work, and imperfections including a windshield scratch and paint bubbles on the decklid seam are displayed in the gallery. Colorado Custom 18″ wheels are mounted with Hankook Ventus V12 tires. The car is equipped with power steering and a front sway bar. The seller notes the front suspension was overhauled in 2008 and the tires and brake booster were replaced in 2022. Braking is handled by front and rear drums. The front bucket seats and rear bench are trimmed in black vinyl, and aftermarket carbon-look trim accents the dashboard. Equipment include a Hurst T-handle shifter, a Pioneer touchscreen head unit, a trunk-mounted JBL amplifier, aftermarket speakers, and a center armrest. A crack in the dashboard and wear on the cabin materials is displayed in the gallery. The padded steering wheel frames a carbon-look gauge bezel with nonfunctional instrumentation. The nonfunctional odometer shows 67k miles, and approximately 5k miles were reportedly under current ownership. Supplementary digital instrumentation can be displayed on the Pioneer head unit. Total mileage is unknown. The replacement YS-code 400ci V8 was sourced from a 1968 model-year vehicle and was rebuilt in 2005, according to the seller. The cylinder heads were disassembled and resurfaced in 2008. It is equipped with an Edelbrock intake manifold, a Holley carburetor, a high-torque starter, and MSD ignition components. The fuel tank was replaced and the heater core was bypassed under current ownership. Photos of drivetrain stamps and casting numbers are provided in the gallery. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmission. Long-tube headers flow to a dual exhaust system with Flowmaster mufflers. A fluid drip is noted after long periods of storage, and corrosion is noted on exhaust components. Decoding the trim tag reveals the following information: 11B – Second week of November production Style: 68-24267 – 1968 GTO convertible Body: PON 451 – Pontiac, Michigan, assembly; production sequence Trim: 223 – Black vinyl Paint: R-2 – Solar Red with a black soft top Refurbishment photos are displayed in the gallery.
