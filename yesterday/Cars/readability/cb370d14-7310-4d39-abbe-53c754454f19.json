  "description": "Click here to buy the November 2024 issue of Autocar India Autocar India’s November 2024 issue is headlined by the new Skoda Kylaq, and we not only bring you its first look but also drive an early prototype to give you a feel of it. We also bring you details of Maruti’s first born-electric SUV for India (and the world), the e Vitara. There are reviews of the Nissan Magnite facelift, Tata Nexon CNG, and more in the car section and the RE Classic 650 and Bajaj Pulsar N125 in the bike section. There’s even an interesting comparison between two six-cylinder diesels built for different purposes: the Indian Army’s Airavat 6x6 and the Mercedes G-Wagon. For more action-packed stories, pick up the November issue. On stands now. Skoda Kylaq first look Skoda is pinning a lot of hopes on its first compact SUV. It’s got the looks; it’s got the firepower, and it’s got the creature comforts. But can it help fill the carmaker’s coffers? Exclusive! Lotus Emira review The word Lotus, in the car world, always conjures up an image of a low-slung, lightweight sportscar – like the Emira. With Lotus focusing on EVs, the last hurrah to its ICE models is to be savoured. Maruti Suzuki e Vitara first look Maruti’s first born-electric SUV, the e Vitara, is here. A dedicated skateboard platform, over 500km of claimed range and a design that hasn’t strayed far from the eVX concept show that Maruti isn’t holding anything back. MG Mifa 9 details revealed MG plans to cash in on the luxury van craze by launching the Mifa 9 in March 2025. At 5.2 metres, it’s longer than the Toyota Vellfire and Kia Carnival. Moreover, it has over 400km of claimed range. Mercedes-Benz E-Class vs BMW 5 Series comparison The LWB Mercedes-Benz E-Class created a new sub-segment of luxury cars. Now, with BMW launching the 5 Series LWB and the Merc getting a generational update, we check if the former can dethrone the king of the segment. Ratan Tata tribute Ratan Tata was an icon of the Indian industry and a true visionary. We talk about the legacy he leaves behind, some special moments we shared with the extraordinary man, and more. Royal Enfield Classic 650 review Ever hoped for a 650cc Classic with the same design and comfort as the 350? We did, too. Now that it’s here, we find out if it is as good to ride as it is to look at. Ross Branch interview India took centre stage in international rallying with Hero’s Ross Branch winning the 2024 FIM World Rally-Raid Championship. We interview the man who created history for himself and the team.",
