  "text": "Jun 7, 2025 12:30 PM EDTL.A. County wants to curb the chaos Street takeovers — where crowds block off intersections so drivers can pull stunts like donuts, burnouts, and drifts — have become a hallmark of Southern California’s underground car culture. But now, L.A. County is drawing a hard line. A new proposal would double the fine for participating in or even watching a takeover, raising it from $500 to $1,000, the Los Angeles Times reported. The idea isn’t just to hit drivers in the wallet; it’s also aimed at the crowd. Spectators fuel the vibe, create cover for drivers, and generate social media content that keeps the trend alive. By making it costly just to show up, officials hope to tamp down the spectacle altogether. View post: Porsche 911 TR 900 II By Manhart Has Hypercar Horsepower The scene’s not just sketchy — it’s getting deadly Takeovers might look like Fast \u0026 Furious-style fun, but they’ve turned increasingly dangerous. County officials point to a rise in fatal crashes, shootings, and torched vehicles tied to these events. In some neighborhoods, families say they hear engines bouncing off rev limiters just blocks from their front doors. Supervisor Holly Mitchell, whose district includes cities like Compton, Inglewood, and Carson, introduced the measure and stated that the issue is personal for many residents. In one recent tragedy, a woman in Pomona was killed during a suspected street-racing crash. Stories like that have become too common. The crackdown extends to your feed The proposed ordinance doesn’t stop with street-level enforcement. It also calls on social media platforms to enforce their own community standards and remove content that promotes illegal activity, specifically, takeover clips that rack up views and ad dollars. Officials want platforms to demonetize those videos and cut off the oxygen that keeps the culture going viral. A surge in takeovers, but only in some places Interestingly, while street takeover reports have dropped in most of L.A. County, Mitchell’s district saw a sharp rise — from 191 incidents between July and September to 297 from October through December. County officials credit some of the decline elsewhere to a coordinated task force that includes law enforcement, city leaders, and community groups working to intervene early and redesign problem intersections. Mitchell’s district is still playing catch-up, and that’s part of why she’s pushing hard for tougher penalties. Why car enthusiasts everywhere should care If you’re a car enthusiast, the rise in takeovers and the resulting crackdown might hit close to home, even if you’re not in Southern California. Similar events have popped up across the country, and cities are watching each other to figure out what works. San Jose, Atlanta, Chicago, and Houston are all places that have seen sideshows spark community backlash and new legislation. Final thoughts The L.A. County Board of Supervisors gave the proposed fine increase a thumbs-up this week, but it still needs one more vote to become law. If approved, the new penalties could go into effect later this year. There’s also talk of broader reforms — everything from hardened centerlines at takeover hotspots to possibly creating safe, legal alternatives for car enthusiasts. For now, though, the message is clear: if you’re planning to show up at a sideshow in L.A., even just to watch, you might want to think twice. Your next post could come with a $1,000 price tag.
