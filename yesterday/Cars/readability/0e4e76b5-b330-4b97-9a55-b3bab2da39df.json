  "text": "Another example of the facelifted 2024 Model 3 Performance with just 800 miles could go for even less, as the highest bid stands at $38,250 2 hours ago by Stephen Rivers The Tesla Model 3 Performance is a seriously fast sports sedan. Now, buyers are finding it with deep discounts on the second-hand market. One crossed the auction block at $12k under MSRP and another is up for grabs. Love them or hate them, electric vehicles can deliver mind-bending performance. We’re talking supercar levels of acceleration here, at least for 0-60 mph (96 km/h) and quarter-mile sprints. Take the Tesla Model 3 Performance, for instance. Priced from $54,990 or $47,490 if you choose the no-cost Stealth Grey option and meet the requirements for the $7,500 federal tax credit (the only color that qualifies without adding the $8,000 FSD package, which unlocks eligibility for all colors and also nets you the tax credit), it might just be the best value in the EV sports sedan segment. That is, as long as you can stomach the depreciation that comes with it, especially compared to something like a BMW M3, which holds its value far better. More: New Tesla Model 3 Long Range Gets Acceleration Boost Option In Some Markets Not only does the Model 3 Performance outrun a BMW M3, but it also costs tens of thousands less than the German contender. For context, the base rear-wheel-drive M3 starts at $76,000, offering 473hp and a 0-60 time of 4.1 seconds. Step up to the M3 Competition xDrive, with its 523hp and a quicker 3.4-second sprint to 60 mph, and you’re looking at $85,300. And that’s without touching BMW’s extensive options list. Meanwhile, the Model 3 Performance hits 60 mph in a blistering 2.8 seconds (albeit with a roll-out, so think around 3 seconds flat without) and rockets through the quarter-mile in about 11 seconds , all while offering just over 300 miles (488 km / EPA estimate) of range. Oh, and did we mention buyers are snapping up these Teslas for bargains on the second-hand market? Second-Hand Steals Photos Cars\u0026Bids For example, a Model 3 Performance in Ultra Red recently sold on Cars \u0026 Bids for just $46,250. It had only 2,200 miles on the odometer having been purchased new in June of 2024. To put that into perspective, that’s Lexus ES money for a car that delivers supercar acceleration. Apparently, 2,200 miles is all it takes for some buyers to lose interest in owning such a car. As with all Model Performance variants, the car in question featured a panoramic glass roof, a premium interior, heated and ventilated front sport seats, and 20-inch wheels. The sale also included the Tesla Mobile Connector kit, compatible with both 120V outlets and NEMA 14-50 240V outlets for Level 2 charging. The seller had the windows tinted and much of the body covered in SunTek paint protection film (PPF), which was applied to the front bumper, headlamps, hood, fenders, and mirror caps. Keep in mind that all of this came from Tesla with an MSRP of $58,380. Even at that price, it’s nothing short of a performance bargain. A Windshield Or Another Tesla? Interestingly, we’re about to see if this trend continues as another Model 3 Performance is up for sale again over on Cars \u0026 Bids. It has even fewer miles, just 800 so far, and with one day left into the auction, the highest bid stands at $38,250 at the time of writing with a day left (the auction ends on December 2). That’s for a car that, according to the listing, cost $56,380 new. But why is the seller parting ways with it after so little time? As it turns out, replacing a windshield was enough to drive them into another Tesla. After all, who needs a windshield when you can just buy an entirely new car? Now that’s forward thinking. “When I had to replace the windshield, Tesla had difficulties getting a replacement. They kept arriving damaged. Then, there was a lack of availability. It was dragging on. I was impatient. I just bought another Tesla while waiting for this one to be repaired,” the seller explained. And he’s not alone either. A little digging reveals that windshield replacement for Teslas can be a frustrating and costly ordeal. When parts do finally arrive, the cost can hit nearly $1,500. Despite these headaches, the Model 3 Performance remains a killer deal in the sports sedan market. Whether new or lightly used, it’s hard to argue with this level of speed and value.
