  "text": "Volvo recently kicked off EX30 deliveries in the U.S. after a long wait. While it’s only launching one trim to start, Volvo plans to release a beefier Cross Country version soon. We’ll learn more about the EX30 Cross Country during a livestream on February 10, from what Volvo says is its “cosy winter cabin” in Sweden. Like other Cross Country models in its stable, Volvo gave the EX30 more plastic body cladding and more ground clearance. The automaker equips 19-inch wheels as standard but noted that 18-inch wheels with custom tires would be available. We don’t have many other details, but the Cross Country is expected to share a battery and motor configuration with the standard AWD model. The EX30 Twin Motor Performance, the only model on sale now, costs a little over $46,000. Volvo is building them in China at the moment, subjecting them to tariffs on their way into the country, but will start production in Belgium later in 2025. In addition to the Cross Country, Volvo plans to release a cheaper single-motor variant for around $36,000. Volvo delayed the EX30 to this year over what many suspected were the 100-percent tariffs enacted against Chinese vehicles. It was initially facing a 25-percent tariff, which it said was accounted for in the promised $36,000 price, but there’s no telling what upcoming changes to trade rules will bring.[Images: Volvo]Become a TTAC insider.
