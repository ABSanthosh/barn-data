Powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six mated to a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle, the car is equipped with the Weissach, Light Design, and Chrono packages along with a front-axle lift system, Satin Black 20″ forged magnesium wheels, carbon-fiber floor mats, black leather and blue Race-Tex upholstery, carbon-backed bucket seats, a Bose surround-sound system, and LED headlights with PDLS. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, this 718 Cayman GT4 RS is now offered at no reserve with a window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, two keys, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Arizona title. The 718 GT4 RS features lightweight rear glass, vented front fenders, additional upper intakes, and a larger swan-neck rear wing when compared with the contemporary 718 GT4. Weissach Package-equipped cars are denoted by titanium tailpipes as well as exposed carbon-fiber weave on the hood, intakes, side mirror housings, and wing. This example is finished in Gentian Blue Metallic (M5D) and is fitted with LED headlights with Porsche Dynamic Lighting System as well as auto-dimming mirrors with an integrated rain sensor, ParkAssist rear parking sensors, and integrated dual exhaust outlets exiting through the rear diffuser. The 20″ forged magnesium wheels are finished in Satin Black and are mounted with 245/35/20 front 295/30/20 rear Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. A front-axle lift system was optioned from the factory, and stopping power is provided by four-wheel cross-drilled and ventilated discs. The carbon-fiber reinforced-plastic full bucket seats are upholstered in black leather with Deep Sea Blue Race-Tex inserts and stitching. Race-Tex upholstery and carbon-fiber trim extend to the dashboard, steering column, center console, and door panels. Additional amenities include Deep Sea Blue seat belts, Shark Blue door pull loops, “Weissach RS” headrest embroidery, illuminated carbon-fiber door sills, dual-zone automatic climate control, a Bose surround-sound system, and PCM infotainment with navigation. The optional Light Design Package added LED lighting in the overhead console, door handles, door storage compartments, footwells, and vanity mirrors. Carbon-fiber floor mats with leather edging were optioned. The Race-Tex-wrapped steering wheel fronts a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline flanked by a 200-mph speedometer and a configurable digital display. The optional Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 638 miles, approximately 25 of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 4.0L flat-six resides beneath a carbon-fiber cover in the rear cargo area and was factory rated at 493 horsepower and 331 lb-ft of torque. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle, and the car is equipped with Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV), and a mechanically locking differential. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Porsche Downtown of Los Angeles, California, as well as factory colors, options, and a total price of $197,600. Two keys, manufacturer’s literature, and a spare set of floor mats are included in the sale. The Carfax report lists two Manufacturer Voluntary Service Actions issued in 2024.
