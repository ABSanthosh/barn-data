  "description": "The Kia Carens Clavis EV will be launched on July 15, 2025. Not only will the Carens Clavis EV be Kia's first mass-market EV for India, it will also sit in a unique space as one of only two electric MPVs in the market for now. The other one is the BYD eMax 7, which happens to be the Carens Clavis EV's direct rival and is currently priced at Rs 26.90-29.90 lakh (ex-showroom). Kia Carens Clavis EV expected to come with 42kWh, 51.4kWh batteries Electric MPV will likely get new alloy wheels, redesigned bumpers, and more Carens Clavis EV interior and feature list expected to mirror ICE version Kia Carens Clavis EV battery and range 42kWh and 51.4kWh battery options. Kia Carens Clavis EV test mule The Carens Clavis EV is anticipated to offer the same powertrains as the Hyundai Creta Electric, namely 42kWh and 51.4kWh battery pack options mated to a sole electric motor mounted on the front axle. Output numbers for both powertrains may be identical to those of the Creta Electric, but given that the Carens Clavis is dimensionally larger than the Hyundai SUV, expect slightly lower claimed range and performance figures for the MPV's all-electric counterpart. Prior spy shots of the Carens Clavis EV also point to a different suspension setup than the ICE version, likely to support the added weight of the battery packs and motors. Kia Carens Clavis EV exterior design Similar styling to ICE Carens Clavis, but with smaller differentiators. Kia Carens Clavis rear end. Image used for representation only. The Carens Clavis EV will look mostly identical to the ICE Carens Clavis, sporting the LED ‘ice cube’ patterned headlights that extend into the front bumper and slimmer LED light bar at the rear. However, Kia will likely incorporate some notable EV-specific styling flourishes on the Carens Clavis EV, such as revised front and rear bumpers, aero-optimised alloy wheels, and more. Kia Carens Clavis EV interior and features Kia Carens Clavis dashboard. Image used for representation only. Much like the exterior, Kia isn't expected to change the ICE Carens Clavis' cabin layout for its EV counterpart. To that end, the Carens Clavis EV may offer a premium, neatly organised dual-tone dashboard with a dual-screen setup comprising a 12.3-inch infotainment system and a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display. Packed features list and safety suite. The overall list of creature comforts for the Carens Clavis EV will most likely mirror that of the ICE Carens Clavis, with features including ventilated front seats, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a panoramic sunroof, premium Bose sound system, 4-way electrically adjustable driver’s seat, cabin air purifier, wireless charger, and so on. As far as safety goes, the Carens Clavis EV is anticipated to offer 6 airbags, front and rear disc brakes, traction control, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, hill assist control, vehicle stability management, and more as standard. Level 2 ADAS could also be equipped in pricier trim levels. Also see: Kia Carens Clavis review: Carens goes upmarket Kia Seltos: your questions answered",
