Equipment includes a Positraction differential, Wilwood power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, power steering, 18″ Foose wheels, tubular front control arms, adjustable front coilovers, and a cowl-induction hood. The custom interior features aftermarket front bucket seats, a center console, a Sony infotainment system with a back-up camera, a Pioneer stereo receiver, Rockford Fosgate audio, push-button transmission controls, a Ravelco anti-theft device, power front windows, power locks, and air conditioning. This modified Camaro coupe is now offered with a build contract document, invoices, a car cover, Camaro literature, spare fluids, spare paint, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The body is refinished in Red Jewel Metallic with black hood stripes and bumpers. Features include a cowl-induction hood, SS badging, dual side mirrors, and a rear spoiler. Black-finished Foose 18″ wheels are mounted with 225/40 front and 255/40 rear Sumitomo tires. Suspension modifications include tubular front control arms and adjustable front coilovers. The car is equipped with power steering, and braking is handled by Wilwood power-assisted four-wheel discs. The cabin features aftermarket front bucket seats and a rear bench upholstered in black vinyl. Interior appointments include a Sony infotainment system with a back-up camera, a custom center console, a Pioneer stereo receiver, Rockford Fosgate audio, a push-button transmission, power front windows, power locks, air conditioning, and three-point front seat belts. A Ravelco anti-theft device installed to the left of the center stack on the lower dashboard is shown in the gallery below. A Momo steering wheel is mounted to a tilting column and fronts Dakota Digital instrumentation. The digital odometer indicates 927 miles, which is said to represent the distance driven since the engine and other related components were installed in 2023. The seller notes that approximately 374 miles were added during the refurbishment work, while they’ve since accrued 553 miles. Total mileage is unknown. The small-block 427ci stroker V8 was installed in 2023 and is equipped with Holley Sniper electronic fuel injection, an Edelbrock open-element air cleaner, body-color valve covers, an aluminum radiator, and exhaust headers. A 2021 build contract document from GQ Creations of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, is shown in the gallery below and outlines the proposed refurbishment work and replacement components. Power is sent to the rear wheels through an automatic transmission with overdrive and a Positraction differential. A custom dual exhaust system is fitted. Decoding the Fisher body tag reveals the following information: Build Date: 01D – Fourth week of January build date Style: 68-12437 – 1968 Camaro Sport Coupe Body: NOR 80480 – Norwood, Ohio assembly; body number Trim: 712 – Black upholstery with standard bucket seats Paint: J2 – Rallye Green, Black vinyl top You are not connected to real-time updates.
