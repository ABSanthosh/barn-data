  "description": "Citroen has silently discontinued its C5 Aircross SUV's base trim, Feel, which was priced at Rs 36.91 lakh. The premium SUV is now only available in the fully loaded Shine trim that costs Rs 39.99 lakh (ex-showroom, India). The entry price of C5 Aircross has gone up by Rs 3.08 lakh Year-end benefits of up to Rs 1.75 lakh on some of its MY2023 units The entry-level Feel trim lacked a few niceties, such as the panoramic sunroof, powered tailgate, wireless phone charger, traction control and hill-descent control. It also made do with a smaller infotainment screen and different upholstery and trim materials. The top-spec Shine trim continues with all the said features and is also available in optional dual-tone paint shades at no additional cost. Under the hood, the C5 Aircross continues to pack a 2.0-litre diesel engine that produces 177hp and 400Nm of torque. The unit comes mated to an 8-speed torque converter automatic gearbox, for which Citroen claims a fuel economy of 17.5kpl. As part of year-end offers, Citroen is providing benefits of up to Rs 1.75 lakh on the C5 Aircross. However, these apply only to limited MY2023 units and are valid until December 31. In October, Citroen globally previewed an all-new concept for the next-gen C5 Aircross, but there are no plans for its introduction in India anytime soon.
