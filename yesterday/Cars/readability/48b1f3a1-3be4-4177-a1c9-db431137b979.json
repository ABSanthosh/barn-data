A replacement 409ci V8 was mated to the four-speed manual transmission in 2015, and the Honduras Maroon exterior was repainted twelve years earlier. Additional equipment includes a black soft top and vinyl upholstery, quad headlights, chrome bumpers and trim, power steering, and painted 14″ wheels with covers as well as SS bucket seats and badging, a tachometer, an auxiliary gauge pod, a heater, and a hidden Pioneer cassette stereo and CD changer. This Impala SS is now offered on dealer consignment with a clean Florida title. The car was finished from the factory in Honduras Maroon (948) and was repainted in 2003. Styling incorporates chrome bumpers as well as bright trim and headlight surrounds, and other exterior details include a replacement black convertible soft top, quad headlights, 409 and Impala SS badging, and a recessed engine-turned taillight panel. Paint imperfections on the hood are noted by the consigning dealer. Steel 14″ wheels with simulated knockoff-hub covers are mounted with 215/75 Starfire Flite-Line IV radial thin-whitewall tires. SS examples were fitted with a heavy-duty suspension that included revised front and rear coil springs and shock absorbers, and the car is equipped with power steering. The car was specified from the factory with front bucket seats and a rear bench in black vinyl, and they were reupholstered under prior ownership. A Hurst knob and mechanism have been added to the shifter, and a glovebox-mounted Pioneer cassette stereo is connected to a CD changer secured in the trunk and speakers in the footwells. The dashboard-mounted Delco AM radio does not work. The two-spoke steering wheel frames a horizontal 120-mph speedometer, a clock, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. An 8k-rpm tachometer has been mounted to the column, and an auxiliary gauge pod has been added under the dashboard. The non-operational five-digit odometer shows 86k miles, and the seller approximates 500 miles driven under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown. The replacement V8 carries casting numbers indicating a 1962 409 block, and the engine was reportedly assembled by Lamar Walden and installed in 2015. It was restamped to match the car’s chassis number and fitted with dual Carter AFB four-barrel carburetors. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission. Decoding the body tag reveals the following information: 05D – 1st week of May assembly date 62 1867 – 1962 Impala convertible JA 7050 – Janesville, Wisconsin assembly plant, production sequence number Trim 815 – Black vinyl-upholstered bucket seats (Impala SS convertible) Paint 948 – Honduras Maroon The VIN decodes as follows: 2 – 1962 model year 18 – Impala 8-cylinder 67 – Two-door convertible J – Janesville, Wisconsin assembly plant 260486 – Production number You are not connected to real-time updates.
