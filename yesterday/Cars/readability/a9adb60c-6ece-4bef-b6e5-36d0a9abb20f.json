  "text": "The Yukon Denali's 25th Anniversary Package adds a blacked out grille and massive 24-inch wheels December 18, 2024 at 19:50 by Michael Gauthier GMC is celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Denali trim with a new package for the 2025 Yukon Denali and Denali Ultimate. It adds a blacked out exterior with a dark grille, matching badging, and 24-inch wheels. The Professional Grade brand has sold over 2 million Denali vehicles and the trim accounts for over 30% of sales. The GMC Yukon Denali was launched 25 years ago and it has become an institution. The trim is nearly synonymous with GMC and the company noted some owners simply refer to their vehicle as a Denali. It’s hard to argue with that as over 30% of GMC customers opted for the range-topping trim this year. Thanks to the strong showing, the company has sold over 2 million Denali vehicles in the United States. More: 2025 GMC Yukon Gets A Much-Needed Interior Overhaul And A Beefier Diesel Engine The two millionth vehicle was a 2024 Sierra 2500 HD, which was sold in Austin, Texas earlier this year. However, the luxurious trim isn’t limited to the Sierra and Yukon as customers can also get Denali versions of the Canyon, Terrain, and Acadia. The latter is particularly eye-catching, although not cheap as pricing begins at $53,900. To celebrate, GMC is offering a 25th anniversary package on the 2025 Yukon Denali and Denali Ultimate. Production will be limited to less than 3,000 units globally and all will have a blacked out appearance. Instead of the usual chrome, buyers will find a black mesh grille, black badging, and black mirror caps. They’re joined by an illuminated GMC logo as well as 24-inch wheels with a black finish. Interestingly, interior upgrades have been skipped entirely. While that’s a bit disappointing, the 2025 Yukon Denali received an extensive facelift and a far more luxurious cabin. It features an all-new dashboard with an 11-inch digital instrument cluster and a 16.8-inch infotainment system. They’re accompanied by perforated leather front seats with heating and ventilation. Buyers will also find a heated steering wheel, heated second-row seats, and a power-folding third-row. Other niceties include a power tilt/telescoping steering column, a power-sliding center console, a wireless smartphone charger, a tri-zone automatic climate control system, and a ten-speaker Bose audio system. The Yukon Denali Ultimate goes even further as it adds power-retractable side steps, a panoramic sunroof, and Super Cruise. Other highlights include an 8-inch touchscreen display for second-row passengers as well as a rear seat entertainment system with dual 12.6-inch displays. GMC’s Global Vice President Jaclyn McQuaid said, “GMC and Denali’s unique combination of premium design, luxurious appointments, advanced tech, and true capability continues to resonate with customers in the U.S. and around the world.” She added “no one does trucks and SUVs like GMC” and noted “Denali represents the pinnacle of GMC’s ‘Professional Grade’ ethos.”",
