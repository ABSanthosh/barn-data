  "description": "This 1934 Ford roadster is a modified Deluxe Cabriolet built between 1948 and 1953 by Robert Roeder, a metal finisher who worked for Mack Truck. It was retained by Roeder's wife until 1998, and following the selling dealer's acquisition in 2011 it was refreshed with a repaint in Ford Candy Apple Red urethane, off-white upholstery, and a top-end rebuilt of its Corvette 265ci V8. The seller tells us the car was hand-striped in front of the audience while on display at Amelia Island, and it was also featured on an episode of Chasing Classic Cars. The body is channeled, sectioned, and has custom details such as a narrowed '41 Continental bumper, a '48 Plymouth-based lift-off steel hardtop, a '37 Packard windshield, a forward-opening louvered aluminum hood, '40 Mercury front fenders, and '40 Ford rear fenders. Its Tri-power 265ci V8 was installed around 1958, and it is linked to a Ford three-speed manual and a 4.11 gearset. Inside are '40 Bantam Phaeton seats and a Studebaker cluster. This custom '34 roadster is now offered in Connecticut at no reserve with a clean New Jersey title.",

It was retained by Roeder’s wife until 1998, and following the selling dealer’s acquisition in 2011 it was refreshed with a repaint in Ford Candy Apple Red urethane, off-white upholstery, and a top-end rebuilt of its Corvette 265ci V8. The seller tells us the car was hand-striped in front of the audience while on display at Amelia Island, and it was also featured on an episode of Chasing Classic Cars. The body is channeled, sectioned, and has custom details such as a narrowed ’41 Continental bumper, a ’48 Plymouth-based lift-off steel hardtop, a ’37 Packard windshield, a forward-opening louvered aluminum hood, ’40 Mercury front fenders, and ’40 Ford rear fenders. Its Tri-power 265ci V8 was installed around 1958, and it is linked to a Ford three-speed manual and a 4.11 gearset. Inside are ‘40 Bantam Phaeton seats and a Studebaker cluster. This custom ’34 roadster is now offered in Connecticut at no reserve with a clean New Jersey title. Starting with a 1934 Deluxe Cabriolet purchased by Roeder in 1938, the build commenced in 1948 following damage sustained at an apple orchard. The body was channeled 6″ over the frame and sectioned 4″. The fabricated grille used Mack fire truck components for the surround, and the front fenders from a ’40 Mercury were integrated into the body. The windshield frame is a ’37 Packard unit that was chopped and narrowed, and the bumper is a narrowed ’41 Continental unit. The louvered hood was fabricated from aluminum and utilizes rumble seat hinges to open forwards, with catches mounted on the cowl. The Deluxe Cabriolet doors were cut down, and the glass was removed. The ’40 Ford rear fenders were shortened, and the wheel opening was modified. The rear valance was modified with dual exhaust outlets and a spare carrier integrated into the design. All parts were brazed and leaded into place before the original paintwork was applied, and following the selling dealer’s acquisition in 2011 the car was repainted Ford Candy Apple Red. The lift-off steel hardtop was custom-fabricated from the rear roof section of a 1948 Plymouth. ’40 Ford hydraulic brakes and tube shocks were used, and the car rides on pie-crust whitewall tires with full wheel covers. The bucket seats are thought to be from a 1940 Bantam Phaeton, and they were reupholstered in off-white in 2011.  The dashboard and bezel are from a Studebaker, and a ’38 Lincoln Zephyr steering wheel was utilized. The selling dealer has added ~100 of the ~42k miles indicated. The tri-power 265ci Corvette V8 was installed in 1958, and it underwent a top-end rebuild in 2011. The generator and carburetors were overhauled at the same time, and the selling dealer tells us a tune-up and fluid services were performed in preparation for the sale. The car has a three-speed manual and a 4.11 gearset. A custom-made history board and historical images are displayed in the gallery. A replacement VIN tag has been applied, and the car is titled as a 1934 Ford. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
