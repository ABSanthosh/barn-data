  "description": "We are in the last month of 2024 and select Tata dealerships still have unsold MY2023 stock of the Harrier, Safari, Nexon, Punch, Tiago, Altroz, and Tigor. Which is why there are massive benefits on offer this month on almost the entire Tata ICE line-up (barring the Curvv). In fact, the total benefits and discounts are even higher than last month’s. So, without further ado, here's how much you could save on your new Tata car or SUV this December. Pre-facelift Harrier, Safari get up to Rs 3.70 lakh off Pre-facelift Nexon gets discounts worth Rs 2.85 lakh Tata Altroz, Tiago, Tigor get over Rs 2.05 lakh off Disclaimer: Discounts vary from city to city and are subject to the availability of stock. Please check with your local dealer for exact figures. Tata Harrier, Safari discounts in December 2024 Save up to Rs 3.70 lakh Some dealers still have remaining stock of the pre-facelift Harrier and Safari, which were replaced in October last year. These models come with even higher discounts in December, and along with an exchange or scrappage bonus, benefits total Rs 3.70 lakh. Refreshed models produced in 2023 get up to Rs 2.70 lakh off, while benefits of up to Rs 45,000 are available on the MY2024 Harrier and Safari. Both of Tata’s flagship SUVs are powered by the 170hp, 2.0-litre diesel engine, mated to either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic gearbox. The 5-seater Harrier is priced between Rs 14.99 lakh and Rs 25.89 lakh, while the 3-row Safari is between Rs 15.49 lakh and Rs 26.79 lakh. Tata Nexon discounts in December 2024 Save up to Rs 2.85 lakh Like with the larger SUVs, some dealers still have the pre-facelift inventory of the Nexon, which is being offered with massive discounts of up to Rs 2.85 lakh. This includes cash discounts and an exchange or scrappage bonus. However, units of the Nexon facelift produced in 2023 get benefits up to Rs 2.10 lakh. MY2024 Nexons get discounts of up to Rs 45,000, depending on variant. There are no discounts yet on the recently launched Nexon CNG. Tata’s website lists 100 variants of the Nexon, which comes with as many as seven powertrain options (not including the all-electric version). The 120hp, 1.2-litre, turbo-petrol engine has a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, 6-speed AMT, and 7-speed dual-clutch auto gearbox options, while the 115hp, 1.5-litre diesel has 6-speed MT and AMT options. When running on CNG, the 1.2-litre mill produces 100hp, and is available only with a 6-speed manual gearbox. Prices for Tata’s answer to the Mahindra XUV 3XO and Hyundai Venue range from Rs 8.00 lakh to Rs 15.80 lakh. Tata Tiago, Tigor discounts in December 2024 Save up to Rs 2.05 lakh MY2023 versions of Tata’s smallest models, the Tiago hatchback and its compact sedan counterpart, the Tigor, get whopping discounts of up to Rs 2.05 lakh this month. 2024 models get discounts in the range of Rs 25,000 to Rs 45,000, depending on the variant. Both come with a 1.2-litre, three-cylinder engine that makes 86hp on petrol and 73.4hp on CNG. In either case, 5-speed manual and 5-speed AMT options are on offer. The Tiago currently costs between Rs 5.00 lakh and Rs 8.75 lakh, while the Tigor is priced between Rs 6.00 lakh and Rs 9.40 lakh. Tata Altroz discounts in December 2024 Save up to Rs 2.05 lakh Altroz hatchbacks produced in 2023, in petrol, diesel, and CNG forms, all come with discounts of up to Rs 2.05 lakh, which is a lakh more than last month. Meanwhile, most MY2024 models get up to Rs 60,000 off, depending on the variant. The performance-oriented Altroz Racer gets Rs 80,000 in total discounts this month. The Altroz range is priced from Rs 6.50 lakh to Rs 11.16 lakh, with Tata saying that there are a total of 46 variants on offer. It should be noted that the Altroz is the only model among its rivals (like the Hyundai i20 and Maruti Baleno) to offer a diesel engine option. Tata Punch discounts in December 2024 Save up to Rs 1.55 lakh The Punch SUV currently has discounts up to Rs 1.55 lakh on MY2023 models, up massively from just Rs 40,000 last month.  Units produced in 2024 have benefits of up to R 20,000, again, depending on the variant. However, there are no discounts on the entry-level Punch Pure variant or the recently launched Camo versions. Tata’s rival to the Hyundai Exter and Maruti Ignis comes with a 1.2-litre engine, making 88hp on petrol and 73.5hp on CNG. While select petrol variants get an AMT option, the CNG ones are manual only. The Punch’s price starts at Rs 6.13 lakh and goes up to Rs 10.15 lakh.
