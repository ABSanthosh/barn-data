  "description": "This replica of a Ford RS200 features a tubular steel chassis and fiberglass bodywork produced in the early 1990s by KaRa Sport Cars of the UK. Power comes from a mid-mounted, turbocharged Cosworth 2.0-liter inline-four driving the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle. Riding on adjustable coilovers and OZ Racing wheels, the car is equipped with Cibié driving lights and fog lights, a roof-mounted intercooler, a rear spoiler, and four-wheel disc brakes. The right-hand-drive cabin offers Recaro seats, a Phase AM/FM/CD head unit, and power windows, locks, and mirrors. This 430 was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024 and previously offered on BaT in November 2024, and is now offered again with a California title listing it as a 1970 Lotus.",

The right-hand-drive cabin offers Recaro seats, a Phase AM/FM/CD head unit, and power windows, locks, and mirrors. This 430 was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024 and previously offered on BaT in November 2024, and is now offered again with a California title listing it as a 1970 Lotus. KaRa Sports Cars was founded in 1991 by Peter Baisden and Richard Sellicks. Drawing inspiration from the Ford RS200, the KaRa 430 utilized fiberglass bodywork mounted to a jig-welded tubular steel spaceframe with an integrated roll cage and monocoque center section. Kits were available with numerous options, and chassis components were to be sourced from the Ford Sierra. This example is finished in white and features four Cibié driving lights mounted to the hood in addition to a pair of integrated fog lights. Other features include opening front and rear clamshells, a rear spoiler, and air intakes on the roof and sail panels. Paint chips and cracks are shown up close in the gallery. White OZ Racing wheels are accented with red lettering and wrapped in Bridgestone RE 71RS tires that were mounted in October 2024. The car rides on double LEDA coilovers all around, and braking is handled by ventilated four-wheel discs. The right-hand-drive cabin features Recaro bucket seats trimmed in gray cloth with a color-coordinated dashboard, door panels, and carpets. The car is equipped with a Phase PMP180U AM/FM/CD head unit as well as power windows, mirrors, and locks. The seller notes that the right-side window works intermittently. The three-spoke steering wheel frames a 170-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. Gauges for boost pressure and oil pressure are mounted in the center stack. The five-digit odometer shows 15k miles, approximately 100 of which have been added under current ownership. The front-mounted radiator is cooled by dual electric fans. The turbocharged Cosworth 2.0-liter inline-four is equipped with a roof-mounted intercooler. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle. The car is titled in California as a 1970 Lotus using the VIN 652663.
