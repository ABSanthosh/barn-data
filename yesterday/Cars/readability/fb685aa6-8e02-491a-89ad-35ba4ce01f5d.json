  "description": "This 1967 Ferrari 330 GT 2+2 is one of approximately 455 Series II examples produced and was ordered by its first owner via the Estes-Zipper Motor Company of Beverly Hills, California on June 14, 1967. Chassis 10165 stayed with its original owner until 2001, and it was purchased by the current owner in 2011. The car is finished in silver over red leather upholstery, and power comes from a 4.0-liter Colombo V12 that breathes through triple Weber carburetors and is mated to a five-speed manual transmission. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, a quad-exit exhaust, power-assisted steering and four-wheel disc brakes, 15\" Borrani wire wheels, air conditioning, power windows, and a rear window defroster. This Ferrari 330 is now offered on dealer consignment with factory literature, tools, original sales documentation,  and a clean Illinois title in the owner's name.",

Chassis 10165 stayed with its original owner until 2001, and it was purchased by the current owner in 2011. The car is finished in silver over red leather upholstery, and power comes from a 4.0-liter Colombo V12 that breathes through triple Weber carburetors and is mated to a five-speed manual transmission. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, a quad-exit exhaust, power-assisted steering and four-wheel disc brakes, 15″ Borrani wire wheels, air conditioning, power windows, and a rear window defroster. This Ferrari 330 is now offered on dealer consignment with factory literature, tools, original sales documentation,  and a clean Illinois title in the owner’s name. Designed by Tom Tjaarda at Pininfarina, the 330 GT debuted at the Brussels Motor Show in early 1964 as a replacement for the 330 America. It features a longer wheelbase and a wider grille than its predecessor. The Series II model was introduced in 1965 and featured styling updates that included single headlights, three-louver fender vents, and bumpers with rubber-lined overriders. This example is finished in Grigio Argento and features a retractable antenna, a Talbot-style driver-side mirror, front and rear quarter vent windows, Pininfarina quarter panel badges, and quad exhaust outlets. The 15″ Borrani wire wheels feature three-eared knock-off hubs, and they are mounted with 215/70 Pirelli P5 tires. The car is outfitted with power steering, and replacement front springs and Koni shocks were reportedly installed in 2022. Stopping power is provided by servo-assisted Dunlop disc brakes with a dual-circuit master cylinder. The cabin features front bucket seats that were fitted with replacement seat foam and red leather upholstery under current ownership. Matching upholstery extends to the rear bench seat and door panels, and color-matched carpets line the floors. Equipment includes power windows that were serviced under current ownership as well as air conditioning, a Pininfarina-branded ashtray, front lap belts, a wood dash panel with a locking glovebox, and a rear window defroster. The wood-rimmed steering wheel sits ahead of Veglia instrumentation including a 180-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for oil temperature and oil pressure. Additional readouts for water temperature, amperage, and fuel level are mounted in the center of the dash along with a clock. The five-digit odometer shows under 34k miles, approximately 3,100 of which were added under current ownership. The 4.0-liter Colombo Tipo 209 V12 breathes through triple Weber carburetors and was factory rated at 300 horsepower. The engine is said to have been rebuilt by Patrick Ottis of Berkeley, California, in 2004, and an oil change was performed in 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, which was standard equipment on all Series II 330 GTs. The original order sheet is presented above, and it lists standard features and options as well as a trade–in on a 1966 Volkswagen camper for a total sale price of $16,540.
