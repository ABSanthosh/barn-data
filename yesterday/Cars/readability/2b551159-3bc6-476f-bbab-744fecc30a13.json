  "text": "The upcoming crossover appears to borrow heavily from the FF91 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Faraday Future has teased the FX 6, ahead of a possible unveiling in March. The model is a sleek crossover that appears to mimic the $309,000 FF91. Pricing is slated to begin between $30,000 and $50,000, but Faraday has a spotty track record. Following the release of a low resolution teaser in January, Faraday Future has provided a better look at their upcoming FX 6. Set to be offered by their new Faraday X brand, the model follows in the footsteps of the FF91 but promises to cost a fraction of the price. The company has been tight-lipped about specifics, but the camouflaged prototypes have a rounded front fascia and a rakish windscreen that flows into a sloping roof. Designers also gave the model streamlined bodywork and an upward sweeping beltline, which results in a relatively compact greenhouse. More: Faraday Future Teases New FX 6 Crossover And Super One Minivan The rear end is heavily disguised, but the FX 6 features an angular rear window and what appears to be a roof-mounted spoiler. A mid-mounted spoiler can be seen further below and we can also make out a concave lower liftgate. While it’s hard to know what the final result will look like, it’s giving off a Kia EV6 vibe. Faraday will have more to say about the model in March, but the prototypes will “undergo further testing and validation” in the United States to ensure the FX 6 meets their “high standards for performance, technology, and user experience.” They added these tests will include a focus on autonomous driving as well as advanced driver assistance systems. The FX 6 is slated to start between $30,000 and $50,000. Little else is known about the model, but the company has implied it, as well as other FX vehicles, could offer electric and range-extended powertrains. FX production could begin later this year, but Faraday has previously said that’s “subject to securing necessary funding and agreements.”",
