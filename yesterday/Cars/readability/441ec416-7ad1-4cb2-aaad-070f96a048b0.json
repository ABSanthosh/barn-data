  "description": "Should you be worried about the battery life of an electric car? Not if you pay close attention to our guide For many car owners, the electric car represents an entirely new way of driving and brings with it many queries and worries. One of the largest concerns is how long the battery life is on an electric car. You may well have read horror stories about electric car owners facing hefty bills for replacements or contemplating cutting their losses on cars that are otherwise worthless because they literally don't work. And it’s not hard to see where these rumours and anecdotes come from, because our extensive experience of mobile phones, tablets and laptop computers has shown many that, even over a relatively short period of time, the batteries powering them can quickly lose efficiency, resulting in the need for more frequent charging. In extreme cases, the degradation is so severe that the device won’t even fire up unless it’s permanently on charge, which is obviously no use for an EV. There’s also no denying that battery technology doesn’t come cheap, and should the cells ever need replacement, it’s quite likely that they will cost more to swap than the car is now worth - which is why we tend to replace mobile phones in their entirety rather than replace the battery pack.  Battery swapping stations, where depleted electric car batteries can be changed for fully charged ones in mere minutes, are beginning to crop up in Europe and may offer an answer to battery life queries. But how bad is the electric car battery problem really? The good news is that the more electric cars that are out there and the longer they are run for, the more evidence is produced to show that the power pack will often last the lifetime of the car. Better still, there are plenty of tips and strategies you can follow to make sure your car’s batteries will survive better than most. Battery life for electric cars Generally, electric car batteries last for as long as the rest of the car. But like with your phone or laptop battery, they degrade over time. Ultimately, the cells should still have at least 70% of their capacity even after 200,000 miles, which is the sort of mileage that few cars ever reach, whether they’re combustion-engined or electric.  As an example, a number of Tesla Model S taxis operating from Gatwick airport racked up more 300,000 miles each over three years and all retained at least 82% battery health. Why does an electric car battery lose charge or degrade? The truth is that batteries degrade over time and with use, meaning they become less efficient as they age and provide a shorter range. Continual advances in battery technology mean that issues surrounding degradation of performance are being reduced all the time. However, even the latest lithium ion cells aren’t completely immune to losing performance over time, with a number of factors playing a role.  Perhaps the biggest single contributor to the decline in efficiency is the cycle of use and charging. Frequent draining of the cells followed by a full charge can over time damage the battery’s ability to maintain its optimum energy storage. That's why manufacturers typically recommend charging only to 80% and never letting the range drop to zero miles. Rapid charging also plays a part, because channelling so much electrical energy and so quickly generates much higher temperatures in the battery pack.   Liquid cooling of the cells helps mitigate this, but use a rapid charger frequently and over time these extreme heat cycles will cause damage to the lithium ion packs. In a similar but less extreme way, cars that are used in hotter climates tend to suffer a subtly greater reduction in performance than those used in cooler conditions. How long do Tesla batteries last? Tesla claims its batteries last between 300,000 and 500,000 miles. For a Tesla Model 3 Long Range with a 436-mile WLTP range, that makes for between 700 and 1500 battery charge cycles. We have experience running used Teslas on our fleet, including a four-year-old used Tesla Model 3 that had covered roughly 40,000 miles. Despite this, its battery had degraded only 2%. Hundreds of other examples point to our findings too, so it's safe to say that Tesla batteries can last for a long time and hold their all important percentages.  How can I care for my electric car battery? Happily, there are ways you can help preserve the power and efficiency of your battery over time. One of the major ways of protecting the cells is by carefully managing the charging and discharging of the cells, which in an ideal world means trying to avoid the charge dropping below 20% and not adding more than 80% when charging - above the latter figure is when batteries tend to get hottest, which takes a toll on the cells’ delicate chemistry. Happily, most EVs now give you the option to programme your car’s charging schedule, allowing you to decide when the electricity flows and, crucially, letting you set a cap on exactly how much pours into the cells. By the same token, it’s best not to completely drain the battery. Most EVs will always make sure there’s a bare minimum of energy left even if it won’t allow the car to move, but storing your car for long periods and allowing electricity to leech away is to be avoided. Speaking of charging, it’s best to only use DC rapid chargers sparingly. Although fine for topping up on longer journeys or in emergencies when you need a quick burst of energy, a by-product of rapid chargers’ speed is the increased, lithium-ion-damaging temperatures in the battery as it copes with the electrical onslaught. If the car is to be used in extremes of hot or cold weather, always make sure the car is plugged in to charge (with the maximum limit set to 80%, of course) regardless of range. This trickle-charging technique allows the battery’s thermal management system to continue working and keep the cells at the optimum temperature for longevity. Finally, the way you drive your EV can affect its battery life. Much like rapid charging, quick depletion of the cells can cause damage that over time will lead to reduced efficiency and range. Ultimately, the faster you drive and the more you make use of an EV’s trademark instant torque for lightning getaways, the more you cause damaging heat build-up in the battery. So it’s best to take it steady if you want longevity. Electric car battery warranties Manufacturers are acutely aware that potential electric car buyers could be put off by the possibility of premature and expensive battery failure. The truth is that when treated correctly, most modern lithium ion batteries are likely to last the lifetime of the car. Even so, most firms cover the battery with a separate, extended warranty. Most car warranties are around three years and 60,000 miles, but this is increased for the battery element in EVs. For instance, Audi, BMW, Jaguar, Nissan and Renault cover the cells for eight years and 100,000 miles, while Hyundai ups the mileage limit to 125,000. Tesla has the same eight-year timeframe but a mileage limit of 150,000 on the Model S and Model X, 120,000 on the Model 3 Long Range and 100,000 on all other versions.  And apart from Audi and Tesla, most include a maximum allowable capacity (between 70 and 75%) for the battery, which will trigger a replacement if it dips below this figure during the warranty period.",

Having started his automotive career on, ahem, another weekly automotive magazine, he rose through the ranks and spent many years running that title’s road test desk. This was followed by a stint doing the same job for monthly title, evo, before starting a freelance career in 2019. The less said about his wilderness, post-university years selling mobile phones and insurance, the better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/block\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n  \n        \u003ch2\u003eused   cars for sale\u003c/h2\u003e\n    \n  \n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n  \n  \n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIn partnership with\n      \u003cspan\u003e\n        \u003cimg src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/themes/custom/autocar/images/autotraderlogo.png\"/\u003e\n      \u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n  \n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n  \n      \n  \n  \u003cdiv id=\"signup-replace\"\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://p.autocar.co.uk/signup\" target=\"_blank\" id=\"edit-0--2\"\u003eNewsletter\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGet all the best car news, reviews and opinions direct to your inbox three times a week.
