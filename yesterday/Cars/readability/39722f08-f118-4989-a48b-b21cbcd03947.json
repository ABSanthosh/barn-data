  "text": "This famous movie car is available for the less than a new Corvette E-Ray June 26, 2025 at 21:11 by Stephen Rivers The classic Pontiac GTO from the 2002 movie XXX is listed for $79,900. Its interior features 16 gauges, flame decals, and turbo boost props. Power comes from a 6.6-liter V8 with 335 hp, paired to an automatic. Movie cars can be incredibly valuable. In fact, they can get so famous that fans build tribute cars for decades after seeing a unique creation on screen. Those replicas can be worth big money depending on where they’re from. In this story, though, we have the genuine article, a real movie car with functioning prop technology, and it costs less than a new Corvette E-Ray. This 1967 Pontiac GTO is a special car even without its silver screen connections. It has a stunning design language, an iconic grille, and belongs to a historic, but sadly deceased, brand. Some of those aspects led filmmakers to use it as the hero car in 2002’s XXX starring Vin Diesel. This is one of the cars he piloted in the film. More: Is A Movie Car A Copyrighted Character? A Top Court Just Decided As such, it comes complete with everything you see him interact with in the movie. The cabin is absolutely wild with what appear to be at least 16 different gauges or round light pods on the dash. In a way, it’s a time capsule of early 2000s car style. One turbo boost gauge in the cockpit is even complete with flame decor on its face. In the movie, all of the stunts this car does with missiles are real, practical effects. In a video from Jay Leno’s Garage below, the previous owner highlights how everything functioned. As it sits today, some of the plumbing is different, so it’s unclear if all features are still fully operational. MotorCarClassics What’s beyond doubt is that people won’t mistake this car for any other GTO. The exterior still sports the one-off paint color created for the film, the XXX logo, and functional side pipes. Under the hood rests a 400-cubic-inch V8 that makes 335 horsepower (249 kW) and sends that power to the rear wheels via an automatic gearbox. As of this writing, the car is available for $79,900 from Motor Car Classics. That’s a lot of cash, but in the end, the buyer will end up not just with a genuine movie car but one that runs, drives, and looks great doing so. Fancy a different GTO from the franchise? You can check out this one that may pique your interest, especially if you’re a fan of a certain A-list thespian who starred in iconic films like Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds and Shaft.
