  "description": "Hyundai India has started accepting bookings for the upcoming Creta Electric with a token amount of Rs 25,000. However, registrations for the base Executive trim haven't commenced yet. This comes ahead of its launch on January 17 at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo. Long Range Creta EV promises 473km range Rivals include Tata Curvv, Maruti e Vitara, Mahindra BE 6 Hyundai Creta Electric: how's it different from regular Creta? Since the Creta EV is based on its ICE sibling, the overall compact SUV silhouette looks identical. Save for bits like a shut-off bumper grille, active air flaps and a new skid plate, not much differs. Others include an aerodynamic design for the alloy wheels and a refreshed bumper. Pixel-theme-based inserts make the e-SUV look in line with premium Hyundai EVs like the Ioniq 5. For a detailed report on the exterior differences, click here. About the interior, this new Creta borrows the steering wheel from the Kona EV (sold abroad) and the Ioniq 5’s drive mode selector (Eco, Normal and Sport). Features carried over from the Creta ICE include two 10.25-inch screens for instrumentation and infotainment, a panoramic sunroof, 360-degree camera setup and ADAS.  Hyundai will sell the EV in five variants: Executive, Smart, Smart (O), Premium and Excellence. For now, the larger battery pack can only be booked on the Smart (O) and Excellence trims. As for colours, there will be 10 shades to choose from, including dual-tone and matte options. Hyundai Creta Electric: battery packs, range Two battery packs of 51.3kWh (473km range) and 42kWh (390km range) will be offered with the Creta Electric, both ARAI mileages. The Creta Long Range (51.3kWh) charges from 10 to 80 percent in 58 minutes with a 60kW DC fast charger, while 10 to 100 percent takes 4 hours with an AC wall box unit. The EV goes from 0 to 100kph in 7.9 seconds, which is even faster than the Creta N Line DCT (8.9 seconds). Single-pedal driving will also be offered in the compact electric SUV. Rivals to include the Tata Curvv EV, MG ZS EV, Maruti e Vitara and Mahindra BE 6 (earlier BE 6e).
