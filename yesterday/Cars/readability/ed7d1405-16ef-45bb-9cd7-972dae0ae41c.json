  "description": "This 1977 Porsche 930 Turbo Carrera is a US-market coupe that was exported to Germany in 2008 and brought back to the US the following year. While the car was in Germany, the turbocharged 3.0-liter flat-six and four-speed manual transaxle were overhauled, and additional work under prior ownership involved a repaint in its factory shade of black and reupholstering the interior in black leather. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, 16\" Fuchs alloy wheels, a sunroof, a whale tail rear spoiler, sport seats, a cassette stereo, MB Quart speakers, air conditioning, and power windows. This 930 Turbo was acquired by the seller in 2023 and is now offered with a Porsche Production Specifications certificate, service records, a tool kit, and a clean Florida title in the seller’s name.",

While the car was in Germany, the turbocharged 3.0-liter flat-six and four-speed manual transaxle were overhauled, and additional work under prior ownership involved a repaint in its factory shade of black and reupholstering the interior in black leather. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels, a sunroof, a whale tail rear spoiler, sport seats, a cassette stereo, MB Quart speakers, air conditioning, and power windows. This 930 Turbo was acquired by the seller in 2023 and is now offered with a Porsche Production Specifications certificate, service records, a tool kit, and a clean Florida title in the seller’s name. The car was finished from the factory in black (A1) and was stripped to bare metal and repainted under previous ownership. Features include an optional sunroof as well as front fog lamps, headlight washers, rear fender stone guards, rear bumperettes, a front spoiler, and a “whale tail” rear spoiler. European-style H4 Hella headlight lenses have been added. Paint meter readings are visible in the gallery below. Staggered-width 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels are wrapped in Pirelli Cinturato P7 tires, and they measure 205/55 up front and 225/50 out back. The ride height has been lowered. A November 2023 service included replacing the rear sway bar bushings and drop link. Stopping power is provided by power-assisted four-wheel ventilated discs. The cabin features front sport seats and a matching dash pad that were reupholstered in black leather under previous ownership. Interior features include a Blaupunkt cassette stereo, MB Quart speakers, power windows, Coco floor mats, and air conditioning. The throttle cable and pedal bushings were replaced in December 2024. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 150-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,700-rpm redline as well as an analog clock and gauges for oil level, oil temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer was repaired in December 2024 and now shows 60k miles. Approximately 200 miles were added under current ownership. The turbocharged 3.0-liter flat-six was factory rated at 245 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque and was overhauled in 2009. The alternator pulley and belt were replaced in December 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle and an optional limited-slip differential. The transaxle was overhauled in 2009 and the flywheel was replaced at that time. The Porsche Production Specifications certificate shows the factory colors and a production completion date in February 1977. Photos taken at the time of the repaint can be seen in the gallery.
