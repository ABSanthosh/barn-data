  "text": "Comparisons to other SUVs is the theme of this round of questions about the Land Rover Defender February 22, 2025 at 19:41 by Stephen Rivers We just finished a week of on- and off-road testing the Land Rover Defender.  Before driving it we asked what you wanted to know – and here are your answers. Of all the SUVs we’ve tested in recent memory, the Land Rover Defender really stands out. Granted, it’s not the most efficient, the fastest, or even the most capable off-road. What it is though is a well-rounded luxury SUV with a “go-anywhere” attitude. Before we picked it up and took it way off-road we asked what you wanted to know about it. Today, we’re giving you the answers. As a refresher, our Defender was a 110, i.e. a four-door five-seater. It came with the P400 powertrain, which consists of an inline-six with an electric supercharger, a traditional turbocharger, and some mild hybrid components. Finished with the X-Dynamic SE trim, it has an MSRP of $81,923. With all of that out of the way, let’s get to the questions. Why Compare The Defender To The Jeep Wrangler V8? In our initial Ask Us Anything piece about the Defender, we specifically compared some of the specs of the Defender to the Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392 Final (but not really) Edition. One reader asked why we’d compare them considering that we brought out pricing and speed when Land Rover also offers a V8 that we didn’t mention and that speed isn’t the paramount concern for hardcore off-roaders. Review: 2025 Land Rover 110 Defender Is A Go-Anywhere Luxury SUV That Loves To Get Dirty Let’s detail a few things about that. Let’s say that you have around $90,000 to spend on an SUV. You also want one with true off-road capability. In that case, you’re likely to compare this Defender to the Wrangler we drove. We could’ve compared the V8 Defender to the Wrangler but hear us out. The Defender with a V8 still costs less than the Wrangler in many trims. Not only did we not have access to the V8 in person, but even with the inline-six it proved to be a better all-around SUV than the Jeep. As we brought out in the full review of the Wrangler, for those who prioritize hardcore off-roading, there are lots of ways to do that for a lot less cash. Should Jaguar Have Put This Engine Into The XE? Absolutely. The XE wasn’t a bad sedan and the engines it was offered with weren’t an issue anyway. Nevertheless, we’d love to see what a Jaguar XE might feel like with the P400 inline-six under the hood. It’s responsive, powerful, and very smooth. Who doesn’t want that kind of a power plant in a sedan? For many reasons though, this never came to pass. But who knows – maybe an owner decides at some point to do an engine swap… How Does It Compare To The Discovery? Think of the Discovery as the softer, more luxurious Defender. That’s the easiest way to describe the difference between the two very similar SUVs. The on-road driving dynamics are a touch sharper. The driving position feels more classically Land Rover and the cargo area is a touch more accessible. It’s also worth noting that the Discovery can be highly capable off-road too, so go with whichever feels more your style and don’t look back.",
