  "text": "This 1959 Cadillac Series 62 convertible is finished in white over red vinyl upholstery and powered by a 390ci V8 paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. The car features quad headlamps, dual-bullet taillights, fender skirts, and upright fins along with a power-operated black soft top. Further equipment includes power-assisted steering and drum brakes as well as power windows and a power-adjustable front bench seat. Acquired by the seller in 2019, this Series 62 convertible is now offered with a shop manual, model literature, and a clean Michigan title in the seller’s name. Cadillac offered four models for 1959, all measuring 225″ in overall length and featuring updated front and rear grilles, dual-bullet taillights, and upright fins. A total of 11,130 Series 62 convertibles were produced for the model year, and this example left the factory finished in Dover White. The car was repainted under previous ownership, while the chrome was replated in 2022. Features include a power-operated black soft top, a driver-side mirror, quad headlamps, and fender skirts. This is a relist after the vehicle was previously sold on BaT in August 2024 and the winning bidder failed to follow through with their commitment to purchase. This was not due to any fault with the vehicle. The winner’s participation on BaT has been restricted and their buyer’s fee was not refunded. Steel wheels wear chrome covers and are mounted with Goodyear whitewall tires, and a full-size spare is stowed in the carpeted trunk. The car is equipped with power steering, and braking is handled by power-assisted drums at all four corners. The brake booster, master cylinder, and front brake linings were replaced under current ownership. The cabin features a power-adjustable front bench and a rear seat that was retrimmed in red vinyl under previous ownership joined by a color-coordinated dashboard, door panels, and carpeting. Further appointments include an analog clock, power windows, and a heater and defroster. The push-button AM radio does not work. The red steering wheel wears a replacement chrome horn ring and frames a horizontal-sweep 120-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges. The instrument cluster and dashpad were refurbished in 2023, and the Autronic Eye system is not connected. The five-digit odometer shows 60k miles, approximately 2k of which have been added under current ownership. The 390ci V8 was rated at 325 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque when new. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Hydra-Matic four-speed automatic transmission. A replacement exhaust system was installed under current ownership, and the seller notes rust on various chassis components. The Fisher body tag shown above decodes as follows: Style 59–6267 – 1959 Series 62 convertible Body FW9169 – Fleetwood body number Trim 29 – Red Leeds grain leather, red carpets Paint 12 – Dover White paint Top 2 –  Black convertible top E – E-Z Eye glass H – Heater Y – Six-way power-adjustable front bench seat You are not connected to real-time updates.
