  "description": "Some images of a new camouflaged Mahindra test mule recently surfaced on the internet. Autocar India can confirm that the spotted prototype is a major facelift for the Mahindra Bolero Neo that’s scheduled for a debut on August 15. While initial spy images were quite blurred, new spy shots now give us a clearer look at some of the design details on the upcoming Bolero Neo facelift. Update for Bolero Neo to bring completely new body shell Will come fitted with six airbags as a safety update Will debut on August 15 Mahindra Bolero Neo facelift: what to expect?  Completely new body panels all around  First thing first, this is not an all-new generation, but a heavily facelifted version of the Bolero Neo. So, it will continue to be underpinned by a ladder frame chassis, but Mahindra has opted for a completely different top hat with this update. None of the body panels seem to have any resemblance with the existing Bolero Neo, and that’s not the usual approach with facelifts. At the front, the test mule can be seen with the distinctive Mahindra grille and a new logo, but the bigger highlight are the circular headlamps that seems to have come from the Thar Roxx. It also gets a more upright nose, a newer and more rugged looking bumper and new LED fog lamps, too. In profile, it continues with very short overhangs and squared-out wheel arches, but the keen eyed among you will notice a new glass house, new flush fitting door handles, more pronounced body cladding and new multi-spoke alloy wheels that look very similar to that of the XUV700’s. At the rear, it continues with a side-hinged door and a tail-gate mounted spare wheel, but the rear quarter view also reveals a more prominent shoulder line and new vertically-stacked tail lamps. In fact, the rear quarter almost has a Land Rover Defender-like profile, while the front end looks much like a Mercedes G-Wagon. Overall, it seems to have moved up in positioning, and appears a lot less utilitarian. On that matter, sources say that Mahindra will also equip the Bolero Neo facelift with six airbags, among several other changes to the interior. The interiors were not seen in these images, but it could get an all-new dashboard, a larger touchscreen and even a sunroof, among other features. Mahindra Bolero Neo facelift: powertrain options Mahindra currently offers the Bolero Neo with a 1.5-litre, three-cylinder diesel engine that produces 100hp and 260Nm of torque, and it solely comes mated to a manual gearbox. It is unclear if Mahindra will introduce any mechanical upgrades with this facelift, although an automatic gearbox can be expected to be added to the powertrain lineup.  The updated Bolero Neo is expected to debut at Mahindra’s annual Independence Day gala on August 15, perhaps in a near-production guise. The launch is expected sometime next year, as was corroborated by Mahindra at its earnings call earlier this year.
