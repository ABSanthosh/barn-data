  "description": "Shortly after teasing us with the Basalt Dark Edition, Citroen India has dropped yet another teaser confirming dark editions of the Aircross SUV and C3 hatchback. Like in the Basalt, we expect the Aircross and C3 dark editions to only get exterior and interior cosmetic updates. Aircross and C3 dark edition variants to get dark chrome accents Interior to have black upholstery with contrast stitching All cars will likely carry over the same powertrain options Citroen Aircross, C3 dark editions: what to expect? All black exterior finish  The teaser video hints at a stealthy black exterior paint shade for all three cars, along with dark chrome accents for the grille inserts, badges and alloy wheels. The standard versions of these cars have a bumper with silver accents, which could get a darkened finish on the Dark Edition. Additionally, the headlamps could get a smoked-out finish. New black leatherette finish for dashboard  Interestingly, the teaser also gives a glimpse at the interior, which gets a leatherette finish for the dashboard with contrast red stitching. All regular models of Citroen get a plastic dashboard, so this could be a notable upgrade, at least on the Basalt and Aircross. The teaser also gave us a peek at the new black leatherette upholstery with contrast stitching. However, the equipment list can be expected to remain unchanged. The Dark Edition models will likely be based on their respective car’s top-spec trim. Citroen Aircross, Basalt, C3 dark editions: powertrain options  Likely to come with a Turbo engine  The Dark Edition variants of the Aircross, Basalt and C3 are expected to remain mechanically unchanged. All three cars get either an 82hp, 1.2-litre naturally aspirated petrol or a 110hp, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol; only the latter gets an automatic gearbox option. The Dark Edition variants will likely be offered in top Turbo guise only. Growing popularity of dark edition models The list of dark edition SUVs seems to be growing constantly. Models like the Hyundai Creta, MG Astor, Honda Elevate, Tata Harrier and Safari, Jeep Compass and Mahindra Scorpio N all have Dark Edition variants, with the Mahindra XUV700 Ebony Edition being the most recent addition. And it’s not just limited to SUVs, as the Toyota Hilux and MG Comet also received dark edition variants recently. Besides these Citroen models, the Tata Curvv is also expected to get a dark edition soon.
