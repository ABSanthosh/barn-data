  "text": "This isn't the first time we've seen the new Charger spawn some impressive renderings, but is Dodge actually going to make any design changes? 2 hours ago by Brad Anderson A designer has transformed the new Charger into a widebody ICE model with SRT Hellcat looks. While an inline-six turbo is launching this summer, no plans for a Hemi V8 have been confirmed. More aggressive versions of the coupe, like a Super Stock trim, could help attract more buyers. With no V8 option (at least not yet) and the six-cylinder version still waiting in the wings, the new-age Dodge Charger hasn’t exactly set the world on fire, despite packing a powerful electric powertrain. However, these renderings show that with the right visual tweaks, it could easily be transformed into a seriously good-looking muscle car when its ICE variant comes out later this year. Since the new Charger has only been around for a few months, aftermarket support is still relatively sparse. But for any bodykit manufacturer out there searching for inspiration on how to give it that true muscle car vibe, these renderings might just be the answer. Even better, Dodge itself could take some cues from this design for a potential future Widebody version. Read: Designer Envisions 2026 Dodge Charger SRT8 With A Glorious Hemi These renderings have been brought to life by Abimelec Design and depict the new Charger in ICE guise and in particular with a Hemi V8. It retains most of the body panels of the stock model yet looks much more aggressive. The changes start up front, where there’s an extended lip spoiler and a new hood with dual snorkels, just like the ones on the discontinued Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye or the SRT Super Stock. It has then been equipped with a set of aftermarket wheels and the ride height has been significantly lowered. While driving with so little space between the wheel arches and tires would be hugely impractical, the setup certainly looks the part. Abimelec Design The talented designer has also imagined the Dodge with flared front and rear wheel arches, just like past Widebody models. While some might not be fans of the aftermarket fenders, there’s no denying that they add a bit of extra swagger to the car. Completing the modifications are a large lip spoiler on the tailgate, a distinctive rear diffuser, and quad tailpipes. And of course, the Charger sports a ‘Hemi’ license plate. While Dodge hasn’t announced any plans for a Hemi V8 in the new Charger, rumors from last month suggest that the iconic engine might be making a return in 2026, giving this rendering a whole new level of possibility.
