This LP770-4 SVJ has 9k miles and is now offered on dealer consignment with a window sticker, a battery charger, manufacturer’s literature, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title. The track-focused Aventador SVJ roadster was unveiled at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show and retains the larger air intakes, extended side skirts, revised aerodynamics, and the lighter exhaust system found on the SVJ coupe in addition to removable carbon-fiber roof panels. This example is finished in Verde Mantis, and additional features include carbon-fiber roof panels, bi-xenon headlights with washers, rear fog lights, heated and power-folding mirrors, and the Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva 2.0 active front air intake and aero-channel system. Forged 20″ and 21″ Leirion wheels were mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires in July 2023. The car is equipped with magnetic push-rod suspension and Electronic Stability Control (ESC). Stopping power is provided by green-painted multi-piston calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners. The brake system was serviced in March 2024. The cockpit is upholstered in Nero Cosmus leather and Alcantara with contrasting Verde Faunus stitching and accents. Features include power-adjustable heated seats, carbon-fiber door panels and trim, a Lamborghini infotainment system, a Lamborghini Sensonum sound system, and automatic climate control. The Alcantara-wrapped multi-function steering wheel frames a TFT LCD digital gauge cluster with a variable-redline tachometer, speed and fuel readouts, and auxiliary gauges for oil temperature and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 9k miles. The mid-mounted 6.5-liter V12 was rated at 759 horsepower at 8,500 rpm and 531 lb-ft of torque at 6,750 rpm. An oil change was performed in August 2024, and the spark plugs were replaced in September 2023. Power is sent to all four wheels through a seven-speed single-clutch ISR automated manual transmission and a Haldex all-wheel-drive system with a limited-slip rear differential.
