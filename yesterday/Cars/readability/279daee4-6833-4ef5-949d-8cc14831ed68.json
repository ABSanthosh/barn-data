However, the Italian marque isn’t concerned with the recent global slowdown in the EV demand and, on the contrary, sees it as an advantage. Speaking to the media and in response to a question from Autocar India, Lamborghini’s chief technical officer, Rouven Mohr, said, “It (EV slowdown) is working to our advantage and fitting perfectly to our strategy; customers are now asking for hybrids instead of electrics, and when the demand for full EVs comes, we will have our car ready.”  Indeed, with the introduction of the Revuelto, Urus SE and Temerario, Lamborghini has completely electrified (hybridised) its line-up, and its fully electric car is only due by late 2028 or early 2029. Furthermore, Mohr added that the company is being careful and not rushing to replace an existing model with an EV equivalent or even replace the powerplant with only an electric powertrain.  Lambo CTO Rouven Mohr   Hybridisation aids in handling, too Lamborghini has maintained that hybridisation has really helped elevate the driving experience, with the benefits of added power and also the instant torque boost or torque fill that electric motors provide, thus filling in nicely during an internal combustion engine’s dips in power. Mohr said there are benefits beyond these as well and cites the Revuelto as an example. “If you examine it, you will see that the two front motors are often called to duty to not just fill in power but as much for torque vectoring.” Given that an electric motor’s intervention can be far quicker and a lot more natural than a brake intervention, torque vectoring can enable sharper handling, as we experienced in our review of the car in December last year.  Mohr is also not concerned with battery material sourcing issues. “Given our small volumes and smaller material requirements with hybrids, the issue of battery materials isn’t as much of a problem for us,” he remarked. Thus, going ahead, the company is firmly focused on the hybrid route. “We want to continue with our hybridisation plans,” said Mohr.
