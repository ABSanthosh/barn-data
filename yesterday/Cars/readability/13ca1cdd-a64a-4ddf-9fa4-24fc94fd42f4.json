  "description": "Maharashtra has unveiled a bold new EV Policy 2025 designed to further accelerate the demand for electric mobility, which has witnessed strong growth over the past few years. The state Cabinet approved the new EV policy, which is effective for 5 years and has an allocation of Rs 1,993 crore – a 114 percent increase over the Rs 930 crore outlay that was part of the previous 4-year policy, which ended on March 31, 2025. With the new EV policy, the Maharashtra government is targeting a 30 percent EV adoption by 2030.  Maharashtra’s new EV policy has incentives of up to Rs 2 lakh for 4-wheel EVs EVs can also avail of toll-free travel on select expressways Maharashtra accounted for 12.52 percent of India’s FY2025 EV sales New Maharashtra EV Policy 2025: benefits for car buyers E-buses and 4-wheel EVs for transport or commercial use can avail benefits  As per the new EV policy, incentives of up to Rs 2 lakh can be availed on electric 4-wheelers used for transport, and for e-buses, benefits worth Rs 20 lakh are available. Up to 25,000 4-wheelers and 1,500 buses will get these incentives. It should be noted that while the previous policy had capped the benefits at Rs 1.75 lakh for privately owned electric 4-wheelers, this new policy specifically states incentives are for transport or commercial 4-wheelers only. Road tax and registration fee exemption continues As before, all EVs registered and sold in Maharashtra will continue to be exempted from motor vehicle tax and registration fees. To further promote zero-emission mobility in the state, the policy has made travel toll-free for all 4-wheeled passenger EVs and buses on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Mahamarg and Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (Atal Setu). Charging infrastructure mandate The policy also envisages the installation and availability of charging stations every 25 km on state and national highways to help alleviate EV users’ range anxiety. Further, the policy aims to have at least one EV charging station at every government office parking space and at least one community EV charging point in every new residential building. Meanwhile, new commercial buildings must allocate 50 percent of parking space for EV charging, but for older commercial properties, that requirement is 20 percent.   Maharashtra ranks second in EV sales in FY25 17,133 electric passenger vehicles (up 21 percent) sold in Maharashtra in FY2025 Maharashtra is home to several EV players, such as Tata Motors, Mahindra, Force Motors, Bajaj Auto, Kinetic Group and Piaggio, which have a manufacturing unit in the state. In the financial year that ended on March 31, 2025 (FY2025), the state was ranked second on the all-India EV ownership scale, with 2,46,221 units sold, comprising 12.52 percent of India’s EV sales. The state also has bragging rights for being No. 1 in e-2-wheelers, electric cars, e-SUVs and e-commercial vehicles. In India, 11,49,641 e-2-wheelers were sold in FY2025, and Maharashtra had the largest share of 18 percent with 2,11,880 units, up 15 percent year on year (YoY). Likewise, in electric cars, the state led the charge with 17,133 units (up 21 percent YoY), and it comprised 16 percent of the 1,07,782 e-passenger vehicles sold in India. The state accounted for 24 percent (2,104 units, up 24 percent) of the e-buses sold. In the ten calendar years since 2015, 7,13,986 EVs have been retailed in Maharashtra, shows data from Vahan.
