Now with 3,400 kilometers (~2,100 miles), the car is finished in Rosso Corsa with black and gold NART stripes as well as Scuderia Ferrari fender shields. It rides on magnetorheological dampers and is further equipped with gold-finished 20″ forged alloy wheels fitted over carbon-ceramic brakes at all four corners. Inside, carbon-fiber-backed bucket seats trimmed in black microsuede are accompanied by carbon-fiber trim. Power is supplied by a 4.5-liter DOHC V8 linked with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronic differential. Additional appointments include navigation, a rearview camera, and parking sensors. This 458 Speciale is now offered in Canada with a car cover, spare parts, service records, a clean Carfax report, and Ontario registration. The 458 was designed by Ferrari’s Donato Coco in collaboration with Pininfarina, and the Speciale model added an active horizontal front-end flap to divert air under the car, spring-loaded doors to direct air from the radiators at high speeds, aero fins on the side skirts, a motor-actuated drag-reduction system at the rear end, and a revised rear diffuser. This example is finished in Rosso Corsa with black and gold North American Racing Team (NART) stripes as well as Scuderia Ferrari fender shields. Xenon headlights up front are paired with LED taillights out back, and further equipment includes a rearview camera, parking sensors, and dual exhaust outlets. The side skirts and passenger mirror were refinished in 2021, at which time XPEL paint protection film and a Ceramic Pro ceramic coating were applied to the car. The gold-finished 20″ forged alloy wheels wear Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires measuring 245/35 at the front and 305/30 at the rear. The car is equipped with magnetorheological dampers, and braking is handled by black-finished Ferrari/Brembo calipers over cross-drilled carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners. The Speciale received a retuned Side Slip Angle Control system compared with the 458 Italia as well as F1-Trac traction control. The telemetry system was repaired and the front tire was replaced in 2021, while the brake fluid was flushed in 2025. Weight-saving measures on Speciale models included carbon-fiber door panels and dashboard trim as well as carbon-fiber seat frames. This example features carbon-fiber-backed bucket seats upholstered in black microsuede with synthetic inserts that are accented by embroidered prancing horses on the headrests and red stitching. Color-coordinated upholstery extends to the dash, center console, and door panels. Features include navigation, a CD stereo, dual-zone automatic climate control, and drilled aluminum pedals as well as a fire extinguisher stored in the passenger-side footwell. The passenger-side airbag was replaced in 2021. The flat-bottom steering wheel fronts column-mounted carbon-fiber shift paddles and features LED shift indicator lights as well as a red engine-start button and an adjustable manettino that toggles among several traction control and vehicle settings. Instrumentation consists of a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline flanked by two configurable displays. The digital odometer indicates 3,400 kilometers (~2,100 miles), approximately 700 of which were added under current ownership. The instrument panel software was updated in 2022. The mid-mounted 4.5-liter V8 was reworked for the Speciale with revised pistons, a 14:1 compression ratio, and a revised intake system and camshafts along with a carbon-fiber intake assembly. Factory-rated output was 605 horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque. The air filter and accessory belts were replaced in 2021, and the oil was changed in 2025. Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a Getrag seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronic differential. The differential fluid was flushed in preparation for the sale. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. Photo Gallery You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
