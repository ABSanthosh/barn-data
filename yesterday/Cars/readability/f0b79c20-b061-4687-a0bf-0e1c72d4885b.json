  "text": "This special CE 02 was created in partnership with an Australian clothing brand June 18, 2025 at 21:14 by Brad Anderson Deus Ex Machina collaborated with BMW to create a one-off CE 02 with DJ features. The special CE 02 features a custom leather saddle, Marshall speakers, and a turntable. BMW’s production bike is available with a single electric motor in 5 hp and 15 hp forms. BMW builds some of the finest motorcycles on the planet, including the retro-themed R 12 S and the all-conquering M 1000 RR. However, one of its latest bikes, the CE 02 is quite unlike any other. First introduced a couple of years ago, it’s compact, all-electric, and certainly looks the part. Now, an even sweeter version has been introduced, although it’ll likely remain a one-off. This particular CE 02 was born from a collaboration with Deus Ex Machina, the Australian brand that started out selling clothing, then pivoted to motorcycle customizing, and has since expanded into music and live events through Deus Records. Read: BMW Motorrad Teamed Up With Some Of Canada’s Best Builders On Three Custom R 18 Bikes The bike, known as the BMW Motorrad x Deus, is essentially a mobile DJ booth on two wheels, so it’d be perfect for cruising down Santa Monica pier in the summer. That’s if you could buy it, of course. Deus was tasked with creating a new leather saddle for the CE 02 and has installed four compact Marshall speakers and a foldable DJ turntable. Are you a born performer who gets the urge to start playing music and entertaining at the drop of a hat? Well, an electric bike like this would be perfect. BMW is currently touring the bike around France and will display it at various BMW Motorrad dealerships. Additionally, it will be showcased at Deus Ex Machina boutiques across the country. As mentioned, this special version of the CE 02 won’t be offered to shoppers, but it could serve as inspiration for owners who want to customize their own electric bikes. The CE 02 You Can Actually Buy If you’re looking to buy a CE 02, it starts at $7,599 in the States. Officially labeled as an electric scooter, it’s designed to be straddled like a motorcycle. It’s powered by a single electric motor that comes in two versions: 5 hp and 15 hp. The more powerful version goes from 0 to 30 mph (48 km/h) in just 3.0 seconds. The flagship model tops out at a modest 59 mph (95 km/h) and is equipped with two lithium-ion batteries that have a combined capacity of 1.96 kWh, giving it a range of around 59 miles (95 km). If you’re in a hurry to get back to the action, a quick charger will take it from 0 to 80% in 180 minutes. That’s plenty of time to grab a bite at a local food truck while you wait.",
