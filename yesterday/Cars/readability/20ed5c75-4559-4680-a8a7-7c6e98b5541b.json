  "description": "The first product from Vietnamese EV maker Vinfast to be assembled and sold in India will be the VF7. The brand, which has a wide range of products positioned both above and below the VF7, has chosen this as the debut model for India as it wanted to enter a competitive segment, while also playing its premium card first. Some brief time with the model at Vinfast’s factory testing track in Hai Phong, Vietnam, gave us a better idea of how it could be positioned in our market, and suffice it to say, there’s more to it than first meets the eye. 2025 Vinfast VF7 exterior design and engineering – 7/10 Full of interesting details, but estate-like form factor lacks presence. A design signature of all Vinfast models is the moustache-like ‘V Face’ LED DRL band that sits on the nose and dips in the centre underneath the brand’s logo. Viewed head on, this does make many of their models look similar to one another, particularly this and the VF6, but look closer and you’ll see unique touches in each of them. V-face LED DRL band is the signature element bringing a family look to Vinfast EVs. The VF7 gets a pair of brushed metal ‘blades’ in the front air dam, while the bumper itself has an indented or concave look. In fact, this muscular surfacing can be found all over the car, and on the side, flush door handles help give the sculpted doors a clean look. For India, the VF7 will get 19-inch wheels, and ground clearance has been raised to 190mm. Only when viewed in profile do you realise this is a 4.5-metre-long vehicle with a 2.8-metre wheelbase, though the front and rear overhangs are quite short. Vertically oriented tail-lamps with interesting details look attractive. At the rear, there’s more sculpture to the tailgate, a slim windscreen and attractive vertically oriented LED tail-lamps. While the details are excellent, its long and low-slung shape means it doesn’t quite have the road presence of a boxy SUV, or even the coupe-like look of its smaller sibling the VF6, which could work against it in India, where a more traditional form factor is generally preferred. 2025 Vinfast VF7 interior space and comfort – 8/10 Big on rear seat and boot space, quality generally good too. While it might not look large on the road, it certainly is on the inside. Under the powered tailgate you’ll find a capacious 537-litre boot, although there is no spare tyre. Rear seat space should endear it to chauffeur-driven owners, because both leg and head room are vast. Due to the high floor, you’re sat a bit knees-up, but you don’t feel it as much when you’re stretched out. Rear seat leg and head room are both vast; gets a reclining feature, too.  Speaking of which, new for the Indian model is the ability to recline the rear seat back a generous amount, and the cushioning is soft and supportive, especially for the lower back. The windows are long but slim and set quite high, although the sense of space is greatly enhanced by the huge fixed glass roof that stretches from edge to edge. Interior is clean and uncluttered; infotainment screen is angled towards driver. Up front, the VF7 replaces the traditional instrument cluster with a heads-up display (plus essential info as a permanent fixture in the touchscreen) to give an uninhibited view over the low-set dashboard. The 12.9-inch touchscreen takes pride of place, angled proud of the dash with a set of drive-select toggle switches below it. This, combined with the light-coloured, soft-touch vegan leather trimming the dash and doors gives it a unique and premium look, albeit one without much flash value. Fit and finish are good, although some dull and basic looking plastics are a distraction. Soft-touch vegan leather trimming on dashboard gives a premium feel.    2025 Vinfast VF7 features and safety – 9/10 Loaded with features and targeting a 5 star Bharat NCAP score. Vinfast has chosen to only launch a single fully loaded trim level called Plus, in India, as a competitive feature set was deemed a high priority. Features like the aforementioned rear-seat recline, a wireless phone charger, vegan leather, ventilated seats and one-litre bottle holders in each door were said to be non-negotiables. Seven airbags are also standard, as are a host of electronic safety aids, including a radar-based ADAS suite with Level 2 Autonomous driving, all in the quest, Vinfast says, to achieve a 5-star Bharat NCAP rating. Other feature highlights include dual-zone climate control and the big glass roof. Small icons and graphics on the screen make it difficult to use on the move. While there are a few physical controls in the centre console and on the steering wheel, most functions are relegated to the touchscreen. Though this is a common practice these days, what makes Vinfast’s system less than ideal is the small size of the icons and graphics on the screen, which are difficult to target while on the move. 2025 Vinfast VF7 range and efficiency – 6/10 Large battery holds promise, but low WLTP rating is a concern. While there is only one trim level and one battery size for the VF7, it will be offered with two powertrain options – single-motor FWD and dual-motor AWD. The battery is a 70.8kWh LFP unit which can be charged at up to 7.2kW on an AC charger or on a CCS2 DC charger, although speeds and times were not specified for the latter. European-spec VF7 has a maximum WLTP-certified range of 450km. Vinfast says the Indian-spec car has had some tweaks to its powertrain and thus it’s best to wait for official MIDC or ARAI range figures. However, the WLTP rating for overseas models is rated at 450km for the FWD model and 431km for the AWD model. 2025 Vinfast VF7 performance and refinement – 9/10 AWD version offers addictive acceleration, modes alter character well.

However, the version we got to sample was the dual-motor version, which adds another similar motor on the rear axle. Total outputs for this version are 350hp and 500Nm, which shreds the 0-100kph sprint down to just 5.8sec. In practice, it feels genuinely fast, even spinning up its wheels under hard acceleration from low speeds. The ferocity of the power delivery starts to taper off close to about 120kph, but it will hold those speeds with ease. The good news is that it is civilised and manageable at low speeds, making it suitable for city driving too. The VF7 is genuinely fast, even spinning up its wheels under hard acceleration. Refinement was hard to judge on the relatively smooth expanse of Vinfast’s test track but the requisite electronic whine in the cabin was a welcome indicator of the power being deployed. The brakes felt strong and confidence inspiring, and the VF7 AWD’s not-inconsiderable 2.2-tonne mass was kept well in check. 2025 Vinfast VF7 ride comfort and handling – 8/10 Feels solid and confidence inspiring at high speeds. The dynamic capabilities of the VF7 were also hard to ascertain on the smooth track with almost no corners present. However, the general sense was of a secure and planted vehicle in the vein of what we’ve come to expect from European cars. The choice to move down a size from 20-inch to 19-inch wheels and tyres (Apollo tyres, no less) seems to have been the right one, as there is a degree of absorption that perhaps would have been lacking with the upsize. It feels secure and planted at high-speeds, almost European-like.  The longer wheelbase of the VF7 appeared to give it a greater sense of stability at high speeds than the VF6, if perhaps robbing it of a bit of handling playfulness in the process. That said, the drive modes did well to add (or remove) steering weight for the desired driving conditions. 2025 Vinfast VF7 price and verdict – 8/10 If priced aggressively, it could be a unique proposition in India. While the Vinfast VF7’s estate-like form factor might not be to everyone’s tastes, those seeking substance over style will appreciate it. The rear seat and boot are incredibly spacious, making this a great car for families or the chauffeur driven. Plus there’s the AWD version for those who like the occasional hit of performance on their Sunday drive. With local assembly from the get go, Vinfast is expected to go aggressive with the price, and we expect it to be in the region of Rs 25 lakh (ex-showroom) for the FWD version, going up to about Rs 29 lakh for the dual-motor AWD version. With the features and safety kit on offer, that should make it very competitive. Upon launch, prices are expected to range between Rs 25 lakh-29 lakh (ex-showroom). Whether in look, spec or character, the VF7 is a unique proposition for the Indian market, and perhaps that’s exactly what new entrant Vinfast needs to make people sit up and take notice. We’ll know more when the VF7 (followed closely by the VF6) goes on sale in India in the festive season of 2025.

However, the version we got to sample was the dual-motor version, which adds another similar motor on the rear axle. Total outputs for this version are 350hp and 500Nm, which shreds the 0-100kph sprint down to just 5.8sec.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn practice, it feels genuinely fast, even spinning up its wheels under hard acceleration from low speeds.
