  "description": "This 1965 Honda S600 roadster was acquired by the seller around 1988, and it underwent body repairs and a repaint in the 2000s before being mechanically refurbished a decade later. Power comes from a 606cc inline-four with quadruple carburetors, while shifting is through a four-speed manual transmission linked with a chain-drive system. Further equipment includes a black soft top, black vinyl upholstery, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, an independent suspension, and 13” wheels. This S600 is now offered with transferable New York registration.",

  "text": "This 1965 Honda S600 roadster was acquired by the seller around 1988, and it underwent body repairs and a repaint in the 2000s before being mechanically refurbished a decade later. Power comes from a 606cc inline-four with quadruple carburetors, while shifting is through a four-speed manual transmission linked with a chain-drive system. Further equipment includes a black soft top, black vinyl upholstery, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, an independent suspension, and 13” wheels. This S600 is now offered with transferable New York registration. The body was removed from the frame during a refurbishment in 2005, and the floors and spare tire well are said to have been replaced before a repaint in red. Exterior details include a black soft top, fender-mounted side mirrors, and wraparound bumpers. The seller notes pitting on the exterior brightwork, streaks on the left side of the windshield, and paint chips and bubbles that can be viewed in the gallery. Silver-finished 13” wheels wear polished hubcaps and are wrapped in 145-series Dunlop SP 20 A/S tires with 2001 production date codes. The car rides on a fully independent suspension with front torsion bars and rear coil springs, and braking is handled by finned drums at all four corners. The cabin features bucket seats trimmed in black vinyl accompanied by red lap belts. Cracks in the dash pad and deterioration on the door panels can be viewed in the gallery. The seller notes that the windshield washer reservoir is missing, and the choke cable does not hold its position. The wood-rimmed steering wheel fronts DENSO instrumentation consisting of a 120-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 9,500-rpm redline, and gauges for coolant temperature, amperage, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 41k miles, approximately 1k of which have been added under current ownership. Black bedliner material has been applied to the trunk floor as well as the underside of the hood and trunklid. The 606cc DOHC inline-four features quadruple Keihin side-draft carburetors. The seller states that the car underwent a multi-year mechanical refurbishment at Formula H Motorworks that was completed in 2014. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and dual outboard chain-drive assemblies. The vehicle is being sold on its transferable registration, which serves as the ownership document in New York. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
