  "description": "This Success Story comes to us from 500K36, who won this 1995 Talbo Series I coupe from FantasyJunction in a September 2023 BaT auction: It has been a few months since I won this 1995 Talbo Series I coupe on BaT, and I love the car! I have not seen any other examples of this ultra-low-production tribute car inspired by the 1938 Talbot-Lago “Teardrop” coupe up for sale since, so that helped justify the purchase price. Thanks to BaT for bringing me one of the cars I had been looking for for several years. In the end I was competing with one other bidder for it, and this just shows why BaT is a great place for sellers and a great place to find rare cars.",

I have not seen any other examples of this ultra-low-production tribute car inspired by the 1938 Talbot-Lago “Teardrop” coupe up for sale since, so that helped justify the purchase price. Thanks to BaT for bringing me one of the cars I had been looking for for several years. In the end I was competing with one other bidder for it, and this just shows why BaT is a great place for sellers and a great place to find rare cars. There was quite a bit of speculation about why the headliner was such a mess; it turned out that mice had made several nests, and it was the final resting place for a couple of them. As such, the interior smelled quite mousey—dead mousey, in fact. I just got the car back with a new Alcantara headliner, new carpet (back to its original color), and a richer-colored leather interior, replacing the original worn beige leather and sagging door pockets. I also removed the doo-dads from the grille; I’m all for collecting automobilia, but to me the badges detracted from the design of the car. A race car builder found the rear suspension “ridiculously stiff, even for a track car.” The basically non-functional transverse leaf was replaced with coilovers, and it rides much better now. The original designer and builder told me that he had changed the later cars to coilovers, as it was a significant improvement. I performed additional research before and after the sale that showed the actual mileage to be around 20,000, as I suspected, despite the odometer being inoperative since 2009 or early 2010. It’s working again now, so this car is ready for years of enjoyment. I get thumbs-up everywhere I drive it. The car had been featured on Elliot Cuker’s stand at the 1995 New York Auto Show. If anyone reading this can help me find a photo of this car at the show, I’d really appreciate it! I took the car out on the Circuit of the Americas track, and despite not being allowed to drive over 60 mph, it was a fun car to take out on the track. It’s so eye-catching that a couple came up to me at the show and asked where I lived. It turns out that we’re neighbors, just a half mile away from each other! We have lived there for many years, and it took this car for us to be introduced. My years of watching BaT really paid off by catching this one-of-22 car. If you have a Success Story about a car you’ve bought or sold on BaT, please send a few lines and pictures (or a video) to community.content@bringatrailer.com, and we’ll send you a $50 credit to the BaT Gear Store when your story posts to the site, as well as a complimentary charger from our friends at Battery Tender to keep you cruising all year! We love to hear from satisfied BaT buyers and sellers, and a Success Story feature is a great addition to any car’s history when you’re ready to sell.",
