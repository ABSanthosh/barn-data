Finished in US Department of Forestry Green over Mocha vinyl upholstery, the truck is powered by a 5.0-liter V8 linked with a four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive and a dual-range transfer case. It features a limited-slip rear differential, manually locking front hubs, 15″ steel wheels, revised springs and shocks, an AM/FM stereo, and air conditioning. This Bronco Custom is offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner with service records, manufacturer’s literature, a clean Carfax report, and a New Hampshire title. The truck is finished in US Department of Forestry Green (W7603), and exterior details include a receiver hitch, a swing-away spare tire carrier, and a drop-down tailgate. Paintwork has been applied to the lower body panels and rust repair to the rear quarter panel was performed in 2006. The seller notes corrosion, paint bubbling, and a chip in the windshield. Close-up photographs of exterior blemishes are shown in the gallery below. The 15″ steel wheels feature finned covers and are fitted with 235/75 Firestone Destination tires that were mounted in 2024. Revised springs and shocks are said to have been fitted specifically for the US Department of Forestry, and the truck is equipped with optional locking front hubs and power-assisted front disc brakes. The cabin features front captain’s chairs and a rear bench upholstered in Mocha vinyl along with a color-coordinated dashboard, door panels, and carpeting. Interior amenities include an AM/FM stereo, hand-crank windows, and air conditioning, the latter of which was recharged in 2022. Holes in the flooring between the front seats and cracked seat belt trim are noted by the seller. The two-spoke steering wheel frames an 85-mph speedometer and gauges for oil pressure, voltage, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer shows 151k miles, approximately 74k of which were added under current ownership. The 5.0-liter V8 was factory rated at 185 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. The alternator was replaced in 2021. Power is delivered to the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive, a dual-range transfer case, and a limited-slip rear differential. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. The New Hampshire title is in transit. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
