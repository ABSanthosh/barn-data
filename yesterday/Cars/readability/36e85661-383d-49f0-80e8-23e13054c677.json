  "description": "Almost a decade after it first came out, the Bajaj Pulsar RS200 has got its first update, and even then, it’s a rather minor one. Priced at Rs 1.84 lakh, an increase of Rs 10,000 from earlier, the RS200 now gets a new tail-lamp design, the same colour LCD dash as the NS400Z, riding modes and a slipper clutch.  Pulsar RS200’s new tail-lamp integrates stop light and indicators Updated bike uses the same colour LCD dash as the Pulsar NS400Z It also gets a slipper clutch and three riding modes now Bajaj Pulsar RS200: What’s new? Not a lot. The Pulsar RS200 remains largely unchanged visually, but Bajaj has given it a brand-new tail-lamp that now uses two separate pods on each side. Each pod combines the indicator and tail-lamp into a single unit, similar to something seen on premium BMW and Harley-Davidson bikes. The rest of the design stays exactly the same, and the RS200 is available in three colours: black, white and red. The Pulsar RS200 is now also endowed with the same colour LCD dash and switchgear as seen on the Pulsar NS400Z, which means you get Bluetooth connectivity for turn-by-turn navigation and call/notification alerts. Along with that, Bajaj has also thrown in three riding modes: Off-Road, Road and Rain. Apart from these updates, the Pulsar RS200 remains unchanged. It continues to be powered by the same liquid-cooled, 199cc, single-cylinder motor that produces 24.5hp at  9,750rpm and 18.7Nm at 8,000rpm and is mated to a 6-speed gearbox with a slipper clutch.  At Rs 1.84 lakh, the updated Bajaj Pulsar RS200 costs a considerable Rs 10,000 more than before and competes with much more modern offerings like the Hero Karizma XMR (Rs 1.81 lakh) and the Yamaha R15 V4 (Rs 1.84 lakh - Rs 2.11 lakh). And at its new price, the RS200 sits almost on par with the much more powerful Pulsar NS400Z, which costs Rs 1.85 lakh.
