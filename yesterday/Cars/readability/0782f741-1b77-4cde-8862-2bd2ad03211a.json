  "description": "The Volkswagen entry-level EV has been teased officially for the first time ahead of its debut. This new model from the German brand will be an all-electric successor to the now discontinued Up hatchback.  Entry-level VW EV could be called ID.One upon debut It will get a raised and rugged, crossover-like design It will get a front-mounted motor, a smaller battery pack than the ID.2 Entry-level Volkswagen EV will use a shortened MEB platform This new Volkswagen EV will be positioned below the Volkswagen ID.2all hatchback. Likely to be called ID.One or ID.1, this new EV is expected to be a five-door model with a slightly raised stance and body cladding to give it some musculature. It will be one of nine new models to debut by 2027, expanding the brand's global all-electric lineup. The teaser shows rectangular headlamps with 3D LED graphics neatly integrated in the black grille along with an illuminated VW logo. The entry-level EV also sports slim vertical DRLs on the front bumper and mildly sculpted fenders.  This new entry-level VW EV will be built on the MEB platform, shared with ID.2all hatchback, though it'll be a shortened version. The smaller EV is likely to get a single motor setup and a compact battery pack to keep costs in check. The same underpinnings and powertrain are also expected to be used the entry-level Skoda and Seat EVs aimed at the European market. Volkswagen CEO Thomas Schäfer celebrated the new car as a pivotal moment for the company, saying, \"An affordable, high-quality, and profitable electric Volkswagen from Europe for Europe: that's the Champions League of automotive engineering!” The production facility that will build the entry-level Volkswagen EV has not been finalised yet. The ID.2all and the ID.2X crossover will be built by the Volkswagen Group in Spain, alongside the Skoda Epiq and the Cupra Raval SUVs. Volkswagen technical development boss Kai Grünitz had previously suggested the new entry model will be an obvious successor to the successful Up hatchback in its conception, and will share some design elements and attributes. Volkswagen EVs for India While there is no word on this entry-level VW EV making its way to India, the German brand is working on bringing EVs to the market based on a localised version of the CMP architecture. Development of the IMP, or ‘India Main Platform’ for EVs – which is a derivative of the CMP (China Main Platform) with strong localised elements – has already begun and a compact electric SUV and a midsize SUV are planned.
