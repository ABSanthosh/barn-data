  "text": "Rumored to be backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Slate Auto has already teased three different body styles of its debut EV 1 hour ago by John Halas Slate Auto is reportedly developing a $25,000 EV, with a late 2026 release scheduled. We‚Äôve already seen a two-door pickup and two different three-door SUV variants. The company has yet to share any official details but plans to drop info on April 24. Update: As expected, Slate Auto‚Äôs guerrilla-style marketing campaign is picking up steam, with the EV startup continuing to build buzz for its debut model with unconventional tactics. Following the recent sighting of its two-door pickup truck, a TikTok video from TheManiFamily account has now revealed a second variant. This time, the vehicle in question is a three-door SUV version of the truck, complete with a slanted rear window hatch. With design cues reminiscent of older Range Rovers, it feels like a modern, more compact take on the original three-door Range Rover Classic from the ‚Äô70s and ‚Äô80s. Some might even notice similarities to the upcoming Rivian R3, which shares some styling elements, particularly the hatchback crossover shape. However, Slate Auto‚Äôs still-unnamed model clearly leans more toward utility. The short video posted on TikTok seems to be another piece of the playful campaign, featuring a fake cat therapist company called TheFelineTherapist. The clip includes a link to a website, CatThurrrapy, which, unsurprisingly, reveals that Slate Auto is behind the entire ruse. But wait, there‚Äôs more. TheAutopian also caught wind of a third version of the vehicle, a boxier, two-door SUV that‚Äôs practically a love letter to ‚Äì you guessed it ‚Äì the Land Rover Defender. Further details are set to be released on April 24, so stay tuned for more. Original story follows below. üî¥ ùêÑùêóùêÇùêãùêîùêíùêàùêïùêÑ: A new American electric vehicle company is coming. New automaker Slate shares the first public photos of its upcoming EV, wrapped in Newsweek camouflage. pic.twitter.com/JVfeBzYby4‚Äî Newsweek (@Newsweek) April 15, 2025 An electric pickup truck has sparked curiosity online after a photo surfaced of a camouflaged two-door truck being offloaded from a flatbed in Los Angeles. The timing couldn‚Äôt be more interesting: news also broke that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is quietly backing a Michigan-based EV startup called Slate Auto, which claims it‚Äôs developing a $25,000 electric model in the form of a compact, two-door pickup. More: Jeff Bezos Secretly Backs EV Maker Building A $25K Pickup For The Masses Photo TheManiFamily / TikTok Reddit / Discostranger09 The image, posted to Reddit by user Discostranger09, shows the pickup truck being unloaded from a shipping container just outside their office. The flatbed truck is marked with the name ‚ÄúTime Towing LLC,‚Äù though there may be an additional word obscured at the front of the logo. The original poster didn‚Äôt offer much more than that, though commentators said the photo was likely taken somewhere in Los Angeles. From what‚Äôs visible, the vehicle looks like a mashup of an older Range Rover and a Jeep Renegade‚Äîboxy, upright, and unapologetically stubby. The absence of a grille opening at the front suggests its electric, reinforced by what appears to be a charging port near the rear corner. A quick image search doesn‚Äôt match it to anything currently on the market, though admittedly, that‚Äôs far from definitive. Is This Slate Auto‚Äôs First Prototype? Naturally, Redditors were quick to speculate. The most popular theory is that this mystery truck is Slate Auto‚Äôs debut model, possibly caught during testing or transport. Others floated ideas ranging from a Rivian prototype to a one-off custom build, though no solid evidence has surfaced to support any theory just yet. What We Know About Slate Auto Slate Auto remains mostly under wraps, with limited information available beyond a recent TechCrunch report. According to that story, the company was quietly formed in 2022 as a spinout of Bezos‚Äô investment in Re:Build Manufacturing. Since then, it‚Äôs been building out its team in Detroit, recruiting talent from legacy automakers like Ford, GM, and Stellantis, as well as from floundering EV startups such as Fisker and Canoo. Their goal? A $25,000, two-door, two-seat electric pickup aimed at a late 2026 release. While Slate Auto hasn‚Äôt confirmed anything about the vehicle, they‚Äôve announced that more news is coming on April 24. Whether that will include a formal reveal or just more corporate breadcrumbs remains to be seen. In the meantime, we‚Äôll keep digging to see what else we can uncover about the truck in question. If you recognize it‚Äîor if you‚Äôre the one who built it in your garage over a long weekend‚Äîdrop us a line. Photo Slate / Newsweek",
