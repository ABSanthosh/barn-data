Powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.8L flat-six linked with a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle, it has the $18k Weissach Package, the Sport Chrono Package, 20″ and 21″ magnesium center-lock wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes, yellow brake calipers, a front-axle lift system, Porsche Dynamic Light System (PDLS), rear-axle steering, a rear wing, and a limited-slip differential. Its interior features carbon-fiber full bucket seats, Porsche Communication Management (PCM), navigation, air conditioning, and a Bose sound system. The vehicle was acquired new by its current owner, and it has 5k miles. Previously listed on BaT in December 2022, this 991 GT2 RS is now offered by the seller with a window sticker, an owner’s manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New Jersey title in the owner’s name. Weight savings were targeted with the GT2 RS program, and Porsche fitted multiple carbon-fiber components including the hood, front fender vents, side intakes, mirror caps, and rear wing. The Weissach Package reduces weight further through the use of carbon fiber for the roof panel and the anti-roll bars. Downforce is increased with a large rear wing, underbody diffuser, and a deeper front fascia, while NACA ducts in the front trunk lid aid in brake cooling. On this unit, paint protection film is noted on the front bumper, hood, and fenders. The car is equipped with adjustable dampers and anti-roll bars, Porsche Active Suspension Management, Porsche Stability Management, rear-axle steering, and Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes with yellow calipers and cross-drilled rotors. Its satin black 20″ and 21″ magnesium center-lock wheels were mounted in June 2024 with 265/35 front and 325/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires, at which time the brake fluid was flushed. The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are upholstered in black leather with red Alcantara inserts, Weissach embroidery on the headrests, and red stitching that extends to the dash and door panels. Carbon-fiber trim accents the interior, which has aluminum pedal covers, air conditioning, a CD stereo, a Bose sound system, cruise control, a fire extinguisher, the Light Design Package, and PCM infotainment with navigation. The three-spoke steering wheel features lightweight shift paddles, and it frames a 250-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline, and gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The optional Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The odometer indicates 5k miles. Factory rated at 700 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque, the twin-turbocharged 3.8L flat-six has a carbon-fiber engine cover, an intercooler spray system, an extended-range 23.7-gallon fuel tank, and a titanium rear exhaust muffler. It sends power to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and a limited-slip differential with Porsche Torque Vectoring. An annual service with an oil change was most recently completed in June 2024. Additional photographs of the underside are shown in the gallery below. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Porsche Princeton of Lawrenceville, New Jersey, along with colors, equipment, and a total price of $348,670.
