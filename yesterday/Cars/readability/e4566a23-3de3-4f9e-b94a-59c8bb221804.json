Sure, there are plenty of places to buy motorcycles, but none cater to customization. BringaTrailer tends to scoff at diversions from OE hardware, and eBay often feels like the Wild West, where anything goes and the thing you’re looking for is lost in a sea of related goods. And let’s not even touch on Facebook Marketplace… We’re fortunate enough to be hardwired into the scene, with great contacts in the industry and an eye for presentation, and recently launched the Bike EXIF Classifieds to serve as a home for the best classic and custom motorcycles available worldwide. With a couple of pages of listings live, we decided to round up a few of our favorites for your consideration. 1980 BMW R100 RS by Cafe Racer Dreams Cafe Racer Dreams has proven the versatility of BMW airheads time and time again. If you want a cafe racer, they’ve got you. If you’re after more of a desert racer, they have that covered as well. If you’re looking for something in the middle, this 1979 R100 RS gets my vote—dubbed CRD2020. After a thorough mechanical restoration, CRD started to hone in on a vision for the project, and the first big change was a complete suspension swap. The new inverted front end was borrowed from a Kawasaki ZX-6R, and the rear end consists of the finest from Öhlins’ Black Line. The Continental TKC 80 tires may be a bridge too far on a bike with clip-on bars and rear-set controls, but we think it looks stellar and gives the bike rugged character. Stopping power should be second to none with the use of dual 310 mm front rotors with Brembo calipers. CRD retained the R100’s chiseled stock tank, and it pairs well with their custom two-up leather seat. Modern controls were carried over from the ZX-6R and a full suite of motogadget’s gear was used, including lighting, grips, mirrors and a motoscope pro display. CRD2020 is a rugged mix of old and new, brimming with character, and it has just 800 km on the clock. Consider it a second break-in, and this one’s ready for a lifetime of fun. 2015 BMW S10000RR by Revival Cycles Admittedly connoisseurs of classics, Revival Cycles had never considered modern sport bikes to be their thing—until they rode BMW’s S1000RR. On one hand, it’s a track-caliber, 200-hp machine capable of nearly 190 mph, but it was how easily the bike handled at track speeds, and how docile it could be that sold them. Once bitten, Revival needed to get their hands on an S1000RR, but obviously it couldn’t remain stock. Revival saw the bike as a perfect candidate for an inspired track-day machine that anyone could hop on. It’s equipped with trick DDC electronic suspension, gearshift assist, loads of traction control and performance settings, so suffice it to say that Revival didn’t feel it was necessary to reinvent the wheel performance-wise. After an ECU flash, a stainless header-back exhaust and Hayes billet calipers up front, it was time for a dramatic visual transformation. Taking inspiration from various track machines of the 1980s and ’90s, Revival set about replacing the RR’s plastics with more inspired aluminum shapes. A new subframe was constructed and an aluminum tail section to go with. The top of the fuel tank was cut off and reshaped to hold a full 6 gallons of fuel for endurance racing. Upon the completion of the bellypan, front and side fairings, the bike was finished in a functional sense, but still wasn’t quite up to Revival’s standards. The bike was torn back down to remove the factory black finish on the frame, and it was sanded to a smooth finish to match the bodywork. From there, Revival called on Nico Sclater (aka Ornamental Conifer) to apply the bike’s nostalgic hand-painted livery. Seen around Europe and the U.K., and thoroughly tested at Circuit of the Americas, rest assured this BMW S1000RR goes as good as it looks. 2006 Honda CRF450X by Deus Ex Machina “…doing something is more fun than just owning something.” This partial quote from Deus Ex Machina resonates with us, as we feel there’s an obvious difference between those who buy a piece of machinery and those who immerse themselves in it. Beyond the typical spit-and-polish shows, Dues focuses on events that foster a connection with motorcycles, and nothing forces you to learn your machine quite like competition. From their efforts in the SCORE World Desert Championship, Dues found they were flush with spare parts, and put them to good use prepping this 2006 CRF450X for desert racing. The 450’s engine was treated to a full build, with a new camshaft, porting and polishing by Boyko Racing and final assembly at AHM Factory Services. Linked to the driveline with a Rekluse clutch and breathing through a full FMF system, the 18-year-old mill was up to the task. AHM then turned their attention to the suspension, reworking the front end with gold lowers and late-model legs, and both ends were fine-tuned for the desert. The brakes were upgraded to the finest gear from Ride Engineering and Dirt Tricks, and the OE wheels were stuffed with Nitromousse foam inserts to prevent flats. For max hook-up, Dues installed a set of Michelin StarCross 6 tires. The 450’s purpose-driven bodywork combines OE and aftermarket parts with a Thrill Seekers saddle and an IMS fuel tank for extended range and faster fill-ups. If the event goes into the night, the 450 is equipped with a high-output stator for running race lights, and a Baja Designs ignition provides the spark. Finished just two weeks before its debut, the CRF powered the Dues team to a third-place finish in the 2024 Golden State 250 in the pro class. Not bad at all for an old bike, but then again, this one’s new throughout, and ready for its next outing. Valiance by PowerBrick Dutch parts specialist and custom shop Powerbrick has become synonymous with the BMW K-series, and for good reason. We featured our first Powerbrick BMW in 2022, and since then, company founder Tim Somers has continually refined his style and craftsmanship to factory standards. Exotic materials, a stock fuel tank and a big inline-four hanging in the breeze are all hallmarks of a Powerbrick BMW, and there are perhaps none finer than Valiance. One of the most impactful features of the bike has to be the subframe. It’s machined from a solid chunk of billet aluminum, and positions the sharp custom saddle in perfect alignment with the K1100’s fuel tank. That aggressive line is set, in part, by the front end from a BMW S1000RR superbike, fitted with Öhlins NIX30 cartridges and anodized red. Finished with clip-ons and rear-set pegs, Valiance has a purposeful stance and ergonomics befitting such a unique mill. While the size and orientation of the K1100’s engine make a heck of a statement on their own, Powerbrick wasn’t keen to leave well enough alone and overhauled the four-cylinder with performance porting, Bosch injectors and NGK ignition. A row of custom-branded DNA filters tuck up under the tank and exhaust gasses expel through hand-welded stainless steel headers and a Powerbrick muffler. Another component that gives Valiance such a unique look is the front fairing. It’s 3D-printed in a carbon compound material with a CNC-machined bracket for mounting, and flows effortlessly from the Koso LED back into the BMW fuel tank. Complete with a set of forged carbon wheels from Rotobox, Valiance wholly encapsulates an aesthetic that can only be described as Powerbrick. Knievel by Freeland Motorcycles Equal parts daredevil and entertainer, Evel Knievel is revered for his gravity-defying exploits as much as the promotion and flash that surrounded his stunts. Evel was the king of cool and inspired decades of gearheads to push their boundaries on two wheels. Like the man who inspired its creation, Freeland Motorcycle’s CJ360 ‘Knievel’ build is a flashy machine just begging for old-school shenanigans. While the bike looks like a fairly standard build from afar, there’s some trickery afoot when you dig in. Freeland ditched the CJ360 engine and replaced it with a similar unit from a CL. The engines perform about the same, but the Scrambler engine has a sixth gear and electric start. Fit with a scrambler exhaust, 14-inch rear shocks and the front end from an SL350, the Knievel successfully ditches its road-going geometry for something a bit more adventurous. After stripping back all the stock bodywork, Freeland whipped up a nostalgic bare-bones combo starting with a custom-painted Benelli Mojave fuel tank and a handmade saddle with an integrated pillion pad. Where some are tempted to break character with tapered bars and modern controls, Freeland kept it vintage with chrome bars, cable-operated levers and a 5.75-inch round headlight. Freeland’s Knievel is crafted with a modern aesthetic without forgetting its roots. It’s the kind of machine that provides accessible nostalgic thrills out in the dirt, with enough showmanship to grab attention around town—the king would approve.",

Finished with clip-ons and rear-set pegs, Valiance has a purposeful stance and ergonomics befitting such a unique mill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/powerbrick-classifieds-6-745x497.jpg\" alt=\"Valiance BMW K1100 by Powerbrick on Bike EXIF Classifieds\" width=\"745\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/powerbrick-classifieds-6-745x497.jpg 745w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/powerbrick-classifieds-6-420x280.jpg 420w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/powerbrick-classifieds-6-180x120.jpg 180w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/powerbrick-classifieds-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/powerbrick-classifieds-6-570x380.jpg 570w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/powerbrick-classifieds-6-135x90.jpg 135w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/powerbrick-classifieds-6-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/powerbrick-classifieds-6-258x172.jpg 258w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/powerbrick-classifieds-6-360x240.jpg 360w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/powerbrick-classifieds-6-720x480.jpg 720w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/powerbrick-classifieds-6-275x183.jpg 275w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/powerbrick-classifieds-6-150x100.jpg 150w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/powerbrick-classifieds-6.jpg 1490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\"/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\nWhile the size and orientation of the K1100’s engine make a heck of a statement on their own, Powerbrick wasn’t keen to leave well enough alone and overhauled the four-cylinder with performance porting, Bosch injectors and NGK ignition. A row of custom-branded DNA filters tuck up under the tank and exhaust gasses expel through hand-welded stainless steel headers and a Powerbrick muffler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother component that gives Valiance such a unique look is the front fairing. It’s 3D-printed in a carbon compound material with a CNC-machined bracket for mounting, and flows effortlessly from the Koso LED back into the BMW fuel tank. Complete with a set of forged carbon wheels from Rotobox, Valiance wholly encapsulates an aesthetic that can only be described as Powerbrick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-2-745x498.jpg\" alt=\"Knievel by Freeland Motorcycles on Bike EXIF Classifieds\" width=\"745\" height=\"498\" srcset=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-2-745x498.jpg 745w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-2-420x280.jpg 420w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-2-180x120.jpg 180w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-2-768x513.jpg 768w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-2-569x380.jpg 569w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-2-135x90.jpg 135w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-2-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-2-258x172.jpg 258w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-2-360x240.jpg 360w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-2-720x481.jpg 720w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-2-275x184.jpg 275w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-2-150x100.jpg 150w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-2.jpg 1490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\"/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eKnievel by Freeland Motorcycles\u003c/strong\u003e Equal parts daredevil and entertainer, Evel Knievel is revered for his gravity-defying exploits as much as the promotion and flash that surrounded his stunts. Evel was the king of cool and inspired decades of gearheads to push their boundaries on two wheels. Like the man who inspired its creation, Freeland Motorcycle’s \u003ca href=\"https://shop.bikeexif.com/products/knievel-by-freeland-motorcycles\"\u003eCJ360 ‘Knievel’ build\u003c/a\u003e is a flashy machine just begging for old-school shenanigans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the bike looks like a fairly standard build from afar, there’s some trickery afoot when you dig in. \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/freelandmotorcycles/?hl=en\"\u003eFreeland\u003c/a\u003e ditched the CJ360 engine and replaced it with a similar unit from a CL. The engines perform about the same, but the Scrambler engine has a sixth gear and electric start. Fit with a scrambler exhaust, 14-inch rear shocks and the front end from an SL350, the Knievel successfully ditches its road-going geometry for something a bit more adventurous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-1-745x497.jpg\" alt=\"Knievel by Freeland Motorcycles on Bike EXIF Classifieds\" width=\"745\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-1-745x497.jpg 745w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-1-420x280.jpg 420w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-1-180x120.jpg 180w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-1-570x380.jpg 570w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-1-135x90.jpg 135w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-1-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-1-258x172.jpg 258w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-1-360x240.jpg 360w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-1-720x480.jpg 720w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-1-275x183.jpg 275w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freeland-motorcycles-knievel-1.jpg 1490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\"/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\nAfter stripping back all the stock bodywork, Freeland whipped up a nostalgic bare-bones combo starting with a custom-painted Benelli Mojave fuel tank and a handmade saddle with an integrated pillion pad. Where some are tempted to break character with tapered bars and modern controls, Freeland kept it vintage with chrome bars, cable-operated levers and a 5.75-inch round headlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreeland’s Knievel is crafted with a modern aesthetic without forgetting its roots.
