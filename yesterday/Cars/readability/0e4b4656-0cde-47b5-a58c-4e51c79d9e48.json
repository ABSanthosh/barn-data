  "description": "Copenhagen is consistently ranked among the world’s most liveable cities, thanks to its pristine environment, unpolluted air and passion for sustainable urban living. It’s fitting, then, that Mercedes-Benz chose the clean Danish capital as the venue for the media drive of its latest electric car – the all-new CLA Electric. More than just another EV, it’s a showcase of the brand’s cutting-edge technology, wrapped in compact luxury. And for Indian buyers seeking to go green without giving up on prestige or performance, the CLA arrives at the end of this year as a truly compelling proposition. Mercedes-Benz CLA: exterior design and engineering Mercedes-Benz CLA dimensionsLength4,723mmWidth (w/o mirrors)1,855mmHeight 1,468mmWheelbase 2,790mmBoot volume 405-litres Frunk Volume 101-litres Kerb weight 2,055-2,135kg At its core lies the new Modular Architecture (MMA) – an EV-first platform ingeniously engineered to accommodate combustion engines and hybrid powertrains as well. It’s a quiet admission from Mercedes, once bullish about going all-electric by 2030, that customer sentiment has taken a different route. The road to electrification is a long one, especially in markets like India, where EV penetration is still under 5 percent. The CLA is underpinned by Mercedes' EV-first MMA architecture. The genius of the CLA Electric’s powertrain lies in its relentless pursuit of efficiency. Unlike most single-speed EVs, the in-house-developed, rear-mounted motor is paired with a two-speed gearbox. While this may seem counterintuitive for an EV, its goal is clear: to maximise efficiency across a broad speed range. While Porsche’s Taycan uses a two-speed for brutal acceleration, the CLA uses it to squeeze out every last kilometre. By optimising the motor's operating point, the extra ratio delivers a more sustained power band and improved efficiency – key to achieving its standout range. This allows Mercedes to fit a smaller, lighter battery, which in turn means faster charging, lower costs and fewer precious materials used. Sleek design gives it a drag coefficient of just 0.21. Completing the efficiency puzzle are the car’s exceptional aerodynamics. Electric Mercs have always been slick, but the CLA pushes the envelope with a drag coefficient of just 0.21. That’s thanks to features like flush door handles, and aero covers on the wheels and even the suspension arms. Every curve is sculpted to cut drag, helping the CLA deliver range figures rivalling larger and far more expensive EVs like the EQS or long-range BMW iX. The CLA has always been a design-first sedan, and the new electric version retains its distinctive four-door coupe silhouette. A 61mm stretch in the wheelbase improves interior space, while the low-slung, wide and athletic stance remains intact. Sealed-off grille is studded with 142 illuminated Mercedes stars. The shark-nose front panel – replacing the ICE CLA’s grille – is studded with 142 illuminated Mercedes stars and animated with playful welcome and goodbye sequences. Star-shaped Daytime Running Lamps and connected tail-lights complete a distinctive, high-tech look. One concern for India: the Euro-spec ground clearance is just 107mm. Great for autobahns, not for our speed breakers; a higher-riding Indian version is expected, and necessary. Mercedes-Benz CLA: interior space and comfort The longer wheelbase helps, but the CLA Electric’s rear seat still isn’t ideal for the chauffeur-driven. The backrest angle is a bit too upright, under-thigh support is limited, and the low roofline compromises headroom for taller passengers. The knees-up posture, due to the underfloor battery, also affects comfort. Mercedes engineers say the ICE versions will offer better posture with a lower floor. Rear seat comfort is compromised due to a knees-up seating position and upright backrest. You do get a flip-down armrest with cupholders and a slot for your phone (though no wireless charging). A key talking point is the fixed panoramic glass roof. It opens up the cabin and looks stunning, but in India’s harsh summers, the lack of a physical shade raises concerns. Mercedes claims the glass is heat-insulated with a special coating, but only a real-world Indian summer will validate that. Boot space is slightly down on the previous CLA, but the 405 litres on offer is still usable, with a flat floor and good shape – enough for a long weekend’s luggage. For India, though, the lack of a spare wheel is a red flag. A puncture repair kit is standard, but many buyers will opt for a space-saver spare, which will eat into the boot’s capacity. Unlike the EQS EVs, the bonnet opens. Gets a handy 101-litre frunk space. On the plus side, the CLA gets a 101-litre frunk – unlike the sealed bonnets on larger EQS models. It’s perfect for storing charging cables, a small bag, or essentials, freeing up the main boot for bulkier items or that spare tyre. Mercedes-Benz CLA: features and safety   Step inside and the CLA Electric feels like a digital sanctuary, debuting Mercedes’ fourth-generation MBUX infotainment system, built on the new MB.OS software. The CLA 250+ we drove features a 10.25-inch driver display and a large 14-inch central touchscreen. A 14-inch passenger screen is offered on the higher 350+ AWD variant (not coming to India), but we hope Mercedes India specifies the 250+ with the third screen as tech-laden cabins resonate strongly with Indian buyers. New CLA's interior feels like a digital sanctuary. The graphics are razor-sharp, the interface clean and intuitive, and the overall experience is a clear generation leap. Ambient lighting offers 64 colours and 10 brightness levels, while the optional Burmester 3D audio system with Dolby Atmos transforms every drive into a sensory event. AI takes centre stage too – the “Hey Mercedes” voice assistant now draws on ChatGPT and Google Gemini, making it surprisingly conversational and capable of handling nuanced queries. The new MBUX system also significantly enhances navigation. By using Google as its base and layering Mercedes’ own interface, the result is one of the best nav systems we’ve seen – blending the accuracy and functionality of Google Maps with the elegance of MBUX, along with live traffic and smart routing. The 10.1-inch digital cluster also gets a refreshed layout, although with fewer customisation options, in line with customer preferences for classic dials and simplified navigation views. New MBUX system significantly enhances navigation; uses Google as its base. Practicality hasn’t been forgotten. A floating centre console frees up useful storage space, with cupholders and USB-C ports. The previously fiddly steering controls are now tactile and precise, while the electric seat adjust controls respond once again with a satisfying click – small details that matter. Mercedes-Benz CLA: performance and refinement Mercedes-Benz CLA powertrain and specsBattery capacity 85kWh Battery TypeLithium-ionDrive layout RWD/AWDPower 272hp/354hp Torque 335Nm/515NmTransmission 2-speed 0-100kph (claimed)6.7sec/4.9secTop-speed (claimed)210kph Our drive through the scenic Danish countryside highlighted the CLA Electric’s dynamic strength. We tested the CLA 250+ – the rear-wheel-drive version headed to India – with 272hp on tap. The first impression is one of extraordinary refinement. Being electric, there’s no engine noise, but even road and wind noise are impressively muted. Only on coarse surfaces does tyre noise filter in – a testament to the excellent insulation. Refinement is astonishing; even road and wind noise are impressively muted.   Performance, while not overtly aggressive, is delivered with quintessential Mercedes smoothness and progression. The CLA builds power strongly and linearly, ensuring you never feel a shortage of punch. In Sport mode, the acceleration is more assertive, and the synthesised sound, piped through the speakers to mimic an engine note, sounds surprisingly good and adds to the driving engagement without being intrusive. Overtaking on the single-lane Danish roads felt effortless, and the CLA can dart through city traffic with ease, making it equally adept at urban commutes and spirited drives. The 0-100kph sprint in 6.7 seconds and a top speed limited to 210kph are perfectly adequate for real-world driving conditions. Performance is smooth and progressive; overtakes come effortlessly. A new brake-by-wire system has largely banished the artificial and inconsistent pedal feel of previous electrified Mercs. The CLA’s brakes now inspire confidence and feel perfectly normal, offering a consistent and reassuring response. The regen controls are at the gear selector stalk. The push-pull action toggles between freewheeling, medium, one-pedal and adaptive modes. It works fine, but the paddle-based setup was more engaging – mimicking gear shifts and adding involvement as you clicked through the regen levels like gears. Mercedes-Benz CLA: range and efficiency Mercedes-Benz CLA range and chargingVariant 250+ RWD/350 4Matic Range (WLTP-certified)Up to 792km/Up to 771km10-100% charging (11kW AC)9 hours DC Charging capacity Up to 320kW 10-80% DC fast charging 22 minutes The star of the MMA platform is its 800V electrical system, now the gold standard in premium EVs. Beyond numbers, it unlocks real-world advantages: ultra-fast charging that can inject 325km of range into its dense 85kWh NMC battery in just 10 minutes. That said, achieving such speeds requires a 320kW charger, which remains rare in India. Most customers will rely on AC home charging and, on highways, will have to depend on a charging network that largely comprises of slower 30-60kW chargers. The CLA has a WLTP-certified range of up to 792km. Still, it’s not charging speed but range that truly matters in the Indian context. On the WLTP cycle, the electric CLA delivers an astonishing range of up to 792km. Even more impressive was the real-world efficiency of 7.52km/kWh we achieved on our test drive – including several foot-to-the-floor bursts – translating to 734km of actual range and virtually eliminating range anxiety. Mercedes-Benz CLA: ride comfort and handling Out on winding roads, the CLA feels a joy to drive. The rear-wheel-drive setup keeps the steering uncorrupted, and modern Mercs have nailed steering feel. The CLA’s is precise, fluid and perfectly weighted, with well-contained body roll lending it composed agility through quick corners. Out on smooth Danish roads, ride comfort and handling were impressive. Ride comfort is vastly improved over the older CLA, which was hard-edged and brittle. While still on the firm side, the new car has a rounded, mature damping that smoothens out bumps well. The Danish roads may be misleadingly smooth, but this improved ride bodes well for Indian conditions too. Mercedes-Benz CLA: expected price and verdict Initially, the CLA Electric will be imported from Mercedes’ Rastatt plant in Germany, where costs are kept in check thanks to the platform’s dual-powertrain flexibility. CLA Electric stands out with its cutting-edge tech and remarkable efficiency. Mercedes-Benz plans to launch the CLA 250+ in India later this year, likely priced around Rs 60 lakh. For those who prefer to be chauffeur-driven, the back seat might be a weak spot. But for the self-driven, the CLA Electric stands out – stunning design with profound refinement, remarkable efficiency and cutting-edge tech. This isn’t just another EV. It’s a symbol of where electric luxury is headed. And for Indian buyers, it’s an invitation to be a part of that future.

Every curve is sculpted to cut drag, helping the CLA deliver range figures rivalling larger and far more expensive EVs like the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/mercedes-benz/eqs\"\u003eEQS\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e or long-range \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/bmw/ix\"\u003eBMW iX\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe CLA has always been a design-first sedan, and the new electric version retains its distinctive four-door coupe silhouette.
