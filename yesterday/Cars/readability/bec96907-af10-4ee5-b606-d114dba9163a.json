One of these budget cars just proved that you don’t have to spend a lot of money to be safe.Suggested ReadingI Need A Reasonably Sized Car That Can Fit My Large Frame | WCSYB?OffEnglishSuggested ReadingMotor 1 spotted a recent crash test done by Global NCAP, part of a larger UK based charity called the Towards Zero Foundation. Global NCAP does crash testing for vehicles sold in countries that have weak or nonexistent safety regulations for their vehicles. As part of its recent testing, Global NCAP tested a vehicle out of Suzuki’s Indian subsidiary, Maruti Suzuki. Image: Maruti SuzukiThe model tested is called the Suzuki Dzire. Starting at the equivalent of $8,000, buyers can get a 1.2-liter 80 horsepower engine or go the CNG route and make do with just 69 hp 75 pounds-feet of torque. Despite the cheap price and lower power, the Dzire aced Global NCAP crash tests, receiving five stars for adult impact safety and four stars for child impact safety. As Motor 1 pointed out, Maruti Suzuki had every reason to be confident in the Dzire’s ability to pass the tests.Maruti Suzuki was confident its diminutive sedan would ace the crash test because it voluntarily gave Global NCAP cars to destroy. Even the standard Dzire has six airbags, ESP, hill hold assist, and pedestrian protection. Sure, these are features many of us take for granted in 2024 but you can imagine sacrifices have to be made for sub-$10,000 cars. America’s cheapest car, the Nissan Versa, starts at $18,330, more than double the price of a base Dzire. Even in its highest trim level, the Dzire costs only about $12,000.I don’t care what anyone says, six airbags and pedestrian protection at a price point less than $10,000 is impressive. What’s even more impressive is just how much of an improvement this is over the previous generation of the Dzire as Global NCAP detailed.The Dzire assessment for the previous model was part of a Global NCAP initiated test with a rating of two stars for adult occupant protection and two stars for child occupant protection.The outgoing Dzire offers two frontal airbags and ESC as standard. The structure and footwell area were rated as unstable. The side impact test showed weak protection to the dummy chest and the pole test was not performed as this model does not offer side head protection, even as an option.Executive President of the Towards Zero Foundation David Ward says he hopes that Maurit Suzuki will equip every vehicle in its model range with the same level of safety. “We are optimistic that going forward Maruti will seek to achieve this high level of safety performance across their model range. If they do, it will be a vehicle safety game changer for Indian consumers.”",
