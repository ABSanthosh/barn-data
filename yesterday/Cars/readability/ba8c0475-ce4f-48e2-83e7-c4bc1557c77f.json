  "text": "The updated RZ looks familiar, but there are notable changes under the skin, including a 402-hp F-Sport trim 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson Lexus will sell the new RZ in RZ 350e, RZ 500e, and RZ 550e F Sport trims in Europe. It now features simulated gears and synthetic ‘engine’ sounds for added engagement. The brand has yet to announce specifications for the refreshed North American model. Lexus has been developing a steer-by-wire system for several years now, but rather than rushing it to the market, has taken its sweet time to perfect it. It appears that’s exactly what it’s done with the facelifted 2026 Lexus RZ, confirming it will launch with steer-by-wire. The updated model also premieres with simulated gear shifts, that promise to make the driving experience a little more engaging. Read: 2025 Lexus RZ Price Drops $11k, Now Cheaper Than A Toyota bZ4X So far, the Japanese brand has only released European specifications for the 2026 RZ, with details for the North American model still pending.The base model is known as the RZ 350e and features a single electric motor at the front axle with 224 hp (167 kW) and 198 lb-ft (269 Nm) of torque. A 77 kWh battery pack comes standard across the range, with Lexus estimating a driving range of up to 357 miles (575 km) for the RZ 350e. Performance Variants A pair of more performance-focused variants have also been announced. The first is badged the RZ 500e and packs two electric motors that combine to deliver 375 hp (280 kW), propelling it to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.6 seconds. This model has an estimated range of 311 miles (500 km). New to the range for the 2026 model year is the RZ 550e F Sport, which produces 402 hp (300 kW) and accelerates to 100 km/h in just 4.4 seconds. As expected, the increased performance comes at the expense of range, which drops to 280 miles (450 km). Steer-by-Wire Perhaps the biggest headline of the 2026 RZ is that it now comes with a complete steer-by-wire system. We tested a prototype of this system back in 2023, and it’s now ready for prime time. The system is paired with a yoke steering wheel and features variable steering ratios, with no physical connection between the yoke and the front wheels. Simulated Gears Lexus also appears to have taken inspiration from Hyundai and Kia by implementing a synthetic shifting system into the new RZ. Lexus calls this system the Interactive Manual Drive, and it has been paired with simulated engine sounds. According to the brand, this setup “delivers a sportier, more responsive driving feel, offering greater engagement and driving pleasure.” We’ll have to see about that when we get a chance to drive the new RZ. Market-specific pricing details for the 2026 RZ have not been confirmed. The US version should be announced in the not-too-distant future.",
