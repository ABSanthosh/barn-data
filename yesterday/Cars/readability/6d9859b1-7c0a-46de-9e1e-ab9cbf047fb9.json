  "text": "The Q6 and SQ6 Sportback e-trons are coming stateside with hefty prices and impressive performance July 11, 2025 at 20:15 by Michael Gauthier The Audi Q6 and SQ6 Sportback e-trons will arrive at U.S. dealers later this month. The crossover coupe costs $5,800 more than the SUV and comes nicely equipped. The SQ6 has 509 hp and can rocket from 0-60 mph in as little as 4.1 seconds. Audi of America is growing their electric vehicle lineup as the 2025 Q6 Sportback e-tron and SQ6 Sportback e-tron will arrive at dealerships later this month. Both will be available in three different trims with prices starting at $69,600. The entry-level Q6 Sportback Premium costs $5,800 more than the standard model and features a swoopy roofline that is 1.4 inches (37mm) lower than the traditional SUV. The crossover coupe also comes equipped with an S line exterior and 19-inch wheels. Rounding out the highlights are leather seats, a panoramic sunroof, an 11.9-inch digital instrument cluster, and a 14.5-inch infotainment system. More: Audi Q6 And SQ6 Sportback E-Trons Bow With Sleek Styling And Up To 510 HP The $73,400 Premium Plus trim adds an upgraded interior with a heated steering wheel, a Bang \u0026 Olufsen premium audio system, and an LED interior lighting plus package. The model also sports additional driver assistance systems such as adaptive cruise assist and an augmented reality head-up display. The $75,400 Prestige goes even further thanks to acoustic front door glass and a 10.9-inch front passenger display. Buyers will also find an adaptive air suspension and fancier daytime running lights. Power comes from a 100 kWh battery pack that feeds a dual-motor all-wheel drive system producing 422 hp (315 kW / 428 PS). However, this climbs to 456 hp (340 kW / 462 PS) when using Launch Control. The setup enables the Q6 Sportback e-tron to accelerate from 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in 4.9 seconds, before hitting a limited top speed of 130 mph (209 km/h). Customers can also expect up to 319 miles (513 km) of range as well as a battery that can go from 10-80% in as little as 21 minutes when using a 270 kW DC fast charger. The SQ6 Sportback e-tron is similar, but starts at $76,300. It’s distinguished by a slightly more aggressive design with alu-optic accents and 20-inch wheels. Interior changes are more noticeable as the crossover coupe comes equipped with a three-spoke sport steering wheel and leather/Dinamica sport seats. They’re joined by stainless steel pedals, carbon fiber trim, and massaging front seats. Styling aside, the SQ6 has an upgraded dual-motor all-wheel drive system producing 483 hp (360 kW / 490 PS) or 509 hp (380 kW / 516 PS) with Launch Control. Thanks to the extra oomph, the 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) time falls to 4.1 seconds, while the top speed climbs to 143 mph (230 km/h). Unfortunately, the range drops to 283 miles (455 km). On the topic of performance, the crossover has a sport-tuned adaptive air suspension as well as an upgraded front braking system. The latter boasts six-piston calipers as well as larger 14.8-inch (375 mm) discs for added stopping power. 2025 Audi Q6 / SQ6 Sportback E-Tron Pricing",
