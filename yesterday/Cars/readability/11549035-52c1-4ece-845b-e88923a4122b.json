  "description": "This 2003 Lamborghini Murciélago is a left-hand-drive, non-US-market coupe that spent years in Japan before it was brought to Canada in December 2024. It is reported that just 985 first-generation Murciélago coupes were ordered with a gated manual transmission, and this car has 38k kilometers (~24k miles). Finished in Arancio Atlas over Nero Perseus leather with orange stitching, the car is powered by a 6.2-liter V12. Equipment includes LP-style lower bodywork and taillights, an aftermarket exhaust system, a front-axle lift system, 18\" Hermera wheels, an aftermarket carbon-fiber rear wing, air conditioning, and an aftermarket Pioneer stereo with a back-up camera. Recently acquired by the selling dealer, this Murciélago is now offered in Canada at no reserve with a clean British Columbia registration.",

It is reported that just 985 first-generation Murciélago coupes were ordered with a gated manual transmission, and this car has 38k kilometers (~24k miles). Finished in Arancio Atlas over Nero Perseus leather with orange stitching, the car is powered by a 6.2-liter V12. Equipment includes LP-style lower bodywork and taillights, an aftermarket exhaust system, a front-axle lift system, 18″ Hermera wheels, an aftermarket carbon-fiber rear wing, air conditioning, and an aftermarket Pioneer stereo with a back-up camera. Recently acquired by the selling dealer, this Murciélago is now offered in Canada at no reserve with a clean British Columbia registration. The Murciélago was designed by Luc Donckerwolke and was publicly unveiled in 2001 at the Frankfurt Motor Show as the replacement for the Diablo. This example is finished in Arancio Atlas (0058) and features LP-style lower bodywork as well as an aftermarket carbon-fiber fixed rear spoiler, a vented engine cover, a pantograph windshield wiper, xenon headlights, scissor doors, rear fog lights, dual exhaust outlets, and automatically deploying rear air intakes to aid in cooling. The selling dealer states that upgraded LP-style taillights bearing DOT markings are equipped. Black 18″ Hermera alloy wheels are mounted with a mix of Nankang tires measuring 245/35 up front and 335/30 out back. The car is equipped with active dampers and a front-axle lift system. Stopping power is provided by orange-finished calipers fitted over cross-drilled rotors at each corner. The gated shifter is flanked by manually adjustable seats trimmed in Nero Perseus leather with orange stitching, and matching upholstery extends to the dashboard, passenger grab handle, and door panels. Carbon-fiber trim adorns the instrument binnacle and door sill guards, and amenities include inboard shoulder restraints, air conditioning, and an aftermarket Pioneer Carrozzeria stereo with a back-up camera. The axle lift button is worn and wrinkles are visible on the instrument cluster hood leather upholstery and aftermarket carbon-look center console trim. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 360-km/h speedometer and a 9k-rpm tachometer as well as auxiliary gauges. The digital odometer indicates 38k kilometers (~24k miles). The mid-mounted 6.2-liter V12 was factory rated at 572 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque. Carbon-fiber trim adorns the engine bay. Power is sent to all four wheels through a six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip rear differential. An aftermarket exhaust system is installed, and the selling dealer states that the clutch was recently replaced. The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its British Columbia registration, which serves as the ownership document in British Columbia, Canada.
