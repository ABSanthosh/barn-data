  "text": "Published:  May 23rd, 2025 The debate about AI has raged for some time and will surely continue until long after the universe has consumed us all. Stellantis is apparently using the technology to help create a new ad – and we’re not sure how to feel about it.Here’s the skinny: Stellantis wanted to recreate some of the magic it captured back in 2011 with that incredible ‘Imported from Detroit’ ad aired during that year’s Superb Owl. Most gearheads remember the scenes of that commercial, the appearance of Eminem, and the gravelly voiceover provided by a man named Kevin Yon. Here it is, in case you need a primer. Epic, right? Seeking to grab some of the same aura, Stellantis has created an ad tying its wares and company into the celebration of America250. For those unfamiliar, that’s the bipartisan organization charged by Congress to lead the commemoration of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Stellantis wanted the same vibe for this ad, called ‘America Made Us’, which would necessitate more of Yon’s voiceover work. Sadly, the man passed away a few years ago. Here's where AI enters the equation. With the help of that technology, and the apparent permission of Yon’s family plus past recordings of his voice, a voiceover in the style of his voice has been created for this new ad, played alongside images of Americana and any number of Stellantis products both past and present. It’s a good spot, to be sure, but these jaundiced ears tend to think the voiceover doesn’t quite have the same gravitas as the original audio laid down by Yon some 15 years ago. This seems slightly more upbeat and lighter, though that could be entirely appropriate for the subject matter at hand: celebration instead of redemption.Everyone is sure to have an opinion about AI – and this ad just gave gearheads a reason to argue about it, as well.[Images: Stellantis]Become a TTAC insider.
