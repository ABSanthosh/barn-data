  "text": "Are you an old school AM listener or a devotee to streaming music? May 16, 2025 at 20:32 by Michael Gauthier Between streaming services, satellite radio, and terrestrial radio there’s no shortage of options. We’re asking our readers which is their go-to and if they also use other services as well. In-car entertainment has come a long way since the Galvin Manufacturing Corporation introduced its Motorola branded car radio in June of 1930. Since then, AM has given way to FM, while the 8-track would be replaced by the cassette. The latter would eventually be dethroned by the compact disc. Nowadays, even CD players have become a rarity. This shift was brought on decades ago by MP3 players, which eventually gave way to a dizzying array of streaming music services. More: Do You Care About Premium Audio Systems? That brings us to our question of the day, how do you listen to music in your car? I use a variety of different methods as short trips can normally be handled by FM radio or Sirius XM satellite radio. However, I’m probably going to ditch Sirius XM when my subscription ends next month as I’d rather listen to music than some disc jockey, especially if I’ve paying for it. On longer trips, Amazon Music is my go-to as I have a subscription to their Unlimited service. Like any streaming music service, it has positives and negatives, but it seamlessly integrates with my home life as I have several Echo speakers scattered throughout my abode. Of course, there’s no shortage of Amazon Music competitors. Apple Music and Spotify are perhaps the best known, but there’s also Tidal and Pandora, which itself is owned by Sirius XM. So, the big question remains: are you sticking with the nostalgia of old-school AM radio, or have you jumped on the streaming bandwagon?",
