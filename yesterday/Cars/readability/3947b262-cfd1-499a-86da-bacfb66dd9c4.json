  "text": "Faraday continues losing money, but they're banking on an AI-MPV for survival April 2, 2025 at 20:38 by Michael Gauthier Faraday Future has teased the upcoming Super One, ahead of its debut in June. The model sports a massive illuminated grille and is billed as an AI-MPV. Faraday recently posted a $355 million loss, raising questions about their survival. Faraday Future has released a revealing teaser image of their upcoming Super One minivan. It’s slated to go into production later this year and become the first member of the value-focused Faraday X lineup. Scheduled to debut in June, the van has a massive grille that would make Lexus blush. It appears to be slightly recessed and sport a fully enclosed design with illuminated accents. More: Faraday Future Teases New FX 6 Crossover And Super One Minivan Additional details are hard to make out, but we can see slender headlights, a sculpted hood, and pronounced wheel arches. Previous teasers have also revealed a generic minivan shape as well as an expansive greenhouse. Faraday hasn’t said much of substance about the van, but they’ve billed it as an “AI-MPV” that will “meet the dynamic and diverse needs of visionaries and their families.” The model is also slated to deliver “twice the performance at half the price.” The Faraday X lineup is designed to compete in the $20,000 – $80,000 price range and previous reports have suggested the van will come with two rows of leather seats. Second-row passengers take priority and they’ll reportedly be greeted by a small fridge as well as heated and massaging seats with integrated footrests. Little else is known about the van at this point, but the company has previously suggested there could be electric and range-extended powertrains. Faraday has also hinted at taking refundable reservations in the second quarter of this year. However, everything’s still up in the air as Faraday Future recently said the FX family is “contingent on securing appropriate funding and finalizing necessary agreements.” That’s not reassuring when the automaker has a terrible track record and posted a $355.8 (£273.9 / €328.5) million loss last year.",
