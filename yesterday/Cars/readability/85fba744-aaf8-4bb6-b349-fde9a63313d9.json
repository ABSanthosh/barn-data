  "text": "General Motors has issued a factory fix for a problem where third-generation Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon pickups were leaving car washes with dented roofs. This comes after the previously issued service bulletin and will hopefully serve as a permanent remedy.The problem reportedly stems from taking the vehicles through automatic car washes, only to hear a strange popping sound near the end of the cycle. Upon inspection, the roof may appear dented. In some instances, the dent relieves itself and pops back out. But other times it becomes a permanent fixture on what was effectively a brand-new vehicle.This has apparently been an issue for Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon owners since the 2023 model year. There are numerous Reddit posts about the issue, forum postings, and even some YouTube videos where owners express their pain. GM Trucks has been talking about the problem since January of 2024 and there are forum postings that go back further than that. But news of the factory solution is just now starting to reach the public (h/t GM Authority).Needless to say, the roof issue was not an isolated incident and the blame has fallen on the overhead dyers used in automated car washes. Apparently, they can occasionally produce enough force to dent the roof — which explains why the issue was only occurring on models lacking a sunroof and the associated roof reinforcements.Structurally, the dented vehicles are fine and shouldn’t pose any kind of safety concern. But it’s hard not to throw some much-needed shade at General Motors for using sheet metal that’s so thin that it cannot stand up to strong winds. While GM had previously issued a service bulletin with a fix for customers under warranty, it’s now implementing the solution on new models rolling off the production line. This involves installing five reinforcement patches on the underside of the roof to prevent the sheet metal from flexing. These are accompanied by what’s effectively a leaf spring to help strengthen the entire roof, with some “vibration-dampening materials” tossed in for good measure.I’ve long been of the belief that it’s only the people who hand wash their vehicles actually care about them. Despite being less work, automated car washes have a long history of not doing as good a job as you could with a sprayer and a bucket. Making sure the vehicle is not getting dented and scratched is just a bonus. Anecdotes about the automatic car wash are plentiful. But I’ve never heard someone complain to me about finding phantom dents after toweling down their own automobile.It doesn’t excuse the roof defect in the slightest. But it’s something to think about the next time you need to remove grime from your car.As previously mentioned, GM has implemented the above fixes on every Canyon or Colorado pickup manufactured after February 3rd. It’s also willing to repair older vehicles that need roof dents dealt with, including touching up the paint if need be. However, we’re not sure how it will handle vehicles that customers opted to repair themselves before GM announced the fix. You may want to speak with your dealer. Notify them about technical service bulletin 23-NA-209 or Document ID: 6484171 from January 25th, 2024, if they seem confused. [Images: General Motors]Become a TTAC insider.
