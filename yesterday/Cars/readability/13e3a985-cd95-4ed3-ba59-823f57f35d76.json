  "text": "The [DODGE] may be a thesis project from a university student, but it has attracted the attention of a chief designer 2 hours ago by Thanos Pappas The [DODGE] muscle car is a thesis project by university student John Carioti. Ralph Gilles, Stellantis’ Chief Design Officer, shared the concept on Instagram. The EV’s bold design makes it a potential competitor to the Ford Mustang GTD. It’s not every day a Stellantis design chief gives your senior thesis a shoutout on social media, but that’s exactly what happened to John Carioti. While working on his senior project at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, Carioti created a stunning Dodge muscle car that caught the eye of none other than Ralph Gilles, Stellantis’ Chief Design Officer. Gilles, who oversees the styling for brands like Jeep, Ram, Dodge, Chrysler, and Maserati, isn’t exactly a rookie when it comes to spotting standout concepts. The Stellantis exec shared Carioti’s work on Instagram, captioning the post “Once again @ccs_detroit Seniors are Fire! ##.” It’s the kind of exposure that most young designers can only dream of, and it’s safe to assume it can do wonders for Carioti’s career. More: This Is How America’s Teens Imagine Chrysler’s Future The [DODGE] project, which was part of an exhibition for the end of the academic year, looks like a worthy competitor to the Ford Mustang GTD,thanks to its oversized aero enhancements. It takes design cues from the Charger Daytona but features a smaller footprint, a fastback tail, and more aggressive proportions. The front end is a showstopper. A massive chin spoiler leads the way, complemented by full-width LED headlights that flank a narrow pass-through grille. Air is directed through the grille and into a hollow vent on the hood. Given the Fratzog logos, it’s obviously designed for a fully electric powertrain. But hey, if your imagination drifts toward a supercharged Hemi V8 instead, no one’s going to judge you for it. John Carioti / Instagram The profile is just as striking, with muscular fenders, sharp creases on the doors, and large alloy wheels. At the back, the design doesn’t disappoint. The LED bar under the active rear spoiler adds an extra layer of visual drama, and the rear deck does away with the windscreen, following the same trend popularized by brands like Polestar and Avatr. Carioti has also presented a version with a fixed rear wing, which perfectly complements the rear diffuser. More: Forget The C9, This Corvette Concept Reclaims Retro Glory While Dodge is struggling to sell the electric Charger Daytona and is leaning heavily on the upcoming ICE-powered Charger SixPack, Carioti’s design offers a glimpse into what the future of muscle cars could look like. Sure, the public might not be fully ready for electric muscle cars just yet, but that’s no reason to disregard his vision. As with most senior thesis projects, the [DODGE] is purely a design exercise with no plans for production. However, it’s a concept that could easily be adapted to house a Hemi V8, tapping into the more traditional, hardcore muscle car fanbase. Carioti expressed his gratitude to Gilles for the shoutout, and we sincerely hope this marks the beginning of a successful career. With talent like his, it wouldn’t be surprising to see him helping to shape the future of muscle cars (well, yes, and SUVs, it goes with the territory these days…) at a Stellantis design studio.",
