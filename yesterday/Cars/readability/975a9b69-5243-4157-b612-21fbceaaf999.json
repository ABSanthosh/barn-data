  "text": "May 17, 2025 3:00 PM EDTFord’s new Coastal Package pays respect to the Bronco’s heritage The Ford Bronco has received yet another styling package that calls back to the model’s earlier days. The new Coastal Package is available for its 4-door Base, Big Bend, Black Diamond, and Outer Banks trims, as well as the 2-door Bronco Base and Badlands trims. This performance upgrade kit doesn’t touch the Bronco’s powertrain. Instead, it centers around a two-inch lift, Bilstein shocks, and vintage-inspired styling. The styling cues include silver 17-inch wheels, a matching grille and fender flares, a Bimini top featuring a silver Bronco horse, and body graphics with a pastel gradient stripe on the shoulder line that nods to first—and second-generation Bronco models of the 1960s and 1970s. The Coastal Package, which is compatible with 2.3L and 2.7L engines, also includes a pro cal tool for speedometer accuracy with larger tires. Drivers can pair the Coastal Package with auto or manual transmissions, but the upgrade isn’t compatible with the Sasquatch Package. While it may be an ideal fit for summer drives, some might take issue with its price tag. Beauty doesn’t come cheap Owners of a 4-door Bronco Base, Big Bend, Big Bend with Black Diamond package, Outer Banks Series, and 2-door Base will pay $5,400, while a 4-door and 2-door Badlands Bronco driver can get the package for $2,850. The price discrepancy lies in the less-expensive version not featuring the pro cal tool and 2-inch suspension lift. Drivers can order the Coastal Package on the Ford Custom Garage website or add it to their new Bronco order. While the bundle doesn’t include tires, it’s designed around the 33-inch all-terrain tires from the Bronco Badlands, according to Ford. Drivers who purchase the Bronco’s Coastal Package receive a 3-year or 36,000-mile warranty, whichever comes first, when the upgrade is installed by a Ford dealer or ASE/Red Seal certified technician. Final thoughts  There’s no doubt that the Coastal Package’s $5,400 price tag isn’t a small sum to pay, given that it doesn’t include powertrain upgrades, but it may still find an audience with its distinct aesthetics and seasonal timing. One of the 2025 Bronco’s special editions, the Stroppe Edition, boasts unique styling features showcased on stages like the 2025 New York International Auto Show. However, the Stroppe Edition Bronco starts at a hefty $75,635.  Alternatively, drivers who don’t want to fork over the money for a Stroppe Edition or pay $5,400 for a lifted Bronco Coastal Package can select the Bronco Big Bend’s Free Wheeling Appearance Package, which adds red, orange, and yellow stripe side graphics reminiscent of 1970s and 1980s Bronco, F-150, F-100, and Econoline van models. In addition to dynamic graphics, the Free Wheeling Appearance Package contains painted steel wheels and black finishes on the grilles, mirrors, and bumpers, forming an appearance that’s equally fit for the beach. Would you pay that much for the Coastal Package?",
