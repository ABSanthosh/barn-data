  "description": "The 2026 BMW iX3 electric SUV has entered the final stages of testing ahead of its global debut later this year. BMW has released new images of the iX3 prototype undergoing hot weather testing in South Africa. The second-gen iX3, previewed by the Neue Klasse Vision X concept last year, will be the first in BMW's new family of EVs riding on the Gen6 EV platform. Its new EV-only architecture promises to bring significant improvements in range, functionality and cost. New iX3 will be officially revealed by the end of 2025 New Gen6 platform is claimed to improve range by 30 percent Will rival the likes of the Q6 e-tron and the upcoming GLC EV New BMW iX3 prototype: what do the images reveal? Concept design cues toned down The first impression when looking at these prototype images is that a lot of aggressive contouring and character lines have been toned in the production-spec SUV. The body panels are a lot smoother, the bumpers are less aggressive, and the flush door handles are now located on the doors rather than on the window line. Camera-based ORVMs have also made way for regular wing mirrors. BMW iX3 concept vs prototype What has been retained from the concept, however, are the front and rear lighting signatures and the two-part spoiler at the rear. Peeking through the camouflage, one can make out the slashed LED daytime running lamp signature for the headlamps, while the rear gets slim horizontal tail-lamps with an L-shaped signature, which, for a change, aren’t connected. The new iX3 is rumoured to be slightly longer and wider than the outgoing model, which was an EV conversion of the regular CLAR-based X3 SUV. New BMW iX3 platform and powertrain New Gen6 platform uses 800V electrical architecture Specific details about the new Gen6 platform are still under wraps, but BMW has confirmed that it will be equipped with 800V electrical hardware for rapid charging and will accommodate batteries that are 20 percent more energy-dense than the existing one. This is claimed to boost the overall range by as much as 30 percent. BMW has previously said that all Neue Klasse models will return “at least 600km (WLTP cycle) of range,” so it remains to be seen how much the next-gen iX3 actually offers.   The platform will also make use of the new generation of lighter and more efficient electric motors. The iX3 is expected to be offered with single- or dual-motor configurations. The Gen6 platform can accommodate up to four motors, which will likely be reserved for more performance-oriented variants. New BMW iX3 launch details The new iX3 will officially be revealed towards the end of this year, and it will go on sale in international markets in 2026. Following the iX3, there will also be the i3 sedan, which has been previewed by the Vision Neue Klasse concept. The combustion-engined BMW X3 will continue to be sold alongside the new iX3. The fourth generation of the X3 was launched in India earlier this year with petrol and diesel engines. The new iX3 can also be expected to be offered in India in due course.
