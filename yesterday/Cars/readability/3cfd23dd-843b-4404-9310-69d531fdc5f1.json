  "text": "Ever since the dawn of the automobile, it has been a common practice for the class-focused among us to flock to cars with massive proportions and sizeable price tags as a symbol of wealth and status. Think Rolls-Royce, Bentley, or Peerless if you really want to go back.The British Range Rover was a trendsetterFast forward a few decades, and the Land Rover Range Rover was undoubtedly the star of social glitz in the early to mid-2000s. Its third generation, internally known as the L322 and produced from 2001 to 2012, marked the company's decision to move upmarket and as a return, targeted those mall crawler and pavement princess audiences the SUV was later associated with. Third-generation Land Rover Range Rover L322Land RoverThe L322 was powered by a variety of V8s throughout its lifetime backed by either 5-speed, 6-speed, or 8-speed automatic transmissions. It featured full 4x4 capabilities, a must considering its preceding P38 Range Rover model. That latter fact didn't matter to most of the people who actually bought a Range Rover. To them, it was big, luxurious, and stood stories above just about any other car on the road. The social connotation at the time was that if you saw one of these on the road, it was a safe bet that its driver had spine issues from sitting on such a fat wallet.Domestic domination gave the world the Cadillac EscaladeAround this same time, another luxury SUV was making the rounds. The second-generation Cadillac Escalade was popular from the get-go given its manufacturer's long-established association with opulence. Every celebrity at the time was seen driving or riding in an Escalade at some stage in their careers, with rappers often highlighting the model in their songs as a status symbol.Second-generation Cadillac EscaladeCadillacThe second-generation Escalade was around from 2001 to 2006 and was powered by either the 5.3L LM7 Vortec V8 with a peak of 295 hp or the 6.0L LQ9 HO Vortec V8 with 345 hp.Power figures aside, it was likely the liberal use of chrome on the grille, door handles, and even wheels that appealed to the pop culture socialites of the time. With an MSRP of $51,055—equivalent to over $87,000 in 2024 dollars—the Escalade remained beyond the reach of the general populace, solidifying its reputation as a coveted status symbol for the affluent.The Hummer brought the army's off-roaders to city roadsThen came the storied Hummer, first popularized by Arnold Schwarzenegger and his love for its military version, the Humvee. Within a few years, the Hummer was in the hands of rappers, in music videos, and in the driveway of anybody who was, or wanted to be, somebody. Mike Tyson even owned six of the damn things.2006 Hummer H3 FrontHummerThe Hummer H3, the model that brought the company to its peak popularity, still had some proper off-road prowess for those who chose to explore it. Produced from 2005 to 2010, it was powered by a 3.5 liter straight-5 cylinder L52 engine that produced 220 hp and 225 lb-ft of torque. It could be mated to either a five-speed Aisin AR5 manual transmission or a Hydra-Matic 4L60-E four-speed automatic transmission.Given its military pedigree, the Hummer could run on four flat tires and even featured a built-in air compressor to inflate or deflate the tires while moving. 2006 Hummer H3 RearHummerOr you could put big wheels on it and cruise down Rodeo with limo tint. Much like the Range Rover but even more so, its imposing size put your neighbor's Honda Civic to shame. It was a sign of power and masculinity, an image that left an imprint on the youth thanks to the Hummer's inclusion in countless pop culture media.The Mercedes-Benz G-Class keeps the big SUV mania aliveThat brings us to the 2010s and eventually the 2020s. Trucks are the hot new thing and supercars are the flexomaniac's new toy. However, one icon of the luxury SUV's heyday remains strong, with frequent new developments from its manufacturer.2025 Mercedes-Benz AMG G 63Mercedes-BenzI'm of course talking about the Mercedes-Benz G-Class, colloquially known as the G-Wagon.What started as a pedestrian conversion of a military SUV quickly became one of the most sought-after luxury SUVs on the market. The first generation of what we now recognize as the G-Wagon began in 1990 and was produced until 2018 in over 20 different versions. 2025 Mercedes-Benz AMG G 63 InteriorMercedes-BenzThe second generation took over in 2018 as a slightly longer, wider, and taller version of its 28-year-old counterpart. In 2024, the second generation was revised again with all new engines and an electric counterpart, although it is visually very similar. Regardless of whether you want to consider it a third-generation or a facelift, all generations of the G-Wagon carried the same boxy luxury that holds an allure for enthusiasts to this day.The AMG G-Wagon takes Mercedes's luxury SUV into supercar territoryArguably the most coveted versions of the G-Class, regardless of generation, are the AMG models, particularly the $186,100 G 63. Equipped with a twin-turbocharged 4.0L V8, the AMG G 63 combines Mercedes-Benz's hallmark luxury with AMG's signature performance, delivering a fine blend of high-speed capability and plush comfort.2025 Mercedes-Benz AMG G 63 EngineMercedes-BenzConsidering the full package, it's clear why the G-Wagon holds such strong appeal as a status symbol and continues the legacy of its luxury SUV predecessors. Its high price keeps it exclusive, its luxury ensures a premium driving experience, and its impressive speed adds a universally attractive performance edge.Final thoughtsSo what have we learned? Despite the ever-changing automotive horizon, some of us will perpetually be attracted by the biggest, fanciest, most expensive cars on the market. From the Range Rover, to the Escalade, to the Hummer, to the G-Wagon, the appeal of an SUV that stands tall above regular traffic has endured for decades and continues to do so.Arnold Schwarzenegger in front of a Hummer H3Bill Pugliano/Getty ImagesFawn over the AMG V8 all you want, but powertrains will always secede their importance to sheer speed in this territory. That's why I believe that the encroaching threat of electrification holds no power over the allure of a big luxury SUV. If anything, it would only increase it as it would make these land yachts even faster.So long live the towering SUV, with your leather seats, high price tag, and low 0-60 mph figure. You may blind me when I drive my Z, but I can't deny the power you hold.",
