  "text": "Published:  July 8th, 2025 The Porsche Panamera started its third generation in 2024. And this Panamera 4 E-Hybrid just recently arrived on U.S. shores as one of four different hybrid trims. Even though this is the base E-Hybrid, you still get more than 450 HP to play with, a new suspension, and several luxuries inside. The other hybrid trims are the 4S, Turbo, and Turbo S. In fact, this is both the best riding and handling Porsche Panamera yet, courtesy of a standard air-suspension and two-valve adaptive shock absorbers. As a result, going from hybrid, to sport, to sport plus drive modes vastly changes the experience.  All Panamera E-Hybrids are actually plug-in hybrids, with the same 187 horsepower, 331 lb.-ft of torque electric motor built into an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission. It receives energy from a 400-volt, 25.9 kWh battery pack. For the Panamera 4, its ICE companion is a twin-turbocharged, 2.9-liter V-6 that makes 300 horsepower and 309 lb.-ft of torque. And when everything works together, you get a grand total of 463 horsepower and 479 lb.-ft of torque. You also get launch control, which takes full advantage of immediate electric response to catapult this 2.5-ton Stuttgart sedan to 60 mph from rest in just 3.9-seconds. Nothing with a Porsche badge comes cheap and no exceptions here. The base price for a 2025 Porsche Panamera 4 E-Hybrid is $117,495. And my test car included several option to top $130K. But this machine also provides a luxurious ride, 28 miles of electric only driving range, and still top notch fun on your favorite back roads.  Views on Vehicles focuses on new car reviews and news, presented by Robin Warner, a perennial car nut. The reason for the channel's focus becomes crystal clear when you look at Robin's experience. He spent five years of his adult life as an engineer: four years in traction and stability control calibration, and little over a year in vehicle dynamics.
