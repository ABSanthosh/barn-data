  "description": "After Ather debuted Magic Twist and traction control on the 450 Apex, they trickled down to the family-centric Rizta. Now, the company has endowed the 450X with the same, and also peppered it with other small changes. Ather 450X changes for 2025, new features Unlike the Rizta, where the systems are simply on or off, the ones on the 450X are adjustable. Magic Twist has two levels – Low and High – while traction control has three – Rain, Road and Rally – and both can be turned off entirely as well. Both TC and Magic Twist can be switched off entirely. I’ve been using Magic Twist on our Rizta long-termer for a few months now, and I find it to be a useful, intuitive feature on my commutes. I think the adjustability of this feature on the 450X only exemplifies its usefulness. In chock-a-block traffic, I preferred to leave the Magic Twist in Low, which helped reduce the aggressiveness of the regen. It was still effective enough to bring the scooter to a halt without using the brakes.  The Magic Twist has also brought with it an added bonus – a big claimed increased range. For the 2.9kWh 450X variant, Ather claims that TrueRange has gone up from 85km to 105km, and that of the 3.7kWh variant has seen an even larger increment, from 105km to 130km. In the short time frame of this first ride experience, we weren’t able to put these claims to the test, so we’ll reserve our judgement until we can conduct a thorough road test in Mumbai.  Some of the aforementioned range increase is also attributed to the new Zapper N e-tred tyres, co-developed by both MRF and Ather. Ather claims these tyres have lower rolling resistance, thereby helping increase the scooter’s range. The company also claims that there’s a minuscule trade-off in grip, but it’s nothing I felt during my time with the 450X. Visually, these are identical to the earlier MRF Zapper tyres and have the exact same tread pattern; the difference lies purely in how they are constructed. New tyres help increase range, look the same. When it comes to traction control, I found myself leaving the scooter in Rally mode for almost the entirety of my time with it. Rally allows a fair bit of slip on loose surfaces before it reins the scooter in, letting you have fun while keeping you safe. Even when I was riding in Warp mode over some properly rough surfaces, it worked smoothly in the background. The other two modes are more cautious, for those of you who don’t like getting ‘Swayze’ every now and then. The final change is the obvious one: new colours. You’ve got this bold Hyper Sand option as well as a more subtle Stealth Blue option. The former is reserved just for the 450X, while the latter can be optioned even on the 450S.  The discreet belt drive cover looks neat, goes with the 450X's aesthetic. The 450X has always been a sleek, sharp-looking thing, and a small update that Ather has made in the recent past, which may have flown under the radar, is the new belt drive cover. It is ultra-sleek and not bulky like the Rizta’s. Ather 450X handling, issues we faced Beyond that, the 450X is the same as it’s always been. That means it’s still the same energetic, eager, and properly zippy thing that we’ve come to know and love over the past seven years.  Experiencing the 450X at the tight Aruani Grid go-kart track made me remember what a fun machine this is! It is by far one of the sharpest and most fun scooters in the market today, price notwithstanding.   Yes, it is still a little tight for taller folks, and its stiff ride quality is not very pleasant over bad roads – something available in abundance in our country.  The one additional gripe I have with the updated 450X is that locking up the rear wheel has become easier than before, with Magic Twist working hand-in-glove with the sharp rear disc. Riding it on Bombay’s slippery, gravel-ridden concrete roads is one additional concern I foresee.  Ather 450X price, verdict Ather’s software update for the 450X has given it some useful features and additional range, which is always welcome.  The price increase varies from variant to variant, ranging between Rs 2,000 and Rs 6,400. The biggest hike has actually gone to the 450X 2.9, but Ather will now supply the faster 700W charger with this variant, which alone is well worth the extra money. With its updated pricing, the 450X retains its premium position in the market, and if you’re browsing for a fun scooter, this is still one of the most entertaining ones available.  Also see:  2025 Ather 450X video review",
