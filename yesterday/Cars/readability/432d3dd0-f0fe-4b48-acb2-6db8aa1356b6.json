  "text": "With Israel under attack, authorities are reportedly concerned about electric cars parked at ports and other infrastructure June 23, 2025 at 20:21 by Michael Gauthier Israeli officials are reportedly urging companies to prepare for moving EVs out of ports. Authorities are said to be afraid of a massive EV fire being sparked by an Iranian missile. Officials seek to relocate vehicles to open lots, away from the country’s critical infrastructure. The war between Israel and Iran started over a week ago as the country launched a surprise attack on Tehran’s nuclear program as well as military officials and scientists. Iran has reportedly responded with over 400 missiles and hundreds of drones. This weekend, the United States entered the fray and Iran hit back by attacking the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. Despite seeming like a significant escalation, it’s been billed as a measured response as the country reportedly warned the United States ahead of the attack.

In order to prepare for this possibility, the country’s Administration of Shipping and Ports has reportedly “ordered car importers to prepare to evacuate all electric vehicles from Israeli seaports.” The Maritime Executive reports authorities want electric vehicles out of key ports such as Haifa and Ashdod. The belief is that these vehicles would be transported to empty parking lots, away from critical infrastructure. The Port of Haifa says nearly 20 million tons of cargo pass through the port each year, making it the busiest in all of Israel. This makes it an attractive target and authorities are reportedly worried about an Iranian missile landing in the port and hitting electric vehicles. EV fires are notoriously hard to extinguish and this could be a huge problem if row upon row of vehicles went up in flames following a missile strike. While that would be a worst case scenario, it appears to be on the minds of Israeli officials. Of course, it’s hard to say how things will pan out at this point. Photo Google Maps",
