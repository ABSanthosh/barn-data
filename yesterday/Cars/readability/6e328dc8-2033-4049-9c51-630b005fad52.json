  "description": "Skoda has released the first exterior sketches of its facelifted Enyaq and Enyaq coupe EVs, which boast the brand’s new Modern Solid design language. As this design was previewed by the 2022 Skoda Vision 7S concept, the pre-facelift Enyaq, which was revealed in 2020, did not sport this new language. The ‘Enyaq’ was Skoda's first offering in the pure EV space and is one of Europe’s best-selling BEVs in 2024. Enyaq facelift shares design details with smaller Elroq EV Modern Solid design said to extend EV range Pre-facelift Enyaq to be brought to BMGE 2025 Skoda Enyaq facelift design Like newer Skodas such as the Elroq, the Enyaq gets the brand’s new lettermark logo (replacing the winged arrow logo), along with what the Czech brand calls a Tech-Deck face – it features a much thinner grille that the outgoing model, which melds with the DRLs. The headlight units are placed directly below the DRLs, and are framed by air intakes in the bumpers. Visible along the side skirts and rear bumper are silver panels, which will likely be replaced by black plastic in the form of cladding on the production-spec version. As with the outgoing Enyaq, the facelift will also be available in Coupe form. The teaser image shows a silhouette with sharp lines running across the body, along with a black roof. In fact, the overall design of the Enyaq Coupe seems to be a bit more sedan-like than SUV, but this is likely to change for the production model, along with the likes of the massive alloy wheels and the lack of door handles seen in the sketch. Other details visible include dark chrome accents, a sharp tear-off edge and signature C-shaped taillights. Skoda Enyaq India launch plans Skoda has confirmed that the Enyaq facelift, and its coupe-counterpart, will only make its debut later in 2025. While Skoda showcased the previous Enyaq iV at the 2024 Bharat Mobility Global Expo, the Czech brand is likely to bring the same model to next year’s event in January. An India launch of the pre-facelift Enyaq has been on the cards for a while now, and test mules have been spotted here as well. Spy shots had shown that the Enyaq on test was the top-spec 80x variant, which gets a 77kWh (net) battery with up to 513km of WLTP range, up to 125kW DC fast charging support, and a motor on each axle producing a combined 265hp. Skoda claims a 0-100kph time of 6.9 seconds for this version of the e-SUV. More details will be revealed at the BMGE 2025 so stay tuned.
