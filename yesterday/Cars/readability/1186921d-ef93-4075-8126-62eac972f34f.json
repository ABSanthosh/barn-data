  "text": "The immaculate Thunderbird, with just 20 miles on the clock, still has the original window sticker, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Georgia title December 7, 2024 at 19:20 by Brad Anderson This delivery-mileage 2002 Ford Thunderbird presents a rare collectible opportunity. The convertible model has been kept in storage since new for over two decades. Powered by a 3.9-liter V8, it’s now listed for sale on Bring a Trailer, ready for its next owner. Perhaps one of the lowest-mileage Ford Thunderbirds in the US is up for auction on Bring A Trailer, and if you’re feeling nostalgic for the early 2000s, it might be a tempting buy. However, potential bidders should keep in mind that just because a car has barely been driven doesn’t necessarily mean it’s in perfect condition or free from maintenance headaches. Read: Someone Spent $45,000 To Make Ford’s 2003 Thunderbird Concept More Driveable This particular Thunderbird was purchased brand new by the seller’s father-in-law in 2002 and was apparently kept in storage ever since. After his passing in 2023, it was inherited by his widow. According to the seller, the original owner collected numerous Ford Mustangs, F-Series trucks, and, of course, this Thunderbird over the years—many of them brand new and never driven. A Well-Preserved Garage Queen This one, with just 20 miles (32 km) on the clock, essentially has delivery mileage and still boasts its original window sticker, a clean Carfax report, and a pristine Georgia title—a true garage queen by all accounts. But while the paperwork tells one story, the car’s 22-year history serves as a reminder that low mileage can come with its own set of risks, as prolonged inactivity can lead to issues like dried-out seals, deteriorating gaskets, and other components that aren’t designed to sit idle for years. Photos BaT The current seller of the vehicle mentioned in the comments that “the car was started periodically for the first ~15 years, until the owner became ill. It then sat untouched, which is why the fuel system had to be gone through before we listed it for sale.” He also added that the “hardtop has never been removed; hence, the soft top has never been tested.” A Vintage Look with Modern Flair Adorning the car is a bright shade of Torch Red contrasted with chrome 17-inch wheels. The Thunderbird looked a little odd when it first debuted, and it still does to this day, but it certainly stands out from any modern two-door. It’s currently equipped with the original removable hardtop and also has a power-operated black soft top should the next buyer want to get a tan while behind the wheel. However, being that the soft top has never been operated in over two decades, potential buyers will surely want to have it thoroughly inspected before attempting to use it. Given how well-preserved the exterior looks, it’s clear the car has been carefully stored throughout its life. The interior also looks immaculate, and the Midnight Black leather on the power-adjustable seats show almost no signs of wear. Every part is original, including the cruise control, in-dash CD changer, and the AM/FM stereo. Powering Thunderbirds of this era is Ford’s 3.9-liter naturally-aspirated V8 with 252 hp and 267 lb-ft (362 Nm) of torque. The car had its oil and coolant changed in preparation for sale and has also had a new fuel pump fitted. More: Like New 1987 Chevy Camaro IROC-Z28 With 87 Miles Is A Barn Find Dream While low-mileage cars are often more desirable, buying a 22-year-old that was basically never driven comes with its own risks. Engines are designed to be used, and things like gaskets deteriorate over time, particularly in cars left to sit for years. While this Thunderbird could certainly be serviced and driven more frequently by its next buyer, it may continue living out its days as a garage queen.
