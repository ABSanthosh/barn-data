  "text": "Honda only has one EV on sale in the U.S. right now, and it’s built by General Motors. Despite that, the automaker is working with partners in other countries to produce a range of electric models that may never make their way to the States. The latest is the Honda GT, a sleek electric sedan produced by GAC Honda and Dongfeng Honda for the Chinese market. The new cars feature a “low \u0026 wide” silhouette, with the GAC model offering a futuristic experience and the Dongfeng car expressing “an emotional sense of the future that stimulates people who see the vehicle.” The interior has a “racing machine-like cockpit,” and the passenger side has a far-focus display that gives the illusion of viewing a large screen inside the cabin.Honda and its partners in China will use AI to power driver-assistance technologies, including piloting the vehicle along a set route using navigation directions. The automaker said the developments yielded from these efforts will inform future Honda vehicles’ safety equipment and noted that it would expand partnerships with other companies to advance those programs. Since the GT is being developed directly for the Chinese market to start, it’s not likely that the U.S. will see the car on dealers’ lots anytime soon. That said, the technologies and innovations Honda develops in the effort could come to the States, especially as automakers eye more advanced safety and propulsion systems for American vehicles.[Images: Honda]Become a TTAC insider.
