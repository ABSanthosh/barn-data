It was optioned from the factory with Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB), a front-axle lift system, and Exclusive Design taillights and is further equipped with the Chrono package, LED headlights, a speed-activated rear spoiler, rear-axle steering, 20″ and 21″ center-locking wheels, Porsche Communication Management, automatic climate control, a Bose sound system, and cruise control. Performance is provided by a 4.0-liter flat-six that drives the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle with a mechanical limited-slip differential. Purchased by the seller in April 2024, this 992 GT3 Touring has 9k miles and is now offered with the owner's manual, a car cover, a battery maintainer, a clean Carfax report, and an Illinois title.",

Purchased by the seller in April 2024, this 992 GT3 Touring has 9k miles and is now offered with the owner’s manual, a car cover, a battery maintainer, a clean Carfax report, and an Illinois title. The car is finished in paint-to-sample Azzurro Thetys Metallic and was optioned with the GT3 Touring package, which added a revised decklid with a mesh grille as well as a retractable speed-activated rear spoiler in place of the raised wing found on the standard GT3. Additional features include LED headlights, Exclusive Design taillights, a rear fog light, and dual center-exit exhaust outlets. Paint protection film has been applied to the exterior. The 20″ front and 21″ rear GT3 center-lock wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. Stopping power is provided by Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) with cross-drilled and ventilated discs at each corner. The car is equipped with a front-axle lift system and rear-axle steering. The car left the factory with carbon-fiber full bucket seats that were trimmed in black leather with silver stitching that extended to the dashboard and door panels. Under current ownership, the seats have been re-upholstered in Ascot Brown leather, along with the shifter, center armrest, knee pads, and door sills by Exclusive Option, a design studio located in California. A fire extinguisher with a matching leather cover and straps is mounted in the passenger footwell. The GT3 sports steering wheel features a vehicle configuration dial and frames a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline as well as a digital speed readout and dual adjustable TFT screens. A dash-mounted chronograph is included as part of the Chrono package. The digital odometer indicates 9k miles. The 4.0-liter flat-six features direct fuel injection, VarioCam variable valve timing, dry-sump lubrication, and individual throttle bodies. It was rated at 502 horsepower and 346 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle with a mechanical limited-slip differential. The car was optioned with an extended range 23.7-gallon fuel tank. A clutch service was completed in May 2024, and an oil change was performed in May 2025. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage. There is currently a lien on the vehicle, and the seller’s lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the new owner. You are not connected to real-time updates.
