  "text": "Jun 12, 2025 4:44 PM EDTThis M2 Blends Old And New Perfectly Khyzyl Saleem, better known as ‘The Kyza,’ is a sometimes controversial character. He’s designed wacky cars for videogames, some of which occasionally come to life, and he’s part of the TWR Supercat project that gives the old Jaguar XJS a whole new attitude far beyond anything the original creators could have imagined. Some love his work, and others hate it – something he’s fine with, by the way. The same goes for BMW M cars, and the oddly styled G87 M2, in particular. So what happens when a controversial virtual render artist and designer tries to improve one of the most controversial designs of the modern era? Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, something racier than even the new M2 CS, yet also something more elegant. It sounds like a contradiction, and it is to a degree, but just look at what The Kyza has dubbed the M2-KS. It’s hardcore, yet stylish. The BMW 2002 Concept Could Have Made A Great M2 Back in 2016, BMW created the 2002 Hommage Concept for its annual Villa d’Este showcase, which, as its name implies, paid tribute to the brilliant 2002, which arrived in 1971 (though the 02 series of cars with smaller engines had been around since 1966). With his new render, Saleem has maintained most of the underlying structure of the G87, but in replacing the box flares that come standard on the M2, he’s also widened the track. This widening has been applied to the front and rear fascias, too, and that’s how the 2002 influence is injected; new shrouds for the headlights create a sleeker, more aggressive look. The squared intake vents and false rear vents have been swapped for more angular and aggressive pieces, and the sides of the car gain additional vents and intakes. Finally, a wider and larger set of concave 827M wheels fills he arches in the same bronze as current CS-badged Bimmers. The New Look Is Too Extreme For A Production Car, But… The NACA duct on the hood, the vents behind it, the massive rear spoiler, and the excessive vents along the side of the vehicle (and even below the taillights) are too much for BMW to ever embrace, but something must be said for how much better the M2 can look with some softer lines. Someday, the eventual replacement for the G87 will have a cleaner look, with inspiration from the Vision Neue Klasse concept. Until then, all we can do is wait. Unless, of course, The Kyza gets enough interest in this look. After all, his Live To Offend bodykit brand has brought wild interpretations of the E36 to life, as well as the E30. Oops!
