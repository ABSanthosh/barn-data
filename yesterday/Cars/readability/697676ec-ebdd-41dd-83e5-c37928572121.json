  "description": "Aprilia has launched its SR 175 in India at a price of Rs 1.26 lakh. It replaces the earlier SR 160 in the brand’s portfolio. SR 175 gets new RS 457-inspired paint options Gets 14-inch wheels at both ends, shod with 120-section tyres New TFT display with Bluetooth connectivity added Aprilia SR 175 debuts a new engine: It borrows its TFT dash from the RS 457 and Tuono 457 We had earlier reported that the SR 175 has begun reaching dealership floors; however, its price wasn’t disclosed then. It is powered by a newly developed 174.7cc single-cylinder air-cooled engine with a 3-valve setup. According to dealer sources, the bump in displacement comes from a larger bore. This new motor produces 12.92hp at 7,200rpm and 14.14Nm at 6,000rpm – an improvement over the SR 160’s output of 11.27hp and 13.44Nm. Another key update on the SR 175 is the addition of a colour TFT display, which appears similar to the unit seen on the RS 457 and Tuono 457. However, the interface and animations are noticeably different, and dealer sources suggest that the SR 175’s screen offers multiple layout options. Like the 457s, the display features Bluetooth connectivity, allowing smartphone pairing via the Aprilia app for call alerts, notifications and music control. Mechanically, components like the frame, suspension, brakes and tyres appear unchanged from the SR 160. The scooter runs on 14-inch wheels at both ends, fitted with wide 120-section tyres. Braking duties are handled by a front disc with single-channel ABS, paired with a rear drum brake. Visually, the new Aprilia SR 175 is identical to the SR 160. However, its colour options appear to take inspiration from the RS 457. Shades like white with red and purple with red, both closely resembling the RS’s paint schemes.  Priced at Rs 1.26 lakh, this Aprilia competes with the likes of the Yamaha Aerox 155 and Hero Xoom 160.
