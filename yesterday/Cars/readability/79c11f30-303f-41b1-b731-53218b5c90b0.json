  "text": "Published:  November 22nd, 2024 VinFast has officially launched its second model inside the United States, the three-row and all-electric VF9. Following the VF8 into the market, the VF9 arrives with an MSRP far lower than initially claimed and range estimates that should make it fairly competitive. The only problem is that the VF8 was kind of a disaster. Models handed to reviewers were riddled with issues, necessitating a smoother launch for the VF9 if the company has any hope of becoming relevant on our market. The VF8 testers were faulted for boasting a surplus of electronic gremlins. Many vehicles had uncooperative HVAC systems and advanced driving aids that would simply cut out at random. Reviewers also complained about turn signals and vehicle displays that sometimes did not work. The powertrain likewise suffered from lapses in quality control. Some models struggled to go into reverse, with the entire vehicle shuddering. Many drivers were also caught out by the way the parking brake needed to have the accelerator pedal pressed to become disengaged initially and then allowed the car to roll afterwards. Steering feel was nonexistent on the VF8 and the suspension was so poorly set up that loads of people claimed it was making them motion sick. Some even accused the vehicle of being dangerous under hard acceleration, suggesting that the alignment was off and suspension failed to keep the wheel in direct contact with the pavement. The remaining issues pertained to connectivity issues and problems with the battery pack. Needless to say, it went down as one of the worst reviewed cars of the modern era. But VinFast is keen to revise its image and resolve its quality control issues. The VF9 is supposed to be part of this and really needs to be a success to help VinFast prove itself as a viable automaker. But the Vietnamese brand is simultaneously trying to learn how to be a global automotive manufacturer since it's formation in 2017. As previously mentioned, the VF9 is a three-row, all-electric SUV with room for seven. At 201.5 inches in length, it’s positioned on the larger end of the midsize sport utility segment. The VinFast is a little bigger than the Kia Telluride and a little smaller than the Chevrolet Traverse. The 123.0-kWh battery feeds two electric motors (allowing for all-wheel drive) and yields a combined output of 402 horsepower and 457 pound-feet of torque. VinFast said that should be sufficient to launch the vehicle to 62 mph in 6.6 seconds. The Eco trim was certified by the EPA with a maximum range of 330 miles between charges, whereas the Plus is supposed to be capable of running 291 miles between charges. Those with access to a DC fast-charger are supposed to be able to recoup a 10 to 70 percent state of charge within 35 minutes. VF9 cabins are predictably minimal. You get a head-up display and one large, 15.6-inch central screen that handles practically every task not related to steering. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, as are most commonplace driving aids (e.g. traffic-sign recognition, adaptive cruise control, cross-traffic alerts). There’s also a decent number of USB ports for every row. With VinFast slashing the original starting MSRP by $10,000, the Eco trim starts at $71,000. The Plus begins at $75,000 and comes with more standard equipment — including vegan “leather” upholstery, a panoramic glass roof, larger wheels, and upgraded seats. For the driver, this means 12-way power adjustments,ventilation, and massage functions. But the front passenger and second-row occupants also get higher-end places to plant themselves, with the latter likewise getting captain’s chairs. With only a handful of people having received any seat time with the VF9, takeaways are limited. But we’ve heard more than a couple contemporaries gripe about its staggeringly large turning radius and the occasional gaffe stemming from the electronics. However, we’re not willing to commit to any serious judgment until we’ve tested one ourselves. Pre-production vehicles aren’t always dialed in and precious few people have actually driven the VF9. Considering the price and performance of other EVs in this segment, it’s a little hard to see the VinFast VF9 as stealing sales from other brands. But it does come with a 10-year, 125,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty in addition to the 10-year battery warranty with unlimited miles. That’s as good of a warranty as you’re likely to find and may offer some peace of mind to shoppers that are interested in supporting VinFast but are worried about reliability issues.
