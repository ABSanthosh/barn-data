  "description": "The Kia Syros has been crash tested by BNCAP and it has come away with a 5-star safety rating for both adult and child occupant protection. The Syros scored 30.21 out of 32 in adult occupant protection (AOP) and 44.42 out of 49 in child occupant protection (COP). This makes it Kia’s first model to get a 5-star safety rating in a crash test by either BNCAP or GNCAP.   Syros scored 30.21 points out of 32 in AOP It secured 44.42 points out of 49 in COP 5-star rating is applicable for all petrol variants BNCAP tested the top-spec HTX+ petrol-DCT and the mid-spec HTK(O) petrol-MT variants of the Syros, but the ratings are applicable for the entire petrol range of the Syros. Kia Syros safety features Gets 6 airbags, ESC as standard  The tested models came equipped with six airbags three-point seatbelts with reminders for all passengers, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), ISOFIX anchors for rear outboard seats and a passenger-side airbag cut-off switch.  The Syros also complies with ESC regulations and AIS-100 pedestrian protection norms. Kia Syros adult occupant protection 30.21 out of 32 in AOP  The report noted that the protection offered to the driver’s and the passenger’s head and neck region was good, although protection to the driver’s chest and knee area was adequate. The Syros secured 14.21 out of 16.00 in the frontal offset deformable barrier test. In the side movable deformable barrier test, the Syros secured 16.00 out of 16.00, offering good protection overall. In the side pole impact test, it was rated OK. Kia Syros child occupant protection 44.42 out of 49 in COP  The Syros scored 23.42 points out of 24 in dynamic test and 10 points out of 12 in CRS installation. Both the 18-month-old and the 3-year-old child dummies were tested in rearward-facing child seats positioned in the front passenger seat, secured by ISOFIX anchorages and a support leg. Interestingly, while the Sonet is based on Kia’s K2 platform, the Syros is underpinned by the smaller K1 platform that underpins cars like the Hyundai Grand i10 Nios and Exter. The company refers to the Syros’ platform as the reinforced K1 though, given that it has been strengthened with a lot of hot-stamped parts in the body shell. Kia says using the newer K1 platform has enabled it to bring in the latest electrical and electronics architecture as well as upgrade it to perform better in NCAP tests. Kia Syros BNCAP score vs rivals Kylaq has a higher safety score  Among Syros’ rivals, the Tata Nexon, Mahindra XUV 3XO and the Skoda Kylaq have also been crash tested by BNCAP, and all have secured a 5-star rating. Among these, the Kylaq boasts of the highest points, while the Syros comes just after it, followed by the Nexon and XUV 3XO. In Kia’s own stable, the Syros is the highest rated car. The Seltos, Sonet and Carens have been crash tested by GNCAP before, and all three cars have only secured a 3-star rating. Also See: Every car, SUV tested by Bharat NCAP so far",
