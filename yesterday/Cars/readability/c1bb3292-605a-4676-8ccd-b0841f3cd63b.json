ORIGINAL POST: Image: Le Mans, 1954 via Motorsports Images Each January, we set aside time to look back on the previous year and celebrate the best of BaT with our annual awards. This is where you, the members of the BaT community, have a chance to come together around your favorite listings, galleries, videos, stories, and personalities. These awards are a way for us to recognize and reward the people, listings, and stories that impacted us the most in 2024. We have a total of six BaT Awards for 2024 inlcuding the Cognoscenti Award, now in its third year, honoring the contributions of those especially knowledgeable commenters who generously share their wisdom and time with us on a daily basis. Success Story of the Year People’s Choice Listing of the Year Most Valuable Commenter Video of the Year Photo Gallery of the Year The Cognoscenti Award Want to stay connected to the BaT Awards or see past winners? Just click the bell icon on the BaT Awards page, and you’ll get an email each time a new awards post goes live! We wanted to give everyone a bit of time to think about their favorites from the past year. The nomination period will begin today as each category posts, and will close on Sunday. Here is the full schedule for the 2024 BaT Awards: Tuesday, January 7 through Sunday, January 12: Nominations and voting for all six awards Monday, January 13: Finalists announced Monday, January 13 through Wednesday, January 15: Final voting for all six awards Thursday, January 16: Winners and prizes announced Each award will have its own site post, where votes for that category should be cast in the comments. This is the second year that our prizes are underwritten by our partners at Michelin USA—each winner will receive a set of new Michelin or BFGoodrich tires! A few rules to mention: 1) Past winners are not eligible (we’re looking at you, previous Photo Gallery of the Year winners!). 2) Please limit your votes to one per category. (For those of you who forget, we’ll count only your first vote toward each award). 3) Feel free to ask friends and family to participate, but please play fair: don’t spam your mailing list (if you’ve got one) or vote with burner accounts. We will be able to tell. We have ways… We’re looking forward to a great award season this year!",
