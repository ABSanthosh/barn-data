  "description": "It’s an SUV that doesn’t just drive brilliantly ‘for an SUV’, but one that, in true Porsche fashion, drives brilliantly, period. It’s a defining moment for Porsche and a risky one, too. The legendary German sports car maker has taken a proven and successful formula, torn it up and rewritten it – with lithium. Porsche has electrified its bestselling Macan, which, since its debut in 2014, has been the compact performance SUV benchmark. But, with a pair of motors replacing engines, including the much-loved V6, and a heavy battery pack slung underneath the floor, the question is, does the Macan Electric still feel like a proper Porsche? The litmus, er, lithium test is a quick dash to Mahabaleshwar. Porsche Macan Turbo Electric platform and exterior Built on the PPE base It’s important to note that the Macan Electric has nothing in common with its combustion-powered predecessors. Porsche has ditched the ICE platform and moved to the all-new Premium Platform Electric (PPE), which has been co-developed with Audi. Without the constraints of an engine up front, designers had a freer hand in the styling, but yet, from the outside, the Macan Electric is unmistakably a Macan. Signature four-point DRLs look great. The signature four-point LED daytime running lamps remain, but the full-width rear light bar is now slimmer and more pronounced. A key differentiator is the Macan EV’s proportions. The lowered nose, short overhangs, longer wheelbase (up by 86mm), and slightly wider track help improve aerodynamics (down to a slippery 0.25Cd) while giving it a more hunkered-down look. The Taycan-inspired front end and the subtly integrated active aerodynamics (including adaptive air curtains and a deployable rear spoiler) mark it out as a performance SUV even before you step inside. Porsche Macan Turbo Electric interior features Three screen-layout shared with Panamera The interior remains reassuringly familiar and is unmistakably Porsche – superbly built and driver-focused. Material quality is top-notch, with leather, brushed aluminium and soft-touch plastics that deliver a premium ambience. However, the gloss-black surfaces are prone to fingerprints. Infotainment is intuitive, logical and easy to navigate. The driving position remains spot on, thanks to 18-way adjustable front seats, which offer fantastic support and even a massage function – a first for the Macan. Dominating the dashboard is a trio of screens similar to the Panamera: a 12.6-inch digital instrument cluster, a 10.9-inch touchscreen in the centre, and an optional passenger display of the same size – a Rs 1 lakh upgrade. It’s a crisp, clean and well-integrated layout, maintaining the minimalist elegance Porsche is known for. The infotainment system is superb – logically laid out, sharp in resolution and not overrun with an excess of apps. Apple CarPlay is not wireless Porsche has also struck a happy balance between digital screens and physical controls. Unlike many rivals that have gone fully touchscreen, the Macan retains some key physical buttons – most notably for climate control. This ensures that adjusting basic settings remains easy and intuitive. However, there are some surprising omissions. Wireless Apple CarPlay, a feature expected at this price point, is absent and requires a wired connection. This wouldn’t be a major issue if not for the awkwardly placed USB-C ports on the left side of the centre console, which are hidden from view and difficult to access in the right-hand-drive versions. The rear seat isn’t particularly generous despite a longer wheelbase. Also, the rear seats, while benefiting from the Macan Electric’s 86mm longer wheelbase, aren’t particularly generous. The legroom is decent, but the high window line, coupled with the sloping roof, gives the back a slightly claustrophobic feel. Taller passengers will find headroom just adequate, and the knee-up seating position – common in EVs due to battery packaging – is noticeable but not objectionable. The panoramic sunroof helps brighten things up, but the Macan remains more of a driver’s car than a rear-seat-friendly SUV. The small 84-litre frunk is useful for stowing charging cables but not much else. With no engine up front, the Macan Electric offers a small 84-litre frunk – useful for stowing charging cables but not much else. The rear boot is well-shaped and reasonably spacious at 480 litres in the Turbo variant, though lower-spec models offer a more generous 540 litres. Folding the rear seats expands cargo capacity. Overall, the Macan Electric’s cabin stays true to Porsche’s ethos – driver-focused, high-quality and functional – without succumbing entirely to the touch-only trend that plagues many modern EVs. Porsche Macan Turbo Electric performance and ride 0-100kph takes 3.3 seconds Four drive modes on offer. The Macan Electric has debuted in India with the top-of-the-line Turbo, which has a dual-motor, all- wheel-drive setup. Lower variants like the Macan 4 and Macan 4S with rear-wheel drive are yet to be available. Straight-line performance is where the Macan Turbo Electric feels utterly ballistic. With up to 639hp and 1,130Nm of torque, it delivers the kind of acceleration – the claimed 0 to 100kph time is 3.3 seconds – that can humble supercars. Engage Sport+ mode, activate launch control, and the Macan Electric catapults forward as if fired out of a cannon. 260kph top speed While some EVs struggle to sustain their initial surge, the Macan Electric maintains its ferocity well beyond the first few seconds, and given the space, the Turbo can crack 250kph. Porsche’s sophisticated thermal management ensures that performance remains consistent, even after repeated hard acceleration runs. As a result, the performance is always effortless, relentless and completely addictive. Macan EV perfectly balances performance and practicality, making for a great daily driver. And it’s not just heart-stopping acceleration that is the Macan Electric’s forte. Like most high-powered EVs, it blends performance with daily usability. Unlike high-strung ICE-powered performance SUVs that tend to feel jerky and restless in traffic, the Macan Electric is buttery smooth. Thanks to the absence of a traditional gearbox and the instant torque delivery of its electric motors, crawling through traffic is smooth and seamless. Ride is stiff but not uncomfortable However, despite this city-friendly character, the ride remains firmly on the stiffer side. It isn’t uncomfortable, but there’s no escaping the underlying firmness, particularly at low speeds. Comfort- seekers may find this a little intrusive, but Porsche enthusiasts will appreciate the taut setup. Road noise also creeps into the cabin, especially at speed over coarse tarmac, which slightly dampens the otherwise refined experience. On the patchy NH66, which has bumpy concrete surfacing for most parts, it’s deafeningly obvious that Porsche hasn’t been generous with sound insulation, but that’s more to do with saving weight than saving money. The sound I do like is the synthesised ‘engine’ growl that’s electronically induced. It’s neither obtrusive nor over the top – just enough to add a layer of aural engagement without feeling forced. In contrast to some artificial, gimmicky EV soundtracks, Porsche has taken a more subtle approach. 591km claimed range Battery-cooling fan kicks up a dust storm. Range anxiety is often a concern with EVs, but the Macan Turbo Electric has addressed this with a large 100kWh battery, of which 95kWh is useable. After a full day of spirited driving, including high-speed runs and a 4,500-foot elevation climb, it still had 31% charge remaining. Given its claimed 591km range, the battery’s real-world performance is reassuring. Charging speed is where the Macan Electric truly shines. Thanks to its 800-volt system, it can charge at up to 270kW, but the challenge is finding such high-speed chargers in India, where the fast-charging network mainly consists of 30kW to 60kW units. Porsche Macan Turbo Electric handling Sharp and precise steering The steering is sharp and precise, with a level of feedback that most EVs lack. One of the biggest challenges in transitioning to an electric platform is weight, and at nearly 400kg heavier than the Macan GTS, the Macan Electric isn’t exactly light. Yet, you’d never guess it from the way it handles. On the twisty Ambenali Ghat, the Macan Electric is an absolute delight to thread through corners. It’s quick to change direction and delivers an uncanny sense of precision despite its mass. Performance is effortless and completely addictive.  Its near-perfect 48:52 front-to-rear weight distribution and strong rear motor create a rear-engine-like balance, allowing it to rotate beautifully into corners, and with the traction control off, it’s easy to get the tail out for some sideways action. The rear-axle steering (a costly but worthwhile option at Rs 2.70 lakh) further enhances its dynamic prowess, making it feel far smaller and nimbler than its size suggests. Grip levels and the overall body control are outstanding, thanks to a low centre of gravity courtesy of the floor-mounted battery. The all-wheel-drive system ensures unwavering stability, even when pushing hard. The Macan Electric is quick to change direction despite its mass. The steering is one of the best in any EV – sharp, precise and with a level of feedback most electric cars lack. It’s on the heavier side at parking speeds, but that’s a small price to pay for its dynamic edge. Regen braking does not feel aggressive Porsche has also nailed the braking feel. Unlike many EVs with an artificial, grabby ‘regenerative’ braking sensation, the Macan Electric’s brakes feel natural and progressive. There are no paddles to manually adjust regen on the fly – just two settings, ‘on’ and ‘off’, which can be accessed via the touchscreen or assigned to a shortcut key on the steering wheel. When engaged, the regen remains mild and unobtrusive, ensuring smooth and predictable deceleration rather than aggressive one-pedal driving. True to Porsche’s philosophy, the Macan Electric is tuned to feel like a proper driver’s car, recovering energy efficiently without compromising its dynamic character. Porsche Macan Turbo Electric price and verdict Macan Electric isn’t just an electrified version of a traditional SUV but more of a sports car engineered into an SUV body. The Macan Turbo Electric isn’t just another fast electric SUV; it’s a true Porsche. It feels natural, intuitive and engaging in a way that many EVs don’t. It doesn’t come across as an electrified version of a traditional SUV but rather a sports car engineered into an SUV body. Sure, it lacks the mechanical soul of an ICE – the visceral sound of an engine, the ebb and flow of power, and the rhythm of shifting gears – but it makes up for it with instant torque, razor-sharp responses and a level of precision that set it apart. Yes, the rear seats could be more spacious, but none of that matters when you’re behind the wheel. What matters is that this EV delivers the same thrilling experience as its petrol-powered predecessor, and in some ways, even better. Like most Porsches, the Macan Turbo Electric, too, is pricey, at Rs 1.68 crore. But that won’t stop many Porsche aficionados from queuing up for one.

Folding the rear seats expands cargo capacity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, the Macan Electric’s cabin stays true to Porsche’s ethos – driver-focused, high-quality and functional – without succumbing entirely to the touch-only trend that plagues many modern EVs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePorsche Macan Turbo Electric performance and ride\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e0-100kph takes 3.3 seconds\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Porsche_Macan_Electric_Digital_Instrument_Cluster.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003cem\u003eFour drive modes on offer.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Macan Electric has debuted in India with the top-of-the-line Turbo, which has a dual-motor, all- wheel-drive setup.

With up to 639hp and 1,130Nm of torque, it delivers the kind of acceleration – the claimed 0 to 100kph time is 3.3 seconds – that can humble supercars.

Like most high-powered EVs, it blends performance with daily usability. Unlike high-strung ICE-powered performance SUVs that tend to feel jerky and restless in traffic, the Macan Electric is buttery smooth. Thanks to the absence of a traditional gearbox and the instant torque delivery of its electric motors, crawling through traffic is smooth and seamless.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRide is stiff but not uncomfortable\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, despite this city-friendly character, the ride remains firmly on the stiffer side.

Comfort- seekers may find this a little intrusive, but Porsche enthusiasts will appreciate the taut setup.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRoad noise also creeps into the cabin, especially at speed over coarse tarmac, which slightly dampens the otherwise refined experience.

After a full day of spirited driving, including high-speed runs and a 4,500-foot elevation climb, it still had 31% charge remaining. Given its claimed 591km range, the battery’s real-world performance is reassuring. Charging speed is where the Macan Electric truly shines. Thanks to its 800-volt system, it can charge at up to 270kW, but the challenge is finding such high-speed chargers in India, where the fast-charging network mainly consists of 30kW to 60kW units.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePorsche Macan Turbo Electric handling\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSharp and precise steering\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Porsche_Macan_Electric_Interior_Driving.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe steering is sharp and precise, with a level of feedback that most EVs lack.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the biggest challenges in transitioning to an electric platform is weight, and at nearly 400kg heavier than the \u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/porsche/macan/gts-2.9-v6-petrol\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMacan GTS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, the Macan Electric isn’t exactly light.

There are no paddles to manually adjust regen on the fly – just two settings, ‘on’ and ‘off’, which can be accessed via the touchscreen or assigned to a shortcut key on the steering wheel. When engaged, the regen remains mild and unobtrusive, ensuring smooth and predictable deceleration rather than aggressive one-pedal driving. True to Porsche’s philosophy, the Macan Electric is tuned to feel like a proper driver’s car, recovering energy efficiently without compromising its dynamic character.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePorsche Macan Turbo Electric price and verdict\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Porsche_Macan_Electric_Rear_Quarter_Static.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003cem\u003eMacan Electric isn’t just an electrified version of a traditional SUV but more of a sports car engineered into an SUV body.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Macan Turbo Electric isn’t just another fast electric SUV; it’s a true Porsche. It feels natural, intuitive and engaging in a way that many EVs don’t. It doesn’t come across as an electrified version of a traditional SUV but rather a sports car engineered into an SUV body. Sure, it lacks the mechanical soul of an ICE – the visceral sound of an engine, the ebb and flow of power, and the rhythm of shifting gears – but it makes up for it with instant torque, razor-sharp responses and a level of precision that set it apart. Yes, the rear seats could be more spacious, but none of that matters when you’re behind the wheel. What matters is that this EV delivers the same thrilling experience as its petrol-powered predecessor, and in some ways, even better. Like most Porsches, the Macan Turbo Electric, too, is pricey, at Rs 1.68 crore.
