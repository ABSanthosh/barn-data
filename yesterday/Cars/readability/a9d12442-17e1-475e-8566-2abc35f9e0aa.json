  "text": "The BMW M8 is a bittersweet tale of ambition and unrealised potential. The 1980s were an era of excess, where extravagant lifestyles led to equally outrageous cars. The race for the title of ‘world’s fastest car’ pushed the limits of engineering as the supercar market boomed. Porsche’s 959 and Ferrari’s F40 broke the 200mph barrier, while aftermarket beasts like RUF’s CTR Yellowbird and the Callaway Sledgehammer hit 217mph and 255mph, respectively. This need for speed ramped up in the 1990s, with new challengers like Jaguar’s XJ220, Lamborghini’s Diablo, and Bugatti’s EB110 entering the mix. BMW M, already renowned for creating some of the best high-performance road cars, wanted in on the action and set to work. M GmbH’s goal? To transform BMW’s flagship E31 grand tourer into a bonafide supercar, one that would not only rival but beat its competition and solidify BMW’s name at the very top end of the automotive industry. The E31 was an excellent starting point. With a drag coefficient of 0.29, it was more aerodynamic than the Porsche 959, XJ220, and even the McLaren F1. BMW’s M department further refined the design with a bespoke body kit and bumpers, wide box flares, and compact mirrors, not to mention the elimination of pop-up headlights – a change driven by aerodynamics and engine bay packaging. In 1992, BMW launched the 850CSi, the E31’s flagship model, equipped with a 5.6-litre, 380hp S70 V12. But that engine paled in comparison to the M8’s. The S70/2 in the M8 was developed as the ultimate version of BMW’s V12. Though it shared the same basic block design, the M8’s engine featured custom cylinder heads and internals that turned the smooth CSi engine into a quad-cam, dry-sump, 640hp thoroughbred. To put that into perspective, the Bugatti EB110 in SuperSport spec produced 603hp, and the most powerful Diablo GT delivered a mere 575hp. It’s not just power and looks that set the M8 apart from the typical E31. To shed weight, the M engineers used glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) for the doors, boot lid, and that vented headlight-free bonnet. Inside the M8, comfort made way for performance: the plush front seats were replaced by Recaro Pole Positions with unique M-pattern upholstery, and the rear seat was removed altogether. Both driver and passenger were secured by Sabelt harnesses. The eagle-eyed amongst you might notice the M8’s solid B pillars. E31s were all pillar-less coupés, but with 640hp being sent through a 6-speed Getrag manual gearbox and 1990s-era tyres, the decision to reinforce the chassis made perfect sense. Despite the M8 prototype’s overwhelming potential, I’ll never forgive BMW for not putting it into production. And yes, I admit, my disappointment is deeply personal. This is one of those rare moments when I can’t entirely separate my emotions from my commentary because the E31 holds a special place in my heart. Why? My mother has owned her E31 840Ci Sport since I was 10. Seeing that shark-nosed shape for the first time blew my mind. To my young eyes, it was a supercar. As I grew older, I understood that the 8 Series was a grand tourer, but I always saw the potential for something far greater – a car that could have become a true Bavarian icon. The M8 is just one more in a long list of ‘almosts’ that have shadowed BMW for decades – understandable, perhaps, after the financial failures of the 507 and M1. But this one feels different. The M8 could have been incredible, a real-world-beater. The E31 M8 will forever remain a prototype, its full potential a mystery. Still, I firmly believe it would have shown the world that BMW was king.
