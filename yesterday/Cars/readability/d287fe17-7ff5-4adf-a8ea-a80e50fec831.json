Some background here -- I've had regular access to test vehicles since 2009. The first crop of wireless chargers I used didn't work well, at least not with a phone that had a case. Technology has improved, though, and I haven't experienced that issue in years. My iPhone usually charges just fine, though sometimes slower than when plugged in, without me having to remove the case. I did get a new phone and case over the holidays -- I went from having an older iPhone 11 to a 16. The new phone had worked fine with most vehicles, until a few weeks ago, when a test car just, to borrow a British phrase once used by the great autowriter Peter Egan, refused the office. Mr. Teague was testing the same model separately around the same time and had the same issue -- and since we live halfway across the country from one another, it was almost certainly not the same unit.So now I ask of you -- have you had the same issues with your wireless chargers?Go ahead and sound off below.[Image: Roman Vyshnikov/Shutterstock.com]Become a TTAC insider.
