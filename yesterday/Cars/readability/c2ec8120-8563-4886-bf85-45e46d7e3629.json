Now, a spiritual successor has emerged; this time, it’s more grounded in reality. Based on the BMW CE 02, the new one-off project showcases what MINI Design can do when it blends its quirky charm with BMW Motorrad’s electric know-how.Sticking with the same hardware as the CE 02, this MINI-flavored concept amps the fun factor with bold design touches and extra personality. While it’s still just a concept for now, a limited-run special edition with MINI branding aimed at style-conscious urban riders wouldn’t be far-fetched. That said, it’s just wishful thinking at this point.As some of you will recall, the BMW doesn’t officially call the CE 02 a scooter or a motorcycle. Instead, it’s an “eParkourer.” With the base model available to 15-year-olds, it potentially gets future drivers interested in the MINI lifestyle before they even pass their driving test. Mind you, this version is limited to 5 horsepower and a top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h). The uncorked model has 15 hp and tops out at 59 mph (95 km/h).Should MINI launch its own version, we don’t see a reason why it should cost more than the BMW. Prices in Germany start at €8,500. In the United States, the math begins at a more reasonable $7,599. But for now, MINI’s take on the CE 02 is strictly a one-of-a-kind project.It’s part of the “Vibrant Transitions” design installation, which focuses on customization for Milan Design Week. For the same event, BMW built an X3 M50 in Frozen Tanzanite Blue, a matte color from the Individual catalog. The exhibit runs through April 13 at the Palazzo Borromeo d’Adda, an 18th-century palazzo in Milan. MINI has also brought a car by showcasing the electric Cooper S with special body graphics to compliment the CE 02.Source: BMW Italy",
