  "description": "The inaugural quarter of 2025 brought forth a bevy of notable car launches, like the Kia Syros, Hyundai Creta Electric, Mahindra BE 6, and many more. As we head into the second quarter of the year, April looks to keep the momentum going with several new launches. Volkswagen Tiguan R Line Launch date: April 14, 2025 The Tiguan R Line is slated to arrive next month as Volkswagen’s most expensive SUV offering in India. Compared to the previous-gen Tiguan that’s currently on sale here, the new SUV is 30mm longer and features overhauled styling, including redesigned headlights, sportier front and rear bumpers, 19-inch alloy wheels, R Line side panels, full-width LED front and rear light strips, and a rear spoiler. Inside, the Tiguan R Line comes equipped with creature comforts like a 10.3-inch all-digital instrument cluster, sports seats, tri-zone ambient lighting with 30 colours, and a 12.9-inch infotainment touchscreen running Volkswagen’s latest MIB4 software with over-the-air update functionality. The India-spec Tiguan R Line will be powered by a 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine that’s good for 204hp and 320Nm. Power is sent to all four wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and Volkswagen claims a 0-100kph time of 7.1 seconds and a 229kph top speed. Since the Tiguan R Line will be sold in India as a CBU, expect pricing to be in the ballpark of Rs 50 lakh. MG Cyberster Launch date: April 2025 MG’s first all-electric sports car - the Cyberster - is set to go on sale in India next month and will be available exclusively through MG Select premium showrooms. Design-wise, the Cyberster prominently features an upward-swooping fascia intended to mimic a smile, a long bonnet, 20-inch wheels as standard, arrow-shaped tail-lamps connected by an LED strip, and of course, scissor doors. Coming to the interior, the Cyberster has a 10.25-inch all-digital instrument cluster, two 7-inch screens, and another 7-inch touchscreen on the center console. Adaptive cruise control, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a 360-degree camera, and an ADAS suite with blind-spot monitoring, lane-keep assist, and collision warning are also on offer. So far, MG has showcased only the Cyberster’s top-spec 77kWh all-wheel drive variant in India, which gets dual motors producing 510hp and 725Nm, enabling a 0-100kph time of 3.2 seconds and a 580km claimed range. Depending on public response, MG could launch the lower-spec 64kWh rear-wheel drive Cyberster instead, which is good for 310hp, 475Nm, and a 4.9sec 0-100kph time. Kia Carens facelift Launch date: April 2025 Three years after its initial launch in India, the Kia Carens MPV will receive a facelift next month. However, Kia plans to take the Honda Amaze approach with the Carens facelift by selling it alongside the current model. The Carens facelift will also carry a new name, and spy shots of the updated MPV have hinted at a higher bonnet line to give it an SUV-esque stance, as well as Syros-inspired headlamps, vertically-oriented tail-lamps with an LED light bar, and new 16-inch dual-tone alloy wheels. Precise details surrounding the interior remain unknown at the moment, but we expect Kia to update the Carens’ dashboard with new buttons and switchgear, and higher-quality materials. In line with newer Kia models, the facelifted Carens’ feature list could also include Level 2 ADAS and a 360-degree camera. The updated Carens is anticipated to retain the same three powertrains from the current model. Entry-level trims will be powered by a 1.5-litre naturally-aspirated petrol engine developing 115hp and 144Nm, with only a 6-speed manual on offer, whereas higher-end variants will get a 1.5-litre turbo-petrol unit producing 160hp and 253Nm, paired with either a 6-speed iMT or 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. A 1.5-litre turbo-diesel mill will also be available across the range, coupled with either a 6-speed manual or 6-speed torque converter auto. Skoda Kodiaq Launch date: April 2025 The new-gen Kodiaq sports updated styling cues that bring the flagship SUV in line with Skoda’s global models. Up front, the new Kodiaq gets Kushaq-esque headlights, a new grille, and a redesigned bumper. The side profile is smoother than the outgoing Kodiaq, and there are door-mounted wing mirrors and new alloy wheels as well. Over to the rear, the tail-lamps are connected, and chunky cladding can be seen lower down. Inside, the new Kodiaq gets a 13-inch infotainment screen, ambient lighting, an all-digital instrument cluster, and more. The SUV will be powered by the same 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine as the previous Kodiaq. Output stands at 190hp and 320Nm, which is routed to all four wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Tata Curvv Dark Edition Launch date: April 2025 Following in the footsteps of the Nexon, Harrier, and Safari, the Tata Curvv will soon receive the Dark Edition treatment. Only available in the top-spec Accomplished trim, the Curvv Dark Edition will be a purely cosmetic change, with the coupe SUV sporting an all-black colour scheme throughout its interior and exterior. No changes are expected under the hood, with the Curvv Dark Edition set to offer the same 1.2-litre turbo-petrol (125hp, 225Nm) and 1.5-litre turbo-diesel (118hp, 260Nm) engines, both of which can be had with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch transmissions. Pricing is expected to land between Rs 16.5 lakh-19.5 lakh (petrol) and Rs 16.8 lakh-19.6 lakh (diesel), with an estimated Rs 40,000 price increase over the standard Curvv variants. Citroen Basalt Dark Edition Launch date: April 2025 The Citroen Basalt will also add a Dark Edition to its variant line-up next month. A recent teaser video from Citroen hints at a new black exterior shade for the Basalt Dark Edition, which will likely join the existing five colour options. Blacked-out front and rear skid plates, bespoke badging, and alloy wheels finished in dark chrome may also be included. The blacked-out treatment is expected to be carried over to the Basalt’s cabin as well. Like other all-black variants, the Basalt Dark Edition will likely be based on the coupe SUV’s range-topping Max trim, which gets a 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine developing 110hp and 205Nm. Transmission options comprise a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed torque converter auto.
