  "text": "After a week of off-roading the Pathfinder Rock Creek, we're back with answers to your questions 2 hours ago by Stephen Rivers The Nissan Pathfinder tries to strike a balance between two worlds, but ends up being a compromise. That’s the conclusion we came to after a week-long test. Before setting off, we asked what you wanted to know about Nissan’s smallest three-row SUV. Today, we’ll answer those questions and provide a bit more context on our experience with the Pathfinder. As a reminder, this Nissan offers a direct-injected V6 that makes up to 295 horsepower and 259 lb-ft of torque. Our Rock Creek trim came standard with all-wheel drive and several drive modes for various terrains. Nissan talks up just how rugged this SUV is, so that’s how we tested it. Now, let’s get to your questions. Should Anything With Three-Row Seating Have The Word “Rock” In Its Name? DB rightly points out that shorter wheelbases often make for better off-roaders. They typically have better breakover angles, can maneuver tight twisty trails more easily, and are harder to high-center. In the Pathfinder, I don’t think the extra row is the biggest off-roading concern; that would probably be its ground clearance more than anything else. Review: 2025 Nissan Pathfinder Rock Creek Is A 3-Row SUV That Falls Between Two Stools Longer wheelbases can be good off-road, too. In fact, for desert running, Baja-style driving, and instances where one is concerned about tipping forward or backward, longer vehicles can be better than short ones. In fact, it’s on such trails that the Pathfinder Rock Creek felt most at home during our testing. How Did The Undersides Fare? Mr. Paul asked this and added, “or were you afraid to test it like it needed to be, considering what Nissan thinks it is lol.” It’s worth noting that no matter the vehicle, nobody, not us journalists, and certainly not the automaker, wants it to break. So, regardless of the car, we try to be thoughtful about how we use it during testing. Given that, we were considerate about where we took the Pathfinder. For example, we didn’t tackle the super-deep ruts and washed-out off-road trails we tested the Land Rover Defender on. Instead, we took it over three main off-road types: rocky trails with lots of elevation, muddy fields, and gravel/sandy higher-speed trails. The underside managed all of this without issue, though we’d still love to see Nissan add some cladding to protect vital components. Then we wouldn’t have to get out and double-check it so much. Why Pick This Over Literally Anything Else In Its Class? This is the kind of question everyone should ask about a vehicle before they buy it. JT brought up this point, and we think there’s a clear answer. Compared to some, it offers better value. For instance, it costs less than the Subaru Ascent and Volkswagen Atlas while offering more power and better towing capacity. Nissan also offers complimentary maintenance that some other brands don’t. In addition, the reality is that most people who buy big, burly off-road SUVs don’t really use them that way – they just like the way they look and their practicality. Why not spend a little less and get something that’ll do what most people need while being better to drive on the road, where it’s going to be either way? That said, we made no bones about it in our full review: the bottom line is the 2025 Panthfinder isn’t the most compelling SUV in its segment. In fact, it doesn’t even come close… Photos Steven Rivers / Carscoops",

Instead, we took it over three main off-road types: rocky trails with lots of elevation, muddy fields, and gravel/sandy higher-speed trails. The underside managed all of this without issue, though we’d still love to see Nissan add some cladding to protect vital components. Then we wouldn’t have to get out and double-check it so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Pick This Over Literally Anything Else In Its Class?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n                            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/themes/carscoops/assets/images/icons/arrow.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/themes/carscoops/assets/images/icons/arrow.png\" data-type=\"inarticle-image\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/themes/carscoops/assets/images/icons/arrow.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/themes/carscoops/assets/images/icons/arrow.png\" data-type=\"inarticle-image\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n                     \n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the kind of question everyone should ask about a vehicle before they buy it. JT brought up this point, and we think there’s a clear answer. Compared to some, it offers better value. For instance, it costs less than the \u003ca href=\"https://www.carscoops.com/tag/subaru/\"\u003eSubaru\u003c/a\u003e Ascent and \u003ca href=\"https://www.carscoops.com/tag/vw/\"\u003eVolkswagen\u003c/a\u003e Atlas while offering more power and better towing capacity. Nissan also offers complimentary maintenance that some other brands don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, the reality is that most people who buy big, burly off-road SUVs don’t really use them that way – they just like the way they look and their practicality. Why not spend a little less and get something that’ll do what most people need while being better to drive on the road, where it’s going to be either way? \u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, we made no bones about it in our full review: the bottom line is the 2025 Panthfinder isn’t the most compelling SUV in its segment. In fact, it doesn’t even come close…\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n                            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/themes/carscoops/assets/images/icons/arrow.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/themes/carscoops/assets/images/icons/arrow.png\" data-type=\"inarticle-image\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/themes/carscoops/assets/images/icons/arrow.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/themes/carscoops/assets/images/icons/arrow.png\" data-type=\"inarticle-image\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n                     \n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003ePhotos Steven Rivers / Carscoops\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n                        \n                    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
