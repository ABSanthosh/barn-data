  "description": "Mahindra has launched the XEV 9e all-electric coupe-SUV with introductory prices starting at Rs 21.90 lakh (ex-showroom) for the entry-level Pack One variant. The brand will reveal the complete price list in the latter half of January, just before the electric coupe-SUV shows up in showrooms. Do note that this price tag does not include the cost of the charger. The XEV 9e is the larger and more expensive of the two all-new born-electric SUVs launched by Mahindra today – the BE 6e priced from Rs 18.90 lakh being the other. Deliveries are said to begin in February or March 2025. XEV 9e gets 19-inch alloys (20-inch optional), 665-litre boot and 150-litre frunk  Feature highlights include three 12.3-inch screens, 16-speaker sound system XEV 9e with 79kWh battery has an MIDC range of 655km Mahindra XEV 9e dimensions and styling  The XEV 9e measures 4,790mm in length, 1,905mm in width, and 1,690mm in height. This makes it longer than the 4,695mm-long XUV700, and its wheelbase, at 2,775mm, is also more than the latter’s 2,750mm. Mahindra claims a ground clearance of 207mm and a 10-metre turning diameter.  The XEV 9e's grille area is blanked-out, atop which is an LED light bar that runs the width of the car and connects the techy-looking headlight clusters. The liberal use of piano black on the exterior is meant to give it a premium feel. It also gets flush door handles, a muscular shoulder line, and specially designed aero-optimised 19-inch alloy wheels for added range – 20-inch alloys are optional extras. At the rear, it gets slim, connected LED tail-lights placed right below the boot spoiler. The unique 'infinity Mahindra' illuminated logo will be seen on future XUV models. Mahindra XEV 9e interior highlights The 5-seater XEV 9e gets a unique three-screen setup with each screen measure 12.3-inch units. They are 1920x720 in resolution and run Mahindra’s Adrenox software. The EV also comes with a two-spoke flat-bottom steering wheel with an illuminated logo. Apart from this, the XEV 9e seems to carry over some switchgear from the XUV700, such as the HVAC and the centre console controls. It also gets an electronic parking brake, drive modes and brake-by-wire tech. The XEV 9e gets a 665-litre boot and a 150-litre frunk. The top-spec version of the e-SUV also features a panoramic sunroof, a 16-speaker Harman Kardon system with Dolby Atmos, an HUD, safety features such as 7 airbags, a Level 2 ADAS suite, a 360-degree camera and blind spot monitoring. The XEV also features park assist that can park the car for you. However, Mahindra has revealed that the entry-level variant, called the Pack One, will get 6 airbags, a reverse camera, an electronic parking brake and a tyre pressure monitor. Feature highlights will include the three-screen setup, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, connected car tech, 4 speakers and 2 tweeters, push button start, auto headlights and wipers, automatic climate control with rear AC vents, height adjust for the driver's seat and seat belt, tilt and telescopic steering adjust, Type C charging ports and 60:40 split-folding rear seats. Mahindra XEV 9e battery and charging details Just like the BE 6e, the XEV 9e is also underpinned by Mahindra’s scalable and modular born-EV INGLO platform. Both also share the 59kWh and 79kWh LFP (Lithium-iron phosphate) batteries and get lifetime warranty on their battery packs. Mahindra claims that the batteries can be topped up from 20 to 80 percent in just 20 minutes using a 175kW DC fast charger. On the MIDC cycle, the XEV 9e with the larger 79kWh unit is said to go 656km on a single charge, while on the European WTLP cycle, Mahindra says the coupe-SUV goes 533km. In fact, the company says that in their real-world tests, the XEV 9e delivered over 500km. Mahindra XEV 9e powertrain details The XEV 9e comes with Mahindra’s ‘compact three-in-one powertrain’ that consists of a motor, an inverter and the transmission. A 286hp and 380Nm motor drives the rear wheels when powered by the larger 79kWh battery, with Mahindra claiming a 0-100kph time of 6.7 seconds. The 59kWh unit comes with a 231hp motor. Mahindra claims that the front and rear disc setup, along with the brake by wire system, helps the XEV 9e brake from 100kph to a standstill in 40m. Also see: Mahindra XEV 9e image gallery",
