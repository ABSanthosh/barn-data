  "text": "Michigan man agreed to buy a $300k Dawn convertible from Florida but the convertible never arrived 1 hour ago by Chris Chilton A Michigan man says car thieves re-routed the delivery of his convertible Rolls Royce. The $300k drop-top Dawn was supposed to be delivered from Florida but went missing. Scammers are changing destination addresses with transport companies to get cars. When you’re buying a really special car in a country as big as the US, there’s a good chance you’re going to need it transported to you from hundred, if not thousands of miles away. But car thieves are increasingly using that transport window as the perfect opportunity to steal exotic cars. One man who claims to be the latest victim of this trend is Michigan-based Nader Eldamouni, who together with his business partner decided to buy a $300,000 Rolls Royce Dawn convertible. The small hitch was that the grey over orange cabrio was located in South Florida so would need to be trucked 1,300 miles (2,090 km) to his house near Detroit. No sweat, he presumed. Expensive cars are transported across the US every day. Related: Thief Steals Maybach And Rolls-Royce After Duping Dealer’s Transport Company But the Roller never rolled up at his door. Eldamouni, who already appears to own a Lambo, Rolls Royce Phantom and Mercedes G-Class told WSVN 7News Miami he believes thieves stole the car after it was picked up for transport on January 17. Eldamouni contacted 7News after seeing a report on the channel about a similar case, one involving a Ferrari that was supposed to be shipped from New York to the buyer’s home in Houston, but ended up in Miami. Last summer we wrote about how a criminal in Florida hacked into the computer system of delivery company, Dealer’s Choice Auto Transport, allowing him to view delivery schedules and driver contact information. Crucially, he was also able to change the destination addresses of multiple luxury cars including a 2024 Mercedes GLS600 Maybach worth around $200,000 and a $400,000 Rolls Royce Cullinan SUV.
