  "text": "Mar 27, 2025 4:00 PM EDTA photography competition for all Calling all aspiring automotive photographers! The Auto Photo Awards, hosted by British photography organization Shutterhub, is back. Since its inception in 2022, the Auto Photo Awards competition has enabled photographers to reach a wider audience, gain motorsport accreditation, get paid commissions, and get published in magazines such as Chicane, Influx, and Revolution. Plenty of chances to win and a star-studded jury Last year's awards reached an audience of 1.8 million people around the world. For the 2025 edition, the five categories for entry are “Cars as Art”, “Motorsport”, “Scenes and Styling”, “Innovation”, and “Auto Portrait.” Over 25 individual awards will be given, including “Winners” and “Highly Commended” in each of the five categories, one winner for each of the Partner Awards, and one winner of the People’s Choice Award selected by the Auto Photo community. The top 100 entries, which will include category winners, highly commended images, and partner award selections, will be featured in the Auto Photo book and showcased in a touring exhibition across the UK. The judge roster for the Auto Photo Awards 2025 is as star-studded as we'd hope, featuring Karen Harvey MBE (Founder and Creative Director, Shutter Hub and Auto Photo), Alessia Glaviano (Head of Global PhotoVogue and Director of the Photo Vogue Festival), Charles Gordon-Lennox, Duke of Richmond (Founder, Goodwood Revival and Festival of Speed), Justina Williams (Team Owner, EXCELR8 Motorsport), Mai Ikuzawa (Team Principle, Team Ikuzawa and Creative Director, Bow Wow International), Charlie Roughton (Co-Founder and Director, The Maze Group), Phil McGovern (Founder and Creative Director, Caffeine \u0026 Machine), and Hugh Chambers (CEO of Motorsport UK). Want to enter? If you want to shoot your shot at becoming an award-winning automotive photographer or learn more about the competition, head to autophotoawards.com and submit your work before September 4, 2025, at 5 p.m. GMT. If you need a few pointers on how to make your shots even better, we interviewed Vijay Sankar, one of last year's Auto Photo Awards winners, to help you out. Final thoughts Like I said in my interview with Vijay, it has never been easier to be an automotive photographer. With so much talent in the space, it can be hard to stand out, which is why grassroots competitions like the Auto Photo Awards are so important. Even if you think that your photos aren't award-worthy, I encourage you to submit them. We tend to be too harsh when judging our own work, even when it's actually a masterpiece. Who knows, you might be the next winner.",
