  "text": "One of just 178 Vipers in Race Yellow from 2002 heads to auction, and it looks like a fantastic example 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson The Race Yellow Viper features an improved 8.2-liter naturally aspirated V10 engine. Upgrades include new pistons, headers, fuel injectors, a high-flow exhaust, and more. Despite its age, this first-gen model has only been driven 7,034 miles since it was new. Nothing screams “great American sports car” quite like the Dodge Viper, and next month, a particularly bold and bright one will be up for auction. Not only has the Viper in question covered only 7,034 miles (11,320 km) and undergone extensive modifications, but it will also be sold without a reserve, offering a special opportunity for buyers to potentially secure a bargain. This Viper is part of the 2002 lineup, marking the final year of the second iteration (1996-2022) of the first generation, codenamed SR-II. It’s one of only 178 units painted in Race Yellow and retains its original chrome wheels. At first glance, it might seem stock, but beneath the surface, this car has been transformed into something much more potent. Read: Someone Paid $180K For This Rare Dodge In 2017, Then Never Drove It For starters, the 8.2-liter naturally-aspirated V10 has been rebuilt with forged pistons and a more aggressive camshaft. The fuel injectors and spark plugs have also been upgraded, and there are now a pair of K\u0026N cold air intakes sitting in a carbon fiber airbox. The shop tasked with upgrading the Viper also added a high-flow exhaust, long tube headers, and a new twin-plate clutch. But the changes aren’t just limited to the engine. The Viper also sports upgraded axles, a beefed-up differential, and new chassis bracing to stiffen things up. Polycarbonate bushings round out the suspension enhancements, making this a well-rounded performance package. Mecum Auctions This Viper has been garaged since new, and Mecum Auctions notes the exterior is in pristine condition, free of any damage. The interior also looks pristine, although it’s not particularly inspiring with black leather and plastic adorning most surfaces. As far as power goes, the standard 2002 Viper produced around 450 horsepower, but with all the modifications, it’s safe to say this one is likely pushing well over 500 horsepower. And just to remind you, this car comes with none of the electronic nanny systems that so many modern cars rely on, like stability control, traction control, or launch control. If you think the Mustang is a handful, you clearly haven’t driven one of these. If you’re ready to test your skills behind the wheel, you can check out the auction listing here. Mecum Auctions",
