  "description": "A year since the global debut of the second-generation Kodiaq SUV, Skoda has unveiled a hot new RS version. In line with the RS badge, the sportier Kodiaq gets an uprated version of the 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine and sharper styling over the regular model.  Kodiaq RS produces 265hp from a 2.0-litre petrol engine Gets adaptive suspension as standard fitment Has a top-speed of 231kph  Skoda Kodiaq RS: powertrain, chassis upgrades The Kodiaq RS uses the same ‘EA888’ turbocharged 2.0-litre four-pot engine that also does duty in the range-topping Volkswagen Tiguan R-Line. It’s mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, and the engine produces 265hp and 400Nm of torque in the Kodiaq RS, sending power to all four wheels. That’s 60hp and 80Nm more than in the regular Kodiaq. Skoda claims the seven-seat family SUV can dispatch the 0-100kph sprint in 6.3 seconds, before hitting a top speed of 231kph. The RS also receives extra stopping power by way of slotted brake discs and more potent two-pot calipers on its front axle. VW’s Dynamic Chassis Control Plus adaptive suspension system is fitted as standard, offering 15 drive settings and active damper adjustment. Skoda Kodiaq RS: exterior and interior updates The Kodiaq RS is distinguished from the regular SUV by more aggressive bumpers with larger grille segments, as well as 20-inch ‘Elias’ alloy wheels with red brake callipers. It also gets a blacked-out treatment for the radiator grille, exterior mirror caps, the upper part of the window frames, and the roof rails. A cool touch is an illuminated grille that’s offered as standard, on the RS. Inside, it gets the larger 13-inch infotainment touchscreen as standard in addition to more thickly bolstered seats. The interior of the vehicle can be had in two trims – RS Suedia (Suede micro fiber and leatherette seats) and RS Suite (leather seats), with the latter also getting a ventilation function. Overall, the interior sports an all-black theme with contrast red stitching. Although there’s no word about Skoda getting the Kodiaq RS to India, it will bring the regular second-generation SUV here sometime by mid-2025. The model is currently on sale in India in its first generation with a petrol engine and is priced at Rs 39.99 lakh, ex-showroom.  Also See: Maruti eVX production version reveal on November 4 Skoda Kodiaq Armoured revealed",
