  "description": "Alongside the latest 390 Adventure, KTM has also launched the lower-spec 390 Adventure X at Rs 2.91 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). This is the more road-biased and budget-friendly option to the full-fat 390 ADV.  Same engine, frame as 390 Adventure Runs on 19/17-inch alloy wheels Two colours offered - orange and white The 390 Adventure X is powered by the same engine and is housed in the same frame as the 390 Adventure. The peak output of 46hp and 39Nm remains unchanged here but the 390 ADV X weighs 1 kilo less, at 182kg and has a slightly lower perch, at 825mm.  While the overall styling is in line with the 390 Adventure, the X runs on 19/17-inch alloy wheels and its electronics suite is much simpler. Its suspension is also non-adjustable, although at 200mm/205mm (F/R), the travel here is the same as its elder sibling.   Having said that, the 2025 ADV X now comes with the same TFT display as the Adventure and the latest 200, 250 and 390 Duke models. Another change over the older bike is that the 2025 ADV X now comes standard with a bidirectional quickshifter.  At Rs 2.91 lakh, the 390 Adventure X is a substantial Rs 77,000 more affordable than the 390 Adventure and it sits squarely in the ballpark of the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 (R 2.85 lakh - Rs 2.98 lakh, ex-showroom, Chennai).  Also See: 2025 KTM 390 Adventure launched at Rs 3.68 lakh",
