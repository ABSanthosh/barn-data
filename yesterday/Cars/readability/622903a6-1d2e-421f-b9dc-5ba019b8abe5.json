Indicating 13k miles, it is powered by a twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter V12 linked with a paddle-shifted five-speed automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential and is finished in Obsidian Black Metallic over black Exclusive leather upholstery.

The car was sold on BaT in February 2025 and was later acquired by the selling dealer. This R230 is now offered in California with an owner’s manual, a car cover, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New Jersey title. Compared to the contemporary SL65, Black Series cars feature widened carbon-fiber bodywork and a fixed carbon-fiber roof. This example is finished in Obsidian Black Metallic (197) and has bi-xenon headlamps with washers and adaptive cornering as well as a speed-sensitive carbon-fiber rear spoiler, a rear diffuser, and polished exhaust outlets. A three-stage paint correction was performed in March 2025, and close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. The 1886 wheels measure 20” up front and 21” out back and are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires. The track is widened by 4.5” at the front and 4.1” at the rear compared to a standard SL65, and the car features an active-roll stabilization system and Electronic Stability Control. Stopping power is provided by silver AMG-branded calipers over slotted and cross-drilled rotors at all four corners. The cabin features power-adjustable multi-contour sport seats trimmed in black Exclusive leather with model-specific contrast stitching along with a color-coordinated dashboard, door panels, and carpeting. Carbon-fiber trim accents the center console and doors, and amenities include dual-zone automatic climate control, COMAND infotainment with navigation, Keyless-Go, and a Harman Kardon LOGIC7 sound system with an in-dash six-disc CD changer. The shift knob denotes the car as one of 175 designated for the US market and was refurbished in preparation for the sale, along with the carbon-fiber-trimmed ashtray assembly. The leather-wrapped multi-function steering wheel fronts paddle shifters, a 220-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 13k miles. The hand-assembled 6.0-liter V12 features enlarged twin turbochargers that are unique to Black Series cars, and it was factory rated at 661 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque. A plaque bearing the name of the engine’s builder is affixed to the engine cover. Power is sent to the rear wheels via an AMG Speedshift five-speed automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
