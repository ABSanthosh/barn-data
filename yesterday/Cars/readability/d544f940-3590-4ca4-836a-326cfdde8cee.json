  "description": "The updated Yezdi Adventure is set to launch on June 4, and it will receive a refreshed front-end design. Yezdi Adventure to get an asymmetrical headlight It will remain mechanically unchanged Yezdi Adventure launch confirmed This update will bring a refreshed headlight design The Yezdi Adventure was slated for a launch this month, but considering the recent geopolitical issues, the brand postponed it. Now, we have received an official communication that the launch date is June 4, 2025.  Classic Legends has shared a teaser image which suggests that the Yezdi Adventure will get a twin headlamp design with an asymmetric theme reminiscent of the previous-generation BMW GS models. This may come as a surprise because less than a year ago, Classic Legends launched a mildly updated version of the Adventure with minor aesthetic tweaks, primarily a metal crash cage around the fuel tank.  However, this more significant design update had always been part of the company’s plan but was postponed last year due to unfinished development. Now, with the update ready, the Yezdi Adventure is expected to receive a refreshed design. Otherwise, the Yezdi Adventure will remain mechanically unchanged and continue to pack a 334cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine producing the same 29.6hp and 29.8Nm. The Yezdi Adventure is currently priced between Rs 2.10 lakh and Rs 2.16 lakh, depending on the colour chosen. Also see:  2024 Yezdi Adventure video review",
