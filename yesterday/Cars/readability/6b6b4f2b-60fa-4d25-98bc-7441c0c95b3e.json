  "description": "The Reise name is quite nascent in the Indian biking community. Initially known for their tyres, particularly off-road-centric ones, the brand later forayed into the motorcycle gear space by retailing products from other manufacturers. Now, Reise has launched their own line, and when they offered to provide us with jackets for review, I was particularly pleased to get my hands on the Reise PineAir jacket. After using it for over three months, here’s what I’ve gathered. The front pockets are waterproof and keep items safe during unexpected showers. At a glance, it’s a smart-looking jacket, no doubt. The beige colour certainly has its own appeal in a world dominated by darker riding gear. It features Velcro adjustments on the arms and back to ensure a snug fit. The front pockets, mind you, are waterproof, and after being caught in a few unexpected showers, I can personally vouch for that claim. The PineAir comes with a comprehensive protection package, by which I mean it features CE Level 2-certified armour for the elbows, shoulders, back and chest. A low-speed fall on a broken concrete road gave me the chance to ‘test’ the elbow armour. I’m happy to report that the armour absorbed all the impact, leaving my hand injury-free, save for a minor bruise from the armour. Could’ve been worse. The jacket material did pick up a few abrasions in the accident, but it was a worthy sacrifice, and the jacket is still perfectly usable.  Frequently touched areas are prone to collecting dirt on this beige colour jacket.  Now, we’re based in Mumbai, and this year, temperatures consistently hovered around the 35-degC mark (felt more like 40 due to the humidity). I must say, at a standstill, the heat does build up significantly; traffic stops made me feel like a potato wrapped in aluminium foil roasting over an open fire. However, once I got moving, the airflow improved considerably. Of course, the Reise PineAir is primarily a touring jacket, and that shows on the highway, where the ventilation works best, something the swarming traffic of Mumbai isn’t quite representative of. On the topic of it being a touring jacket, there is a bit of heft to it, and its 2.2kg weight does become cumbersome during city runs.  Cordura enhances protection along with the CE Level 2-certified armour. Remember that beautiful sand colour I liked so much? Well, over time, I also learned that it’s quite prone to collecting dirt, especially on frequently touched areas like the pockets, wrist cuffs and collar. While a wash does clean it up, it’s something to keep in mind, as it can leave a visible mark without much effort, but fortunately, there is also a stealthy black colour available.   The PineAir offers solid protection, ample storage and stylish looks, and at a price of Rs 10,000, this is a good alternative to other Indian-made jackets at a similar price.
