  "text": "The most powerful version of the new Charger delivers 630 hp but the looks don't quite match the performance December 29, 2024 at 19:10 by Brad Anderson Dodge plans to release multiple Charger variants throughout the car’s expected lifecycle. These renders reimagine what a widebody version of the new Charger could achieve. Two different wheel designs add to the muscle car’s wider and more aggressive stance. The new Dodge Charger may have left muscle car purists shaking their heads and mourning the glory days of roaring V8s. And yes, the introduction of an all-electric powertrain feels like the automotive equivalent of swapping steak for tofu. But, credit where credit is due – Dodge has at least managed to craft a design that feels modern without abandoning the Charger’s heritage. With a few nostalgic nods and some clever retro cues, the new model still looks unmistakably like a Charger. Earlier in the year, Carscoops’ own Thanos Pappas imagined what the new Charger would look like with a dramatic widebody kit, inspired by the previous-generation model. Another talented designer, Kelsonik, has now provided us with another take on a widebody Charger, and with just a few changes, the new model can be made to look sensational. Read: See The Dodge Charger Daytona From Every Angle In Over 200 Photos The arches grafted onto the new muscle car are similar to those from the old Charger Widebody and suit the rest of the car’s lines brilliantly. Some widebody kits look cheap and tacky, ruining the look of a car. That’s not the case here. The bulbous fenders complement the Charger’s wide and aggressive hips, giving it a bold stance on the road. Illustrations Kelsonik/Instagram Adding to the visual drama are a few other thoughtful touches. Kelsonik has equipped the Charger with a subtly larger front splitter for extra flair and showcased two distinct sets of wheels. Both options amplify the car’s aggressive personality without tipping into overdone territory. While some despise the new Charger, it’s worth remembering that we’re only at the start of its lifecycle. Two variants of the electric model will be offered with power ranging from 456 hp to 630 hp. Dodge is also finalizing a pair of ICE versions with the latest 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged inline-six Hurricane engine from Stellantis, already used in several Jeep models. This engine will be offered in 420 hp and 550 hp configurations. If history tells us anything, it’s that Dodge has a habit of one-upping itself. Over the next few years, it’s safe to expect the Dodge Charger lineup to expand with more powerful and more audacious versions. A factory-standard widebody model feels inevitable. If Dodge can channel the same energy brought to these renders, the future of the Charger could be as bold as its legacy.",
