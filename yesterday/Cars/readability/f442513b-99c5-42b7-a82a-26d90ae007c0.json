  "description": "This 2002 Dodge Viper shows 466 miles and is #12 of 360 Final Edition GTS Coupes produced for the model year. It was delivered new to Ronan Chrysler Dodge in Montana, and was acquired by the current owner on BaT in April 2021. Work since then included changing the fluids and replacing the serpentine drive belt along with the rear hatch support struts. The car is finished in Viper Red with dual Stone White Stripes over black leather and is powered by an 8.0-liter V10 linked to a six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Additional equipment includes polished 18\" aluminum-alloy wheels, projector-style headlights, air conditioning, an Alpine CD stereo, and power windows. This Viper GTS is now offered on dealer consignment with a window sticker, manufacturer's literature, receipts for work performed under current ownership, two key fobs, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title.",

It was delivered new to Ronan Chrysler Dodge in Montana, and was acquired by the current owner on BaT in April 2021. Work since then included changing the fluids and replacing the serpentine drive belt along with the rear hatch support struts. The car is finished in Viper Red with dual Stone White Stripes over black leather and is powered by an 8.0-liter V10 linked to a six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Additional equipment includes polished 18″ aluminum-alloy wheels, projector-style headlights, air conditioning, an Alpine CD stereo, and power windows. This Viper GTS is now offered on dealer consignment with a window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, receipts for work performed under current ownership, two key fobs, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title. All Final Edition Viper GTS Coupes were built at the Conner Avenue Assembly Plant in Detroit and finished in Viper Red Clear Coat with painted Stone White Le Mans-style stripes. Details include projector-style headlights, fog lights, a vented hood, an integrated rear spoiler, and dual center-exit exhaust outlets. The rear hatch support struts were replaced under current ownership. Polished 18″ aluminum-alloy wheels are mounted with an older set of Michelin Pilot Sport tires. Braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated discs with ABS, which was introduced on the Viper for the 2001 model year. The bucket seats are upholstered in black leather, which is joined by a color-matching dashboard, full-length center console, door panels, and shift knob. Appointments include dual airbags, an Alpine CD stereo, air conditioning, adjustable pedals, and power-operated windows. A plaque affixed to the gear selector surround indentifies this example as #012 of 360 Final Edition examples built. The leather-wrapped steering wheel features contrasting red stitching and frames white-dial instrumentation consisting of a 200-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline. Auxiliary gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel level, and voltage are mounted atop the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 466 miles, approximately 60 of which have been added under current ownership. The 8.0-liter OHV V10 was factory rated at 450 horsepower and 490 lb-ft of torque. The oil was most recently changed in 2022, at which time the serpentine drive belt was replaced. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Tremec T-56 six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The transmission and differential fluids were changed under current ownership. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Ronan Auto Body Sales \u0026 Service in Montana, and lists factory colors, equipment, options, and a total price of $79,000. Manufacturer’s literature, service records for work performed under current ownership, and two key fobs are included in the sale. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
