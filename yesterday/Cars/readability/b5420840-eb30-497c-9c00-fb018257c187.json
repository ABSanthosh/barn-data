  "description": "The Royal Enfield Bear 650 is a new scrambler based on the company’s venerable 650cc platform. While it is based on the Interceptor 650, the Bear gets some significant changes that give it its own identity. Gets different wheel sizes and longer travel suspension Highest torque among all the 650s The new Royal Enfield Bear 650 uses the same chassis as the Interceptor 650, but with different suspension and wheel sizes. The front and rear wheel setup has moved from 18-inch/18-inch to 19-inch/17-inch, which is more in line with a scrambler motorcycle. The suspension has also been upgraded, with the Bear getting a similar Showa USD fork as the Shotgun, but with different internals, while the rear gets new dual shock-absorbers.  Suspension travel has also increased from 110mm/88mm on the Interceptor to 130mm/115mm. As a result, the seat height has gone up as well, and at 830mm, this is now the tallest of the 650s. The Bear 650 also debuts new MRF Nylorex block pattern tyres by MRF on spoked wheels - there’s no tubeless option here.  The front disc is a similar 320mm unit to that of the Interceptor, but the rear disc has gone up from 240mm to 270mm. The Bear 650 is equipped with dual-channel ABS, which can be deactivated at the rear. The ergonomics have also been revised, with a new wide handlebar and a different foot peg position. The Bear 650 uses the same 648cc parallel twin engine as all of its siblings, but with one big change. Instead of dual exhaust pipes, the bike now runs a two-into one system with a single exhaust on the right side. With this change, torque has gone up from 52Nm to 56.5Nm at the same 5150rpm, while peak power remains similar at 47hp at 7250rpm. While this new exhaust set up would have certainly helped save some weight, the Bear 650 only weighs two kilos less than the Interceptor at 216kg. This is partly down to the new suspension and wheels/tyres, but also because Royal Enfield has braced the chassis in numerous areas to accommodate the light off road riding that the Bear is capable of. Design wise, the Bear 650 differentiates itself with a unique stance from its new wheel sizes, as well as a scrambler-style seat which is kicked up slightly at the rear. The head and tail lamps are both familiar round LED units from existing Royal Enfields, and the Bear 650 also gets new LED indicators. Adding to the scrambler vibe are the competition number boards on the side panels, as well as the raised ground clearance - now 184mm.  The bike also drops the simple dual pod instrument console from the Interceptor 650 in favour of the new circular TFT display from the Guerrilla and Himalayan. This display supports Google Maps and it is controlled by new switchgear. The Royal Enfield Bear 650 will be available in five different colours. Prices as well as our review of the motorcycle will be revealed on 5 November. Also see: Updated Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 spotted with twin front disc brakes",
