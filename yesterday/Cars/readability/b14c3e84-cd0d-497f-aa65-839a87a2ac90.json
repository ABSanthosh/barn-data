  "description": "New Prelude will be based on the Civic, serving as a halo car for Honda's electrified tech Revived sports coupé will be launched in 2026 with new S+ Shift system and hybrid powertrain The new Honda Prelude hybrid coupé will feature a unique simulated gearbox when it is launched in 2026 as part of an effort to ensure it offers driving thrills. The Japanese firm will revive the long-running model after a gap of more than 20 years – and the new version is set to serve as a halo product for its electrified technologies. The new Prelude will be based on the Civic and have a 2.0-litre powertrain that uses Honda's e:HEV hybrid system. The complex set-up of that system effectively prohibits a manual transmission being fitted – so Honda will instead introduce a new S+ Shift system. Honda says the new system will \"simulate the sound and feel of quick automatic gearchanges\". Hans De Jaeger, the firm's Europe senior-vice president, said this will  \"not only deliver exceptional efficiency, but also the fun-to-drive performance for which this model is known\". The firm has not given any technical details about the new S+ Shift system, with a series of new official images featuring a single close-up of the drive mode selector. As a result, it is unknown if the system will simulate only an automatic gearbox – or if it could allow for simulated manual changes using steering wheel paddles or similar. The system is likely to serve in a similar fashion to the one on the electric Hyundai Ionic 5 N. Reports that the new Prelude would sport a simulated transmission emerged earlier this year and project leader Tomoyuki Yamagami added fuel to the rumours when he refused to rule out the idea in an interview with Autocar in October. Speaking then, Yamagami said: \"When you're in charge of developing the Prelude, you understand everyone has a lot of expectations of a coupé.\" Asked at that time about the reports of a manual gearbox, he said: “It’s very hard to answer that. Let me say that I own three cars and two of them have a manual transmission: one is an Accord Type R, the other a 997 [Porsche 911], because I'm a big fan of manuals. “I really love manual vehicles, and I can only say that it would be something I’d like [for the Prelude]. With a manual transmission, it would be a very fun vehicle to be with.” Honda's e:HEV system primarily uses an electric motor to propel the wheels, and while the petrol engine can drive the wheels directly at higher speeds, it serves largely as a generator to charge the battery. This removes the need for traditional gearing. Honda has previously offered a traditional manual gearbox on the Civic and Insight hybrids, although it was connected to an earlier, more conventional hybrid powertrain. Already revealed as a show car, the Prelude was recently spied testing in the German countryside. Although it's covered in a camouflage wrap, it's clear that the styling of the show car will be carried through to production.",
