  "description": "Audi’s family SUV moves onto the PPC platform for its third generation, but fans will recognise the bones Ingolstadt has enjoyed playing around with the letters and numbers that accompany the Q5 badging on the back of an Audi Q5 in the last few years. But perhaps it should brandish just one word underneath the rear lights: success.The Q5 is Audi’s best-seller (taking 17% of the German brand's global sales in 2024) and can be seen across multiple continents, fulfilling the needs of family SUV owners worldwide.This new-generation model sits on the new Premium Platform Combustion (PPC) platform, which it shares with the new Audi A5 and Audi A6 saloons and estates.Unlike those cars, the Q5 isn't offered with a pure combustion engine. It comes with either a 2.0-litre petrol or 2.0-litre diesel engine with a mild-hybrid system. Two plug-in hybrid powertrains are planned for the future too.And there's a 3.0-litre petrol V6-engined sports model called the Audi SQ5, which gets its own separate review.Audi’s renewed investment in these powertrains and this model point to larger electric transition plans for the company, which focus on the slower than anticipated uptake of electric cars.",

  "text": "The interior is very familiar from the other Audi models that sit on the new PPC platform. That means there’s an 11.9in Virtual Cockpit behind the steering wheel and a 14.5in touchscreen in the middle. Spring for the Edition 1 model and you also get the Passenger Display, a secondary touchscreen measuring 10.9in. It can be used to alter the sat-nav (inbuilt or with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto) and a few other things. It allows the front passenger to make some decisions, alleviating the need for the driver to take their eyes off the road. It can also be used to watch videos, invisibly to the driver. The climate controls are on the big central screen. There’s a bar at the bottom that's shown permanently, and it all works quickly, but you will still find yourself prodding and guessing rather than feeling and knowing. There are a few peculiarities to be found. There’s an entire control panel where you would typically find the window switches. The foglight controls can be found there, for instance, so if the driver pulls the door closed using this, instead of the handle, they will very likely turn the foglights on. Material quality is broadly good. Scratchy surfaces are very minimal. But the drive selector for the gearbox is tiny and nicked straight from the Skoda Enyaq. While the gearshift paddles behind the steering wheel are small and made from cheap-feeling plastic. Practicality has improved from the old Q5. The wheelbase is a touch longer, which has freed up a bit of leg space for rear seat passengers. An adult can sit behind an adult driver with ease and the rear seats can be moved lengthways and tilted, aiding flexibility.  Boot space is 520 litres – roughly the same as before – or 515 with the Sportback bodystyle.",
