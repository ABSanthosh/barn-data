It now shows 3,200 kilometers (~2k miles). Finished in black over a two-tone cloth interior, it is powered by a turbocharged 3.8-Liter V6 paired with a four-speed automatic transmission, and it features include 15″ chrome wheels, removable glass roof panels, a rear spoiler, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, a Delco AM/FM/cassette stereo with a graphic equalizer, air conditioning, and cruise control. This Grand National is now offered by the selling dealer in Canada with literature, a clean Carfax report, and Ontario registration. The car is finished in black and features a sculpted hood, removable glass roof panels, an automatic power antenna, a rear window defogger, sport mirrors, and a decklid spoiler. Factory 15″ wheels feature a bright finish with black recesses. Goodyear Eagle GTII tires are mounted at each corner, and they are said to be original to the car. Braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums. The cabin features bucket seats and a rear bench upholstered in Black and Sand Gray cloth, with Turbo 6 embroidery on the front seat headrests. Additional amenities include a power-adjustable driver’s seat, air conditioning, cruise control, power accessories, and a Delco AM/FM/cassette stereo with a graphic equalizer. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a linear 140-km/h speedometer, a digital tachometer, and gauges for boost pressure and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 3,200 kilometers (~2k miles). The turbocharged and intercooled 3.8-liter V6 was factory-rated at 245 horsepower and 355 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission. The Carfax report shows no accidents or damage. The vehicle is being offered on its Ontario registration, which serves as the ownership document in Ontario, Canada. The sale does not include a US title. You are not connected to real-time updates.
