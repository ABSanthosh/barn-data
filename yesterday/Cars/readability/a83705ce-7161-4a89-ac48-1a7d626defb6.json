  "description": "This 1967 Iso Rivolta IR 300 is one of 797 examples built between 1962 and 1970 and is said to have been delivered new in the US. It underwent a multi-year build after 2015 that included the installation of a 6.0-liter L76 V8 and Tremec TR-6060 six-speed manual transmission, a repaint in Grigio Silverstone, and an interior re-trim in Paloma Cork leather upholstery. A Heidts Superide II independent front coilover suspension was installed along with a custom Jaguar-style de Dion rear axle with adjustable shocks, and additional equipment includes an aluminum radiator, power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering, a MagnaFlow muffler, power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes with inboard rear units and a Wilwood billet master cylinder, 15″ Campagnolo alloy wheels with Borrani center-lock hubs, power windows, a VintageAir HVAC system, remote power locks, a B\u0026M shifter, an Alpine stereo, and a wood dash panel. The car was listed on BaT in February 2024 and later purchased by the current owner. This modified IR 300 is now offered on dealer consignment in Scottsdale, Arizona, with factory literature, refurbishment photos and records, and a clean Michigan title.",

It underwent a multi-year build after 2015 that included the installation of a 6.0-liter L76 V8 and Tremec TR-6060 six-speed manual transmission, a repaint in Grigio Silverstone, and an interior re-trim in Paloma Cork leather upholstery. A Heidts Superide II independent front coilover suspension was installed along with a custom Jaguar-style de Dion rear axle with adjustable shocks, and additional equipment includes an aluminum radiator, power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering, a MagnaFlow muffler, power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes with inboard rear units and a Wilwood billet master cylinder, 15″ Campagnolo alloy wheels with Borrani center-lock hubs, power windows, a VintageAir HVAC system, remote power locks, a B\u0026M shifter, an Alpine stereo, and a wood dash panel. The car was listed on BaT in February 2024 and later purchased by the current owner. This modified IR 300 is now offered on dealer consignment in Scottsdale, Arizona, with factory literature, refurbishment photos and records, and a clean Michigan title. The Rivolta was the brainchild of Iso chairman Renzo Rivolta, who tapped Giotto Bizzarrini to engineer the car and Giorgetto Giugiaro at Bertone to style it. This example was previously finished in silver and received replacement floor pans and a transmission tunnel in 2015 from The Hot Rod Service Company of Campbell, California, who also peformed additional underbody modifications for the replacement suspension components. It was then placed on a rotisserie and received additional repairs by Full Circle Restorations of Lockeford before it was repainted in Ferrari-sourced Grigio Silverstone by Gary’s Rods \u0026 Restorations of Watsonville in 2016. The brightwork was rechromed in 2017, and additional equipment includes polished stainless steel bumpers, a hood scoop, a retractable antenna, front and rear fender vents, a driver’s door-mounted mirror, and a locking fuel filler door. The factory Campagnolo 15×6.5″ alloy wheels were refurbished by Valley Wire Wheel Service of Van Nuys, California, and they are mounted with Borrani center-lock hubs and 205/65 Sumitomo HTR A/S P02 tires. A matching spare wheel is stowed in the trunk. The frame was modified to accommodate a Heidts Superide II independent front coilover setup and a custom Jaguar-style de Dion rear axle with adjustable shocks. The car is also equipped with power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering, and stopping power is provided by four-wheel discs with inboard rear units, a Wilwood billet master cylinder, and a Hydratech booster. The cabin was lined with Dynamat insulation before the low-back bucket seats and rear bench were retrimmed in Paloma Cork leather by Finish Line Automotive Interiors of Santa Clara, California, in 2018. Matching leather extends to the door panels and center console, and a contrasting black leather dash cover, tan Alcantara headliner, and black carpets sourced from Daytona Carpeting were also fitted at that time. Additional equipment includes a VintageAir HVAC system, power windows, remote power locks, an Alpine stereo, a wood dash panel, a B\u0026M shifter with a wooden knob, and a rear fold-down armrest. The rear leather speaker covers were reupholstered since the prior BaT auction. The wood-rimmed steering wheel frames Veglia instrumentation that was rebuilt by North Hollywood Speedometer \u0026 Clock in 2017 and includes an Iso Rivolta-branded 180-mph speedometer and 7k-rpm tachometer. The five-digit odometer was reset during the refurbishment, and it currently shows 4k miles, approximately 100 of which were added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown. The 6.0-liter L76 V8 was sourced from a Pontiac G8 and was installed during the build. It features a shallow Holley oil pan, a cold-air intake, a body-color intake manifold, and Iso Rivolta-branded valve covers. An aluminum radiator with dual electric cooling fans was also installed. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Tremec TR-6060 six-speed manual transmission. The exhaust system features a MagnaFlow muffler. Project photos can be seen in the gallery along with a collection of invoices from 2015 to 2019 totaling over $400k. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
