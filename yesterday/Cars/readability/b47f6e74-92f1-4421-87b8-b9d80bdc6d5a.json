Additional equipment includes a TS Performance six-position chip, 16″ aftermarket wheels, manually locking front hubs, a receiver hitch, heated front seats, air conditioning, and a CD stereo. The truck was purchased by the seller in 2014 and now shows 355k miles. This Excursion is offered at no reserve with the owner’s manual and a clean Oklahoma title in the seller’s name. The truck is finished in Toreador Red Metallic and features running boards, a receiver hitch, a split tailgate, and a rear window wiper. The seller states the trailer wire connector and rear license plate lights need to be replaced, and paint imperfections along with dents on the bumpers are noted. An accident is shown on the Carfax report in September 2013. Black 16″ aftermarket wheels are mounted with Michelin Defender LTX M/S tires. The truck has manually locking front hubs, a Hellwig rear sway bar, and four-wheel disc brakes. The seller states the front ball joints, bearings, shocks, and brakes were replaced in November 2017 and the rear bearings, shocks, and brakes were replaced in June 2022. The interior features three rows of seating trimmed in Medium Parchment leather with color-coordinated door panels and carpets. Amenities include heated front seats, a CD stereo, cruise control, and air conditioning. A tear is visible on the second-row bench. The two-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 100-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and supplementary gauges. The six-digit odometer shows 355k miles, approximately 125k of which were added under current ownership. The fuel gauge is not accurate. The 7.3-liter Power Stroke turbodiesel V8 is said to be equipped with a TS Performance six-position chip, a CAC intercooler boot kit, and a Garrett GTP38 high-flow outlet. Service since 2021 reportedly included replacing the batteries, water pump, radiator, and oil cooler seals. The EBPV has been bypassed, according to the seller. Power is routed to the rear wheels via a four-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case.  The Carfax report lists the aforementioned accident.
