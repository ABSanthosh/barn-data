  "text": "Nissan never made a GT-R SUV, but that hasn't stopped a passionate fan from bringing his dream to life 2 hours ago by Thanos Pappas The first-gen Nissan Murano was used as the base for a GT-R-inspired SUV. The bodykit replicates the R35-gen styling, complete with genuine lights. The build, clearly a product of a big Godzilla fan, was spotted in Malaysia. While Nissan may have recently stopped accepting orders for the GT-R R35, the sports car still commands a devoted fanbase across the globe. One particularly enthusiastic fan from Malaysia has taken this passion to new heights, creating a Murano-based GT-R impersonator, blending the aggressive styling of the R35 with the practicality of an SUV. You can call it the Murano GT-R. More: The Nissan Fairlady X Is The Unholy Union Of A New Z And A Murano This unique build is rooted in the first-generation Nissan Murano, though you’d hardly recognize it as such. The sheer number of styling modifications make it clear that this is no simple conversion. From what we can tell from the photos, only the greenhouse and pillars have been carried over from the original Murano—an impressive feat in itself, showcasing just how much effort went into this transformation. R35 Styling, Murano Practicality The front and rear ends have been entirely redesigned, drawing inspiration from the R35’s signature lines. The grille and front bumper intakes resemble those of the second facelift of the GT-R, which debuted in 2016, while the headlights and taillights appear to be sourced from an earlier model. The rear section has been extended to accommodate dual spoilers. However, based on the panel gaps, it seems the tailgate no longer opens, meaning the only way to access the cargo area appears to be from inside the cabin. Photos: K1 Racing / Facebook A Work In Progress The bodykit also includes wider front and rear fenders, though they look a little out of place when paired with the SUV’s lofty ground clearance and thick, wall-like tires. That said, the builder might still have a few tricks up their sleeve, perhaps a fresh set of alloy wheels and a flashy new paint job. After all, the body is still unpainted, and the current rims seem a bit undersized for the wide arches. The unique SUV appeared on the Facebook page of K1 Racing, an exhaust shop based in Bandar Baru Bangi, Malaysia. Videos on the page reveal a custom exhaust system with quad pipes, giving the Murano a sound that’s unmistakably GT-R. Unfortunately, the posts don’t offer any details on the vehicle’s specs, so we’re left in the dark about what’s actually powering this build. More: Student Designed Nissan Concepts For 2033 Include A GT-R SUV For some context, the first-generation Murano made its debut in 2002, sharing its platform with the third-generation Altima and sixth-generation Maxima sedans. Under the hood, it packed a detuned version of the 3.5-liter naturally aspirated V6 engine from the 350Z, delivering 245 horsepower (183 kW / 249 PS). In contrast, the GT-R’s twin-turbo 3.8-liter V6 cranks out anywhere from 473 horsepower (353 kW / 480 PS) to 600 horsepower (447 kW / 608 PS), depending on the model year and variant. Whether or not this build is to your taste, we can’t deny the creativity and skill that went into making it a reality. We’ll be keeping an eye out for photos of the finished model, hoping they pop up on social media soon. Until then, enjoy the sound of this Godzilla-meets-SUV hybrid.",
