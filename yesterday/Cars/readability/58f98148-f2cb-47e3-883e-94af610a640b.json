  "description": "The Kia Syros will debut in India later this week and add to Kia's compact SUV line-up. The Syros (codenamed: AY) is more premium than the Sonet – which has a similar sub-4-metre footprint – and will come with new features. Prices are expected to be announced in January when the compact SUV's showcased at the Bharat Mobility Expo. Kia Syros will have more rear-seat space and features than Sonet Deliveries are expected to begin by late January Syros to get an EV variant at a later stage Kia Syros exterior design Visually, the most distinctive element about the Syros is its tallboy, boxy design that’s intended to open up more room inside. It gets a clamshell bonnet that houses a 2D Kia logo, under which sit vertically stacked LED headlights and Daytime Running Lamps. There’s generous use of black cladding across over the wheel arches and bumpers. The alloy wheel design is also new and could measure up to 17 inches on top variants. Teasers reveal a break in the window line at the B-pillar, which seems inspired by the Skoda Yeti. It also gets a sharp, distinctive kink for the rear quarter glass, flush fitting door handles and L-shaped high-mounted tail-lights. Kia Syros interior and features Kia says the Syros will offer a “lounge-like” experience on the inside, with “futuristic features and an innovative seating layout”. Kia also stated that rear seat space will not only surpass the Sonet's but also the bigger Seltos. Further, it will include reclining rear seats, a feature that's currently exclusive to the Hyundai Venue in this segment. The infotainment system is expected to be a 10.25-inch unit in the top trims, and it will also likely have a full-digital instrument cluster. Teasers have also previewed a new two-spoke steering wheel with buttons to control the infotainment system and terrain modes (Mud, Snow/Wet and Sand), front parking sensors, wireless charger, USB-C ports, panoramic sunroof and an ADAS suite as well. Kia Syros: engines, expected price The Syros will be powered by Kia's familiar 120hp, 172Nm 1.0-litre turbo-petrol and 116hp, 250Nm 1.5-litre diesel engines with their respective manual and automatic gearboxes. However, the naturally aspirated 1.2-litre petrol mill that's offered in entry-level Sonet variants will not be offered in the Syros in keeping with its more premium positioning. Being slotted above the Sonet, whose turbo-petrol variants range between Rs 9.63 lakh and Rs 14.91 lakh (ex-showroom), we expect the Syros to debut at around Rs 10 lakh and max out at over Rs 15 lakh. This may lead to overlapping with some variants of the Seltos. Also See: Maruti Grand Vitara sales cross 2.5 lakh units since launch Tata Nexon EV, Curvv EV purchased this month get free charging",
