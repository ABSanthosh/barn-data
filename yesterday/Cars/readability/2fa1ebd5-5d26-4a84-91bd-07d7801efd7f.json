  "text": "Power comes courtesy of a 460 cubic-inch V8 and a three-speed automatic transmission 2 hours ago by Brad Anderson This 1967 Mustang Eleanor convertible has only covered 1,800 miles since its 2011 conversion. Inside, the Mustang features original layout with modern touches like a RetroSound head unit. The pony car’s mechanical upgrades include coilovers, Baer brakes, and a Ford Racing V8 engine. The allure of the Eleanor Mustang may have worn thin for some, considering how many classic Ford Mustangs have been converted into replicas over the years. However, this particular 1967 Mustang, designed to pay homage to the Eleanor from Gone in 60 Seconds, offers something special—it’s a convertible. This extensively modified Mustang is currently up for sale in the U.S. and was converted into an Eleanor back in 2011. It’s barely been driven—just about 1,800 miles (2,896 km) since the transformation—and stands out as one of the cleaner, more well-preserved examples we’ve seen. Read: After A Two-Year Wait, Man’s New Mustang Dark Horse Stolen Right Before Delivery Adorning the Ford’s custom bodywork is luscious gray paint contrasted with silver racing stripes running over the hood and tailgate. Like the finest Eleanor Mustangs, the front fascia includes a more aggressive bumper and grille with additional lights. A set of 18-inch American Racing Shelby Cobra wheels have been installed and are wrapped in 275/35 Hankook Ventus S1 Noble2 tires. Many of the important mechanical parts of the classic muscle car have been brought into the modern world. For example, there are aftermarket coilovers up front, while track bars and longitudinal leaf springs are found at the rear. The ‘Stang also has a power-assisted steering rack and Baer brakes at all four corners with drilled and slotted rotors. Power comes courtesy of a 460 cubic-inch Ford Racing V8 with an Edelbrock Performer intake manifold, an aluminum radiator, Hedman headers, and dual electric radiator fans. Bring a Trailer There’s no official word on how much power this thing is cranking out, but we’re assuming it’s enough to make your hair stand up, even if you don’t have a mullet. What we do know is that the V8 is mated to a three-speed automatic transmission that sends all that unspecified muscle to the rear wheels. On the inside, the layout is mostly original, as if it were frozen in time… but with some upgrades for your listening pleasure. There’s a RetroSound head unit, Kicker speakers, and a subwoofer. The wood-rimmed steering wheel makes you feel like a boss, while the black vinyl seats give you that “retro cool” vibe, but without the creaky springs of a car that’s seen better days. If this 1967 Mustang Convertible Eleanor replica scratches that very specific itch you’ve got, head over to Bring a Trailer and place a bid. It won’t be around forever, and honestly, you could do a lot worse than owning this one. Bring a Trailer",
