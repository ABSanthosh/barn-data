  "description": "Five years after its debut in India, the BMW 2 Series is being replaced by a newer, second-generation model. Like its predecessor, it’s high on style and design, but there are a few caveats – most notably, a new downsized engine. Can it still deliver the best of BMW in a compact and stylish package? BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218: exterior design and engineering 9/10 Design remains its calling card, with sharp looks and increased dimensions. Based on the same UKL2 platform as before, which underpins BMW’s front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive cars, the new F74 2 Series Gran Coupe has grown in size. Although the wheelbase remains unchanged, length, width and height have all increased. Styling is sharp and eye-catching, but it’s less polarising compared to its BMW peers. At the front, it features a shark-nose profile, with a bonnet that swoops down and a bumper that angles upward, giving it a distinct shark-snout appearance. Redesigned adaptive headlamps are sleeker and have new LED DRLs.  The adaptive LED headlamps have been redesigned, and since this is the M Sport version, the bumpers sport sharp cuts and blacked-out elements. The modestly sized grille is now backlit, highlighting its signature look at night. From the side, the car appears more proportionate, thanks in part to the striking 18-inch wheels. While the wheel size remains the same, the tyre profile has increased from a 40 to a 45 section, slightly raising the overall height and boosting ground clearance to around 165mm. The rear has a clean design, devoid of a spoiler or exposed exhaust tips.  The swooping coupe roofline remains as stunning as ever, and the iconic Hofmeister kink has been subtly updated with the numeric ‘2’ embossed within. As before, the Gran Coupe features frameless doors for added style. At the rear, the design is more subdued, with simple individual LED tail-lamps and a clean overall look – no ducktail spoiler, no exposed exhaust tips. Overall, the sleek design is exactly what you’d expect from a Gran Coupe. BMW has played it safe here, avoiding the polarising look seen on some of its other models. BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218: Interior Space and Comfort 6/10 Focused and minimalist interior, but rear seat space is disappointing. The interior follows the minimalist theme found in modern BMWs. The dashboard is largely devoid of physical buttons, integrating most functions into the touchscreen. The padded dash feels plush, and ‘M’ stitching adds a touch of flair. Ambient lighting beneath the AC vents change colour – red when you increase the temperature, blue when you decrease it. Dashboard design is minimalistic and sporty with lots of soft touch materials The curved glass panel merging the infotainment and instrument cluster is angled towards the driver. Though responsive and slick, the touchscreen interface is not very user-friendly. Even basic functions like adjusting the AC demand too much attention. Below the screen, there’s a wireless charger, two cup holders, and some space to store small items. The centre console houses a cluster of buttons for quick access to the gear selector, drive modes and camera. The front seats are sporty, with firm bolsters and adjustable under-thigh support for both driver and passenger. The M Sport steering wheel is chunky and adds a sporty touch. The driver’s cockpit remains a highlight for enthusiasts. Rear seat space is cramped, especially the headroom. Rear seat space continues to be a drawback. The coupe-like roofline reduces headroom, and the unchanged wheelbase limits kneeroom. Passengers over six feet will find it cramped. While rear AC vents and a panoramic sunroof help open up the cabin, it’s still not comfortable enough for long journeys. If the dark mocha interior feels too sombre, a brighter upholstery option is available to enhance the sense of space. 430-litre boot houses a space-saver spare wheel under the floor.  Boot space stands at 430 litres. The 2 Series no longer comes with run-flat tyres, so a space-saver spare wheel is stored under the boot floor. BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218: Features and Safety 8/10 Decent equipment, but some basic features are missing. With most functions integrated into the touchscreen, better usability would have helped. There’s wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a crisp 360-degree camera and automatic parking. Drive modes change the car’s theme and setup, while safety and assist systems are helpful for highway driving. Thankfully, in erratic city traffic, these systems can be switched off manually. New Digital Key feature allows several functions to be controlled via your phone.  Safety features include Lane Keep Assist, autonomous emergency braking, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert. However, some basic features like ventilated seats, rear blinds and adaptive cruise control are missing. A new feature is the Digital Key, which allows remote control of basic functions such as lock/unlock, cabin pre-cooling, and boot access – all via smartphone – and can be shared with up to five users. There’s also a roof-mounted camera that can record video and photos, exportable to your phone. Roof-mounted interior camera can be used to record both photos and videos.    BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218: Performance and Refinement 6/10 Downsized engine not up to par; performance and refinement are average. The biggest change in the new 2 Series Gran Coupe is the updated powertrain. The 1.5-litre, 3-cylinder turbo-petrol engine makes 156hp and 230Nm – comparable to midsize sedans like the Hyundai Verna Turbo. 1.5-litre, 3-cyl turbo-petrol engine makes 156hp and 230Nm At idle, vibrations are felt through the steering and seats. It smoothens out once in motion, but acceleration isn’t particularly exciting. Power delivery is linear, and the engine becomes audible past 4,000 rpm; not coarse, but not sporty either. Switching to ‘Sport’ mode improves throttle response slightly, but not enough. With its sporty seating and BMW badge, you’d expect more punch, but it’s lacking. There is a ‘Boost’ mode, similar to larger BMWs, but since it lacks a 48V mild-hybrid system, it doesn’t add power. Instead, it tweaks the gearing electronically for quicker torque delivery, aiding overtakes; 0-100kph takes 8.6 seconds. Performance is progressive, not sporty; 0-100kph takes 8.6 seconds  The 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox performs well – smooth, quick and responsive through paddle shifters. It won’t hold gears indefinitely, but it doesn’t upshift too early either. Sedate driving suits the 2 Series best. The chassis, gearbox and suspension could easily handle more power. BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218 Mileage 8/10 No diesel option, but smaller engine promises better efficiency. We couldn't conduct a full Autocar fuel test during the first drive, but BMW claims 16.35kpl. Unlike the previous generation, there is no diesel option – so the small-displacement petrol engine is the only contributor to efficiency. BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218: Ride Comfort and Handling 8/10 Stiff suspension helps handling, but low-speed ride suffers. The handling is where the 2 Series redeems itself. Despite the lack of power, BMW has worked its magic on the chassis, steering and suspension. Dampers have been reworked, and tweaks to the front axle – like changes to the caster angle – enhance agility. Wider tyres also help grip, but apart from minor torque steer, the handling is sharp and engaging. It lacks pace, but redeems itself with agile handling.  Bends and twisties are enjoyable, and while it lacks straight-line speed, it shines in corners. The downside is ride quality. The stiff suspension is great for spirited driving but poor on city roads. Thuds from bumps and potholes are pronounced, and the ride lacks the comfort expected in daily use. Still, it feels like a BMW from behind the wheel – even though its front-wheel drive. BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218: Price and Verdict 7/10 A style statement with badge value, but lacking in substance. Upon launch, it is expected to be priced between Rs 50-52 lakh (ex-showroom). The biggest challenge for the new 2 Series Gran Coupe is convincing buyers there’s more to it than looks. Prices aren’t out yet, but it’s expected to cost around Rs 50 lakh-52 lakh, making it the entry point to the BMW brand. While it scores high on style, features and handling, it falls short on comfort, practicality and engine performance. That said, if you’re after design, tech, agility and the BMW badge, it still holds strong appeal.

It smoothens out once in motion, but acceleration isn’t particularly exciting. Power delivery is linear, and the engine becomes audible past 4,000 rpm; not coarse, but not sporty either.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSwitching to ‘Sport’ mode improves throttle response slightly, but not enough. With its sporty seating and BMW badge, you’d expect more punch, but it’s lacking. There is a ‘Boost’ mode, similar to larger BMWs, but since it lacks a 48V mild-hybrid system, it doesn’t add power. Instead, it tweaks the gearing electronically for quicker torque delivery, aiding overtakes; 0-100kph takes 8.6 seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/BMW_2_Series_Front_Tracking.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePerformance is progressive, not sporty; 0-100kph takes 8.6 seconds \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox performs well – smooth, quick and responsive through paddle shifters.

Despite the lack of power, BMW has worked its magic on the chassis, steering and suspension. Dampers have been reworked, and tweaks to the front axle – like changes to the caster angle – enhance agility.
