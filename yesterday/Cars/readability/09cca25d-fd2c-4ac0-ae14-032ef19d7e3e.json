  "text": "Following a sizable update last year, Mercedes is giving the EQS a second refresh January 13, 2025 at 19:46 by Michael Gauthier Mercedes appears to be working on a second facelift for the EQS, following an update last year. Changes are limited, but the prototypes have been equipped with new ‘starry’ headlights. One of the cars appears to have suffered a breakdown as it was being towed by a G-Class. Sales of the Mercedes EQS and EQS SUV plummeted 52% in the United States last year. That’s a dreadful showing, but the company introduced an updated sedan with an AMG Line front bumper and a revised grille that mimics the one found on the S-Class. Designers also added a hood ornament as well as an updated interior with more comfortable rear seats and additional chrome. Engineers even got in on the action as the model was equipped with a larger 118 kWh battery pack, which provided an extra 51 miles (82 km) of range under the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure. More: The 2025 EQS Actually Looks Like A Mercedes Now Those were welcome changes, but it appears Mercedes wasn’t ready to call it a day. Quite the opposite as spy photographers have snapped two prototypes, which hint at a second minor facelift. While there isn’t much to see, we can clearly make out new headlights with star graphics. These have been seen on a number of recent prototypes including the CLA and S-Class as well as the GLE and GLS. Interestingly, the star graphics are only found up front. However, since most models are slated to get starry taillights, we wouldn’t be surprised to find them on the production EQS. There doesn’t appear to be any other changes at this point, but it’s hard to be certain with the camouflage. That being said, one of the prototypes apparently suffered an issue as it was seen being towed behind a G-Class. There’s no word on what happened, but the stricken EQS had power as the lights were on. SHProshots",
