  "description": "Hyundai has officially teased the Ioniq 6 N all-electric performance sedan ahead of its global debut scheduled for July 2025. The tease came as part of the recent unveiling of the facelifted Ioniq 6 and its N Line variant, where the full-blown N model was hiding in the background of one image. Hyundai Ioniq 6 N teaser reveals two rear spoilers, larger diffuser, and more Interior to get three-spoke steering wheel, N-specific badging and drive modes, sports seats 84kWh, dual-motor powertrain likely; 650hp, 0-100kph in 3.4 seconds, 448km range The Ioniq 6 N’s formal reveal is scheduled for July 2025, possibly at this year’s Goodwood Festival of Speed. Hyundai Ioniq 6 N exterior and interior design Gets two rear spoilers Hyundai Ioniq 6 N Line used for representation. Although the image partially shows off the Ioniq 6 N’s rear end, the performance EV is immediately recognisable thanks to the hallmark Performance Blue finish popularised by Hyundai’s N models. Furthermore, the Ioniq 6 N sports two rear spoilers - a ducktail extending from the boot, and a larger wing mounted right beneath the windshield - and the N logo is in clear view on the blacked-out tailgate. The rear bumper includes a chunky diffuser, which looks to be inspired by Hyundai’s race-inspired RN22e concept car, and has red accents like other N models. While the front end remains a mystery for now, it’s expected to feature design elements similar to the newly-revealed Ioniq 6 N Line, including sporty color-contrasting strakes in the grille cover. Simon Loasby, Head of Hyundai Design, confirmed to our sister publication Autocar UK that the  Ioniq 6 N’s design changes are intended to “maintain aerodynamic performance while achieving a smoother, more refined silhouette.” Loasby also revealed that the large rear wing was added to counter lift more effectively, and that the Ioniq 6 N will have wider fenders than the Ioniq 5 N. Ioniq 6 N to offer exclusive interior features The Ioniq 6 N’s cabin is anticipated to largely resemble that of the regular facelifted model, but include the Ioniq 5 N’s performance features, such as a three-spoke N steering wheel, N badging, exclusive drive mode buttons, sporty front bucket seats, and more. Hyundai Ioniq 6 N powertrain and performance Hyundai Ioniq 6 N Line used for representation. Under the hood, the Ioniq 6 N will likely share the Ioniq 5 N’s 84kWh, dual-motor powertrain with simulated automatic gear shifts. This setup yields 650hp, a 0-100kph time of 3.4 seconds, and a top speed of 260kph in the Ioniq 5 N, with a WLTP-tested range of up to 448km.
