  "description": "This 1990 Ferrari 348 TS was said to have been purchased by the seller's father in 1997 and was sparingly driven prior to the seller's 2024 acquisition. Reconditioning work was performed in July 2024 by Boardwalk Ferrari in Plano, Texas, which included performing an engine-out belt service, cleaning the fuel system, and replacing various sensors, gaskets, hoses, and ignition components. The steering rack was rebuilt in January 2025. The car is finished in Rosso Corsa over tan Connolly leather and is powered by a 3.4-liter DOHC V8 linked with a dogleg five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Features include 17″ alloy five-spoke wheels, a removable roof panel, a gated shifter, power windows, and an air conditioning system that has been converted to utilize R134a refrigerant. This 348 shows 17k miles and is now offered with the owner's manual, service invoices, a clean Carfax report, and a bonded Texas title in the seller's name.",

Reconditioning work was performed in July 2024 by Boardwalk Ferrari in Plano, Texas, which included performing an engine-out belt service, cleaning the fuel system, and replacing various sensors, gaskets, hoses, and ignition components. The steering rack was rebuilt in January 2025. The car is finished in Rosso Corsa over tan Connolly leather and is powered by a 3.4-liter DOHC V8 linked with a dogleg five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Features include 17″ alloy five-spoke wheels, a removable roof panel, a gated shifter, power windows, and an air conditioning system that has been converted to utilize R134a refrigerant. This 348 shows 17k miles and is now offered with the owner’s manual, service invoices, a clean Carfax report, and a bonded Texas title in the seller’s name. The 348 was the final V8-powered Ferrari model developed under the direction of Enzo Ferrari, and its design was overseen by Pininfarina chief stylist Leonardo Fioravanti. This example is finished in Rosso Corsa with black lower-body panels and features a removable black roof panel, pop-up headlights, fog lights, side air intakes, louvered tail lights, and quad exhaust tips. The front and rear lid supports and the trunk seal were replaced in July 2024. The 17″ alloy five-spoke wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot All Season tires that were installed in July 2024. Stopping power is provided by Ferrari-branded calipers over ventilated discs along with an anti-lock system. The steering rack assembly was rebuilt in January 2025. Tan Connolly leather covers the sport seats, lower dashboard, and center console, which are joined by black leather upper surfaces. The leather trim was reconditioned, and the rest of the cabin was refreshed in July 2024. Equipment includes a dogleg-pattern gated shifter, a heated rear window, power windows, and an air conditioning system that has been converted to utilize R134a refrigerant. Nakamichi speakers are installed behind the headrests. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames Veglia Borletti instrumentation including a 200-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 7,500-rpm redline, and gauges for coolant temperature and oil pressure. Auxiliary gauges for oil temperature and fuel level are mounted in the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 17k miles, approximately 5k of which have been added under current ownership. The 3.4-liter quad-cam Tipo F119 V8 features Bosch Motronic engine management and was factory rated at 296 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque. In July 2024, an engine-out belt service was performed as a part of the reconditioning. Additional work completed at that time included cleaning the fuel system and replacing the camshaft sensor, crankshaft position sensor, spark plugs and wires, battery, engine mounts, oxygen sensors, and various hoses, wiring, and gaskets. The catalytic converter temperature ECUs and exhaust temperature sensors were replaced in January 2025. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage. There is a bond on the Texas title.
