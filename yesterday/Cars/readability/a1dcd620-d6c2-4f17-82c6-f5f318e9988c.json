  "text": "Published:  May 12th, 2025 Jaguar reportedly has fired its ad agency following a laughably botched rebranding. Some folks derided the failed campaign as being too \"woke\" but I don't think that was the issue. The campaign was universally panned, even from those, like me, who have no issue with, and in fact encourage, the inclusion of diversity. No, the problem was that the campaign seemed off the mark from a company known for old-school luxury. Also, the brand has little in the way of future product right now and was relying heavily on odd-looking concept vehicles. Perhaps any campaign would be doomed. Personally, I think a Jag ad campaign featuring men and women of all skin colors, including members of the LGBTQ community, can work. So the ideology wasn't the issue -- but perhaps the pastels were.When I think of Jaguar I think of quiet, smooth luxury with some models injecting plenty of performance. I think of quiet British manors and British Racing Green, not colors more commonly associated with South Beach signage.So, were I in charge, I'd work to combine the classic Jaguar imagery with the realities of 2025 -- including using a diverse cast in ads. But that's me. What would you do?Sound off below.[Image: Jaguar]Become a TTAC insider.

Tim Healey Tim Healey grew up around the auto-parts business and has always had a love for cars — his parents joke his first word was “‘Vette”. Despite this, he wanted to pursue a career in sports writing but he ended up falling semi-accidentally into the automotive-journalism industry, first at Consumer Guide Automotive and later at Web2Carz.com. He also worked as an industry analyst at Mintel Group and freelanced for About.com, CarFax, Vehix.com, High Gear Media, Torque News, FutureCar.com, Cars.com, among others, and of course Vertical Scope sites such as AutoGuide.com, Off-Road.com, and HybridCars.com. He’s an urbanite and as such, doesn’t need a daily driver, but if he had one, it would be compact, sporty, and have a manual transmission.
