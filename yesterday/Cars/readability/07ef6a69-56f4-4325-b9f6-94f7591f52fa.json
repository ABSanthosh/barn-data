  "description": "Mini India has announced a new scheme to pass on the benefits of any reduction in the Cooper S’ price to customers. It is called the Price Protection Assurance and is only valid on the Mini Cooper S, which is produced at the brand’s plant in Oxford, United Kingdom, and imported as a CBU.  The price protection programme can be availed at any Mini India dealer Mini Cooper S ex-showroom price range is Rs Rs 44.90 lakh-55.90 lakh India-UK FTA could result in a price reduction; hence the scheme Mini Cooper S Price Protection Assurance programme explained Cooper S buyers will receive benefits of any price reduction until 180 days after purchase Under the programme, the Mini 3-Door Cooper S buyers will receive benefits of any price cut until 180 days after the purchase. The programme is only available for a limited period and can be availed at any authorised Mini India dealership. The Mini Cooper S’ starting price is Rs 44.90 lakh, and it is available with the Classic Pack (Rs 50.45 lakh), Favoured Pack (Rs 53.40 lakh) and JCW Pack (Rs 55.90 lakh).   Speaking about the scheme, Vikram Pawah, president and CEO of BMW Group India, said, “Mini has always stood for innovation and a bold character. With the price protection assurance programme for Mini 3-Door Cooper S, we are staying a step ahead and ensuring that customers are able to receive the full benefit of any major price reductions resulting from anticipated duty cuts. They can buy their favourite Mini today and do not have to wait longer to make the purchase decision.” Do note that Mini’s press release adds that the all-electric Mini Countryman is not covered under the offer as it is built at the BMW Group plant in Leipzig, Germany.  Mini Cooper S price could reduce in the coming days India-UK free trade agreement could benefit Cooper S buyers As we’ve reported, some UK-made models being imported to India could see a price reduction with the recently signed India-UK free trade agreement (FTA). As per the pact, India will reduce tariffs on “high-end cars” imported from the UK from 100 percent to just 10 percent. However, both governments still need to clarify several details, and that has led to buyers being unsure of making their purchase. British brands in India, like Mini and JLR, are seeing fewer enquiries as customers are waiting to see exactly what it means for them. The Mini Cooper S price protection programme should help ease some of those uncertainties.
