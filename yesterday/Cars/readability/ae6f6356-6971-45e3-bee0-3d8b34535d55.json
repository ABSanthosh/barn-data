Equipment includes a fairing with a clear windscreen and a black two-up seat with a passenger seat cover as well as a Ceriani fork, a monoshock, triple Brembo disc brakes, a pair of Dell’Orto PHF carburetors, and a dual exhaust system with Brevetti Silentium silencers. The bike was acquired by the seller circa 1994, and service has included replacing the oil sight glass in 2017 and the timing belts in March 2024. This 750 F1-S is now offered with an owner’s manual, a tool kit, removed parts, service records, and a clean North Carolina title in the seller’s name. The 750 F1 is the road-going version of the marque’s race-winning F1-B and was the final Ducati superbike designed prior to the Caviga takeover in 1985. This example wears a red, white, and green tricolore paint scheme over a red-finished trellis frame and features a full fairing with a clear windscreen and a biposto tail section with an integrated tool tray and a removable cover for the passenger portion of the stepped two-up seat. Additional equipment includes fairing-mounted mirrors, rear-set foot controls, folding passenger foot pegs, and a center stand. The turn signal assemblies are reproductions sourced from Germany via Moto Motivo of Raleigh, North Carolina, and the fuel petcocks have been replaced. The seller notes speckling on the finish of the exhaust pipes along with paint scratches on the edge of the seat cap where it slides on the body. Close-up photos that show where a right-side seat cap screw came loose from the seat pan can be viewed in the gallery. The seat cap screw is included. Oscam alloy wheels measuring 16″ up front and 18″ at the rear are finished in red and mounted with older 120/80 front and 130/80 rear Michelin Macadam tires. Adjustable suspension consists of a Ceriani fork as well as a monoshock mounted to the swingarm. Braking is provided by triple Brembo calipers over drilled discs. Clip-on handlebars secured beneath the upper triple clamp front an asymmetrical instrument panel housing a Veglia Borletti 160-mph speedometer and a matching tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline. The five-digit odometer shows 4,800 miles, approximately 4,500 of which were ridden by the seller. The 748cc L-twin features a desmodromic valvetrain, a pair of 36mm Dell’Orto PHF carburetors, an electric starter, an oil cooler, and a black-finished two-into-two exhaust system equipped with Brevetti Silentium silencers. Service performed at Moto Motivo included replacing the oil sight glass in 2017 and replacing the timing belts and changing the oil in March 2024. Power is transferred to the rear wheel by way of a multi-disc dry clutch with hydraulic actuation as well as a five-speed transmission and a drive chain. The bike is accompanied by an owner’s manual, a tool kit, service records, and the removed turn signal assemblies. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
