  "description": "The BMW R 12 GS has been teased on the brand’s global website, and is set to be unveiled on March 27. It is an enduro bike that shares its engine and fundamentals with the R 12 nineT roadster. R 12 GS will be unveiled at 9:30pm IST on March 27 Will use a 21/17-inch (F/R) wheel setup with knobby tyres To feature longer suspension travel and higher ground clearance BMW R 12 GS unveil date It will sport minimal bodywork and a purposeful stance In the first quarter of 2024, BMW Motorrad’s chief, Markus Flasch confirmed that the brand is working on an off-road enduro motorcycle. It gets an air-oil cooled motor shared with the R 12 nineT roadster, borrowing its fundamentals while making it purposeful to suit its intent. The R 12 GS will be a raised R 12 nineT with 21/17-inch (F/R) wheels, wrapped in knobby off-road rubber. It could also get longer suspension travel and a purposeful stance. It will be more closely linked to the earlier HP2 Enduro than the GS 1300. In essence, it will be to the R 12 nineT what the Ducati Desert Sled is to the Scrambler Icon. According to earlier leaked images of the R 12 GS, it features a single-sided swingarm and a shaft final drive– just like its roadster sibling, although with a more upswept exhaust and higher ground clearance. It will be packaged as an enduro motorcycle with minimal bodywork and expected lighter kerb weight. At its heart will be a 110hp, 115Nm, 1,170cc, air/oil-cooled, boxer twin mated to a 6-speed gearbox. However, it could come in a different state of tune. Also see: BMW CE 02 road test, review",
