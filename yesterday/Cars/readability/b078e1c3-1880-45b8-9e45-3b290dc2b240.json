  "text": "The high-performance Mercedes-AMG E53 wagon has outputs of 577 hp and 604 hp April 8, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier The 2026 Mercedes E53 Wagon will arrive in the United States later this year. It joins the E450 All-Terrain and features a plug-in hybrid powertrain with up to 604 hp. Customers can opt for a special edition with AMG graphics and unique touches. The party continues for high-performance wagon fans as Mercedes-AMG has announced the E53 is coming stateside. It follows hot on the heels of the BMW M5 Touring, which went on sale earlier this year. Mercedes didn’t have much to say about the car, but it closely echoes its European counterpart and will ride on 20-inch wheels. 21-inchers will be available as an option as will be AMG Night, AMG Night Plus, and AMG Exterior Carbon Fiber packages. More: The 2025 Mercedes-AMG E53 Is A Pricey Plug-In Hybrid With A Straight-Six The company was similarly vague about the interior, but we can expect MB-Tex and Microfiber upholstery as well as a standard 17-speaker Burmester 4D surround sound system. Furthermore, like the E450 All-Terrain, the model should have a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and a 14.4-inch infotainment system. An assortment of options will be available including AMG Performance seats and Nappa leather. Customers can also opt for an MBUX Superscreen, which adds a 12.3-inch front passenger display. Power and Poise On the performance front, there’s a plug-in hybrid powertrain that consists of a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six, a 28.6 kWh battery, and an electric motor that is integrated into a nine-speed automatic transmission. This gives the car a combined output of 577 hp (430 kW / 585 PS) and 553 lb-ft (749 Nm) of torque. Those generous numbers enable the wagon to rocket from 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in four seconds flat and hit a limited top speed of 155 mph (250 km/h). Speaking of performance, the E53 comes standard with rear-axle steering and an AMG Ride Control suspension with adaptive damping. Want More? There’s a Package for That If the standard model isn’t hardcore enough, you can opt for the AMG Dynamic Plus package. It adds a Race Start mode that increases the output to 604 hp (450 kW / 612 PS) and lowers the 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) time to 3.8 seconds. Besides the extra oomph, this variant has active engine mounts, a limited-slip rear differential, and an increased top speed of 174 mph (280 km/h). They’re joined by a leather and microfiber AMG Performance steering wheel as well as a composite braking system with red calipers. Special Edition, Special Treatment Buyers looking for something more unique can opt for the Edition 1 variant. It features a unique Manufaktur Alpine Grey exterior with AMG graphics and 21-inch forged wheels. The company also said we can expect distinctive accents as well as a “specially curated interior with unique design elements and an extensive suite of standard equipment.” While Mercedes hasn’t announced an official arrival date or pricing for the E53 Wagon, it’s expected to cost a few thousand dollars more than the E53 Sedan, which starts at $88,000 plus a $1,150 destination fee. That would still make it significantly more affordable than the Audi RS6 Avant ($126,600) and the BMW M5 Touring ($121,500), even if those models are playing in a slightly higher league. 2026 Mercedes E53 Wagon Edition 1",
