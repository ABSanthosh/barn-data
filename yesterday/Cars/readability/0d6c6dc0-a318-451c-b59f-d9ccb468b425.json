  "text": "The original class action alleges that GM breached new vehicle warranties by failing to fix the issue November 10, 2024 at 19:22 by Brad Anderson GM is facing two class action lawsuits after owners reported ongoing issues with shifter assemblies. If the shifter fails to register Park, the engine cannot be turned off, leaving owners stranded. A trial date has been set for January 13, 2025, to address the ongoing legal battle. A number of Chevrolet, GMC, and Buick models are currently the focus of two class action lawsuits in the United States, alleging a significant problem with the shifter assembly that can prevent vehicle owners from turning off their cars. The lawsuits claim that this issue, which affects various GM models, could leave drivers in a dangerous position if their vehicles fail to properly shift into Park and refuse to shut down. The first lawsuit, filed in Memphis, Tennessee, claims that certain General Motors vehicles flash a persistent “Shift to Park” message on the dashboard, even after the shifter has been placed in Park. Some owners report resorting to the time-honored tradition of jiggling the shifter—often multiple times—just to get the car to recognize that, yes, it is indeed in Park. Read: GM Has Sold More Than 300,000 EVs In America On the surface, this may not seem like a serious fault. However, if the vehicle stubbornly refuses to acknowledge it’s in Park, owners may be left stranded with an engine that won’t shut off. This failure to shut down can lead to a host of issues, such as draining the battery if the vehicle is left idling for too long, potentially leaving owners stranded or forced to call for roadside assistance. GM has reportedly known about the fault for quite some time. In fact, it sent a technical service bulletin to GMC dealers in June 2018 stating that vehicles may not shut off when in Park. Fast forward more than six years, and a fix does not appear to have been developed to rectify the issue. GM will now have to face up to court, as a trial has been scheduled for January 13, 2025. The original lawsuit was brought forward by plaintiff Rilla Jefferson, who claims she began experiencing these shifter headaches in her 2017 GMC Acadia. The owner alleges that GM breached the vehicle’s warranty and that her dealership never attempted to repair the fault. The United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee granted class certification for the lawsuit last year for purchasers and lessees of eligible Acadia models. While this lawsuit only relates to GMC Acadia models, a separate class action filed by Mark Riley alleges the same issues and has been certified as a class to include purchasers and lessees of the 2017-2019 GMC Acadia, 2019 Chevrolet Blazer, 2016-2019 Chevrolet Malibu, 2018-2019 Chevrolet Traverse, and 2016-2019 Chevrolet Volt. Additionally, Buick Encore models manufactured between 2020 and 2023 are included in this expanded suit.",
