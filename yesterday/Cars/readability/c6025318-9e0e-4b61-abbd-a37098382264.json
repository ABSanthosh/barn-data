  "description": "The Lexus ES sedan has received a second facelift in international markets, suggesting that the new, eighth-gen model is still some time away. Revealed at the recently concluded Auto Guangzhou show in China, the refreshed ES gets changes to its exterior design, and less buttons on the inside. Incidentally, the ES sedan is not only a popular model for Lexus in India, accounting for 58 percent of the brand’s sales in October, but it’s also an in-demand model in China, where over 10 lakh units have sold so far. ES facelift gets RX-inspired grille design Gets new 14-inch touchscreen infotainment Remains mechanically unchanged On the outside, the updated ES sports a new design for the spindle grille that seems to be inspired by the RX. There are new, sharper, matrix LED headlights with new boomerang-shaped DRLs. An LED light bar now connects the mildly tweaked tail-lights, which also get L-shaped LEDs. The cabin of the ES now features a larger 14-inch touchscreen infotainment that also houses all the controls for the climate control system – there are fewer physical buttons overall, especially around the centre console and gear lever. What Lexus calls a ‘Silver Lance Moon Ridge’ trim can also be seen on the dash and doors. Buyers in China will be able to spec their ES in a Snowy Night White interior theme, or a two-tone Tanzanite Snow Night. The ES facelift doesn’t get any mechanical changes for the Chinese market, and is likely to be brought to India in the same manner. In India, it gets a 218hp, 2.5-litre petrol-electric hybrid powertrain and retails at Rs 64.00 lakh-69.70 lakh. It rivals the Mercedes E-Class, BMW 5 Series and Volvo S90. While an India launch date is uncertain, expect Lexus India to bring the refreshed ES here next year.
