  "description": "This 1986 Buick Regal Turbo-T is powered by a turbocharged and intercooled 3.8-liter V6 linked to a four-speed automatic transmission and limited-slip differential, and it was previously owned by Dennis Kirban of Kirban Performance, per the seller. The seller acquired the car in 2016 and had it modified with a UMI Performance suspension kit, larger fuel injectors, an aftermarket downpipe and exhaust, 17\" Augment Wheel Company wheels, and a Kenwood stereo system. Additionally, the transmission and rear end were rebuilt, and the car was refinished in metallic red. This modified Regal Turbo-T is now offered with service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Maryland title in the seller's name.",

The seller acquired the car in 2016 and had it modified with a UMI Performance suspension kit, larger fuel injectors, an aftermarket downpipe and exhaust, 17″ Augment Wheel Company wheels, and a Kenwood stereo system. Additionally, the transmission and rear end were rebuilt, and the car was refinished in metallic red. This modified Regal Turbo-T is now offered with service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Maryland title in the seller’s name. The car was refinished in metallic red in 2022, and the grille, headlight bezels, front air dam, and bumper fillers were replaced. LED headlight and tail light bulbs were also installed. Paint imperfections are shown in the gallery. Staggered-width Augment Wheel Company 17″ alloy wheels and Hankook tires were mounted under current ownership. The suspension has been modified with a UMI Performance suspension kit, which included Bilstein shocks, Eibach springs, UMI stabilizer bars and control arms, and a track bar. The car is equipped with power steering, and braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums. A vacuum brake conversion was completed in 2017, and the rear brake drums were rebuilt. A power steering leak is noted. The interior is trimmed in red cloth with matching carpets, floor mats, and plastic panels. Equipment includes a power-adjustable driver’s seat, cruise control, power windows and locks, and air conditioning. A rear seat brace is said to have been installed under previous ownership. A Kenwood Bluetooth stereo and replacement speakers were installed, and the heater core was replaced under current ownership. The leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel frames an 85-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and fuel-level and turbo-boost gauges. A boost-pressure gauge is affixed to the left A-pillar, and water temperature and oil pressure gauges are mounted ahead of the shifter. The five-digit odometer shows 84k miles, approximately 7k of which have been added under current ownership. The turbocharged and intercooled 3.8-liter V6 was modified with an adjustable wastegate actuator, a breather bypass kit, and an RJC air flow distribution plate under previous ownership. Modifications beginning in 2017 include 42.5-pound fuel injectors, an EPROM chip, a Walbro GSS340M fuel pump, a billet fuel pressure regulator, a 3″ downpipe, a 160-degree thermostat, and an aluminum three-row radiator. The mass air flow sensor was replaced in 2018, the alternator, rear main seal, and serpentine belt were replaced in May 2021, and the oil was changed and the coolant was flushed in 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential. Work in May 2021 involved rebuilding the transmission and replacing the Positraction, torque converter, and axle bearings. A Hooker dual exhaust system with Vibrant Performance resonators is fitted. Corrosion is present on underside components. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
