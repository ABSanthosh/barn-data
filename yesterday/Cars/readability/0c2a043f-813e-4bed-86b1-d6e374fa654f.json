  "text": "The special edition Amarok commemorates a Guinness World Record for the fastest crossing of Australia’s 10 deserts November 23, 2024 at 19:19 by Thanos Pappas A Volkswagen Amarok set a record by crossing Australia’s 10 deserts in record time. The modified truck completed 6,421 km (3,990 miles) in just 6 days and 17 hours. VW Australia is releasing an Amarok 10 Deserts Edition to commemorate the feat. The second-generation Volkswagen Amarok might live in the shadow of its closely related sibling, the Ford Ranger, but VW has a knack for keeping things interesting. The German brand recently dialed up the appeal with a Guinness World Record-breaking feat: the fastest crossing of Australia’s 10 deserts. This stunt has now inspired a special edition of the Amarok for the Australian market. Starting with the impressive record, a team of experienced drivers, including Rainer Zietlow, Marius Biela and Brad Bowman, piloted the Amarok across Australia’s grueling 10-desert expanse. Covering the Strzelecki, Sturt Stony, Simpson, Pedirka, Great Victoria, Gibson, Little Sandy, Great Sandy, and Tanami deserts, the team completed 6,421 km (3,990 miles) of challenging terrain in 6 days and 17 hours, which is the fastest anyone has done it in the past.

According to reports from local outlet CarExpert, the truck suffered just one tire puncture during the adventure and guzzled 1,199 liters of diesel along the way. That works out to an average consumption of 18.7 liters per 100 kilometers (12.6 MPG). Not exactly frugal, but pretty impressive when you’re battling endless sand dunes and rock-strewn trails. Desert-Ready Swagger Predictably, the record-breaking Amarok looks like a proper overlanding vehicle thanks to a number of accessories. These include off-road bumpers, extra LEDs, a roof rack, a snorkel, a fancy livery, and four spare tires on the rear bed. VW Amarok Guinness World Record Car Unfortunately, the production-ready “10 Deserts Edition,” while functional, dials back the visual drama significantly. Its cosmetic upgrades are limited to black decals on the doors, a black tonneau cover, and matching 17-inch wheels set against a white exterior. Let’s just say it’s not winning any beauty contests against the record-breaking prototype. Beefed-Up Protection The highlight of the 10 Deserts Edition is a 40 mm (1.6-inch) lift on the suspension, resulting in a ground clearance of 275 mm (10.8 inches). Additional underbody protection and chunkier tires round out the package, ensuring the Amarok is better equipped to handle rugged Australian landscapes. More: VW Amarok Converted Into An Overland Camper Under the hood is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder twin-turbo diesel engine (TDI 500), though it feels like a missed opportunity considering the record-breaking truck boasted the more potent 3.0-liter V6 (TDI 600). With no power upgrades, the Ford-sourced engine delivers 207 hp (154 kW / 209 PS) and 500 Nm (369 lb-ft) of torque. Power is channeled to all four wheels through a 10-speed automatic gearbox. Competent, but not exactly inspiring given the context of the special edition’s origins. Price and Exclusivity Set to land in Australian showrooms by the second quarter of 2025, the 10 Deserts Edition will slot between the Amarok Life, priced at AU$59,490 (US$38,700), and the Amarok Style, at AU$69,740 (US$45,400). Volkswagen has yet to reveal the production numbers for this market-specific model, but it’s safe to assume that exclusivity will play a part in its allure. VW Amarok 10 Deserts Edition",
