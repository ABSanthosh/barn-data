  "text": "Based on the previous-generation Colorado, the 100 Years edition features cosmetic and suspension upgrades 1 hour ago by Thanos Pappas Chevrolet has launched a new special edition of the S10 midsize truck in Brazil. The S10 100 Years sports a new bumper, black decals, and a raised suspension. It will be produced in 100 units, exclusively available for the Brazilian market. Chevrolet is celebrating 100 years in the Brazilian market with a special edition of the S10 pickup. The model features exterior upgrades and a beefed-up suspension. Only 100 units will be produced, and they’ll all be exclusively available in Brazil. The Chevrolet S10, for those who haven’t been keeping track, is essentially the updated version of the previous-gen Colorado. Last year, the midsize truck received a facelift that brought it more in line with its American counterpart, updating its styling and technology for a more modern look. More: VW Teases New Pickup Truck For South, But Not North America The 100 Years Edition stands out with a few noticeable changes, starting with the new front bumper, which now houses an extra set of LEDs. Other updates include a sporty hood attachment and a roll bar with body-colored side arms. The truck is finished in an exclusive Dunas White color, complemented by mountain-inspired decals and black accents. The special edition is based on the high-spec Z71 trim of the midsize truck, which comes with all the standard features you’d expect, including an 8-inch digital instrument cluster, an 11-inch infotainment screen, wireless charging, and a full suite of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Additionally, it gets upgraded upholstery with red stitching on the seats, which complements the red accents on the dashboard. Suspension Upgrades, Same Engine One of the highlights of the 100 Years Edition is its suspension, which was upgraded by off-road specialists Ironman. With revised springs and shock absorbers in the front and leaf springs at the rear, ground clearance is increased by 30 mm (1.2 inches). This makes the S10 better suited for off-road conditions, especially with the 18-inch wheels wrapped in Scorpion Plus All-Terrain tires. The engine remains the same 2.8-liter turbodiesel four-cylinder, producing 204 horsepower (152 kW / 207 PS) and 510 Nm (376 lb-ft) of torque. While the engine itself didn’t get any major changes, it did receive some updates last year to improve performance and fuel efficiency, thanks to AI-based calibration. For the 2026 model year, GM also added an extra filter designed to reduce harmful emissions by up to 84%. Pricing and Availability The Chevrolet S10 100 Years Edition is now available to order in Brazil, with a price tag of R$325,690 (equal to $57,300 at current exchange rates). Only 100 units will be produced at the Sao Jose dos Campos factory, so if you want one, you’ll need to act fast. In addition, Chevrolet plans to offer 100 Years editions of the Onix subcompact hatch and Tracker SUV in the near future. Chevrolet",
