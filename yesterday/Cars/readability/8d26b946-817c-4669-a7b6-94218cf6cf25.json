  "text": "The Ford Ranger boasts impressive towing capability, but a few new variants help build out the midsize truck's lineup to better appeal to a global market.The Ford Ranger has a reputation as a tough midsize truck that can handle most weekend jobs and off-road excursions with ease. Now Ford is expanding the pickup’s lineup with one important caveat: neither of the upcoming Ford Ranger variants will make their way to the United States market. Instead, the primary focus will be building out the Ranger portfolio to appeal to a broader market overseas.The Ford Ranger Super Duty will head to AustraliaFirst, Australia gets the Mazda BT-50, and now this? The Land Down Under will see a more powerful version of the midsize Ford Ranger hitting their roadways in 2026. While the Ford Ranger is a muscular truck in itself, the Ranger Super Duty tuwill harbor capabilities rivaling that of its larger sibling, the Ford F-150.The Ford Ranger Super Duty offers enhanced towing and hauling capabilities, with towing capacity topping out at 9,920 lbs. The standard Ford Ranger maxes out at 7,500 lbs., which means the Super Duty version offers nearly a 33% increase in towing capability.Ford RangerJames RiswickWith that kind of capability, the F-150 is right to feel threatened, especially since the Ford Ranger Super Duty exceeds the towing capacity of the full-size truck in some setups. On top of that, the F-150 is imported and then converted to a right-hand drive. That extra step to enter the Australian market makes the full-size truck a good deal more expensive than its midsize sibling. The Ranger Super Duty will also be marketed as a fleet vehicle, potentially cannibalizing the F-150’s sales even further.“Ranger Super Duty further strengthens our commercial vehicle portfolio, with an offering for all kinds of work. As we move closer to launch, we will continue to work closely with fleets and vehicle modifiers across Australia to be sure that Ranger Super Duty does everything they expect it to, and so much more,” said Andrew Birkic, President and CEO of Ford Australia and New Zealand.The United States won’t see the Ford Ranger PHEV eitherWhen Ford announced that the plug-in hybrid Ranger would make its debut for the 2025 model year, they also revealed that it would only be available in Australia, Europe, and New Zealand.The Ford Ranger PHEV combines a 2.3-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine with a 75 kW electric motor and 11.8 kWh battery. The midsize pickup will offer a total all-electric range of around 28 miles at its launch in early 2025. Thanks to its battery and Pro Power Onboard system, owners can power their tools and equipment using the Ranger’s battery.The Ranger PHEV will be available in Wildtrak, Sport, and XLT trims, as well as the PHEV-exclusive Stormtrak launch edition. The limited edition trim features a Chill Grey finish, 18-inch wheels, a honeycomb grille, a decal kit, a flexible rack system, and a B\u0026O sound system.“We ensured our first PHEV pickup in Australia and New Zealand would be a hugely capable tool for work and off-roading, as well as a smart vehicle with the tech, connectivity, and EV-only capability for family life,” said Andrew Birkic, President and CEO, Ford Australia and New Zealand.Final thoughtsWhile I’m glad to see Ford is expanding the Ranger lineup, it's bittersweet to know we won’t be getting either model in the United States. While Ford does have a handful of fuel-efficient vehicles in its North American lineup, adding to the Ranger, one of the most popular midsize trucks in the United States, couldn’t hurt.With the F-150 holding its own as a staple of the American automotive industry, keeping the Ranger Super Duty and its higher towing capacity in foreign markets is probably a smart move - for the time being, anyway.",
