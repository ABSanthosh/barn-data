  "text": "The updated Tesla Model Y joins Rivian's R1S SUV and R1T pickup truck in enabling matrix LED headlight technology in the United States.The tech allows for pixel-by-pixel control to shape the headlight beam, avoiding blinding oncoming drivers.Such headlights are already widely available elsewhere, but U.S. regulations present a stumbling block.Anyone who has driven a car equipped with the old sealed-beam headlights from the 1980s will know that modern LED lighting technology is one of the greatest improvements of the modern automotive age. Sure, the flexibility of LEDs allows car designers to use lighting as a styling element, but the main advantage is that you can better see things when you're driving around in the dark. Who could have guessed that'd be a good idea? One drawback, though, is that poorly aimed LED headlights can temporarily blind oncoming drivers. Now, the solution for this is finally starting to trickle into the U.S. market.The tech has various names depending on what brand is offering it, but we can start by calling it matrix LED headlights since Audi was among the first to bring it to market (just not in the U.S.—more on that in a bit). Think of an LED headlight working as a constellation of light pixels rather than a single source, so individually controlling those pixels allows you to shape the light beam projected by the headlight.AudiAudi RS Q8 headlights.In Canada, where Audi's matrix LED headlights are legal, this allows for headlights that will dip to the left so as not to shine through the windshield of fellow drivers when oncoming traffic is detected. At the same time, the headlights can light up more to the right or follow through a corner, allowing the driver to see more of the nighttime world without blinding anyone.Audi launched this technology back in 2014, when U.S. transportation rules only allowed for high-beam, low-beam, and nothing in between. Since then, a 2022 rule change allowed for \"Adaptive Driving Beam\" (ADB) headlights theoretically but adopted a testing method that differed from the SAE-approved regulations used in Europe and Canada. Audi would have had to come up with a completely new solution just for the U.S. market, so it simply delivered vehicles with the tech software disabled. It's much the same case with some recent BMW models.RivianRivian R1S headlights.However, the second generation of Rivian's R1S and RIT trucks did come with ADB headlights that meet U.S. regulations. They were enabled back in August 2024, making them the first in America. The refreshed 2025 Tesla Model Y is also now available with this technology, though it should be noted that Canadian and European Model Ys already had a version of it. A Tesla spokesperson told Car and Driver that the ADB headlights are not yet enabled on older versions of the Model Y and Model 3.Now that matrix LED headlights are available from some manufacturers, it may push others to come up with a solution that will meet U.S. regulations. The sealed-beam era of headlights is best dimly remembered. Brighter headlamps that aren't a hazard to others are the kind of technology that should light the way forward.Brendan McAleer is a freelance writer and photographer based in North Vancouver, B.C., Canada.
