Finished in Designo Alanite Gray Magno over black upholstery, it is powered by a 6.2-liter V8 linked with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The car was optioned with 19″ and 20″ 10-spoke alloy wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes, gullwing doors, a carbon-fiber rear wing, bi-xenon headlights, heated power-adjustable seats, carbon-fiber exterior and interior accents, COMAND infotainment, and dual-zone automatic climate control. This SLS AMG Black Series was purchased by the owner in 2020 and is now offered on dealer consignment with a battery tender, the owner’s manual, partial service records, clean US and Canadian Carfax reports, and British Columbia registration. The SLS AMG Black Series was unveiled at the 2012 Los Angeles Auto Show and was the fifth Black Series model developed by AMG. The car is 154 pounds lighter than the standard SLS AMG, and features include a wide-body kit, revised aerodynamics, a titanium exhaust system, and a carbon-fiber hood as well as an increase of carbon-fiber components in the drivetrain and spaceframe. This example is finished in Designo Alanite Gray Magno and features gullwing doors with pop-out handles as well as bi-xenon headlamps, a carbon-fiber rear wing, straked front fender vents, power-folding mirrors, carbon-fiber mirror caps, and quad exhaust outlets. Staggered-width 19″ and 20″ 10-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. The SLS AMG Black Series features an AMG Ride Control suspension with electronically controlled two-stage damping, speed-sensitive power steering, and a wider track compared to the standard SLS AMG. Stopping power is provided by AMG-branded brake calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners. The heated power-adjustable AMG sport seats are trimmed in black upholstery with red seatbelts and contrasting stitching that extends to the dashboard, center console, and door panels. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include AMG-branded floor mats, bright pedals, a rearview camera, dual-zone automatic climate control, and COMAND infotainment with navigation. The microsuede-wrapped steering wheel features aluminum shift paddles and frames a 360-km/h speedometer and a tachometer as well as gauges for oil temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 9k kilometers (~6k miles). The hand-assembled 6.2-liter M159 DOHC V8 was revised for the Black Series with modified camshafts, shorter intake runners, and revised valve timing. Output was factory rated at 622 horsepower and 468 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery. The US Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. A Canadian Carfax report is presented in the gallery. The vehicle is being sold on its British Columbia registration, which serves as the ownership document in British Columbia, Canada. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
