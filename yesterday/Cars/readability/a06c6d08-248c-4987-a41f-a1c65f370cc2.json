  "text": "You’re sure to face opposition calling something the first of its kind, but the consensus is that the BMW R80G/S invented the large-displacement dual-sport scene—a segment that flourishes today. The R80 and its successor the R100GS combined the best of BMW’s road-going features with increased suspension travel and the new ‘monolever’ swingarm in a form that excelled on any terrain, setting the stage for hundreds of thousands of dual-sport BMWs since. For all their timeless rugged charm, you wouldn’t call either bike stylish in a traditional sense, prompting a unique challenge for the craftsman at Stile Italiano. Nestled in the province of Pordenone, Stile Italiano started in 1996 as a venture between motorcycle nuts with a common passion for vintage bikes, racing and craftsmanship. All manners of classics and customs have rolled through their doors, and this 1991 BMW R100GS is among their most ambitious creations. Melding unique streamlined style with the off-road prowess that defines the G/S, ‘Crossover’ is a dual-sport BMW like no other. As with every good airhead, the iconic 1,000 cc boxer engine remains the centerpiece of this build. The original camshaft, transmission, clutch, and drive system were retained, ensuring the bike retained its authentic character. However, the fuel system has been updated with Mikuni 40 mm carburetors with compact velocity stacks, improving throttle response and overall engine performance. Stile Italiano then crafted a complete exhaust system for the bike with the headers exiting into a fabricated muffler from VireX. Stile Italiano’s attention to detail extends to every corner of the bike, but the elephant in the room is surely the handmade monocoque body. Crafted specifically for this build, the alloy bodywork mimics the chunkiness of the BMW’s original fuel tank, but works in a fixed fairing and styled solo saddle. The shape flows seamlessly from end to end, interrupted only by functional details like the frenched-in motogagdget chronoclassic gauge, billet fuel cap and integrated rear LED lighting. With its aesthetic transformed, Stile Italiano invested heavily in the R100’s suspension to retain its rugged character. The stock telescoping fork was ditched and replaced with an inverted Öhlins FG424 43 mm fork and billet triple clamps from the Triumph Bonneville Scrambler. Out back, the original monolever swingarm was used but brought into the modern era with the addition of an Öhlins BM836 shock absorber. Fit with a 21/17-inch wheel combo, the BMW is reminiscent of the early R80 off-roaders, but with modern Pirelli Scorpion rubber and spoke lacing. While its dramatic bodywork is a significant diversion from stock, Stile Italiano worked in functional details throughout the bike that reminds us it’s meant to be ridden. A pair of slim bobbed fenders were mounted to keep debris at bay and a full Brembo radial brake package was used up front. Electronic ignition, LED lighting, motogadget switchgear and a new Tommaselli throttle replace the BMW’s outdated components and polished foot controls are adjustable for rider preference. If the going gets rough, a covered Hella off-road light is there to guide your path and a slim skidplate protects the airhead’s underside. As with any good custom outfit, Stile Italiano is on to the next build, and it’s time for the Crossover BMW R100GS to find its forever home. With only 200 kilometers since its rebuild, this bike is essentially brand new, offering a rare opportunity to own a classic BMW restomod—available now through the Bike EXIF Classifieds. If you’re looking for a motorcycle that combines the best of both worlds—heritage and modern performance—then look no further than the Stile Italiano R100GS. It’s not just a bike; it’s an experience.",
