  "text": "Expect these compact Hondas to arrive with wilder styling than we've seen before December 17, 2024 at 19:08 by Stephen Rivers The Tokyo Auto Salon takes place from January 10 through 12, 2025. Honda will showcase two major compact cars, including a new Prelude prototype. The Civic Type R Racing Black package will also make an appearance at the event. Few auto shows around the world highlight racing and modified vehicles quite the way the Tokyo Auto Salon does. One of the largest players at the 2025 show is Honda and it’s bringing a pair of unseen cars, namely an updated Prelude prototype and a unique Civic Type R. Held at Makuhari Messe in Chiba Prefecture from Friday, January 10 to Sunday, January 12, 2025, the Tokyo Auto Salon will host at least nine Hondas. They’ll all sit in the Honda SPORTS booth which focuses on how the brand’s history of performance affects its current direction. To that end, it’ll have important motorsports vehicles like the Red Bull F1 car. More: Honda Prelude Prototype First Drives Confirm Paddle Shifters And Civic Interior What we’re most excited about though are the two new cars Honda hasn’t shown us yet. First, it tells us that an updated Prelude prototype will be on the scene. Evidently, this new Prelude has some aero parts to “enhance its sportiness.” Notably, Honda announced today that the production version of the Prelude will begin rolling off of the line in late 2025. The original Honda Prelude Concept from 2023 Now, the nameplate might stir high-revving VTEC memories among car enthusiasts, but its modern iteration will be a two-motor hybrid-electric coupe with simulated gear shifts. We expect this prototype at the Tokyo Auto Salon to be more or less the same as the one Honda has displayed so far. Even so, it’ll likely add more aggressive aero features and perhaps a new paint color to the mix. Honda Civic Type R Racing Black Package In addition, Honda says it’s bringing a Civic Type R with a “Racing Black Package” to the mix. Obviously, that indicates a bunch of black badging and perhaps some dark accents or black wheels. Interestingly, the fact that this is called a “racing” package could also indicate that it might feature some upgrades over the stock model, although we’ll likely have to wait until next month to find out.",
