  "text": "The Buffalo Bills wide receiver joked about his car, saying other players tease him about it 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier NFL player Khalil Shakir recently revealed he drives a 2021 Subaru. Despite signing a $60.2 million contract, he plans on keeping the car. He’ll eventually get something new, but it won’t be “anything crazy.” The Buffalo Bills lost out on a trip to the Super Bowl, but wide receiver Khalil Shakir recently signed a four-year contract that is said to be worth up to $60.2 million. That’s a lot of dough, but Shakir isn’t planning to splurge on a Bentley, Lamborghini or Rolls-Royce. Quite the opposite as he has a 2021 Subaru and plans on keeping it. Speaking during a recent press conference, Shakir said “I’ll put myself on blast a little bit, but I drive a Subaru.” He went on to say other players make fun about what he drives and one even joked, ‘Congrats, now you can get yourself another car.’ More: Ludacris Gets His 1993 Legend Restored By Acura Shakir didn’t say which particular model he owns, but laughed about it and said he got the car when he landed in Buffalo. The player added that he doesn’t splurge much and that he’ll eventually get a new car, but it won’t be “anything crazy.” Shakir went on to say he cares about his vehicle and it’s just a “normal white Subaru with tinted windows.” This stands in stark contrast to a number of professional athletes who like showing off their wealth. Unfortunately, supercars and superstars tend to be a bad combination as we’ve seen plenty of crashes and run-ins with police over the years. That being said, Kirk Cousins drove a 2000 GMC Savana conversion van that he bought from his grandparents. Sports Illustrated also noted Alfred Morris drove a 1991 Mazda 626 that he bought in college for $2.",
