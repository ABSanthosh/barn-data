  "description": "This 1967 Ford Mustang is one of two fastbacks that were modified when new by Carrozzeria Zagato in Milan, Italy. Zagato's work involved fitting bespoke front bodywork with a hood scoop, a narrowed grille, and rectangular Carello headlights as well as repainting the car from white to Holly Green and retrimming the front seats in two-tone upholstery. The car was taken off the road by its original owner in 1984 and remained in storage until 1995, when it was sold to the family of the current owner, Fabio Di Pasquale. Di Pasquale repainted the car white, as it had left the Ford factory, and it was driven regularly for the next two decades until a refurbishment was carried out c.2019. Since then, it has participated in the 2021 Mille Miglia and graced the pages of Autoitaliana and Octane magazines. The car is powered by a 289ci V8 linked to a four-speed manual transmission, and it has wheel covers, air conditioning,  a push-button radio, and a center console. This Mustang GT Zagato Elaborazione is now offered in Italy by the seller on behalf of the owner with a FIVA identity card and Italian registration.",

Since then, it has participated in the 2021 Mille Miglia and graced the pages of Autoitaliana and Octane magazines. The car is powered by a 289ci V8 linked to a four-speed manual transmission, and it has wheel covers, air conditioning,  a push-button radio, and a center console. This Mustang GT Zagato Elaborazione is now offered in Italy by the seller on behalf of the owner with a FIVA identity card and Italian registration. Zagato modified the front bodywork with a narrowed grille, a smoothed valance, rectangular Carello headlights, a modified bumper with turn signals mounted above, and a revised hood with an air scoop. The car was then painted Holly Green, and turn signal indicators were mounted atop the bumper. Zagato Elaborazione badges were also added to the front fenders. The car had left the Ford assembly plant finished in Wimbledon White (M), and it was repainted that color in the 1990s and again two decades later. In order to obtain certification from L’Automotoclub Storico Italiano, the car was refinished in Holly Green in 2019 in accordance with a confirmation letter from Zagato that is presented in the gallery. Decals from the 2021 Mille Miglia remain on the hood and doors. The 14″ steel wheels wear full covers and are mounted with older narrow-whitewall tires that require replacement. Braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums, and the car has a front sway bar. The low-back front bucket seats are trimmed in white with black inserts, while the folding rear bench, dashboard, and door panels have black vinyl upholstery. Brushed metal trim accents the center console, and additional appointments include air conditioning, a push-button AM radio, rear C-pillar vents, and a fire extinguisher mounted in the passenger footwell. Tears in the headliner are noted. The Deluxe steering wheel frames a 200-km/h speedometer and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 502 kilometers (~312 miles). Total mileage is unknown. The 289ci Challenger Special V8 is equipped with a four-barrel carburetor and wrapped stainless-steel headers that flow into a dual exhaust system with a crossover pipe. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission. The VIN is consistent with a 1967 Mustang fastback produced at the Metuchen, New Jersey, assembly plant and equipped with a 289ci Challenger Special V8 with a four-barrel carburetor. The warranty tag decodes as follows: 63A – Fastback with standard interior M – Wimbledon White paint 2A – Black vinyl upholstery 21B – February 21 build date 92 – Export sales district 1 – 3.00:1 Standard differential 5 – Four-speed manual transmission Documentation from Zagato on the car’s original color is provided above. The car has appeared in several publications, which are further displayed in the gallery along with photos taken during the 2021 Mille Miglia. The vehicle is being sold on its registration, which serves as the ownership document in Italy. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
