  "text": "Move over Mary Kay, Häagen-Dazs wants in on the action 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Häagen-Dazs has unveiled a custom 1963 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible. The one-off model was built by West Coast Customs and features an ice cream cone holder. The car helps to promote Häagen-Dazs’ Super Bowl commercial, which stars Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez. Häagen-Dazs is doubling down on their Super Bowl campaign by unveiling a 1963 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible. However, this isn’t your run-of-the-mill drop top as it has been transformed into the “ultimate ice cream vehicle” by West Coast Customs. Sporting a two-tone paint job inspired by Häagen-Dazs’ brand colors, the burgundy and cream Cadillac has been stripped of its usual chrome. That isn’t the only change as the model wears custom badges on its wheels, trunk, and front fenders. More: Häagen-Dazs Gets Fast And Furious For The Super Bowl Speaking of the trunk, it features a mirrored inner lid as well as a custom ice cream freezer. We can also see illuminated accents as well as what appears to be speakers and subwoofers. The two-tone appearance continues inside with cream leather seats and a burgundy leather dashboard. They’re joined by a custom center console that features an ice cream cone holder. Rounding out the highlights are special embroidery and a Häagen-Dazs logo on the steering wheel. According to West Coast Customs CEO Ryan Friedlinghaus, “Our full team worked in close collaboration with Häagen-Dazs to create a car worthy of ‘Not So Fast, Not So Furious.’ We kept authenticity at the core of this partnership to design a ride deserving of car aficionados and Häagen-Dazs fans alike.” The car will be driven from Los Angeles to New Orleans in a custom trailer, which has large windows to ensure the vehicle is visible at all times. Once it arrives in The Big Easy, it will be used to distribute Häagen-Dazs bars.",
