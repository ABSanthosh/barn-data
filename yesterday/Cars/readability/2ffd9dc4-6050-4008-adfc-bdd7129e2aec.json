This D-Series pickup is now offered by the selling dealer at no reserve with a clean New Jersey title. Part of Dodge’s mid-1970s “Adult Toys” lineup, the Warlock was based on the Dodge ½-ton Utiline stepside pickups and included specific trim and graphics, plus a pair of oak sideboards. This example is finished in Bright Red, and exterior features include Custom badges, a driver-side mirror, and a dropdown tailgate. The selling dealer states various body panels have been repainted. Gold-finished 15″ eight-spoke wheels are mounted with Goodyear tires. Stopping power is provided by front disc and rear drum brakes. The emergency brake cable was replaced in preparation for the sale. The cabin features a bench seat upholstered in black vinyl, and interior appointments include a heater, an AM radio, and wind-up windows. The three-spoke steering wheel frames a 100-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 78k miles. The 360ci V8 sends power to the rear wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission. The radiator was replaced in preparation for the sale.
