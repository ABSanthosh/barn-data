These are the features that homeowners’ associations loathe and do their best to rid their streets of. I can’t recall the last time I paid attention to a car at the side of the road, caked in dirt or moss. In London, they’re a nightmare, especially the abandoned vehicles occupying precious parking spaces and being general eyesores. They’re also a clear sign of neglect – cars that have never been washed, repaired or even cherished at all.  We’ve all let our cars get dirty now and then, perhaps even for an extended period. But to have a blatant disregard for your car’s condition? That’s another story. I could never feel comfortable owning a car with shabby paintwork and swathes of rust on display. I’m not even fond of brown paint on most cars, let alone rust peeking through what was once a nice finish. It’s a damn shame. And yet, how is it that patina can be so f*cking cool? A concours-level restoration is always impressive – the type of ‘better-than-new’ car that most enthusiasts dream of. Mint, all-original ‘numbers matching’ vehicles are fantastic, too. There’s a charm about a car that’s been preserved and cared for over decades of ownership. But in a less traditional sense, a mechanically sound car wearing 50 or 60 years of ‘personality’ is even more charming. This Series Land Rover is a perfect example, especially as I write this from the UK. There are immaculate Land Rovers here, owned by museums, and then there are those barely holding together after six decades of farm duty. Many aren’t even road-legal anymore, but that’s perfectly fine; they never leave the acres of fields they’ve been working in for their entire lives. On the other hand, you have restomods – old Defenders dressed up to mimic the last-of-the-line models. Think James Bond-esque builds, LS-swapped V8 beasts or even 6×6 monstrosities roaming the streets of central London. Those are the worst offenders. They’ll likely never see a muddy country road, let alone a farmer’s field or a forest trail. Meanwhile, this Series is a properly well-traveled piece of automotive history, used as intended. Look at the hand-drawn list of countries and dates on its bed cap. It’s staggering. This Land Rover has seriously lived up to its name, having journeyed from the former British territory of Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) down to South Africa and across Africa to Morocco, ultimately making its way to Jerez in Spain via Gibraltar. That’s a two-year, three-month road trip covering so many miles I can’t even begin to comprehend it. The bloody thing even made it to The Seychelles! I’ve been there, and it took me 13 hours on two planes. God knows how long it took on a ferry back in 1961. It would be a crime to alter a single thing about this Land Rover’s appearance. It’s earned the right to wear its battle scars and legacy proudly – its paint, its rust, and that iconic spare wheel on its bonnet. I’m sure that spade has helped it out of a tight spot more than once. Then there’s the 1967 Porsche 912E parked beside it, affectionately known as “Scruffy Bastard.” Registered in Oregon, USA, the 912 was a numbers-matching example until 2009, according to a local ad. After a valve spring broke, it sat parked, the engine and 5-speed gearbox removed, and the rest of the car stripped down. It found its way to the UK in 2019 as a rolling shell after its new owner, Gareth, discovered it as part of a big collection for sale in America. While it may not have lived as storied a life as the Land Rover, it’s amusing how something as minor as a valve spring breaking can drastically change a car’s fate. Without that break, the 912 might still be living a quiet life outside Junction, Oregon. Or if the owner had decided to keep it whole and tuck it away, perhaps it would have become a future ‘barn find’ for some aspiring influencer to base a YouTube series on in 2024. Instead, it’s now with someone who dreamt of owning a short-wheelbase Porsche and isn’t afraid to make it his own. To many, a ‘patinated’ P-car is sacrilege, but to Gareth, it’s a project he cherishes. I may be a die-hard fan of clean paint, shiny wheels, and a beautiful interior, but I must admit: cars that wear their stories on their sheet metal never fail to put a smile on my face.
