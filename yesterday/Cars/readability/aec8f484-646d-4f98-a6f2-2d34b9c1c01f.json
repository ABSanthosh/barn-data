  "text": "A new feature turns your Audi into a gaming hub with QR access and phone controls June 27, 2025 at 20:28 by Brad Anderson The AirConsole is available on several Audis with Android-based infotainment. Supported games include Uno Car Party! and Who Wants to Be A Millionaire? The platform runs on the central infotainment or available front passenger screen. For anyone who remembers when turning the key and adjusting the radio was the full extent of a car’s “tech features,” modern interiors can feel like stepping onto the bridge of a budget spaceship. In the past decade, we’ve reached a point where dashboards are crammed with screens, turning the once-simple cabin into something that feels more like a mobile tech showroom. It’s a trend that might not age gracefully for a couple of reasons. First, advancing tech will inevitably render today’s hardware outdated, and second, when something breaks, it definitely won’t be a cheap fix. Still, automakers are leaning into the screen-heavy future, packing in features and entertainment options that would’ve seemed ridiculous not long ago. Read: Rockstar Just Gave Us A Sneak Peek Of GTA VI’s Explosive New Chapter Audi is the latest to join the ranks. Several new models which include Android-based infotainment systems can now access AirConsole. This is a special in-built gaming platform that includes different games that can run on the central infotainment screen or the MMI passenger display offered by Audi for some of its latest cars. The games include Uno Car Party!, a special version of Pictionary, and even Who Wants to Be A Millionaire? Tesla led the charge with infotainment-based games, but what’s interesting about Audi’s AirConsole is that by scanning a QR code, passengers can use their smartphone as a gaming controller. For models with the passenger display, it’s even possible to play while the car is in motion,as a special dynamic privacy mode will block the screen from the driver’s view. Owners can download AirConsole now through the Audi Application Store. Importantly, it’s only currently available on new Audi A5, Q5, A6, A6 e-tron, and Q6 e-tron. The German brand hasn’t said if or when other models will gain access to the gaming software. The AirConsole platform already features over 140 titles on its desktop version, including Overcooked, a co-op kitchen simulator that’s found a global fanbase in recent years. It’s not clear how many of these games might eventually make it to Audi’s in-car version, but expanding the library seems like a logical next step.",
