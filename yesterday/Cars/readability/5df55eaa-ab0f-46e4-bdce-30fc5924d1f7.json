  "description": "The Tata Curvv is set to follow the Nexon, Harrier and Safari in getting a blacked-out, Dark Edition model, a leaked dealer document shows. The Curvv Dark Edition is scheduled to launch in the coming weeks, before making its debut at the 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL), set to begin on March 22. Tata Curvv Dark Edition to get 125hp petrol and 118hp diesel options To be based on top-spec Accomplished trim Tata Curvv Dark Edition engine options Curvv Dark Editions to get petrol-MT, petrol-DCT, diesel-MT and diesel-DCT options Tata will offer the Curvv Dark Edition with two out of three engine options available with the mid-size coupe-SUV – the 125hp, 225Nm, 1.2-litre direct-injection turbo-petrol and the 118hp, 260Nm, 1.5-litre diesel. Both come with 6-speed manual and 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox options. Tata Curvv Dark Edition price, features and variants Curvv Dark Edition prices expected to be Rs 16.5 lakh-19.6 lakh Nexon Dark Edition interior used for representation only. As the leaked image shows, the Curvv Dark Edition will be based on the top-spec Accomplished trim, and will share the same features list and safety features. Highlights include 6 airbags, a 12.3-inch touchscreen, a 9-speaker audio system, gesture-controlled tailgate, a panoramic sunroof, ventilated front seats, reclining rear seats and an ADAS suite. Considering Nexon Dark Edition prices are about Rs 40,000 higher than the trims they are based on, expect a similar hike for the all-black versions of the Curvv. This means that Curvv Dark Edition prices are expected in the Rs 16.5 lakh-19.5 lakh region for the petrol model, while the diesel is expected in the Rs 16.8 lakh-19.6 lakh bracket.
