  "text": "May 22, 2025 9:00 PM EDTIf you know, you know Some vehicles, such as the Mazda Miata, Volkswagen Golf and Jetta, Toyota FJ Cruiser, and many others, have cult followings with strong communities of owners behind them who share inside jokes, advice, and general camaraderie amongst themselves both in real life and on internet forums and social media. The Jeep Wrangler is another cult vehicle on the exhaustive list, as many owners would tell you that the Jeep Life community has its own customs and practices that are shared amongst drivers behind seven-slotted grilles. This includes certain traditions like the “Jeep Wave,” a seemingly simple wave shared between Jeep owners with its own set of rules and restrictions that is thoroughly evolving and amended amongst Jeep owners and users on Jeep forums and communities on Reddit. This summer, storied rental car company Hertz is stocking some of its locations with fresh Jeep Wrangler 4xes to be rented for fun-in-the-sun action; however, it’s also giving a taste of Jeep ownership to its renters during their limited time with their Wranglers. Hertz will let you partake in “Jeep ducking” (but you might not want to) If you have noticed that some Jeep Wrangler owners in your area keep one or dozens of rubber ducks in visible view of their dashboards, you have come face to face with a fairly new phenomenon with Jeep Wrangler owners called “ducking.” In short, Jeep Wrangler owners would keep small rubber ducks (the kind used as bathtub toys), and if they encountered another Jeep Wrangler parked near them during their travels, they would put one of their rubber duck on the hood, bumper, or mirror as a friendly gesture of appreciation from one owner to another. However, Hertz is joining in on this phenomenon with its own fleet of Jeep Wrangler 4xes. To spread and educate renters on the culture around the Jeep brand, the rental car giant is hiding special Jeep-Hertz-branded rubber ducks inside the Wrangler 4xes it rents out. Though it makes sense to share these special ducks with other Jeep owners during their time with their 4xe, Hertz says that those who find these exclusive rubber ducks in their rentals can redeem them for discounts and free upgrades for future Hertz rentals. In a statement, Lucy McLellan, Jeep’s head of North American marketing, said that its partnership with Hertz comes as summer invites Jeep enthusiasts to remove the top and “enjoy the open-air freedom the Wrangler offers,” and also share a taste of “Jeep Life” with non-Jeep owners. “Our partnership with Hertz gives drivers who haven’t yet experienced the perks that come with Wrangler ownership the opportunity to see for themselves firsthand the joys of driving on the open road during their summer travels, receiving a ‘Jeep Wave,’ getting ‘ducked’ and taking part in a community culture that brings smiles to owners and passers-by around every corner.” Final thoughts I don’t own a Jeep Wrangler, but from what I observe day to day, it is nearly impossible to see one in North Jersey without any ducks. I know that the practice of Jeep ducking was started by the late Canadian Jeep enthusiast Allison Parliament, who passed away last year. In 2023, Parliament told MotorTrend that she started the practice as a coy and polite act of kindness and appreciation toward fellow Jeep Wrangler owners.  “Jeeps get ducked for many reasons and with lots of motivations and meanings. For me, it was an act of kindness, a healing of sorts, as well as recognition of and greeting to a fellow Jeep owner,” she said. “But it can just be that you like their Jeep, or it’s the same Jeep you have, or maybe a classic Jeep you would like to own one day. You don’t really need a reason for Jeep ducking other than to connect, bring a smile to someone’s face, and have fun.” The “ducking” practice is one of those niches that Wrangler owners are in or not in on, and some owners I have seen on my social media feed have been kind of hostile toward the whole thing. I do not see anything wrong with it; it’s one of those cool “if you know, you know” things like first-gen Mazda Miata owners “winking” their lights at other owners, or “SUBUWU” plates on Subarus. If there is one thing I could commend, it would be Jeep’s effort to recognize and be a part of the community that owns their cars. Even its care and owner support program is called “Jeep Wave,” with a logo like the gesture. And yes, they do sell official Jeep-branded rubber ducks.",
