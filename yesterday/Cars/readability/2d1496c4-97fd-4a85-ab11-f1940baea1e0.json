  "text": "Apr 21, 2025 12:05 PM EDTKia's latest hatchback is a sleek, stylish breath of fresh air in a world of crossover SUVs. During the 2024 New York International Auto Show, Kia unveiled the K4, a sleek, edgy compact sedan meant to compete with similarly sized and priced rivals like the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic. While the K4 sedan garnered attention for its sleek and futuristic design, curious compact car buyers were left waiting until this year’s New York International Auto Show, as Kia kept fans hungry with mere pictures of a K4 hatchback at the end of their presentation last year. However, the wait is finally over. During its presentation at the 2025 New York International Auto Show last week, Kia lifted the wraps off the real-life version of the K4 hatchback: a formidable hatchback contender that not only shares a lot with its sedan counterpart, but adds utility and versatility that will have some buyers reconsider their small crossover purchases. The K4 hatch is a little shorter than the sedan, but it packs more room for passengers and cargo Although they look similar in size from the manufacturer's pictures, the real numbers show that the five-door Kia K4 hatchback is actually 11 whole inches shorter than its four-door sedan sibling. The best way to describe the K4's styling cues is that it's all business in the front, while the real party is in the back, as the sedan and hatch look virtually similar until halfway around their respective B-pillars. Kia describes the unique rear space as a “floating roof design,” but some car design contemporaries would describe it as resembling a shooting brake or a wagon design. Despite the slightly “shrunken” proportions, Kia says that the K4 hatchback has the same amount of rear legroom as its sedan counterpart. At the same time, Kia notes that eliminating the 4-door's sloping roof design gains an extra inch of headroom for backseat passengers. As for cargo, the hatch opens up to 22 cubic feet with passengers in the backseat and 59 cubic feet with the seats folded. Although those numbers fall short of the 24.8 cubic feet of the Honda Civic hatchback, it's a vast improvement on the K4 sedan's 15 cubic feet of trunk space. The K4 hatchback also gets the same engines as the sedan. It comes standard with a 147-horsepower 2-liter inline four-cylinder engine mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), while the top-of-the-line GT-Line Turbo gets a 190-horsepower turbo 1.6-liter inline four connected to an eight-speed automatic. The mid-level GT-Line trim adds sportier suspension and some additional design touches to the K4 hatch, including 18-inch wheels, black trim, and a steering wheel with paddle shifters. However, upgrading to the Turbo model adds a sunroof, LED headlights, and bigger front brakes. However, apart from the added backseat and cargo space, the K4's hatchback interior has no notable changes from the sedan version. The dashboard of the hatchback version is a virtual mirror image of the sedan's, as it comes with the same gauge cluster and central infotainment screen that is displayed on a 30-inch combined digital display. Wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and a wireless phone charger come standard across all Hatchback trims, as well as a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist. Higher trims have available features including SynTex heated and cooled front seats, a Harman Kardon premium audio system, and an ultra-wide glass sunroof. Kia has not announced pricing for the K4 hatchback; however, it says it will go on sale at U.S. dealers in late 2025. Final Thoughts I can see the Kia K4 Hatchback becoming a strong competitor to Japanese rivals like the Honda Civic Hatchback and Toyota Corolla Hatchback based on its design cues alone. Though the K4 hatch isn't officially labeled a station wagon, its styling hits those notes and offers a fresh interpretation of a design that's still somewhat niche in the American market. In a world where mundane crossovers like the Honda CR-V, Tesla Model Y, and countless other [insert name]-Cross vehicles are replacing midsize and compact sedans to dominate the new car landscape, wagons are a formidable alternative to the SUV parade that is taking place. Wagons these days are either five-door speed demons (Audi RS6 Avant, BMW M5 Touring, Mercedes-Benz E53 AMG Hybrid Wagon), or gorpcore-styled “SUV alternatives” like the Subaru Outback or the Allroads, Cross Country's and All-Terrains from luxury automakers. I feel that the K4 Hatch fills that compact, normally-priced wagon-sized hole in some buyers' hearts, despite Kia not formally calling it one. If the price is right, I'd have a black, blue, or a silver one lowered on some Borbets.",
