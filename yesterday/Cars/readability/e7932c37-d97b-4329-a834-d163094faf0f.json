  "text": "The desert-themed models starts at $99,900 and are available to order today February 19, 2025 at 19:34 by Michael Gauthier Rivian has introduced the new R1T and R1S California Dune Editions. They have a unique paint job, special wheels, and a two-tone interior. The EVs have a tri-motor powertrain with 850 hp and 329 miles of range. Following last week’s sandy teaser, Rivian has introduced California Dune Editions of the R1T and R1S. They’re based on the tri-motor variants and are “inspired by the mesmerizing landscapes” of the deserts in the Golden State. The special editions have a unique California Dune exterior that pops with black accents. They’re joined by special 20-inch wheels that can be had in a matching California Dune finish or a contrasting Satin Graphite hue. More: 2025 Rivian R1S And R1T Combine Tired Looks With New Tech And More Power Buyers will also find an All-Terrain Package, which includes an air compressor as well as underbody protection. Up top, there are roof-mounted crossbars that hold Maxtrax recovery boards. Rounding out the highlights are a spare tire and a unique power tonneau cover on the R1T. The styling changes continue inside with an Adventure interior that combines Sandstone and Black Mountain upholstery. They’re joined by dark ash wood trim and stylish Chilewich floor mats. Motivation is provided by a tri-motor powertrain that combines a front-mounted electric motor with two more out back. This gives the models all-wheel drive as well as an output of 850 hp (634 kW / 862 PS) and 1,103 lb-ft (1,494 Nm) of torque. Thanks to those healthy numbers and a Max battery, the California Dune Editions can accelerate from 0–60 mph (0-96 km/h) in 2.9 seconds and travel an EPA-estimated 329 miles (529 km) between charges. Pricing starts at $99,900 for the R1T California Dune Edition, while the R1S will set you back $105,900. Both have delivery estimates of 1-6 weeks and they’re available to order today.",
