  "description": "We at Autocar India have a habit of setting new Guinness World Records, and our latest achievement is the ‘Greatest Temperature Change Achieved by an Electric Production Car’. The record-setting journey – made in a Mercedes EQS SUV 450 4Matic and piloted by Autocar India’s Rahul Kakar – started in Ranao in Rajasthan, and ended in Khardung La, Ladakh. The record figure for temperature variation is 51.2°C. Ranao, situated on the outskirts of Jaiselmer, had an ambient temperature of 47.5°C, while the temperature in Khardung La, one of the world’s highest motorable passes, stood at a frigid -3.7°C. Hence, the record figure of 51.2°C was achieved. Reflecting on this monumental achievement, Autocar India Editor, Hormazd Sorabjee, remarked, “Climate change is real – we’re feeling it, living it, and there is no greater emergency confronting our planet today. This unique Guinness World Records Title, which spans extremes of temperature change, is meant to draw attention to the existential crisis we face. At the same time, it highlights the remarkable diversity of India – a country of geographic extremes where a temperature swing of over 50 degrees Celsius is actually possible. And it’s fitting that this record attempt was done in the all-electric EQS 450 SUV. Switching to electric mobility is a clear step in combating climate change, and the phenomenal range of the EQS 450 SUV gave us the confidence to conquer the remote heights of Ladakh without the added worry of range anxiety on this challenging and historic drive.” Rahul Kakar, the man who drove the EQS 450 SUV on this record-breaking journey , said, “Having achieved a Guinness World Records title not too long ago, I was well aware of the challenges that come with such attempts. However, this one was very different and presented unique challenges, the biggest one being the weather, unpredictable and often deviating from the forecast. Thankfully, this was done in the lap of luxury, with the Mercedes-Benz EQS 450 4MATIC SUV, which drove effortlessly regardless of outside conditions. Most importantly, its phenomenal range meant I never once had to worry about range anxiety.\" For all the details on setting the Guinness World Records title, check out Recording Extremes: a new Guinness World Records™ title with the Mercedes-Benz EQS 450 SUV.
