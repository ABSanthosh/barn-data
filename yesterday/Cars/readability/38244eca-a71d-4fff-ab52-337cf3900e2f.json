  "description": "FINALISTS ANNOUNCEMENT: Before we announce our finalists, we want to take a moment to acknowledge all of the commenters who come here daily to share their expertise. Your efforts are of immense value to everyone who reads this site. We are happy to have a place for the community to honor your contributions, though only one of you will take home the prize. Here are your finalists! Leave a comment below to make your vote. We'll announce the winner on Thursday, January 16! @ValiantJim—who does in fact own a Valiant—faithfully representing the Mopar contingent. @SlowNRusty, with his voluminous knowledge of German automobiles. @BaronVonZeppelin—despite taking a title of German nobility, the Pontiac is his area of expertise. ORIGINAL POST: In 2022 we created the Cognoscenti Award in honor of our late friend and expert commenter Ed_L, and it's now in its third year. The Cognoscenti Award is distinct from the Most Valuable Commenter Award in that we're asking for your help in identifying members of the BaT community whom you deem the most knowledgeable, scholarly, and/or erudite in their chosen vehicular subject. Last year, this award was handed to Symbolic_International, aka Bill Noon—a font of valuable information about many significant cars, a good number of which he has driven at speed.",
