They’re adored by chopper and bobber riders, fans of vintage café racers and scramblers, scooterists, and anyone who loves the feeling of the wind in their face (and bugs in their teeth). Sure, an open face helmet won’t protect your face in a crash—but a good one can still safeguard the soft grey stuff between your ears. So if you do insist on riding in one, at least pick a decent three-quarter lid and leave the novelty ‘piss pot’ at home. Here are three options that I’ve tested extensively. Biltwell Inc. Bonanza Biltwell has a handful of killer full face helmets in their arsenal, but the open-faced Bonanza remains a mainstay of the Californian parts and apparel brand. As their website reads; “Some people prefer the winds of freedom to hit them squarely in the face.” Like all of Biltwell’s gear, the Bonanza helmet is affordable, simple, and stylish. It’s priced at just $129.95 for solid colors and $149.95 for graphic options, with not an ugly one in the bunch. A mix of matte and gloss colors is on offer, with either chrome or rubber trim along the edge. Made with an ABS outer shell and an EPS safety liner, the Bonanza sports a classic three-quarter design with a traditional D-ring strap. It fits true to size and is immediately comfortable—thanks to the quilted brushed fleece inner padding that’s not only plush to the touch, but also breathes well on hot days. It also cuts a slim profile, so you won’t look like a bobblehead wearing it. You’ll find a traditional three-snap setup across the top of the Bonanza, designed to accommodate a visor or peak. (It’s pictured here with a yellow Biltwell visor, but it’ll take just about any standard accessory, regardless of the brand.) The only real issue with the Biltwell Bonanza is that it only has DOT certification—so you can’t ride with it in Europe. I’ve also found that the inner padding tends to develop a little give over time. But since you can pop in new padding for a mere $29.95, that’s hardly a problem. That aside, the Bonanza’s biggest strength is that, like all of Biltwell’s helmets, it’s finished better than some helmets twice its price. [Biltwell Inc. open face helmets] HolyFreedom Stealth Based in Italy, HolyFreedom’s whole vibe is gear that shuns the norm. And nowhere is that more evident than in the outrageous HolyFreedom Stealth helmet. Inspired by stealth aircraft like the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, the HolyFreedom Stealth helmet’s calling card is its multi-faceted ABS outer shell. HolyFreedom claims that the unique shape makes the shell stronger, but it’s the visual effect that grabs attention. After all, there are only so many ways to design an open face helmet—so we applaud HolyFreedom for coloring outside the lines. The helmet’s design might seem kooky in photos, but once you see it in the flesh, it’s actually pretty rad. Light pops off the myriad angled surfaces like mad, even on the matte-finished helmet pictured here. Plus there’s a pretty sweet helmet lurking behind the left-field design. The removable padding uses a combination of brushed fleece and faux leather materials, with bold HolyFreedom branding in line with the brand’s bold aesthetic. Three snaps across the top let you add accessories, while a rubber goggle retainer strap at the back acts as more of a design feature than a practical consideration (given how low it sits). The Stealth’s chin strap shuns the typical D-ring closure for a nifty ratchet system. It’s a bit fiddly to adjust at first, but once it’s set up, it’s a cinch to get on and off. Available in matte and gloss finishes at €179.00 [about $184], the Stealth helmet uses two outer shell sizes across its four sizes (small to extra large). The safety layer features a multi-foam EPS core, and the helmet achieves the new ECE22.06 rating. Unfortunately, my head circumference puts me just beyond the reach of HolyFreedom’s size chart, so they sent me a smaller size for my wife instead. Before long, my youngest kid had stolen it as their daily school run lid. Both of them score it high on comfort—but while my kid loves the look of it, my wife politely refers to it as “an acquired taste.” [HolyFreedom open face helmets] Hedon Hedonist Starting at £429 [about $524] for basic colors, and reaching north of £500 for more intricate designs, the Hedon Hedonist helmet’s price is eye-watering. But it’s also one of the most beautiful helmets on my shelf—full face lids included. In the interest of full disclosure, I’ll admit that I was gifted a Hedon Hedonist while acting as a global ambassador for the Distinguished Gentleman’s Ride. So while I think it’s an impeccable piece of gear, I didn’t have to shell out for it myself—and I have trouble recommending it without wincing at the price. That said, if you have cash to burn and feel like adding the Hedonist to your getup, you won’t regret it. The Hedonist’s low-profile and lightweight outer shell is made from a fiberglass and carbon fiber composite and achieves both an ECE22.06 and DOT rating. Available in sizes from XS to XXL, it fits well out of the box. But what truly sets it apart, is how luxurious it looks and feels. Hedon finishes their shells by hand in their studio, using various materials that suit the paint job on each lid. My Hedonist (pictured here with a Biltell visor fitted) wears a delightfully vintage green and white finish, laid down with durable automotive paint. The interior features a soft, anti-bacterial faux suede lining, with genuine leather trim around the sides of the padding and shell, and brass hardware throughout. Like any decent heirloom piece, the Hedonist is also hard-wearing. Mine’s almost seven years old and still fits like the day I got it. The shell and leather bits are scuffed from constant abuse, the brass bits have developed a patina over time, and the liner, although mildly discolored, still smells fresh. If I was offered another Hedon Hedonist, I’d be hard-pressed to say no. [Hedon open face helmets]",

And nowhere is that more evident than in the outrageous HolyFreedom Stealth helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInspired by stealth aircraft like the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, the HolyFreedom Stealth helmet’s calling card is its multi-faceted ABS outer shell. HolyFreedom claims that the unique shape makes the shell stronger, but it’s the visual effect that grabs attention. After all, there are only so many ways to design an open face helmet—so we applaud HolyFreedom for coloring outside the lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/biltwell-bonanza-open-face-helmet-review-5-745x497.jpg\" alt=\"HolyFreedom Stealth open face motorcycle helmet\" width=\"745\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/biltwell-bonanza-open-face-helmet-review-5-745x497.jpg 745w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/biltwell-bonanza-open-face-helmet-review-5-420x280.jpg 420w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/biltwell-bonanza-open-face-helmet-review-5-180x120.jpg 180w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/biltwell-bonanza-open-face-helmet-review-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/biltwell-bonanza-open-face-helmet-review-5-570x380.jpg 570w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/biltwell-bonanza-open-face-helmet-review-5-135x90.jpg 135w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/biltwell-bonanza-open-face-helmet-review-5-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/biltwell-bonanza-open-face-helmet-review-5-258x172.jpg 258w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/biltwell-bonanza-open-face-helmet-review-5-360x240.jpg 360w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/biltwell-bonanza-open-face-helmet-review-5-720x480.jpg 720w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/biltwell-bonanza-open-face-helmet-review-5-275x183.jpg 275w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/biltwell-bonanza-open-face-helmet-review-5-150x100.jpg 150w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/biltwell-bonanza-open-face-helmet-review-5.jpg 1490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\"/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\nThe helmet’s design might seem kooky in photos, but once you see it in the flesh, it’s actually pretty rad.
