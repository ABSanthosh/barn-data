  "text": "The President didn't drive the car and only had it for a few months before his friendship with Musk imploded June 6, 2025 at 21:01 by Michael Gauthier President Trump has reportedly decided to sell his Tesla Model S. The move comes shortly after a very public spat on social media. Trump and Musk have avoided talking about each other today. It didn‚Äôt take long for one of the most unlikely political bromances in recent memory to unravel. What started as a high-profile show of support from Donald Trump for Elon Musk and Tesla has rapidly devolved into a chaotic public feud, complete with name-calling, conspiracy theories, and now, a garage sale. Last March, President Trump vowed to buy a Tesla as a ‚Äúshow of confidence and support for Elon Musk‚Äù as people were ‚Äúillegally‚Äù boycotting the brand. He went on to call Tesla ‚Äúone of the world‚Äôs great automakers‚Äù and praise Musk as a ‚Äútruly great American.‚Äù More: Trump Targets Musk‚Äôs Empire As Tesla Stock Tanks Hard Those feelings have soured significantly in the past few days. Musk got the ball rolling when he called Trump‚Äôs Big Beautiful Bill as a ‚Äúdisgusting abomination.‚Äù The attacks and insults grew from there as the outspoken executive eventually said Trump‚Äôs tariffs would cause a recession, before claiming the President was ‚Äúin the Epstein files‚Äù and ‚Äúthat is the real reason they have not been made public.‚Äù Trump fired back and threatened to terminate government contracts and subsidies for companies owned by Musk. The President also claimed the tech billionaire went ‚Äúcrazy.‚Äù White House The public spat has calmed down today, but The New York Times is reporting Trump has decided to sell his Tesla Model S. However, the vehicle is largely just a symbol as the Secret Service reportedly doesn‚Äôt allow him to use the car.

That being said, he shared a message from an Epstein lawyer claiming the notorious financier ‚Äúhad no information to hurt President Trump.‚Äù Elon, on the other hand, hasn‚Äôt stopped posting messages to X. While he has avoided attacking the President directly, he claimed ‚ÄúCongress is bankrupting America.‚Äù President Trump and Elon Musk hop in a Tesla!I really love how this car looks!
