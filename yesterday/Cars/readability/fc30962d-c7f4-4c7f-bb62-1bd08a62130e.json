Finished in black over Silver Grey leather upholstery, the car is equipped with 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels, a limited-slip differential, four-wheel cross-drilled and ventilated disc brakes, a sunroof, a rear spoiler, power-adjustable seats, a Kenwood head unit, and air conditioning. This 930 Turbo coupe is offered on dealer consignment with a clean Carfax report and a clean California title. The car is finished in black and features a sunroof, fog lights, a rear spoiler, stone guards ahead of the rear wheels, a rear window wiper, and dual exhaust outlets. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. Staggered-width 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels are mounted with Bridgestone Potenza tires. Braking is handled by four-wheel cross-drilled and ventilated discs. The power-adjustable front seats are upholstered in Silver Grey leather with darker piping and are complemented by a color-coordinated center console, door panels, and carpeting. Amenities include air conditioning, an analog clock, power windows, and a Kenwood head unit. The four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,700-rpm redline as well as a 170-mph speedometer and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, oil level, fuel level, and boost pressure. The six-digit odometer shows 99k miles. The speedometer was repaired in October 2024. The turbocharged 3.3-liter flat-six was factory rated at 282 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque. An engine rebuild was completed in 2017, at which time the intake and exhaust valves, rod bearings, main bearings, piston rings, timing chain rail, oil hoses, fuel lines, drive belt, spark plugs, and various gaskets and seals were replaced. The engine mounts were replaced in 2023 and the battery was replaced in 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The transaxle was rebuilt and the clutch, rear main seal, and sector shaft sleeve were replaced in February 2023. The seller notes that the options code sticker is present under the front hood.
