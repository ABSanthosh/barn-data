  "text": "We suspect you've never seen a Honda Accord that looks as ridiculous as this October 27, 2024 at 20:39 by Brad Anderson The front, rear, and sides of this Accord are bathed in bizarre carbon fiber aero parts. It seems as though the owner is obsessed with downforce or just likes making a statement. Over the years, we’ve encountered countless absurdly modified cars on American roads—vehicles decked out like someone walked through AutoZone blindfolded, grabbing every last aero accessory in sight. But this Honda Accord might just take the crown as the most over-the-top, wannabe 2 Fast 2 Furious racer we’ve ever seen. If there were a hall of fame for outrageous aftermarket mods, this would have a prime spot at the entrance. Spotted by Instagram user boostingbye3, what you’re looking at here is technically a Honda Accord, though calling it “ordinary” would be an insult to understatements everywhere. For reasons that defy logic, the owner has plastered the car with a hodgepodge of carbon fiber accents, most of which aren’t even close to being where they’re supposed to be. Read: 2025 Honda Accord Gains Dark SE Trim, Higher Prices The bizarre changes start at the front end where there is a weird splitter and a host of canards. Ordinarily, accessories like these can increase downforce over the front end, but we suspect these parts do nothing but create a whole heap of drag and turbulence. But it’s the sides of the Accord that are the most hilarious. Positioned on the front doors are Mugen-branded carbon fiber parts with small winglets and intakes. The rear doors then have several other carbon parts that appear to have been randomly slapped on, including what appear to be carbon skirts and lip spoilers, never designed to be affixed to a car’s doors. The rear end is just as wild and includes a towering wing, a lip spoiler, huge carbon winglets on the quarter panels, and what looks like a DIY diffuser. Capping it all off is a roof scoop—entirely non-functional, of course—that sits like a cherry atop this cake of chaos, a final flourish on one of the most outrageous Accord we’ve ever laid eyes on. Finishing touches include flared wheel arches at both the front and rear, a carbon fiber hood, and aftermarket wing mirrors. Surprisingly, the car rolls on a set of aftermarket wheels that are… dare we say it, actually quite nice? And the owner even splurged on a set of Michelin tires. It’s almost enough to make you wonder if there’s method to the madness. Almost. Photo _boostingbye3@Instagram.",
