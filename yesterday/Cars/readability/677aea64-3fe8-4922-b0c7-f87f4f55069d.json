  "description": "Hyundai is set to bolster the upper end of its Indian product line-up with the launch of the Palisade SUV in 2028, Autocar India can exclusively confirm. Much like the Hyundai Bayon compact SUV, the Palisade is yet another global model that the Korean carmaker plans to introduce in India by 2030 as part of an aggressive 26 product launch onslaught. Where the Bayon will compete with the Maruti Suzuki Fronx, though, the Palisade will slot in as Hyundai’s flagship model for India. Hyundai Palisade to launch in India with 2.5-litre petrol-hybrid powertrain The SUV gets a boxy and unique design with slatted headlights and tail-lamps Cabin gets dual-screen setup, 14-speaker Bose sound system, panoramic sunroof, etc Hyundai Palisade hybrid powertrain details 1,015km claimed driving range The Palisade debuts Hyundai’s next-gen hybrid powertrain, which will be offered with either a 2.5-litre 4-cylinder turbo-petrol or 1.6-litre 4-cylinder turbo-petrol engine. Owing to the Palisade’s size, the SUV utilises the former setup and ekes out a combined output of 334hp and 460Nm, with a maximum fuel efficiency of 14.1kpl and total driving range of 1,015km (claimed figures). Compared to a standalone 2.5-litre petrol engine, Hyundai claims that the Palisade’s hybrid setup delivers uplifts of 45 percent in efficiency, 19 percent in power, and 9 percent in peak torque. It’s worth noting that Hyundai also sells the Palisade with a 290hp, 353Nm, 3.5-litre petrol V6 in overseas markets, but we expect it to come solely with the hybrid powertrain in India. A 6-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel drive layout are standard on the Palisade hybrid, but Hyundai offers all-wheel drive as an option too. The SUV also gets three drive modes - Eco, Sport, and My Drive - and three terrain modes -  Mud, Snow, Sand. Hybrid setup enhances ride quality and handling Additionally, the Palisade’s hybrid powertrain brings improvements in vehicle dynamics. It enables an electrically-controlled ride comfort system dubbed ‘e-Comfort Drive’, which can reduce vertical movement when the Palisade goes over a speedbreaker and keeps body motion in check during acceleration. Handling is aided via the ‘e-Dynamic Drive’ system, which encompasses three features named e-DTVC (brakes and electric motor apply torque vectoring in steering direction while cornering to reduce understeer), e-EHA (motor maximises grip during sudden steering input to reduce skidding), and e-Handling (torque is dynamically adjusted while cornering to improve traction and stability). Hyundai Palisade exterior design Distinctive and squared-off styling echoes Range Rover The latest-gen Palisade first broke cover in December 2024, and much like prior iterations, it’s a large SUV with imposing design flourishes - albeit with boxier Range Rover-esque proportions this time. Notable styling elements on the new Palisade include a vertically-slatted arrangement for the LED headlights and tail-lamps, wide grille, 21-inch 15-spoke alloy wheels, and silver finish for the body cladding, D-pillars, and roof rails. Hyundai Palisade interior and features Three-row layout, second row captain seats also available Inside, the Palisade comes with a three-row layout that can accommodate up to eight occupants, but for buyers looking to maximise comfort in the middle, Hyundai optionally offers reclinable second-row captain seats with deployable footrests. The dashboard is dominated by a dual-screen setup comprising a 12.3-inch infotainment system and 12.3-inch digital driver’s display, with a three-spoke steering wheel in front of the latter. Fingerprint sensor in centre console can start the engine There are lots of physical controls on the Palisade’s centre console for the media system and HVAC functions, and moving further down reveals a large armrest, sizable storage space, and a wireless charging slot. Interestingly, the Palisade also gets a fingerprint sensor on the centre console that can start the engine and enable valet mode, among other functions. Other goodies included with the Palisade are a rear parking camera cleaning system, digital key, 360-degree camera, panoramic sunroof, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, powered seats with heating and cooling, 14-speaker Bose sound system, vehicle-to-load (V2L) functionality, ADAS suite, built-in dashcam, and more. Hyundai Palisade price in India May fall in the Rs 40-50 lakh range thanks to localisation Once it arrives in India, the Palisade could be priced in the Rs 50 lakh (ex-showroom) ballpark, as we understand that Hyundai is looking to localise the SUV here and export it to other markets. The current US prices for the Palisade start at $36,800 - approximately Rs 31.60 lakh - which lends further credence to the expected price point.
