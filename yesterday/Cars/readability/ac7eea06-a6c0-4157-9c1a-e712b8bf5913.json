  "text": "The most popular version of the Volkswagen Type 2 Microbus arrived more than 50 years ago and quickly became a symbol of peace and good vibes synonymous with the 1970s. Even today, the Type 2 Microbus has a cult following that’s readily apparent in any media involving the 1970s, hippies, or Woodstock.The first-generation Type 2 began production in 1950 with an iconic style that has stood the test of time. At the time, minivans weren’t a thing, and the Type 2 filled that niche with three rows of bench seats and seating for up to nine passengers.The 2025 Volkswagen ID.Buzz makes a somewhat belated entrance if the German automaker’s goal was to appeal to baby boomers who remember the original model as a familiar sight. However, that doesn’t appear to be the case, as the new version features an electric powertrain—an option that hasn’t seen widespread adoption among boomers. That said, its distinctive design and unexpectedly impressive performance figures, definitely set it apart in a way that not many competitors aren't capable of.2025 VW ID.BuzzVWThe Volkswagen ID.Buzz is a little weighty, but still quickThe Volkswagen ID.Buzz is finally making its way to American shores, but it’s not nearly as light as the original Type 2. The all-new model weighs in at 6,174 pounds, more than 3,000 pounds above the iconic Type 2. Not only that, but it even has the Honda Odyssey beat by more than 1,500 pounds.That weight might raise some eyebrows, but Volkswagen planned for that. The ID.Buzz rides on the same platform that underpins VW’s other electric offerings, including the all-electric ID.4. A single electric motor on the rear wheels delivers 282 horsepower, while all-wheel drive models produce 335 horsepower.2025 VW ID.Buzz interiorVWWhile there’s definitely enough performance for the weight, the ID.Buzz faces another major hurdle in terms of its battery. At 86-kWh, it's not exactly competitive in terms of range with a measly 234-mile range that drops to 231 miles in the AWD version.The all-wheel drive ID.Buzz bolts to 60 miles per hour in 5.5 seconds thanks to instant torque that’ll keep passengers pinned to their seats. While that performance might seem fantastic, keep in mind other electric models like the three-row Kia EV9 come in at under five seconds.Then again, performance isn’t the main attraction of the Volkswagen ID.Buzz, is it? The iconic design is unlike anything else on the road, and the interior follows the same unique styling concept.The VW ID.Buzz is true to the original inside and outWith a staggering starting price of $59,995 for the base trim, the 2025 Volkswagen ID.Buzz is far from affordable, but its unique design might make it worth every penny to some. Unlike the original Type 2, the ID.Buzz offers seating for seven, so two passengers will have to be left behind. Opting for second-row captain’s chairs reduces seating to six.Thanks to the battery platform, the interior is essentially a large, flat floor, that makes it ideal for transporting people, animals, and cargo alike. Minimalism is at its peak, with subtle accents placed strategically throughout the cabin. If you were thinking Volkswagen would go over the top in the name of nostalgia, you can breathe a sigh of relief. Whereas the European model is stuck with just two rows of seats, the North American ID.Buzz gains nearly 10 inches to fit the removable third row. The large slanted windshield, oversized VW badge, and sliding side doors are also clear callbacks to the Type 2 of yore.In terms of tech, the 2025 Volkswagen ID.Buzz is still a modern vehicle with a full suite of standard systems. A 12.9-inch touchscreen display, keyless access with proximity unlock, wireless smartphone charging, and eight USB-C ports are just a few of the systems that break the nostalgic image, but for good reason.Volkswagen’s microbus revival faces steep competitionWhile the Volkswagen ID.Buzz is a unique entry into a passenger van segment dominated by minivans, it still has a massive metaphorical hill to climb. Minivans are on a slow downfall and there are plenty of SUVs that can match the seating and performance.2025 VW ID.BuzzVWWhile the ID.Buzz is the only electric minivan on the market, there are a handful of electric SUVs that offer a higher range without the extreme price tag. The Kia EV9, for example, is tens of thousands of dollars cheaper and offers three-row seating. The EV9 offers up to a 310-mile range, absolutely smoking the ID.Buzz’s 234-mile range.The ID.Buzz’s styling options could be its saving graceThe ID.Buzz's performance and range don’t do the price tag justice, so the German automaker had to go all out in the minivan’s customization and style to win over the public.The retro design features a variety of interior and exterior color combinations that allow consumers to create their ideal ID.Buzz, with three extra interior colors being exclusive to the North American market at an additional cost.Dune offers a bright and airy design, Copper compels drivers to hit the open road with a style fit for the 1960s, and Moonlight emphasizes sophistication, with a darker theme throughout the cabin.2025 VW ID.BuzzVWAny of the three interior color options pair nicely with the exterior design. Modernized retro touches, such as the oversized VW logo, short overhangs, and large greenhouse, add charm. But are these features enough to justify the ID.Buzz's price tag?Volkswagen didn’t seem to think so, and rightly so. In keeping with the Type 2’s original message and style, the German automaker partnered with Wrapmate to give buyers the chance to truly customize the all-electric ID.Buzz from the get-go with semi-permanent wraps.Final thoughtsThe ID.Buzz has been available in Europe for some time, but we’re just now getting into the swing of things on American shores. With a price tag upwards of $60,000, is the unique styling and nostalgia of a past generation enough to make it a success? With hybrid minivans, like the Toyota Sienna and Kia Carnival, the ID.Buzz’s status as a cultural icon may remain just that.On the other hand, it clearly isn’t here to push minivan electrification, nor is it out to change the landscape of the automotive industry. Instead, the return of the microbus is a practice of bringing character back to a world where every car, truck, minivan, and SUV follows the same basic set of blueprints.It’s a fun blast from the past that hits all the right notes, and, if this millennial can say so, is downright groovy.",
