  "description": "The 2025 MRF MMSC Indian National Motorcycle Racing Championship (INMRC) kicked off, with Round 1 held at Madras International Circuit. The round saw the introduction of the new Pro-Stock 165-200cc category, running race-prepped TVS Apache GP200R bikes (based on the Apache RTR 200 4V). 11-time national champion Rajini Krishnan also returns for a full season in the INMRC. RACR Castrol Power1’s Rahil Pillarisetty, Petronas TVS Racing’s Sarthak Chavan and Mad Rabbit Racing’s Savion Babu emerged as the big winners at Round 1. However, several races were cancelled on the final day as a thunderstorm caused considerable damage to the facility. Pro-Stock 301-400cc It was a near-photo finish for Race 1. Reigning Pro-Stock 301-400cc champion Chavan passed polesitter Pillarisetty on the very last lap after trailing him throughout the race. Just two-hundreths of a second separated the two as they crossed the finish line. Alwin Sundar finished third in his debut race for TVS. Pillarisetty bounced back the next day, overcoming a strong challenge from Chavan to score his first race win in four years. Chiranth Vishwanath completed the podium in third place.

It’s a spec category, with TVS supplying race-ready versions of its Apache RTR 2004V. The race-spec bike is claimed to deliver a 40 percent power boost over the stock engine and weighs just 105 kg. Other key changes over the road-going bike include adjustable front and rear suspension, lighter racing wheels, an aluminium sub-frame, and an aero kit. 17-year-old Savion Sabu emerged as the first race winner in the category with a dominant lights-to-flag victory ahead of Soorya PM and Mohan Babu.
