  "description": "The Kia Syros made its global debut just last week, but we now have details confirming that the SUV’s all-electric version will come to India in the January to March 2026 quarter. When it arrives, the Kia Syros EV will take on the likes of the Tata Nexon EV and Mahindra’s XUV400. Kia Syros EV to be front-wheel-drive only Shares platform with Hyundai Inster EV While specific details about the Syros EV are scarce, we know that the upcoming all-electric compact SUV will be a front-wheel-drive model and that it shares its K1 platform with the Hyundai Inster EV, which is sold in international markets. The Hyundai is available with 42kWh and 49kWh Nickel Manganese Cobalt battery options, with WLTP-rated ranges of 300km and 355km, respectively.  Other than minor changes to its exterior in the form of highlights, badges and areo-optimised wheels and interior – EV-specific software for the displays and different trims and upholstery – the Syros EV is expected to look the same as its petrol and diesel counterparts. The features list and safety kit are also expected to be the same. Highlights include Level 2 ADAS, a 360-degree camera, a panoramic sunroof, two 12.3-inch displays for infotainment duties and instrumentation, a 5-inch touchscreen for the climate control system and the segment-first reclining, sliding and ventilated second-row seats. Expect prices for the Kia Syros to be in the range of Rs 15 lakh-20 lakh, ex-showroom. As we had reported earlier, Kia estimates that the Syros EV and the upcoming Carens EV are likely to bring in combined volumes of 50,000-60,000 units by 2026.
