  "text": "Forget the Pacifica and roll in style with the upcoming Mercedes VLE and VLS July 2, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier Mercedes has teased the upcoming VLE, which will presumably replace the V-Class. The model rides on the all-new VAN.EA platform and will be offered in North America. The van offers seating for up to eight people and will be followed by a luxurious VLS. Earlier this year, Mercedes announced plans for two new vans called the VLE and VLS. At the time, the company said they would ride on their new van platform and sit at the “top-end of its model portfolio.” Fast forward to today and Mercedes has released the first official pictures of the VLE. It’s expected to replace the V-Class and be a more luxurious version of the next-generation Vito. More: Mercedes Teases Future Electric Vans With VAN.EA Prototypes The company didn’t say much about the van, but the VLE features a fully enclosed grille that is flanked by large headlights. We can also see a wide lower intake as well as a short hood. Elsewhere, there’s a rakish windscreen that flows into a gently sloping roof. Designers also gave the model slab-sided bodywork and flush-mounted door handles. They’re joined by a surprisingly compact greenhouse as the beltline is significantly higher than on the V-Class. There isn’t much to see out back, but the van has a sizable spoiler and vertical taillights, which are temporary placeholders for the production units. The model also has a plain rear bumper and a huge liftgate. While Mercedes isn’t saying much, the automaker confirmed two prototypes traveled 677 miles (1,090 km) from Stuttgart to Rome with only two 15-minute charging stops. The company went on to note this was harder than it sounds as the route included “winding, steep mountain passes through the Alps, long highway stretches, busy rural roads, and tight city streets.” Speaking of the latter, the firm said rear axle steering came in handy as it allowed for greater maneuverability in urban environments. Little is known about the VLE at this point, but the automaker previously said their upcoming vans will ride on the VAN.EA architecture and offer front- and all-wheel drive. They’ll also have 800V technology, a 22 kW AC charger, and the latest version of the Mercedes‑Benz Operating System. We can also expect “well over” 311 miles (500 km) of range as well as a Level 2 semi-autonomous driving system. A Level 3 system is slated to arrive by the end of the decade and make long trips even more relaxing. Despite not revealing much, Mercedes confirmed the VLE will be able to seat up to eight people. The company said this will make it ideal for families as well as use as a VIP shuttle. The VLS, on the other hand, will “define a unique segment of its own that bestows true greatness to automotive luxury.” Marketing hyperbole aside, Mercedes confirmed plans to offer electric midsize vans in Canada, China, and the United States. These will be passenger-focused models known as “Grand Limousines,” instead of commercial vehicles like the Vito.",
