  "text": "This super-rare hypercar has 5,000 miles on it and a multi-million dollar bid, but it failed to meet the reserve December 23, 2024 at 19:45 by Stephen Rivers A rare Pagani Huayra Tempesta just went up for auction online. Despite a bid of over $2.2 million, the car failed to meet the reserve. At the same time, the high bidder still gets to negotiate with the seller. Few cars in the world are as sought after and as special as the Pagani Huayra. Known for its incredible power and craftsmanship, these cars regularly cost millions when new. What us normal folk don’t get to see is exactly what the wealthy pay for them. Today, we got a glimpse of that world as one went up for auction and failed to sell despite a bid of $2,275,000. The Huayra in question is one of 100 coupe versions ever built. It features a 6.0-liter twin-turbocharged V12 from Mercedes-AMG, a seven-speed automated manual gearbox, and around 700 horsepower (521 kW) all sent to the rear wheels. Impressively for a supercar of its ilk, this one has racked up 5,000 miles of real-world use. More: One-Off Pagani Huayra Codalunga Was Built With Help From Hermes On top of that, this one has the Tempesta package. What’s that, you ask? It’s a special group of parts installed by Pagani long after production. According to the Bring a Trailer listing, this 2014 Huayra received the Tempesta package in 2018. It includes a titanium exhaust, Öhlins coilovers, staggered-diameter wheels, a revised front splitter, underbody panels, and a rear diffuser constructed from carbon fiber. It’s all of these special features that led bidders to push the best offer to $2,275,000. In fact, there was a short but significant (and a little funny) bidding war with competitors stacking $1,000 or just a bit more time and time again. Finally, the bidding ended but the reserve wasn’t met. The reality about the end of the auction was clear to many of those involved. While the high bidder didn’t win the car outright, they now have the chance to negotiate exclusively with the seller to see if the two can come to an agreement. On top of that, while they’ll likely pay more to obtain the car if a deal does get made, winning the chance to negotiate effectively costs them nothing.  Photos: Bring a Trailer",
