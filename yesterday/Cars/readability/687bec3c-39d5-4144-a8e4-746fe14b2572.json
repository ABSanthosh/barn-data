  "description": "Several car brands, such as Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors and Hyundai, have confirmed upcoming price hikes for their entire model line-ups. Set to take effect starting April 2025, the price increases are claimed to be a result of rising input costs and operational expenses for the carmakers. Maruti Suzuki and Kia to undertake price hikes of up to 4 percent and 3 percent, respectively Tata Motors has yet to specify the maximum price hike for its models The rise in prices will vary depending on models and their variants Maruti Suzuki price increase in April 2025 Up to 4 percent higher prices Maruti Suzuki usually raises prices by varying degrees across its portfolio, so it remains to be seen which of its models will see the highest 4 percent rise from April, which will be the company’s third price hike this year. In previous instances, prices were increased by up to Rs 32,500 for the Celerio, Brezza, Alto K10, and other models in January and February. Maruti Suzuki hasn’t shared the exact reasons behind its increasing expenditure, but according to our sister publication, Autocar Professional, it may be driven by ballooning raw material costs and supply chain troubles that several automobile manufacturers are currently facing in India. Mahindra price increase in April 2025 Up to 3 percent higher prices Mahindra has announced price hikes of up to 3 percent for its full model line-up, including the Thar, Scorpio N, Bolero, XUV700, and more. The carmaker's commercial vehicle offerings will also be impacted by the upcoming price adjustment, which Mahindra claims is a result of rising input costs and commodity prices. Tata price increase in April 2025 Starting next month, Tata will also undertake price hikes across its full range, depending on the model and variant. The company attributes the price hikes to “rising input costs” but has yet to confirm the extent of the markups. Hyundai price increase in April 2025 Up to 3 percent higher prices Hyundai cars like the Creta, Verna, Venue and Tucson will become costlier by up to 3 percent from April onwards. Rising input costs, increased commodity prices and higher operational expenses were some of the reasons cited by the mass-market car brand for the same.  Kia price increase in April 2025 Up to 3 percent higher prices Kia has confirmed a price hike of up to 3 percent for its entire model line-up in India, which comprises the Seltos, Sonet, Syros, EV6, EV9, Carens and Carnival. The carmaker cites “rising commodity prices” and “escalating supply chain-related costs” as the reasons. BMW price increase in April 2025 Up to 3 percent The prices of BMW and Mini cars will be increased by up to 3 percent effective next month. These include BMW 3 Series LWB, iX1 LWB, M5 and X7 models. The Mini Cooper S and Countryman Electric will also become costlier. Renault price increase in April 2025 Up to 2 percent higher prices All three Renault offerings in India - the Kwid, Kiger, and Triber - will undergo price hikes of up to 2 percent starting next month. According to Renault India CEO and MD Venkatram Mamillapalle, the company has been subsuming rising input costs for \"a considerable time,\" but the sustained increase has now necessitated a price hike for its model portfolio. Honda price increase in April 2025 Honda India's Kunal Behl said that effective April, all models, including the Amaze, City, City e:HEV and Elevate, will see a price increase. “Despite efforts to absorb [rising input costs and operational expenses], some price revision has become unavoidable and will be passed on to customers,” he added.
