Acquired by the seller in November 2024, this GS460 is now offered at no reserve with manufacturer’s literature, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Pennsylvania title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in Matador Red Mica and has HID headlights, fog lights, a sunroof, parking sensors, a rearview camera, a rear spoiler, LED taillights, and power-folding side mirrors with puddle lights. Photos of paint meter readings are shown in the gallery below. The 18″ wheels are wrapped in 245/40 Bridgestone DriveGuard tires. The car is equipped with an Adaptive Variable Suspension system, and braking is provided by four-wheel ventilated discs with Electronic Controlled Braking. The heated, ventilated, and power-adjustable front seats and a rear bench are upholstered in black leather, while Red Walnut wood trim accents the cabin. Amenities include front seat position memory, dual-zone automatic climate control, cruise control, push-button ignition, navigation, and a CD/cassette stereo linked to a Mark Levinson sound system. The wood- and leather-trimmed steering wheel frames a 160-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and supplementary gauges. The digital odometer indicates 43k miles, approximately 500 of which were added under current ownership. The 4.6-liter 1UR-FSE V8 features variable valve timing and was factory rated at 342 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque. Power is delivered to the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission. Additional underside photos are provided in the gallery.
