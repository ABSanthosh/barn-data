Powered by a 5.5-liter V12 paired with a six-speed manual transaxle, the car is finished in Giallo Modena over Nero leather upholstery. Features include a limited-slip differential, 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels, a Tubi-style exhaust system, power-adjustable Daytona-style seats, a CD stereo, and automatic climate control. Work performed in 2022 included replacing the timing belts, drive belts, spark plugs, power steering hoses, and oil delivery lines. This 550 Maranello is offered by the selling dealer with manufacturer’s literature, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Pennsylvania title. The 550 Maranello was styled by Pininfarina, and this example is finished in Giallo Modena. Equipment includes projector-style headlights, fog lights, a hood scoop, a front spoiler, front fender vents, and quad exhaust tips exiting through the rear bumper cover. Previous paintwork is noted on the left fender, front bumper, hood, and quarter panels. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. Silver five-spoke 18″ alloy wheels are mounted with Continental ExtremeContact tires. Braking is handled by red-finished Ferrari-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors at all four corners. The right-front lower control arm bushings were replaced in 2022. The cabin features power-adjustable Daytona-style seats upholstered in black leather with yellow piping. Amenities include a gated shifter, automatic climate control, electric windows, a CD stereo, rear luggage straps, a fire extinguisher, carbon-fiber dashboard and console inserts, and a quilted rear shelf and headliner. The leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel fronts a Jaeger instrument cluster with a 220-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 7,600-rpm redline as well as gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 41k miles. The 5.5-liter quad-cam F133A V12 features 48 valves, dry-sump lubrication, and Bosch Motronic engine management for a factory-rated output of 478 horsepower and 419 lb-ft of torque. A timing belt service was performed by Scuderia Performante in Malvern, Pennsylvania, in July 2022, at which time the camshaft seals, valve cover gaskets, drive belts, timing belt covers, spark plugs, the phase sensor, left intake hose, power steering hoses, and the oil delivery lines were replaced. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. A Tubi-style exhaust system has been added, and the transmission mounts were replaced in 2022. Manufacturer’s literature will accompany the sale. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
