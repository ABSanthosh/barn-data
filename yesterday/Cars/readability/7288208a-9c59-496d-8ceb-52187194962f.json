  "description": "This 1955 Chevrolet 150 two-door sedan underwent a reported 2,000-hour build circa 2015 that included installing a Wegner Motorsports 7.0-liter LS7 V8 and a Bowler 4L60E four-speed automatic. The car rides on a Roadster Shop chassis with tubular control arms up front and adjustable coilovers all around along with a four-link rear setup with a Strange axle housing 4.10:1 gears. The body is finished in metallic silver, and the staggered-diameter Forgeline wheels are mounted over hydroboosted Wilwood multi-piston four-wheel disc brakes. The cabin features a custom center console, carbon-fiber trim, Classic Instruments gauges, an Alpine receiver, JL Audio components, Vintage Air climate control, and power-adjustable front bucket seats trimmed in black leather. Acquired by the seller in 2017, this modified 150 is offered with service records and a clean California title in the seller's name.",

Acquired by the seller in 2017, this modified 150 is offered with service records and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The seller tells us the body was refinished in the Porsche shade of Arctic Silver Metallic during the build, and it is mounted to a Roadster Shop Spec-series chassis. The emblems and trim were shaved, and details include a power-operated trunk lid, a mesh grille, an electrically operated taillight fuel filler door, LED headlights, and chrome bumpers and side spears. Forgeline 18″ front and 20″ rear wheels feature gray spokes and machined accents, and they are mounted with Nitto NT05 tires. The car rides on tubular control arms up front and adjustable AFCO coilovers at all four corners. The hydroboosted disc brake system features six-piston front and four-piston rear Wilwood calipers over slotted and drilled rotors. The power-adjustable front bucket seats and individual rear seats are trimmed in black leather and are joined by a custom full-length center console and door panels along with a microsuede headliner. Appointments include a B\u0026M shifter, carbon-fiber trim, Vintage Air climate control, custom HVAC vents, power windows, and an Alpine touchscreen receiver linked to JL Audio components. The custom steering wheel sits on an Ididit tilting column ahead of a suite of Classic Instruments analog gauges. Carbon-fiber trim accents the dashboard and instrument cluster. The odometer shows 2,900 miles, approximately 1,800 of which were added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown. The seller tells us the 7.0-liter LS7 V8 was assembled by Wegner Motorsports and installed in 2015, and it is cooled by a cross-flow aluminum radiator and dual electric fans. It is also equipped with a polished intake pipe and a custom engine cover. An Optima yellow-top battery was fitted in May 2025, the spark plug wires were replaced in October 2024, the car was dyno-tuned in 2023, and work in 2022 included installing a custom battery tray and a replacement ignition switch. The 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission was assembled by Bowler Transmissions, according to the seller. The custom Strange Engineering rear axle is equipped with a limited-slip differential and 4.10:1 gears. Four-into-one headers flow to a stainless-steel exhaust system with MagnaFlow mufflers. The vehicle is titled in California under the VIN A55N036531, which aligns with the VIN on the tag displayed above. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
