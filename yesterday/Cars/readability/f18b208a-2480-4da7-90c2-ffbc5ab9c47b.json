  "text": "A concept could debut in Munich and be based on the Porsche 718 Electric July 25, 2025 at 21:01 by Michael Gauthier Audi is gearing up to introduce an electrifying new concept this fall. It’s being billed as a TT Moment 2.0, although the model won’t be a new TT. Instead, the car will be larger and likely based on the Porsche 718 Electric. The Audi TT went out of production in 2023 and we’ve heard countless rumors about its return. Spy photographers have even snapped a possible mule based on the upcoming Porsche 718 Electric. While the model was believed to be a ways off, Audi CEO Gernot Döllner recently revealed a new car is coming and it will be their TT Moment 2.0. Speaking to Bild, Döllner said the electric concept will debut this fall and that likely means an unveiling during the Munich Motor Show. More: This Porsche 718 Could Be Hiding Audi’s Next TT Little is known about the “identity builder,” but an image of the car suggests it will be larger than the TT. In fact, it looks more like a shrunken down version of the A5 Coupe/Convertible. This kind of makes sense as Motor1 noted Döllner said it would be “something in between” a TT and R8. SHProshots That certainly sounds like a new model based on the Porsche 718 Electric and the car is slated to go into production in the next two years. If everything turns out as expected, the TT successor could be considerably sportier and offered with an available dual-motor all-wheel drive system. Details are hazy, but the 718 Electric has been plagued by problems and reports have suggested the car has been pushed back to 2027 due to battery issues. That could be a big problem as Porsche has already confirmed the current 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman will go out of production this October.",
