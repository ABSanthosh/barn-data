  "text": "There's certainly no mistaking this Audi Q8 from any other on the roads, that's for sure 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson This custom Audi Q8’s 30-inch wheels required major modifications, including relocating sensors and welding suspension arms for fitment. Despite the massive wheel upgrade, Coast to Coast Customs managed to retain the Q8’s adaptive air suspension for a smoother ride. Coast to Coast Customs in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was recently approached by an Audi Q8owner with a unique request. The owner already had 26-inch wheels on their SUV but wanted something even more flamboyant. The specialists shop responded by designing a set of custom 30-inch wheels specifically for the Q8. According to the tuner, despite the dramatic size increase, the SUV still drives comparably to a standard model. The wheels in question have been sourced from Forgiato and, in true Florida fashion, are finished in chrome. While many people (rightfully so) think chrome wheels went out of vogue decades ago, they clearly still appeal to some. These flashy rims have a tightly-spoked design, deep dishes, and floating center caps and transform the overall look of the Audi. Review: The Audi Q8 60 TFSI E Quattro Is A Flagship Plug-In Hybrid However, getting wheels of this size onto an Audi Q8 isn’t a simple case of just swapping out the old for the new. There’s a lot more going on beneath the surface. Coast to Coast Customs had to make some serious modifications to ensure the wheels would fit and function properly. For starters, sensors had to be relocated, the intercooler shifted, and the aluminum suspension arms were cut and welded to accommodate the size. It wasn’t just about making them fit physically; the team also had to make sure the massive wheels wouldn’t hinder the SUV’s ability to steer. Despite these substantial changes, Coast to Coast managed to retain the Audi’s adaptive air suspension. Adding wheels as big as this can utterly ruin the way a vehicle drives, and while the shop has done what it can to make things smooth, we suspect it still drives a little differently from how it did when it was new and sitting on the original rims. Let’s be real—when you go this big, sacrifices are inevitable. The larger the wheels, the more glaring those compromises become, whether it’s in handling, ride comfort, or fuel economy. But for some people, the idea of cruising around in a Q8 that fades into traffic just isn’t an option.",
