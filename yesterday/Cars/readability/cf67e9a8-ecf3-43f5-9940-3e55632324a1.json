  "text": "28 units are slated to be built and they could cost more than $1 million March 13, 2025 at 20:20 by Michael Gauthier Lynx has announced plans for a street-legal hypercar based on the first-generation Ford GT. The models are slated to have a supercharged V8 that produces more than 1,200 hp. A brochure on their website had conflicting information and a $1.7 million price tag. Lynx Motors and Graham Rahal Performance have announced plans to offer a street-legal version of the Ford Matech Concepts GT1 Le Mans race car. The back story is a tad complicated, but Matech Concepts went bust and Lynx acquired their assets, and are now transforming first-generation chassis into an eye-catching hypercar. Lynx didn’t say much of substance, but implied the road-going GT1 will have a wider stance, a carbon fiber body, and aerodynamic enhancements. Judging by the pictures, we can expect a prominent front splitter, canards, and a sizable rear wing. More: Lynx Motors Brings DeLorean And Ford GT Back From The Future With An Electric Twist Less is known about the interior, but a rendering shows an updated cabin with a new steering wheel and what appears to be a wireless smartphone charger. We can also see two-tone upholstery as well as carbon fiber trim. That’s not much to go on, but 28 units are slated to be produced in Zionsville, Indiana by Graham Rahal Performance. Each is slated to have a six-speed manual transmission from Ricardo as well as a supercharged V8 producing more than 1,200 hp (895 kW / 1,217 PS). While the GT1 sounds interesting, Lynx’s website confusingly mentions Gulf and Eau Rouge variants. These appear to be part of an earlier plan as a brochure says the $1,700,000 Gulf was slated to have a  twin-turbo V8 producing more than 1,200 hp (895 kW / 1,217 PS). The Gulf was also slated to spawn two track-only variants, featuring a Roush engine developing 1,500 hp (1,119 kW / 1,521 PS). The Eau Rouge, on the other hand, was claimed to have 1,400 hp (1,044 kW / 1,419 PS).",
