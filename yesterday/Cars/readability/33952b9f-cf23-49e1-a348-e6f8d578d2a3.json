  "description": "Porsche and Audi India have issued a recall for the Taycan and the e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT, respectively, over a potential defect in the battery module that could cause a fire hazard. As per SIAM, a total of 207 cars were affected, which included 176 Taycans and 31 units of either the e-tron GT or RS e-tron GT. 39 units of both models had been previously recalled for the same issue A total of 207 units have been affected this time SIAM noted that the affected units of the Porsche Taycan were manufactured between October 21, 2019 and March 4, 2024. For the Audi e-tron GT pair, affected units were manufactured between January 1, 2020 and February 16, 2024. The recall, officially issued in November, stated that under certain circumstances, there is a possibility that the battery cell modules may have certain technical irregularities from the time of production. This could lead to a rise in temperature and, ultimately, fire in the high-performance EVs as a result of a short circuit within the battery module. Incidentally, both cars are sibling models and share a 93kWh battery pack. Earlier, recalls for select ICE models like the Porsche 911 (992) and Audi Q7 were announced due to mechanical issues. Ex-showroom prices of the Porsche Taycan start at Rs 1.89 crore, while the Audi e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT cost Rs 1.71 and Rs 1.95 crore, respectively. Both brands are run under the Skoda Auto Volkswagen India Private Limited division here. There has been no official communication from either Porsche or Audi yet, but both brands are expected to reach out to the owners of the affected units to schedule an appointment and fix the issue free of cost.
