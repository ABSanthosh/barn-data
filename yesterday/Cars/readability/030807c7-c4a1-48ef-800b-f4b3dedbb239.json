  "description": "Engage “Rock” mode, shift to neutral, engage low range, shift to drive, hit the G-Turn button, select the direction of rotation using the paddles, ensure the steering is dead straight, flex your right foot and be prepared to get ‘shocked’ as the almost 3.1-tonneSUV spins around like a ballet dancer. In fact, that’s also how the electric G-Class was introduced to the world. Dubbed as the EQG in concept guise, the Mercedes-Benz G 580 with EQ Technology –yes, that’s its full name – is the G-Class for the silent, and hopefully pollution-free future. With an aim to retain all of its iconic elements while packing in the latest EV tech under the skin, the green plate G-Class has the glitz and glamour you expect of a Gelandewagen. But what about its character that is rooted in guns and glory? Can it withstand an apocalypse? Mercedes G Class Electric off-road ability To find out if it is all show and no go, taking it off-road is the best litmus test. Learn Off-road near Mumbai is the ideal venue not only because of its controlled environment, but it also has obstacles that will truly challenge the might of the G. I started by checking the lean angle on the side slope. As the car leaned over, I could see the world from an acute angle, with the only reassurance being the claimed ability to take on inclined angles as steep as 35 degrees, equivalent to a 70 percent gradient. With my eyes locked in on the spotter, I, thankfully, made it out without tipping over. Next up was a test of the dramatic wheel articulation. Like the ICE version, the G 580 also features independent front suspension and a rigid axle at the rear. However, there are no diff locks.In its place are what Mercedes calls “Virtual Diffs”, which are motors that can operate individually for each wheel. Also, with the motors spinning at high speeds, the low-range gear in each of them multiplies the torque in low-speed applications to avoid overheating.         View this post on Instagram                       A post shared by Autocar India (@autocar_india) As the front right wheel enters a gorge, the rear left wheel crunches to offer all the support. Slowly inching ahead, the weight transfer rocks you and makes you nervous about the battery pack stowed beneath the car. The battery is split into two – with a cooling layer sandwiched in between – andhas been integrated into the modified ladder frame. This ensures a low centre of gravity and also helps make it rigid. For protection, however, there is a thick 57kg carbon composite case, which is about 150kg lighter than an equivalent steel plate of the same thickness. Mercedes engineers have done vigorous tests to ensure there is no room for punctures and leaks, and that the plate can withstand six times the weight of the car. That’s saying something. It is also torsion-resistant, so any form of flex won’t be an issue.The whole casing is also waterproof, allowing for up to 850mm water wading – 150mm more than the ICE version. Plenty of relevant off-road telemetry to geek out on. But the highlights were the off-road features exclusive to the electric G that you don’t get on the ICE version. First was the intelligent off-road crawl, which is essentially cruise control for steep climbs and drops with the electronics managing that four-figure torque and ensuring there is no wheel slip. The crawl is activated as soon as you engage low range,and with three levels of set speed, you need not modulate throttle and brake continuously. Of course, you can override the system by simply tapping on the brake or accelerator. What also helps climb slopes is the transparent bonnet that gives you a view of what’s under the car. This allows you to focus on your line and is one less thing to worry about when you can barely see out the windshield. The electric G also has better approach and departure angles compared to the G 63 due to the reprofiled bumpers and high ground clearance, but the battery pack positioned under the car means the breakover angle is not as good as the AMG. Then there is the G-Steering, which reduces the turning circle and makes tight turns a breeze. Engage rock mode and select G-steering and the car will lock the inside rear wheel to pivot around itself, thereby shortening the turning radius. It remains engaged for speeds upto 25kph, and you need to apply full-lock to the steering to stall that inner rear wheel. Transparent bonnet helps when the spotter doesn’t. However, the most talked about feature by far is the G-Turn,with its 8-step engaging procedure I explained in the beginning. Sure, it may seem like a gimmick and is huge fun, but it is useful if you are stuck in muck and need to clear out some area around you. Also, while the system spins the car around twice, you can stop it at whichever position you want by just letting go of the paddleshifter. After spending half a day bashing the G over multiple obstacles, it was clear that if you want the more capable G, the 580 EQ is the top choice. Mercedes G Class Electric performance Now, it’s clearly better off-road, but does that also hold true on tarmac? To begin with, there is a faint electric buzz around it – Mercedes calls it the ‘Aura’ of the G 580 – presumably to warn pedestrians that a 3.1-tonne monster is creeping up behind. There is also the G-Roar, which mimics – or at least tries to –the V8’s notes. The effort is commendable and definitely better than some sci-fi spaceship sound, but it needs to be more pronounced and not sound like the V8 is growling with a tape over its mouth. Performance though, is brisk. With 587hp and 1,164Nm, this G is fast enough to wear an AMG badge. For its 3,085kg kerb weight, you expect it to have the athleticism of a hippopotamus, but the motors, powered by a 116kWh battery, put out 587hp and a colossal 1,164Nm of torque that ensure rapid responses. Off the line, the G 580 squats and shoots off to 100kph in just 5.05 seconds. Kickdown times for 20-80kph and 40-100kph are also impressive. Then there are drive modes that alter its character; Comfort offering slightly more laidback reactions in comparison to the immediacy of Sport mode. Still, there is enough poke for it to even wear an AMG badge, and wear it with pride. Individual mode allows you to customise the performance of the steering, motor and even the adaptive dampers in the suspension. Mercedes G Class Electric ride and handling Not the comfiest highway cruiser, but it oozes charm and street cred. With huge 20-inch wheels, and a lot of the weightlower down, a firm ride is inevitable. However, the adaptive dampers do a very good job of muting the harsh thuds, and while you do rock about a fair bit, there is an inherent toughness and the ability to carry more speed over a rough section. On the highway, while the insulation is good, there is a fair bit of road noise from the big tyres. You would also have to be delusional to expect delicate handlingaround corners. You have to chuck the big boy into a corner and hold on as all the principles of mechanics try to wash it into understeer. Grip levels are good, and with moderate pace the steering is light, too, but a fun handler it’s not. Mercedes G Class Electric range, battery and charging Clever packaging of battery between the ladder frame chassis. This wasn’t a full-blown Autocar range test given the focus on off-roading, but we started the drive from our office in Mumbai with 100 percent charge and 416-443km indicated range. After a whole day out and driving 245km,the battery SOC stated that there was 27 percent charge left and a range of 110-122km. That gives an efficiency of 2.89km/kWh and a range of 336km. Sure, you won’t be off-roading and doing multiple G-turns every day so expect that number to be around the 350-375km mark. The 400V architecture allows for upto 200kW DC charging that takes just 32 minutes to go from 10-80 percent, while the 11kW AC charger will top it up from 0-100 percent in 12.5 hours. But range is not the highest priority for a G-Class customer. It’s all the fun mentioned before this section.

The dual 12.3-inch screens now get MBUX functionality, which means, like the G 63, the G 580 also gets a slick and responsive touchscreen. Packed with tech information, the UI is very easy to use and works efficiently. The other great bit are physical switches for the HVAC and media controls and the new off-road buttons in place of the iconic diff-lock switches. Plenty of space for three adults; flat floor a bonus. The seats are well-sized but the cushioning is a bit firm. However, it still packs in luxuries like the massage and ventilation options. There is a standard-sized sunroof too. However, since this is the Edition One, there is subtle use of blue all around. The stitching in the seats, the weave between the carbon-fibre panels on the centre console and even on the steering wheel. 620-litre boot is massive by EV standards. No frunk though. In the back, the high ground clearance means you need to jump inside, which is going to be tricky without any grab rail. But once you’re in, space is not going to be a complaint. The seats though aren’t the best for the money, and while a flat floor, rear vents and three-zone climate control make it comfy for three adults, the seat to be in is behind the steering wheel. There is no frunk under the bonnet and you instead get a sizeable 620-litre boot, which is 20 litres less than the G 63, but it’s hardly noticeable. A slightly raised boot floor is where it lost those extra few litres. Still, hugely impressive by electric standards. Mercedes G Class Electric exterior Now, although the G 580 does away with an engine and exhaust, it still carries the same iconic design that makes everyone take notice. Especially in this exclusive shade of blue, dubbed MANUFAKTUR South Sea Blue Magno. 20-inch wheels are huge but a bit too subtle. If you see it whiz past your window, you won’t be able to tell if it is the electric version –the changes are far too subtle. Get a micrometre and a magnifying glass and you'll notice a swelled-up bonnet, a new A-pillar design, bumpers with different air intakes, air curtains in the rear wheel-arch flare, and, of course, a green number plate. Everything else is classic G. The round headlamps, chunky indicators and upright windshield retain the OG look. But you do miss out on the more closed-off grille with DRL surrounds like the international version. Over to the side, the only missing bit are the exhausts poking out, like you have on the AMG. The length and wheelbase are the same and the ground clearance, at 250mm, is more than the G 63. The blacked-out 20-inch wheels are big but look unassuming, and a close look reveals the brake calipers sport the same blue shade as the exterior. Getting inside almost equivalent to practicing for 100m hurdles. Some expected the rear to look different, courtesy of the boxy charging case seen on the global version. But for India, the G 580 will not get that option and a very handy spare wheel will reign supreme. Mercedes G Class Electric price and verdict At Rs 3 crore (ex-showroom, India), the G 580 is almost Rs 65 lakh cheaper than the G 63, and it does everything that the AMG does and then some. It looks the part, gets you all the cred and is unbelievably capable. Yes, you do feel the absence of the brutish V8 and its hysteria, but that is a small price to pay. In a future that did not look kind to icons like the G-Class, the G 580 is over three tonnes of proof that as long as the three-pointed star lives on, the G will live on.

Of course, you can override the system by simply tapping on the brake or accelerator.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat also helps climb slopes is the transparent bonnet that gives you a view of what’s under the car. This allows you to focus on your line and is one less thing to worry about when you can barely see out the windshield. The electric G also has better approach and departure angles compared to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/2025-mercedes-amg-g-63-facelift-review-madcap-machine-434370\" title=\"2025 Mercedes AMG G 63 facelift review: Madcap machine\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eG 63\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e due to the reprofiled bumpers and high ground clearance, but the battery pack positioned under the car means the breakover angle is not as good as the AMG.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there is the G-Steering, which reduces the turning circle and makes tight turns a breeze. Engage rock mode and select G-steering and the car will lock the inside rear wheel to pivot around itself, thereby shortening the turning radius.

Sure, it may seem like a gimmick and is huge fun, but it is useful if you are stuck in muck and need to clear out some area around you. Also, while the system spins the car around twice, you can stop it at whichever position you want by just letting go of the paddleshifter. After spending half a day bashing the G over multiple obstacles, it was clear that if you want the more capable G, the 580 EQ is the top choice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMercedes G Class Electric performance\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, it’s clearly better off-road, but does that also hold true on tarmac? To begin with, there is a faint electric buzz around it – Mercedes calls it the ‘Aura’ of the G 580 – presumably to warn pedestrians that a 3.1-tonne monster is creeping up behind. There is also the G-Roar, which mimics – or at least tries to –the V8’s notes. The effort is commendable and definitely better than some sci-fi spaceship sound, but it needs to be more pronounced and not sound like the V8 is growling with a tape over its mouth. Performance though, is brisk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mercedes G Class Electric G 580 front tracking\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Mercedes-Benz_G580_Front_Quarter_Tracking.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"Mercedes G Class Electric G 580 front tracking\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWith 587hp and 1,164Nm, this G is fast enough to wear an AMG badge.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor its 3,085kg kerb weight, you expect it to have the athleticism of a hippopotamus, but the motors, powered by a 116kWh battery, put out 587hp and a colossal 1,164Nm of torque that ensure rapid responses. Off the line, the G 580 squats and shoots off to 100kph in just 5.05 seconds. Kickdown times for 20-80kph and 40-100kph are also impressive. Then there are drive modes that alter its character; Comfort offering slightly more laidback reactions in comparison to the immediacy of Sport mode. Still, there is enough poke for it to even wear an AMG badge, and wear it with pride.

However, the adaptive dampers do a very good job of muting the harsh thuds, and while you do rock about a fair bit, there is an inherent toughness and the ability to carry more speed over a rough section. On the highway, while the insulation is good, there is a fair bit of road noise from the big tyres. You would also have to be delusional to expect delicate handlingaround corners. You have to chuck the big boy into a corner and hold on as all the principles of mechanics try to wash it into understeer.

After a whole day out and driving 245km,the battery SOC stated that there was 27 percent charge left and a range of 110-122km. That gives an efficiency of 2.89km/kWh and a range of 336km. Sure, you won’t be off-roading and doing multiple G-turns every day so expect that number to be around the 350-375km mark. The 400V architecture allows for upto 200kW DC charging that takes just 32 minutes to go from 10-80 percent, while the 11kW AC charger will top it up from 0-100 percent in 12.5 hours.

There is no frunk under the bonnet and you instead get a sizeable 620-litre boot, which is 20 litres less than the G 63, but it’s hardly noticeable.
