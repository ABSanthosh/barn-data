  "text": "The new Vantage S has more power, more aero, and promises even more precise handling July 8, 2025 at 20:55 by Brad Anderson The latest Aston Martin pumps out 671 hp and hits 60 mph in just 3.3 seconds. Significant alterations have been made to the car’s suspension and chassis. Several unique touches to the exterior and interior make the Vantage S stand out. Long gone are the days when the Aston Martin Vantage was a sporty and relatively mild cruiser. Some eighteen months after the British marque morphed the Vantage into a legitimate front-engined supercar, it has released an even more potent version, known as the Vantage S. Presented in the lead-up to the Goodwood Festival of Speed, the Vantage S has been improved in all areas. First is the power. The 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 has been refined to deliver 671 hp, a slight increase from the 656 hp of the standard model. Torque remains unchanged at 590 lb-ft (800 Nm). Power continues to be transmitted to the rear wheels through an eight-speed ZF automatic transmission, enabling the Vantage S to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (96 km/h) in 3.3 seconds, 0.1 seconds quicker than the standard model. The sprint to 124 mph (200 km/h) takes just 10.1 seconds, and the car tops out at 202 mph (325 km/h). Read: 2025 Aston Martin Vantage Drops Its Top And Keeps 656 HP Engineers have also ensured the Vantage S handles even better than the standard model. Changes have been made to the Bilstein DTX adaptive dampers to improve front-end feel and response. Additionally, alterations made to the rear springs help improve compression and rebound, boosting low-speed ride quality. The transmission mount is also 10 percent softer, improving refinement. Elsewhere, the rear subframe has been mounted directly to the car’s body without the use of rubber bushes, in a change that promises to boost directness and steering connection. Tweaks have then been made to the camber, toe, and caster settings for an even sportier driving experience. Other Upgrades Aston Martin has avoided the trick of adorning this more potent model with ugly aerodynamic appendages, ensuring the Vantage S looks just as good as the base model, albeit slightly more aggressive. Key changes include centrally mounted blades on the hood, red accents, and a large decklid spoiler at the rear, which adds 44 kg (97 lbs) of downforce. A new set of 21-inch wheels finished in satin black with red trimmings have also been designed for the S. A selection of upgrades have also been made in the cabin. This includes model-specific embroidery and the option of red or silver finishes for the knurled metal drive mode selector.   Market-specific pricing details have not yet been announced. Aston Martin will start deliveries of the Vantage S in the fourth quarter.",
