Indicating 21k kilometers (~13k miles), the car is powered by a 5.6-liter V12 linked to a six-speed manual transmission and is finished in Sterling Silver Metallic over black leather upholstery. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, 17″ Style 21 “throwing star” wheels, a power-operated sunroof, power-adjustable sport seats, a CD stereo, dual-zone automatic climate control, and cruise control. This E31 is offered at no reserve by the seller on behalf of the current owner, a New Jersey retail dealer, with manufacturer’s literature, French-language service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title. The 850CSi featured revised front and rear valances as well as a lowered ride height compared to other E31 coupes. This example is finished in Sterling Silver Metallic (244) and features pop-up headlights, a power-operated sunroof, and black bodyside trim. The seller notes evidence of paintwork on the right side body panels, and paintless dent repair was performed in preparation for the sale. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. Forged-aluminum 17″ BMW Style 21 wheels wear directional “throwing star” covers and are mounted with Michelin Primacy and Leao Nova Force Acro tires, the latter of which were fitted in 2023. Braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated discs with ABS, and the 850CSi features a sport-tuned suspension and revised steering ratios in comparison to other E31 models. The front and rear brake components were replaced in 2022. The cabin features power-adjustable front seats trimmed in black leather along with matching door panels and carpets. Equipment includes an onboard computer, dual-zone automatic climate control, a CD stereo, driver position memory, and a power-adjustable steering column. The onboard computer screen and headliner were repaired in 2024. The four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a 300-km/h speedometer, a tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 21k kilometers (~13k miles), approximately 500 of which were added under current ownership. The 5.6-liter S70B56 V12 was factory-rated at 372 horsepower and 402 lb-ft of torque. Service performed in 2022 is detailed in French-language records presented in the image gallery and involved replacing the clutch master and release cylinders in addition to the fuel pump, fuel lines, batteries, and drive belt. The fluids were also changed. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential.
