  "text": "A would-be thief discovered at least one thing the Corvette Z06 isn't very good at June 25, 2025 at 21:11 by Stephen Rivers Alleged Corvette thief got stuck on a windowsill during a botched dealership escape attempt. Photos show the Z06 hanging halfway out a broken window with its front wheels in the air. Police arrested the suspect moments after the crash and before any real getaway could happen. The Chevrolet Corvette has many great attributes. It’s wildly fast, is not prohibitively expensive (for what it is), and has enough storage space for daily use. Higher-strung variants are even more capable. One suspected car thief found a limit for the Z06, though: evidently, it can’t get over a metal window sill, and that failure led police straight to their suspect. It appears as though the perpetrator gained access to the building by using an e-scooter to smash a window. Once inside, they found the keys to the Corvette, though it’s unclear if they were in the car already or somewhere else. At that stage, it appears that they simply thought they could drive it out of the window the same way one might see in a movie.

The car made it just a few feet before the metal window sill stopped it in its tracks. Once the front wheels crossed over, it looked like the car just couldn’t make it any farther. In addition to the TikTok clip from user @alexhoisnap below, there’s also a video on YouTube from PMTLA. It can’t be embedded, but you can check it out over here. @alexchoisnap #alexchoi #corvette #chevy #car #crash #fyp #fypシ ♬ Mode Silence – Muet, Mode Silencieux, Calme, Chut Pour Iphone – Sonnerie Silencieux The Z06 in question has an asking price of $165,240 and includes the Z06 Ultimate Performance Package, visible carbon fiber aero pieces, carbon fiber interior trim, and the front axle lifting system. Would the criminal have managed to escape had they used that? Probably not, but it would’ve been interesting to see them try. How much will this Z06 be worth now? No telling, but it’s already got a lot of history before ever having a first owner. In any case, it appears that they’re already in custody. Corvette Blogger reports that USC public safety employees nabbed the suspect before police arrived. At that point, they handed him over. Let this be a lesson to all: the ‘Vette is meant to stick firmly to the tarmac, unless it explicitly isn’t.  Photos Felix Chevrolet",
