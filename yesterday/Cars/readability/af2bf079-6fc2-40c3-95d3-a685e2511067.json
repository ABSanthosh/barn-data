The car is finished in Rosso Corsa over Beige leather and is equipped with a five-speed manual transaxle, a limited-slip differential, fog lights, center-lock 15″ five-spoke alloy wheels, and a gated shifter. This 512 BBi was acquired by the current owner in 2004 and is now offered on dealer consignment with a tool kit, spare parts, and a clean California title. The Berlinetta Boxer model was styled by Pininfarina’s Leonardo Fioravanti and was introduced at the 1971 Turin Auto Show. The car features a steel-paneled cabin section paired with a tubular chassis. Aluminum is incorporated for the front and rear clamshells and door panels, while the lower panels are fiberglass. The 512 BBi variant was introduced at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1981. The cars were not officially offered in the US and were imported and federalized in-period via the gray market. This example is finished in Rosso Corsa and features pop-up headlights, fog lights, a front spoiler, NACA side ducts, and dual exhaust outlets. Center-lock 15″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with 240/55 Michelin TRX tires that require replacement. The 512 BBi features a fully independent suspension with unequal-length double wishbones, coilovers up front, a double coilover setup out back, and anti-roll bars fore and aft. Stopping power is provided by ventilated discs at all four corners. The cabin features seating surfaces upholstered in beige leather, along with a color-coordinated center console and door panels. Amenities include a gated dogleg shifter and power windows. Pioneer speakers are fitted in the doors, though the cassette radio and graphic equalizer have been removed and accompany the vehicle.  The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames Veglia instrumentation including a 200-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline as well as auxiliary gauges that extend to the center of the dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows 18k miles. The 4.9-liter F110A flat-12 features Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection utilizing twin CIS fuel distributors and was fitted with twin Turbonetics turbochargers around 2000. The car is due for a timing belt service. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The Carfax report lists no accidents or other damage. The car last passed a California emissions test in 2022, however the turbochargers are not CARB-compliant.  You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
