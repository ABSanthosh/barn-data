The left-hand-drive car rides on 15″ Halibrand-style wheels, and additional appointments include Wilwood brakes, a Holley four-barrel carburetor, and an aluminum radiator with electric cooling fans. This Superformance GT40 was sold on BaT in February 2024 and is now offered by the selling dealer in New York with build photos, an order sheet, a Shelby American Certificate of Origin, and a clean Florida title listing the car as a 1966 Shely. Superformance and Shelby American offered the 50th Anniversary Edition in three different liveries utilized by Ford during the 1966 racing season. This example honors the #1046 Ford GT40 driven to victory by Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and features black-finished fiberglass bodywork with silver stripes and painted white #2 roundels along with covered headlights and fog lights, racing-style fuel-filler caps, quick-jack front bumperettes, NACA ducts on the front fenders, plexiglass side windows with pop-out vents, a ducktail spoiler, and rear clamshell air intakes. An uninstalled Gurney bubble will accompany the sale. Gold-finished 15″ Halibrand-style wheels are secured via three-eared knock-off hubs and mounted with Hoosier tires measuring 25.5×8.0″ up front and 26.5×11.0″ out back. The tubular steel frame is finished in black and features fully independent suspension with coilovers at all four corners. Stopping power is provided by Wilwood four-wheel disc brakes. The left-hand-drive cockpit houses fixed-back racing seats trimmed in black leather with ventilation grommets and Willans harnesses. Carroll Shelby-branded covers adorn the sills, while 50th Anniversary floor mats line the footwells. The air conditioning controls and a 12-volt outlet are located on the driver’s door. The air conditioning was evacuated and recharged in June 2024. The Moto-Lita leather-wrapped steering wheel is mounted on a quick-release hub and sits ahead of Smiths instrumentation that includes a central tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline, a 200-mph speedometer, and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 111 miles. The 496ci V8 was installed by Shelby American of Las Vegas, Nevada, and features an aluminum block, a Holley four-barrel carburetor, Mahle pistons, a dual-plane intake manifold, an MSD high-output distributor, and finned valve covers. Carroll Shelby Engine Co. quoted output at 600 horsepower and 600 lb-ft of torque when new. Dual electric fans draw air through the front-mounted aluminum radiator, and coated “bundle of snakes” headers flow into dual central exhaust outlets with polished finishers. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Quaife five-speed manual transaxle. A GT40 race-type dual clutch kit was fitted in June 2024, at which time the rear frame was repaired and repainted and rear engine support struts were installed.
