  "description": "It appears that after Bajaj rescued KTM last month, things are finally going in the right direction for the fabled but troubled Austrian marque. The court has confirmed the restructuring plans for KTM AG and the other affected companies, and slowly but surely, things are returning to normal for KTM.  KTM Duke, RC, Adventure and dirt bikes’ production to restart soon Bajaj is now a majority owner in KTM KTM production to restart in Austria come late July KTM has a long road to recovery, with Bajaj at its helm now KTM went into self-administration late last year, and this step marks a turnaround point for the company. Since the court has cleared KTM from its restructuring process, the company is now gearing up to resume production of motorcycles, spare parts, accessories and apparel at all its production facilities.  Gottfried Neumeister, the new CEO of KTM’s holding company Pierer Mobility AG, said, “I am relieved and grateful that we have finally been able to close this difficult chapter. Our focus is now on ramping up production at the end of July and realigning the group.” In the coming months, Bajaj will move to being a majority owner in KTM. While this fabled brand will continue to exist, it is fair to state that KTM will still have a long road to recovery and that we are likely to see tectonic changes to the way it operates.
