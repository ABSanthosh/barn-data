  "description": "This 1971 Mercedes-Benz 280SL was initially delivered to Stahl Motor Company in Monterey, California, and was acquired by the current owner in 1996. The car was refinished in white and equipped with a replacement brown soft top in 2010, and the replacement 2.8-liter inline-six was resealed at that time. Shifting is through a four-speed automatic transmission. Equipment includes a removable hardtop, 14\" wheels, power steering, a Becker Europa radio, and Cognac MB-Tex upholstery. In preparation for the sale, the brake pads and spark plugs were replaced. This W113 SL is now offered at no reserve in California on dealer consignment with a window sticker, a tool roll, manufacturer's literature, service records, and a Montana title.",

The car was refinished in white and equipped with a replacement brown soft top in 2010, and the replacement 2.8-liter inline-six was resealed at that time. Shifting is through a four-speed automatic transmission. Equipment includes a removable hardtop, 14″ wheels, power steering, a Becker Europa radio, and Cognac MB-Tex upholstery. In preparation for the sale, the brake pads and spark plugs were replaced. This W113 SL is now offered at no reserve in California on dealer consignment with a window sticker, a tool roll, manufacturer’s literature, service records, and a Montana title. The W113 SL was designed by Friedrich Geiger, Béla Barényi, and Paul Bracq and was introduced to the public at the 1963 Geneva Motor Show. This example left the factory finished in white (050), and it was repainted and fitted with a replacement brown soft top in 2010. Work in 2006 involved repairing the left door. The removable hardtop has chromium roof bars and a luggage rack. Steel 14″ wheels feature covers with painted centers and were fitted with 185-series Michelin MXV tires in preparation for the sale. Additional work included replacing the brake pads, the rear brake hoses, and the brake fluid. The car is equipped with power steering. The cabin houses bucket seats upholstered in Cognac MB-Tex that extends to the door panels. Interior appointments include a Becker Europa AM/FM radio, an analog clock, and a floor-mounted gear shifter. The heater does not work. Interior wear and burn marks near the shifter are depicted in the gallery. The door pocket was repaired in preparation for the sale. The two-spoke steering wheel features a chrome horn ring and frames a 140-mph speedometer and an inoperative tachometer as well as gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer has rolled over and now shows 80k miles. Approximately 100k miles have been added under current ownership. The replacement 2.8-liter M130 inline-six is equipped with Bosch fuel injection and was installed in the early 1980s and resealed in 2010, while the spark plugs were replaced in preparation for the sale. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Stahl Motor Company of Monterey, California, along with equipment, options, and a total price of $8,943. Manufacturer’s literature, a data card, and service records will also accompany the car. The VIN listed on the Montana title is “280SL021796”, which combines the model and the last six digits of the vehicle number shown on the tag above. You are not connected to real-time updates.
