  "description": "This 2014 Pagani Huayra is #78 of 100 coupes built between 2011 and 2018 and is a US-specification example that was delivered new to British Motor Car Distributors in San Francisco, California. It was purchased by the current owner in 2017 and is said to have been returned to Pagani in 2018 for fitment of the Tempesta package, which added a titanium exhaust system, Öhlins coilovers, staggered-diameter wheels, and a revised front splitter, underbody panels, and rear diffuser constructed from carbon fiber. Featuring a carbon-titanium monocoque wrapped in silver-painted carbon-fiber bodywork, the car is powered by a 6.0-liter Mercedes-AMG M158 V12 that features twin turbochargers and dry-sump lubrication. Additional features include an Xtrac transverse seven-speed automated manual transaxle with a single clutch as well as pushrod-operated adjustable suspension, carbon-ceramic brakes with red-painted calipers, active aerodynamics, black leather upholstery, an aluminum gearshift mechanism with exposed linkage, a Sonus faber sound system, and a touchscreen infotainment system. A 10-year service performed by Prestige Imports of North Miami Beach, Florida, was completed in November 2024, and it included the installation of replacement oxygen sensors and a rear bonnet gas spring as well as fluid services. Now showing 5k miles, this Tempesta-spec Huayra is offered on dealer consignment in Jupiter, Florida, with fitted luggage, a Huayra-shaped key, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title.",

A 10-year service performed by Prestige Imports of North Miami Beach, Florida, was completed in November 2024, and it included the installation of replacement oxygen sensors and a rear bonnet gas spring as well as fluid services. Now showing 5k miles, this Tempesta-spec Huayra is offered on dealer consignment in Jupiter, Florida, with fitted luggage, a Huayra-shaped key, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title. Developed over the course of seven years and named after the Aymara god of wind, the Huayra was unveiled in February 2011 as a follow-up to Pagani’s first model, the Zonda, and carried over the Modena-based manufacturer’s partnership with Mercedes-AMG. The Huayra’s construction incorporates a carbon-titanium monocoque structure with chromoly front and rear subframes and a composite safety cell surrounding the fuel tank, while the carbon-fiber body features a wing-shaped profile that utilizes active aerodynamics. This example is finished in silver with exposed carbon-fiber nose panels and door tops. A replacement front splitter and rear diffuser were installed as part of the Tempesta package in 2018, while pairs of control flaps at the front and rear combine with a hydropneumatic active front lift system and ECU and ABS data to optimize aerodynamic efficiency and stability as well as to assist with braking. Additional design elements include gullwing doors, exposed carbon-fiber leaf-shaped side mirrors, quad bi-xenon headlights with LED running lights, and black leather front and rear clamshell retaining straps. Forged aluminum alloy wheels measure 20″ up front and 21″ out back, and they were installed as part of the Tempesta package in 2018 along with 255/30 front and 355/25 rear Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires. Stopping is handled by Brembo carbon-ceramic cross-drilled and ventilated disc brakes with red-painted calipers employing six pistons each up front and four pistons apiece at the rear. A brake fluid flush was performed in November 2024. The cockpit is trimmed in black leather with white contrast stitching over carbon-fiber-backed bucket seats that feature height adjustment knobs positioned between the occupants’ knees, while matching upholstery complements exposed carbon fiber on the door panels, center tunnel, and dash. Additional features include an aluminum shifter with exposed linkage, black leather headrest covers, power windows, automatic climate control, a Sonus faber sound system, and a touchscreen infotainment system housed in a solid aluminum upper console panel. The flat-bottomed carbon-fiber steering wheel is accented with black leather and is equipped with paddle shifters as well as hub-mounted controls for the lighting and windshield wiper. A configurable digital display is surrounded by metal-faced instrumentation that was produced by Swiss watchmakers and includes a 7k-rpm tachometer, a reverse-sweep 260-mph speedometer, and a pair of combination gauges. The digital odometer shows 5k miles, approximately 80 of which were added under current ownership. The 5,980cc M158 60° V12 was developed and built by Mercedes-AMG and features a pair of twin-scroll turbochargers, air-to-liquid intercoolers, dry-sump lubrication, an oil/water heat exchanger, two spark plugs per cylinder, and a Bosch ECU. Additional features include a two-stage fuel delivery system with dual pumps and an 85-liter tank, finned intercooler covers, dual intercooler radiators flanking two canted engine radiators in the nose panel. A Tempesta-specification titanium exhaust system was installed in 2018. Replacement oxygen sensors and a rear bonnet gas spring were fitted in November 2024, and fluid and filter services were also performed at that time. Power is sent to the rear wheels via an Xtrac 1007 seven-speed automated manual transaxle that features a transverse orientation, an aluminum case, and a single dual-plate clutch. A transmission fluid service was performed in November 2024. Suspension incorporates Avional double A-arms and pushrod-actuated adjustable Öhlins coilover shock absorbers that were installed in 2018. Replacement Tempesta carbon-fiber underbody panels were also installed at that time. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage. You are not connected to real-time updates.
