  "description": "Kia India has deleted the diesel-iMT powertrain option from the Sonet, Seltos and Carens. However, the iMT gearbox continues to be available with all three models’ turbo-petrol engine versions. Kia has also slightly rejigged the variant line-up of all three cars, so let’s look closer at the MY2025 updates. Kia Sonet Sonet MY2025 variant line-up. Kia used to offer the Sonet with a diesel-iMT powertrain in the HTX and HTX+ trims; the latter has been discontinued. Now, Kia has introduced the HTK+(O) trim, which sits between the HTK(O) and HTX trims and is available with the 1.2-litre petrol-MT and 1.0-litre turbo-petrol-iMT powertrains. Kia has also dropped the Gravity Edition models from the Sonet line-up. Prices for the Sonet currently range between Rs 8.00 lakh and Rs 15.70 lakh. Kia Seltos Seltos MY2025 variant line-up. In the Seltos line-up, only the mid-spec HTX trim came with the diesel-iMT powertrain, which is not available anymore. Like in the Sonet, Seltos’ Gravity Edition stands discontinued. However, Kia has introduced three new trims: HTK(O), HTK+(O) and HTX (O), with some reshuffling of features as well. Also, the GT Line comes only in fully loaded GTX+ trim instead of GTX and GTX+ trims. The Seltos’ prices range between Rs 11.13 lakh and Rs 20.51 lakh.     Kia Carens Carens MY2025 variant line-up. In the Carens, apart from removing the diesel-iMT powertrain, Kia delisted the Luxury trim, with six- and seven-seater configurations. Also, the petrol-iMT powertrain is available in fewer trims now, and the diesel-AT can be only had in the Prestige Plus (O) trim. Lastly, the X-Line trim, previously available in both turbo-petrol-DCT and diesel-AT versions, is now only available with the former. Interestingly, though, the Carens’ Gravity Edition continues to be available. Prices for the Carens are in the Rs 10.60 lakh-Rs 19.70 lakh range.  Also See: Kia Carnival Hi Limousine on display at Auto Expo 2025 Kia EV6 facelift debuts at Auto Expo 2025",
