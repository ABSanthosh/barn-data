  "description": "This 1968 Ford Mustang coupe was initially delivered to Beattie Motors in Monterey, California, and is one of 4,118 examples ordered with the California Special equipment package. It was purchased by the seller's parents-in-law in December 1989, and subsequent modifications have included overboring the 302ci V8 and installing TRW pistons, a revised camshaft, and Tri-Y headers. A Doug Nash five-speed manual transmission was also installed along with a McLeod clutch and flywheel and a Ford 9\" rear end with a limited-slip differential and 31-spline axles. Finished in Lime Gold, the car rides on 15\" Cobra-style wheels and is equipped with Koni shocks, revised anti-sway bars, disc brakes, fog lights, and exposed hood locks. The refreshed interior features black vinyl upholstery, a Nardi steering wheel, a Hurst shifter, a push-button radio, and an 8-track cassette player. This California Special coupe is now offered by the seller with a Deluxe Marti Report and a clean California title in the name of the owners.",

A Doug Nash five-speed manual transmission was also installed along with a McLeod clutch and flywheel and a Ford 9″ rear end with a limited-slip differential and 31-spline axles. Finished in Lime Gold, the car rides on 15″ Cobra-style wheels and is equipped with Koni shocks, revised anti-sway bars, disc brakes, fog lights, and exposed hood locks. The refreshed interior features black vinyl upholstery, a Nardi steering wheel, a Hurst shifter, a push-button radio, and an 8-track cassette player. This California Special coupe is now offered by the seller with a Deluxe Marti Report and a clean California title in the name of the owners. The car is finished in Lime Gold (I) and features California Special equipment, including exposed hood locks and fiberglass trunk lid and quarter panel extensions. Additional details include fog lights, hood vents, and quad exhaust outlets. Cobra badging has been added, and previously fitted side stripes were removed under current ownership. Shelby Cobra-style 15″ 10-spoke wheels are mounted with Goodyear tires. Suspension modifications include revised front coils, a 1″ front anti-sway bar, a 3/4″ rear sway bar, and Koni shocks. Braking is handled by power-assisted discs. The refreshed cabin houses front bucket seats and a rear bench upholstered in black vinyl, which is complemented by coordinated door panels and black carpets. The dash pad and interior trim were replaced along with the heater core, dome light, and rear window deck. Appointments include a Hurst shifter, a push-button AM radio, and an 8-track player located behind a sliding cover. The woodgrain-rimmed Nardi steering wheel is adorned with a Cobra center cap and sits ahead of replacement instrumentation, including a 120-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges. An 8k-rpm tachometer is secured to the steering column, and additional readouts are mounted below the dash. The five-digit odometer shows 6,500 miles, which is said to represent the miles traveled since the engine work was completed. The seller tells us that the 302ci V8 was bored .030″ over and fitted with a Holley carburetor, TRW pistons, a revised camshaft, solid lifters, and Tri-Y headers. The five-speed manual transmission is said to be a Doug Nash unit that is linked to a Ford 9″ rear end with a Traction-Lok differential and 31-spline axles. A McLeod clutch, pressure plate, and flywheel are also fitted. Decoding the trim tag provides the following information: 65A – Coupe w/standard interior I – Lime Gold paint 2A – Black, standard buckets 13C – March 13 production 72 – San Jose, California DSO 5 – 3.00:1 standard differential W – C-4 automatic transmission The Deluxe Marti Report shows production information and a build date of March 18, 1968.
