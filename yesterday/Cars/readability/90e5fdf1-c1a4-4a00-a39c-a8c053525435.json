This F355 Berlinetta shows 19k miles and is now offered by the selling dealer in California with a tool kit, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title. The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Red (Rosso) Corsa, and styling incorporates pop-up headlights, integrated front fog lights, an integrated rear decklid spoiler, quad exhaust outlets, a vented engine cover, and air intakes on the doors and rocker panels. Close-up photos of the exterior are provided in the gallery below. The 18″ five-spoke magnesium wheels are mounted with 225/40 front and 265/40 rear Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires that were installed in July 2023. Ferrari-branded brake calipers are mounted over ventilated discs at each corner. The center caps were replaced in 2023. The cabin features sport seats trimmed in Tan Connolly leather, and matching leather extends to the center console, door panel inserts, and lower half of the dashboard. Amenities include a gated shifter, automatic climate control, a Continental stereo, and drilled aluminum pedals. The selling dealer notes that sticky buttons have been refinished. The air conditioning system was repaired in 2023. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 200-mph speedometer, a 10k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for oil pressure and coolant temperature. Ancillary instruments in the center stack include an analog clock and gauges for fuel level and oil temperature. The six-digit odometer shows 19k miles. The mid-mounted 3.5-liter DOHC V8 features five valves per cylinder and dry-sump lubrication for a factory-rated output of 375 horsepower and 268 lb-ft of torque. An engine-out timing belt service was most recently performed in 2021. The valve covers were refinished and the valve cover gaskets were replaced in 2023. Power is routed to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. An ANSA exhaust system was installed in 2023, and Fabspeed catalytic converters were installed in 2024. The car most recently passed a California smog test in March 2004.
