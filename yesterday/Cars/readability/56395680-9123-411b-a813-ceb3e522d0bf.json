  "description": "SUVs are all the rage today, but no one told the Dzire that. It continues to be a strong seller. Last year, the compact sedan found 1.57 lakh buyers – that’s more than all its competitors combined. Even more impressive is that this figure puts it ahead of compact SUVs like the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet and Maruti Fronx. So, unlike the Ciaz, Maruti has lavished plenty of attention on this sedan, with regular updates since the original was launched in 2008. As with all predecessors, the Dzire is based on the Swift, and this new model shares its underpinnings with the latest Swift, which was introduced earlier this year. While it’s based on the previous car and shares its ‘Heartect’ platform, there are massive changes to technical bits, such as the suspension and the structural elements of the body. There are aesthetic changes too, and thus, Maruti classifies this as the 4th generation. LED headlights with integrated DRLs now horizontally oriented. Except for the height, where the new Dzire is 10mm taller at 1,525mm, the new car is identical to the outgoing model in length (3,995mm), width (1,735mm), and wheelbase (2,450mm). The width and wheelbase are also identical to those of the new Swift. Maruti Suzuki Dzire exterior style With each generation, Maruti has further distanced the Dzire from the Swift, and this one sees the maximum separation. One look, or even a good long stare at the two cars outside, will not clue you into their shared genes. The Dzire looks very different, and the styling is very sedan-like with a horizontal orientation, unlike the previous car, which carried vertically styled elements. That’s clearly seen with the LED headlights, which are narrow, horizontally shaped units housing thin DRLs and crystal-like cube elements laid out horizontally. The grille has an Audi-esque familiarity to it, thanks to the large trapezoidal shape. That said, though, the Dzire’s front end has its own style and looks very smart and elegant, topped by a flatter bonnet compared to the previous car. Alloys are 15-inch units with 185/65 section tyres. On the side, the curves on the doors look similar to the model before, but with the reshaped front and rear fenders, the new car does stand apart. Alloys are newly designed units, 15 inches in diameter, and carry 185/65 sized tyres. Atop, there’s a shark fin antenna instead of a regular one. The tail-lights are squarish but carry a tri-arrow-shaped LED light signature laid horizontally, and that lends more visual width to the car. The boot has an added lip spoiler, and the lower edge of the bumper has a sporty-looking chamfered strip moulded into it. It helps widen the car visually and will make for a sporty touch with some contrasting shade. Dzire RS coming up, Suzuki? Lower edge of the bumper features a sporty-looking chamfered strip.   Maruti Suzuki Dzire interior style, space and comfort While the exterior bears no resemblance to the Swift, the interior is nearly identical. The dashboard, centre console, steering wheel, and instrument panel are all carried over but have a different colour scheme that uses beige on the dash, door pads and seats, and wood trim across the dash. It looks smart and neat, and all controls are well laid out and easy to use. While some might have preferred a fully digital instrument panel with a graphics-heavy design, the twin dials look neat, sporty, and very easy to read at a glance. Faux wood trim on the dashboard adds a premium touch. Front seats are comfy with soft cushioning, and overall space is just fine; at the rear, however, headroom is tight. Despite the 5mm increase in height over the Swift, headroom feels compromised, largely due to the sunroof, which has resulted in a lower headliner. The liner is scooped out towards the rear, but I had just about a three-finger space to the top, and the roof does feel close to your head. Comfort-wise, the seat is fine, softly cushioned like the front, and there’s a rear armrest, twin AC vents, and two USB ports for rear passengers. Boot space is just about adequate, at 382 litres – the lowest in the class – and the rear seat back is fixed (cannot be folded down).   Lower headliner thanks to sunroof limits headroom.    Maruti Suzuki Dzire features and safety Big new features on the Dzire are a sunroof and a 360-degree camera; while the sunroof is small and has a more feel-good factor, the 360-degree camera offers a clear view with a 3D display and dynamic rear parking lines. Other features are a 9-inch touchscreen unit with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, wireless phone charging, connected car tech, and cruise control. Given what’s on offer today in this price segment, Maruti Suzuki should have had a few more features, such as premium audio hardware, cooled seats, and ambient lighting.  360-degree camera offers a clear view with a 3D display. While these features go amiss, it’s nice to see that the safety kit is elaborate and standard across variants. Six airbags, 3-point seatbelts for all occupants, ISO-FIX child seat mounts, ABS, ESP, and Hill Hold Assist will feature in every Dzire sold. What’s even nicer to see, and will be a big surprise for many, is the 5-star adult occupant and 4-star child occupant protection rating the Dzire has scored under the GNCAP safety protocol. The performance in these new enhanced safety protocols is commendable, and while it may not be a 360-degree assessment of everything that can go wrong, it covers a significant portion of road accidents and is a good barometer for the safety potential of a car. Maruti Suzuki Dzire engine and performance The new Dzire is powered by the recently introduced Z12E engine that debuted with the new Swift. Like in the Swift, the 3-cylinder unit puts out an identical 82hp at 5700rpm and 112Nm of torque at 4300rpm. It feels identical in nature too. There are some vibrations at low rpms, but these fade away as you drive on. The engine is quite audible, but at low and mid speeds, it has a likeable audio note with it, only sounding strained at the top end. 82hp engine lacks pep but has good low-end response. 82hp may not sound like much, and indeed, it is 8hp lower than the outgoing K12M engine. However, at low engine speeds, the response is good and the car moves off the line cleanly and crisply. Power then builds up in a gentle and linear fashion, and keeps coming in even above 5,000rpm, so there is some merit in revving it further. Those who like a spirited drive will end up doing so, as the engine isn’t peppy and lively. It even red lines at 6,000rpm, which is about 400rpm lower than the previous unit. In a quick test, it took over 13 seconds to 100kph from zero, which is slower than the previous car. However, we’ll soon put it through our standard instrument tests to measure all the figures. Don’t hold your breath, though, as the Dzire will be slower than the Swift, which itself wasn’t very impressive. Wheelbase is identical to the previous-gen Dzire. Going through the gears isn't a chore; the 5-speed gearbox has been tweaked and features a new hydraulic clutch. It's very smooth and light in effort, and the gear throws are also light and easy. Shifts on the AMT are smooth and at a moderate pace, and there's a minimal gap between shifts; it also downshifts a gear or two readily, but put your foot down and the pause gets very pronounced, and this does slow down the car during hard acceleration. There is a tip function to the gear lever that enables you to manually control shifts.  Both manual and AMT are smooth shifting gearboxes.  The main calling card for the new powerplant is efficiency, with the Dzire now claiming a figure of 24.79kpl for the 5-speed manual, which is up from the earlier cars' 23.26kpl claim. The AMT version claims a figure of 25.71kpl. There's also a CNG version, which we are yet to drive, and that promises 33.73kms/kg from its 70ps and 102Nm power unit. Maruti Suzuki Dzire ride and handling Like the powertrain, the Dzire’s suspension hardware is also carried over from the Swift, with McPherson struts at the front and a torsion beam setup at the rear. Small tweaks have been made to the spring and dampers; however, these are only to compensate for the increase in kerb weight, which, at 960 kg, is 40 kilos more than the Swift. The character thus remains the same, and that’s a very good thing. Like the hatch, the sedan also rides very well; bump absorption is good, and regular potholes and ruts are smoothed out well. Ride is comfy and compliant with agile handling. On the handling front, too, it impresses like the Swift. The electric power steering is smooth and fluid, and it returns to the centre in a very natural manner. Push it hard, and there is some body roll, but for everyday and even some spirited driving, it corners well with a progressive and controlled lean, offering good road grip.   Maruti Suzuki Dzire price and verdict Maruti Suzuki has clearly put in significant effort with the new Dzire. The car looks and feels very different from before; it’s elegant and more sedan-like, and that’s commendable given the tight confines of its sub-4-meter footprint. It rides very well, the handling is good and sporty, and the engine is more than adequate for everyday driving. It’s well equipped, too, and features like the sunroof and 360-degree camera will be appreciated, as will the fact that this is Maruti Suzuki’s first 5-star GNCAP car. It’s priced between Rs 6.79 lakh and Rs 10.14 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). So is it perfect, then? No, rear headroom is tight, and it should have offered a few more of today’s must-have features, but this won’t be enough to deter buyers, especially not when you weigh it against its impressive breadth of abilities. So, like its predecessor, the new Dzire will continue to ring the cash register for Maruti and is all set to carry on being the flagbearer for sedans in an increasingly dominant SUV world.

Given what’s on offer today in this price segment, Maruti Suzuki should have had a few more features, such as premium audio hardware, cooled seats, and ambient lighting. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/6 (11).jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e360-degree camera offers a clear view with a 3D display.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile these features go amiss, it’s nice to see that the safety kit is elaborate and standard across variants. Six airbags, 3-point seatbelts for all occupants, ISO-FIX child seat mounts, ABS, ESP, and Hill Hold Assist will feature in every Dzire sold. What’s even nicer to see, and will be a big surprise for many, is the 5-star adult occupant and 4-star child occupant protection rating the Dzire has scored under the GNCAP safety protocol. The performance in these new enhanced safety protocols is commendable, and while it may not be a 360-degree assessment of everything that can go wrong, it covers a significant portion of road accidents and is a good barometer for the safety potential of a car.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaruti Suzuki Dzire engine and performance\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe new Dzire is powered by the recently introduced Z12E engine that debuted with the new Swift. Like in the Swift, the 3-cylinder unit puts out an identical 82hp at 5700rpm and 112Nm of torque at 4300rpm. It feels identical in nature too. There are some vibrations at low rpms, but these fade away as you drive on. The engine is quite audible, but at low and mid speeds, it has a likeable audio note with it, only sounding strained at the top end.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/3 (23).jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e82hp engine lacks pep but has good low-end response.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e82hp may not sound like much, and indeed, it is 8hp lower than the outgoing K12M engine. However, at low engine speeds, the response is good and the car moves off the line cleanly and crisply.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePower then builds up in a gentle and linear fashion, and keeps coming in even above 5,000rpm, so there is some merit in revving it further. Those who like a spirited drive will end up doing so, as the engine isn’t peppy and lively. It even red lines at 6,000rpm, which is about 400rpm lower than the previous unit. In a quick test, it took over 13 seconds to 100kph from zero, which is slower than the previous car. However, we’ll soon put it through our standard instrument tests to measure all the figures. Don’t hold your breath, though, as the Dzire will be slower than the Swift, which itself wasn’t very impressive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/8 (10).jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWheelbase is identical to the previous-gen Dzire.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eGoing through the gears isn\u0026#39;t a chore; the 5-speed gearbox has been tweaked and features a new hydraulic clutch. It\u0026#39;s very smooth and light in effort, and the gear throws are also light and easy. Shifts on the AMT are smooth and at a moderate pace, and there\u0026#39;s a minimal gap between shifts; it also downshifts a gear or two readily, but put your foot down and the pause gets very pronounced, and this does slow down the car during hard acceleration. There is a tip function to the gear lever that enables you to manually control shifts. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/5 (13).jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBoth manual and AMT are smooth shifting gearboxes. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe main calling card for the new powerplant is efficiency, with the Dzire now claiming a figure of 24.79kpl for the 5-speed manual, which is up from the earlier cars\u0026#39; 23.26kpl claim. The AMT version claims a figure of 25.71kpl.

Small tweaks have been made to the spring and dampers; however, these are only to compensate for the increase in kerb weight, which, at 960 kg, is 40 kilos more than the Swift. The character thus remains the same, and that’s a very good thing. Like the hatch, the sedan also rides very well; bump absorption is good, and regular potholes and ruts are smoothed out well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20241111075006_7 (10).jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRide is comfy and compliant with agile handling.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the handling front, too, it impresses like the Swift.

The car looks and feels very different from before; it’s elegant and more sedan-like, and that’s commendable given the tight confines of its sub-4-meter footprint. It rides very well, the handling is good and sporty, and the engine is more than adequate for everyday driving. It’s well equipped, too, and features like the sunroof and 360-degree camera will be appreciated, as will the fact that this is Maruti Suzuki’s first 5-star GNCAP car. It’s priced between Rs 6.79 lakh and Rs 10.14 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20241111075052_18 (1).jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo is it perfect, then? No, rear headroom is tight, and it should have offered a few more of today’s must-have features, but this won’t be enough to deter buyers, especially not when you weigh it against its impressive breadth of abilities.
