  "description": "Chinese manufacturer BYD (Build Your Dreams) is perhaps best known in India for its Atto 3 electric SUV and the Seal electric sedan, but BYD began its India chapter with the launch of the e6 electric MPV. It was initially offered just to fleet operators, but when sales opened to personal buyers, it couldn’t shake its commercial image. That’s where this new eMax 7 comes in. Essentially a revised and improved version of the e6, the eMax 7 comes with a larger battery, more features and a third row of seats. BYD eMax 7 platform, powertrain Before we get to the cosmetic and interior bits, let’s talk about what’s under the eMax 7’s skin because it is interesting. It makes use of BYD’s e-platform 3.0, which includes the innovative Blade battery and an 8-in-1 electric powertrain. BYD’s Blade battery has a reputation of being one of the safest batteries out there, having passed tough safety tests like nail penetration, strength and bend tests. The unique arrangement of the cells in a blade-like formation also allows for efficient heat transfer and BYD says it can maintain its energy density for a long time. This is backed up by the 8 year/1,60,000km standard warranty that the battery comes with; the motor has a similar 8 year/1,50,000km warranty. Like the battery, the new 8-in-1 electric powertrain also allows for tighter packaging and it’s more energy efficient. This system essentially integrates eight components of the electric powertrain like the motor, reducer, on-board charger, battery management system and more. Though this frees up quite a bit of room under the bonnet, BYD has opted not to provide a frunk even though they could easily have done so.   BYD eMax 7 performance, range The range-topping eMax 7 Superior puts out 204hp and 310Nm to the front wheels, which is said to be good enough for a 0-100kph time of 8.6 seconds. Compared to the older e6, this is 109hp and 130Nm more. The entry-level Premium variant produces a lower 163hp but has the same 310Nm for a claimed 0-100kph time of 10.1 seconds. BYD also claims a top speed of 180kph for both variants, and though we weren’t able to verify its performance claims, the eMax 7 Superior we sampled does feel sprightly on the move. As with any EV, the instant torque means it feels brisk off the line. But, keeping with this MPV’s family and chauffeur-driven purposes, BYD has done a good job of making the power delivery linear. However, a prod on the throttle makes it respond instantaneously – typical of EVs – that makes darting in and out of gaps in traffic a breeze. There’s three drive modes on offer – Eco, Normal and Sport; Eco being the most conservative and Sport being the most aggressive. The difference between them isn’t huge, but, as expected, the eMax 7 does feel most energetic in Sport. The Superior draws power from a 71.8kWh battery pack that is said to give it a range of 530km (NEDC cycle), while the Premium’s 55.4kWh pack is claimed to do 420km. During our drive, we covered 137km, which depleted 45 percent of the MPV’s battery. This should translate into a real-world range of around 350km, which is respectable. Mind you, our running was done in the sweltering Chennai heat, with a mix of highway and city driving using different drive modes. As for charging, the Superior’s larger battery can be topped up using a 115kW DC fast charger, which is said to take it from 0-80 percent within 37 minutes. And, like the rest of BYD's range, the eMax 7 is also capable of vehicle-to-load charging, meaning it can power appliances.   There’s two regen modes – Standard and Larger – with the latter recouping charge in a more aggressive manner. Again, like the drive modes though, the difference between modes isn’t huge and what’s nice is that both allow for some coasting so you don’t have to be on and off the throttle constantly. BYD eMax 7 ride and handling On the move, the eMax 7 impresses with its ride quality, which is absorbent and on the softer side at low speeds. As the speeds rise though, it tightens up and there’s very little vertical or side-to-side movement, even over expansion joints. Body roll is also kept well in check around corners and the overall handling feels predictable. The BYD then, is a composed MPV that feels equally at home in the city and out on the highway. The steering is one of the eMax’s weak points. It’s slow to respond, there’s little feel or feedback from it and in certain cases it weighed up unnaturally. What also plays a part in this is the lane keep assist, which will vibrate the steering or even make small corrections depending on the setting you’re in, and this can be unnerving if you aren’t used to it. There is a Sport mode for the steering, but even that has little effect. Coming to the styling, I’ll keep it brief since it’s subjective. The eMax 7 is more of an evolution rather than revolution from the erstwhile e6. The front bumper and grille are all-new and the revised headlights now feature LED elements. Along the sides, the only prominent change is the alloy wheel design. Moving to the back, the eMax 7 gets an LED light bar that connects the new-look LED tail-lamps and a reprofiled bumper. On the whole, the design is inoffensive and a bit too plain to my eyes.   BYD eMax 7 interiors, features Step inside and you’re greeted by a clean and neat dashboard design that’s devoid of many physical buttons, as was the case with the e6. That’s because a majority of the functions are baked into the high-res 12.8-inch touchscreen, which is without doubt the highlight of the cabin. In typical BYD fashion, the screen’s orientation can also be changed from landscape to portrait at the touch of a button. The screen’s UI is easy to understand and navigate and it’s as slick to operate as a tablet. Material quality and fit and finish on the whole are good, but there are some hard plastics in the cabin. What’s nice though is that there’s plenty of storage spaces and cubbies for your belongings. What could have been better is the instrument cluster as the analogue dials just feel too old and important data such as the SoC appear too small.   Getting into the eMax is also an easy affair as the seats are quite low-set and you don’t climb into the cabin. The front seats are well-cushioned and they both get electric adjustability along with ventilation. While the 6-seater version we tested featured two captain’s chairs in the middle with armrests, the 7-seater version gets a bench layout. Like the ones at front, these seats are also comfy, but the high floor means that you sit quite knees-up. This robs you of under-thigh support, especially for taller people. Passengers at the rear are well-catered to, as you get individual AC vents on the roof with blower control, USB charging ports and front seatback pockets for storage. What’s nice is that the middle row has a sliding function and it can be folded, too.   In the 6-seater, the easiest way to get to the third row is by walking in the middle of the two captain’s chairs. Once back here, space is actually ample for adults and you get AC vents, cupholders, adjustable headrests and three-point seatbelts. Here, too, the lack of under-thigh support due to the knees-up seating position is a downer. With all rows up, boot space is a nominal 180 litres, but with the third row folded, it opens up to 580 litres. However, there’s no spare tyre on offer.   Apart from the aforementioned features, the eMax 7 Superior packs a crisp 360-degree camera, a large panoramic glass roof that extends from front to back and really accentuates the sense of space in the cabin, brown leatherette upholstery, two wireless phone chargers, a PM 2.5 air filtration system, a 6-speaker audio system, powered tailgate, 6 airbags, TPMS and lock/unlock using an NFC card. There’s also Level 2 ADAS as part of the package, with features like adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, blind spot detection, auto emergency braking and more. In our brief time, we didn’t get to fully experience the ADAS suite but the lane keep and AEB did work as intended. It’s also nice that these can be turned off completely, should you choose to do so.   BYD eMax 7 price and verdict Pricing for the BYD eMax 7 starts at Rs 26.90 lakh for the Premium 6-seater and goes up to Rs 29.90 lakh (ex-showroom) for the Superior 7-seater. This MPV does have its drawbacks: it isn’t as large or roomy inside like the MPV it’ll invariably be compared against, the Innova Hycross; the steering isn’t confidence inspiring; and it doesn’t have the flash or brand value. But the eMax 7 is a trailblazer for electric MPVs, and as such, has a lot going for it. What it does do admirably well is ferry up to seven people around in silence and comfort, with the benefits of lower running costs, a respectable real-world range and the latest features. So for those looking for a family EV that’s well suited to the city and the highway, the BYD eMax 7 is your only choice for now. Also see: BYD eMax 7 video review",

Passengers at the rear are well-catered to, as you get individual AC vents on the roof with blower control, USB charging ports and front seatback pockets for storage. What’s nice is that the middle row has a sliding function and it can be folded, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BYD eMax 7 second row\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/BYD-eMax-7-review-second-row.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"BYD eMax 7 second row\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the 6-seater, the easiest way to get to the third row is by walking in the middle of the two captain’s chairs. Once back here, space is actually ample for adults and you get AC vents, cupholders, adjustable headrests and three-point seatbelts. Here, too, the lack of under-thigh support due to the knees-up seating position is a downer. With all rows up, boot space is a nominal 180 litres, but with the third row folded, it opens up to 580 litres. However, there’s no spare tyre on offer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BYD eMax 7 third row\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/BYD-eMax-7-review-third-row.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"BYD eMax 7 third row\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eApart from the aforementioned features, the eMax 7 Superior packs a crisp 360-degree camera, a large panoramic glass roof that extends from front to back and really accentuates the sense of space in the cabin, brown leatherette upholstery, two wireless phone chargers, a PM 2.5 air filtration system, a 6-speaker audio system, powered tailgate, 6 airbags, TPMS and lock/unlock using an NFC card.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s also Level 2 ADAS as part of the package, with features like adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, blind spot detection, auto emergency braking and more. In our brief time, we didn’t get to fully experience the ADAS suite but the lane keep and AEB did work as intended. It’s also nice that these can be turned off completely, should you choose to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BYD eMax 7 infotainment\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/BYD-eMax-7-review-potrait-infotainment.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"BYD eMax 7 infotainment\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBYD eMax 7 price and verdict\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003ePricing for the BYD eMax 7 starts at Rs 26.90 lakh for the Premium 6-seater and goes up to Rs 29.90 lakh (ex-showroom) for the Superior 7-seater. This MPV does have its drawbacks: it isn’t as large or roomy inside like the MPV it’ll invariably be compared against, the Innova Hycross; the steering isn’t confidence inspiring; and it doesn’t have the flash or brand value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the eMax 7 is a trailblazer for electric MPVs, and as such, has a lot going for it. What it does do admirably well is ferry up to seven people around in silence and comfort, with the benefits of lower running costs, a respectable real-world range and the latest features. So for those looking for a family EV that’s well suited to the city and the highway, the BYD eMax 7 is your only choice for now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso see:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-video-reviews/byd-emax-7-video-review-433351\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBYD eMax 7 video review\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"tagged-articles-container-433337\"\u003e\u003cul id=\"tab-id-433337\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-vidhref-id-433337\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-videos-container-433337\"\u003eVideos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
