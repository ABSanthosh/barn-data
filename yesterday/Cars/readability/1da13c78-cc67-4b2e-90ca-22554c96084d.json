  "text": "Search around for a Grenadier and you may be able to find yourself a bargain 2 hours ago by Brad Anderson This Grenadier had an MSRP of $84,320 but traded hands for $64.5k after 760 miles. The seller had it equipped with a rear-seat delete kit that can be easily reversed. Power is provided by BMW‘s superb B58 turbocharged petrol 3.0-liter inline-six. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the billionaire behind the Ineos chemicals empire, deserves recognition for his ambitious foray into the automotive world. Following the announcement that Jaguar Land Rover would discontinue the original Defender, Ratcliffe set out to create a worthy successor, ultimately launching production of the Grenadier in late 2022. Read: Ineos Hikes Prices As Trump’s Tariffs Hit US Consumers For shoppers who don’t want something like a new Defender or a Mercedes-Benz G-Class, the Grenadier offers a compelling choice. A Shrewd Alternative in the Used Market However, buying one new might not be the best option as depreciation makes lightly used examples significantly more affordable.  Earlier this month, a 2024 Grenadier Trailmaster Edition traded hands for $64,500 with just 760 miles (1,234 kilometers) on the clock on Bring a Trailer. While that’s pricier than the most basic Land Rover Defender 110 available, it represents a near-$20,000 loss from this model’s original price tag of $84,320. There’s no word on why the original owner has parted ways with the off-roader so soon, but the winning bidder looks to have scored themselves an excellent deal. This Grenadier has been well specced and is painted in a simple shade of black with matching black 17-inch steel wheels and BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A KO2 tires. It looks absolutely pristine in these photos, but is dying to be driven in the dirt and used as it was designed to be. Bring a Trailer Several options have been added to it, including a rear ladder, a raised air intake, and a fuel container positioned in the center of the spare wheel. The interior has also been modified and includes a rear-seat delete kit from Goose Gear. Sitting in the place of the rear seats is a flat floor with large storage boxes. Admittedly, a two-seat Grenadier isn’t particularly practical, but the delete kit is fully reversible. This example was optioned with the turbocharged 3.0-liter BMW B58 inline-six producing 281 hp and 331 lb-ft (449 Nm) of torque. The petrol engine is coupled to an eight-speed automatic transmission from ZF and includes a dual-range transfer case as well as locking front, center, and rear differentials. Consider a Pre-Owned Grenadier If you’re in the market for a Grenadier, be sure to take a look at the used market before you commit to buying a new one, as you could save tens of thousands of dollars. Maybe Sir Ratcliffe won’t like it, but your bank account will be all the better for it. Bring a Trailer",
