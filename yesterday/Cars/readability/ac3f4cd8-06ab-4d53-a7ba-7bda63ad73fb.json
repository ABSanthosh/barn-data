  "text": "Power comes courtesy of a 6.0-liter twin-turbocharged V12 delivering 730 hp and 738 lb-ft February 7, 2025 at 19:33 by Brad Anderson The Huayra’s bodywork is finished in a combination of blue and white painted parts. Pagani equipped the car with its Tempesta package, adding plenty of new carbon parts. The 730 hp supercar’s tan and blue interior is just as dramatic as the exterior finish. Pagani only ever built 100 examples of the standard Huayra Coupe, but some of them are more special than others. Take this one-off version, for example. Dubbed the Oceano Pacifico, it was ordered by a Californian and has now hit the market. It’s a 2014 model that’s been driven just ~2,000 miles (~3,200 km), and it’s already attracting plenty of attention. The distinctive colorway of the car was inspired by the Pacific Ocean – hence its name. Most of the bodywork is painted in Blu Francia Metallic, while there are Biano Fabriano white accents on the rocker panels and rear fascia. There are plenty of exposed Blu Tricolore pieces of carbon fiber, too, including on the nose, roof, and rear decklid. Read: Pagani Huayra Tempesta Fails To Sell At Auction Despite $2,275,000 Bid Not long after the car was delivered to the original owner in California, it was sent back to Pagani’s factory and equipped with the optional Tempesta package that includes a titanium exhaust, a new front splitter, a carbon rear diffuser, and Ohlins coilovers at all four corners. It also sits on color-matched blue wheels, but a set of 20-inch front and 21-inch rear wheels painted in gold will also be included in the sale. Bring a Trailer It’s not just the Italian supercar’s exterior that’s bold. The cabin sports an eye-popping combination of Ocra leather with Blu Ossido Alcantara accents on parts of the seats, dashboard, and door panels. Like the outside, there’s also plenty of Blu Tricolore carbon fiber throughout, including on the steering wheel and gauge cluster. A set of quilted floor mats adds to the luxurious feel, as does a Sonus Faber sound system. It also features a custom ‘Oceano Pacifico 1 di 1’ plaque on the dashboard. Like all other standard Huayra models, the supercar rocks an AMG-sourced 6.0-liter twin-turbocharged V12 mated to a seven-speed automatic manual transaxle. This engine is good for 730 hp at 5,800 rpm and 738 lb-ft (1,000 Nm) of torque, monumental figures for a car that weighs roughly 2,976 lbs (1,350 kg). If you happen to have a couple of million dollars burning a hole in your pocket, you can head over to Bring a Trailer and place a bid. Bring a Trailer",
