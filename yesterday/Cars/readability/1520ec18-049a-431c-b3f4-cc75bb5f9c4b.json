It is powered by a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 linked with a six-speed manual gearbox and a helical limited-slip differential. The car is finished in Centennial White over Ebony leather and was factory optioned with forged aluminum BBS wheels, red-finished brake calipers, painted blue stripes, and a McIntosh stereo system. Additional equipment includes Brembo brakes, HID headlights, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, and air conditioning. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, this Ford GT has 3,600 miles and is now offered with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, a car cover, a Ford certificate of authenticity, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title. The Camilo Pardo-designed GT was styled as an homage to the Le Mans-winning GT40 racing cars of the 1960s and features aluminum body panels over an extruded-aluminum space frame and roll-bonded floors. This example is one of 503 finished in Centennial White for the model year and features optional over-the-top blue stripes and Ford GT graphics, HID headlights, fog lights, side air intakes, a vented hood, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, and a dual center-exit exhaust system. Factory-optional BBS forged lightweight aluminum wheels measure 18” up front and 19” out back and are mounted with Goodyear Eagle F1 tires. The Brembo braking system features optional red-painted four-piston monoblock calipers with cross-drilled and ventilated rotors that measure 14” up front and 13.2” out back. The cockpit is trimmed in Ebony leather, and Ford GT-branded mats cover bare aluminum floors. Manually adjusted seats were designed by Sparco and feature carbon-fiber shells with GT40-style ventilation grommets and harness slots. The console on the center tunnel houses rotary climate controls, and amenities include a McIntosh CD stereo, air conditioning, remote keyless entry, and push-button ignition. The leather-wrapped steering wheel is affixed to a tilting and telescoping column ahead of the GT40-inspired instrument array consisting of a central tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline and an offset 220-mph speedometer. Toggle-switch controls are positioned under additional gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, boost, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 3,600 miles. The mid-mounted 5.4-liter DOHC V8 features an aluminum block, cylinder heads, and pistons in addition to a Lysholm screw-type supercharger, a dry-sump lubrication system, and a water-to-air intercooler. Factory-rated output was 550 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Ricardo six-speed manual transaxle and a helical limited-slip differential. An oil change was performed in 2024. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Gainesville Ford in Florida, along with factory colors, equipment, options, and a total MSRP of $156,945. A Ford certificate of authenticity lists the date of manufacture and production numbers. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates.
