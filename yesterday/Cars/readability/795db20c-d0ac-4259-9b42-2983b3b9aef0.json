Finished in black over Sand leather upholstery, the car is powered by a turbocharged 2.2-liter inline-four paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Features include 15″ and 16″ five-spoke alloy wheels, anti-lock disc brakes, a sunroof, a rear spoiler, pop-up headlights, fog lights, air conditioning, and a cassette stereo. This Esprit is offered on dealer consignment with a roof panel storage bag, manufacturer’s literature, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Colorado title. The car is finished in Black (B02), and exterior details include a sunroof, a rear spoiler, a removable roof panel, later-model door handles, pop-up headlights, fog lights, and a retractable antenna. There are paint chips in the forward-facing surfaces and paint cracks on the front valance and side skirts. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. The 15″ front and 16″ rear five-spoke alloy wheels are fitted with Hankook tires that were mounted in 2024. Braking is handled by ventilated anti-lock discs at each corner. The bucket seats are trimmed in Sand leather, and interior equipment includes air conditioning, power windows, and a cassette stereo with remote CD changer. As part of the transition to the S4 platform, the 1993.5 model is equipped with S4 style door handles, carbon fiber dash, and relocated window switches to the center console. There is wear on the driver’s seat bolster. Instrumentation consists of a 170-mph speedometer, a 7,400-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, boost pressure, fuel level, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 20k miles, approximately 2k of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted turbocharged DOHC 2.2-liter inline-four was factory-rated at 264 horsepower and 261 lb-ft of torque. An engine-out service was completed in 2014, at which time the timing belt, spark plugs, and camshaft cover were replaced. Power is routed to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transaxle. The clutch and clutch cylinders were replaced in 2012. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
