  "text": "The next generation of BMW's popular 3-Series will spawn a mild-hybrid M3 with over 600 hp December 14, 2024 at 19:20 by Brad Anderson The next i3 and 3-Series will likely have different platforms, but they will share styling cues. Standard models are expected to feature 2.0-liter and 3.0-liter turbocharged mild hybrids. Elements like the sides and rear quarter panels draw some inspiration from the 5-Series. An all-new BMW 3-Series is just around the corner and after a prototype was snapped wearing skin-tight camouflage last month, a handful of renderings have been shared online that attempt to decipher what the new sedan may look like. If these images are anything to go by, it may adopt a similar silhouette to the 5-Series, but with a fresh twist up front. Much like the all-electric i3 sedan that’s also in the works, the latest 3-Series will adopt many of the Neue Klasse design cues previewed by recent sedan and SUV concepts. BMW has done a good job of hiding important elements of the new design on its prototypes, but here, in these renderings from digital artist Kelsonik (for Autoreview), the luxury compact sedan is previewed with angular LED headlights and wide kidney grilles, which may – or may not – be featured on the production model. Read: Take A First Look At The New BMW 3-Series Bathed In Camouflage Looking beyond the front fascia, the bodywork of the new 3-Series will be thoroughly revised with lines similar to those of the 5-Series. Key changes will include new door handles, overhauled door skins, and slightly more subtle creases across the rear quarter panels. The rear fascia could also sit a little higher than the outgoing model and will inevitably include new taillights, perhaps also inspired by those of its bigger brother. Platform Divergence While BMW will sell the next-gen 3-Series alongside the new all-electric i3 sedan, the two are not expected to use the same underpinnings. You see, the i3 will be based on the newly-developed Neue Klasse platform, whereas the ICE-powered 3-Series will stick with the more familiar CLAR platform in an updated form. Illustrations Kelsonik/Autoreview Powertrain Options And M Models It’s likely that BMW will continue offering its familiar range of gasoline engines, including the 2.0-liter four-cylinder and 3.0-liter inline-six, both turbocharged and equipped with mild-hybrid technology for enhanced power and efficiency. The latter is expected to debut in M350 form. Diesel options will also remain available in certain markets, including Europe. There’s good news for M enthusiasts. Whereas Mercedes-AMG made the controversial decision to downsize the C63 to a four-cylinder, plug-in hybrid engine, the next-generation M3 will retain the brand’s signature 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged six with improved numbers. More: BMW’s Next ICE M3 Is A Mild Hybrid, Not A PHEV Like The Heavyweight M5 As we recently learned from BMW officials during our drive of the new M5 sedan and Touring, this powerplant will be supplemented with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, as opposed to the plug-in hybrid setup of the new M5. There’s no word on how much power the new car will have, but something north of 600 ponies seems probable. While we don’t have an official launch date yet, it’s highly likely the next 3-Series will debut alongside the new i3 Sedan in 2026, possibly as a 2027 model year.
