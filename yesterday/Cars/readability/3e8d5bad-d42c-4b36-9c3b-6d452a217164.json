  "text": "The 18-year-old driver escaped relatively unharmed but was later arrested for allegedly being over the legal alcohol limit November 7, 2024 at 19:05 by Michael Gauthier An 18-year-old driver miraculously survived a high-speed crash in Australia that cut his car in half. Authorities are still trying to figure out what happened, but the teen walked away without serious injury. The Sydney driver was later arrested and faces drunk driving charges after walking away from the wreck. An 18-year-old is lucky to be alive after his 2004 Mazda6 was sliced in half in a high-speed crash in Australia. The incident took place on November 5 at the intersection of Old Northern Road and Hill Street in Baulkham Hills, in Sydney, and the young man was somehow able to walk away from the scene. While the incident is under investigation, the back half of the sedan was sheared off and crashed into a nearby house. Remarkably, the front section of the car remained relatively intact and we can see the airbags successfully deployed. More: Mazda Driver Fleeing Police Plunges Off Cliff And Somehow Survives This helps to explain how the driver survived, but authorities are still trying to figure out what happened. However, a collision occurred between the Mazda and another vehicle being driven by a 45-year-old. They too appear to have escaped unharmed, but were taken to a hospital as a precaution. Following the crash, the driver of the Mazda was arrested for having a blood alcohol content of 0.110. That’s more than twice the limit of 0.05 in Australia. Police said the man’s license was “immediately suspended” and he’s now facing a charge of Mid-Range Drink Driving. According to a local law firm, a first offense could result in a $2,200 AUD ($1,470 USD) fine and up to nine months in jail. Offenders also reportedly lose their license for a year and will be subject to an interlock order. With officials pointing the blame at alcohol and speed, they’re using the crash to remind people not to drink and drive. As police noted, “drink driving and speeding are leading causes of road accidents and fatalities.” Image credits: The Hills Police Area Command",
