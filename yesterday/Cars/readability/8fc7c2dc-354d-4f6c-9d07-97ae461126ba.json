  "text": "Is BMW's new design direction, especially that of the rear end, as ugly as social media users make it seem? 3 hours ago by Brad Anderson The rear end of BMW’s Vision Driving Experience concept has received widespread criticism online. The EV concept features four electric motors, promising impressive performance but divisive styling. Back in February, BMW pulled the curtain back on its all-electric Vision Driving Experience study, giving us a conceptual peek at what’s coming with the first M-branded Neu Klasse EV. The German brand’s design direction has faced its fair share of criticism in recent years, and while they’re trying to embrace a fresh new look, it seems not everyone is onboard with their latest vision. Earlier this week, BMW published images of the Vision Driving Experience on its Instagram page, and the reception has not been all positive. A look through the comments shows that people have taken particular issue with the rear-end design of the EV, and we can’t blame them. Read: BMW Vision Vehicle Is Our Best Look Yet At The iM3 Neue Klasse We think BMW has done a nice job with the front-end design of its Neue Klasse concepts, ditching the hideous kidney grilles found on several existing models in favor of slimmer grilles that are joined seamlessly with the sharp LED headlights. However, the rear is a different story. While the front of the concept sits quite low, as a sports sedan should, the rear end is much more upright and sits far higher than it needs to. The taillights are also positioned at the very top of the tailgate and look out of place. People haven’t held back in voicing their opinion. “What the hell is this rear view,” one comment with over 6,500 likes reads. “Y’all need to fire your designer,” a user says, while another with over 3,000 likes says, “Tf are those rear lights.” One comment is a meme showing a large pile of excrement, while another says, “I will pay you a billion pounds not to make this.” A popular fitness influencer with 2.7 million followers also left a comment, saying “Front is smooth but wtf is that rear.” Since the piece went live, there have been a few positive comments sprinkled in, but they’re pretty much an afterthought, with likes numbering in the single digits. Safe to say, most people aren’t exactly lining up to praise this design. So, what do you think – does BMW need to go back to the drawing board, or are we just nitpicking? In any case, at this point, the concept‘s rear end might be the least of the brand’s worries when it comes to public opinion.",
