Powered by a 5.5-liter V12 paired with a six-speed manual transaxle, the car is finished in Rosso Corsa over tan leather upholstery. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels, fog lights, power-adjustable seats, a gated shifter, a cassette stereo, and automatic climate control. Work completed in 2023 included replacing the timing belts, drive belt, and battery. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, this 550 Maranello is offered with manufacturer’s literature, a tool kit, partial service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title. The 550 Maranello was styled by Pininfarina, and this example is finished in Rosso Corsa. Equipment includes projector-style headlights, fog lights, a hood scoop, a front spoiler, front fender vents, and quad exhaust tips exiting through the rear bumper cover. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. Silver 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Continental ExtremeContact tires that have 2022 and 2023 date codes. Braking is handled by black-finished Ferrari-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors at all four corners. The cabin features power-adjustable seats upholstered in tan leather. Black leather covers the upper dashboard, and amenities include a gated shifter, automatic climate control, electric windows, a cassette stereo, and rear luggage straps. There is a bend in the dashboard above the passenger airbag cover. The leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel fronts a Jaeger gauge cluster with a 220-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 7,600-rpm redline as well as gauges for coolant temperature and oil pressure, while an analog clock and gauges for oil temperature and fuel level are located atop the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 6k miles. The 5.5-liter quad-cam F133A V12 features 48 valves, dry-sump lubrication, and Bosch Motronic engine management for a factory-rated output of 478 horsepower and 419 lb-ft of torque. A timing belt service was completed in June 2023, at which time the tensioner bearing, drive belt, and battery were replaced. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The catalytic converter was repaired in 2023. Manufacturer’s literature, partial service records, and a tool kit will accompany the sale. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
