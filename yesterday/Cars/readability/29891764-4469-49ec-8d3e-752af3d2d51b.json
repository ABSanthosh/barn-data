The transaxle was rebuilt in 2021, and additional equipment includes a black canvas soft top, side curtains, a tonneau cover, a dual-outlet exhaust system, and bucket seats. This Speedster is now offered in Oceanside, California on dealer consignment with the stock engine and transaxle, a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, refurbishment records and photos, and a clean New Mexico title. The car was stripped to bare metal, mounted to a rotisserie, and repainted in metallic gray following the completion of body work, and a replacement black canvas top was installed at that time. The windshield was replaced in 2023. Features include a tonneau cover, removable side curtains, a driver-side mirror, fog lights, and body-color bumpers. Body-color 15″ Rudge knock-off wheels are mounted with 155SR15 Vredestein Sprint Classic tires. The car was factory equipped with drum brakes at each corner, and the brake system was upgraded by the selling dealer. The fixed-back bucket seats were reupholstered in red leather, and replacement door panels, carpets, and Coco floor mats were installed during the refurbishment. Latch-and-link lap belts and a fire extinguisher were added in 2024. The three-spoke banjo-style steering wheel frames instrumentation that was refurbished by Palo Alto Speedometer, including a 120-mph speedometer, a 6k-rpm tachometer, and an oil temperature gauge. The five-digit odometer was reset to zero during the refurbishment and now shows 566 miles. The replacement 1,720cc Porsche 912 flat-four was built by Precision Motion of Colton, California and installed in 2020. The dual Weber carburetors were rebuilt in 2022, and the electrical system has been converted to 12-volts. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a 356C-specification 741 four-speed manual transaxle. It was rebuilt in 2022 with replacement synchros, bearings, and gaskets, and a lightened flywheel was also installed. The dual-outlet exhaust system was repainted in 2024. The removed engine and transaxle accompany the vehicle, and engine stamping P*35285* is shown above, with a corresponding number listed on the CoA below. A photo of transaxle stamping 6426 is viewable in the gallery. The Porsche Certificate of Authenticity shows a production completion date of July 12, 1955 along with factory colors and powertrain numbers.
