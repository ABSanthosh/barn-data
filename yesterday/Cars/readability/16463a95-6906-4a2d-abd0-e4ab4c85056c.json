  "text": "This 2001 BMW Z8 is a triple-black example that was imported to the US from France in August 2005, acquired by the current owner in 2015, and listed on BaT in July 2023. The car is powered by a 4.9-liter S62 V8 paired with a six-speed manual transmission and features a color-matched removable hardtop, a black soft top, 18” split-spoke wheels, xenon headlights, heated power-adjustable sport seats, a six-disc CD changer, a Harman Kardon sound system, navigation, and air conditioning. Now showing 14k miles, this Z8 is now offered on dealer consignment with the owner’s manual, service records, spare parts, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Massachusetts title. The Z8 features bodywork designed by Henrik Fisker with inspiration from the BMW 507 roadster, and the aluminum body panels are mounted over an aluminum spaceframe. This example is finished in Jet Black and features a color-matched removable hardtop and a black soft top as well as xenon headlights with washers, front fender air extractors with BMW roundels, polished mirror caps, dual exhaust outlets, and two-tone neon taillights. The seller notes the headlights have been replaced. The 18” split-spoke wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport All Season 4 tires measuring 245/45 up front and 275/40 out back with 2022 production date codes. The right-rear wheel has a blemish. The four-wheel disc brake system is equipped with Dynamic Brake Control (DBC), and additional features include Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) and All-Season Traction (ASC). Black Nappa leather upholstery extends from the heated power-adjustable seats to the dashboard, center console, and door panels. Amenities include a six-disc CD changer, navigation, a Harman Kardon sound system, leather-wrapped roll hoops, air conditioning, a Motorola car phone, and cruise control. Blemishes are visible on the center console. The banjo-spoke steering wheel features silver trim within a leather-wrapped rim. Centrally mounted instrumentation consists of a 155-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer with an integrated analog clock, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 14k miles, approximately 2k of which were added under current ownership. The 4.9-liter S62 V8 was shared with the contemporary E39 M5 and features double-VANOS variable valve timing for a factory-rated output of 394 horsepower and 368 lb-ft torque. The selling dealer reports that the valve cover gaskets were replaced in May 2022, and a new battery was fitted in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transmission. The Carfax report notes no accidents or other damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
