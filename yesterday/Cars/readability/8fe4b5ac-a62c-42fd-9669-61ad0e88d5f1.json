  "description": "Nissan has released more details about the all-new Micra that debuted as a full-blown EV earlier this year, particularly surrounding the hatchback’s interior and powertrains. Underpinning this sixth generation of Micra is the same AmpR Small platform that the Renault 5 EV uses, marking the first time that the Nissan hatchback won’t have any ICE setup. 2025 Nissan Micra EV cabin has a dual-screen setup, ambient lighting, 326L boot, and more 40kWh and 52kWh battery packs to offer up to 308km and 408km range, respectively The hatchback will launch in global markets by late 2025 2025 Nissan Micra EV interior and features Centre console is driver-focused The new Micra’s dual-tone cabin has two 10.1-inch screens for infotainment and instrumentation purposes, with the centre console angled towards the driver and physical controls below the air vents.  Alongside features such as an electronic parking brake, wireless charging pad and 48-colour ambient lighting, the new-gen Micra has a couple of quirky Nissan-specific design touches, like unique upholstery and a moulded silhouette of Mount Fuji in the storage space between the seats. Speaking of storage, boot space is rated at 326 litres. 2025 Nissan Micra EV battery specs and range 40kWh and 52kWh battery pack options Nissan will offer two versions of the new Micra EV. The entry-level car comes with a 40kWh battery paired to a 122hp, 225Nm motor, delivering a WLTP-tested range of 308km. The top-spec Micra EV variant has a 52kWh battery pack powering a 150hp, 245Nm motor, extending the range to 408km. Larger battery offers support for 100kW DC fast charging The 52kWh variant supports 100kW DC fast charging, capable of topping up the battery from 15 to 80 percent in 30 minutes. Both Micra EV variants come with vehicle-to-load (V2L) functionality, a heat pump and battery temperature control systems. 2025 Nissan Micra EV exterior design Funky design language Heavily inspired by the Nissan 20-23 EV concept, the new-gen Micra features compact proportions (sub-4-metre length) and eye-catching styling flourishes, particularly the circular daytime running lights around its rectangular headlights, a gloss-black body cladding, a blacked-out roof and segmented circular tail-lamps. The hatchback also sports silver inserts in the front bumper and upper window line, 18-inch alloy wheels and column-mounted rear door handles. 2025 Nissan Micra EV launch details Launches later this year in Europe; India launch propects unclear The Micra EV will be manufactured at Renault’s Douai plant in France, with launch expected in late 2025 for European markets. Whether Nissan plans to bring the Micra EV to India is currently unconfirmed. The Japanese carmaker did sell the fourth-gen Micra here from 2010 to 2020, but as it stands, the only Nissan models confirmed to be India-bound are a new compact MPV based on the Renault Triber and a midsize SUV based on the upcoming Renault Duster.
