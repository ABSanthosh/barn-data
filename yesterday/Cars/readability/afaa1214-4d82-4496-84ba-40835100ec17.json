  "description": "Aston Martin has revealed that the sales split between its SUV and sports car models in India is currently about 50:50. This means the DBX alone sells as many units as Aston Martin’s entire sports car line-up, which includes the Vantage and DB12. The third-gen Vanquish recently joined this list, too. The Aston Martin DBX sells as much as the Vantage and DB12 combined in India Aston Martin plans to maintain this balance between its SUV and sports car offerings Porsche and Lamborghini sales also skew towards their SUV models Aston Martin SUV and sports car sales in India are evenly split Speaking with Autocar India during the launch of the new Vanquish, Gautam Dutta, general manager of Sales at Aston Martin India, reflected on the commercial performance of the brand's current model line-up. “It’s been a balance,” he said, adding that Aston Martin’s “performance-oriented” brand positioning has helped create “appreciation” for both its sports cars and the DBX. Dutta also remarked: “Last year, the DBX gave us phenomenal results, but the Vantage was also very helpful in generating a lot of traction for us. So, it’s a balance that we are nicely maintaining between the SUV and other sports cars.” When asked about the precise split between the models, Dutta narrowed it down to 50:50. SUV sales are booming for other high-profile carmakers as well The DBX’s success compared to other Aston Martin models isn’t surprising, given the high demand for SUVs in India. This trend also holds true for brands like Porsche and Lamborghini, which offer sports cars and SUVs in their model portfolios. Porsche India’s unit sales for 2024 skewed a whopping 71 percent in favour of the Cayenne and Macan, with the remaining 29 percent occupied by the 911, Panamera, Taycan, 718 Cayman, and Boxster. Meanwhile, Lamborghini India recorded a 60:40 sales split between the Urus and the Italian marque’s supercars offerings in 2022.
