  "text": "The GT350R is also back and it's packing supercharged power 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Shelby has introduced the 2025 GT350 and GT350R, which offer up to 830 hp. Production will be limited to 562 units and the supercharged GT350 will cost $109,999. Assembly will begin in the second quarter and U.S. sales will be through select Ford dealers. Shelby American has unveiled the 2025 GT350 at the Barrett-Jackson auction in Scottsdale, Arizona. Its introduction comes nearly 60 years after Carroll Shelby introduced the first one and it’s the most powerful GT350 in history. Starting under the hood, customers will find a familiar 5.0-liter V8 engine producing 480 hp (358 kW / 487 PS). However, most people will likely opt for the 3.0-liter Whipple supercharger upgrade, which increases the output to 810 hp (604 kW / 821 PS). Regardless of which engine is selected, they can be paired to automatic or manual transmissions with the latter featuring a short-throw shifter. More: The 1965 Shelby GT350 Saved The Mustang, Here’s All You Need To Know About It The upgrades extend beyond the engine compartment as the 2025 Shelby GT350 comes equipped with lowering springs, new sway bars, and a Borla cat-back exhaust. The model also rides on 20-inch forged alloy wheels that are wrapped in “Shelby spec performance tires.” While a number of Shelby American models aren’t exactly pretty, they’ve done a wonderful job this time around. Starting up front, there’s an aluminum deep draw hood and a three-piece front splitter. They’re joined by an aggressive grille insert and subtle Shelby badging. Further back, there’s a ducktail rear spoiler and Le Mans-style body stripes. The Mustang also has deep tinted windows, although that varies by state. Customers can also order options such as a rear wing and a carbon fiber package. The company only released a handful of interior pictures, but the cabin features leather seat covers with Shelby embroidery. They’re joined by embroidered floor mats, special door sill plates, and a serialized dash plaque. Models equipped with a manual transmission also sport a ball shifter. Production will apparently be limited to 526 units and they’ll be sold in the United States through select Ford dealers. A limited number of cars will also be offered internationally. Shelby didn’t release detailed pricing, but said the supercharged variant will start at $109,999 including the car. The Shelby GT350R Is Track-Ready And Street-Legal If the standard model is a little too tame, you can upgrade to the GT350R. It comes standard with a supercharged 5.0-liter V8 engine producing more than 830 hp (619 kW / 842 PS). Besides being more powerful, it’s available exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission. Given its track ambitions, the GT350R benefits from “optimized chassis stiffening” and a JRI suspension package. Customers will also find Alcon Racing brakes and Forge-line racing wheels that are painted in Gold Rush. The model also sports an aluminum hood with a carbon fiber vent. They’re joined by ventilated carbon fiber front fenders, a carbon fiber rear wing, and a carbon fiber rear diffuser. The interior appears to have a faux carbon fiber tub, which sounds like a strange addition. However, it’s not hard to argue with Sparco racing seats, a roll cage, and carbon fiber trim. The model also has four-point harnesses and an AiM Solo 2 lap timer. The GT350R will be built in Michigan by Turn Key Automotive and production will be limited to 36 units. All will be white, but Shelby will offer an assortment of stripe and graphic packages.",
