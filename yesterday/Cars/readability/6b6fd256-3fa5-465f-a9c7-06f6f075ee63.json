  "description": "This 1967 Shelby Mustang GT500 fastback is one of 2,048 examples produced for the model year and was completed on January 12, 1967. It was first delivered to Mel Burns Ford in Long Beach, California, and the car spent time with several owners in the state and was refurbished at some point under prior ownership. Power is provided by a 428ci Cobra Jet V8 linked with a three-speed automatic transmission. Work in 2024 included servicing the carburetors and replacing the shift shaft seal and fuel-sending unit. Finished in green with white stripes, the car is equipped with functional hood scoops, a rear spoiler, power-assisted front disc brakes, power steering, and 10-spoke 15″ wheels in addition to a folding rear bench seat, an AM radio, and a heater. This GT500 is now offered by the seller at no reserve with a Deluxe Marti Report, a Shelby Registry report, a spare set of wheels, spare parts, and a clean Arizona title in the name of the late owner's estate.",

Finished in green with white stripes, the car is equipped with functional hood scoops, a rear spoiler, power-assisted front disc brakes, power steering, and 10-spoke 15″ wheels in addition to a folding rear bench seat, an AM radio, and a heater. This GT500 is now offered by the seller at no reserve with a Deluxe Marti Report, a Shelby Registry report, a spare set of wheels, spare parts, and a clean Arizona title in the name of the late owner’s estate. The GT500 model was equipped with a ducktail rear spoiler, fender extensions, air scoops on the sail and quarter panels, and a fiberglass ventilated hood with a ram-air scoop. This example left the factory finished in Dark Moss Green (5) and was repainted at some point under prior ownership. Additional exterior details include dual white stripes and GT500 side stripes along with hood lock cables, inboard grille-mounted driving lamps, and dual exhaust outlets. The 10-spoke 15″ wheels wear Shelby Cobra center caps and are mounted with BFGoodrich Radial T/A tires. GT500 models were outfitted with an upgraded suspension system with heavy-duty coil springs and an anti-roll bar up front in addition to heavy-duty leaf springs out back. Stopping is provided by power-assisted front discs and rear drums. Work in June 2024 involved replacing a power steering hose and changing the power steering fluid, installing a stabilizer bar link kit, and replacing suspension bushings. The cabin features front bucket seats and a folding Sport Deck rear seat trimmed in black vinyl. A fire extinguisher is secured to the roll bar, and interior appointments include an AM radio, front seat shoulder harnesses, rear seat lap belts, and a heater. Pitting on interior trim pieces is noted. The three-spoke woodgrain steering wheel fronts a 140-mph speedometer and an 8k-rpm tachometer as well as auxiliary gauges, while Stewart Warner readouts for oil pressure and amperage are located below the dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows 31k miles. The 428ci Cobra Jet V8 was factory equipped with dual four-barrel Holley carburetors and was rated at 335 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. It was overhauled in 2018, and work in 2024 involved servicing the carburetors and replacing the fuel-sending unit. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission. The shift shaft seal was replaced and the transmission fluid was changed in June 2024. The Deluxe Marti Report displays a January 12, 1967 build date and lists factory colors and equipment along with production statistics. The Shelby Registry Report is included in the sale along with copies of factory documentation, which are shown in the gallery below. A set of five-spoke Magstar-style wheels with tires is included in the sale. The vehicle is being offered on behalf of an estate. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
