  "text": "Published:  December 30th, 2024 We had not one but two stories about hacking and mishandled data today. One story was about in-car data being exposed, and the other was about an automaker's social-media account being hacked. Obviously the social-media hack isn't related to cars, beyond being aimed at an automaker's account, but it's not like we haven't covered car hacking a lot. I even asked a similar, though not the same, QOTD on this subject in September. So, I am going to take your temperature on this subject yet again -- how worried are you about having your car hacked? Or about an OEM exposing your data through onboard software?You know what to do. Sound off below.[Image: Bogdan Cherniak/Shutterstock.com]Become a TTAC insider.

Tim Healey Tim Healey grew up around the auto-parts business and has always had a love for cars — his parents joke his first word was “‘Vette”. Despite this, he wanted to pursue a career in sports writing but he ended up falling semi-accidentally into the automotive-journalism industry, first at Consumer Guide Automotive and later at Web2Carz.com. He also worked as an industry analyst at Mintel Group and freelanced for About.com, CarFax, Vehix.com, High Gear Media, Torque News, FutureCar.com, Cars.com, among others, and of course Vertical Scope sites such as AutoGuide.com, Off-Road.com, and HybridCars.com. He’s an urbanite and as such, doesn’t need a daily driver, but if he had one, it would be compact, sporty, and have a manual transmission. More by Tim Healey Published December 30th, 2024 6:01 PM Comments Join the conversation I own a 2013 Charger, have no smarty pants phone and have not knowingly used/signed up for any type of 'trinkets' that connect my car to anything other than the road surface. I'm sure there are possible vulnerabilities, but my guess is they receive minimal data. I'm sure someone will correct me on that which I would appreciate actually. I wouldn’t trust any automaker as far as I could throw them with my personal information. I do my best - including having the TCU in my Mazda turned off and refusing any and all of Mazda’s Connected Services. But I know it isn’t enough. We need legislation from Congress but good luck with that.",
