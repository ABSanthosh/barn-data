  "description": "Fresh spy shots of the BMW F 450 GS, which TVS will manufacture, have emerged on the internet ahead of its impending launch in late 2025. These spy shots feature a test mule that appears to be very close to the production-spec bike.  BMW F 450 GS appears to run on 19/17-inch alloys Its new headlight design is reminiscent of the big 1300 GS The bike gets a big colour TFT display, just like big BMW models BMW F 450 fresh details emerge F 450 GS appears to be a road-biased ADV The F 450 GS will be the entry point to the BMW GS family when it launches, and from the latest spy shots, it is clear that it will be a slim machine. The single front disc brake is another sign that the motorcycle will be lightweight, at least in its class. The headlight design is quite reminiscent of the big R 1300 GS, especially in the X-shaped headlight daytime running lamp. However, one must note that the main headlight unit comprises a stacked LED light setup, unlike the single light seen on the 1300.  This particular BMW F 450 GS is decked out with some accessories, such as a top box, a bash plate, knuckle guards and some crash protection. The bike is seen running on alloy wheels (likely to be 19/17-inchers, F/R) with road-biased dual-purpose tyres. The company could offer spoked wheels as an accessory. The riding triangle seems quite spacious and neutral, both typical ADV traits.  The BMW F 450 GS is slated to launch in India at the end of the year, and we expect its ex-showroom price to be around Rs 5 lakh. This small GS will rival the Honda NX500 and CFMoto 450 MT.  Image Source: motorradonline.de Also See: Norton V4 superbike India launch this year",
