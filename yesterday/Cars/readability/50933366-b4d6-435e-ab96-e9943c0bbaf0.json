Powered by a 6.5-liter V12 linked to a seven-speed ISR automated manual transmission and a Haldex all-wheel-drive system, the car is equipped with a RYFT exhaust system, carbon-ceramic brakes, 20″ and 21″ Leirion forged wheels, a suspension lift system, power-adjustable heated seats, a dash cam, a Sensonum sound system, and carbon-fiber interior and exterior trim. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2025, this LP780-4 Ultimae has 4,800 miles and is now offered in Florida with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Texas title. The Ultimae edition was announced in July 2021 as the final version of the Aventador. Production was limited to 350 coupes and 250 roadsters, although an additional 15 cars were produced by Lamborghini in response to the sinking of a cargo vessel in March 2022. This example is finished in Verde Scandal and features a carbon-fiber roof panel, parking sensors, bi-xenon headlights with washers, rear fog lights, heated and power-folding mirrors, and the Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva 2.0 active front air intake and aero-channel system. Paint protection film has been applied to the exterior, per the seller. Forged 20″ and 21″ Leirion wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires. The car is equipped with magnetic push-rod suspension, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), and a front-axle suspension lift system. Stopping power is provided by multi-piston calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners. The cockpit is trimmed in Nero Ade and Verde Fauns upholstery with contrast stitching covering the seats, dashboard, and center console. Features include power-adjustable heated seats, carbon-fiber door panels and trim, an Ultimae plaque near the A-pillar, a Lamborghini infotainment system, a CD stereo, a Lamborghini Sensonum sound system, and automatic climate control. The leather- and Alcantara-wrapped multi-function steering wheel frames a TFT LCD digital gauge cluster with a variable-redline tachometer, speed and fuel readouts, and auxiliary gauges for oil temperature and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 4,800 miles. The 6.5-liter V12 was fitted with titanium intake valves in Ultimae specification to achieve a factory-rated output of 769 horsepower and 531 lb-ft of torque. A carbon-fiber X-brace and T-engine cover as well as a transparent glass engine-bay cover were optioned from the factory. Power is sent to all four wheels through a seven-speed single-clutch ISR automated manual transmission and a Haldex all-wheel-drive system with a limited-slip rear differential. The car has been fitted with a RYFT exhaust system, and the removed catalytic converters are included in the sale. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Gold Coast Exotic Imports of Chicago, Illinois, along with factory colors, equipment, options, and a total suggested retail price of $584,753.
