  "description": "Hero MotoCorp has recently faced turbulence in its sales numbers and market share. Part of the problem is that its overarching success lies in the 100-110cc commuter bike category, which has seen a declining trend in recent years. The other part is that none of its more recent, premium products – except for the Xtreme 125R – have set the sales charts on fire. The company is seeking to replicate that sort of success in the premium 125cc scooter segment as well, and the all-new Destini 125 is its first tool at chipping into that space. So, can this revamped Destini 125 help Hero on its journey towards a more premium identity? Hero Destini 125 design and features - 7/10 Has the basics covered but is lacking in some crucial areas The Destini 125 has a typical family scooter look (for the most part), with pleasing lines and a safe design. This holds true when you see the scooter from the front, but as your eyes snake their way to the back, you’ll notice that Hero has gone down an unconventional route when it comes to the tail-lamp and rear indicators. The tail-lamp is shaped like the letter H – an increasingly common signature across Hero products – and the turn signals are stacked on top of it. While there is no functional problem, this is a polarising design choice in a segment dominated by inoffensive designs.  Hero Destini 125 key specificationsHero Destini 125Kerb Weight115kgSeat Height770mmGround Clearance162mmFuel Tank capacity5.3 litresWheelbase1302mm A concealed fuel filler cap is an improvement, but the space to get your fingers around the cap is a little tight. Fit and finish is one area where Hero still has some ways to go. The indicator and horn buttons feel quite plasticky, the cover for the USB charging port feels flimsy, and the fuel filler lid’s panel doesn’t sit flush on the left side. Speaking of the fuel filler, the empty space around the lid is a little tight for those with larger hands, and tightening the cap once you’ve refuelled takes a little dexterity.  Lack of a brake lock clasp is a crucial miss on a gearless scooter; parking on a slope will necessitate some caution. It also misses out on a brake lock clasp, which is a must-have on a gearless scooter. The mirrors, while well-shaped, have rather short stalks, which means a quarter of your rear view is obstructed by your elbow. Another area where the Destini lags behind its rivals is storage capacity. While it has the basics covered, with a luggage hook on the front apron and a spacious cubby that can fit a 1-litre water bottle, its 19-litre underseat storage area is quite small. This is especially true in comparison to the TVS Jupiter models, which offer class-leading levels of boot space in the ICE scooter game.  A boot light is a nice feature to have, but the 19-litre underseat storage area is one of the smallest in this class. That’s not to say it’s devoid of features, and in addition to a side-stand cutoff, auto-cancelling indicators, a boot light, and a USB charger, you also have the option to pair your smartphone with the display. Once paired, you can receive turn-by-turn navigation prompts, as well as call and SMS alerts. While all of this is nice to have, the display has its oddities. For instance, the odometer and clock are hard to tell apart at a quick glance, and, on a sunny day, even at full brightness, the smaller digits on the screen are hard to make out. The digital LCD screen has some good features like turn-by-turn navigation, although it could be a little brighter. Hero Destini 125 ride and handling - 8/10 Overall comfort levels are quite high; it is a predictable handler One area where the Destini is a rather accomplished machine is in its ride comfort. The generously padded seat, spacious ergonomics, and plush suspension setup work together to make the Destini one of the most comfortable scooters around. We recently tested the newest Suzuki Access and TVS Jupiter 110, so with that fresh in our minds, we can report back that the suspension and seat comfort on the Destini feel superior to those of the aforementioned scooters.   Hero Destini 125 underpinningsHero Destini 125Suspension (F/R)Telescopic fork / MonoshockBrakes (F/R)Disc / DrumTyres (F/R)90/90-12 / 100/80-12 The suspension absorbs most of what comes in the way very well and is among the best in this segment. With 12-inch wheels at both ends, the Destini is a sure-footed machine even at higher speeds, and the larger rear wheel also helps to some extent when going over bigger bumps. Being a family scooter, the Destini makes no pretences of being an energetic handler, and it prioritises stability over flickability.  Stopping performance is commensurate with rivals and the CBS works well, but the brakes are devoid of feel. As with other offerings in the class, the Destini gets combi-brakes, and while there is sufficient stopping power to be had, the brakes felt devoid of feel and always necessitated a firm pull when coming to a halt. Hero Destini 125 performance and fuel economy - 7/10 Fuel efficiency and performance are commendable, but refinement could improve At the first ride event last year, Hero told us that while the latest Destini uses the same engine block as the previous-gen model, the company had gone to great lengths to improve refinement, mileage, and reliability over a longer duration. While it has succeeded in some areas, there’s still some work to be done.  Hero Destini 125 performanceAcceleration0-40kph3.8s0-80kph16.07sRoll-on acceleration20-50kph4.97s30-70kph10.86s50-80kph10.62sBraking 60-0kph (in metres)18.53m We’ll begin with the positives. The Destini’s motor is quite punchy, and if you want to make a quick overtake in city traffic, a small to moderate throttle opening will get the job done. If your commute includes fast, flowing roads – like in Indian metro cities – the Destini can hold a 70kph cruise as well.  The 124.6cc engine is decently punchy and rather efficient, but its refinement levels could be better. Fuel economy is a big factor when purchasing a vehicle like this, and the Destini ticks that box nicely. In our tests, the scooter managed to deliver 58kpl (overall), which is quite close to Hero’s claim of 60kpl. A couple of factors are at play here. First, the engine’s punchy nature means you don’t need to wring its neck when making progress, thereby reducing wide-open throttle openings and aiding fuel economy. Second, Hero’s i3s start/stop tech cuts the engine off when you’re idling at a stoplight and helps save fuel.  With its wide and generously padded seat, plush suspension setup and neutral ergos, the Destini is one of the most comfortable scooters in its class. While the i3s system undoubtedly aids fuel efficiency, its execution has left us wanting. The procedure to restart the engine is to keep either brake lever pressed and hold the accelerator open until the engine turns over. All of this takes about 2-3 seconds, which may not sound like a lot, but after experiencing Suzuki and Yamaha’s seamless start/stop systems, Hero’s i3s feels slow-witted and cumbersome in impatient big-city traffic. Then there is also the fact that the Destini’s engine is considerably behind our refinement benchmark – the Suzuki Access – with a mild buzz felt at the handlebar and floorboard at various speeds.  Mirrors are well-shaped and smooth throughout, but the stalks are a little short; elbow obstructs the rear view. What was a more troubling issue was that our scooter’s engine started making a metallic rattling sound a few days into its 2-week stint with us. This occurrence would present itself when accelerating with a wide-open throttle from a standstill or from speeds under 20kph, and it would continue for a few seconds. This noise didn’t affect the performance of the scooter at all, but it was disconcerting nonetheless, especially on a vehicle that had barely crossed the 8,000km mark. We have reached out to Hero and will update the web version of this story once we discover what the issue was. Hero Destini 125 price and verdict - 7/10 It is now a better scooter, but still some distance away from the best in class In our time with it, we’ve discovered that the Destini 125 has strengths and weaknesses that are common across most Hero products. It is exceptionally comfortable, rather frugal, and backed by the company’s extensive retail sales network. At the same time, weaknesses such as fit and finish that leaves you wanting, and a lacklustre engine sour this package, especially now that the 125cc scooter class has some seriously impressive competitors.  The i3s start-stop system could be quicker in its operation. Ranging between Rs 81,850 and Rs 91,700 (ex-showroom, Delhi), it is priced on par with its rivals and doesn’t have the upper hand there either. Comfort and frugality are two big factors people look for in a scooter, and the Destini has those areas covered, but its shortcomings are enough to prevent it from rising to the top of the class.

The Destini’s motor is quite punchy, and if you want to make a quick overtake in city traffic, a small to moderate throttle opening will get the job done. If your commute includes fast, flowing roads – like in Indian metro cities – the Destini can hold a 70kph cruise as well. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Hero Destini 125 engine\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Hero Destini 125 engine.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\" title=\"Hero Destini 125 engine\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe 124.6cc engine is decently punchy and rather efficient, but its refinement levels could be better.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-94d18440-7fff-b23c-7e65-4b77e1a9b825\"\u003eFuel economy is a big factor when purchasing a vehicle like this, and the Destini ticks that box nicely. In our tests, the scooter managed to deliver 58kpl (overall), which is quite close to Hero’s claim of 60kpl. A couple of factors are at play here. First, the engine’s punchy nature means you don’t need to wring its neck when making progress, thereby reducing wide-open throttle openings and aiding fuel economy. Second, Hero’s i3s start/stop tech cuts the engine off when you’re idling at a stoplight and helps save fuel. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Hero Destini 125 right profile riding shot\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Hero Destini 125 right profile riding shot.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\" title=\"Hero Destini 125 right profile riding shot\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWith its wide and generously padded seat, plush suspension setup and neutral ergos, the Destini is one of the most comfortable scooters in its class.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-94d18440-7fff-b23c-7e65-4b77e1a9b825\"\u003eWhile the i3s system undoubtedly aids fuel efficiency, its execution has left us wanting. The procedure to restart the engine is to keep either brake lever pressed and hold the accelerator open until the engine turns over. All of this takes about 2-3 seconds, which may not sound like a lot, but after experiencing Suzuki and Yamaha’s seamless start/stop systems, Hero’s i3s feels slow-witted and cumbersome in impatient big-city traffic. Then there is also the fact that the Destini’s engine is considerably behind our refinement benchmark – the Suzuki Access – with a mild buzz felt at the handlebar and floorboard at various speeds. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Hero Destini 125 right mirror\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Hero Destini 125 right mirror.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\" title=\"Hero Destini 125 right mirror\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMirrors are well-shaped and smooth throughout, but the stalks are a little short; elbow obstructs the rear view.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-94d18440-7fff-b23c-7e65-4b77e1a9b825\"\u003eWhat was a more troubling issue was that our scooter’s engine started making a metallic rattling sound a few days into its 2-week stint with us. This occurrence would present itself when accelerating with a wide-open throttle from a standstill or from speeds under 20kph, and it would continue for a few seconds. This noise didn’t affect the performance of the scooter at all, but it was disconcerting nonetheless, especially on a vehicle that had barely crossed the 8,000km mark.
