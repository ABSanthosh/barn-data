  "description": "This 2000 Ferrari 360 Modena was produced for the European market prior to being imported to the US in 2000, and it underwent a refurbishment in 2020 that included refinishing multiple body panels, headlight bezels, and valve covers in addition to performing a timing belt service and replacing the camshaft variators, clutch, exhaust headers, engine and transaxle mounts, and the F1 pump, accumulator, and relay. Finished in Rosso Corsa over Nero leather upholstery, it is powered by a 3.6-liter V8 paired with a six-speed F1 sequential transaxle. The car has 29k miles and is further equipped with a Challenge rear grille, 19\" Challenge alloy wheels, a CD stereo, a Challenge exhaust system, and automatic climate control. This 360 Modena was purchased by the owner in 2021 and is now offered with the owner's manual, a tool kit, partial service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Kansas title in the current owner's name.",

Finished in Rosso Corsa over Nero leather upholstery, it is powered by a 3.6-liter V8 paired with a six-speed F1 sequential transaxle. The car has 29k miles and is further equipped with a Challenge rear grille, 19″ Challenge alloy wheels, a CD stereo, a Challenge exhaust system, and automatic climate control. This 360 Modena was purchased by the owner in 2021 and is now offered with the owner’s manual, a tool kit, partial service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Kansas title in the current owner’s name. The Pininfarina-designed aluminum body was not fitted with side markers in European configuration, and it is finished in Rosso Corsa. Additional details include xenon headlights, a Challenge rear grille, and quad exhaust outlets exiting through the rear fascia. The bumper covers, rocker panels, rear grille, fenders, hood, and headlights bezels were refinished in November 2020 due to rock chips and imperfections, at which time the headlight lenses were repaired. Blemishes are noted on the underside. The 19″ Challenge alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin tires. Stopping power is from black-finished Ferrari-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors at each corner. A power steering leak was repaired in May 2024. The cockpit features seats upholstered in Nero leather along with a color-coordinated dashboard, door panel, and carpets. Ferrari-branded floor mats line the footwells, and additional appointments include a CD stereo, aluminum pedals, and automatic climate control. The air conditioning refrigerant was recharged in May 2024. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 220-mph speedometer and a tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as a digital fuel level readout and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, and coolant temperature. Paddle shifters for the F1 gearbox are mounted behind the steering wheel. The digital odometer indicates 29k miles, approximately 500 of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 3.6-liter Tipo F131 V8 features a flat-plane crankshaft, dry-sump lubrication, dual overhead camshafts, and five valves per cylinder. Factory-rated output was 400 horsepower in European configuration. Work in November 2020 included refinishing the valve covers as well as performing a timing belt service and replacing the camshaft variators, clutch, exhaust headers, engine and transaxle mounts, and the F1 pump, accumulator, and relay. An oil change was performed in May 2024, at which time the coolant cap was replaced and a gearbox leak was repaired. Power is sent to the rear wheels through an electrohydraulic six-speed F1 sequential transaxle and a limited-slip differential. A Challenge exhaust system has been fitted, and the seller states the car is not equipped with catalytic converters. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. A May 2001 entry states a bond was released and the vehicle was “declared to meet US highway safety specifications.” The current Kansas is listed as a replacement.
