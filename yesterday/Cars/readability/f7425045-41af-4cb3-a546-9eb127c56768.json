  "description": "How good is the Suzuki eVitara in reality? Its Toyota twin has the answer It’s not déjà vu – it’s the new Toyota Urban Cruiser. If this smaller sibling of the bZ4X looks familiar, it’s because we recently drove the Suzuki eVitara, which is essentially the same car.Toyota and Suzuki are all in on the not-so-noble art of badge engineering. It’s been a few years since Suzuki started selling the Corolla estate and RAV4 as the Swace and Across, so now it’s Suzuki’s turn to return the favour.The name Urban Cruiser itself might ring a bell. Back in 2008, Toyota applied it to an uninspiring, taller version of the Yaris. In a way, it was ahead of its time, because B-segment crossovers (like the Yaris Cross) are now wildly popular, yet it failed to leave much of a mark. Toyota will be hoping this new electric one can do better.",

GoodPleasing, middle-of-the-road ride-handling balanceSmooth power delivery and regenStrong warrantyBadInterior feels cheap and is not very spaciousMediocre EV credentialsWe've not seen a touchscreen this slow for a long time It remains to be seen whether those prices will be mirrored in the UK. Even if they are, the Urban Cruiser won’t be spectacularly cheap. Even though this new Urban Cruiser shares nothing with the one from 15 years ago, it feels destined to be similarly insignificant. Wading into battle with a cheap-feeling and not especially roomy interior, dated infotainment and middling EV credentials, it will face an uphill battle that it can’t win by just being quite nice to drive.

He loves cars that are fun and usable on the road – whether piston-powered or electric – or just cars that are very fit for purpose. When not in test cars, he drives an R53-generation Mini Cooper S.
