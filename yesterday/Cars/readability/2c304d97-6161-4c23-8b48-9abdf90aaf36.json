  "description": "The crossover joins the larger 7 as the second car in Chery-owned Jaecoo's line-up The Range Rover Evoque-rivalling Jaecoo 5 will go on sale this year – and it will make its UK debut at next week’s Goodwood Festival of Speed. The crossover will be the second car in the Chery-owned Jaecoo line-up, joining the larger Jaecoo 7, a car that has quickly gained popularity here after amassing almost 6000 sales since it went on sale at the start of the year.  The Jaecoo 5 is based on the same T1X platform as its stablemate, as well as sibling brand Omoda’s similarly named 5, 7, 9 and recently revealed 3 – the 3 being its most closely related cousin. Unusually, the Jaecoo 5 will not be launched first with an electric or electrified powertrain. Instead, it will be powered by a 1.6-litre turbocharged petrol engine. While exact technical details have yet to be confirmed, its state of tune is likely to match the same capacity unit in the Omoda 5: 187bhp, 203lb ft, and paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. Visually, the Jaecoo 5 is a shrunken version of the 7, with near-identical front and rear end designs, but with a shorter wheelbase and a more raked roofline.   Inside, however, the 5 receives a smaller infotainment screen (its exact size has not yet been disclosed) than the 7’s 14.8in unit, and the larger car’s 10.25in floating driver’s display has been replaced by a screen housed within the dashboard. The 5 will be sold in two trim levels: Pure and Luxury. Entry-level equipment includes a six-speaker audio system, six-way adjustable seats, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Luxury trim adds a panoramic roof, wireless phone charging, and heated and ventilated front seats. Further details, including pricing, exact delivery dates and complete technical spec, will be revealed next week.",
