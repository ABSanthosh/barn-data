  "description": "New EVs are arriving thick and fast. Here's your guide to this year's entrants Like them or loathe them, electric cars are here to stay – and 2025 is looking to be their biggest year yet, with several major new models arriving on the market.  EV ownership is growing fast in the UK. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a record number were sold in 2024. Of the 1.95 million cars sold in 2024, 19.6% were electric - an increase of 16.5% year-on-year.  We’re expecting huge arrivals from established car makers – including Renault, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Hyundai and Tesla – while newcomers such as BYD, Leapmotor and Xpeng fill their arsenals.  These range from your everyday electric hatchback to big electric seven-seaters. There’s also a host of electric sports cars to look forward to and even the odd electric supermini.  Let’s get straight into it, then. From Abarth to Xpeng, here’s every new EV coming in 2025.  Abarth 600e Performance version of Fiat's new small crossover gets up to 276bhp from a single motor, which should propel it from 0-62mph in 5.9sec. Some will feel let down by its range, though, with its 54kWh battery offering just 207 miles. Read our Abarth 600e review AC Ace Electric Classic British roadster is going electric, with a lightweight design (it comes in at just 1134kg), a 72kWh battery and a 300bhp electric motor. It will cost you around £212,000, however. Read more about the new AC Ace Electric Alpine A390 The first crossover to come from this French performance brand, the A390 will feature a tri-motor powertrain with active torque-vectoring, which is promised to make it feel far lighter than it actually is. Expect a price tag just below £100,000.  Read more about the Alpine A390 Audi RS6 E-tron Audi Sport’s incoming performance saloon/estate will display some serious performance, rivalling the likes of the Porsche Taycan Turbo S and Tesla Model S Plaid. That’s all while offering the practicality of the regular A6 E-tron.  Read more about the Audi RS6 E-tron BMW iX facelift More power and range are the order of the day for BMW’s large electric SUV. Expect increases of around 10% in both departments, which should push the controversially styled iX past 400 miles of range and around 520bhp.  Read more about the BMW iX facelift BMW iX3 Neue Klasse This SUV is the first step into BMW's 'new-class' design revolution. We’ve no performance or range figures yet, but we know it will be equipped with 800V electrical hardware, which will make it one of the fastest-charging EVs on sale.  Read more about the BMW iX Neue Klasse BYD Atto 2 Another electric compact crossover, this time from Chinese giant BYD. This Vauxhall Frontera rival gets a single motor with 174bhp and a 45.1kWh battery, which produces around 194 miles of range. Inside, the Atto 2 offers seating for five and a 400-litre boot. Read our BYD Atto 2 review BYD Seagull The Seagull will be one of the smallest EVs on sale when it arrives later this year, as well as one of the cheapest: it could cost as little as £7730. UK specifications are unconfirmed, but range should stand at around 250 miles. Read more about the BYD Seagull BYD Seal update Technology and efficiency updates arrive for the Seal saloon, which gets a slightly smaller battery for a range of 320 miles. Updates to the interior include a new steering wheel and more upmarket materials, although the powertrains remain the same.  Read more about the BYD Seal facelift BYD Sealion 7 The SUV version of the Seal saloon gets some fairly powerful powertrains, including a 523bhp one with four-wheel drive. Despite a sizeable 91.3kWh battery, it will manage only around 312 miles on a change.  Read our BYD Sealion 7 review Cupra Raval This all-new small EV will sit below the Born in Cupra's line-up, with a reasonable price tag of below £20,000. Performance and range are to be confirmed, but the hatchback is rumoured to produce around 231bhp and have a range of circa 273 miles. Read more about the Cupra Raval Denza Z9 GT BYD-owned Denza hopes its upmarket Z9 GT will challenge stalwarts BMW and Audi. In its most powerful specification, this saloon/shooting brake will pump out 952bhp and 1018lb ft of torque. 0-62mph? Just 2.9sec…  Read more about the Denza Z9 GT Fiat Grande Panda Fiat’s latest retro-inspired small car will cost less than £22,000 in both electric and hybrid guises. The EV will get a 44kWh battery and a 111bhp electric motor, producing somewhere in the region of 199 miles.  Read our Fiat Grande Panda review Ford Puma Gen-E Ford has electrified its best-selling model, the Puma compact crossover, with a 43kWh battery and 234 miles of range. A single front-mounted motor supplies 166bhp, 214lb ft of torque and a 0-62mph sprint time of around 8.0sec.  Read more about the Ford Puma Gen-E Genesis GV60 Magma This more upmarket alternative to the hot Hyundai Ioniq 5 N will adopt similar underpinnings, such as its 89kWh battery and 641bhp dual-motor powertrain. Its chief development manager said it's tailored for “the gentleman driver” but encourages driving in “an exciting, enthusiastic way.” Read more about the Genesis GV60 Magma GWM Ora 07 The Ora 07 is a saloon counterpart to the Ora 03 supermini (formerly the Ora Funky Cat), with a price expected to land below £35,000. In its most premium specification, drivers can expect 354 miles of range and crazy performance, with 402bhp from two motors. Read our GWM Ora 07 prototype review Hyundai Inster The £22,715 Inster is the first electric supermini from Hyundai. A heat pump, four seats and dual 10.25in dashboard screens are standard, in addition to a reversing camera and blindspot monitoring. A range of 223 miles can be extracted from its 49kWh battery.  Read our Hyundai Inster review Hyundai Ioniq 6 N Based on the success of the Ioniq 5 N, we’re expecting big things from the Ioniq 6 N sports saloon. It’s expected to use an 86kWh battery and dual electric motors for four-wheel drive, but its performance is the juiciest part: 641bhp and 549lb ft. We can’t wait.  Read more about the Hyundai Ioniq 6 N Hyundai Ioniq 9 Closely related to the Kia EV9, the Ioniq 9 comes with seven seats and a flood of technology, topping the Ioniq EV range in the process. The entry-level Long Range RWD model uses a single 215bhp motor, giving it an official range just shy of 400 miles. Read our Hyundai Ioniq 9 review Jeep Compass Electric Set to receive both petrol and electric power, the next-generation Compass will go into production in Italy later this year. It will get a 207bhp electric motor and a 73kWh battery pack, sitting just above the Avenger in the Jeep line-up.  Read more about the electric Jeep Compass Jeep Wagoneer S Jeep’s new flagship will offer incredible performance in the body of a rugged off-roader, with a claimed output of 592bhp and 516lb ft. Four-wheel drive comes from two motors, and 0-62mph will take just 3.4sec. Range is said to stand at over 300 miles. Read more about the Jeep Wagoneer S KGM 0100 The brand formerly known as Ssangyong's next pick-up truck will be an EV using mechanicals supplied by China’s BYD. Much of the hardware is shared with the Torres eVX SUV, including a choice of 73.4kWh and 80.1kWh batteries. No word on payload capacity, though. Read more about the KGM 0100  Kia EV4 Kia isn’t just relying on SUVs in 2025: its EV4 will breathe new life in the saloon class, rivalling the venerable Tesla Model 3. Versions coming to the UK will be offered with 215bhp front-wheel-drive and 320bhp four-wheel-drive powertrains.  Read more about the Kia EV4 Kia EV5 Effectively an electric Sportage, the EV5 follows the introduction of the seven-seat EV9 and compact EV3 crossovers. Battery sizes stretch from 58kWh to 88kWh and Kia says the biggest-battery model can offer 403 miles of range.  Read more about the Kia EV5 Kia EV9 GT The EV9 GT will be one of the fastest seven-seaters in the world, capable of hitting 0-62mph in just 4.3sec. Total power output stands at 501bhp, but it’s still to be revealed how this outrageous performance will impact the EV9's range.  Read more about the Kia EV9 GT Kia PV5 Kia’s entry into the commercial vehicle market will start with the 4.7m-long PV5. Based on a highly configurable platform, it will initially be launched as a cargo van and a seven-seat MPV, before a pick-up variant and an autonomous taxi arrive later down the line.  Read more about the Kia PV5 Leapmotor B10 Stellantis-backed Chinese car firm Leapmotor unwrapped this compact crossover at the 2024 Paris motor show, but we’re still awaiting battery and power figures. It should borrow from the larger Leapmotor C10 but come in even cheaper, at under £30,000.  Read more about the Leapmotor B10 EVC L380 London taxi maker LEVC has unveiled an eight-seat MPV with an interior inspired by luxury airline travel. It will come with a 268bhp electric motor plus a maximum battery size of 120kWh, so you can ferry people around for up to 432 miles.  Read more about the LEVC L380 Maxus Mifa 7 MG's commercial sibling brand is following its huge Mifa 9 with a smaller MPV to rival the Volkswagen ID Buzz LWB. Seemingly styled after a laptop, it has seven seats and a 255-mile range.. Read more about Maxus EVs Mercedes-Benz CLA The next-generation CLA has officially been unveiled as Europe's longest range electric car. It's set to be the most efficient EV too, with a claimed 492-mile range and an efficiency figure north of 5.0mpkWh. Read more about the new electric Mercedes CLA Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 AMG's patented axial-flux motors were supposed to be confined to the company's more expensive models. But the hot version of the CLA will get them too. Which means this super slippery efficiency-oriented EV will get 500bhp+ and an active aero package with an air brake. Everything we know about the Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 MG Cyberster GTS MG surprised us all when it announced a 2+2 coupé version of its recently launched Cyberster roadster. It's likely to carry the same battery and motors as the standard Cyberster but will feel more like an MG B than an MG F.  Read our MG Cyberster review MG ES5 The arrival of the ES5 would suggest the existing ZS EV isn’t long for this world. It’s based on the platform of the smaller MG 4 hatchback, which will contain what is claimed to be the world’s thinnest EV battery. Read more about the MG ES5 Nissan Leaf Sunderland is getting ready for production of the Mk3 Nissan Leaf, which has transformed from hatchback to crossover. It’s likely to use similar underpinnings to the Renault Scenic, which has 60kWh and 87kWh batteries for up to 379 miles of range.  Read more about the new Nissan Leaf Nissan Micra The reborn Micra supermini will take the underpinnings of the much-celebrated new Renault 5. The design and engineering work will be completed in the UK and we’ve been told to expect a “sporty urban” car.  Read more about the new electric Nissan Micra Onvo L60 Nio’s affordable EV brand, Onvo, will launch in Europe with the L60, an electric coupé-SUV that's claimed to be the most aerodynamically efficient EV on the market. It will offer a choice of proven BYD batteries, but range figures haven't yet been published. Read more about the Onvo L60 Peugeot e-408 Electric power comes to Peugeot’s stylish coupé-SUV. A 59.2kWh battery supplies power to a 207bhp motor and produces a range of 281 miles. Prices have already been announced, starting at £42,175 for the basic Allure model and rising to £44,945 for the GT.  Read more about the Peugeot e-408 Polestar 3 Single Motor Swedish brand Polestar’s biggest car drops a motor to gain extra range for a lower price. The 3 is based on the same platform as the Volvo EX90, so it should offer similar range and performance.  Read our Polestar 3 review Polestar 5 The Porsche Taycan won’t be sleeping easy with the 5 on its tail. That’s if its charging statistics are anything to go by. Polestar says the saloon's new tech means it can gain 100 miles' worth of charge in just five minutes while avoiding battery degradation. Read more about the Polestar 5 Range Rover Electric The Range Rover Electric might be the year’s most anticipated EV, with superb off-road ability and class-leading comfort expected. Technical details are still under wraps, but we’ve been told it should offer performance comparable to the V8-engined Range Rover. Read more about the Range Rover Electric Renault 4 This crossover sibling of the Renault 5 uses a 118bhp front-mounted motor and a 40kWh battery for 190 miles of range in entry-level form, or buyers can opt for a 148bhp motor and a 52kWh battery for 250 miles of range. Read more about the new Renualt 4 Skoda Elroq The second EV to join Skoda’s model range comes in the form of a well-rounded SUV with a £31,500 price tag. It should prove to be decent value for money, with 360 miles of range, charging speeds of 145kW and a well-rounded drive.  Read our Skoda Elroq review Skoda Enyaq facelift A sleek styling update means the Enyaq should remain competitive in the world of long-range electric SUVs. Its new face includes updated LED headlights, while aerodynamic improvements have bolstered its range by a single mile, from 358 to 359.  Read more about the new Skoda Enyaq Skywell Q The follow-up to Chinese EV maker Skywell's BE11 crossover, the Q hatchback claims a range of more than 300 miles. Power is punchy, at 201bhp, with a claimed 0-62mph sprint time of 3.9sec.  Read more about the Skywell Q hatchback Skywell Skyhome This Chinese limousine will look to upset the Mercedes-Benz EQS with sumptuous luxury. Aside from a roof-mounted TV, we don’t know all that much about its technological side. It is, however, claimed to produce 617bhp in dual-motor form. Read more about the Skywell Skyhome Smart #5 We can’t get enough of rugged electric SUVs, and the #5 ticks all the right boxes. Far larger than the #1 and #3, it's similar in size to the Peugeot 5008. It packs 637bhp in dual-motor form, while the biggest battery can hold a whopping 100kWh of energy. Read more about the Smart #5 Suzuki eVitara The first electric Suzuki will go head-to-head with the recently launched Mini Aceman. We’re expecting a range of around 250 miles from the eVitara's larger (61kWh) battery, while charging speeds of up to 150kW have already been confirmed.  Read more about the Suzuki eVitara Tesla ‘Model 2’ This should finally be the year that Tesla’s long-anticipated entry-level model – believed to be a hatchback – will arrive, supposedly costing less than £25,000.  Read more about the Tesla Model 2 Tesla Model Y facelift The Model Y’s new look aims to keep it at the top of the pile as one of the world's best selling cars, with sleeker aerodynamics and improved material quality. Rear passengers now get a touchscreen, and there’s a slight performance boost for the all-wheel-drive model.  Read our Tesla Model Y review Toyota bZ3X This compact crossover will be built as part of Toyota’s joint venture with Chinese brand GAC. It will sit below the bZ4X and be sold alongside a fastback version, named the bZ3C. Range is pegged at 373 miles. Read more about the Toyota bZ3X Toyota bZ4X facelift Toyota's electric SUV is set to get a smaller battery and a new face. The new 57.7kWh battery will be available alongside the 73.1kWh pack and will be exclusively paired with a single, front-mounted, 165bhp motor. Range will increase from 318 to 356 miles. Everything we know about the new Toyota bZ4x Vauxhall Frontera Vauxhall’s new compact crossover offers a practical interior and a headline-grabbing price. While the electric version's range is on the meagre side, at 188 miles, its boot is a Nissan Qashqai-esque 460 litres.  Read our Vauxhall Frontera review Volvo ES90 Volvo’s first electric saloon will act as the premium brand’s flagship, sharing much of its underpinnings with the tech-rich new EX90 SUV. It will undercut the SUV significantly, with prices starting from around £70,000. Its slippery shape should give it a range in excess of 400 miles. Read more about the Volvo ES90 Volvo EX30 Cross Country Volvo's smallest EV gets a rugged design overhaul including front and rear skidplates, while its ride height increases by 19mm. Beneath the metal, it gets softened suspension and all-wheel drive. It'll be everything a 'weekend explorer' will need, Volvo says.  Read more about the Volvo EX30 Cross Country",

Read more about the new Renualt 4 Skoda Elroq The second EV to join Skoda’s model range comes in the form of a well-rounded SUV with a £31,500 price tag. It should prove to be decent value for money, with 360 miles of range, charging speeds of 145kW and a well-rounded drive.  Read our Skoda Elroq review Skoda Enyaq facelift A sleek styling update means the Enyaq should remain competitive in the world of long-range electric SUVs.

Power is punchy, at 201bhp, with a claimed 0-62mph sprint time of 3.9sec.  Read more about the Skywell Q hatchback Skywell Skyhome This Chinese limousine will look to upset the Mercedes-Benz EQS with sumptuous luxury. Aside from a roof-mounted TV, we don’t know all that much about its technological side. It is, however, claimed to produce 617bhp in dual-motor form. Read more about the Skywell Skyhome Smart #5 We can’t get enough of rugged electric SUVs, and the #5 ticks all the right boxes. Far larger than the #1 and #3, it's similar in size to the Peugeot 5008. It packs 637bhp in dual-motor form, while the biggest battery can hold a whopping 100kWh of energy.

Rear passengers now get a touchscreen, and there’s a slight performance boost for the all-wheel-drive model.  Read our Tesla Model Y review Toyota bZ3X This compact crossover will be built as part of Toyota’s joint venture with Chinese brand GAC.

Everything we know about the new Toyota bZ4x Vauxhall Frontera Vauxhall’s new compact crossover offers a practical interior and a headline-grabbing price.

It will undercut the SUV significantly, with prices starting from around £70,000. Its slippery shape should give it a range in excess of 400 miles.
