  "text": "Published:  October 24th, 2024 Today we bring you a 2003 Lexus IS 300 with a five-speed manual. Here's where I disclose some personal bias -- I love these things. The gauges were well-styled, these cars could handle, and the manual made them so much fun. Never mind that the metal shift knob could scald skin in summer or freeze it in the winter. Never mind that low-profile tires and RWD made them useless in snow. I wanted one then, and I want one now. This particular one is pretty stock and its flaws concern interior tears, a keyed exterior, and title/paperwork issues caused by said keying.\"You don't mess with another's automobile\", I say to paraphrase Vincent Vega. There are some other issues related to age, too, and the car has about 150K miles on it. It's in the LA are and you can see more here. The asking price is $9,000.[Images: Seller] Tim Healey Tim Healey grew up around the auto-parts business and has always had a love for cars — his parents joke his first word was “‘Vette”. Despite this, he wanted to pursue a career in sports writing but he ended up falling semi-accidentally into the automotive-journalism industry, first at Consumer Guide Automotive and later at Web2Carz.com. He also worked as an industry analyst at Mintel Group and freelanced for About.com, CarFax, Vehix.com, High Gear Media, Torque News, FutureCar.com, Cars.com, among others, and of course Vertical Scope sites such as AutoGuide.com, Off-Road.com, and HybridCars.com. He’s an urbanite and as such, doesn’t need a daily driver, but if he had one, it would be compact, sporty, and have a manual transmission. More by Tim Healey Published October 24th, 2024 5:30 PM Comments Join the conversation I really like this car , it’s refreshing not to have a 12 inch screen to figure out all the functions . Actual buttons . If I bought this car I would fix the locks asap. Also the dashboard not lighting up would drive me nuts . Seller: \"Car Fax: Will say car has been totaled, but that is because it was keyed all the way around and reported as such.\" So the key is, what is the state of the title? If it was involved in a claim it may have been legally totaled and gone to salvage title with him buying it back from the insurer. If this is going to be R-title at the end of the day and this seller wants the moon and the stars... find a better one with clean title and just pay more (unless you know of some grey area scheme to wash the title). Unless a clean title example with 150K on the clock is $25K or some such and this really is a quasi-deal, this guy can stick it with his greed. Additional: Kali is a very different world but 5-6 would be generous here, esp since most buyers nationally will have to drive or ship it 100s to 1000s of miles.",

If it was involved in a claim it may have been legally totaled and gone to salvage title with him buying it back from the insurer. If this is going to be R-title at the end of the day and this seller wants the moon and the stars... find a better one with clean title and just pay more (unless you know of some grey area scheme to wash the title). Unless a clean title example with 150K on the clock is $25K or some such and this really is a quasi-deal, this guy can stick it with his greed.\u003c/span\u003e\n    \n            \n    \n    \n            \n        \u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e                \u003cul\u003e\n                \u003cli id=\"cid-10494196\" data-c_writer_id=\"73319\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv data-comment-id=\"10494196\" data-comment-type=\"reply\" data-comment-writer=\"73319\" data-comment-writer-name=\"28-Cars-Later\" data-has-replies=\"\"\u003e\n            \n        \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n            \n            \u003cspan\u003eAdditional: Kali is a very different world but 5-6 would be generous here, esp since most buyers nationally will have to drive or ship it 100s to 1000s of miles.\u003c/span\u003e\n    \n            \n    \n    \n            \n        \u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e                \u003c/li\u003e                \u003c/ul\u003e\n\n        \u003c/li\u003e            \n                        \u003cli id=\"wrapper-comments-ad-2\"\u003e\n                            \n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n            \n            \u003c/ul\u003e\n                \n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n                    \n                    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
