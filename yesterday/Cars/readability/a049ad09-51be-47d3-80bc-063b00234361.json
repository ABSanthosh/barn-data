Finished in Nero Pegaso over Nero Perseus leather, the car is powered by a 6.2-liter V12 mated to a six-speed manual transmission and has been fitted with sport catalytic converters and a titanium exhaust system from Boden Auto Haus. The body incorporates scissor doors, automatically deploying rear intakes, and a speed-activated rear spoiler.

Further equipment includes an all-wheel-drive system with a limited-slip rear differential as well as a front-axle lift system, active dampers, and 18″ Speedline multi-piece wheels. This Murciélago has 9k miles and is now offered with a window sticker, accessories, the removed factory exhaust parts, a spare set of 18″ Hemera alloy wheels, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. Publicly unveiled at the 2001 Frankfurt Motor Show, the Murciélago was designed by Luc Donckerwolke as the replacement for the Diablo. The design features carbon-fiber body panels and aluminum scissor-type doors as well as a speed-activated rear spoiler and automatically deploying rear intakes. This example left the factory finished in Nero Pegaso and is said to wear paint protection film over the painted exterior bodywork. A pantograph windshield wiper, a louvered engine cover, and xenon headlights are further details. The taillights were replaced in 2022. Staggered-width 18″ Speedline multi-piece alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires measuring 245/35 up front and 335/30 out back. The car is equipped with active dampers and a front-axle lift system, while stopping power is provided by black-finished calipers fitted over cross-drilled rotors at each corner. The power-steering rack was rebuilt in 2022, and service in 2023 involved flushing the brake fluid as well as replacing the brake cooling ducts. The manually adjustable seats are trimmed in Nero Perseus leather with red accent stitching that extends to the dash, center console, and door panels. The seats are accompanied by inboard shoulder restraints, and a fire extinguisher is stored in the passenger-side footwell. Further equipment includes automatic climate control, a CD stereo, and Lamborghini-branded floor mats. The door shocks and trunk lining were replaced in 2022, while the air conditioning refrigerant was recharged in 2023. The leather-wrapped steering wheel is paired with a gated shifter. The wheel frames a 220-mph speedometer and a 9k-rpm tachometer as well as auxiliary gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and oil temperature. The digital odometer indicates 9k miles, approximately 5k of which have been added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 6.2-liter V12 was factory rated at 572 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque. The car has been modified with the installation of sport catalytic converters and a titanium exhaust from Boden Auto Haus of Costa Mesa, California. Service in 2023 involved replacing the crankshaft pulley and serpentine belt as well as changing the engine oil. The car most recently passed a California emissions test in January 2024, however, the installed exhaust components are not CARB-compliant. The removed factory exhaust parts are included in the sale. Power is routed to all four wheels via a six-speed manual transmission and an all-wheel-drive system with a limited-slip rear differential. A laminated copy of the window sticker shows initial delivery to Symbolic Motor Company and lists factory colors and equipment along with a total price of $281,100. A collection of accessories including a tool kit and seat covers will accompany the car along with the removed factory exhaust parts and a set of staggered-width 18″ Hercules aluminum-alloy wheels.
