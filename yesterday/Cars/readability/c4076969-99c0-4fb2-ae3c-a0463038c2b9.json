  "description": "The year is off to a good start, with several bike and scooter launches planned for this month. We've got a list of 11 models lined up from several manufacturers for January 2025. Ather 450X, 450S Ather has updated the 450X and 450S for 2025 and will be launching these on January 4. Both are expected to feature new software updatse, traction control, Magic Twist and a new set of colours as part of the update. While other aspects such as the battery, motor and chassis will likely remain unchanged. We can expect prices to go up by Rs 3,000 - Rs 6,000 for the 450s upon launch. Also see: Updated Ather 450X, 450S to be launched on January 4 Bajaj Pulsar RS200 Bajaj recently teased the return of the Pulsar RS200 on its social media. The Pulsar RS200 will likely receive minor updates to its styling, feature new colours and perhaps get a minor bump in features. It is also likely to receive an updated speedo like the one seen on the Pulsar N150, N160 and NS200. Bajaj could launch this update sometime this month, though It remains to be seen if Bajaj will make any mechanical changes to the Pulsar RS200. Also see: Bajaj Pulsar RS200 update teased ahead of launch Royal Enfield Scram 440 Last year at Motoverse, Royal Enfield unveiled the updated Scram 440 which is scheduled to launch sometime this month. The engine has now been upgraded from 411cc to 443cc which has been achieved by a bore increase of 3mm. The Scram 440 produces 25.4hp at 6,250rpm and 34Nm at 4,000rpm which is an increase of 1hp and 2Nm. Additionally it now gets a 6-speed gearbox and remains mechanically unchanged otherwise. Also see: Royal Enfield Scram 440 revealed, launch in January 2025 Royal Enfield Classic 650 Royal Enfield has already showcased the Classic 650 and we even rode it towards the end of last year in the UK. The Classic 650 shares its underpinnings with the Shotgun 650, with the only key difference being in styling, wheels and front suspension. The Classic 650 will be available in four colours - Vallam Red, Bruntingthorpe Blue, Teal and Black Chrome. We have been led to believe that the starting price for the big Classic will be in the Shotgun’s ballpark (Rs 3.59 lakh - Rs 3.73 lakh) and the top variant could cost around the same as the flagship Royal Enfield - the Super Meteor 650, which is priced between Rs 3.64 lakh and Rs 3.94 lakh.

Hero Xtreme 250R, Karizma XMR 250 and Xpulse 210   Hero revealed all three models at EICMA 2024 and has now sent us an invite for January 19, with the words “Thrill awaits”. This leads us to believe it is likely going to be either of the 250s or could even be the all new Xpulse 210. Both the Karizma and Xtreme will be powered by a 250cc motor that produces 30hp and 25Nm. The Xpulse 210 on the other hand uses the Karizma XMR 210’s engine that produces 24.6hp at 9,250rpm and 20.7Nm at 7,250rpm in the Xpulse 210. The upcoming Xpulse 210 also weighs 11 kilos more than the outgoing Xpulse 200 4V. We can expect all three motorcycles to cost around the Rs 2 lakh - Rs 2.3 lakh mark upon launch.

Honda has since revealed both models in India and bookings for both of them have already begun. The Activa e: is powered by a pair of 1.5kWh removable battery packs with a claimed IDC range of 102km. The QC1, on the other hand, is powered by a 1.5kWh battery pack and has a claimed IDC range of 80km. It is worth noting that customers will be able to swap batteries for the Activa e at Honda dealerships across the country.

While only the 390 Adventure S and 390 Enduro R were on display, KTM says it will be bringing the base 390 Adventure X alongside these models to India. While official specifications haven’t been released, we know it will be powered by the same motor that’s currently found in the outgoing 390 Duke. The 390 Adventure S will also get a 21-inch wheel at the front and a 19-inch wheel at the rear. The 390 Enduro R will get a 21-inch wheel at the front and an 18-inch wheel at the rear. The 390 Adventure S will also be the first motorcycle in its segment to feature cruise control. Also see: KTM 390 Adventure S, 390 Enduro R unofficial bookings open in India",
