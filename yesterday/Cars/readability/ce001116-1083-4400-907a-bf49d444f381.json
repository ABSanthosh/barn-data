  "text": "The good news is you might not have to wait 17 years for the next generation of the Supra sports coupe May 30, 2025 at 20:18 by Michael Gauthier 2026 marks the final model year for the 382 hp Toyota GR Supra after a six-year run. Officials have suggested the model will return, but when and how are still up in the air. There could be a “significantly” shorter gap between the fifth- and sixth-generation cars. The past few years haven’t been kind to sports cars lately, with some of the most recognizable names either bowing out or undergoing dramatic transformations. The Chevrolet Camaro is gone. The Dodge Charger is now electric. And if that wasn’t enough, both the Nissan GT-R and Toyota Supra appear to be heading toward the same uncertain horizon. However, it seems nothing is truly dead these days and Toyota officials are already looking forward to the next Supra. While specifics are few and far between, Toyota Motor North America’s Senior Vice President of Product Planning and Strategy, Cooper Ericksen, recently talked about the car’s future. More: 2026 GR Supra Final Edition Goes Loud On Looks But Quiet Where It Counts Speaking to MotorTrend, Ericksen said, “It would be logical that we would have a next-gen Supra. But when and how is still TBD [to be determined].” He went on to say there will be a break between the fifth- and sixth-generation cars, but “our goal [is] to have a gap that is significantly less” than between the fourth- and fifth-gen coupes. Of course, that’s an incredibly low bar as there was a 17-year gap between the last two Supras. That’s an eternity in the automotive world and would have been enough time for another two generations. How long remains the million dollar question, but Ericksen suggested it could be a ways off as “we have our hands full just to keep selling our core products.” That’s especially true nowadays as there are multiple new factors at play including tariffs, politics, and electrification. Ericksen then went on to hint at the reason for the Supra’s demise as he said, “It’s just not cost effective with all the new regulations and investment we have to make.” Sales could have also played a role as the company only sold 2,615 units in the United States last year.",
