  "text": "If you have a low-mileage Honda sitting in your garage, now might be the perfect time to sell it February 1, 2025 at 19:18 by Brad Anderson A 1991 Honda CRX Si with only 326 miles recently sold for a shocking $71,500. A low-mileage 2000 Honda Civic Si Coupe fetched $66,000 at Mecum’s auction. Both models were in pristine, factory-original condition with minimal signs of use. Over the past few years, we’ve watched prices of Honda S2000, NSX, and several Type R models surge, but never did we think we’d live to see the day when a 1991 CRX Si would sell for $71,500 and a 2000 Civic Si Coupe would fetch $66,000. However, at Mecum’s Kissimmee auction in mid-January, that’s exactly what happened. As you might expect, these aren’t just any old Hondas. The 1991 CRX Si, for instance, has only 326 miles (525 km) on the odometer, an almost inconceivably low figure for a car that was built to be driven hard, modified endlessly, and, in most cases, eventually crashed by an overenthusiastic owner. Instead, this one has somehow survived untouched, still looking as fresh as it did rolling off the production line more than three decades ago. Read: This 1990 Honda CRX Si With Only 12k Miles Sold For $40,000 The exterior is finished in a tasty shade of Teal, a color Honda should seriously consider reviving. The CRX looks to be in completely original condition, still riding on the OEM wheels and without any visible scuffs on the paint. No details about the car’s ownership and service history have been listed, but that clearly didn’t dissuade interested bidders, who were too busy engaging in a financial arms race over a car they’ll probably never drive. Inside, the story is much the same. The seats, carpets, and steering wheel look factory fresh, as if Honda just pulled it out of a long-lost showroom. We can completely understand the appeal of wanting to own a low-mileage CRX like this, although paying $71,500 for it is quite extraordinary. At what point does nostalgia cross over into financial insanity? 1991 Honda CRX Si Mecum Auctions Then there’s this fabulous 2000 Honda Civic Si Coupe that sold for $66,000. It’s been driven just 2,061 miles (3,316 km). Painted in Electron Blue Pearl, this Civic Si shares the same five-speed manual transmission and front-wheel-drive setup as the CRX, with power coming from a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine. It’s a fun, rev-happy car, but is it $66,000 worth of fun? There’s plenty going for the Civic inside, too. Sure, the gauge cluster and stereo stack are dated by modern standards, but all parts and surfaces appear to have held up well over the past 25 years. Stick-shift Civics of this era are a joy to drive, and while it’s a shame this one has been driven so little, we’re hopeful the new owner will take it out and won’t just lock it away in a garage. Would you spend this kind of money on a CRX or Civic Si, or would you rather have something with a more power for the price? Drop your thoughts in the comments—we’re curious where you stand. 2000 Honda Civic Si Coupe Mecum Auctions",
