  "text": "The incentives are meant to help Tesla hit its Q4 target of shifting at least 515,000 vehicles in North America November 15, 2024 at 19:51 by Stephen Rivers Tesla just added new incentives to buyers who take delivery before 2025.  Customers who take advantage get free supercharging and full self-driving for three months.  The move comes as Tesla works to avoid a down year regarding overall deliveries.  Tesla is under pressure to sell just over 500,000 vehicles in North America during the fourth quarter. To hit that target, the company is now offering a new incentive: three months of free Supercharging and Full Self-Driving (FSD). If Tesla falls short, it will break a long-running streak of meeting its lofty sales goals. Shifting that many cars in a quarter isn’t easy, so Tesla is sweetening the deal. Buyers who take delivery before 2025 will get three free months of supercharging. That could make holiday road trips a little more appealing since drivers could essentially drive nationwide for free.  More: Trump Reportedly Wants To Kill $7,500 EV Tax Credit, And Tesla Might Be Cool With It In addition, the same buyers will get three free months of Full Self-Driving (Supervised). Shoppers who add FSD to their purchase of the car “will not get an alternative option.” Notably, the free FSD incentive cannot be deferred to a later date, even if the buyer completes their purchase and takes delivery before 2025. It’s also worth noting that Tesla is already offering additional perks, including discounts on several models, the ability to transfer FSD from an existing vehicle to a new one, and 0% APR financing options. Clearly, it’s pulling out all the stops that it can to reach its sales goal of 515,000 cars delivered in Q4. That’s where the streak comes into play. Tesla has increased deliveries every year for a decade. If it doesn’t sell 515,000 vehicles over the fourth quarter, it’ll miss that mark.  All of this comes at a time when EV buyers might already have their own personal incentive to buy in. President-elect Donald Trump could reportedly ax the federal EV tax credit once he assumes his post in January. If he does, it might hurt Tesla, at least in the short term, but could absolutely crush other EV automakers. Thus, if you’re considering a Tesla, it might be time to get one while the discounts (and tax credits) are still available.",
