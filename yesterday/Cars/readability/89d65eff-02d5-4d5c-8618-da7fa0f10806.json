The car is powered by a 289ci V8 paired with a three-speed automatic transmission and is refinished in red over black vinyl. Work under current ownership has included the installation of FiTech electronic fuel injection, a Borgeson power steering kit, a Bluetooth-capable RetroSound stereo, a replacement power brake booster and master cylinder, and replacement front bucket seats and carpeting. The car is further equipped with a limited-slip differential, a black convertible soft top, and 14″ steel wheels. This Mustang is now offered with a window sticker, an initial purchase contract, the owner’s manual, service records, a car cover, spare parts, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The car was factory-finished in Poppy Red and was refinished under previous ownership. It has a black convertible soft top and chrome bumpers. The 14″ steel wheels wear covers and are mounted with 195/75 Hankook tires. The suspension was overhauled in 2001, a replacement power brake booster and master cylinder was installed in 2018, and a Borgeson power steering kit was installed in 2019. The front bucket seats were replaced in 2018 along with the seat belts and carpeting. A Bluetooth-capable RetroSound stereo was also installed. Amenities include a cabin heater and a center console with storage and cup holders. Instrumentation consists of a 120-mph speedometer flanked by fuel-level and water-temperature gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 91k miles, approximately 75 of which were added under current ownership. The C-code 289ci V8 was factory rated at 200 horsepower, and a FiTech electronic fuel injection system was installed in 2018. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission that was fitted in place of the factory three-speed manual under previous ownership. The warranty number is consistent with a 1965 Mustang convertible that was built in San Jose, California and equipped with a 289ci V8 with a two-barrel carburetor. Decoding the trim tag reveals the following information: Body 76A – Convertible with standard interior Color 3 – Poppy Red paint Trim 26 – Black crinkle vinyl Date 11V – August 11, 1965 build date DSO 72 – San Jose district sales office Axle F – 2.80:1 limited-slip rear axle ratio Trans 1 – Three-speed manual transmission The window sticker shows initial delivery to Paul Swanson Ford of Los Gatos, California, factory options, and a total price of $3,042.08.
