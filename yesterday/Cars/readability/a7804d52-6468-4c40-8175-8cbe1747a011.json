The car is powered by a 250ci inline-six paired with a four-speed manual transmission and is finished in metallic brown with a black landau vinyl roof over brown leather upholstery. Equipment includes power steering, power front disc brakes, a Weber IDF carburetor, front bucket seats, a pistol-grip shifter, and Noova 17″ alloy wheels. The car was acquired by the seller in mid-2024, and service in the time since has included cleaning and sealing the fuel tank, replacing the spark plugs, flushing the radiator, and changing the oil. This Opala Series 2 coupe is now offered with spare parts and a clean Texas title in the seller’s name. The Opala was based on Opel’s German-market Rekord Series C and Commodore Series A models but featured local styling, and it also came in sedan and wagon configurations. This example was refinished in metallic brown with white beltline stripes under previous ownership. Exterior features include a black landau-style vinyl roof, Cibie fog lamps, dual side mirrors, quad taillights, bright wheel-lip trim and rocker-panel moldings, and chrome bumpers with rubber-faced guards. The side windows were re-installed by the seller, who notes that the driver’s window requires assistance to raise. Close-up photos that show paint bubbles above the driver-side door handle and on top of the left quarter panel as well as rust along the bottom edge of the passenger-side door and on the right-front underbody can be viewed in the gallery below. Noova 17″ alloy wheels that feature a brushed finish are mounted with 215/45 Maxxis Victra Z4S tires. The shocks were replaced under current ownership. The steering is power assisted, as are the front disc and rear drum brakes. The seller states that the front brake rotors are worn to their minimum thickness. The cabin features front high-back bucket and rear bench seats upholstered in brown leather with a color-coordinated dash pad, door panels, and carpeting. Appointments include a push-button Motoradio FM-luxe AM/FM radio, a woodgrain pistol-grip shifter, a center console, tilt steering, lap belts, a rear-seat fold-down center armrest, and carpeted floor mats. The shifter boot’s chrome trim ring and the driver-side dash vent are missing, and custom trunk carpeting is included in the sale but is not attached. The three-spoke woodgrain steering wheel fronts a 180-km/h speedometer, a two-in-one combination gauge, and a clock, while the woodgrain-trimmed center stack houses a Cronomac tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline and a shift light as well as gauges for coolant temperature, voltage, and oil temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 58k kilometers (~36k miles), approximately 2k kilometers of which were added by the seller. The dash-mounted coolant-temperature light is inoperative due to its wiring having been re-routed to the center-stack gauge. The oil-temperature gauge is not connected. The 250ci inline-six was factory rated at 125 horsepower, and it breathes through a Weber IDF carburetor with screened velocity stacks as well as a set of exhaust headers flowing into a dual exhaust system. Service under current ownership included cleaning and sealing the fuel tank, flushing the radiator, adjusting the valves and the timing, replacing the spark plugs, and changing the oil. The seller states that the carburetor is in need of adjustment, and the plastic fuel-tank outlet has fissure cracks. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual gearbox and a Spicer rear axle. The car is accompanied by a collection of spare parts including gaskets, seals, cables, hoses, water and fuel pumps, an oil-temperature sending unit, carburetor and clutch kits, ball joints, rod ends, bushings, coil springs, and removed shocks.
