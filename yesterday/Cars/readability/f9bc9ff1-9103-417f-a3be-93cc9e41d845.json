  "text": "The tri-motor concept will be competing in the Mint 400 March 5, 2025 at 19:09 by Michael Gauthier Chevrolet has introduced the new Silverado EV ZR2 race truck concept. It features a lifted suspension, Multimatic dampers, and 37-inch mud-terrain tires. Power is provided by a tri-motor AWD system that produces a combined output of 1,100 hp. Rugged trucks have been a huge hit with consumers and Chevrolet’s ZR2 lineup is among the most popular. Now, the company is giving us a glimpse at what an electric version could look like. Unveiled at the Mint 400 off-road race, the Silverado EV ZR2 race truck concept was developed in just five months and is built almost entirely out of production parts. Since it will be taking part in the event, the pickup has been equipped with a lifted suspension and Multimatic continuously adaptive dampers. These changes help to deliver more than 13 inches (330 mm) of wheel travel.

They’re joined by locking differentials, underbody protection, and an assortment of auxiliary lights. Rounding out the highlights are rock rails, red recovery hooks, and a ZR2-branded sport bar. While the standard Silverado EV has a dual-motor all-wheel drive system producing up to 760 hp (567 kW / 771 PS) and 785 lb-ft (1,063 Nm) of torque, the concept is far more powerful. In fact, it features a tri-motor powertrain with a combined output of 1,100 hp (820 kW / 1,115 PS) and 11,500 lb-ft (15,574 Nm) of torque. Of course, it’s safe to assume the latter figure is more of an exercise in math than anything else. According to Chevrolet Vice President Scott Bell, “There is no better proving ground to test the limits of our vehicles than competitive racing. The Silverado EV ZR2 race truck concept, which uses 98% GM production parts, showcases some of the best of Chevrolet to produce a beyond-capable pickup to tackle a challenging race of the Mint 400’s magnitude.” While the ZR2 is simply a concept at this point, Chevrolet revealed the 2026 Silverado EV Trail Boss will arrive this summer. We’ll learn more in the coming weeks, but the truck features a factory-installed lift as well as 18-inch wheels wrapped in 35-inch all-terrain tires.",
