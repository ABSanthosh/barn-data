The water pump was rebuilt and a replacement left cylinder head, piston rings, radiators, alternator, and the oil cooler as well as various gaskets, seals, and bearings were installed. The car is powered by a 4.9-liter flat-12 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Rosso Corsa over Beige Connolly leather. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels, pop-up headlights, air conditioning, power windows, a Kenwood head unit, and a gated shifter. This Testarossa shows 38k miles as well as registration history in California and Texas, and it is now offered by the selling dealer with service records, a tool kit, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Texas title. The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Rosso Corsa and features pop-up headlights, fog lights, an asymmetrical cooling duct beneath the left fog lamp, side intake strakes, black-finished rocker panels, and quad exhaust outlets. Paint blemishes including rock chips and scrapes on the underside of the front bumper cover are shown in detail in the gallery. Silver 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Toyo Proxes Sport tires. Braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated discs. The Schrader valves were replaced and a brake fluid flush was performed in August 2022. Beige Connolly leather covers the seats and door panels, and the dashboard was re-covered in brown leather in August 2022. Interior amenities include a Kenwood head unit, motorized seat belts, and a gated shifter located on the center console alongside controls for the air conditioning and power windows. The power windows were repaired and window channel rubber was replaced in July 2024. There are signs of wear on both seats, wear marks around the shifter, and seals for the driver’s door and front trunk have separated. Detailed photos of the interior are provided in the gallery. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames Veglia instrumentation including a 200-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,800-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil pressure and coolant temperature. A clock and auxiliary gauges for fuel level and oil temperature are housed in the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 38k miles. The 4.9-liter flat-12 was removed from the car in August 2022 for service, which included a valve job as well as replacing the left cylinder head, piston rings, crank seals, the timing and accessory belts, radiators, coolant hoses, the oil cooler, spark plugs, injector seals, and the alternator. Additional work included rebuilding the water pump as well as replacing the valve cover, intake and end cover gaskets and the rod, main, tensioner, and thrust bearings. The heater core was repaired and the AC compressor, drier, an expansion valve, and the engine oil were replaced in July 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The clutch was adjusted in July 2024. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage and lists an initial entry in November 1990. The Texas title carries a “VIN Certification Waived” notation in the remarks section.
