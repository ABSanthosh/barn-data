  "text": "Despite receiving thousands of violations, these super-scofflaws avoid points on their licenses April 19, 2025 at 21:08 by Stephen Rivers New York has several ‘super-scofflaws’ who owe the state over $200,000 in unpaid tickets. An Audi A6 driver in NYC accumulated 563 tickets in 2024, totaling $58,149.57 in fines. Most of these violations are recorded by cameras, so drivers avoid points on their licenses. Speed cameras, red light cameras, and even noise cameras. If you’ve been in New York City, you’ve seen them. They’re practically as ubiquitous as overpriced coffee shops at this point. Last year, these cameras handed out thousands of tickets, and get this: more than 500 went to a single driver who has racked up over $50,000 in fines over the past few years. And no, that’s not an isolated case. It turns out many drivers seem to think the rules of the road don’t apply to them, and the city’s cameras don’t seem to be doing much to stop it. More: Florida Highway Patrol Has America’s Coolest Cop Car NYC’s StreetsBlog reviewed publicly available data, including information from How’s My Driving NY, to assess how well the city’s camera systems are working and to gauge how dangerous the streets truly are. It turns out, the measure of danger is often how many people are breaking the law. By that metric, the aforementioned Audi A6 driver is the worst offender, hands down. New York’s Worst Driver In 2024 alone, this driver accumulated a staggering 563 tickets. The majority of those were for speeding, with a particularly troubling 626 violations in school zones between December 2023 and November 2024. And let’s not forget about the handful of tickets for driving in a bus lane or running red lights. As Jalopnik pointed out, this same Audi A6 driver also managed to rack up 7 speeding fines in a single day, totaling $350 in violations. On average, that’s 1.54 tickets per day, with each fine clocking in at a minimum of $50. In total, the Audi A6 driver has accumulated $58,149.57 in fines, of which $46,636.60 has already been paid. And it’s not just this person either. Another driver in a Mercedes-Benz picked up 474 tickets last year and currently owes the state $47,858.17 in unpaid tickets. According to the report, the majority of these super-scofflaws simply ignore the fines rather than pay them because, since they’re not handed out by an NYPD officer, they don’t carry points. That means these drivers can just keep on driving until the state steps in to do something more serious. “These results point to a small population with a shocking pattern of recidivism, resistance to traditional deterrents, and disregard for human life,” said Transportation Authority Executive Director Ben Furnas. The real question then is what will NYC do to deter this kind of driving? “Luckily, we have a solution that will keep New Yorkers safe, [a bill] that would require speed limiters in the vehicles of the worst-of-the-worst repeat offenders. It’s time for Albany to pass this legislation now before the next deadly crash,” said Furnas. That bill is SB S7621 and it’s still several steps away from becoming law. In the meantime, it seems like New York’s super-speeders can keep on disregarding the rules, and the safety of everyone else on the road.",
