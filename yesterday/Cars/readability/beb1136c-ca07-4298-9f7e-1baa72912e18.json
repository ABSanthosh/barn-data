The Lexus RZ is the firm’s flagship electric car, and instead it ought to offer “confidence, control and comfort”.Mind you, it still has up to 309bhp and will out-accelerate quite a few hot hatches.The RZ was Lexus' first step into getting serious about EVs. It had the UX 300e for a while, but that was never quite a heavy hitter, whereas this car is and goes toe to toe with the likes of the Tesla Model Y, Nissan Ariya and Hyundai Ioniq 5.The RZ shares its e-TNGA platform – which is bespoke to EVs – with the Toyota bZ4X and Subaru Solterra.A cheaper, front-wheel-drive model (badged 300e) joined the range in 2024 to address issues concerning range and price. Verdict Lexus addresses the key flaw – and more – of its luxurious electric SUV GoodMaterial quality in interior is superbVery practical, especially in rear seatsWelcome range improvementsBadSteer-by-wire doesn't feel necessaryNo frunkA lot of money still DESIGN \u0026 STYLING Pros Clean, modern standout designNew, larger battery should improve range Cons Large and not so easy to parkIsn't as spacious as other rivals The new RZ looks almost exactly the same as the previous car, with the majority of the changes coming beneath the metal. Battery upgrades, improvements to body rigidity and handling and enhanced comfort are among the wide-reaching changes. They apply across a three-model range that comprises the single-motor, front-wheel-drive RZ 350e (our main focus here, as Lexus anticipates it will take a 65% share of RZ sales in the UK, mostly in middling Premium Plus trim), the dual-motor, four-wheel-drive 500e and the more overtly performance-oriented 550e.The most significant change is the introduction of a slightly larger (77kWh) battery, with a new cooling system and pre-conditioning for rapid charging.It addresses the original RZ’s biggest \u001dflaw, a comparatively short range, upping the total from 297 to 353 miles in the 350e (and to 311 miles in the 500e).Lexus has also added a more powerful (22kW) on-board AC charger and worked to improve DC charging performance in lower temperatures, although the maximum rate remains 150kW.Further changes beneath the metal concern the RZ’s suspension, with adjustments made to the front bushings and the front and rear dampers. Lexus also claims body rigidity has been improved with additional bracing, to the benefit of handling. At 4805mm in length, it’s a fair bit longer than the bZ4X, Ioniq 5 and Skoda Enyaq.The flagship of the RZ line-up and the first Lexus EV to receive an F Sport makeover, the new RZ 550e is also the inaugural model in the Japanese \u001dfirm’s line-up to receive a sophisticated steer-by-wire system and a simulated manual drive shift.In addition, the 550e F Sport gets sportier bodywork, including 20in wheels, bumper air ducts, a rear diffuser and a rear spoiler. INTERIOR Pros Material quality is up there with best in class Cons Big infotainment screen can be distracting The RZ’s trump card is its classy interior, which is cosseting and comfortable in typical Lexus fashion.Material quality is high, from the plush seats to the soft-touch Ultrasuede upholstery and synthetic leather.Lexus has made an effort to improve soundproofing and insulation through better floor adhesives, noise-reducing felt and a new motor mount design that better suppresses vibration. All this makes the RZ quieter and more re\u001dfined than before over most road surfaces, more so than the Volvo EX40.Higher trims bring the soft leather and interesting technical materials to rival the Genesis GV60 but lower ones introduce some coarser leather and cheaper plastics.The 14.0in infotainment touchscreen is as easy to use as a phone, but it can be distracting because it hosts the fan-speed controls.Leg room in the back is huge, making the RZ one of the most practical electric SUVs on the market. The boot too is right up there with rivals and features underfloor storage for the charging cables. There's no under-bonnet storage, mind you. And no glovebox if you get the infrared heater.Lexus has equipped upper versions of the RZ with small infrared heaters to try to save some all-important battery.Traditional heating isn't energy-efficient and the sister bZ4X is known to chew through battery trying to heat and cool the car. These heaters act a bit like a blanket for your legs and knees. They work well and interact seamlessly with the heated seat and steering wheel. ENGINES \u0026 PERFORMANCE Cons Most buyers would prefer less power and more range The 350e’s single motor produces 221bhp and 198lb ft of torque, which propels the two-tonne SUV from 0-62mph in a reasonably brisk 7.5sec.The dual-motor 500e gets a performance boost over the old 450e too: its combined total of 376bhp lets it hit 62mph in 4.4sec.Power delivery is smooth but unexciting, which is likely to suit Lexus’s typical customer base better than the more aggressive Tesla Model Y, which will sprint to 62mph almost two seconds quicker.Like with any decent-powered EV, there’s real neck-snap acceleration under full throttle in its sportiest setting. But it’s very unlikely that you will be doing this very often. Why? Keep scrolling to get our verdict on the range…The front-wheel-drive model cuts power to 201bhp, extending the 0-62mph time by about 2.5sec. But it’s not like it’s slow, and Lexus isn’t making huge dynamism claims for the RZ anyway.In the dual-motor 550e, power is up to 402bhp, and it'll hit 0-62mph in 4.4sec. In top-of-the-range F Sport cars, drivers get manual paddle shifters to work in tandem with the steer-by-wire system.As with the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, if adds a simulated manual gear shift, plus a simulated engine noise is projected into the cabin.The ‘gears’ add a sense of engagement and ‘shift’ quickly and will even knock down once it hits the top of the ‘rev limiter’.However, the gruff engine noise isn’t convincing, and ultimately it doesn’t seem a feature that will attract hardened driving enthusiasts in the way that it might on the Ioniq 5 N or even the Kia EV6 GT. RIDE \u0026 HANDLING Pros Smooth and quietClever four-wheel drive system improves drivability Cons Feels its weight in the corners if you’re pressing on Further changes beneath the metal concern the RZ’s suspension, with adjustments made to the front bushings and the front and rear dampers.Lexus also claims body rigidity has been improved with additional bracing, to the benefit of handling.The RZ still isn’t keen to be thrown into corners with much vigour, but it’s effortless to drive and will navigate most turns with ease, as a premium SUV should, and it’s more direct and simpler to guide than the Volvo EX40.In basic 300e form, the RZ rides softly and makes light work of potholes and other road corrugations. I found the 18in wheels soaked up the Algarve’s more fractured road surfaces far more agreeably than the 550e’s 20in rims.Despite not being offered with adaptive dampers, the RZ is a very smooth and quiet-riding car that’s reassuring, satisfying and surprisingly plush-feeling, although not exciting, to drive.On all-wheel drive models, you can genuinely feel the effects of what Lexus calls Direct4, a system whereby power and braking force are rapidly shuffled between the front and rear axles to control and reduce the pitch and dive that normally accompany acceleration and braking. It stops short of being transformative but does introduce a pleasant calmness to the way the car drives.Although the software can cleverly distribute torque, the front motor is more powerful than the rear one, so the RZ feels at best neutral when cornering under power.  That’s fine, though: it’s not trying to be sporty, remember. And even so, the RZ musters adequate grip, while its standard steering is well weighted.Naturally, the FWD model goes without the Direct4 system. But there’s a comfortable honesty about the 300e’s straightforward ride, handling and steering.Owing to its larger wheels, plus retuned spring rates and shock absorbers, the F Sport rides more rigidly than standard RZs. Speed bumps, potholes and road cracks are more noticeable as a result, but snug sports seats help ensure it’s never uncomfortable.Steer-by-wire reviewLexus’s One Motion Grip steerby-wire system, which removes any mechanical link between the steering wheel and the wheels by controlling inputs through electric signals, has been a long time coming (we drove a prototype back in 2022) but is now included as standard on the F Sport and plusher F Sport Takumi variants.Complete with a yoke in place of a wheel, the system feels surreal and unnatural at \u001dfirst, requiring just a 200deg turn from neutral to full lock in both directions.There is a learning curve here, but after some familiarisation, you begin to trust the system’s varying steer ratios and where to put your hands. Aided by those fancy new wheels and performance bodywork, the F Sport is a touch more accurate and progressive in corners than a standard RZ. It certainly adds a sense of occasion, although we did find the smaller indicator and wiper stalks were harder to reach. MPG \u0026 RUNNING COSTS Pros New battery means more rangeReal-world efficiency improvements Cons Charging speeds down on rivalsEVs costing much less go much further The battery capacity of the previous RZ was 71.4kWh, which was smaller than key rivals. In 2025, Lexus updated the RZ with a new, larger 77kWh battery to address the model's biggest flaw: range. Range increases from 297 to 353 miles in the 350e, while the 500e gets 311 miles. The 550e F Sport gets 280 miles of range. You should note, however, that the range is heavily dependent on specification. Cars on 18in wheels are put at 353 miles, while those with 20in wheels drop to 316 miles.Is it more efficient, though? Over a 60-mile driving route, our test car returned 3.7mpkWh, equal to 284 miles on a full charge – quite some way off\u001eLexus’s claim of 353 miles, although we did make liberal use of the air conditioning in sweltering weather.It’s not far off the Audi Q6 E-tron, which has a much bigger battery but achieved 2.9mpkWh in our hands, corresponding to around 290 miles. Effectively, it's pretty par for the course for a heavy, larger SUV of this size and weight. The car's rapid-charging rates are also unimpressive, 150kW being the bare minimum we would expect from a new premium EV. That's unchanged from the previous RZ. Pricing isn’t yet confirmed, but a slight increase over the current £50,000 starting point is expected. That’s not cheap, but you get ambient lighting, a panoramic roof, wireless phone charging and dual-zone climate control as standard.Our Premium Plus test car also had ventilated memory seats, a head-up display and control touchpads on the steering wheel. VERDICT Verdict Lexus addresses the key flaw – and more – of its luxurious electric SUV GoodMaterial quality in interior is superbVery practical, especially in rear seatsWelcome range improvementsBadSteer-by-wire doesn't feel necessaryNo frunkA lot of money still While the changes to the RZ aren’t revolutionary, they do combine to make this car a more compelling package than before. Addressing the model’s largest weakness – range – has brought it more in line with premium rivals such as the Audi Q4 E-tron and the Genesis GV60. Its practicality and interior quality are still the main reasons you would be drawn to it. The FWD 300e is our pick of the RZ range simply because it goes further on a charge. The RZ heralds in some interesting new technology and is all the better for it on the road.  The F Sport, meanwhile, is certainly unique in many respects, with intriguing technology and good performance. However, the steer-by-wire system doesn’t seem an obvious draw, and nor probably will the price: Lexus hasn’t confirmed anything yet, but don’t be surprised if it surpasses £70,000.

Over a 60-mile driving route, our test car returned 3.7mpkWh, equal to 284 miles on a full charge – quite some way off\u001eLexus’s claim of 353 miles, although we did make liberal use of the air conditioning in sweltering weather.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s not far off the Audi Q6 E-tron, which has a much bigger battery but achieved 2.9mpkWh in our hands, corresponding to around 290 miles. Effectively, it\u0026#39;s pretty par for the course for a heavy, larger SUV of this size and weight. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe car\u0026#39;s rapid-charging rates are also unimpressive, 150kW being the bare minimum we would expect from a new premium EV. That\u0026#39;s unchanged from the previous RZ. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePricing isn’t yet confirmed, but a slight increase over the current £50,000 starting point is expected.
