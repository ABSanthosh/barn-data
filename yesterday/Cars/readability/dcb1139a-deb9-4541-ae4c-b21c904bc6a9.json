  "description": "Pune-based Vayve Mobility has launched the new Eva electric urban car in India, with introductory prices starting at Rs 3.25 lakh. It is available with three battery pack options – 9kWh, 12.6kWh, and 18kWh – and bookings have commenced for Rs 5,000. The Vayve Eva is on display at the ongoing Auto Expo 2025, and the company says deliveries will begin in the second half of 2026, as it is still under development. The Vayve Eva comes with an optional solar roof panel It comes with three battery sizes: 9kWh, 12.6kWh and 18kWh It's available with battery subscription services The company is also offering additional benefits to the first 25,000 customers who book the vehicle, including an extended battery warranty and 3 years of complimentary vehicle connectivity. Here’s a detailed look at the prices of the Vayve Eva: Vavye Eva prices (ex-showroom)Variant Price Price with battery subscription Nova (9kWh)Rs 3.99 lakh Rs 3.25 lakh Stella (12.6kWh)Rs 4.99 lakh Rs 3.99 lakh Vega (18kWh)Rs 5.99 lakh Rs 4.49 lakh The optional solar roof can be had for Rs 20,000 on the Nova and Stella variants and Rs 25,000 on the top-spec Vega variant. If opted with battery-as-a-service, Vayve charges Rs 2/km, with a minimum running distance of 600 km, 800 km, and 1200 km for the Nova, Stella, and Vega variants, respectively. Vayve Eva: what is it? Sitting on a 2,200mm wheelbase, the Eva is 3,060mm long, 1,150mm wide and 1,590mm high. For reference, the wheelbase and length are slightly more than those of the MG Comet. The slim, two-door, quadricycle-like design is specifically designed to navigate the tight confines of our urban spaces, and it rides on small 12-inch wheels. It is a three-seater vehicle with a centrally positioned driver’s seat at the front and a bench seat for two passengers at the rear. Vayve has also equipped Eva’s cabin with a dual-screen setup, comprising a touchscreen and a digital instrument cluster, along with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone connectivity, a six-way adjustable driver’s seat, climate control, a reverse parking camera, hill-hold assist, vehicle diagnostics, and over-the-air updates. A total of six exterior colours are on offer: Moonstone White, Light Platinum, Rose Coral, Sky Blue, Champagne Gold and Cherry Red. Vavye Eva range and specifications The Eva promises a 250km range on a single charge from the 18kWh battery. Meanwhile, the 9kWh and 12kWh batteries return 125km and 175km, respectively. If opted with the optional solar roof panel, it can add up to 10km to the driving range. Vayve claims that an annual mileage of 3,000km can be achieved using solar energy from the panel. Also, its running cost is just Rs 0.5 per kilometre, which Vavye says is one-tenth of the cost of a normal petrol hatchback. Powered by a 40Nm RWD motor, the Eva EV sprints from 0-40kph in 5 seconds, with a top speed of 70kph. The battery unit, placed under the floor, has a waterproof rating of IP67; other safety bits include a driver airbag and seatbelts for all passengers. Vavye says the battery can be topped up from 10 to 70 percent in 15 minutes using a DC charger and can take up to 5 hours using a normal 15A household socket.  Also See: Hyundai Ioniq 9 SUV showcased at Auto Expo 2025 BYD Sealion 7 bookings open: Auto Expo 2025",
