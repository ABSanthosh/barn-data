One of approximately 800 fiberglass-bodied vetroresina examples produced between 1975 and 1977, the car is finished in Azzurro Metallizzato over beige leather upholstery. Power is provided by a 2.9-liter quad-cam V8 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle, and equipment includes a limited-slip differential, 14″ five-spoke alloy wheels, pop-up headlights, air conditioning, a gated shifter, and electric windows. It was acquired by the selling dealer in 2022, and work performed since is said to have included refinishing the paint and replacing the timing belts and thermostat. This 308 GTB vetroresina is offered with a Ferrari Classiche Red Book, manufacturer’s literature, service records, and Netherlands registration. Introduced at 1975 Paris Motor Show, the 308 GTB featured Pininfarina-styled bodywork constructed of glass-reinforced plastic over a tubular steel chassis. Just 808 fiberglass-bodied vetroresina cars were produced by Carrozzeria Scaglietti before the switch to steel body panels in June 1977. This example was finished from the factory in Azzurro Metallizzato and was refinished in 2022. Exterior details include pop-up headlights, a driver-side mirror, and a vented decklid. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. Silver 14″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin tires that were mounted in 2022. The car features a fully independent suspension with double wishbones front and rear, and stopping power is provided by ventilated discs at each corner. The cockpit features bolstered seats upholstered in beige (3218) leather along with matching door panels and blue carpeting. Equipment includes air conditioning, electric windows, and a gated shifter with a dogleg gear pattern. The leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel fronts Veglia instrumentation including a 280-km/h speedometer, a tachometer with a 7,700-rpm redline, and supplementary gauges. Additional readouts are mounted ahead of the shifter. The five-digit odometer shows 11k kilometers (~7k miles), approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 2.9-liter F106 quad-cam V8 was equipped with a dry-sump lubrication system for the European market and made approximately 250 horsepower when new. The seller states that the radiator was serviced in 2021, the thermostat was replaced in 2022, and the timing belts were replaced in February 2025. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The Ferrari Classiche red book dates from July 2024 and includes a technical sheet listing the original colors and delivery information. Manufacturer’s literature and service records will accompany the sale. The vehicle is being sold on its registration, which serves as the ownership document in the Netherlands. The registration lists the VIN as F106AB19847, which is a combination of the engine type designation with the chassis serial number. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
