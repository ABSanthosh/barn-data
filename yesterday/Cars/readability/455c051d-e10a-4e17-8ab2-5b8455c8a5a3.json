Powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six that drives the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle, the car has a GT Silver Metallic finish, a mechanical limited-slip differential, a front-axle lift system, a sport exhaust system, ceramic-composite brakes, LED headlights, rear-axle steering, a backup camera, 20″ and 21″ center-locking wheels, Porsche Communication Management, the Chrono Package, a Bose sound system, automatic climate control, and cruise control. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, this 992 GT3 has 8k miles and is now offered with the owner’s manual, service records, spare parts, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title. The car is finished in GT Silver Metallic, and its rear swan-neck-hinged wing was removed using a FabSpeed wing delete kit in December 2024. The factory wing is included in the sale. Exterior details include LED headlights, a rear fog light, a backup camera, side graphics, Fabspeed rear wing mount covers, and dual center-exit exhaust outlets. Paint chips are located on the front end. Satin Black-finished 20″ front and 21″ rear GT3 center-lock wheels are mounted with Goodyear Eagle F1 tires. Stopping power is provided by Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) with cross-drilled and ventilated discs at each corner. The car is equipped with a front-axle lift system and rear-axle steering. A brake fluid flush was performed and the tires were replaced in September 2024. The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are trimmed in black leather with plaid inserts, “GT3” embroidery on the headrests, Racing Yellow seatbelts, and contrasting stitching that extends to the center console and door panels. A fire extinguisher is mounted in the passenger footwell, and additional appointments include Porsche Communication Management infotainment, a Bose sound system, automatic climate control, and cruise control. The removed seat inserts are included in the sale. The GT3 sports steering wheel features a vehicle configuration dial and frames a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline as well as a digital speed readout and dual adjustable TFT screens. A stopwatch is mounted atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 8k miles. The 4.0-liter flat-six features direct fuel injection, VarioCam variable valve timing, dry-sump lubrication, and individual throttle bodies. It was rated at 502 horsepower and 346 lb-ft of torque. The car was optioned with a sport exhaust system and an extended range 23.7-gallon fuel tank. An oil change was performed and the air filters and spark plugs were replaced in September 2024, and the car passed an emissions inspection in October 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle with a mechanical limited-slip differential. Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery.
