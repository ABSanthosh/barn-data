  "text": "Nissan appears to be a huge fan of the Xpeng P7 because they've basically copied it November 15, 2024 at 19:20 by Michael Gauthier Dongfeng Nissan has used the Guangzhou Auto Show to introduce the new N7. The model will be launched in China next year and ride on a new modular architecture. It will feature a semi-autonomous driving system and AI zero-pressure cloud cushion seats. Nissan is an electric vehicle pioneer, but you’d be hard pressed to tell by their American lineup which consists of the Ariya as well as the aging Leaf. Overseas, however, things get far more interesting. That trend continues today as Dongfeng Nissan has introduced the new N7 at the Guangzhou Auto Show. More: Nissan Delays U.S. Built Electric Sedans, Plans Rogue-Sized EV Previewed by the Epoch concept, the mid-size sedan model features a sleek and surprisingly generic design that closely mirrors the Xpeng P7. The front end is clean and modern featuring a slender light bar and fang-like headlights. They’re joined by a wide lower intake and what appears to be an illuminated Nissan logo. Further back, we can see flowing bodywork, flush-mounted door handles, and an expansive greenhouse. Designers also gave the car gloss black accents, a rear light bar, and two-tone wheels. In terms of size, the sedan measures 194.1 inches (4,930 mm) long, 74.6 inches (1,895 mm) wide, and 58.5 inches (1,487 mm) tall with a wheelbase that spans 114.8 inches (2,915 mm). That means the N7 is 2 inches (50 mm) longer than the P7, but has 3.3 inches (83 mm) less between the wheels. Nissan didn’t release interior pictures, but the sedan will be offered with “AI zero-pressure cloud cushion seats.” These are covered in a “silk-smooth” material and feature an adaptive posture system, which appears to adjust the seat based on data from 49 sensors. We can expect to learn more next year, though Nissan says the car rides on a new modular architecture that was designed exclusively for electrified vehicles. The company has also partnered with Momenta to offer a semi-autonomous driving system called Navigate on Autopilot.",
