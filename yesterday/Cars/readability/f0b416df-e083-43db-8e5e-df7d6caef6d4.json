  "text": "Are the heavy pickup's aluminum wheels not up to the task of supporting it, or is this an isolated incident? 48 seconds ago by Brad Anderson Two videos on TikTok show the left-hand side wheels on a Cybertruck that broke, likely after an impact. This has led some to question their integrity, with the person who uploaded the clips suggesting that a recall is in order. Few cars have ever divided opinions quite like the Tesla Cybertruck. Its polarizing design isn’t even up for debate—some love its sci-fi aesthetic, while others can’t stand its unpolished looks comparing it with a child’s drawing brought to life. Regardless of which side you’re on, there’s no denying that it has helped pave the way for other electric pickups. However, it’s also proven to be riddled with problems and videos recently shared to TikTok appear to suggest the wheels might be more fragile than expected. Earlier in the year, Tesla had to fix the standard aero covers on the Cybertruck’s wheels after it was revealed they were chewing into the tire sidewall. However, this latest potential problem isn’t related to the wheel covers, but instead the alloy rims themselves. More specifically, the wheels of this Cybertruck have shattered in a rather bizarre way, leading to speculation that they may not be as durable as they should be. Read: Sixth Time The Charm? Tesla Cybertruck Recalled Over Loss Of Drive Power It’s unclear what exactly caused the wheels to snap off like that. Some believe it could have been caused by a pothole, though this type of damage seems unlikely to result from something so minor. Other viewers speculate that the impact may have been with the concrete wall visible in the videos, but one would have expected more damage to the side of the car if this was the case. What’s clear is the extent of the damage. Many of the spokes on the front wheel have broken off and cracks are visible around the central part that connects to the hub. The damage done to the rear wheel is even more extensive, as the entire rim has broken off from the hub, except for some material around the lug nuts. It could be that the wheels of the Cybertruck are made from cast aluminum. Most cars on the market leave the factory with cast aluminum wheels as they are relatively inexpensive, but inconsistencies in the materials used during the manufacturing process can make them weak. More premium rims are forged and, in addition to being much stronger, are also significantly lighter. Perhaps one of the reasons why the rims of this Cybertruck failed so spectacularly is because the electric pickup weighs over 6,600 lbs in its lightest configuration, or more than 3,000 kg, which puts extra stress on some components, such as the wheels and tires. The person who posted the two videos on TikTok writes that the Tesla has a problem and should be recalled. However, without any more info, it’s impossible to determine whether this is a widespread issue impacting other Cybertrucks too or not. Image Credit: jordan8tatum / TikTok",
