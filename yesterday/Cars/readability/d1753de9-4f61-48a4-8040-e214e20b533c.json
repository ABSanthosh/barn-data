The driver tried to stop the burglar by trapping him on a narrow residential road. The thief crashed into the rental truck during the dramatic pursuit, causing significant damage. The Tesla Cybertruck is a spectacle on wheels—a massive, angular slab that looks more suited to the set of a sci-fi film than the local Walmart parking lot. But it’s not just about turning heads; as one Florida man found out, it can also be a weapon of vigilante justice. When an unsuspecting owner rented his Cybertruck out through Turo he had no idea that his ride would end up in the middle of a high-stakes confrontation with a porch pirate. The incident happened in Florida close to the renters home in Brooksville. “About to find out how good TURO’s insurance is… Yesterday my renter saw a porch pirate running to car with his box, accelerated and crashed into said porch pirate making a sandwich with the burglar’s car and a tree,” said the owner, Stefen Phelps, on Facebook. More: Cybertruck Shames Lamborghini In 5-Second Street Race, And Police Aren’t Happy Video shows the moment when the renter drove up toward his house and saw the pirate leaving the porch before jumping into what looks like a Genesis G80 sedan. With basically zero hesitation, the Cybertruck driver accelerates up to the Genesis, gets beside it, and keeps it from successfully turning left, the only direction available on that particular road. With nowhere else to go, the Genesis driver fails to slow down in time and hits a tree next to the road. In the process, the Cybertruck driver ended up in a bad position behind the Genesis and also couldn’t stop in time to avoid hitting the sedan. The resulting damage is significant to the Cybertruck. The hood, quarter panel, front bumper, and more are significantly impacted. According to Phelps, Turo Insurance is so far handling the case without issue. Videos Imgur As for the porch pirate and his accomplices, Phelps told Carscoops that “I believe there were three people in the car, and they’ve all been arrested. I gave the evidence to the police. They were looking for the last one mid-last week I assume they probably got him by now.” What remains unclear, however, is whether the Tesla driver might face charges any serious himself. Going full vigilante with a rented EV isn’t exactly a textbook example of self-defense, after all. Image Credit: Stefen Phelps",
