  "text": "Cars \u0026 Bids The smartest thing to do with your money right now is probably to hold onto as much of it as possible until we get a better idea of what's actually happening with the economy, but at the same time, no one has ever accused enthusiasts of being smart with their money. After all, even the few cars that do appreciate rarely beat the stock market, and that doesn't even include all the other money you have to spend to keep it on the road. If you happen to be looking to do something illogical with your money, though, why not spend some of it on a V8-powered custom buggy that makes a claimed 400 horsepower and is also titled for street use? I mean, do you need this thing? Absolutely not. But also, you absolutely need this thing. Other cars have roofs, airbags, crumple zones and all those other things that keep you safe, but how are you supposed to have any fun if you also play it safe? Much to Peter Thiel's chagrin, no one can possibly live forever, so we might as well get the most out of the short lives we're forced to lead. And what's going to add more joy to your life — a fully funded 401k or a 400 hp dune buggy that's allegedly street legal in Michigan? I think we both know the answer to that. 2013 Reboot Buggy Cars \u0026 Bids If this looks different from the buggies you usually see, that's because it was designed and built by a Michigan artist named Joey Ruiter. The listing claims it was designed to be as quick and easy to repair as possible while also offering a mid-mounted Chevrolet-sourced 6.3-liter V8, 25 inches of wheel travel, four tires and not much else. But while you could argue the automatic transmission could be better in certain off-road situations, it's still a little disappointing to see there's no manual. Even if three pedals made it objectively worse, it would probably make subjectively better, and that's what matters most. Will you survive a crash behind the wheel of this thing? That's between you, your surgeons, and your insurance company. Will you have the time of your life up until that point? Heck yeah, you will. And anyone who refuses to go for a ride was never a true friend in the first place, and I bet they hate having fun, too. You don't need them anyway. Not with a V8-powered custom buggy to drive, which again, is allegedly legal to do in Michigan. Just, I don't know, maybe wear a helmet? Not that Michigan would care about that, either.",
