Finished in Shadow Black with exposed carbon-fiber stripes over black Alcantara upholstery, it is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. The car is further equipped with an Akrapovič titanium exhaust system, Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, butterfly doors, a retractable active rear wing, a rear diffuser, and gloss carbon-fiber exterior trim. This Ford GT was purchased by the owner in 2024 and is now offered on dealer consignment with a window sticker, a car cover, the owner’s manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title. The Chris Svensson-designed second-generation GT debuted at the 2015 North American International Auto Show and entered production in December 2016 at Multimatic’s Markham, Ontario, assembly facility. This example is finished in Shadow Black with exposed carbon-fiber stripes and mirror caps. The car features the Exterior Carbon Fiber and Carbon Graphics packages and additional details include LED headlights, a lightweight Gorilla Glass windshield, butterfly doors, a retractable active rear wing, LED taillights, a rear diffuser, and carbon-fiber exterior trim. XPEL paint protection film and ClearPlex windshield-protection film were applied in 2023, at which time GT aero tunnel screens were fitted. The GT features a carbon-fiber monocoque structure bolted to front and rear aluminum subframes that serve as stressed members for the hydraulically adjustable pushrod suspension system. Variable ride height, front-axle lift system, selectable driving modes, and launch control are standard features. Staggered-width 20″ gloss carbon-fiber wheels feature titanium lug nuts and are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. Braking is handled by red-painted Brembo six-piston monoblock calipers over 15.5” carbon-ceramic discs up front, while four-piston calipers are mounted over 14.1” units out back. The cabin features black Alcantara over the Sparco seats with manually reclining carbon-fiber shells. Exposed carbon fiber is visible on the door panels. The fixed-position driver seat is paired with an adjustable pedal box and steering column, and additional equipment includes automatic climate control, six-point harness anchors, and a touchscreen infotainment system. XPEL protection film is affixed to the exposed carbon-fiber trim at the rear of the center console and both door sills. The Alcantara-wrapped multi-function steering wheel fronts paddle shifters and a configurable digital instrument panel. The digital odometer indicates 23 miles. The mid-mounted twin-turbocharged 3.5L EcoBoost V6 features a carbon-fiber engine cover and was factory rated at 660 horsepower and 550 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Getrag seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. Carbon-fiber aero panels fitted fore and aft both were wrapped with XPEL paint protection film in 2023. Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery. The window sticker notes initital delivery to Price Ford of Simi Valley, California, as well as well as factory colors, equipment, and a total MSRP of $630,845. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. The California title carries a “Title Only” notation. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
