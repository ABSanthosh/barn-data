Only 46,000 Cybertrucks have been sold despite Musk’s much larger projections. Social media users spotted and posted about the Cybertruck towing stunt. You will never hear Tesla call the Cybertruck a flop, but by the company’s own projections, that’s exactly what it looks like. At one point, there were claims of nearly 2 million reservations for the electric pickup. As of March, however, Tesla had only built and sold about 46,000. The original plan was to produce 250,000 annually, and Elon Musk once suggested the company could move as many as 500,000 each year. However, it seems Tesla has found a good way to use those Cybertrucks it can’t sell. Read: What Happened To Musk’s 1 Million Cybertruck Reservations? Earlier this week, a motorcade of Cybertrucks was spotted cruising through Temple, Texas, and one of those Cybertrucks stood out. It was towing a trailer with a red Tesla Model Y in a glass capsule, proudly advertising the electric SUV as being ‘Made in Texas.’ Desperate times call for desperate measures, and it seems Tesla wants to ensure that as many people as possible can see the new Model Y in person. A Mobile Billboard, Tesla-Style A Cybertruck towing the new Model Y around is actually a pretty smart marketing tool. Plenty of car manufacturers pay big bucks to buy advertising space on massive billboards near highways, but Tesla has always shied away from typical marketing campaigns. In this case, it’s essentially towing around a giant billboard, except it’s not a picture of a car, but the car itself. The Model Y in question is painted in Ultra Red, too, which just so happens to be the best color that Tesla offers. Now, will the sight of a red Model Y Juniper convince Texans to buy a new Tesla? Who knows, but it’s a good way to drum up some attention for their latest EV. After all, there are already social media posts about it, and we’re writing about it, too. That’s more than can be said for most static billboards from legacy automakers, and it fits with Tesla’s long-running preference for unconventional marketing tactics.
