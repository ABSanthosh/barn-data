  "text": "Lucid makes some truly compelling electric vehicles, but affordability and variety have never been its strong suit. At least one of those issues will be resolved with the upcoming Gravity SUV, which will expand Lucid’s product offerings to two vehicles. The automaker recently announced pricing for the SUV, and while the starting numbers are less than the Air sedan’s initial pricing, it’s still one expensive EV. The 2025 Lucid Gravity starts at $79,900 for the Touring trim, but eager buyers can snag the Grand Touring model a little earlier for $94,900. Lucid will open the order books next week on November 7, so it’s time to get your financial affairs in order if you want one.That said, Lucid released the most expensive variants of the Air sedan first, before reducing the price in later models. The same would likely be true for the Gravity, though it probably won’t come down in price too far, given its competition. Luxury SUVs, even gas models, easily crest the $100,000 mark, so it’s unlikely that we’ll see a sub-$60,000 Gravity any time soon. The first Gravity deliveries will go to current Lucid owners looking to upgrade to an SUV, but the automaker can’t afford long delays or delivery timelines. It has had to lean on its Saudi Arabian investors as it hemorrhages cash, making the Gravity’s release a very big deal that could be a turning point for the company.[Images: Lucid]Become a TTAC insider.
