  "description": "Toyota is developing a new hybrid engine for its performance sub-brand, Gazoo Racing (GR), which will give its future models a chance to sell in markets with strict emissions regulations. Our sister publication, Autocar UK, reports that the next generation of sports cars from Toyota GR will use a hybrid powertrain based on a new engine that is being tested. New Toyota 2.0-litre turbo-petrol can support plug-in and mild-hybrid setups New hybrid powertrain will be used in motorsport as well New Toyota hybrid powertrain details Based on new 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo-petrol engine The hybrid system is based on the new 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbocharged engine (codenamed G20E), which was tested and showcased in the mid-engined GR Yaris M Concept. The engine can support both plug-in hybrid and mild hybrid setups and features a shorter piston stroke than Toyota’s current engines, making it smaller and lighter. Technical specifications of the engine are yet to be revealed, but we have reported that outputs of over 400hp and 500Nm are expected in the road-going version. In motorsport applications, over 600hp is expected from the G20E engine. Small size and lightweight aid hybridisation Weight is an important factor as a hybrid element can be fitted with minimal penalty, as suggested by Hiroyuki Yamada, a GR engineer working on the project. He added, “We can use hybrid for future cars [which use this engine]. We will use it in our motorsport activities in the future because of emissions. This technology we create will be applied to both motorsport and passenger [car] engines. In the future, we want a more fuel-efficient engine [for GR cars].” The plan to fit GR models with hybrid power has been long mooted by Toyota. In 2023, chief technology officer Hiroki Nakajima told Autocar UK, “Hybrid systems are always a good solution for environmental cars, not just for passenger cars but for sporty cars as well.” New Toyota MR2 could be previewed by M Concept New Toyota MR2 production green-lit in May 2024 As mentioned above, the heavily modified GR Yaris, which Toyota called the M Concept, gets the new G20E engine in its mid-ship and comes with a four-wheel drive system. It should be noted that Toyota states that the M Concept is just a test bed for the new engine. However, given the cost of developing a mid-engine, four-wheel-drive configuration, it is likely to enter production and become the new MR2. In fact, Autocar UK reports that the mid-engined sports car was green-lit for production last May. In terms of design, the all-new MR2 will likely take inspiration from the 2023 FT-Se concept.
