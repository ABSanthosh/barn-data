Equipment includes a front-axle lift system, four-wheel steering, carbon-ceramic brakes, 20″ forged racing wheels finished in matte black, adaptive front lights, airbrushed Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, a body-color engine cover, a backup camera, and carbon-fiber exterior and interior trim. Additional interior appointments include a Hi-Fi sound system, a passenger-side display, and aluminum pedals and footrests. This 812 Competizione is now offered on dealer consignment with a window sticker, a Ferrari Classiche yellow book, factory literature, a battery tender, a car cover, a clean Carfax report, and an Arizona title. The track-focused Competizione and open-topped Competizione A joined the 812 model lineup for 2022. Based on the 812 Superfast, the Competizione features revised aero equipment including a model-specific rear diffuser and rear-spoiler profile as well as a ribbed body-color engine cover with an integrated rear-view camera that replaces the rear window. This example was delivered from the factory in Extra Range Nerotto Lucido with Bianco Sanae stripes that extend over the hood to the door tops. Equipment includes adaptive LED headlights, LED taillights, airbrushed Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, parking sensors, and exposed carbon-fiber on the front air intakes, splitter, and rear diffuser. The 20″ matte black-finished forged racing wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires measuring 275/35 up front and 315/35 out back. The car is equipped with a Virtual Short Wheelbase four-wheel-steering system, a magnetorheological suspension, and an optional front-axle suspension lift system. The 812 Competizione incorporates front brake calipers with integrated cooling ducts sourced from the SF90. All four calipers are finished in gloss black, and they are mounted over cross-drilled carbon-ceramic rotors. The cockpit features black Alcantara upholstery, and it houses large-sized racing seats trimmed in Blu Jeans Aunde fabric with Oatmeal ultrasuede stripes. Blu Jean Aunde extends to the instrument surround, dash vents, and rear luggage straps, while exposed carbon-fiber trim accents the dashboard, center console, and parcel shelf. Additional equipment includes a surround-view camera system, a JBL Hi-Fi sound system, a passenger display, navigation, dual-zone automatic climate control, racing seat lifters, trefoil-design floormats, and drilled aluminum pedals and footrests. A digital rear-view mirror is standard equipment on 812 Competizione models. The carbon-fiber steering wheel features grips trimmed in multi-layer black Alcantara as well as gloss Bianco Sanae stripes at 12 o’clock. It features integrated LED shift lights, a manettino drive-mode selector, and an ignition button, and it fronts carbon-fiber paddle shifters. Instrumentation includes a center-mounted tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline as well as dual multi-function configurable TFT LCD screens. The digital odometer indicates 60 miles. Gloss carbon-fiber door sills feature tricolore graphics and Tailor Made branding. The 6.5-liter F140 HB V12 is mounted aft of the front axle and was revised for Competizione models with titanium connecting rods, a lighter crankshaft, a revised cylinder head with finger-follower actuated valves, a redesigned oil tank, and friction-reducing carbon coating across several internal components. Output was factory rated at 819 horsepower and 510 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle and Ferrari’s E-Diff limited-slip differential. The Competizione features a revised exhaust system that incorporates a gasoline particulate filter, two additional resonators, and a model-specific tailpipe design. The Personalization Specifications plaque in the rear cargo area lists factory colors and equipment as well as Tailor Made modifications. The window sticker is presented in the gallery, and it shows initial delivery to Scottsdale Ferrari, as well as a total suggested retail price of $820,538. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. There is currently a lien on the car, which will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the next owner.
