  "text": "I believe I've written about this before, but as much as I love driving a stick, I've decided, as I've gotten older, than three-pedal transmissions need to be reserved for special situations. If it's a sporty car, including a sport sedan? Yes, please. Make my Ford Mustang, my Volkswagen GTI, my Honda Civic Si, et cetera, a manual.Off-roaders, too -- I like that Ford sells a Bronco manual, as an example.But do I want a manual in a Camry? Not unless that Camry has been giving a deep TRD treatment.Do I want it in a work truck? Probably not.Besides, not all manuals are good. I've driven some that were terrible. So have you.Just as an aside -- I couldn't even find a pic of a manual Hyundai Elantra N on the company's own media Web site. Which is why the image above is from the 2020 Hyundai Veloster N. I still believe the manual should be saved, but only for certain niches.What about you? Do you want a manual in the year 2025? Or have you decided an automatic, perhaps one with paddles, is good enough?Sound off below.[Image: Hyundai]Become a TTAC insider.
