  "text": "Published:  April 11th, 2025 Dodge is now offering heavy discounts on the all-electric Charger Daytona. Dealer bulletins have indicated that the brand is discounting the model by $6,500. This is despite the Daytona being the brand’s new halo vehicle and comes after we’ve seen numerous dealer markdowns to address a lack of demand and Stellantis offering employee discounts to the public.News of the discounts stems from CarsDirect and pertains to the 2025 model year. However, the deals available on 2024 model year vehicles (which still look to be widely available) are even greater. Last month, the outlet reported discounts upwards of $12,500 in certain parts of the country. From CarsDirect:Just as before, Stellantis Financing continues to offer a special financing rate of 1.9% APR for 72 months, but the offers can’t be combined. Shoppers who choose to lease a Charger Daytona EV can get $7,500 in lease cash from Stellantis Financial.For some shoppers, being able to get a $6,500 discount or 1.9 [percent] APR financing for 72 months could make the 2025 Dodge Charger Daytona EV a more appealing option to purchase than before.While Dodge has introduced a new discount for the 2025 Charger Daytona, the 2024 model continues to be the best deal. Offers for the EV, though, are pretty confusing.Nationally, shoppers can choose between four major deals. The first one includes 0 [percent] APR financing for 72 months plus $3,000 in bonus cash. The second deal is $7,500 National Retail Consumer Cash in addition to $3,000 in bonus cash. Shoppers looking to lease the EV can get $7,500 in lease cash plus $6,000 in bonus cash. Lastly, there’s a $2,000 Conquest Bonus Cash deal in select regions like the West Coast.However, that doesn’t begin to paint the whole picture. According to The Autopian (h/t The Drive), there are examples of the 2025 Dodge Charger Daytona R/T listing for $32,000 below MSRP. Your author even inquired with a couple of local dealers, both of which were prepared to take $9,000 off the current model year straight away. The Charger Daytona EV, and arguably the way Stellantis has handled the Dodge brand in general under former CEO Carlos Tavares, should be a cautionary tale for the rest of the industry. At this point, it’s crystal clear that Stellantis either didn’t understand the North American market or made Dodge such a low priority that leadership wasn't worried about the fate of the marquee. An extravagantly priced all-electric vehicle was never going to appeal to a customer base that historically prized affordable V8 motors and simple, traditional designs. But we’ve seen similar trends throughout the industry. Companies are offering the kinds of vehicle they want to sell, rather than the type of vehicle consumers want to purchase. There is likewise a clear limit to how far upmarket companies can reach without hurting themselves. A century ago, automakers were similarly convinced that the path forward was to collectively focus on extravagant and complicated luxury cars carrying exceptionally high price tags. The Great Depression quickly put an end to that way of thinking by quickly bankrupting roughly half of the auto industry. Only the most resilient brands persisted, many of which also pivoted toward — or were already building — affordable vehicles in order to survive. With a recession looming and clear evidence that a meaningful portion of shoppers now priced out of the new-vehicle market, today’s automakers would be wise to consider the past before they’re caught up in a bleak future they cannot control.

More by Matt Posky Published April 11th, 2025 6:00 PM Comments Join the conversation The only thing Daimler wanted from Chrysler were those sweet, sweet truck and Jeep profits. Aside from the big cars, it was easy to tell as they did very little to improve the regular line up. I feel they intentionally knee-capped Chrysler Corporation by saddling them with weird Daimler-Chrysler-Mitsubishi mashups like the Caliber, Sebring and Avenger for the mainstream cars. Honestly, I have no idea what Cerberus was doing owning an automobile manufacturing company and that REALLY showed. Enter Sergio Marchionne and Fiat, as supposed White Knights. What did they really want? Those sweet, sweet truck and Jeep profits. They did some things to enhance the rest of the lineup, but at the same time typecast them into specific roles that there was no logical transition to newer ideas. A clue should have been the abysmally bad launch of the Dart. So, the Elkanns get tired of running a manufacturing business and decide to merge FCA with PSA.What did PSA really want? Those sweet, sweet truck and Jeep profits. But they completely wasted time launching new product and did an ever better job of screwing up a car launch (Hornet) than FCA did launching the Dart. Then, they managed to piss off the entire audience for their muscle cars by playing games with “Final Call” and other spurious editions, only to magically find even MORE Hemi Durangos in the corner of the Mexican plant somewhere. To top that off, they launch an EV named Charger. It’s horrendously over priced, launched into a market segment that seems to be somewhat hostile to EVs. It seems as if they were trying to mess this up so badly in order to shutter the Dodge and Chrysler divisions, only to keep…Those sweet, sweet truck and Jeep profits. Daimler didnt want anything except their fat bank account, which they drained to save Mercedes and then offloaded the carcass. At time of buy out Chrysler was the most profitable car company in the world and Mercedes was going down the drain due to horrid quality and they were running out of money. A 2 hours ago Chrysler hit a home run with the look of the facelifted 200 and Pacifica. All they had to do at that time is make a competitive 3-row and 2row suv with the same styling and profit. Even now, 10 years later they could easily badge engineer some Peugeot 3008’s and 5008’s and do better than they are now.",

Before joining TTAC, Matt spent a decade working for marketing and research firms based in NYC. Clients included several of the world’s largest automakers, global tire brands, and aftermarket part suppliers. Dissatisfied, he pivoted to writing about cars. Since then, he has become an ardent supporter of the right-to-repair movement, been interviewed about the automotive sector by national broadcasts, participated in a few amateur rallying events, and driven more rental cars than anyone ever should.

Aside from the big cars, it was easy to tell as they did very little to improve the regular line up.

What did they really want? Those sweet, sweet truck and Jeep profits. They did some things to enhance the rest of the lineup, but at the same time typecast them into specific roles that there was no logical transition to newer ideas. A clue should have been the abysmally bad launch of the Dart. So, the Elkanns get tired of running a manufacturing business and decide to merge FCA with PSA.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat did PSA really want? Those sweet, sweet truck and Jeep profits. But they completely wasted time launching new product and did an ever better job of screwing up a car launch (Hornet) than FCA did launching the Dart. Then, they managed to piss off the entire audience for their muscle cars by playing games with “Final Call” and other spurious editions, only to magically find even MORE Hemi Durangos in the corner of the Mexican plant somewhere. To top that off, they launch an EV named Charger. It’s horrendously over priced, launched into a market segment that seems to be somewhat hostile to EVs. It seems as if they were trying to mess this up so badly in order to shutter the Dodge and Chrysler divisions, only to keep…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose sweet, sweet truck and Jeep profits.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n    \n            \n    \n    \n            \n        \u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e                \u003cul\u003e\n                \u003cli id=\"cid-10582264\" data-c_writer_id=\"65713414\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv data-comment-id=\"10582264\" data-comment-type=\"reply\" data-comment-writer=\"65713414\" data-comment-writer-name=\"Frank\" data-has-replies=\"\"\u003e\n            \n        \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n            \n            \u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eDaimler didnt want anything except their fat bank account, which they drained to save Mercedes and then offloaded the carcass.
