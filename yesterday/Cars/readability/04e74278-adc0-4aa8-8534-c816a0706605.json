  "description": "The Ford Mustang GTD has set a new lap record at the Nürburgring, completing the 20.8km-long track in just 6 minutes and 57.68 seconds. This makes it the fastest American road car to conquer this tough circuit, surpassing the previous record set by Porsche's 911 GT3 four years ago by 2.2 seconds. However, several other German cars have bested the Mustang's time earlier. GTD is the most extreme Mustang yet, surpassing even the Ford GT It’s the sixth vehicle in its class to break the seven-minute barrier Mercedes-AMG One is the fastest yet at the Nurburgring Faster cars around the ‘Ring The Mustang GTD’s time is surely respectable, but it is still behind the 911 GT3 with the Manthey Racing Performance Kit (6min 55.737sec), the 911 GT3 RS (6min 49.328sec), the Mercedes-AMG GT Black Series (6min 48.047sec), and the previous-generation Porsche 911 GT2 RS modified by Manthey (6min 43.300sec). The standout, however, has been the Mercedes-AMG One, which finished the lap a whole 28.595 seconds quicker than the Ford, clocking in at 6 minutes and 29.09 seconds. This was a 6.84 percent faster performance by the current road-car record-holder at the track. Mustang GTD engine, specs and design Ford's track-focused Mustang boasts a 5.2-litre V8 engine, which packs a massive 826hp, producing 63 percent more power than the 506hp-Mustang Dark Horse. It comes equipped with race-ready modifications like dry-sump lubrication and an active-valve exhaust system. Further, its chassis also sees major upgrades with a lower and wider stance, complemented by carbon-ceramic Brembo brakes for better track handling. “The team behind Mustang GTD took what we’ve learned from decades on the track and engineered a Mustang that can compete with the world’s best supercars,” said Ford president and CEO Jim Farley. In terms of design, the GTD draws heavily from its racing equivalent, the Mustang GT3, featuring an aggressive body kit with broad wheel arches, cooling ducts for the engine and brakes, and a large rear spoiler. The Mustang GTD was only available for purchase through a special application process, which ended on July 19. Ford plans to attempt another lap next year to further improve the GTD's record, potentially rivalling the Porsche 911 GT3.
