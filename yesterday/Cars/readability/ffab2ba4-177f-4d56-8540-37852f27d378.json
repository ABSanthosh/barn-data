  "description": "This 1973 Ford Bronco is one of a limited number of Baja models built by Ford from 1971 to 1975 to commemorate victories in the Baja 500 and Baja 1000 by Bill Stroppe-prepared Broncos, and it is reported to be one of a handful finished in a special-order color rather than the standard red, white, and blue Baja Bronco paint scheme. It was also specified with the full Baja Bronco conversion package, which added dual shocks all around, 15x8.5\" wheels, a roll bar, rubberized steering wheel, rear fender flares, and a branded spare tire cover and decals. A Stroppe auxiliary transmission cooler was also installed at the Stroppe facility during the conversion. The truck was sold new through Friendly Ford of Fresno, California, and remained with the first owner in the Fresno area until his passing in 2015. The current owner purchased the truck in 2017, and work completed in 2020 included re-trimming the Parchment vinyl seats, replacing the floor pans, overhauling the suspension and power steering system, and rebuilding the 302ci V8, the three-speed automatic transmission, and the dual-range transfer case. This Baja Bronco is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a Deluxe Marti Report, letters from Baja Broncos Unlimited, service records since the 1970s, and a clean California title in the owner's name.",

This Baja Bronco is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a Deluxe Marti Report, letters from Baja Broncos Unlimited, service records since the 1970s, and a clean California title in the owner’s name. The truck is finished in metallic green with a white removable hardtop and rear fender flares, and it retains its “Baja by Stroppe” fender badges. The body-mount bushings were replaced and the driver’s door handle was repaired in 2020. Equipment includes a receiver hitch, a swing-away rear tire carrier, a “Baja Bronco” spare tire cover, and chrome bumpers with front guards. The right-rear quarter panel has been painted at some point, and dings, scratches, and chips are visible around the body. Slotted 15″ alloy wheels are mounted with 31×10.5″ BFGoodrich Radial Mud-Terrain T/A tires. Chassis refurbishment in 2020 included rebuilding the power steering pump and gearbox, installing Bilstein shocks, and replacing the power steering hoses, brake hoses, springs, and suspension bushings. Braking is handled by four-wheel drums, and brake hoses were replaced in 2020. The cabin features front bucket seats and a rear bench trimmed in Parchment vinyl, and the seat foam and upholstery were replaced in 2021 along with the headliner. The floor pans were also replaced in 2021, and the interior was repainted, after which the cracked and worn floor liner was reinstalled. A Mitsubishi AM/FM/cassette stereo is mounted in the dash, and the four-point roll bar by Stroppe was re-padded and reinstalled. Instrumentation includes a 100-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges for amperage, fuel level, coolant temperature, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 15,759 miles, approximately 150 of which were added under current ownership. The 302ci V8 was rebuilt in 2020 and features a Holley four-barrel carburetor. The replacement dual exhaust system has an H-pipe as well as glasspack-style mufflers. Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case, both of which were rebuilt in 2020. The truck features limited-slip front and rear differentials. The Deluxe Marti Report indicates the truck was initially delivered to Friendly Ford of Fresno, California, and lists original colors, equipment, and production dates and statistics.
