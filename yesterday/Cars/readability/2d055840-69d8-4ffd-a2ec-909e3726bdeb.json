  "description": "This 1969 Ferrari Dino 206 GT is one of approximately 154 examples built during a year and a half of production and is one of two 206 GTs originally finished in Azzurro Metallizzato. Chassis 00310 was ordered new via Garage La Rotonda in Florence, Italy, in March 1968, and was completed on January 3, 1969, before being delivered to its first owner 25 days later. The car spent its first 47 years based in Lucca, Italy, the first 29 of which were with its original owner, who passed it on to the stewardship of his daughter in 1998. After being sold to its next owner in Rome, Italy, in 2016, the car underwent a refurbishment that was completed in early 2018 and included a repaint of the aluminum body in its original shade. It was then purchased by the seller in December 2023 and imported to the US. Power is provided by a mid-mounted 2.0L quad-cam V6 that breathes through triple Weber 40 DCN carburetors and is mated to a five-speed manual transaxle. Additional features include center-lock Cromodora magnesium-alloy wheels, servo-assisted ventilated disc brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, an external fuel-filler cap, black vinyl interior upholstery with blue cloth seat inserts, and a wood-rimmed steering wheel. This 206 GT is now offered in Carpinteria, California, with original order documents, correspondence between Ferrari and the original owner, its original Italian registration booklet, a Matthias Bartz report, a Marcel Massini report, refurbishment photos, owner’s manuals, and a clean Montana title in the name of the seller’s LLC.",

Power is provided by a mid-mounted 2.0L quad-cam V6 that breathes through triple Weber 40 DCN carburetors and is mated to a five-speed manual transaxle. Additional features include center-lock Cromodora magnesium-alloy wheels, servo-assisted ventilated disc brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, an external fuel-filler cap, black vinyl interior upholstery with blue cloth seat inserts, and a wood-rimmed steering wheel. This 206 GT is now offered in Carpinteria, California, with original order documents, correspondence between Ferrari and the original owner, its original Italian registration booklet, a Matthias Bartz report, a Marcel Massini report, refurbishment photos, owner’s manuals, and a clean Montana title in the name of the seller’s LLC. The 206 GT first appeared in prototype form at the 1965 Paris Auto Salon and was followed by revised concepts at the 1966 and 1967 Turin Motor Shows before entering production in early 1968 as Ferrari’s first road-going mid-engined car. The model featured a tubular steel chassis wrapped in all-aluminum bodywork designed by Pininfarina and hand-built by Scaglietti. The 206 GT variant’s 2,280mm wheelbase was 60mm shorter than that of the 246 GT that superseded it in 1969. This example’s aluminum body was stripped to bare metal before being refinished in its original shade of Azzurro Metallizzato (106-A-32) during the refurbishment performed between 2017 and 2018 by Rosso Monza in Arcore, Italy. Features include open recessed headlights, an external alloy fuel-filler cap, six vents on each side of the engine decklid, an external trunk button, and quad exhaust outlets. Italian number plates are in place at front and rear and match the number listed in the car’s original registration booklet. Magnesium alloy Cromodora wheels are secured by three-eared knock-offs and are wrapped in 205/70VR14 Michelin XWX tires, as is a matching spare housed in the front compartment. Stopping is handled by servo-assisted Girling ventilated disc brakes at each corner. The cabin houses fixed-back seating for two trimmed in black vinyl with ribbed blue cloth inserts, while black vinyl covers the door panels, center tunnel, and rear bulkhead, the latter of which integrates fixed headrests. Additional interior features include “mouse fur” dashboard trim, replacement gray carpeting, Parachute shoulder belts, a sill-mounted grab handle on the passenger side, a full-width glovebox door, a passenger-side footrest, and a gated shifter with a black knob distinct to the 206 GT. The wood-rimmed steering wheel sits ahead of Veglia Borletti instrumentation including a 270-km/h speedometer, a tachometer with an 8k-rpm redline, a clock, and gauges monitoring oil temperature, coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel level, and amperage. The five-digit odometer shows 72k kilometers (~45k miles), less than 500 of which have been added under current ownership. The 2.0-liter Tipo 135B V6 features an alloy block with a 65° angle between cylinder banks, cast-iron cylinder liners, and alloy cylinder heads with hemispherical combustion chambers, cast-iron valve seats, and dual overhead camshafts on each bank. A Magneti Marelli ignition system made the 206 GT Ferrari’s first offering with electronic ignition, while induction is through triple Weber 40 DCN carburetors. The engine is said to have been overhauled during the 2017-2018 refurbishment. Power is sent to the rear wheels via an all-synchromesh five-speed manual transaxle that is also said to have been overhauled between 2017 and 2018. Engine number 0005082 is shown stamped on the block above and matches the number listed on the Marcel Massini and Matthias Bartz reports. Transaxle number 107 is shown stamped on the gearbox in the gallery, while Scaglietti body number 104 is shown stamped or written on the various trim pieces when removed during the refurbishment. Correspondence from Ferrari on Dino letterhead dated January 30, 1968, references a May 1967 inquiry from the car’s original owner and directs the owner to place an order with Garage La Rotonda. An order sheet accompanied by a down-payment receipt dated March 10, 1968, is viewable in the gallery, as are the car’s original Carta di Circolazione per Autovettura, the car’s warranty booklet and other owner’s literature, correspondence from Ferrari regarding a mid-1970s service, the Marcel Massini and Matthias Bartz reports, correspondence from Bartz regarding production numbers specific to the car’s paint color, and images from the 2017-2018 refurbishment.
