  "text": "If artificial intelligence worries you this video might send you over the edge May 22, 2025 at 21:12 by Stephen Rivers A viral video of an auto show is fully AI-generated and disturbingly realistic throughout. The clip runs over a minute and includes interviews with fake people and background cars. It raises questions about reality as AI convincingly recreates human events and emotions. Major auto shows used to be a huge deal. For decades, they were essential calendar events for automakers, journalists, and anyone with a pulse for chrome and horsepower. But in recent years, attendance has dropped, shows are shutting down, and people seem less interested. Of course, in a new video floating around online, it appears that vast swaths of mankind are taking in a new auto show somewhere on the globe. The only issue is that the entire thing is fake. In fact, it even starts out with a very clear hint that this isn’t real. “Welcome to a non-existent car show, ” says a person dressed as a host. “Let’s see some opinions.” From that point forward, we get over a minute of interviews with ‘people’ who talk about this show and the cars in it. More: Google’s Secret Weapon For Cars Is Finally Rolling Out Some express vivid joy, others concerns about safety, and still others simple happiness in their ability to attend. None of it is legitimate, though. The voices are AI, the people are AI, and all of the background objects, including the cars, are AI. Creator László Gaál posted the video on X. “Before you ask: yes, everything is AI here,” he said, later clarifying further that he’s using “single text prompts” per clip, and then these clips are edited together. He used two pieces of software, Veo3 and Google DeepMind, to build the video. Watch it below, it’s truly remarkable just how good it is. Before you ask: yes, everything is AI here. The video and sound both coming from a single text prompt using #Veo3 by @GoogleDeepMind .Whoever is cooking the model, let him cook! Congrats @Totemko and the team for the Google I/O live stream and the new Veo site! pic.twitter.com/sxZuvFU49s— László Gaál (@laszlogaal_) May 21, 2025 Impressive, With a Few Tells Still, it’s not a perfect clip. Notice that anything with clear writing on it, like the patches on the biker’s jacket, is misspelled. The hands, a known issue for AI, are good, but not perfect. In one clip, a man’s hand appears almost backward. In another, a hand drifts through the fabric of a pocket. That said, it’s still wildly impressive. The same goes for the random cars behind, though, those could easily fool your average consumer. As many of you have graciously noted, we’ve been cooking up some original video content here and there recently. I used to tell people that while AI is probably going to be capable of writing so well that it’ll put many of us out of a job, it wouldn’t be able to keep up with video. Welcome to the latest example of me being wrong.  Photo credit: László Gaál (or Google Veo3)",
