  "text": "First look at Jag’s brave new design direction reveals a mashup of E-Type, Range Rover and, er, Tesla Cybertruck influences December 2, 2024 at 20:00 by Chris Chilton Jaguar has given us our first taste of what to expect from the reinvented brand’s EV-only lineup coming in 2025. The Type 00 two-door concept will transform into a four-door sedan for production late next year, and be followed by two more EVs. Jag’s engineering team is targeting 478 miles (770km) WLTP and 430 miles (692 km) of EPA range. Finally we can stop talking about Jaguar’s new logos and get back to talking about its new cars. And there’s plenty to talk about because the automaker today revealed the Type 00 concept and it’s as polarizing as the new brand marks and fashion-show Instagram ads. Previously referred to as the Design Vision concept, the Type 00 (say ‘zero zero’) is a confidently modern two-door coupe that previews a four-door production GT set to debut in late 2025. ‘Type’ is a reference to Jag’s iconic E-Type and the recently axed F-Type, and the two zeroes refer to the EV’s lack of tailpipe emissions and its status as car zero in the reinvented automaker’s lineup. Related: In Wake Of Controversial Campaign, Jaguar Boss Said It Had To Shake Things Up Available technical details are few, but Jag does confirm that the car rides on its new JEA electric platform and that it’s targeting 478 miles (770km) WLTP and 430 miles (692 km) of EPA range. And if that’s not enough to complete your journey, you can add 200 miles (321 km) of range in 15 minutes. For info about charging speeds, motor specs and battery sizes we’ll have to wait. This month’s concept unveil at Miami Art Week was all about establishing the very different look of the next generation of Jaguars, and getting us comfortable with the idea of Jaguar as a true luxury brand, rather than a premium one. Gone is the mesh-filled, squircle-shaped radiator grille, something even the i-Pace EV featured, and in its place comes a starkly modern face with a slatted rectangle containing the controversial jaGuar lettering and flanked by two ultra-slim LED lights. The back end is equally industrial looking, the fat rear fenders separated by another rectangle filled with horizontal slats. This time the slats are slimmer and there are more of them, plus horizontal light bars top and bottom. And as predicted, the Type 00 has no rear window – the liftback hatch panel is the same Miami Pink color as the rest of the bodywork. Jaguar also showed a second car painted in London Blue, a reference to the brand’s British roots and its 1960s heyday, and also a nod to the pair of E-types that appeared at the sports car’s 1961 launch. Jag’s purposely limits specific mention of its most famous car to that reference, but the Type 00’s proportions, particularly evident in the cab-backwards profile and rear three-quarter views are clearly intended to remind us of the iconic E-type coupe, without falling into a retro rabbit hole. More: Jaguar EV Concept Says Bye-Bye Rear Window, Hello Air-Con Vents But there are also obvious hints of Range Rover in the design and it’s easy to see why JLR creative boss Gerry McGovern and his team would want to do that. Jaguar is part of JLR and has struggled to find sales and its own identity, two things Land Rover has had no trouble achieving. The Type 00 feels like the Range Rover coupe that Land Rover could never build using that branding. The brown-colored piece of trim ahead of the door contains pop-out cameras to help when parking, and is fashioned out of brass, a material that’s repeated on the interior on the steering wheel’s bottom spoke and a 3.2-meter (126 inches) spine running the length of the cabin. Other key materials are stone and textiles. Wood and leather? Sorry, that was old Jag. Notably missing from the interior images despite being a mainstay of every new car is any kind of digital screen. Jag says they’re hidden them in the dashboard and, like the stowage areas, glide out on electric power when needed. Drivers can also change the cabin lighting and look of the digital displays by retrieving one of three totems hidden behind a door on the front fender (the Range Rover-esque filler panel located just behind the 23-inch front wheel) and placing them inside the center console. That last bit is concept car nonsense, but much of what we can see on the Type 00 will transfer to the production sedan scheduled for reveal this time next year and on sale in the first half of 2026. And the same ideas and design language will show up on two more vehicles Jag will introduce before the end of the decade, at least one of which will be an SUV/crossover. What do you think of the Type 00? Is Jaguar heading in the right direction? Was it right to be so radical? Or has it signed its own death warrant? We want to hear your thoughts so drop a comment below.",
