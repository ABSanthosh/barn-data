  "text": "The officer involved apparently talked the suspect into a confession October 19, 2024 at 21:01 by Stephen Rivers An Arkansas law enforcement officer gave chase after a car came blazing past him at 134 mph. While he lost sight of the vehicle for several minutes, he then happened upon a parked BMW M4. During questioning, the BMW driver incriminated himself by admitting to speeding earlier. Honesty isn’t always easy to come by these days. Still, sometimes it’s found in the strangest places. That was especially true for a law enforcement officer from Arkansas after he questioned a BMW M4 driver. Despite no obligation to do so, the man at the wheel of the M4 admitted that he was guilty of passing the trooper at over 130 mph (210 km/h). Let’s rewind back to the beginning of this story. Late in the evening of October 5, Arkansas State Trooper Randall Schwab was sitting on the side of the highway when a car passed him at what was said to be 134 mph (216 km/h). Schwab gave chase but the car in question immediately shut its lights off and fled so fast that it exited Schwab’s line of sight almost immediately.

They surround the vehicle and begin asking the driver questions. He claims that he stopped to pull over and eat something. The officers take his license and documents and begin to investigate. Over an hour passes as officers try to find witnesses and evidence on their dash camera that this is indeed the same car that sped past them. Then, despite acknowledging on body camera (and away from the BMW driver) that they cannot confirm what car it was based on the dashcam footage, they tell the driver that they “have what they need.” They tell the driver that, based on his answers, he’s going to be “in a lot of trouble,” and then that “your black license plate is a dead giveaway. Your taillights are a dead giveaway. My video shows me all that stuff,” says officer Schwab. Moments later, the suspect confesses that indeed it was him. Kudos to the driver for being honest, though in this case it did him no good in terms of his driving record. Schwab arrests the man and hauls him off to jail. Had the driver simply refused to answer questions it’s possible that the officers would’ve been left without the evidence needed to make a case that this was indeed the driver of the speeding car.  Image Credit: LRHN",
