But it has suffered by comparison: adding power and straight-line speed is easy on EVs and doesn’t make for an everyday performance hero. Now, with new management in Wolfsburg committed to GTI, it’s GTX that’s being phased out. Some irony, then, that the Volkswagen ID 7 GTX showcases exactly what the badge could stand for: a compelling take on what a warmed-up VW EV can be, with a distinct nod towards grand tourers and a different feel to GTI cars. It helps that this new model has an excellent base to work from: in entry-level Pro form, the Vokswagen ID 7 was named Autocar's Best Saloon of 2024 and the best in a competitive class that also includes the Tesla Model 3. It's a refined, understated and well-rounded car, a better base to create a GTX model from than the earlier ID 4 and ID 5 SUVs. So is the ID 7 GTX a true electric performance car or, as is often the car with hot EVs, would you be better off sticking to the base model? GoodEffortless performanceStrong driving dynamics, even if it's no pure driver's carSubtle but notable GTX styling cuesBadIt's not a true driver's car in the spirit of the GTI brandExtra performance means range takes a hitQuite a price rise from lower versions of the ID 7 DESIGN \u0026 STYLING8 Pros Dual motor set-up adds plenty of performance GTX styling elements are subtle but notableModifications for GTX model extend beyond adding power Cons Extra motor does come at the expense of rangeGTX upgrades are subtle, so this isn't a full-on performance car The ID 7 GTX features a four-wheel-drive powertrain. At the rear is the same 282bhp Volkswagen Group APP550 permanent magnet synchronous electric motor as in the standard Pro and Pro S versions. That's twinned with a new 107bhp asynchronous motor (designated AKA150) mounted on the front axle. The rear motor is the primary drive unit, with the front one called upon when needed. If you were wondering, Volkswagen chose to use an asynchronous unit on the front axle because it claims this is more efficient when not being called upon to provide power.Despite the two motors offering 282bhp and 107bhp respectively, total system output is capped at 335bhp. That's 53bhp more than the standard version of the ID 7 but significantly down on the 460bhp Tesla Model 3 Performance.Crucially, the modifications made for this GTX model extend beyond simply adding more power than you could sensibly enjoy. The progressive steering has been tuned to offer more feel, with the electronic differential lock system also reworked. There has also been extensive work to broaden the variance in dynamics enabled by the Dynamic Chassis Control (fitted as standard in the UK). Notably, Volkswagen engineers say the big advances have come from developments of the system software.The other big technical change is in the battery: the 77kWh pack used in the Pro model has been switched for an 86kWh one (also found in the long-range Pro S). It's a different design, with the pack containing 13 cell modules instead of 12. It means that in saloon form, the GTX offers a range of 364 miles. The exterior styling changes that mark out the GTX from standard versions of the ID 7 are subtle but notable.There's a new front bumper design exclusive to the performance line, along with revamped daytime running lights and a gloss-black front air intake. The bumper is aerodynamically styled to aid efficiency, while the front-end design now features a light-up VW logo as standard. At the rear, there's a bespoke horizontal light strip (the rear VW badge illuminates as well) and customisable 3D-effect LED clusters.On the saloon version, the lower area of the rear bumper features a honeycomb grille pattern and there's a notable diffuser. The GTX sits on 20in wheels as standard, with 21in versions available as an option. There are also custom GTX wheel rim designs.The GTX is also offered in Tourer estate form, which has an identical footprint and wheelbase to the saloon version but a bulkier rear end to accommodate a usefully larger boot.The two machines are visually identical at the front and share identical mechanicals, but because of the greater surface area, the Tourer has a reduced – but still substantial – range of 357 miles. Pros Maintains all the strengths of the regular ID 7Excellent low-slung saloon driving position Cons GTX styling elements are somewhat subtleAlmost every control is touchscreen-based The interior of the ID 7 GTX will be familiar to anyone who has sat in a regular ID 7. Although since this is a performance version, there are, of course, a range of styling upgrades designed to convey a dash of dynamism.The custom Ergoactive front seats features a GTX-specific design, featuring a covering of a special microfibre material. There are also red decorative elements and GTX logos etched into the backrests. The steering wheel and other systems also feature red stitching elements.Elsewhere, things are essentially the same as the regular ID 7, so there's a small digital cockpit with many of the displays moved to a large head-up display. Notably, Volkswagen has continued to work on the system, and so it can now display directions from Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.The 15in infotainment touchscreen also remains, and many of the key controls of the car have been shifted to it. But as you can read in our main ID 7 review, everything is well laid-out and relatively easy to use.Essentially, this is a car designed for long-distance driving, and the interior supports that purpose. It feels plush and premium without being overly fussy, and the low-slung driving position is excellent – enough to remind you why there should always be a place for saloons in this age of SUVs.  ENGINES \u0026 PERFORMANCE9 Pros Effortless performance with plenty of powerSmooth and consistent acceleration has a nice linear feel Cons Some rivals offer more power and better acceleration (not that you need it)Lack of bite from the brake pedal dents your confidence Under heavy acceleration, the GTX feels as quick as its claimed 0-62mph time of 5.4sec suggests – and unlike in many hot electric saloons or estates, enjoyment doesn’t come only in a straight line.While it wants for power compared to rivals such as the Model 3 Performance, you would be very unlikely to notice unless you actually took them to a track for a drag race. In the real world, there's more than enough pace.It's very usable, too. You get a big whack of power when you step on the accelerator, but it never feels uneven, and even under heavy loads the power is well-modulated. And if you need extra power while at speed, the ID 7 GTX will never be lacking for response.Because the car favours its rear wheels, it maintains a touch of rear-drive bias. This means you can have some fun on a British country road, with it feeling responsive.Mind you, much of the above can also apply to the single-motor Pro and Pro S models, and while they don't offer the same level of ultimate performance, you would be hard-pressed to really exploit the difference in everyday driving.Our one big criticism with regards to driving the GTX quickly is the feel of the brake pedal, or rather the lack thereof. Incredibly light, it brought to mind old cars whose brakes had faded, denting my confidence to push on. RIDE \u0026 HANDLING8 Pros Notably refined ride, especially given the car's heavy weightOffers more driver engagement than many electric saloonsRetuned DCC system offers increased range between driving modes Cons It's not a huge step up from standard ID 7 models The steering of the GTX doesn’t offer hot hatch levels of engagement, but it’s direct and responsive. To Volkswagen's credit, it isn't hammed up with extra weight or springiness to give a false impression of sportiness – a trap that makers of many warmed-up models have fallen into.The car maintains its composure along fast, flowing roads, even when riding on big 21in wheels. It has an agility that belies its considerable 2328kg weight (which, by way of comparison it, makes it just 58kg lighter than the latest Volkswagen California camper van).The Dynamic Chassis Control (DCC) system has been tuned to offer a wider margin between the various driving modes, yet even in Sport the GTX has strong ride quality and maintains its composure well.The dynamic management system works away in the background, calculating things like how much power to draw from each motor. It can also take more regen from the front motor in order to help the car turn in.While the GTX offers a level of engagement that many hot EVs lack, it’s not an outright driver’s car. It’s an engaging GT that has plenty of appeal in the form of an executive saloon. Again, a caveat would be that more standard ID 7 models run it closer. The GTX feels marginally sharper and more responsive, but it's not like the Pro and Pro S are dynamic slouches.Instead of feeling like a true performance variant, such as the Golf GTI, this ultimately feels like a warmed-up range-topper for the regular ID 7 line-up.  MPG \u0026 RUNNING COSTS7 Pros Ability to charge at speeds of up to 200kW is welcomeMost of the kit you will want is included as standardOfficial range of 364 miles is impressive Cons The ID 7 Pro S offers substantially more rangeThe GTX is quite a price hike from the rest of the ID 7 range The GTX's 86kWh battery gives the saloon an official range of 364 miles and the estate a marginally inferior 357 miles. That's quite impressive in bare statistics, but in single-motor Pro S form, the ID 7 will achieve up to 440 miles.Our experience suggests you should be able to achieve close to 300 miles in the real world – although doing so will obviously require you not exploiting the full potential of the powertrain.The new battery also allows for faster charging, so you can top up the GTX at speeds of up to 200kW.In the UK, the GTX is priced from £59,025, which is a substantial step up from the £51,005 for entry-level Pro and £54,490 for the Pro S, which shares the new 86kWh battery.You can add about £750 to each of those prices if you want an estate body instead of a saloon one.The GTX is at least well equipped for the outlay: standard equipment includes the adaptive chassis control, adaptive cruise control, a Harman Kardon sound system, an auto-dimming rear view mirror, 30-colour ambient lighting and the augmented reality head-up display.An efficiency-boosting heat pump was originally a £1050 option in the UK, but since 2025 one has featured as standard. GoodEffortless performanceStrong driving dynamics, even if it's no pure driver's carSubtle but notable GTX styling cuesBadIt's not a true driver's car in the spirit of the GTI brandExtra performance means range takes a hitQuite a price rise from lower versions of the ID 7 Overall, the GTX is a fast, refined and compelling package – and a far more rounded electric performance car than many of its rivals. It showcases what the GTX badge can be: a family EV with a welcome dash of added performance and dynamism. Volkswagen has taken an already excellent car and added further dashes of power, engagement and comfort. But there is a catch, and it's one that is familiar with performance EVs: if were were looking to buy an ID 7, we would be tempted to shop lower down the line-up. In its single-motor Pro and Pro S forms, the ID 7 is still enjoyable to drive, plenty fast enough for the real world and up to £10,000 cheaper. While the GTX makes a reasonable case for itself, the Pro S is almost as well equipped and offers 65 miles of extra range. That said, if you like the idea of a warmed-up electric Volkswagen that can be a practical, long-range family hauler and do a good impression of a super-saloon, there's much to like here.

It feels plush and premium without being overly fussy, and the low-slung driving position is excellent – enough to remind you why there should always be a place for saloons in this age of SUVs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n                                        \n                  \u003c/div\u003e\n  \n\n  \n\u003cdiv data-id=\"performance\" id=\"chapter-performance\"\u003e\n                                      \u003cdiv id=\"price_rating\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eENGINES \u0026amp; PERFORMANCE\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e9\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePros\u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eEffortless performance with plenty of power\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSmooth and consistent acceleration has a nice linear feel\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCons\u003c/span\u003e\n      \u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome rivals offer more power and better acceleration (not that you need it)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLack of bite from the brake pedal dents your confidence\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnder heavy acceleration, the GTX feels as quick as its claimed 0-62mph time of 5.4sec suggests – and unlike in many hot electric saloons or estates, enjoyment doesn’t come only in a straight line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile it wants for power compared to rivals such as the Model 3 Performance, you would be very unlikely to notice unless you actually took them to a track for a drag race. In the real world, there\u0026#39;s more than enough pace.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s very usable, too. You get a big whack of power when you step on the accelerator, but it never feels uneven, and even under heavy loads the power is well-modulated. And if you need extra power while at speed, the ID 7 GTX will never be lacking for response.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause the car favours its rear wheels, it maintains a touch of rear-drive bias. This means you can have some fun on a British country road, with it feeling responsive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMind you, much of the above can also apply to the single-motor Pro and Pro S models, and while they don\u0026#39;t offer the same level of ultimate performance, you would be hard-pressed to really exploit the difference in everyday driving.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur one big criticism with regards to driving the GTX quickly is the feel of the brake pedal, or rather the lack thereof. Incredibly light, it brought to mind old cars whose brakes had faded, denting my confidence to push on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n                                                      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n\n        \n\u003cdiv data-id=\"ride\" id=\"chapter-ride\"\u003e\n                                      \u003cdiv id=\"price_rating\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eRIDE \u0026amp; HANDLING\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e8\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePros\u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eNotably refined ride, especially given the car\u0026#39;s heavy weight\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOffers more driver engagement than many electric saloons\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRetuned DCC system offers increased range between driving modes\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCons\u003c/span\u003e\n      \u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s not a huge step up from standard ID 7 models\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe steering of the GTX doesn’t offer hot hatch levels of engagement, but it’s direct and responsive. To Volkswagen\u0026#39;s credit, it isn\u0026#39;t hammed up with extra weight or springiness to give a false impression of sportiness – a trap that makers of many warmed-up models have fallen into.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe car maintains its composure along fast, flowing roads, even when riding on big 21in wheels. It has an agility that belies its considerable 2328kg weight (which, by way of comparison it, makes it just 58kg lighter than the latest Volkswagen California camper van).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Dynamic Chassis Control (DCC) system has been tuned to offer a wider margin between the various driving modes, yet even in Sport the GTX has strong ride quality and maintains its composure well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe dynamic management system works away in the background, calculating things like how much power to draw from each motor. It can also take more regen from the front motor in order to help the car turn in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the GTX offers a level of engagement that many hot EVs lack, it’s not an outright driver’s car. It’s an engaging GT that has plenty of appeal in the form of an executive saloon. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAgain, a caveat would be that more standard ID 7 models run it closer. The GTX feels marginally sharper and more responsive, but it\u0026#39;s not like the Pro and Pro S are dynamic slouches.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead of feeling like a true performance variant, such as the Golf GTI, this ultimately feels like a warmed-up range-topper for the regular ID 7 line-up. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n                                                      \u003c/div\u003e\n \n\n \n\u003cdiv data-id=\"mpg\" id=\"chapter-mpg\"\u003e\n                                    \u003cdiv id=\"price_rating\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMPG \u0026amp; RUNNING COSTS\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e7\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePros\u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbility to charge at speeds of up to 200kW is welcome\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost of the kit you will want is included as standard\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOfficial range of 364 miles is impressive\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCons\u003c/span\u003e\n      \u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe ID 7 Pro S offers substantially more range\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe GTX is quite a price hike from the rest of the ID 7 range\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe GTX\u0026#39;s 86kWh battery gives the saloon an official range of 364 miles and the estate a marginally inferior 357 miles.
