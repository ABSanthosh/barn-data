  "description": "Kia has begun testing the second-generation Seltos internationally. The Seltos has been around since 2019, and its next-gen model will debut sometime next year. New Seltos could be similar in dimensions to the current one Will likely get an all-new design language, with heavily revised front and rear   Multiple powertrains expected; petrol-hybrid may come later Next-gen Kia Seltos: what do the spy shots reveal? The spy shots of the next-gen Seltos reveal that the overall size and silhouette remain similar to the current model, save for the front and rear styling, which seem to have undergone major changes. While the prototype is heavily covered, one can make out redesigned front and rear fascia with new headlamps and tail-lamps. While the rear styling seems very similar to the Kia EV5 SUV, the front styling appears quite unique and unlike any Kia model in the market. The heavily covered nose seems rather upright and shows two squarish headlamp units with LED daytime running lamps on the outline. The front grille appears to be rectangular with vertical slats. While these design cues may not be final, they point at a new design direction for the Seltos. Next-gen Kia Seltos: powertrain details Not much is known about the powertrain, but we expect Kia to offer multiple fuel options, starting with a turbo petrol and a turbo diesel and introducing a petrol-hybrid version at some point. Kia has earlier hinted that it is evaluating petrol-hybrid powertrains for its models in India.   Next-gen Kia Seltos: India launch timeline Sources tell us that the all-new Seltos’ could debut globally sometime in the second quarter of 2025. We expect the all-new Creta rival to come to India sometime in late next year or early 2026. Before the all-new Seltos, Kia will introduce as many as three models in India next year, the first being an all-new compact SUV (codenamed AY), followed by the Carens facelift and the Carens EV by mid-2025.
