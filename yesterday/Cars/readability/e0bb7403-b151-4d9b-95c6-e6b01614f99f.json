  "text": "Jetta sales jumped over 50% thanks to an eye-catching facelift January 3, 2025 at 19:02 by Michael Gauthier Volkswagen dealers are finally getting parts to fix the ID.4 and resume sales. ID.4 production is slated to restart in the coming weeks and the automaker is promising lease deals. Volkswagen sales jumped 15.2% last year, thanks in part to strong demand for the Atlas and Jetta. Door handle problems have plagued the Volkswagen ID.4, sparking recalls, a production halt, and a stop sale order. This has had a devastating impact on the company’s bottom line as sales plunged 93.9% in the fourth quarter and dropped 55% for the year. Those are brutal statistics, but there’s light at the end of the tunnel. Earlier today, Volkswagen announced the availability of replacement door handles that will not only enable dealers to repair customer vehicles, but also fix models that have been sitting in inventory unable to be sold. More: VW Stops ID.4 Production Because It Can’t Fix Leaky Door Handles This means the stop sale order is being lifted and the company is gearing up to introduce some “highly competitive lease offers” to celebrate the relaunch. Furthermore, Volkswagen is set to resume production in Chattanooga, Tennessee in the coming weeks. Getting back to sales, Volkswagen of America sold 379,178 vehicles last year for a 15.2% increase. The brand’s best-selling model was the Atlas, which was up 24.1% to 75,516 units. The facelifted Jetta is also a hit as sales were up 51.5%. In fact, every single model saw sales increase besides the ID.4. As for the Arteon, it was axed for the 2024 model year and dealers are simply clearing out existing inventory. It’s mostly gone at this point, but a quick search shows around 20 new units in stock, some with discounts of approximately $10,000. The brand’s latest model, the ID. Buzz, appears to be off to a modest start as dealers only moved 1,162 units in the fourth quarter. However, it’s important to note deliveries didn’t begin until late in the quarter and the model has been subject to hefty markups. 2024 VW U.S. Sales",
