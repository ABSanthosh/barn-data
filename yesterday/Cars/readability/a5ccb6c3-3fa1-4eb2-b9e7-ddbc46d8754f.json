But, like countless commuter bikes, it’s built for getting you to work and back—not for customization. It takes vision to look past the Twister’s funky bodywork to see something classier lurking within. If you’ve never heard of the Honda CBX250 Twister, don’t fret. It was sold as the CBF250 in Europe, and never made it to the States. But in countries like Argentina, it was (and still is) a hit. This peppy 2005-model Honda CBX250 Twister comes from Karma Motocicletas in Rosario—a city in central Argentina that lies on the west bank of the Paraná River. Mauricio Martínez runs Karma as a one-man band and does everything in-house, short of specialist tasks like upholstery and coatings. Mauricio’s inspiration came from Japan’s enduring custom scene—specifically the style established by legends like Go Takamine. “The idea was to keep the bike simple, including only the essential components for its functionality,” he explains. Mauricio stripped the bike down to its frame and began fine-tuning the chassis to create the perfect silhouette. Tweaking the front end involved simply shortening the OEM forks—but the rear needed a heavier hand. Mauricio deleted the Twister’s original mono-shock system, and then added new shock mounts to the swingarm to create a traditional twin-shock arrangement. Aftermarket shocks link the swingarm to new upper mounts on the Twister’s bespoke subframe. Featuring a subtle kick in the tail and tabs to mount everything from the rear fender to the seat, the tidy subframe does a lot to finesse the Twister’s lines. Finer details include a set of handmade (and removable) passenger peg brackets, and one-off foot control mounts that push the pegs forward a little. Next, Mauricio ditched the Twister’s wheels for the Morris-like hoops from a Kawasaki KZ440. They’re wrapped in Metzeler (front) and Coker (back) tires. As for the brakes, those are stock; “I think that’s one of the few things I kept,” Mauricio quips. The tank is another vintage item. It originally came from a Suzuki GN125, but Mauricio managed to massage it to fit the Honda’s frame. A skinny tuck-and-roll seat sits behind it, followed by an abbreviated rear fender. The high-riding handlebars are Mauricio’s handiwork too, as are the minimalistic switches that are integrated into the brake and clutch lever perches. The wiring runs inside the bars, while a handmade battery box under the seat plays host to the bike’s simplified electronics and ignition barrel. Biltwell grips finish off the controls, with a single mirror mounted on the left-hand side. The Twister’s livery is as refreshingly straightforward; a playful turquoise design with stylish gold striping. Mauricio blasted the engine and cleaned up the forks, but had the rest of the hard parts finished in black—including the bike’s custom-built exhaust. Unpretentious and perfectly balanced, Karma’s brat-style Honda CBX250 Twister makes a strong case for the untapped potential of humble commuter bikes. After all, who doesn’t like to show up to work in style? Karma Motocicletas Instagram | Images by Matilde Pizzorno",
