  "text": "Jun 16, 2025 9:00 PM EDTU.S. States with the highest need for speed A new study has revealed an updated list of U.S. states with the fastest and slowest drivers for long trips and urban travel. Wyoming took the crown as the U.S. state with the fastest drivers at an average speed of 71.8 mph during extended trips, according to MoneySuperMarket’s analysis. The maximum speed in Wyoming is 80 mph, and its long, open roads combined with a lower-density population can result in faster driving. New Mexico and Idaho drivers weren’t far behind Wyoming at average speeds of 71 and 70 mph, respectively. Georgia took fourth place at 69.9 mph, while Florida rounded out the top five states at 69.4 mph. Some may have pictured California making its way into this study’s top five spots, considering it has the most drivers of any U.S. state, but its average speed was toward the middle at 58.4 mph. States with the highest average urban driving speeds were Alaska at 30.3 mph, Alabama at 30.1 mph, and Nebraska at 29.7 mph. Arkansas and Missouri followed at 28 mph and 27.8 mph. Easy does it if you’re in the following states On the opposite end of the spectrum, New Hampshire clocked the lowest average pace of 49.9 mph, while Vermont and Maryland followed at 52.8 mph and 54.7 mph. Rhode Island logged the fourth-lowest average speed of 56.4 mph, with Alaska just behind at 56.5 mph. Regarding low urban driving speeds, Massachusetts ranked number one at 19.6 mph, Maryland ranked second at 20.6 mph, and Michigan ranked third at 20.9 mph. Colorado and Ohio locals drove the fourth and fifth-slowest in urban areas, with average speeds of 21.2 mph and 21.4 mph.  Based on the average driving paces of the three most populated cities in each country, the U.S. took first place at 68.1 mph over long distances. Canada registered second place at 67.1 mph, with Oman in third at 65.1 mph. Germany is known for its autobahn highway system, most of which doesn’t have a speed limit, but the country was reported as the 16th-fastest at 58.3 mph. Malta and Mauritania were the two slowest-driving countries, with average speeds of just over 14 mph. Final thoughts  Wyoming is suited for faster-paced driving with geographical elements like extended, undeveloped stretches on Interstate 25 and Interstate 80, as well as an 80 mph top speed limit. Texas is the only state with a faster speed limit of 85 mph. While some U.S. drivers may avoid speeding to save money on gas, Wyoming has some of the highest elevations of any state, with its thin air benefiting fuel economy. Additionally, Wyoming street racers don’t face strict penalties, with fines starting at $10 and capping at $100. Regarding some of the slower-driving states, speed cameras may be a factor. Maryland, which has some of the slowest drivers in the country, both in urban areas and on long trips, has a plethora of speed cameras, especially in places like Montgomery County in the Washington D.C. metro area. Washington D.C. has the highest density of speed cameras in the U.S. About the AuthorCody Carlson",
