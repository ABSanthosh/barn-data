  "text": "The Skyline 2000GT is fitted with a 3.5-liter inline-six equipped with Jenvey throttle bodies and a 350Z manual gearbox January 18, 2025 at 19:08 by Chris Chilton A stunning modified 1975 Nissan Skyline 2000GT is up for sale. The JDM coupe has GTR styling parts and a 400 hp inline six. Chassis mods include front coilovers and fat Watanabe wheels. We love a modified classic Porsche 911 as much as the next car nut, but when you’ve seen so many it’s hard not to find yourself yearning for something different – something like this incredible Kenmeri Skyline. Based on the Skyline coupe produced between 1972 and 1977, it looks at a quick glance like the hyper-rare second-generation Skyline GT-R, of which only 197 were built in 1973. It’s not a GT-R though. Actually, it started life as a less exotic 2000GT, which came with a 128 hp (130 PS) single-cam six rather than the hero car’s 158 hp (160 PS) DOHC motor. But it now has the kind of spec that would annihilate a true GT-R. Related: Nissan’s R32 EV Is The Coolest Form Of GT-R Blasphemy The transformation is the work of Utah-based JDM Legends, who sourced the GT from Japan and shipped it back to the US for modification. Already repainted white by a previous owner in Japan, and fitted with front and rear spoilers, arch extensions, a black tail panel and GT-R grilles and badges, the Skyline’s story stepped up a gear once it was back in JDM Legends’ garage. A stroker-crank 3.5-liter Nissan L-Series engine that uses a Maxima diesel block due its taller deck height now sits between the shock towers, and with the help of individual Jenvey throttle bodies and a bespoke ECU punches out around 400 hp (406 PS). That power is sent to the R180 LSD at the rear through a Jim Wolf racing clutch assembly, a Nissan 350Z six-speed manual transmission and a Driveshaft Shop aluminium driveshaft. Classic 15-inch RS Watanabe wheels bulge from each corner and are connected to an adjustable coilover suspension and MK63 Skyline brake calipers up front, and some deliciously retro finned aluminum brake drums from a 240Z at the rear. The carpet-free interior must be nosiy as hell, but with those throttle bodies sucking, it’s be a noise worth hearing, and the fixed-back, vented Datsun Competition seats and carbon-fiber reinforced (CFRP) door panels bring old and new motorsport technologies together harmoniously. JDM Legends suggests a curb weight of around 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg), which makes this modded GT around 1,000 lbs (450 kg) lighter than a modern Nissan Z that makes the same 400 hp. It’ll sell for far above Z money, though, the final price likely to end up in 911 restomod territory. But which would you take? You can check out the Bring a Trailer listing here.",
