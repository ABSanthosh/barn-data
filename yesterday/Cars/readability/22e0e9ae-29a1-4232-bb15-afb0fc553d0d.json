  "text": "This 1976 Porsche 930 Turbo is a European-market example that is said to have spent time in the Netherlands before arriving in Belgium circa 2000, and a refurbishment carried out within the last year involved re-dying the Hell Green leather upholstery, applying replacement gold “Turbo” graphics, and overhauling the turbocharged 3.0-liter flat-six and the four-speed manual transaxle. The car was repainted in Black under previous ownership, and it also features a “whale tail” rear spoiler, European-specification exterior components, 15″ Fuchs alloy wheels, and a Blaupunkt cassette stereo. This 930 Turbo is offered by the selling dealer, a BaT Local Partner, on dealer consignment with a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, a seller-prepared refurbishment summary, service records, and Belgian registration. The car was specified from the factory in Black Metallic (701), and the selling dealer notes that the car was repainted in Black (A1) under previous ownership. Replacement gold graphics with “Turbo” script were applied as part of the refurbishment, and additional exterior details include a front spoiler, fog lights, and dual mirrors along with European-specification H4 headlights, taillight lenses, and rear bumperettes. Scratches are visible on the “whale tail” rear spoiler, the decals are not fully adhered, and poor paint quality is noted on various panels. The selling dealer reports that although body filler is present beneath the finish on the right-rear wheel arch, they have not found signs of past major accidents. Staggered-width 15″ Fuchs alloy wheels are mounted with are mounted with a mixed set of 205/60 Continental ContiPremiumContact 5 front tires and 225/60 Continental ContiPremiumContact 2 rear tires. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes with ventilated rotors. The car was ordered with Hell Green (2AP) leather covering the front bucket seats and the rear seats, which are accompanied by a color-coordinated dashboard and door panels. A cabin refurbishment performed within the last year involved re-dying the seats, and interior features include power windows, a heater, and a Blaupunkt cassette stereo. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a central tachometer with an inset turbocharger boost gauge as well as a 300-km/h speedometer, an analog clock, and gauges for oil level, oil temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 81k kilometers (~50k miles), approximately 2k kilometers (~1,200 miles) of which were added under current ownership. The seller states the mileage is not accurate, and total mileage is unknown. The turbocharged 3.0-liter flat-six was factory rated at 260 horsepower and 253 lb-ft of torque. The engine was overhauled as part of the refurbishment, which also involved servicing the electrical system. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle, which was overhauled as part of the refurbishment. A refurbishment summary document provided by the seller lists services totaling over €31k. Detailed invoices are presented in the gallery below. The Porsche Certificate of Authenticity shows a build date of February 17, 1976, and lists factory colors and equipment along with identification numbers. The vehicle is being sold on its Belgian registration, which serves as an ownership document in Belgium. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
