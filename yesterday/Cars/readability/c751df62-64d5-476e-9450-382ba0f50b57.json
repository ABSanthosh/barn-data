  "description": "In its second round of teaser campaigns leading up to the Independence Day event, Mahindra has now given us a new look at the upcoming Vision X concept. Four new Mahindra concept SUVs, along with a new platform vision, will be showcased on August 15, and this one is expected to add to the XUV family. Mahindra Vision X has headlamps mounted on the bumper Could be a traditional SUV alternative to the XEV 9e coupe-SUV Mahindra Vision X new design details The previous Mahindra Vision X teaser gave us a top-angle view of the bonnet, showing some very stylish and athletic lines on it. This one shows us a side-profile view, hinting at a layered design for the fascia, with the headlamps mounted on the bumper. The Vision X also gets wheel-arch cladding and what looks like aero-optimised alloy wheels. We expect this concept to preview a new model in the XUV family. In fact, this could be the long-awaited XEV 7e, which will be a more traditional SUV alternative to the XEV 9e coupe-SUV. The XEV 7e has even been spied on testing on several occasions, with the top hat of an XUV700 and EV-specific updates and interior bits from the XEV 9e. The Vision X certainly seems to have a premium and urban positioning as opposed to the more rugged appeal of the Vision S and Vision SXT that have come before. Not many details are available about the Vision X at the moment. We’ll know more about the SUV once it debuts on August 15 alongside three other concepts. Stay tuned.
