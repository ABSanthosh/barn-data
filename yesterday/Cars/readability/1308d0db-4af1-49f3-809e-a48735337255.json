  "description": "Lighter, faster, and meaner – the Maserati GT2 Stradale is the MC20 at its most unhinged. This isn’t just a track-focused special; it’s a full-throttle, no-compromise statement from Maserati. Developed from the GT2 race car but adapted for road use, the Stradale is sharper, more powerful and even more thrilling to drive. The pit lane at Yas Marina hums with quiet anticipation. Parked in front of me, the Maserati GT2 Stradale squats low and wide, every bit the hardcore track weapon it promises to be. Stripped of excess weight and dialled up on downforce with underbody diffusers and a massive rear wing, the GT2 Stradale is primed for battle. So am I. Maserati GT2 Stradale exterior design Optimised for weight saving and downforce One look at the GT2 Stradale, and its intentions are clear. The towering adjustable rear wing alone generates up to 500kg of downforce at speed, keeping the car pinned to the tarmac. Up front, larger air intakes and a reworked splitter ensure maximum cooling and stability. Carbon fibre isn’t just for show – it’s used extensively for weight savings and structural rigidity. Rear wing produces 500kg of downforce.   Maserati GT2 Stradale performance and handling Drop into the tight bucket seat, strap yourself in, and hit the starter button. The Nettuno V6 ignites with a bark – raw, visceral and unfiltered, in a way the standard MC20 never quite was. This is the GT2 Stradale’s truest form, road-legal in the most technical sense but spiritually bound to the circuit. Powered by 640hp, 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 engine At its core sits Maserati’s spectacular 3.0-litre twin-turbo Nettuno V6, now massaged to 640hp – up from the MC20’s 621hp. And it’s lighter, too. The GT2 Stradale was put on a diet, shedding 59kg to tip the scales at just 1,365kg. The result? A blistering 0-100kph time of 2.8 seconds and a top speed of 324kph. Neatly styled air intakes to cool the Nettuno V6 engine.   Razor-sharp responses and gear shifts Out of the pit lane, I squeeze the throttle, and it’s immediately obvious how hyper-reactive this track-focused Maserati is. Every input is met with an immediate and razor-sharp response, and the 8-speed dual-clutch gearbox rifles through ratios with millisecond precision. Every shift feels instantaneous, and every prod of the throttle pedal is met with a precisely metered surge of power. Braking into Turn 5, the carbon ceramics clamp down with brutal efficiency, hauling the car down from triple-digit speeds in an instant. The front end has the sharp bite of a Rottweiler clinging to the tarmac, beautifully complemented by steering that’s loaded with feedback. Maserati’s engineers have widened the track, stiffened the suspension and fine-tuned the aerodynamics for maximum downforce. The result? A car that feels surgically precise yet alive with every twitch of the wheel. Tight and snug bucket seats are essential for coping with high g-forces. On slower corners, you can provoke the rear into a controlled slide, but it never feels nervous. It’s playful yet poised, letting you dance at the limit without ever making you feel like you’re about to overstep. Nettuno V6 has a raw, mechanical sound Maserati has always been about the soundtrack, and while the GT2 Stradale’s V6 lacks the operatic wail of a naturally aspirated V8, it has a raw, mechanical ferocity that suits its persona. Opt for the titanium exhaust (track use only), and it snarls like a proper race car, spitting and crackling on downshifts. Throttle sensitivity is razor-sharp; though, below 3,000rpm, there’s a hint of turbo lag. But once the boost comes in, acceleration is relentless. It’s not the outright fastest in its class – the Ferrari 296 is quicker – but the GT2 Stradale delivers a deeply immersive experience. Every input is met with an immediate and razor-sharp response. Within a lap, I’m comfortable with this car, which eggs you on to push harder and harder. By the time I roll back into the pits, my pulse is racing, my hands tingling. This isn’t just another track-focused supercar. This is Maserati rediscovering its soul. Some bits of practicality Despite its hardcore underpinnings, the GT2 Stradale hasn’t completely abandoned road manners. A nose-lift system raises the front by 1.4 inches – critical for avoiding the heartbreak of scraping that carbon splitter. There’s even a 100-litre boot, but let’s be honest, practicality isn’t why you buy this car. Maserati GT2 Stradale interior Every detail focused for driving Inside, it’s all business. Alcantara dominates the dashboard to minimise glare, while the carbon-fibre bucket seats are available in two sizes. They grip you tight – brilliant for the track but a reminder that this isn’t a car for long-haul comfort. Shift lights on the steering wheel, a relocated drive-mode selector – every detail is designed for pure driving focus. No skimping in the cockpit, which is covered in Alcantara. Where the GT2 Stradale stands apart is in the design. Maserati has always had a way of making even its most extreme cars look effortlessly elegant. Unlike Ferrari’s aggressive, function-first approach to aero, the Stradale retains a sense of Italian artistry. Maserati GT2 Stradale verdict Not an everyday supercar Scissor doors are an integral part of the GT2 Stradale’s visual drama. The GT2 Stradale is an exquisite blend of race-car aggression and road-going grace. It’s not an everyday supercar – far from it – but for those lucky enough to get behind the wheel, it delivers a raw, unfiltered driving experience few cars can match. Production is limited to 914 units, a nod to Maserati’s founding year, 1914. Pricing remains under wraps, but with this level of exclusivity and performance, expect it to command a hefty premium over the MC20. For the driving purist, this is as close to a road-legal race car as Maserati has ever built. And it’s utterly magnificent.   Also See: Aston Martin Vantage India review: split personality New BMW M5 track drive: Heavyweight champ",
