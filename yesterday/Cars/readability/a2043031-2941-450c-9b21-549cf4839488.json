Having 3,700 miles, it is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.8L flat-six that drives all four wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle. Equipment includes the Sport Chrono Package, a sunroof, 20″ Sport Classic alloy wheels, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, an electronic limited-slip rear differential, LED headlights, ParkAssist, a Burmester sound system, and automatic climate control. This 991.1 is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner in California with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New York title in the name of the owner’s LLC. The car is finished in paint-to-sample Graphite Gray and has LED headlights with the Porsche Dynamic Light System Plus as well as front and rear ParkAssist, a power sunroof, quarter panel air intakes, a speed-activated rear spoiler, 50th Anniversary Edition badging, clear taillights, and quad exhaust outlets. Replacement hood and engine cover supports were fitted in 2023. The 20″ Sport Classic alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport 4s tires. Braking is handled by Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) featuring yellow-painted Porsche-branded calipers at all four corners. Rear-axle steering and Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC) were standard equipment on the Turbo S, and the car is equipped with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM). The heated adaptive Sport Plus front seats are trimmed in black leather with Houndstooth-style inserts, “911 50” embroidery on the headrests, and contrasting stitching that extends to the dashboard, center armrest, steering column, air vent surrounds, rear side panels, and door panels. Personalized Porsche-branded floor mats line the footwells, and additional appointments include aluminum pedals, the Light Design Package, Porsche Communication Management with navigation, leather-wrapped air vents, a Burmester sound system, cruise control, and dual-zone automatic climate control. The trim on the dashboard carries “50 Jahre 911” script along with Jerry Seinfeld’s initials. The three-spoke SportDesign steering wheel frames a central tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline as well as a 225-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 3,700 miles, all of which were added under current ownership. The twin-turbocharged 3.8L flat-six features aluminum construction and direct fuel injection. Factory-rated output was 560 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, and the Sport Chrono Package adds an over-boost function that temporarily raises peak torque to 553 lb-ft. An oil change was performed in January 2024. The underside of the front trunk lid carries a signature by automobile designer Tony Hatter, the former Porsche Head of Design who was responsible for designing cars such as the 993, 993 Turbo, GT1, 996 GT3, 996 GT2, 997 GT2, and the production model Carrera GT. Power is sent to all four wheels via a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle and an electronically locking rear differential with Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus. Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery. The window sticker lists initial delivery to New Country Porsche of Greenwich in Connecticut, along with factory equipment, colors, options, and a total price of $240,150.
