  "description": "As with the older Tour-X4, Arai’s latest Adventure helmet is very versatile, in that it can also be configured as a road helmet without the peak or an MX-style helmet without the visor. However, it now addresses a universal complaint with the previous Tour-X4 – its visor change mechanism that needed the removal of four screws. The new one debuts a much easier system where the entire peak and visor can be removed by using just a small push tab under the covering plate. In typical Arai fashion, it’s a marvelously over-engineered solution that can be intimidating to use at first, but you quickly figure it out, and the system works well. Just ensure that the mechanism is properly clicked into place before you ride off!   The X5 gets a new Pinlock-compatible visor that has a more rounded profile with improved optics. One of the big changes here is the removal of the trademark eyebrow vents in the visor, which is a bit bittersweet. On the one hand, those vents definitely work well, but the flip side is that they tend to leak in continuous heavy rain, even when closed. The Tour-X5 also drops the chin vents on the sides of the helmet jaw. The total number of vents has reduced, but the actual venting is still superb, so I have no complaints.      I spent a week in this helmet at the GS Trophy, which was easily the most intense riding of my life, and the comfort was excellent. The best helmets are the ones that melt away into the background and let you focus on your riding, and this one manages just that.  The Tour-X5’s peak has also been redesigned, and I found that it had noticeably less lift at high speeds on an adventure bike. It also feels much better on naked bikes, with negligible lift at a steady 100kph. However, the tradeoff is that wind noise is quite high, so it’s best to use this helmet on a bike with good wind protection.    The Tour-X5 has a weight similar to the Tour-X4   Weighing 1,650 grams, it is more or less the same as the T4, but like the old helmet, it feels superbly balanced and great for all-day usage. Another really appreciable change is that Arai knows almost all its customers will install a Bluetooth communicator, so they’ve made it easier to do so. The cheek pads now have dedicated circular Velcro extensions for your speakers, and there are even small wire-managing tabs built into the liner. This is definitely the nicest helmet I’ve used for installing/removing a comms device, and it’ll be great to see other Arai models get a similar treatment.    It has convenient cut-outs for speakers   The helmet is now ECE 22-06-compliant, and quality is at a typically high level with a beautiful paint finish, the most luxurious inner liner material you’ll ever come across and a solid, built-to-last feel in every component. As always, this helmet is an investment in a top-quality handmade product, and the prices match that. They currently start at a little under Rs 60,000 for plain colours in Europe and go up for graphics. You will save a significant amount if you shop from some Asian markets, but be aware that Arai’s shell shapes and sizes are different in these markets, so it’s crucial to try before you buy.    Where: araihelmet.eu   Price: Rs 64,000 (approx.)   Also see: Arai Tour-X4 helmet review",
