  "text": "The rebar was sticking out from the rear passenger window and struck a Ford, a Chevy, and a BMW May 4, 2025 at 21:10 by Brad Anderson Cadillac driver in Texas caught on video with metal rebar sticking out the window. Rebar strikes side mirrors of Ford F-Series and Chevrolet van, causing plastic to fly. The sun’s glare could have blinded drivers, making them unaware of the danger. Ridiculous things happen on the road all the time, but the driver of this Cadillac might just take the crown for one of the most bizarrely reckless moves we’ve seen in years. A short clip recently surfaced on Reddit, and while the driver likely thought they were just out for a casual drive, the internet has wasted no time in tossing a well-deserved pile of insults their way. The video, filmed somewhere in Texas, shows a Cadillac cruising down a two-lane road. At first glance, everything seems perfectly normal, even mundane. But then you notice something that looks like it’s straight out of a “what not to do” handbook: two pieces of steel rebar sticking out of the rear window. Read: This Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing 120th Ann. Lost Nearly $50K After Just 3,600 Miles As the driver of the Cadillac cruises towards a bridge underpass, the two pieces of rebar slam into the wing mirror of a Ford F-Series traveling in the opposite direction. Pieces of plastic can be seen flying through the air. Moments later, the rebar strikes the wing mirror of a white Chevrolet van, breaking it as well. While the rebar is easily visible from behind the Cadillac, it doesn’t appear as though the drivers traveling in the opposite direction could spot it. This could be because they were driving directly into the setting sun as the driver of the Ford had the sun visor down, while the driver of the Chevy can be seen using their hand to shield their eyes. After hitting the Chevy, a Ford Mustang appears to come within inches of hitting the rebar. The Ford driver appears to have noticed at the very last second and can be seen instinctively moving his head to the right to avoid getting struck. And just to keep things interesting, the Cadillac driver almost plows into some roadworks in the center of the lane, showing exactly how much attention they were paying to the road. Meanwhile, a black BMW 5-Series also seems to have caught a stray hit from the rebar. Through it all, the Cadillac’s license plate is clearly visible, which means that someone will report this kind of driving and the authorities will be paying a little visit to the “creative” road warrior. Let’s hope this is the last time we see rebar playing peekaboo out of a car window.",
