  "description": "This 1929 Ford Model A is a steel-bodied, five-window coupe that was acquired by the previous owner as an unmodified example and subsequently turned into a hot rod during a multi-year refurbishment that was completed in 2012. Power comes from a 239ci 8BA flathead V8 that has been fitted with Offenhauser heads, dual Stromberg 97 carburetors, an Offenhauser intake manifold, a Mallory dual-point distributor, and Red’s Headers. The steel body features a 3½” roof chop and a ’32-style grille shell and is mounted on a boxed and Z’d frame that is fitted with a ’32-style K-member, an F1 steering box, a drop front axle, hydraulic drum brakes, 16″ steel wheels, and “big and little” Firestone tires. Additional details include a Mercury three-speed manual transmission, a ’48 Ford rear end, and a torque tube and axles from a Lincoln. The car has won various awards, including a Rodders Rep Pick at the Goodguys 2012 Fall Del Mar Nationals, and was a Club Pick at the 2013 Grand National Roadster Show. Additionally, the car was featured in the GoodGuys Gazette in July 2013, the French publication American Muscle Car Magazine in December 2013, and Street Rodder Magazine in April 2014. This Ford hot rod was acquired by the seller in 2017 and previously offered on BaT in April 2024, and it is now offered again at no reserve with a California title in the seller’s name.",

This Ford hot rod was acquired by the seller in 2017 and previously offered on BaT in April 2024, and it is now offered again at no reserve with a California title in the seller’s name. The steel coupe body was removed from the frame and received a 3½” top chop, replacement wood framing, and a repaint in Washington Blue before being mounted to a boxed and Z’d frame, which has been fitted with a ’32-style K-member. Exterior details include a ’32-style grille shell, a windshield visor over the tilt-out windshield, a black vinyl roof, a rear rumble seat, an “ahooga” horn, and blue-dot teardrop taillights. Staggered-width 16″ steel wheels wear chrome trim rings and hubcaps and are mounted with “big and little” 5.50 front and 7.50 rear Firestone Deluxe Champion bias ply tires. The car rides on transverse leaf springs front and rear along with a drop front axle and an F1-sourced steering box. Stopping power is provided by hydraulically actuated drum brakes all around. The interior is trimmed in Oxblood vinyl upholstery with black cut-pile carpeting and a slatted oak headliner. Interior elements include an AM tube radio, a glove compartment, a spoon-style accelerator pedal, and a wooden gasoline measuring stick housed in the right kick panel. The two-spoke steering wheel was sourced from a 1940 Ford and fronts a ’36-style dashboard that houses a 100-mph speedometer, a fuel level readout, and a combination gauge. Stewart-Warner gauges for coolant temperature, battery voltage, and oil pressure are located below the dashboard. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 31k miles, though true mileage is unknown. The 239ci Ford 8BA flathead V8 was overhauled by H\u0026H Flatheads in La Crescenta, California, per the seller, and is equipped with Offenhauser heads and dual Stromberg 97 carburetors bolted to an Offenhauser intake manifold and topped with polished air cleaner bonnets as well as an Edmunds fuel block, a Mallory dual-point distributor, and Red’s Headers linked to Smitty’s mufflers. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a three-speed manual transmission sourced from a 1939 Mercury and a 1948 Ford rear end as well as Lincoln-sourced axles and torque tube, which was shortened 12″.
