  "description": "The MG Windsor EV is currently India’s bestselling electric vehicle. Credit to MG, then, that it hasn’t waited for interest to wane before bringing out an upgrade. The Windsor EV Pro you see here gets a larger battery and joins the Windsor line-up as the new range-topper, in both price and actual range.  MG Windsor EV Pro design and engineering - 8/10 Mono-volume MPV-esque silhouette stands out among SUVs The MG Windsor has quickly become a familiar sight across many Indian cities and stands out for its MPV-esque mono-volume silhouette. A healthy 186mm of ground clearance, a relatively wide body and large 18-inch rims also establish it as a fairly substantial vehicle. New alloy wheels are the biggest giveaway of this being the Pro variant. This Pro version is only differentiable by its new diamond-cut alloy wheels and ADAS badging on the tailgate. MG has also used the Pro’s launch to add three new paint shades to the Windsor palette – Celadon Blue, Aurora Silver and Glaze Red, as featured here. MG Windsor EV Pro interior space and comfort - 9/10 Spacious and practical interior, thanks to born-electric architecture  If there’s an area where born-electric vehicles like the MG Windsor have a distinct advantage over combustion-engined models re-engineered as electrics, it is space utilisation. The Windsor EV measures just under 4.3 metres in length, but cabin space is significantly better than most like-sized petrol or diesel SUVs. The rear-seat space is a highlight, with ample legroom even for taller occupants and enough shoulder room for three adults to sit comfortably. A flat floor helps middle-passenger comfort, and then there’s the seat. Well-padded and with the option to recline the backrest to a generous degree, it is good enough to interest buyers looking for a chauffeur-driven vehicle. Rear-seat comfort remains a highlight, with ample space for three abreast.  Giving the Windsor EV Pro’s cabin a slightly different vibe is its dual-tone, ivory-on-black colour theme. For reference, the standard Windsor EV gets an all-black theme. While the lighter upholstery does lend a slightly more premium look to the cabin, it will need more attention and effort to keep clean. Another notable point common to all Windsors is that the front seats aren’t as comfy as the ones at the back and feel firmer in their cushioning. White upholstery looks premium but will need effort to keep clean. In every other way, the Windsor EV Pro is identical to the standard model. A massive 15.6-inch touchscreen dominates the dash, with only a few physical buttons for the climate control and hazard lights tucked away lower down. Supplementing the large screen is a smaller, free-standing digital instrument display. It’s a very modern and airy setting that uses colours and textures (there’s a dull wood finish as well as champagne gold details) to good effect, but user-friendliness is a mixed bag. There’s just too much packed onto the touchscreen, and the need to navigate multiple menus on the go is far from ideal. Practicality is well taken care of with plenty of storage, including a large bay under the floating centre console. Access to the luggage area is via a new powered tailgate, and usable space is impressive. The lack of a spare wheel is a big miss, though.   MG Windsor EV Pro features and safety - 9/10 Equipment list is quite extensive for the money  Large 15.6-inch touchscreen controls most functions, including headlights.  The Windsor EV Pro is only offered in the fully loaded Essence trim and packs in lots for the money. Aside from the touchscreen and digital dials, the list includes LED headlights, a powered driver’s seat, front seat ventilation, a panoramic glass roof, configurable ambient lighting, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a loud Infinity sound system and connected tech. Over the standard Windsor, the Windsor Pro also gets additions, such as a powered tailgate and capabilities including vehicle-to-load (V2L enables you to use your vehicle to power appliances) and vehicle-to-vehicle (with V2V, your vehicle can juice up another EV). New ADAS functions have an inconsistent response.  In terms of safety, the Windsor EV Pro builds on the standard Windsor EV’s six airbags, electronic stability control, electric parking brake and ISOFIX child seat mounts with camera and radar-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The ADAS suite includes intelligent light assist, lane keep assist, emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. Over our test route from Guwahati to Shillong, we found that the ADAS, at times, reacted unnaturally to the driving environment. For instance, on a smooth and clear road, the cruise control would drop speed as if it had detected a vehicle in the vicinity. Lane keep assist was also not consistent in its responses.   A 360-degree camera is included, and it helps in placing the Windsor EV. However, the screen takes quite some time to boot on start-up, so you’ll have to wait patiently if you want a bird’s eye view of your surroundings. Wish MG could have tacked on a rear wiper, which remains a glaring omission on an otherwise feature-loaded car. MG Windsor EV Pro performance and refinement - 8/10 Performance is linear and leisurely  The four drive modes bring about a noticeable difference in power delivery. The EV Pro packs the same 136hp and 200Nm front motor as the standard Windsor EV. Performance is not urgent, but the linear build of power is relaxing. There are four drive modes, and a physical toggle allows easy access. However, we’d recommend you keep to the default Normal setting. Eco and Eco+ feel strangled and should only be used when you are worried about range. Sport mode makes performance sprightlier but also saps charge and range the quickest. While the motor runs quietly, road, wind and suspension noises disturb the calm inside; more on that later. MG Windsor EV Pro ride comfort and handling - 7/10 Hint of firmness at low speeds, vertical movements at higher speeds  The Pro’s larger battery and ADAS addenda have upped the vehicle’s weight by 93kg. At 1.6 tonnes, the Windsor EV Pro is quite heavy for its size, but you won’t feel it as much thanks to the steering that’s light and easy to twirl at low speeds. At higher speeds, too, you get a reasonable sense of connect. However, ride comfort could be better. There’s a firmness that comes through at low speeds, and you can also hear the suspension at work. Up the pace, and there’s also road and wind noise in the cabin. Easy cruises are fine, but wavy surfaces manifest in notable vertical movements. It’s not as settled as, say, a Tata Nexon EV. Ride quality isn't as settled as some of its rivals. Press down on the brake pedal, and you’ll find the Windsor that’s equipped with disc brakes on all four wheels to drop speed with confidence. There’s regen braking, too, with three levels on offer, and you can feel the difference between the levels. However, it lacks the one-pedal drive feature, and there are no physical controls such as paddle shifters to toggle between the regen levels. You have to go into the touchscreen menus, which isn’t ideal. MG Windsor EV Pro range - 8/10 Has an ARAI-claimed range of 449km  The biggest update on the Windsor EV Pro is under the skin. The standard Windsor EV’s 38kWh battery makes way for a 52.9kWh one on the Pro. Consequently, the ARAI-tested range figure jumps to 449km on a single charge from 332km on the standard car. While we will do a full range test when we get the car for a longer duration in Mumbai, it must be mentioned that the standard Windsor’s 308km real-world range achieved over our test loop was very close to the claimed 332km figure. Should the EV Pro deliver the similar efficiency, it’s safe to assume real-world range in the region of 400km-plus. MG Windsor EV Pro price and verdict - 8/10 Remains a very likeable car with the bonus of added range If you were drawn to the MG Windsor EV Pro’s tempting Rs 17.49 lakh launch price, you should know you’ve missed the bus. It was valid only for the first 8,000 buyers. MG has bumped up Windsor EV Pro’s ex-showroom price to Rs 18.1 lakh, which is Rs 2.1 lakh higher than the Windsor with the smaller battery. The added outlay gets you a few more features, but the real hook is the enhanced range. For anyone intending to use their vehicle for intercity commutes, it’s the easy pick of the range. The new Pro variant is the pick of the range for intercity commutes. MG should have worked on the user interface, too, and the ADAS calibration seems rushed, but in other areas, the Windsor EV Pro is very likeable. The roomy cabin makes it a family-friendly choice, performance is pleasant, and you get lots of comfort features for the money. The Windsor EV was already easy to recommend as an electric car. And the Windsor EV Pro is even more so. Also See: MG Windsor Pro video review",

It’s not as settled as, say, a Tata Nexon EV.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/MG Windsor Pro rear quarter tracking.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRide quality isn\u0026#39;t as settled as some of its rivals.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003ePress down on the brake pedal, and you’ll find the Windsor that’s equipped with disc brakes on all four wheels to drop speed with confidence. There’s regen braking, too, with three levels on offer, and you can feel the difference between the levels. However, it lacks the one-pedal drive feature, and there are no physical controls such as paddle shifters to toggle between the regen levels. You have to go into the touchscreen menus, which isn’t ideal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMG Windsor EV Pro range - 8/10\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHas an ARAI-claimed range of 449km \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe biggest update on the Windsor EV Pro is under the skin. The standard Windsor EV’s 38kWh battery makes way for a 52.9kWh one on the Pro. Consequently, the ARAI-tested range figure jumps to 449km on a single charge from 332km on the standard car.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e  While we will do a full range test when we get the car for a longer duration in Mumbai, it must be mentioned that the standard Windsor’s 308km real-world range achieved over our test loop was very close to the claimed 332km figure. Should the EV Pro deliver the similar efficiency, it’s safe to assume real-world range in the region of 400km-plus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMG Windsor EV Pro price and verdict - 8/10\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRemains a very likeable car with the bonus of added range\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you were drawn to the MG Windsor EV Pro’s tempting Rs 17.49 lakh launch price, you should know you’ve missed the bus. It was valid only for the first 8,000 buyers. MG has bumped up Windsor EV Pro’s ex-showroom price to Rs 18.1 lakh, which is Rs 2.1 lakh higher than the Windsor with the smaller battery. The added outlay gets you a few more features, but the real hook is the enhanced range. For anyone intending to use their vehicle for intercity commutes, it’s the easy pick of the range.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/MG_Windsor_EV_Pro_Rear_Quarter_Static.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe new Pro variant is the pick of the range for intercity commutes.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eMG should have worked on the user interface, too, and the ADAS calibration seems rushed, but in other areas, the Windsor EV Pro is very likeable. The roomy cabin makes it a family-friendly choice, performance is pleasant, and you get lots of comfort features for the money. The Windsor EV was already easy to recommend as an electric car.
