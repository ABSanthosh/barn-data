  "text": "President Biden’s administration approved of California’s gas vehicle phase-out plans, but today, President Trump took action to block the state’s electrification efforts. The president signed joint resolutions earlier today that block California’s eventual gas-vehicle sales prohibition. The resolutions were passed in May, and they carry the force of law once signed. That said, the signing will almost certainly trigger legal challenges, and Governor Gavin Newsom is directing state officials to find another path forward toward phasing out gas vehicles.Despite buying a Tesla on the White House lawn, President Trump has pretty consistently said he wants more incentives for gas cars and that he wants to open more drilling for oil. By signing the resolutions, Trump is reversing a decision made under the Clean Air Act of 1970, which allowed the state to set more restrictive pollution requirements than federal regulations. California officials said they would respond in two parts to the signing, starting with filing a lawsuit asking a judge to overturn the resolutions. Newsom said he would direct his staff to develop alternative regulations that reward compliant automakers and incentivize the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs).The governor also said Trump’s move would destroy California’s clean air and the country’s competitiveness. The signing comes after Trump sent the National Guard and troops into Los Angeles to respond to immigration protestors, setting off a huge legal battle and fierce pushback.[Images: Alexandra Bilham, Hairem, JW.photography31 via Shutterstock]Become a TTAC insider.
