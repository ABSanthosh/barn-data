  "description": "This 1993 Porsche Carrera RSR 3.8 is one of 51 examples built during a single year of production to help homologate the model for GT competition and was completed in December 1993 on order for Mark Sandridge’s Team Salad Racing. During the ensuing season, chassis 496081 finished second in its class and fourth overall at the 1994 24 Hours of Daytona before earning class wins at the 12 Hours of Sebring and Watkins Glen 6 Hours en route to the IMSA GT2 Championship. The car was sold in 1996 to a Georgia owner who campaigned it in SCCA and Porsche Club of America events through the mid-2000s, when it was purchased by Travis drummer Neil Primrose in the UK. Finished in Grand Prix White with a Team Salad Racing livery, the car is powered by a 3.8-liter M64/04 flat-six that was updated with a slide-valve fuel-injection system under previous ownership. Additional features include a five-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential, cross-drilled and ventilated disc brakes, three-way adjustable Koni shock absorbers, staggered-width 18” BBS multipiece wheels, aluminum opening panels, a fiberglass rear wing, a fuel cell, a welded-in roll cage, and a Recaro racing seat with a six-point harness. Purchased by the current owner five years ago, this 964 Carrera RSR is now offered in Miami, Florida, on dealer consignment with a copy of its Manufacturer’s Certificate of Origin, factory order documents, invoices, a collection of spare parts, and a bill of sale.",

Finished in Grand Prix White with a Team Salad Racing livery, the car is powered by a 3.8-liter M64/04 flat-six that was updated with a slide-valve fuel-injection system under previous ownership. Additional features include a five-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential, cross-drilled and ventilated disc brakes, three-way adjustable Koni shock absorbers, staggered-width 18” BBS multipiece wheels, aluminum opening panels, a fiberglass rear wing, a fuel cell, a welded-in roll cage, and a Recaro racing seat with a six-point harness. Purchased by the current owner five years ago, this 964 Carrera RSR is now offered in Miami, Florida, on dealer consignment with a copy of its Manufacturer’s Certificate of Origin, factory order documents, invoices, a collection of spare parts, and a bill of sale. The Carrera RSR 3.8 was introduced in 1993 as a turnkey customer racing variant of the road-going Carrera RS, with which it shared its widebody shell, aluminum hood panel and doors, thin-gauge side and rear glass, and adjustable rear wing. The model made its debut at the 1993 24 Hours of Daytona, where it swept the first four places in the GTU class, and later accounted for a class win at Le Mans and overall victories at the Spa 24 Hours, the Nürburgring 24 Hours, and the 1000km Interlagos. This example was delivered in Grand Prix White and currently wears a multicolor livery replicating that worn by the car during its fifth-place overall finish and class win at the 1994 12 Hours of Sebring. According to the selling dealer, repairs were made to the left-front of the tub after a crash on track. Features include hood and decklid retention pins, front and rear tow hooks, a chin spoiler, dual side mirrors, sliding windows, and a red RSR decklid badge. Multipiece 18” BBS center-lock wheels feature gold-painted spokes and are wrapped in Dunlop SP Sport tires measuring 250/640 up front and 285/650 at the rear. Two sets of spare wheels are included in the sale and are pictured in the photo gallery below. Stopping is handled by Brembo disc brakes with cross-drilled and ventilated rotors, red-painted four-piston calipers with Porsche script, and a Porsche Motorsport ABS system. The RSR model was delivered from the factory with a welded-in roll cage and other safety equipment. This example’s cockpit houses a Recaro racing seat, a red Schroth six-point racing harness, a fire-suppression system, and an electrical cutoff switch. The three-spoke MOMO steering wheel sits on a quick-release hub ahead of a central tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline. VDO instrumentation includes a 300-km/h speedometer, a Quarz clock, and combination gauges monitoring fuel level, oil level, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 25k kilometers (~16k miles), approximately 700 of which have been added under current ownership. The RSR’s 3,746cc M64/04 flat-six was a derivative of the RS’s powerplant but featured uprated camshafts, larger valves, and a higher compression ratio. This example was reportedly fitted with a slide-valve throttle-body system under previous ownership. The fuel cell is said to have been replaced in 2020, and fluid changes were performed two years ago. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential and a racing clutch. Suspension incorporates three-way adjustable Koni shock absorbers and adjustable sway bars at each end. A factory invoice dated September 15, 1993, lists the sale of the car to Mark Sandridge with options including center wheel locks and an air jack system for a total of 249.592.60 Deutschemarks. Additional factory correspondence and literature can be viewed in the gallery, as can the car’s Manufacturer’s Statement of Origin, various invoices, logbooks covering the late 1990s and early 2000s, and articles featuring the car. The car is shown above during its class victory at the 1994 12 Hours of Sebring and its second-in-class finish at Daytona, and additional photos from its early racing career are included in the sale.
