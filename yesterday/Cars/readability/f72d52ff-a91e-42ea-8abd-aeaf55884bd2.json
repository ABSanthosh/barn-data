  "text": "The model would have been smaller than the Rogue, which might have limited its appeal January 22, 2025 at 19:00 by Michael Gauthier Nissan has reportedly decided against building a subcompact electric crossover in the United States. The model, reportedly codenamed PZ1L, would be larger than a Leaf, but smaller than a Rogue. The SUV is still expected to be built in the United Kingdom, but it likely won’t be offered stateside. Nissan was one of the original proponents of electric vehicles as they introduced the Leaf in 2009. Despite a massive head start, the company doesn’t have much to show for it other than the Ariya. That’s not to say the automaker didn’t try as we’ve seen numerous projects announced and then delayed or killed off entirely. The most memorable example is the Infiniti LE from over a decade ago but, more recently, the company delayed a pair of electric sedans that were slated to be built in Canton, Mississippi. More: Nissan Delays US-Built Electric Sedans, Plans Rogue-Sized EV The revisions continue today as Auto News is reporting Nissan has decided against building a subcompact electric crossover in Canton. The model was reportedly codenamed the PZ1L and it would have been larger than the Leaf, but smaller than the Rogue. While it sounds like America will miss out on the model, the vehicle is still slated to be built at the company’s Sunderland plant in England. However, Nissan still has plans to build two other electric crossovers at their U.S. facility. Nissan’s Brian Brockman told Auto News they want to focus on the other EVs that will be made in Mississippi. He went on to suggest they’ll be better suited for the U.S. market and sell in higher volumes. While a number of questions remain, it’s believed slower than expected electric vehicle adoption played a role in the decision. President Trump’s return to the White House has also added a lot of uncertainty as he has promised to “end the Green New Deal” and “revoke the electric vehicle mandate.” He’s also expected to try eliminating the $7,500 clean vehicle tax credit, which would make EVs significantly more expensive.
