  "text": "The climate controlled garage has a power door and expansive windows December 13, 2024 at 19:50 by Michael Gauthier Fahrengold has introduced the Bugatti Edition FG-01 Garage, which is designed to store and showcase hypercars. It‘s a climate controlled box with a power door, fancy lights, and leather-wrapped cupboards. The garage takes eight days to install and has a climate control system as well as security features. If there’s a Bugatti owner on your holiday shopping list, you’re in luck as the company has teamed up with Fahrengold to offer the Bugatti Edition FG-01 Garage. It’s a “museum-inspired” box that is billed as the perfect place to store and showcase your hypercar. Measuring 242 inches (6,147 mm) long and 144 inches (3,658 mm) wide, the FG-01 features a galvanized steel frame, colored aluminum panels, and expansive windows made from security glass. They’re joined by a power door featuring an illuminated “EB” logo. More: Aston Martin’s Q Division Will Build You A Bespoke Garage Once inside, owners will find a sophisticated showcase with dimmable LED lights and leather-clad cupboards. The garage also has a display area for collectibles and a “personalized plaque reflecting the owner’s specific vehicle.” Other highlights include gel tire cushions and backlit Bugatti lettering. That brings us to museum-like features that include temperature and humidity regulation through an electric heating and cooling system. They’re joined by a security camera, smoke detector, and glass breakage sensor. The garage consists of 2,500 individual pieces and takes approximately eight days to assemble. There’s no word on pricing, but the FG-01 is customizable and apparently takes more than three months to create. Those short on space can opt for Bugatti Edition CarPads, which have a carbon fiber or anodized aluminum frame, gel tire cushions, and LEDs that provide “dramatic uplighting.” They also have a brushed aluminum badge, while the Pro version adds an illuminated “EB” logo.",
