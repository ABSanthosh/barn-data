The car was ordered by the seller through Pat Milliken Ford in Redford, Michigan, and now has 13 miles. Finished in Alan Mann Red over Ebony Alcantara upholstery, it is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. Factory-specified equipment includes the Gloss Exterior Carbon-Fiber Package, 20″ exposed carbon-fiber wheels, six-point harness anchors, and red brushed paddle shifters in addition to an Akrapovič titanium exhaust system, Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, a retractable active rear wing, a rear diffuser, butterfly doors, Sparco seats, and a touchscreen infotainment system. This Ford GT was listed on BaT in October 2024 and is now offered again with a window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title in the name of the seller’s LLC. First unveiled at the 2015 North American International Auto Show, the Chris Svensson–designed second-generation GT was built by Multimatic of Markham, Ontario, with production beginning in December 2016. The car features a carbon-fiber monocoque structure bolted to front and rear aluminum subframes that serve as stressed members for the hydraulically adjustable pushrod suspension system. Variable ride height, a front-axle lift system, launch control, and selectable driving modes were equipped from the factory. This example is finished Alan Mann Red with gold and Frozen White stripes as well as #16 roundels and is equipped with the Gloss Exterior Carbon-Fiber Package. Additional features include LED lighting, a lightweight Gorilla Glass windshield, butterfly doors, a retractable active rear wing, and a rear diffuser. The 20″ carbon-fiber wheels are mounted utilizing titanium lug nuts and wrapped with 245/35 front and 325/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. Braking is handled by black-finished Brembo six-piston monoblock calipers over 15.5” carbon-ceramic discs up front, while four-piston calipers are mounted over 14.1” units out back. Ebony Alcantara trim with gold and red accent stitching was specified with the Alan Mann Heritage Edition along with exposed carbon fiber door panel inserts wearing #16 roundels. The fixed-position Sparco seats incorporate manually reclining carbon-fiber shells, and the driver’s seat is paired with an adjustable steering column and pedal box. Six-point harness anchors were optioned from the factory, and additional equipment includes a touchscreen infotainment system, automatic climate control, and cruise control. The F1-inspired steering wheel is wrapped in Alcantara and fronts red brushed paddle shifters as well as a configurable digital instrument panel. The digital odometer indicates 13 miles. The twin-turbocharged 3.5L EcoBoost V6 is mounted aft of the cabin and was factory rated at 660 horsepower and 550 lb-ft of torque. A carbon-fiber engine cover and an Akrapovič titanium exhaust system were equipped from the factory. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Getrag seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. The underside features front and rear carbon-fiber aero panels. The window sticker lists initial delivery through Pat Milliken Ford in Redford, Michigan, as well as factory colors, equipment, and a total MSRP of $769,500. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage. The most recent entry in December 2022 notes a lien, though it was released in August 2024. You are not connected to real-time updates.
