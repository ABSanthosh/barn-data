Power is provided by a 4.7-liter V8 linked with a four-speed automatic transmission, a dual-range transfer case, and a locking center differential. The truck is finished in Black Onyx over Ivory leather upholstery and features 16″ twin five-spoke alloy wheels, Adaptive Variable Suspension with Adjustable Height Control, a power sunroof, front and rear automatic climate controls, a Mark Levinson sound system, a Kenwood touchscreen stereo with Bluetooth, heated power-adjustable front seats, and third-row seating. This LX470 is now offered with the owner’s manual, two keys, first-aid and tool kits, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title. The truck is finished in Black Onyx and features a power sunroof, projector-style headlights, fog lights, roof rails, running boards, a receiver hitch, a split tailgate, and a rear window wiper. Photos of paint meter readings are provided in the gallery below. Chrome-plated 16″ twin five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with 275/70 Yokohama Geolandar A/T tires showing date codes from 2022. The truck is equipped with Adaptive Variable Suspension featuring driver-selected Adjustable Height Control, and braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated discs. The three-row cabin features Ivory leather seating surfaces along with matching carpets and a two-tone dashboard and door panels. Burl wood veneers accent the center console, gear selector, and doors. Amenities include heated power-adjustable front seats, driver-seat position memory, front and rear automatic climate controls, cruise control, a Mark Levinson sound system, and an aftermarket Kenwood touchscreen stereo with Bluetooth connectivity. The split-folding tailgate opens to reveal folding and removable third-row seating. The four-spoke leather- and wood-rimmed steering wheel frames a 130-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and gauges for voltage, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 50k miles, approximately 250 of which were added under current ownership. The 4.7-liter 2UZ-FE V8 was factory rated at 230 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to all four wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission, a dual-range transfer case, and a locking center differential. Additional underside photos are provided below. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
