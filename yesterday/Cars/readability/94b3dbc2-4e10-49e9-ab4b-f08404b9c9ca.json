  "description": "Before I start telling you about this unique-looking bag, I have a confession to make: I have organisational OCD and am a creature of habit. I can’t stand disarray of any sort when it comes to packing my belongings, and the way I pack follows the saying – ‘a place for everything, and everything in its place.’ That’s why the Kriega Sling Pro Messenger Bag fits neatly into my life and has become my go-to bag for nearly everything over the past four months, from daily commutes to weekend trips and even shopping. Main pocket is quite deep. This bag is divided into three main compartments comprising an absolutely waterproof main compartment that holds seven litres, accompanied by two ancillary zippered ones that can hold a total of another seven. While seven litres may sound small, I have been able to fit two boxes containing my office lunch, a couple of t-shirts, and a 1-litre water bottle, with quite some room to spare. Kriega claims you can fit a 14-inch laptop into this compartment, but I’ve fit my colleague’s 15-inch one without hassle. Waist belt helps reduce load on your shoulder. Then, there are the two secondary zippered pockets, one larger than the other. Both appear quite slim at first glance, but as you’ll discover, this small bag is capable of holding much more than you think. The larger zippered pocket can hold a thick 500-page novel, a 750ml water bottle, a chunky power bank and my phone charger. In the smaller one, I usually have my old-fashioned leather wallet, sunscreen, a spare pair of spectacles, my Bluetooth earphones and house keys. As is evident, if you’re meticulous about how you pack your things, the Messenger Pro can swallow a lot. Total 14 litres of storage available. Since this is a sling bag, you get one main strap, which you sling across your torso, and anyone who has worn one will tell you that it can get a little uncomfortable on its own after some time. Thankfully, Kriega has also supplied a sturdy waist belt that alleviates most of the pressure from your shoulder. I’ve worn this bag all day for multiple days in a row, and I’m happy to report that you don’t feel any discomfort for the first 5-6 hours. After that, you will start to feel some soreness, but you can always reverse the strap’s mounting to the other side and sling it on the opposite shoulder. At Rs 15,799, the Kriega Sling Pro Messenger Bag is unquestionably a luxurious indulgence. That holds true even in the Kriega context because there are other similarly priced or more affordable backpacks from the same company that are more versatile, spacious and can even be equipped with a hydration bladder. So, to answer the all-important question: to buy or not to buy? The thing is, you’ve got to particularly want this form factor. I can confirm that it works well in an urban context while also being a bit of a unique style statement from a motorcycling perspective. But, if that’s not a particular priority, and if this is your first step into the world of Kriega, you will find some more versatile personal luggage-carrying options.
