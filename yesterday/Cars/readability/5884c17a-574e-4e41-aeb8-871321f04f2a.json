  "description": "The 2025 Americas MotoGP race had all the makings of an unpredictable roller coaster ride – an aborted race start, a factory Ducati other than Marc Marquez’s winning the race, and his younger brother Alex Marquez actually taking the lead in the World Championship. Marc Marquez crashed out of the lead, and his teammate Francesco Bagnaia capitalised on that by taking the win in this race. Alex Marquez, who now leads the standings, finished second, and Fabio Di Giannantonio took the chequered flag in third place. Alex leads the championship and is just a point ahead of Marc Yamaha bags a top-five finish with Jack Miller Bagnaia takes his 30th MotoGP win Ducati victorious at COTA, but not Marc After his victory in the Sprint race on Saturday, Marc Marquez looked nigh unstoppable as he extended his winning streak, and he looked all but set to win at his favourite track for a seventh time. And up until he lowsided at Turn 3 on Lap 9, when he already had a very comfortable 2-second lead over his brother Alex, Marc appeared to have it all in the bag. After that, once Bagnaia took the lead, he pretty much stayed there with a comfortable buffer to his sibling. This win was Bagnaia’s first this season, and he now has 30 race victories to his name.   Yamaha makes good progress; Miller in top 5   It wouldn’t be overstating things when we say that Yamaha has fallen from glory in recent years in MotoGP. However, a strong pre-season has finally started to translate into credible results for the Iwata-based factory. Jack Miller took his satellite Pramac machine to a top-five finish (Fermin Aldeguer’s late race crash is partly to thank here) and was the highest-ranked non-Ducati rider.   In fact, this race saw all four Yamaha machines finish in the points. Fabio Quartararo finished 10th, teammate Alex Rins was 11th, and Augusto Fernandez (reserve rider standing in for Miguel Oliveira) finished 13th.  Bastianini’s P7 silver lining to KTM’s dark cloud   The factory KTM duo of Brad Binder and Pedro Acosta had a good start to the 2025 Americas GP, and they were troubling the top five in the early stages of the race. But it wouldn’t last for long as Acosta crashed out first, followed shortly by Binder. And since Maverick Vinales had an issue during the second (and final) race start, the task of upholding KTM’s honour fell squarely on Enea Bastianini’s shoulders. Thankfully, ‘the Beast’ is known to be a tyre whisperer (an expert at managing tyres throughout race distance), and a strong turn of pace in the later stages of the race saw him cross the chequered flag in seventh place. Teammate Vinales finished 14th to take home two points.    2025 MotoGP standings   A Marquez still leads the standings, but it’s the younger sibling, Alex, who has a slender one-point lead over his brother Marc. With his victory here, Bagnaia has handsomely closed down the deficit to the Marquez brothers and is just 12 points adrift of the lead. The next race will be held at the Lusail International Circuit in Doha, Qatar, on April 13.  2025 Americas GP results 2025 Americas MotoGP resultsPositionRiderTeam1Francesco BagnaiaDucati2Alex MarquezGresini Ducati3Fabio Di GiannantonioVR46 Ducati4Franco MorbidelliVR46 Ducati5Jack Miller Pramac Yamaha6Marco BezzecchiAprilia7Enea BastianiniTech3 KTM 8Luca Marini Honda9Ai OguraTrackhouse Aprilia10Fabio QuartararoYamaha11Alex RinsYamaha12Raul FernandezTrackhouse Aprilia13Augusto FernandezPramac Yamaha14Maverick Vinales Tech3 KTM 15Lorenzo SavadoriAprilia16Somkiat ChantraLCR Honda17Johann Zarco LCR HondaNCMarc MarquezDucatiNCBrad BinderKTMNC Pedro AcostaKTMNC Joan MirHondaNC Fermin AldeguerGresini Ducati",
