  "text": "Shareholders are turning on Musk, sensing that he‚Äôs all but forgotten about their concerns February 28, 2025 at 19:25 by Stephen Rivers Shareholders are criticizing Elon Musk amidst Tesla‚Äôs 23% stock decline this year. The carmaker‚Äôs CEO faces backlash for his perceived focus on non-Tesla projects. Online responses mirror Musk‚Äôs own DOGE email request to federal employees. ‚ÄúPlease share 5 things you did for $TSLA shareholders this week.‚Äù That‚Äôs just the opening line of a pointed message aimed directly at Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and it‚Äôs not even the harshest part. With Tesla‚Äôs stock value down roughly 23 percent this year, shareholders are understandably frustrated. Now, it seems the unease is spreading beyond just the folks with skin in the game. Read: ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Buy A Swasticar‚Äô Ad Campaign Targets Musk In London It‚Äôs no surprise that shareholders are upset over a massive drop in valuation. But it‚Äôs clear from their online responses that they‚Äôre aiming to hit Musk where it hurts. Last week, in his role as head of the newly minted Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), he sent an email to federal employees asking them to share five things they‚Äôd accomplished at work. Now, shareholders are flipping the script, turning that same question back on him. The Five-Thing Challenge On X (formerly Twitter), multiple users responded to Musk or called him out directly with messages like: ‚ÄúHi @elonmusk can you please tell us 5 things you did last week? ü§î‚Äù One user even paired their comment with a screenshot showing Tesla stock down $27.57 or 8.34% at that time during that single day. It‚Äôs far from the only one with the same sort of verbiage and media. Another one read in its entirety, ‚ÄúPlease share 5 things you did for $TSLA shareholders this week. Or are you working remotely? Asking for all of us.‚Äù This one came with a graph that shows Tesla‚Äôs stock price since the start of the year and how it‚Äôs down $84.06 per share or 21.55 percent. That last bit about working remotely is itself a dig at Musk as well. Morality and Remote Work The Tesla boss has publicly called out those who work remotely several times. He‚Äôs gone as far as to actually call working remotely morally wrong. His argument is that several people don‚Äôt have the option to work remotely, so nobody should. That hasn‚Äôt stopped him from seemingly focusing his efforts more so on the Department of Governmental Efficiency than on Tesla or SpaceX in recent weeks. Whatever he‚Äôs up to, his actions appear to be affecting more than just shareholders. According to The Independent, even Tesla employees are worried about the potential long-term impact on the brand. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives says that the pressure might become too much too. ‚ÄúInvestors have patience but this is starting to tip the scale and it‚Äôs weighing on shares along with brand issues related to Musk/Tesla,‚Äù he said to Barron‚Äôs. ‚ÄúPerception becomes reality on Wall Street.‚Äù Even some celebrities are calling out Musk for his apparent lack of focus on Tesla. Media mogul David Portnoy, for one, took to Twitter to ask, ‚ÄúHow far does TSLA stock have to crash before Elon goes back to work?‚Äù He‚Äôs not alone in wondering whether Musk‚Äôs attention might be better spent on Tesla‚Äôs challenges than on his other ventures. With stockholders and analysts openly questioning his priorities, Musk might need more than witty tweets and philosophical debates to turn things around. At this point, Musk might be banking on a dramatic reveal of serious Level 5 self-driving tech to save face later this year. If I‚Äôm gonna be fair these questions needs to be asked today. Why is the release of the Epstein list always a shit show? What‚Äôs the point of booting out illegals and criminals while somehow becoming a safe haven for the Tate brothers?Why is Crypto in the toilet if Trump‚Ä¶‚Äî Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 27, 2025",
