  "text": "The company did not name tariffs or any other recent trade actions as the cause, but said that “Subaru pricing is not based on the country of origin of its products.” The price changes should start showing up on dealers’ lots next month and will add between $750 and $2,055 to many models’ bottom line. While Subaru builds a significant number of vehicles in the U.S., around 45 percent of the vehicles it sells here are imported. The Forester’s pricing is one of the more notable changes, climbing between $1,075 and $1,600, depending on the trim level. The current SUV’s reasonable price tag spans from the low $30,000 mark to the low $40,000 range, so the price increases will look and feel substantial to value-conscious buyers. Some automakers have pledged to hold pricing at pre-tariff levels for a time, but others have opted not to eat the price increases. Ford increased prices on some Mexican-made models in early May by up to $2,000 in response to the tariffs, while others have considered relocating some international production lines to the United States.
