  "text": "The Cybertruck was poised to dominate the sales chart, but now it's being beaten by a Ford May 15, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier A new report suggests the Ford F-150 Lightning is outselling the Tesla Cybertruck. More Fords than Cybertrucks were registered in March as well as in the first quarter. The Cybertruck has bombed with consumers as Tesla over-promised and under-delivered. Remember when Tesla CEO Elon Musk proclaimed demand for the Cybertruck was “off the charts” and the company had secured over a million reservations? That feels like a distant memory, as far fewer consumers now seem interested in the electric pickup. While the Cybertruck was expected to dominate, it’s now playing second fiddle to the Ford F-150 Lightning. That’s according to Auto News, which is citing registration data from S\u0026P Global Mobility. More: These Are America’s Best Selling EVs In Q1 2025 According to the publication, 2,598 Lightning’s were registered in March compared to 2,170 Cybertrucks. While that’s only a difference of 428 units, it’s a big win for Ford and an embarrassing black eye for Tesla. Unfortunately for the Tesla faithful, it’s not an isolated incident either. Quite the opposite as 7,913 electric Ford pickups were registered in the United States during the first quarter. That put them 787 units ahead of Tesla, which trailed at 7,126. The reasons for the Cybertruck’s failure are readily apparent as the production model fell far short of earlier promises. Back in 2019, Tesla said pricing would start at $39,900 for an entry-level variant with rear-wheel drive and 250+ miles (402+ km) of range. More: What Happened To Musk’s 1 Million Cybertruck Reservations? Fast forward to today and the cheapest model is listed at $69,990 with rear-wheel drive. However, it’s slated to have a range of approximately 350 miles (563 km). While the extra range is welcome, the $30,090 price increase certainly isn’t. Interestingly, the rear-wheel drive variant costs more than the dual-motor all-wheel drive model was supposed to. It was expected to start at $49,900 but you’ll actually have to shell out $79,990 for one today. While the massive switcheroo was revealed in November of 2023, things have only gotten worse for Tesla and the Cybertruck. Most notably, Elon Musk and his company have become a political lightning rod putting owners and dealerships in the crosshairs.",
