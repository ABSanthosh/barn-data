What that means this time of year is that we’re difficult to shop for, and unless the motorcycle enthusiast on your list has left comprehensive hints, it can be difficult to find something better than Amazon’s search suggestions. As riders of the most discerning taste, we feel it’s our responsibility to contribute to the cause with some of our recent favorites. Whether it’s a stocking stuffer or a single gift to knock ’em dead, you’ll find inspiration in the 2024 Bike EXIF Holiday Gift Guide. Bike EXIF Two-Stroke Motorcycle T-Shirt There’s no easier and more affordable way to put a smile on someone’s face (and some needed variation to their wardrobe) than a rad graphic tee, and we just dropped six fresh designs on the Bike EXIF store. While we gladly rock them all, the new Two-Stroke tee deserves today’s time in the limelight. Boasting the righteous ratio on the front, the oil can art comes courtesy of Perth’s own Cheyne Speak, the postman with a talent for building killer custom bikes under the name SPKS Lab. Everyone loves two-strokes, but Cheyne lives the pre-mix life and we featured his stellar Suzuki TS185 tracker build back in 2022. Real ones know, and if the enthusiast on your list often reeks of Klotz, Redline or Spectro, this tee’s a no-brainer. Find it here on the Bike EXIF Store. Biltwell El Dorado ShirtJack As we wave farewell to autumn and go into the winter months, the chronic tinkerer in your life is about to descend into a period of late nights in the garage. Helmets and riding gear will be stowed away, traded for shop shirts and safety glasses, and the right piece of insulated gear could be just the thing to keep your riding enthusiast warm and sane in the coming months. Rugged enough for the garage, and stylish for a night on the town, Biltwell’s El Dorado ShirtJack is one we’re hoping to unwrap on Christmas morning. The El Dorado is made with a flexible canvas shell with a fleece polyester liner for added core warmth. Five pockets are built in, ensuring you have adequate storage for your phone, wallet, key fob and various fasteners you find on the garage floor. Designed by riders, Biltwell included several practical features like elastic thumb loops and hidden snaps on collar tips to eliminate flapping at high speeds. The El Dorado is available in black and navy colors, and if you ask us, there’s no wrong choice. [Biltwell] mo.view classic 60 Mirror Putting it bluntly, stock mirrors suck, and I’ve never met a fellow rider who wouldn’t agree. They’re always plastic and look like a chunky afterthought, inspiring many to spin their mirrors off for good in pursuit of more pure aesthetics. But anyone who’s ridden around without mirrors long enough will tell you, your neck doesn’t appreciate the continuous blind spot checks. If only someone made a quality mirror befitting a custom motorcycle… We’re constantly impressed by the quality, well-thought-out components to come out of motogadget’s Berlin facility, and their solution to the OE mirror epidemic is second to none. Take the mo.view classic 60 for example. It’s a high-quality CNC machined aluminum mirror that’s no bigger than it needs to be, so it won’t cramp your style. The hardware is all stainless, and the precision ball joint and adjustable mount hold the mirror firmly in adjustment whether you mount it above or below the handlebar. The mo.view’s real party piece is its reflective surface though, as it uses a highly-polished, plasma-coated aluminum instead of glass. Not only is it cool, but it really works, and you won’t find a higher-quality piece on any shelf. If the moto enthusiast in your life has bare handlebars, save them a cranked neck and a fix-it ticket with a mo.view. It’s certainly a gift they won’t see coming. [motogadget] Saint Inside Out Gloves While it will be months before a good portion of us get to push our motorcycles out of the garage again, nothing enhances the experience quite like new gear. Pricey items like a new helmet or jacket can be risky unless they’ve left you comprehensive hints, but a quality pair of riding gloves will keep them fired up during the off-season, and the Inside Out gloves from Saint are our current favorite. The Inside Outs are designed with a classic worker glove aesthetic and made from premium goat leather that feels broken in right out of the box. What makes them special is that all the seams are on the exterior and the inside of the glove is perfectly smooth—leading to all-day comfort. Hidden CE-rated armor is built into the palms and knuckles, and the stretchable cuffs have a beefy velcro strap for adjustment. For quick pit stops, the index fingers feature touchscreen-compatible material as well. A perfect mix of comfort, practical protection and reserved styling, the Inside Outs from Saint are our current go-to’s, and we’re confident the moto enthusiasts on your list will feel the same. They’re available in five sizes and three colorways here on the Bike EXIF Store. [Saint] Kruk Garage WS003 Tool Roll It’s the type of thing gearheads don’t think about before embarking on a journey, not until they’re stranded anyway. A quality tool roll can save them some roadside embarrassment—and save you a late-night call to bring a 10 mm wrench. Kyiv-based Kruk Garage specializes in handmade leather goods with an emphasis on utilizing found materials, such as buckles, hardware and fabrics from decades prior. This extra effort, combined with genuine leather, makes for an exceptional tool roll that has twice the appeal of something made from canvas with plastic buckles. The WS003 fits up to 18 wrenches and has a YKK zipper pocket for stashing small sockets, tapes, fuses and more. It measures 30 by 50 cm [11.8 x 19.7 inches] open and rolls up to around 13 cm [5.1 inches] when full. The waxed saddle leather finish wears in instead of out and is available in five unique color combos. [Kruk Garage] motogadget mo.unit blue It’s probably uncouth to feature a brand twice in this roundup, but we feel the message is more important than getting called out for playing favorites. We’re in the middle of wiring a bike as we speak, so there’s no better time to talk about this gamechanger in motorcycle electrics—the motogadget mo.unit blue. Grossly oversimplifying, the mo.unit blue is a complete digital control unit that reinvents the process of wiring your motorcycle. There are dedicated inputs and outputs for all your major functions, and the independently monitored circuits take the place of your factory fusebox. Relays for flashers, starter motors, hazards and other functions are completely taken over by the mo.unit, and the Bluetooth connection brings loads of modern features (like keyless starting) to your classic motorcycle. We’ll detail more on motogadget’s mo.unit blue in upcoming features, but for now, suffice it to say there’s no simpler and more complete solution for motorcycle wiring on the market. If you or someone you know is undertaking a ground-up motorcycle build, the mo.unit blue is the gift that keeps giving. [motogadget] Harley-Davidson Sportster Tracker by Mule If the motorcycle enthusiast in your life has gone above and beyond this year, then the best gift is one that doesn’t fit under the tree, and they’re sure to feel like a kid again aboard this Harley Sportster tracker by Mule. Certainly the most hoon-happy ride on the Bike EXIF Classifieds, this Sporty was built by Mule’s Richard Pollock for the 2023 Hooligan series. The build started with a 1987 Harley-Davidson Sportster frame, repowered by a NOS Buell Lighting X1 B motor. With less than ten races on it, she’s barely broke in. The mod list is long, but the high points include a Mule 2-1 SS exhaust, JJ Flarity de-rake kit, Lowery Racing wheels, K-Tech Razor adjustable shocks, fiberglass tank and tail with Corbin seat pad and indestructible Afam handlebars. Voted one of our Top 10 Customs of 2023, this Mule Sporty is ready to return to the Hooligan series or transition to street tracker duty with minimal effort. While they say money can’t buy happiness, frowning is physically impossible in the saddle of a machine like this—and you can take that to the bank. [Bart Cepek, courtesy of Mule]",
