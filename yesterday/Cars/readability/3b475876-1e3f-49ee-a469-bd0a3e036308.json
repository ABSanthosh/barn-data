  "text": "The one-off, which is actually the 2001 ALMS championship-winning race car, celebrates the 30th anniversary of the Need for Speed series November 28, 2024 at 19:47 by Brad Anderson This is the same very BMW M3 GTR that won the 2001 ALMS GT Series. Power comes courtesy of a 4.0-liter naturally-aspirated V8 with 450 hp. The blue and silver M3 GTR was featured on the cover of NFS: Most Wanted in 2005. Perhaps the single most iconic car from the Need for Speed gaming franchise has been brought to life by BMW, and it’s now on display at the BMW Welt museum in Germany until early January 2025. For gamers and car enthusiasts alike, this is a chance to see a piece of virtual history made real. We’re, of course, talking about the unmistakable silver and blue M3 GTR from Need for Speed: Most Wanted. The ninth installment in the Need for Speed series was released way back in 2005 and featured the E46 M3 GTR on the cover. At the time of its release, Most Wanted was awarded critical acclaim and is still considered by many (myself included) as the finest NFS game. I played it for hours on end when I was a kid, and the M3 GTR was my favorite car – alongside a bright blue Porsche Carrera GT I added to my garage. Read: ‘Need For Speed Unbound’ Revealed With Flashy Graphics And Highly-Detailed Performance Cars Over the years, plenty of BMW owners have made their M3s look like the car from the game, but only now has BMW itself made it a reality. It celebrates the 30th anniversary of Need for Speed series and coincides with the car being added to the latest DLC for Need for Speed: Unbound, first released in 2022. Working in partnership with Electronic Arts, BMW has designed a silver and blue livery for the M3, which perfectly replicates the car from the game. This is no road-going E46 M3 either, and it’s the #42 BMW E46 M3 GTR that was raced by Jörg Müller and J.J. Lehto in 2001. Not only is this a legitimate M3 GTR, but it won both the 2001 ALMS GT Series drivers’ and constructors’ championship. One of the reasons the M3 GTR holds such a special place in history is its engineering. Unlike the standard E46 M3, which came with an inline-six engine, the GTR featured a race-bred 4.0-liter naturally aspirated V8 producing around 450 hp. If you live in Germany or plan to visit in the coming months, don’t miss the chance to see the M3 GTR in person. Head to the BMW Welt museum, where the car will remain on display until early January 2025.",
