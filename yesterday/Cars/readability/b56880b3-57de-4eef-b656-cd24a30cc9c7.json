In the Performance variant, BYD has added its new DiSus-C damping system, which can soften the suspension on bumpy roads and stiffen it during cornering, acceleration and braking – all in real-time. New Seal booking details Starting March 11, buyers can book the 2025 Seal by depositing Rs 1.25 lakh, but the price announcement will happen in April. 2025 BYD Atto 3 new features The latest Atto 3 gets an all-black (previously three-tone) interior with ventilated front seats.
