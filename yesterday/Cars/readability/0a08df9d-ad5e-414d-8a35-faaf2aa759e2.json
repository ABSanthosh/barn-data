  "description": "This 1963.5 Ford Falcon Sprint was built by vintage race car specialists Dralle Engineering around 2014. It started as a California black plate car and was fitted with a 331ci V8 equipped with Edelbrock aluminum cylinder heads, Mahle forged pistons, and an Eagle crankshaft and connecting rods. A Tremec TKO five-speed manual transmission, four-wheel disc brakes with Lincoln front calipers, red leather Cobra bucket seats, a dash-mounted Smiths tachometer, a MotoLita steering wheel, an exhaust system with cut-outs, and an upgraded clutch, flywheel, drive shaft, rear end, and suspension were also installed. It was offered on BaT in 2016 and then given a Ford France rally-style makeover the following year. BaT co-founder Randy Nonnenberg bought the car in 2022 and further refined it, and it was driven in that year's Copperstate 1000 as well as to numerous BaT events across California. The Falcon is now offered on dealer consignment with build records, service records, and a clean California title.",

It started as a California black plate car and was fitted with a 331ci V8 equipped with Edelbrock aluminum cylinder heads, Mahle forged pistons, and an Eagle crankshaft and connecting rods. A Tremec TKO five-speed manual transmission, four-wheel disc brakes with Lincoln front calipers, red leather Cobra bucket seats, a dash-mounted Smiths tachometer, a MotoLita steering wheel, an exhaust system with cut-outs, and an upgraded clutch, flywheel, drive shaft, rear end, and suspension were also installed. It was offered on BaT in 2016 and then given a Ford France rally-style makeover the following year. BaT co-founder Randy Nonnenberg bought the car in 2022 and further refined it, and it was driven in that year’s Copperstate 1000 as well as to numerous BaT events across California. The Falcon is now offered on dealer consignment with build records, service records, and a clean California title. The car has been done up in the style of a mid-1960s Ford France rally car, with Marchal and Hella driving lamps, a Lucas rear fog light, a Rally Geneve hood decal, an offset blue racing stripe, a replica front French licence plate, and Ecurie Ford France graphics over the Corinthian White paintwork. Dralle Engineering built the brakes and suspension with the following components: Koni shocks front and rear 550lb Progress Technology front springs Dralle/Competition Engineering narrow width rear leaf springs Shelby-style upper control arm relocation Competition Engineering control arm package 1” front sway bar Maier Racing panhard bar Competition Engineering big spindles Heavy-duty tie rods Four-piston Lincoln front brake calipers 11.75” Competition Engineering rotors 10.5” ventilated rear disc brakes Adjustable brake proportioning valve Braided brake lines front and rear Ford 16:1 quick-ratio steering box In preparation for the sale, the chassis was lubricated and the lower right-front ball joint was replaced. The satin black 15″ steelies are mounted over spacers, and the tires are 205/60 BFGoodrich Radial T/As. Dralle Engineering fabricated a GT350-style bolt-in roll bar and custom aluminum package tray for the interior. They also applied Dynamat sound deadening to the floor and trunk before installing black carpeting. The Cobra buckets are covered in red leather to match the factory door panels, and safety enhancements include Crow harnesses and a fire extinguisher. The factory gauge cluster remains in place behind a wood-rim MotoLita steering wheel, while an 8k-rpm Smiths tachometer is mounted in the driver’s eyeline and three Stewart Warner auxiliary gauges are situated beneath the dashboard next to the brake bias adjuster. The five-digit odometer shows 16k miles, though the total mileage is unknown. The 331ci Ford small block was balanced, blueprinted, and built by Jim Dralle using a Mexican 289 block. The engine has a 9.5:1 compression ratio and was built with the following: Dralle-spec roller cam Eagle crankshaft Eagle H-beam connecting rods Mahle forged pistons Doug Thorley headers Two-row aluminum radiator Hand-ported Edelbrock aluminum heads Edelbrock Aluminum Air Gap RPM Performer intake manifold MSD coil and 6AL control unit LCS aluminum flywheel Centerforce clutch Avaid Road Race seven-quart oil pan A custom Falcon export brace allows for the use of a dual master cylinder, the shock towers are reinforced, and a Falcon Monte Carlo bar is fitted. The last oil change was performed by Randy in late 2024 with Valvoline VR1 20W-50 oil. The factory fuel tank has been replaced with a 16-gallon Fuel Safe fuel cell, and the battery was relocated to the trunk. The factory external filler cap remains in the rear taillight panel but the cell is filled inside the trunk. The driveline includes a five-speed Tremec TKO manual transmission, a custom-fabricated driveshaft, and a narrowed Ford 9” rear end with Currie axle shafts and a 3.50 Truetrac limited-slip differential. A Competition Engineering cross member bar supports the engine mounts and lower shock towers and full-length sub-frame connectors are also installed. The exhaust system has bypass valves to choose between the straight side pipes and the muffled rear exits. The car does exhibit a vibration from the rear end at speeds of 85mph and higher, and the driveshaft was rebuilt and balanced in 2024 but that did not improve the vibration. The car is titled by the California assigned VIN 3A17F173315 which matches the stamping on the front inner fender. The riveted driver door option tag was removed at some point in the car’s history, and a stone chip and slight passenger wiper scratch are noted in the windshield.
