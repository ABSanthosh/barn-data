Further equipment includes the Chrono Package, LED headlights with Porsche Dynamic Light System (PDLS), full bucket seats in carbon-fiber reinforced-plastic (CFRP), and a Bose surround sound system. The current owner purchased the car in 2024, and a ceramic coating and XPEL paint protection film were subsequently applied and clear side marker lights were fitted.

The car is powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six paired with a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle. Further equipment includes the Chrono Package, LED headlights with Porsche Dynamic Light System (PDLS), full bucket seats in carbon-fiber reinforced-plastic (CFRP), and a Bose surround sound system. The current owner purchased the car in 2024, and a ceramic coating and XPEL paint protection film were subsequently applied and clear side marker lights were fitted. This 718 Spyder RS now has 479 miles and is offered at no reserve with a copy of the window sticker, the owner’s manual, the removed black Race-Tex seat inserts and marker lights, and a clean Indiana title. The 718 Spyder RS features a vented hood and front fenders as well as additional upper intakes when compared with the contemporary 718 Spyder. Weissach Package-equipped cars are denoted by titanium tailpipes and a Gurney flap on the rear spoiler as well as exposed carbon-fiber weave on the hood, side air intakes, combustion air intakes, third brake light, supplemental safety bars, and side mirror housings. This example is finished in Shark Blue (D5C) and fitted with a black soft top embossed with a “Weissach RS” logo. A ceramic coating and XPEL paint protection film were applied in September 2024. Additional details include LED headlights with Porsche Dynamic Lighting System (PDLS) as well as ParkAssist rear parking sensors, clear side marker lights, integrated dual exhaust outlets that exit through the rear diffuser, and auto-dimming mirrors with an integrated rain sensor. Satin Dark Silver 20″ Forged Magnesium wheels are mounted with 245/35 front and 295/30 rear Dunlop Sport Maxx Race 2 tires. A front-axle lift system was optioned from the factory as were Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) featuring yellow Porsche-branded calipers at all four corners. The carbon-fiber reinforced-plastic full bucket seats are upholstered in black with Blue Studio Check-patterned inserts with memory foam from P1Designs as well as blue extended deviated stitching. Appointments include matte carbon-fiber trim, “Weissach RS” headrest embroidery, a matte black windshield frame, dual-zone automatic climate control, a Bose surround sound system, and PCM infotainment with navigation. The leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline flanked by a 200-mph speedometer and a configurable digital display. The optional Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The odometer indicates 479 miles. The mid-mounted 4.0L flat-six was factory rated at 493 horsepower and 331 lb-ft of torque. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle, and the car is equipped with Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV) and a mechanically locking differential. A copy of the window sticker shows optional equipment and a total price of $219,510. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage. There is currently a lien on the vehicle, and the seller’s lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the next owner. You are not connected to real-time updates.
