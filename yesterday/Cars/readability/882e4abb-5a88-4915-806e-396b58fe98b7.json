  "text": "What appears to be a keepsake ended up little more than one more car at a salvage auction July 17, 2025 at 21:11 by Stephen Rivers Somebody’s rare delivery-mileage Dodge Challenger SRT Demon 170 burned up. Despite heavy damage to the entire exterior of the car it still runs and drives. As of this writing, at least one bidder is willing to pay $70,500 for the charred car. In the world of high-powered muscle cars, few vehicles have caused as much of a stir as the Dodge Challenger SRT Demon 170 did in late 2022 and early 2023. With performance figures that bordered on absurd, it quickly became a must-have for collectors and enthusiasts alike. If cars like the Hellcat and original Demon were wild, the Demon 170 was certifiably insane. Naturally, many were snapped up and tucked away, preserved as prized possessions. At least one owner, though, wasn’t quite so lucky. More: His Overpriced Mustang Went Up In Flames Then Ford Mailed Him A Souvenir The car you see here is at a salvage auction and is going to sell for tens of thousands. That’s impressive considering the extensive fire damage which is visible on every single panel. The rear quarter panels are by far in the best shape of them all, as the paint is at least somewhat visible. The rear tail lights appear intact as well, in contrast to the front ones are nowhere to be seen. The roof and glass all appear to be in fine shape. What’s really shocking is the cabin, though. Many surfaces still have the plastic from the Dodge factory on them. That includes the front seat, the steering wheel, and the gear shift. Based on the limited viewing angles we have, it seems as though the fire didn’t damage the cabin at all. Perhaps most importantly, though, this car runs and ‘drives’ according to the auction house. A photo of the engine compartment shows that it looks almost identical to any other Demon 170 bay. It’s far from perfect, but the flames didn’t do much visible damage at all. As of this writing, the high bid is $70,500, which is around half of what the MSRP would’ve been on this car when it was new. Considering that it has just 16 miles on the odometer, we can see the value in turning this already charred car into a truly mad creation. Maybe we’ll see it pop up on a YouTube channel sooner rather than later.  Credit: AutoBidMaster",
