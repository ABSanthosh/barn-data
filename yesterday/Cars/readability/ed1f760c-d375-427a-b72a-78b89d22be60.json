  "text": "This 2021 McLaren 765LT is #139 of 765 examples produced and was sold new in Canada, where it has remained through the selling dealer’s acquisition in 2024. Finished in MSO Papaya Spark over black Alcantara with McLaren Orange accents, it is powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. The car is equipped with the Black Pack as well as 19″ and 20″ diamond-cut forged alloy wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes, a vehicle-lift system, a titanium quad-exit exhaust system, and an active rear spoiler along with carbon-fiber exterior and interior trim. Inside, heated and power-adjustable bucket seats are accompanied by a Bowers \u0026 Wilkins sound system, McLaren Track Telemetry, and an 8″ touchscreen infotainment system. This 765LT has 27k kilometers (~17k miles) and is now offered in Canada by the selling dealer with the owner’s manual, a battery maintainer, a car cover, and clean Alberta registration. The 765LT “Longtail” is a track-focused variant of the 720S and utilizes a carbon-fiber Monocage II monocoque with an extruded aluminum subframe, revised aerodynamics, and thinner-gauge glass. This example is finished in MSO Papaya Spark with gloss black effects on the front splitter, air intakes, mirror housings, side skirts, and rear diffuser. Paint protection film has been applied to the exterior. Further details include soft-close dihedral doors as well as a LED lighting, carbon-fiber trim, double-glazed engine window, and an active rear spoiler with an air brake and an automatic Drag Reduction System. The headlights were serviced in 2023, and window tint film was removed in preparation for the sale. Diamond-cut 19″ front and 20″ rear forged alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P-Zero tires measuring 245/35 and 305/30, respectively. The double-wishbone independent suspension features McLaren active damping, and the 765LT was equipped with a stiffened steering torsion bar and a quicker rack compared to the 720S. The car is fitted with a vehicle lift system, and stopping power is provided by six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers fitted over carbon-ceramic rotors. The front tires were replaced and the brake fluid was flushed in 2023, while the rear tires were replaced in 2024. The cockpit features heated and power-adjustable sports seats trimmed in black Alcantara with McLaren Orange accents as well as matching stitching that extends throughout the cabin. Additional details include carbon-fiber trim along with a Bowers \u0026 Wilkins sound system, an 8″ touchscreen infotainment system, and dual-zone climate control. The carbon-fiber steering wheel is wrapped in Alcantara and fronts gearshift paddles along with a configurable digital display that folds flat to expose simplified instrumentation including a digital tachometer, gear indicator, and speedometer. The car features a McLaren Track Telemetry system with a lap timer and three cameras, though the selling dealer notes that a “camera system failure” warning message is displayed. The digital odometer indicates 27k kilometers (~17k miles). A plaque affixed to the driver-side door jamb identifies the car as #139 of 765 examples produced. The mid-mounted twin-turbocharged 4.0L M840T V8 features a titanium quad-outlet exhaust system as well as a higher-capacity fuel pump, forged aluminum pistons, and a three-layer head gasket shared with the Senna. Factory-rated output was 755 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque, a 45-horsepower increase over the 720S. The oil was changed in February 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch SSG automatic transaxle. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage. The vehicle is being sold on its Alberta registration, which serves as an ownership document in Canada. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
