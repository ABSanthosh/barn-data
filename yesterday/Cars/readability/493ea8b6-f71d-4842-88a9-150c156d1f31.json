  "text": "Just over a decade ago, Bruno Forcella had the nutty idea to build a chopper with an electric drivetrain. The minimalistic hardtail evoked myriad reactions, ranging from intrigued to downright vexed. But Bruno was undeterred—so he’s just built another electric chopper, with even more features than the last. Based in Switzerland, Bruno is an electrical engineer who builds bikes under the moniker Sine Cycles. Like most artisans, Bruno had a head full of ideas after building his first battery-powered chopper. So he resolved to make this one better in every way, ambitiously nicknaming it ‘King Current.’ Bruno’s first build used a repurposed Cleveland Cyclewerks Heist chassis as its foundation, but he had something more ambitious in mind for King Current. This time, he built the frame from scratch. The design is impossibly elegant, with an exposed backbone that splits at the seat and flows seamlessly into the softail-style swingarm. The cantilevered rear arrangement uses a pair of Progressive Suspension shocks, tucked in under the saddle, but still very much visible. Conventional forks do duty up front, held in place by custom yokes. The lowers feature a clever hidden axle system, which makes for a super sano front end. Contrast cut 21F/18R wheels are wrapped in Metzeler Marathon Ultra rubber, with J.Juan brakes handling stopping duties. The ABS-equipped brakes are from a 2016-model Zero FX, which also donated its electric drivetrain. Its three-phase motor is good for 43.4 hp and 96 Nm of torque, with a top speed of 125 km/h [77.7 mph]. Power is sent to the back wheel via a clutchless belt drive, with pulleys that Bruno designed and fabricated himself. The Zero motor looks good wedged into Bruno’s handmade frame, but it’s the proprietary Sine Cycles battery housing that really ties everything together. An evolution of his previous design, it sports a retro-futuristic design that’s echoed in the handmade heatsink that’s wrapped around the motor. Bruno admits that the battery’s compact size has an effect on the bike’s range, but it’s a compromise he’s willing to make. “The range of 100 km [62 miles] is fine for my personal needs,” he says, “such as commuting to work or going for a smooth ride around the nearby lake, leaving behind stunned people in their cars and on the side of the road.” Perched above the stylish battery enclosure is a pair of handmade fiberglass covers, which hide the controller and other important electronic bits. The gap between the ‘tank’ and battery adds visual lightness to the build, while Bruno’s obsessively neat wiring keeps things uncluttered. A solo saddle sits further back, mounted on a pair of barrel springs to add a touch more comfort. Modified aftermarket fenders sit fore and aft, mounted on custom-made brackets. The cockpit sports a set of LSL handlebars and clamps, fitted with Motogadget grips, push buttons, and bar-end turn signals. The Zero’s digital dash has been repurposed and now sits just behind the bars. The headlight uses a Harley-Davidson lens, retrofitted in an aluminum bucket that echoes the finned details found elsewhere on the bike. The tail end of the bike wears a pair of three-in-one LED taillights, mounted directly to the rear fender, and a side-mounted license plate bracket. The foot controls are a cocktail of aftermarket and custom-made parts. Aiming for simplicity and timeless style, Bruno commissioned a glossy black, grey, and white livery from Fabrizio Passani. Between its flawless lines and tasteful finishes, King Current makes a strong case for a svelte electric chopper. If someone were to put this into production, we’d certainly be tickled.
