  "description": "Mercedes-AMG has confirmed the development of an all-electric super SUV, which will be underpinned by its own AMG.EA platform. The new model will rival the Lotus Eletre, the upcoming Porsche Cayenne electric and the BMW XM hybrid. Will be the second model to sit on AMG.EA architecture Will be a spritiual successor to the AMG GLE 63  Super SUV to be wholly developed by AMG Just as the XM was developed from the ground up by BMW's M division, the new Mercedes is being developed wholly by AMG, rather than being based on an existing model like the EQS SUV. It is expected to arrive in 2026, following the launch of the second-generation Mercedes-AMG GT 4-door coupe – the first car that will use the AMG.EA architecture. The AMG.EA is a development of Mercedes' mainstream MB.EA platform that's been modified to use advanced electric motors from Yasa, an Oxfordshire (UK)-based firm. Its axial-flux units put out up to 480hp, yet weigh just 24kg. The AMG.EA architecture can support a pair of motors on each of its axles, suggesting that the most extreme cars to use this platform could comfortably offer over 1,000hp. The structure will also feature 800V electricals and an AMG-specific battery pack using a silicon anode. The new super SUV will be positioned as a successor to the existing Mercedes-AMG GLE 63. The new Mercedes-AMG super SUV will be a larger and more luxurious proposition. AMG insiders have previously told our sister publication Autocar UK that it's size is similar to the low-slung Vision AMG concept shown in 2022, at around 5.1m long, with a wheelbase of more than 3.0m.
