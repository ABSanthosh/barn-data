  "description": "This 2007 Porsche 911 Turbo coupe was modified under prior ownership with a TechArt GTstreet body kit, exhaust system, VarioPlus coilovers, and powerkit for its twin-turbocharged 3.6L flat-six along with 20\" HRE wheels, Fabspeed headers, and a rearview camera. Finished in Carrara White over black leather, the car is further equipped with all-wheel drive, a six-speed manual gearbox, the Sport Chrono package, and bi-xenon headlights as well as a sunroof, a Kenwood touchscreen infotainment unit, heated adaptive front seats, carbon-fiber trim, and automatic climate control. The car was acquired in 2020 by the selling dealer, who reports changing the engine oil and transmission fluid in preparation for the sale along with replacing two TPMS sensors and dry-ice blasting the underside of the car. Said to have been displayed at the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) show, this 997.1 Turbo coupe has 37k miles and is now offered at no reserve in Texas with a window sticker, owner's manuals, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Arizona title.",

Finished in Carrara White over black leather, the car is further equipped with all-wheel drive, a six-speed manual gearbox, the Sport Chrono package, and bi-xenon headlights as well as a sunroof, a Kenwood touchscreen infotainment unit, heated adaptive front seats, carbon-fiber trim, and automatic climate control.

Said to have been displayed at the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) show, this 997.1 Turbo coupe has 37k miles and is now offered at no reserve in Texas with a window sticker, owner’s manuals, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Arizona title. The car is finished in Carrara White (B9A) and was fitted in 2007 with a TechArt GTstreet body kit comprised of front and rear spoilers, side skirts, wider vented fenders, and bumper covers. Exterior details include a power sunroof, bi-xenon headlights, fog lights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, tinted rear windows, and a Rydeen rearview camera. A crack in the front lip is shown in the gallery below. Black-finished 20″ HRE wheels are mounted with 245/30 front and 325/25 rear Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires that have 2016 production-date codes. Red-finished Brembo brake calipers have been fitted along with ventilated and slotted rotors. The suspension has been modified with TechArt VarioPlus coilovers and a nose-lift system. Two of the TPMS sensors were reportedly replaced in September 2024. The heated and power-adjustable Adaptive Sport front seats are upholstered in black leather that extends to the dashboard, door panels, and folding rear seats. The center console is finished in white and red, and additional appointments include automatic climate control, carbon-fiber trim, driver-seat position memory, Guards Red seat belts, a TechArt short shifter and pedals, Porsche headrest crests, and cruise control as well as an aftermarket audio system with a Kenwood touchscreen receiver and JL Audio amplifiers and speakers. The TechArt Sport steering wheel frames a central tachometer and a 225-mph speedometer as well as gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The optional Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 37k miles, approximately 3k of which were added under current ownership. The twin-turbocharged and intercooled 3.6-liter Mezger flat-six was fitted with a TechArt Powerkit in 2007, with additional tuning taking place in 2016. A DME report and dynamometer readings can be viewed in the gallery. Preparation for the sale is said to have included changing the engine oil and gearbox fluid as well as dry-ice blasting the underside of the car. Power is sent to all four wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle. A TechArt GTstreet valved exhaust system has been fitted, as have Fabspeed headers. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Jackie Cooper Imports in Tulsa, Oklahoma, factory colors and equipment, and a total price of $129,925.
