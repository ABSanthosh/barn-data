  "description": "This 1968 Lamborghini Islero is the 104th of 125 first-series examples built during a single year of production and was completed in November 1968. Chassis 6318 is said to have been delivered new via Milanese dealer Auto Elite to its first owner in the Como region of Italy and remained in the country until being imported to the UK in 1975. After undergoing a color change to red and an overhaul of the 3.9-liter quad-cam V12 in the 1980s, the car was brought to the US in 1984 by a Delaware owner who retained it for 16 years. It was later repainted in Argento before undergoing a refurbishment in California between 2011 and 2012 that included rebuilds of the six Weber carburetors and work on the brake and suspension systems. After being updated with power steering under subsequent ownership in 2018, the car was purchased by its current owner in 2021. Additional features include a five-speed manual transmission, servo-assisted disc brakes, four-wheel independent suspension with coilover shock absorbers, 15” cast-magnesium wheels, brown leather interior upholstery, and a cassette stereo. This Islero is now offered on dealer consignment in Dripping Springs, Texas, with a clean Montana title.",

Chassis 6318 is said to have been delivered new via Milanese dealer Auto Elite to its first owner in the Como region of Italy and remained in the country until being imported to the UK in 1975. After undergoing a color change to red and an overhaul of the 3.9-liter quad-cam V12 in the 1980s, the car was brought to the US in 1984 by a Delaware owner who retained it for 16 years. It was later repainted in Argento before undergoing a refurbishment in California between 2011 and 2012 that included rebuilds of the six Weber carburetors and work on the brake and suspension systems. After being updated with power steering under subsequent ownership in 2018, the car was purchased by its current owner in 2021. Additional features include a five-speed manual transmission, servo-assisted disc brakes, four-wheel independent suspension with coilover shock absorbers, 15” cast-magnesium wheels, brown leather interior upholstery, and a cassette stereo. This Islero is now offered on dealer consignment in Dripping Springs, Texas, with a clean Montana title. Introduced at the 1968 Geneva Auto Show, the Islero shared much of its underpinnings with its predecessor, the 400 GT, including a shorter, lighter version of the 400 GT’s 2,550mm-wheelbase tubular chassis and the V12 engine also utilized in the Miura. The Islero’s bodywork featured panels provided by Carrozzeria Bertone with assembly handled by Carrozzeria Marazzi. Named after a Spanish fighting bull, the Islero was produced in two versions, with the revised S variant entering production in 1969. This first-series example is said to have been repainted prior to the 2011-2012 refurbishment in silver, which was reportedly its original color. Design features include pop-up headlights, high-mounted bumpers, grille-mounted Hella fog lights, a driver-side mirror, a fender-mounted antenna, and quad exhaust outlets. The Islero model’s Campagnolo cast-magnesium wheels were shared with the Miura and are secured by three-eared knock-offs. This example’s wheels are finished in silver and are wrapped in 205/70R15 Vredestein Sprint Classic tires, as is a matching spare housed in the trunk. A refresh of the four-wheel disc brakes during the 2011-2012 refurbishment is said to have included replacement of the dual vacuum servos and master cylinder as well as rebuilds of the calipers. Power steering was added in 2018. The cabin is trimmed in brown leather over 2+2 seating with matching upholstery over the door panels and center tunnel. Additional features include tan carpeting, black dash trim, lap belts, power windows, and a cassette radio with an integrated equalizer. The two-spoke wood-rimmed steering wheel sits ahead of Jaeger instrumentation including a 300-km/h speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and gauges monitoring oil temperature, coolant temperature, oil pressure, amperage, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 19k kilometers (~12k miles), approximately 1k of which have been added under current ownership. The 3,929cc 60° V12 features an aluminum block, aluminum cylinder heads with dual overhead camshafts on each bank, six Weber 40 DCOE carburetors, and twin distributors. Output was factory rated at 320 horsepower. The engine is said to have been overhauled in the 1980s, while work during the 2011-2012 refurbishment included rebuilds of the cylinder heads, carburetors, and water pump as well as a re-core of the radiator. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale. Shifting is via a Lamborghini-built five-speed manual gearbox with synchromesh on all gears. Independent suspension incorporates double wishbones, coilover shock absorbers, and anti-roll bars at front and rear. The suspension is said to have been overhauled during the 2011-2012 refurbishment, which also included replacement of the clutch cylinders. You are not connected to real-time updates.
