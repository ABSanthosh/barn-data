But now I have my chance.Do you trust your dealerships service department? I am curious about this not only as a car enthusiast and industry observer but also as a former service grunt myself. I was a porter, a greeter, and a service writer. Even though I haven't drawn a paycheck from a dealer group since 2007, I still feel a little bit connected to the job. In fact, I still have some ideas for \" Tales From the Service Desk\".Anyway, the perception or stereotype is that consumers often don't trust mechanics/technicians, and when they do, it's usually a local owner of an independent shop. Until I read our post, I was under the impression that both dealerships and large chains were considered untrustworthy. So, anyway, it's your turn. Sound off below. Do you trust the folks at the local dealership when it comes time for service? Why or why not?Is that trust limited to basic maintenance and/or warranty work?And so on and so forth.

More by Tim Healey Published March 18th, 2025 6:00 PM Comments Join the conversation Having owned Jeeps, no, I wouldn't trust a dealer service dept. I had a service manager sit and listen to a noisy throwout bearing in the Jeep and he claimed it was completely noise free. I recorded the whole thing and sent it to the Jeep consumer affairs. They made the dealer fix the throwout bearing under warranty. Then I sold the Jeep and bought a 4Runner. I still don't go to the Toyota dealer for any service. The service techs aren't paid to diagnose problems, so, they don't. No. Definitely no. I brought truck in for new rear brakes at 50,000 km(30,000 miles) expecting warranty coverage. Nope. Not happening. To make matters worse, they did not have rotors. Blamed a local parts supplier for that. They turned rotors, put on new pads and expected me to come back for new pads and rotors. I was at said parts supplier next day. My son is buddies with a few staff. They checked system and told me they never had parts for my truck, let alone any Colorado. They said that dealership had Blamed them for stuff like this in the past.I have several other examples. Too often dealer techs rely on TSBs and vehicle specific diagnostic tools to do the heavy lifting of diagnosing a problem. Unfortunately manufacturers require adherence to these procedures in order to be reimbursed for the repairs. I trust that eventually the dealer service department will fix the problem….after a try or two.Outside of warranty work I use an independent shop that I trust.",
