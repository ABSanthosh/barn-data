  "text": "Published:  March 24th, 2025 Stellantis clearly did itself a major disservice by discontinuing its iconic line of V8 engines. But there have been endless rumors, and even public speculation from upper management, that the company wanted to correct that mistake and restore some goodwill with ardent Mopar fans. The latest of these are reports that the Dundee Engine Plant in Michigan will be retooled to manufacture the entire HEMI V8 family by August. Originally developed when the Chrysler legacy brands were still being operated under the purview of Daimler-Benz, the HEMI motors saw continued improvements under Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA). This changed following the FCA-PSA Group merger that formed Stellantis. New leadership had expressed a desire to electrify the former Chrysler brands and didn’t see large-displacement as viable due to increasingly strict emission regulations. Sadly, the resulting products haven’t been popular with fans of the relevant brands and even created a sort of spiritual crisis for some of them — particularly Dodge, which had become famous for offering big vehicles with giant engines producing large amounts of power at competitive prices. Numerous models that were previously sold with V8 motors, were now coming with Stellantis's new 3.0-liter twin-turbo “Hurricane” inline-six engine or a battery driven alternative while also seeing a not-so modest increase in price. While the Hurricane is an excellent powerplant, it admittedly feels out of place in certain models where you’d expect to have a V8 higher on the trim ladder.Fans predictably became upset and Stellantis has been doing what it can to fix the issue. CEO Carlos Tavares announced his departure from the company late in 2024. At roughly the same time, Tim Kuniskis was re-hired to oversee the Ram truck brand and provide peace of mind to the Americans that someone was on board as knowing what they wanted. Rumors that the HEMI V8, which Kuniskis had a major hand in, could return were spurred by the management shakeup. Allegations have also been thrown around that there is a major schism in Stellantis’ leadership regarding the future direction of its many brands.It now seems assured that more V8s will be on offer for Ram models, with the assumption being that Dodge will eventually try and find a way to fit them into the redesigned Charger. According to Mopar Insiders, the Dundee Engine Plant is allegedly being set up to build, not only the 5.7-liter V8, but also the 6.4-liter (392 cubic-inch) “Apache” HEMI V8 and the supercharged 6.2-liter HEMI V8 that went into Hellcat models. From Mopar Insiders:Previously, Stellantis produced the HEMI V8 family at its Saltillo North Engine Plant in Saltillo, Mexico. That production ended in favor of the new twin-turbocharged HURRICANE I6 engines. Many believed that once existing engine stocks ran out, the HEMI V8 was finished for good.However, following the departure of former CEO Carlos Tavares and shifting political influences, Stellantis seems to have reversed its plans. Recent leaks, as well as our many sources, have suggested that Stellantis eagerly wants the HEMI V8 back in its portfolio.Sources have indicated that the returning HEMI V8 engines will remain based on the proven Gen 3 architecture. While most aspects will carry over, there could be notable updates or enhancements once they arrive. Additionally, a new larger-displacement HEMI variant could join the lineup in the future.While vehicular news doesn’t get much better than that, one does worry that Stellantis could attempt to keep these powertrains locked behind increasingly expensive trims. Having to pay more for a larger engine makes sense. However, one of the biggest draws for American automobiles has historically been the fact that you can acquire large-displacement motors at a price other regions couldn’t hope to match. Customers have likewise been signaling that the new-vehicle market is on the outer limits in terms of affordability, so truly lofty MSRPs could be a big risk — even when you’re offering equipment drivers clearly want. Dundee presently builds the 2.4-liter “Tigershark” I4 and 3.6 “Pentastar” V6 engines. As of now, Stellantis has not officially confirmed anything about the future of the facility. But the rumors are extremely plausible and the factory is close enough so that your author can keep tabs. We expect Stellantis to make a formal statement about the facility in the coming weeks.
