  "description": "This 2014 McLaren P1 is #47 of 375 examples produced and was delivered new to McLaren Newport Beach in Costa Mesa, California. It was subsequently registered in Montana, Pennsylvania, and Indiana before being sold on BaT in February 2022. It was acquired by the selling dealer in Canada in 2025 and now has 1,900 miles. The car features carbon-fiber bodywork finished in Azure Blue over gray leather upholstery, and power comes from a mid-mounted, twin-turbocharged 3.8L V8 and a single electric motor that drives the rear wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. Features include carbon-ceramic brakes, electro-hydraulic rack-and-pinion steering, a 4.7-kWh lithium-ion battery pack, active aerodynamics, an extendable rear wing, carbon-fiber racing seats, dual-zone climate control, navigation, and a Meridian sound system. This P1 is now offered by the selling dealer with factory books, a clean Carfax report, and an Ohio title.",

It was subsequently registered in Montana, Pennsylvania, and Indiana before being sold on BaT in February 2022. It was acquired by the selling dealer in Canada in 2025 and now has 1,900 miles. The car features carbon-fiber bodywork finished in Azure Blue over gray leather upholstery, and power comes from a mid-mounted, twin-turbocharged 3.8L V8 and a single electric motor that drives the rear wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. Features include carbon-ceramic brakes, electro-hydraulic rack-and-pinion steering, a 4.7-kWh lithium-ion battery pack, active aerodynamics, an extendable rear wing, carbon-fiber racing seats, dual-zone climate control, navigation, and a Meridian sound system. This P1 is now offered by the selling dealer with factory books, a clean Carfax report, and an Ohio title. The Frank Stephenson-designed P1 debuted at the 2012 Paris Motor Show. The production car was produced from October 2013 to December 2015, with approximately 127 examples designated for the US market. The P1 is built on McLaren’s MonoCage carbon-fiber monocoque platform with an extruded aluminum rear subframe. It carries a dry weight of approximately 3,075 pounds. This example is finished in Azure Blue with gloss carbon-fiber coves and mirror caps, and features include LED lighting, dihedral doors, active aerodynamics, a roof-mounted air intake, an extendable rear wing, and a center-exit Inconel exhaust system. Replacement headlights were installed by McLaren Philadelphia in July 2021. The 19″ and 20″ aluminum-alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires. The suspension features double wishbones at all four corners as well as variable ride height and spring rates that can be adjusted by the driver via various driving modes. Electro-hydraulic rack-and-pinion steering is also featured while stopping power is provided by Akebono-McLaren six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors. The suspension accumulators were recharged and fresh brake fluid was added in July 2021. The cockpit features carbon-fiber racing seats trimmed in Slate Grey leather with Stone Grey inserts and Midnight Blue contrast stitching. Slate Grey leather extends to the dashboard, and exposed carbon fiber is visible throughout. Amenities include dual-zone climate control, navigation, a Meridian sound system, and racing harness provisions. A 4.7-kWh lithium-ion battery pack is mounted behind the cockpit. The computer system motherboard was replaced in July 2021. The leather-wrapped steering wheel houses buttons for the car’s Instant Power Assist and Drag Reduction systems, the former of which applies all available electrical power in the drivetrain and the latter retains the auto-deploying rear wing in its retracted position. A configurable digital display is mounted forward of the driver, and the odometer shows 1,900 miles. A plaque listing the car as #47 is mounted on the driver’s door sill. The twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter V8 is paired with a McLaren E-Motor mounted on the rear axle for a combined output of 903 horsepower, 664 lb-ft of torque, and an electrically limited top speed of 217 miles per hour. A replacement electric hybrid water pump was installed in July 2021 along with fresh fluids. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and an open differential with Brake Steer functionality. New output shaft seals and a driveline damper were installed in July 2021. The Carfax report lists no accidents or other damage. The Ohio title is listed as a replacement.
