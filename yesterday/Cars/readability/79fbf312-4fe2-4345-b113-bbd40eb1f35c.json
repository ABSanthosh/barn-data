  "description": "It promises unrivalled off-road performance with on-road niceties. But does it deliver? The talismanic strategic status of the reimagined Land Rover Defender has been obvious since we first saw one back in 2019. The funny thing is, this car’s commercial significance has rapidly become even greater. JLR sold more Defenders in 2023 than all of its Velars, Evoques and Discovery Sports combined. In the UK, it has sold more and more units every full calendar year since its introduction. So it’s a vital profit generator (given it can easily be dressed up to cost close to £100,000 in just-so specification), and suddenly an asset that the company simply can’t afford to let go off the boil.Hence this 2025-model-year update. It’s not quite a facelift, because very few if any exterior design changes are entailed. It’s more about lifting the Defender’s luxury cabin ambience to meet slightly more bourgeois appetites (still no hose-out interior, then. Gah, etc).But, cabin revisions aside, there's a new engine in the range; with the new range-topping Defender Octa about to launch to the market.The new Defender is available in 90, 110 and extra-long 130 forms, the 90 only emerging into showrooms early in 2021 and the 130 in 2022. The engine range, which was only four options strong at launch, has expanded to encompass six motors in all, although some are only on offer in models with starting prices above £80,000.The meat of that engine range is now comprised of two six-cylinder, 3.0-litre diesel options (D250 \u0026 D350) which offer between 247- and 345bhp, as well as a four-cylinder petrol-electric P300e plug-in hybrid (which adds in an electric drive motors to help out that same four-pot petrol turbo engine, and to boost real-world running efficiency and fleet running credentials).If you're shopping at the pricier end of the showroom spectrum, P425 and P500 V8 options are available, both sitting underneath that new 626bhp V8 Octa.The Land Rover Defender line-up at a glanceThe Defender's model grade structure is now simpler than it was. The cheapest S models start at under £60,000, and the line-up extends up from there through X-Dynamic SE and -HSE, X and V8 specifications. Commercial-grade Defender Hard Top models, which come without rear seats and with boosted load-carrying space, are still available also. Lower-grade cars come on fixed-height steel coil suspension as standard, with height-adjustable air suspension optional, and typically packaging with Land Rover's latest Terrain Response offroad traction and stability control aids and adaptive damping.On interior layout, there's lots of flexibility on offer. A pair of manually deployable third-row seats are available as an option on 110 models; a middle-set front-row 'jump seat' is offered on some derivatives (though not, critically, where it would effectively turn the Defender into a nine-seater minibus); and extra cabin configurability has been added to the extra-long 130 version, to which we'll come shortly.",

  "text": "It feels like Land Rover has aimed for an interior that straddles both luxury and utility. No easy task, but it has pretty well nailed it. That there are exposed sections of body colour and star-head bolts, a big broad slab of dashboard with grab handles and a dinky instrument binnacle all evoke the original Defender, but that wouldn’t recognise the material quality and the fit and finish of its construction.There are fewer obviously plush surfaces than you’ll find in a Range Rover or Land Rover Discovery, or the most luxurious among its SUV competition (say, an Audi Q7 or Volvo XC90), but material choices lift it above a Jeep Wrangler, even a Toyota Land Cruiser, and it feels airy and spacious instead of basic.As well it might. At 2105mm across the mirrors, this is a wide car, with a cabin spacious enough, if you spec it, for a middle jump seat between the two regular front chairs. They’re as broad and welcoming as it isn’t; but for kids or short hops, it’d do a job – although we imagine it’ll spend most of its time folded flat, where it creates a broad centre console.The driving position is upright and accommodating, the steering wheel huge and visibility fantastic. You can see to the extremes of the bonnet, and big windows and large door mirrors make side visibility strong, although rear vision is hindered mildly by the tailgate.Rear passengers get as good a deal as the driver, with big seats and masses of head and leg room. Behind them is a boot with a narrower opening than top-hinged rivals, but there’s plenty of space in there, and you can specify two seats in it, too, although we haven’t had a chance to sit in them.With the 2025 model year update, meanwhile, new heated and cooled seats with winged headrests (for rows one and two) have come in on upper-tier models, or as a ‘signature’ option on lower tier ones. The palette of interior trim materials has been made broader and richer. And, if you buy a supersize Defender 130, you can now get individual ‘captain’s chairs’ in row two granting step-through access to the three-seater third-row; which families with younger kids should appreciate.Land Rover Defender infotainment and sat-navWhen Land Rover tells you it has created a new-generation infotainment system, you’d be forgiven for being concerned. This is a company whose entertainment, information and communications systems have routinely not just been second best to almost everyone else’s but also more prone to bugs and the whole ‘turn it off and on again’ routine. However, for the first time, we’re able to tell you that the Defender's Pivi Pro system really, honestly, is as good as anyone’s.The climate controls remain as physical dials (praise be) and frequently used systems can be accessed via haptic-feedback, variable-function steering wheel buttons. The rest are accessed via a touchscreen that responds quickly and is laid out sensibly. Or it will mirror your phone and do what you need that way.",
