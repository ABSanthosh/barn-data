  "text": "Slow sales have reportedly doomed the entry-level Charger Daytona 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier A new report suggests Dodge will kill the entry-level Charger Daytona R/T for 2026. The Charger Daytona Scat Pack would survive and could potentially get a price cut. More notably, we can expect a four-door variant and a twin-turbo engine. Dodge has found itself in a bit of a pickle with the Charger Daytona, and let’s just say, the ‘brotherhood of muscle’ isn’t exactly embracing the EV revolution. In fact, it seems like their idea of “muscle” is still firmly rooted in gas-powered engines, leaving expensive electric coupes to languish on dealership lots, forcing huge markdowns. A quick search online reveals a $61,590 Charger Daytona R/T listed for a mere $34,184 in Florida. Over in Texas, Richardson Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram has their $61,590 Charger Daytona R/T priced at $39,055. More: Dodge Desperate To Sell Charger Daytona EVs, Prays Huge Discounts Will Lure Buyers While those are just two examples, it’s clear the Charger Daytona was an answer to a question no one asked. Dodge might finally be acknowledging that as a new report suggests the entry-level R/T variant will be killed off for 2026. We’ve reached out to Dodge for a comment and are still waiting for a response (as of this writing), but Mopar Insiders is reporting that the R/T was originally going to be an “order-only” model for 2026. However, given the dismal reception, Dodge is apparently preparing to pull the plug on it entirely. Scat Pack and New Models The Charger Daytona Scat Pack is rumored to survive and it’s notable for featuring a dual-motor all-wheel drive system with 630 hp (470 kW / 639 PS) and 627 lb-ft (849 Nm) of torque. That’s considerably more than the R/T’s 456 hp (340 kW / 462 PS) and 404 lb-ft (547 Nm). While the 2025 Charger Daytona Scat Pack starts at $68,195 before a $1,995 destination fee, the 2026 model is reportedly getting a price cut. There’s no word on how much, but it appears to be dropping equipment and perks including the previously standard Track Pack. Aside from the rumored elimination of the Daytona R/T, a four-door model is set to join the lineup in 2026. It will be accompanied by the previously announced twin-turbo 3.0-liter Hurricane inline-six. The publication also says the 2026 Charger lineup will gain a new wheel design as well as a stripe package that was previewed at Springfest.",
