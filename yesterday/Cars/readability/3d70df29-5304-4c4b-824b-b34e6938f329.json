  "text": "This 1975 Honda TL125 was acquired by the seller in 2022, from the reported previous owner of 26 years, and was subsequently restored under current ownership. It is powered by a 122cc SOHC four-stroke single paired with a five-speed transmission and is finished in silver with orange, yellow, and black graphics. Equipment includes a kick starter, a Keihin carburetor, a high-mounted exhaust system, drum brakes, wire-spoke wheels, and a black vinyl solo seat. This TL125 is offered in Connecticut for off-road use only on a bill of sale. The frame was stripped to bare metal and was refinished under current ownership in black. The 1.2 gallon fuel tank, side covers, and fenders were refinished in silver with orange, yellow, and black graphics. Details include a front mudflap, a skid plate, a black vinyl solo seat, spring-loaded serrated foot pegs, and a side stand. Silver-finished alloy rims measuring 21″ up front and 18″ out back were relaced with replacement spokes under current ownership. IRC knobby tires are mounted, and suspension consists of a conventional telescopic fork and dual preload-adjustable chrome shocks mounted to the swingarm. Braking is handled by a drum at each end. Blemishes are visible on the finish of the wheels. The chrome-finished handlebar carries levers for the clutch and front brake as well as a twist-grip throttle and an ignition cut-off switch on the right. The TL125 did not come with an odometer or other instrumentation, therefore total mileage is unknown. The 122cc SOHC four-stroke single was factory rated at 8hp and features a kick starter, flywheel magneto ignition, and a black-finished tucked exhaust system with a perforated heat shield. Work under current ownership included replacing the spark plug and ignition points as well as adjusting the timing chain tension, valve clearances, and ignition timing. Power is delivered to the rear wheel through a five-speed transmission and a drive chain with a black guard. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
