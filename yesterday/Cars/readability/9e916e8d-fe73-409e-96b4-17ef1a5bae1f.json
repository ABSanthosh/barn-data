Features include the Ambient Light Package, 23″ Taigete alloy wheels, a panoramic sunroof, adaptive LED headlights, ceramic-composite disc brakes, adaptive cruise control, a Bang \u0026 Olufsen Advanced 3D sound system, heated and ventilated power-adjustable front seats, rear-axle steering, and automatic climate control. This Urus is now offered by the selling dealer with a window sticker, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New York title. The Urus features mixed aluminum, steel, and composite construction, and this example is finished in Rosso Efesto. The truck is equipped with a panoramic sunroof, adaptive LED headlights, a rear spoiler, front and rear parking sensors, and quad exhaust outlets. The 23″ Taigete alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires. Braking is handled by carbon-ceramic rotors with black-finished calipers, and the factory air suspension incorporates active damping and electromechanical roll stabilization. The Nero Ade interior has heated and ventilated power-adjustable front seats and heated rear seats, which are upholstered in white. Additional features include the Ambient Light Package, adaptive cruise control, a Bang \u0026 Olufsen Advanced 3D sound system, and automatic climate control. The flat-bottom steering wheel is wrapped in leather, and it frames a configurable TFT instrument panel. The digital odometer indicates 18k miles. The twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 was factory rated at 641 horsepower and 627 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed and the spark plugs were replaced in May 2024. Power is sent to all four wheels through an eight-speed ZF 8HP automatic transaxle and a Torsen center differential.
