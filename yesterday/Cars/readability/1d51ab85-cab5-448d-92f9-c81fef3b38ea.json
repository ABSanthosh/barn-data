  "text": "I recently had the privilege of visiting Schubert Motorsport’s headquarters in Oschersleben, Germany, just as the team returned from their victorious 2024 DTM (Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters) season. Schubert Motorsport had clinched the team title for the second time since 2022, and their 7,500 m² state-of-the-art facility located next to Motorsport Arena Oschersleben serves as the hub of their operation. Under the leadership of team principal Torsten Schubert, a former European autocross champion, the team arrived fresh off the season finale at Hockenheimring, where René Rast secured a third-place finish in the #33 BMW M4 GT3. That podium spot sealed the team championship for Schubert Motorsport, capping off an impressive season in which drivers Rast, Sheldon van der Linde, and Marco Wittmann notched four wins and three additional podiums. Stepping into the facility, I was immediately immersed in Schubert Motorsport’s rich history and achievements. Founded in 1999, the team quickly became a dominant force in German motorsport, first in touring cars and endurance racing. The team has forged a unique partnership with BMW, becoming a factory-supported customer team in 2012. The showroom was a treasure trove of past victories, lined with trophies and racing memorabilia that tell the story of the team’s racing legacy. Among the machines on display was the iconic Need for Speed-sponsored BMW Z4, a fan favorite with special significance in the Speedhunters community, and a car with sentimental and historical importance to Torsten Schubert. Accompanied by Gints Metra, Schubert Motorsport’s public relations representative, I was taken behind closed doors into restricted areas, where three BMW M4 GT3s were being prepped for the next chapter of their racing life. The cars carried the scars of their last race – dirt, scratches, and dents, all proof of their hard-fought battles on track. Gints kindly offered a closer look at the cars, even removing some panels to reveal their inner workings. While I couldn’t dive too deeply with my camera to avoid revealing any setup secrets, it was impossible not to admire the impressive P58 inline-six with M TwinPower Turbo technology — an engine capable of producing up to 590hp. Marco Wittmann’s cockpit left an impression as well. It’s hard to fathom how drivers can operate the complex array of buttons on the steering wheel – or even glance at the tiny track map sticker marked with turn numbers – while keeping their focus on the track. On the passenger side, I noticed equipment used exclusively by DTM race organizers to track the cars and monitor crucial race data. In the workshop, I also met Daniel Schreiner, a carbon fiber specialist who works on both fabricating new parts and repairing damaged ones. “We try not to waste anything,” he explained. “Most damaged body panels find a second life during track tests or practice sessions.” Reflecting on the 2024 season, Torsten Schubert shared his thoughts: “It is very nice for the entire team that at the end of this season with highs and lows, we can celebrate a title win.” After 16 races, Schubert Motorsport accumulated 361 points, securing the team championship with a 35-point margin over their nearest rivals. Rast’s season included two victories and multiple podium finishes. Sheldon van der Linde and Marco Wittmann also proved to be fierce competitors in one of the most demanding fields in motorsport. Looking ahead, the future is bright for Schubert Motorsport. As they continue to refine their GT3 race cars, their partnership with BMW remains a key to success. “We have a close relationship with BMW since it’s a semi-supported racing cooperation,” explained Florian Rinkes, Schubert Motorsport’s technical manager and Rast’s race engineer. “We’re constantly giving feedback on car performance, and BMW is responding with updates that make our cars even better. They’re preparing an Evo kit for the GT3 and GT4 cars based on input from all the teams, which will boost the car’s drivability and performance.”  In addition to their DTM efforts, Schubert Motorsport plans to compete in the GT Masters series. They could potentially enter the Nürburgring 24 Hours, too, depending on scheduling. “The 2024 Evo update will be exciting,” Rinkes added, hinting at how the advancements could enhance the team’s capabilities across multiple race series. Visiting Schubert Motorsport was an inspiring glimpse into the inner workings of a championship-winning team. Now that the 2024 title has been secured, the team is already focused on new challenges. With BMW’s ongoing support, Schubert Motorsport is poised for continued success. Vladimir Ljadov Instagram: wheelsbywovka because@wheelsbywovka.com www.wheelsbywovka.com",
