Sure, most of the B\u0026B are well-versed in such matters but it doesn’t hurt to reinforce some of yer long-held beliefs – or start an argument in the comments. Let’s start this month’s tire recommendations with some standard observations about why winter rubber is a good idea. Long gone are the days when these things were called ‘snow tires’ and featured enormous tread lug patterns which created apocalyptic levels of road noise and reduced handling properties to that of driving on cheddar cheese. Modern winter tires from companies like Sailun have advanced rubber technology that enhances traction when ambient temperatures drop below 7C/45F instead of only when a layer of snow covers the driving surface.Generally, the effectiveness of a winter tire is determined by its molecular (rubber compound) and mechanical (tread pattern) properties. The former is a closely guarded witch’s brew not easily discerned while the latter is defined by the tire’s tread pattern and can effortlessly viewed by anyone blessed with the gift of sight. Both attributes work together to provide traction when temps drop and snow starts to fly. Promoted Product: Sailun Ice Blazer WSTX Anyone who lives in the more northern areas has to deal with the inevitability of winter and the driving conditions it creates. Many folks drive trucks and SUVs, partially because they often can handle snowy roads better than some cars, but much of that depends upon the tires and driving conditions. Truck and SUV drivers have a choice when it comes to picking a snow-worthy tire. You can go with an all-terrain-type tire that is snow rated, or you can pick up a true snow tire. The route you want to go is dependent on what type of driving you do, and the conditions you drive in. For average driving, if you want a tire that you can run year round, an all-terrain might be a great choice. However, if you need a serious tire for snow conditions, it makes sense to get snow tires specifically for your vehicle, like the Sailun Ice Blazer WSTX. What makes these tires a great choice for serious winter driving is the amount of grip you get on snow and ice. They are 3 Peak Mountain SnowFlake (3PMSF) rated, which means the tires are made with a special rubber compound that stays pliable in colder conditions (at or below 40º F), giving the tire better grip on snow and ice-covered roads. Going with a tire like the WSTX gives you the best option for traction on slick roads. The siping and tread pattern flexes and gives grip when other tires fail.Sailun USA – https://gosailun.com/en-us/plt/tires/wstx/Sailun Canada - https://sailuntire.ca/en/plt/tires/wstx/ And, yes Virginia, you should install winter tires on a truck or SUV even if it is all- or four-wheel drive. While sending power to all corners certainly helps with acceleration, braking and cornering benefit immensely from the extra traction afforded by winter rubber. This helps explain why tow truck drivers in snow belt states can be kept busy hauling these types of vehicles shod with all-season tires out of ditches once the snow starts to fly.What to choose, then? The extra mass and size of these brutes has prompted tire companies to make products specifically engineered for use on pickup trucks and SUVs. By constructing the tire’s sidewalls out of sterner materials such as aramid, which is a very strong chemical compound commonly referred to as Kevlar. As an aside, Kevlar is actually a brand name belonging to DuPont but most folks use it generically – like a lot of us say Kleenex, Jacuzzi, or Zamboni whilst referring tissues, hot tubs, or ice resurfacing machines. Aramid fibers are part of the puzzle creating a sidewall compound which is exceptionally durable and resistant to punctures. It strengthens the area to withstand external impacts and pressing against the wheel flange, such as when you slam into that deep pothole which appeared out of nowhere. Barring that impromptu etymology lesson on Kevlar, a more traditional indicator of a tire’s stoutness can be found stamped right in the sizing indicating its intent for use on a light truck or passenger vehicle. Hoops starting with an ‘LT’ designation generally have a heavier construction, more plies (the number of so-called layers in the rubber), and tougher compounds. Put simply, tires starting with a ‘P’ may not be as robust while ‘LT’ tires may give up some ride quality thanks to stiffer sidewalls, though strides in research and development have closed this gap significantly. There are many instances in which the same size can be found in both LT and P types: LT275/65R18 versus P275/65R18, for example. This common sizing can even happen with the same tire, with socks such as the new Sailun Ice Blazer WST2 being available in those very dimensions in both LT and P specification. The most difference between the LT and P variants of that tire in equal sizes is their total tread depth; the LT tire has an extra 3/32nd of an inch worth of usable tread than the P tire. Does this mean it will last longer? Perhaps – but LTs are generally a skiff costlier at time of purchase, so this revelation isn’t necessarily the financial hack it first seems. Also, as a studdable winter tire (we’ve covered the pros and cons of studs in a separate article), LT variants of the Sailun Ice Blazer WST2 take a slightly larger metal stud than its P cousin. Whatever style of winter tire you select, always be sure to look for the three-peak mountain snowflake, a symbol which confirms the tire has passed a certain set of performance standards for use in winter conditions. This is contrary to the ubiquitous ‘M+S’ stamp which is only a harbinger of tread pattern geometry which checked a bunch of boxes but makes no guarantee of performance capabilities. Such advice applies to both LT and P tires.Stay safe on the roads this winter, folks.[Main Image: Ultraskrip/Shutterstock.com. Product image: Manufacturer]Become a TTAC insider.
