  "description": "Honda has launched an updated version of its Activa 125 scooter which is now compatible with the upcoming OBD2B norms and it also gets a new TFT display. 4.2-inch TFT display is new USB-C charging port now included Only top 2 variants launched for now The current Activa 125 uses a LCD display while the new one now offers a 4.2-inch TFT. This display is also compatible with Honda’s RoadSync app which enables functions like call alerts and navigation assists. The scooter also comes with a USB type C charging port. In addition to meeting the updated OBD2B specifications which come into effect in 2025, the Honda Activa 125 is otherwise mostly the same under the skin. This includes the 123.9cc fuel injected engine that produces 8.4hp and 10.5Nm of torque. The motor is equipped with a start-stop system. The 2025 Honda Activa is available in 6 colours and prices now start at Rs 94,442 for the DLX variant while the top H-Smart variant with the key fob and keyless ignition costs Rs 97,146. That is a steep climb from the Activa 125’s current starting price of Rs 80,256 and some of it will be down to the more expensive emissions monitoring tech. However, Honda has only launched two variants for now and more affordable versions with simpler features like a front drum brake may be launched in the future which will reduce the entry point.   The only other family-oriented 125cc scooter to get a TFT is the top SmartXonnect variant of the TVS Jupiter 125, which costs Rs 90,721.  All prices ex-showroom, Delhi Also See: Honda Activa 125 BS6 review, test ride",
