  "description": "This 1959 Lancia Appia GTE Zagato was distributed new through Max Hoffman in New York before being purchased by the former owner, Anatoly Arutunoff, in the early 1970s and driven in the inaugural Copperstate 1000, the Mitty, the Monterey Historics, and other events across the US. Chassis 2533 was sold by Mr. Arutunoff on BaT in September 2021 and brought to Canada, where it was acquired by the seller in 2023. Subsequent work involved re-trimming the seats in leather along with performing an engine tune-up, fitting a custom exhaust system, and dry ice cleaning the underside. The car features aluminum Zagato bodywork finished in white over a white and blue interior and is powered by a 1.1-liter V4 fitted with a single Weber carburetor and a four-into-one header. Shifting is through a four-speed manual transmission, and further details include covered headlights, a sliding-pillar front suspension, and 15\" steel wheels along with a wood-rimmed Nardi steering wheel and Veglia instrumentation. Previously listed on BaT in November 2024, this Appia GTE Zagato is offered again in Canada with a FIVA identity card, catalogs and vehicle literature, records dating back to the 1970s, spare and removed parts, and Alberta registration in the seller's name.",

Shifting is through a four-speed manual transmission, and further details include covered headlights, a sliding-pillar front suspension, and 15″ steel wheels along with a wood-rimmed Nardi steering wheel and Veglia instrumentation. Previously listed on BaT in November 2024, this Appia GTE Zagato is offered again in Canada with a FIVA identity card, catalogs and vehicle literature, records dating back to the 1970s, spare and removed parts, and Alberta registration in the seller’s name. A successor to the Ardea, the Appia debuted at the 1953 Turin Motor Show and mimicked the appearance of the Aurelia. In addition to the four-door berlina, Lancia offered a Vignale-bodied convertible, a Pinin Farina 2+2 coupe, and a Zagato-bodied GT. This example of the latter features aluminum bodywork with early-style covered headlights and is finished in white. The nose and trunk lid wear Appia GTE badging, while Zagato logos adorn the fenders. A bullet-style mirror has been added to the driver’s door, and the previously applied event decals have been removed. The seller notes evidence of prior paintwork as well as scratches in the windshield and cracking paint. The 15″ steel wheels feature Lancia-branded hubcaps and are wrapped in older Michelin tires. The car features a sliding-pillar independent front suspension arrangement with coil springs, while a solid axle and leaf springs are fitted out back. Stopping power is provided by hydraulic drum brakes at all four corners. The cabin houses low-back bucket seats that have been re-trimmed in white leather with blue piping, while the floors are lined with replacement blue carpets. The previously installed roll bar, driver’s harness, and under-dash VDO gauges have been removed. The wood-rimmed Nardi steering wheel frames Veglia instrumentation consisting of a central 5,500-rpm tachometer flanked by a 100-mph speedometer and a combination gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 33k miles, less than 500 of which were added by the seller. The 1.1-liter V4 is equipped with a single Weber carburetor along with an aftermarket four-into-one exhaust header. The engine was rebuilt under previous ownership in 1974, and a tune-up was performed following the seller’s acquisition in 2023. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a floor-shifted four-speed manual transmission. The underside was dry ice cleaned and a replacement exhaust system was installed under current ownership. Catalogs and other literature are included in the sale along with a FIVA identity card, records dating back to the 1970s, tools, and a collection of spare and removed parts that can be viewed in the gallery. The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its Alberta registration, which serves as the ownership document in Alberta, Canada. The document carries an “Antique Vehicle” notation and lists the car as a 1960 example. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
