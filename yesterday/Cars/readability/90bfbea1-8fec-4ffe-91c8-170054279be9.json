This GT40 replica was acquired by the selling dealer in 2025 and is now offered at no reserve in Newport Beach, California with spare steering wheels and a clean California title, listing the car as a SPCNS with no model year. The fiberglass body is finished in a Gulf-style livery with light blue paint accented by an orange front bumper and body-length stripe. Exterior equipment includes fog lights, painted roundels, body-color side mirrors, dual exposed fuel filler caps, a driver-side Gurney bubble, plexiglass side windows with pop-out vents, side air intakes, and a Kamm tail. Staggered-width 15″ wheels feature orange centers with polished rims and three-eared knock-off hubs, and they are mounted with Avon tires. The suspension is equipped with adjustable coilovers, and stopping power is provided by disc brakes with black GT40-branded Wilwood calipers. The cockpit features fixed-back racing seats trimmed in black upholstery with ventilation grommets and Willans harnesses. Additional features include air conditioning, a center console-mounted shifter, and 12-volt power sockets. The MOMO steering wheel is mounted on a quick-release NRG hub and sits ahead of Smiths instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline, a 200-mph speedometer, and auxiliary gauges. The digital odometer indicates 876 miles. The 427ci Roush V8 features a Dart block, AFR aluminum cylinder heads, eight-stack individual throttle body electronic fuel injection, “bundle of snakes” exhaust headers, and Roush-branded valve covers. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a ZF five-speed manual transaxle. The California BAR sticker lists SB100 status and describes the vehicle as a 2018 SPCNS GT40.
