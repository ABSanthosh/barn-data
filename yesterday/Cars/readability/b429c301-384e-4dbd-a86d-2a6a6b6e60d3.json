Verdict Not like the M5s of old but works well as entertaining tech showcase GoodEpic paceV8Uses all the tricks in the book to feel agile, and succeeds to a large degreeBadEpic size and weightUltimately not as intuitive as the best supersaloonsInterior is a downgrade from the previous generation DESIGN \u0026 STYLING Pros Available as a saloon or estateM additions hit the spotAll the tech Cons Enormous, and enormously heavyAll the tech The headline stuff is that the M5 now weighs 2435kg before you climb aboard. That figure rises to two and a half tonnes if you choose the Touring (for only the third time in the M5’s history, an estate is now an option). Either way, it’s enough to give even 717bhp something to think about. Indeed, the new M5 is slightly slower to 62mph than the previous-gen car (3.5sec versus 3.4). Does that matter? To some it will, but the super-saloon arms race needs to end somewhere, and this seems as good a point as any.What matters to M is not only the pure performance but also the experience, and to that end, the M5 retains the 4.4-litre V8 with two twin-scroll turbos from the previous generation, albeit with a range of detail improvements. It now makes 577bhp all by itself.The hybrid part – the 18.6kWh battery and 194bhp electric motor – is actually the same as you’ll find in the fleet-favourite BMW 530e. R\u0026D chief Dirk Häcker says bespoke high-performance batteries are in the works for future models, but for now this is the best solution. There was no temptation to go with a smaller AMG-style battery, because all 5 Series share the same body and structure, which has a compartment under the floor for the battery. As such, using a smaller unit would just be a waste of space. Anyway, the low centre of gravity that comes with having a battery pack in the floor has allowed M to back off the suspension stiffness a touch compared with the previous-generation M5 Competition. It still doesn’t believe in air suspension, but the M5’s steel coils are now progressive, giving the adaptive dampers (which are now made by Bilstein instead of long-time partner Sachs) more room to work. The M5 naturally gets plenty of bespoke hardware and geometry that you wouldn’t find in a normal 5 Series.M’s disinterest in air springs does not mean it has made some sort of back-to-basics M5; far from it. Instead, Garching has thrown the full gamut of chassis tech at the G90. There’s variable-ratio steering and four-wheel steering (the rear wheels can turn up to 1.5deg), the traction and stability control systems are even more advanced than before and the fully variable four-wheel drive that can switch to rear-wheel drive makes a return. Data shows that vanishingly few owners ever use it, but it’s the usual principle of the diver’s watch: what matters is not whether owners use it, but rather the knowledge that the capability is there.This new M5 certainly isn’t back to basics in how it looks. The current 5 Series is a slightly awkward-looking thing, with a tall scuttle and belt line to hide the thick battery pack under the floor, a droopy bottom and rather fussy detailing. But underestimate an injection of M-steroids at your peril. M design is all about stance, and to that end, the new M5 has 75mm wider front wings and, for the first time in an M5, wider rear wings (by 48mm). They house double-staggered (20in at the front, 21in at the back) wheels. INTERIOR Pros Excellent sports seats and driving positionM5 has more buttons than the standard 5 Series Cons Interior represents a downgrade in quality and usability from previous generationThis enormous car has a surprising lack of rear leg room Get in and you’re treated to a classically pedigree driving position and typically outstanding sports seats. You can't sit quite as touring-car low as in the previous M5, because you are sitting on top of the battery pack, but you're not exactly perched. And anyway, the ultra-low seating position you get in BMWs is quite a recent thing – the E60 5 Series was more upright.Most of the surroundings are the same as that of any new 5 Series, though. That is to say not as high-quality or measured, let alone easy to use, as the previous generation. Although the big curved screen isn't short visual pizzazz, much of the remaining switchgear has clearly been downgraded.M division must agree that some settings shouldn't require a menu trawl, because the centre console has gained a couple more buttons that give you direct access to the driving-mode configuration, the hybrid modes, the M modes and the stability control.The new 5 Series, whether M5 or 520i, is also surprisingly tight in the back for leg room, and while the boot floor isn't as high as in plug-in hybrid Mercedes models, the luggage space is weirdly narrow. ENGINES \u0026 PERFORMANCE Pros Mighty in-gear performance and responseV8 still sounds like a V8Gearbox works well Cons No faster to 62mph than the previous generationLevel of performance borders on the unusableYes, the previous two points are contradictory – that's the modern supersaloon For the first time in an M5, pressing the start button elicits not an engine firing up but a friendly bong to tell you the drive system is ready. When you put it in Drive and squeeze the accelerator, the car moves off on electric power because that’s the default setting. The ability to glide noiselessly through town and complete uninteresting journeys on electric power is certainly an asset, but part of the appeal of a car with a special engine is to make those journeys a bit more interesting. There is something odd about having a super-saloon that feels a bit wheezy until the engine kicks in.It’s solved easily by changing into the Dynamic hybrid mode, which keeps the engine on all the time and makes sure the battery never runs out, but then you start to wonder why you’re carting 150kg of battery around.Configured as such, it becomes plain exactly what the electrification is contributing: it’s not so much standing starts as it is unreal mid-range punch: any gear, any revs, any speed and this M5 goes. This gives you options: you can leave the gearbox in fifth and surf on a burbling wave of torque, or gear down and rev the engine to 7200rpm, letting it do its best E92 M3 V8 impression in the process. It doesn’t matter much for cross-country pace, so you can explore the engine’s different characters. I’m sure some of the sound is digitally augmented, but not obviously so: it sounded good to me.It is the sort of performance that feels great on an autobahn, but it might feel a bit like setting up a Marshall stack in your living room when introduced to the UK’s more pedestrian speed limits. This M5 reaches high speeds with ridiculous ease and feels rock-solid doing so. RIDE \u0026 HANDLING Pros Lots of gripVarious systems conjure surprising – and entertaining – agilityQuite refined Cons Very big on the roadSteering lacks feedback, sapping confidence It’s surprisingly comfortable, too. The suspension is firm, sure, but really well damped, not harsh and supremely controlled, to the point where I tended to leave the dampers in their stiffest mode. When road test ed Matt Saunders drove a Touring prototype in the UK, he found it coped well with bumpy Welsh roads, too, so the M5s new-found compliance ought to translate. Which isn’t to say the M5 has become a laid-back cruiser: all that chassis tech gives it plenty of tools to entertain, up to a point. To no-one’s surprise, the adaptive suspension ensures tight body control, while the 285- and 295-section tyres generate enormous grip. Select 4WD Sport and the halfway-house M Dynamic stability control modes, and all the systems work together to rotate the M5 neatly out of turns and inject an accessible and non-perilous sense of humour into what could be a very serious car. On a good road you can get into a nice flow, and the 2.5 tonnes melt away. Almost. Push beyond that, though, and it can start to feel a little like uncharted territory. The steering doesn’t give much feedback, and I never felt sure whether I was going to get brutal traction, a gentle slide or a spike of oversteer. That’s probably when driving harder than most owners will tend to do, and I’m sure that on a track, in two-wheel drive mode, the M5 will still make a wonderful smoke machine. MPG \u0026 RUNNING COSTS Pros Cheaper than most other hybrid super-saloonsLow company car tax band Cons Still thirsty when pushed The M5 saloon starts from £111,405 and the M5 Touring estate costs £2000 more. That's pricier than the Mercedes-AMG E53 (which isn't quite a full-fat AMG) but far cheaper than the Porsche Panamera Turbo E-Hybrid or AMG GT 63 S E Performance 4-Door Coupé. In electric mode, the M5 squeezes up to 42 miles out of its 18.6kWh battery, which is quite a bit less than the 530e (which uses the same battery) on account of the wider, stickier tyres. Still, that means it falls into the 8% BIK tax bracket, inconceivably making this 717bhp V8 super-saloon quite an appealing company car for a few high-earning executives. Fuel economy, as will all PHEVs, will be entirely dependent on how much pure-electric driving you do. Get the electric and petrol motors working hard in tandem, though, and economy won't be any better than in the old M5. VERDICT Verdict Not like the M5s of old but works well as entertaining tech showcase GoodEpic paceV8Uses all the tricks in the book to feel agile, and succeeds to a large degreeBadEpic size and weightUltimately not as intuitive as the best supersaloonsInterior is a downgrade from the previous generation The M5 is a car that needs to be understood in context, then. And if you’re hoping this new one will serve up remotely similar sensations to the E28 M5, forget it: the Toyota GR86 is closer. What it does is reinterpret the super-saloon for 2024. The PHEV drivetrain means that it can continue to be sold around the world while also giving it a usability boost and electric (literally) throttle response. Meanwhile, the chassis tech manages to disguise the weight pretty well and even add to the dynamic character. There's still room to fine-tune some of these devillishly complicated systems, but on the evidence of this drive, the G90 is still a proper M5.

Instead, Garching has thrown the full gamut of chassis tech at the G90. There’s variable-ratio steering and four-wheel steering (the rear wheels can turn up to 1.5deg), the traction and stability control systems are even more advanced than before and the fully variable four-wheel drive that can switch to rear-wheel drive makes a return. Data shows that vanishingly few owners ever use it, but it’s the usual principle of the diver’s watch: what matters is not whether owners use it, but rather the knowledge that the capability is there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis new M5 certainly isn’t back to basics in how it looks. The current 5 Series is a slightly awkward-looking thing, with a tall scuttle and belt line to hide the thick battery pack under the floor, a droopy bottom and rather fussy detailing. But underestimate an injection of M-steroids at your peril. M design is all about stance, and to that end, the new M5 has 75mm wider front wings and, for the first time in an M5, wider rear wings (by 48mm). They house double-staggered (20in at the front, 21in at the back) wheels.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n  \n\n  \n\u003cdiv data-id=\"interior\" id=\"chapter-interior\"\u003e\n                                        \u003cdiv\u003e\n  \n      \n  \n  \u003cp id=\"price_rating\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eINTERIOR\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePros\u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eExcellent sports seats and driving position\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eM5 has more buttons than the standard 5 Series\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCons\u003c/span\u003e\n      \u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterior represents a downgrade in quality and usability from previous generation\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis enormous car has a surprising lack of rear leg room\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eGet in and you’re treated to a classically pedigree driving position and typically outstanding sports seats.

When you put it in Drive and squeeze the accelerator, the car moves off on electric power because that’s the default setting. The ability to glide noiselessly through town and complete uninteresting journeys on electric power is certainly an asset, but part of the appeal of a car with a special engine is to make those journeys a bit more interesting. There is something odd about having a super-saloon that feels a bit wheezy until the engine kicks in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s solved easily by changing into the Dynamic hybrid mode, which keeps the engine on all the time and makes sure the battery never runs out, but then you start to wonder why you’re carting 150kg of battery around.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eConfigured as such, it becomes plain exactly what the electrification is contributing: it’s not so much standing starts as it is unreal mid-range punch: any gear, any revs, any speed and this M5 goes.

The suspension is firm, sure, but really well damped, not harsh and supremely controlled, to the point where I tended to leave the dampers in their stiffest mode.
