  "text": "A disclaimer: this week’s Weird and Wonderful is heavy on racing vehicles. We don’t mind if you don’t. In fact, we’re positively delighted to showcase the vehicles below, as they represent the most unique, impressive, and interesting vehicles we have featured on BaT this week! As we always note, this is by no means a comprehensive list and there are certainly many more odd and beautiful vehicles to be seen on the live auctions page. Here are some of the listings that stood out to us this week. 1. 1967 Ford GT40 G7A Mark IV Conversion If you haven’t heard of the Le Mans-winning Ford GT Mark IV, we’d like to take this opportunity to welcome you out from beneath your rock. But if you hadn’t heard of the J-car-based G7A, you’re in good company. This very special car is chassis J-10, one of twelve built by Kar Kraft that were destined to receive Mark IV bodywork for endurance racing. Before that could happen, the FIA outlawed the big 427ci V8s for the 1968 season, and the chassis was sold to privateers  Charles and Kerry Agapiou and repurposed for Can-Am racing as the “G7A,” pictured below. Despite its impressive pedigree and the best efforts of drivers like Peter Revson, Jack Brabham, George Follmer, David Hobbs, Vic Elford, Lee Roy Yarbrough, and John Cannon, the G7A wasn’t competitive and finished only one race before it was crashed. The next owner chose to re-body the car as the Mark IV GT that it was always intended to be, and though the bodywork isn’t original, it remains one of the ~9 remaining J-cars in existence today. 2. 1984 Argo JM16 GTP When we think IMSA GTP cars, our mind goes straight to Jaguars, Nissans, and Porsches, but a number of successful privateer teams procured their own chassis and drivetrains in the first few years of the GT Prototype class. Case in point is this Argo JM16—a chassis designed by Lotus and McLaren alum Jo Marquart, which was outfitted with a naturally-aspirated Buick V6 and raced (with some success) by Oklahoma businessman Charles Morgan and his co-driver Bill Alsup in the GTP and smaller-displacement Lights classes. Several JM16 cars competed in IMSA in 1984 and ’85, powered by Mazda, Buick, and Cosworth engines, and this example currently runs a normally-aspirated 4.47-liter Buick OHV V6. The combination of a big torquey drivetrain and slippery aerodynamics seems like the simplest way to go very, very fast, and we admire those of you out there who might have the racing chops necessary to drive something like this in anger. The rest of us can just look at pictures like this and imagine. 3. Team Ducati Pikes Peak 2010 Ducati Multistrada 1200S We’re pushing on with another vehicle that has serious racing history—a 2010 Ducati Multistrada 1200S that ran Pikes Peak with the factory team between 2010-2012. The mountain road was paved in 2011, thus, this was one of the last bikes to complete the course when there were still dirt sections. It’s also one of just a handful of motorcycles to complete the course in under 10 minutes, which it accomplished at the hands of Greg Tracy in 2012. Ducati has included a Pikes Peak Special Edition in its lineup since 2011, though the motorcycle class was officially disbanded after the 2019 death of Carlin Dunne, who set records with the Ducati team on a similar bike. 4. LS3-Powered Sidewinder Buggy OK, one more racing vehicle. We’ve transitioned from paved course to mixed-surface mountain road, and now we’re headed for the desert. Most racing vehicles are sold with the caveat that they are “for off-road use only,” but few mean it as much as this 575-horsepower Sidewinder dune buggy. This long-legged rig has 10 years of racing history with the current husband-and-wife owners, and if you’re interested and local, it looks like there are a number of circuit and stage races in the American southwest that are frequented by amateur competitors. 5. 1910 Sears Model H Motor Buggy We love a convenient segue, so this next feature is also a buggy, albeit one of a more primitive sort. The Model H Motor Buggy is an air-cooled, mid-engine two-seater, which might sounds sporty if you hadn’t gotten a look at it. Sears, Roebuck \u0026 Co. were quick to capitalize on the new horseless carriage trend, and stood up a factory in Chicago making their very own automobile back in 1909, which they sold via mail-order for the princely sum of $395. Frankly, we’re impressed that this 116-year-old automobile still runs, drives, and stops, and we can’t get enough of the driving video. Amazingly, this isn’t the first Sears Motor Buggy we’ve listed. The last one was a restored example that came out of the IMS Museum collection, and sold for a cool $20k in 2020. 6. 1979 Ferrari 308 GTS from Magnum P.I. For readers of a certain vintage, there’s a decent chance that this particular Ferrari 308 was the one that made you fall in love with the model. It also may have prompted you or your father to grow a luxurious ‘stache and don shorts that were too small. The show never made us want to own a 308, though. If anything, it demonstrated that it’s far better to borrow one from the absentee owner of a vast Hawaiian estate in exchange for private security services. Honestly, we have been hoping for years that one of the Magnum cars would show up here. We’ll celebrate by getting the theme song stuck in your heads for the next 2-3 days, at least. 7. 2011 General Dynamics M1161 ITV-LSV Growler The M1161 Growler’s “ITV-LSV” acronym describes its role—Internally Transportable Light Strike Vehicle. This stripped-down jeep-ish buggy was designed to be transported inside of a V-22 Osprey and deliver small teams of US Marines in a light utility or fast attack role. In certain battlefield scenarios, the lack of armor was a liability, but that shouldn’t be a problem for you unless your local deer population has upgraded their arsenal. 8. RUF RCT Evo-Specification 1991 Porsche 911 Carrera Coupe 5-Speed We know, we know—the Porsche 911 gets enough love around here, but this isn’t just any Porsche 911. Well, it was for many years, but in 2023 it was sent to RUF Automobile in Victoria, British Columbia, and became the first of a limited-run of Canadian-built RCT Evos. RUFCanada is in the comments adding color to the details of the build, and we love that the owner opted for the full suite of RUF goodies while keeping the 964 Carrera’s narrow bodywork. 9. 1932 Packard Light Eight Model 900 Sedan Project A poverty-spec Packard seems like an oxymoron, but 1932 was close to the nadir of the Great Depression, and even the upper classes were feeling the squeeze. The shovelnose Light Eight Model 900 was a one-year model, and was Packard’s attempt at an “entry-level” car, with more basic features that shaved a whopping 400 lbs. off of the more luxurious Standard Eight. It sold well in 1932, though by autumn of that year, sales for the entire lineup had fallen off a cliff, and didn’t start to recover until the introduction of the One-Twenty in 1935. 10. 1981 Volkswagen Dasher Diesel Wagon 4-Speed This unassuming brown diesel VW wagon has a humble appearance that belies its pedigree. From the late 1970s until 1983, “Dasher” was the original US-market name for the VW Passat, which was based on the up-market Audi 80. The B1 Passat/Dasher was even designed by Giugiaro, though the styling was squared off a bit with the B2 facelift that first appeared in 1981. This example was kept by one family until 2023, and just traded hands for a very reasonable sum. Honorable Mentions As always, we were unable to contain the full list to just 10 auctions, so here are a few more that we couldn’t bring ourselves to leave out. Honorable Mention: 351ci Cleveland V8 Holman-Moody Intake Patterns This is the second Holman-Moody intake pattern that TheGTShop has brought us, and this piece is said to be for a prototype Indy car engine being developed by Semon “Bunkie” Knudsen and Smokey Yunick. If you’re having fantasies about sand casting unobtanium speed parts in your garage, this listing is for you. Honorable Mention: 51-Years-Family-Owned 1969 Ford Cobra SportsRoof 428 Super Cobra Jet Ford had the rights to the “Cobra” name after Shelby stopped making their Cobra in 1967. Slapping the name onto a big mass-produced fastback seemed like a travesty, but the 428 SCJ-powered version of the Torino was pretty cool regardless. This particular car was raced by its long-term owner, bearing the name “Hisss and Hers” on its doors. Honorable Mention: 2007 Donzi 38 ZR Twin Viper V10 engines manufactured for marine use by Ilmor Engineering (the same Ilmor that made IndyCar engines for Chevy). That’s all you need to know. That’s all we’ve got for this week, but we’d love to hear what caught your eye! Let us know in the comments.",

It’s also one of just a handful of motorcycles to complete the course in under 10 minutes, which it accomplished at the hands of Greg Tracy in 2012. Ducati has included a Pikes Peak Special Edition in its lineup since 2011, though the motorcycle class was officially disbanded after the 2019 death of Carlin Dunne, who set records with the Ducati team on a similar bike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://bringatrailer.com/listing/sidewinder-buggy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e4.

pedigree. From the late 1970s until 1983, “Dasher” was the original US-market name for the VW Passat, which was based on the up-market Audi 80. The B1 Passat/Dasher was even designed by Giugiaro, though the styling was squared off a bit with the B2 facelift that first appeared in 1981. This example was kept by one family until 2023, and just traded hands for a very reasonable sum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHonorable Mentions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always, we were unable to contain the full list to just 10 auctions, so here are a few more that we couldn’t bring ourselves to leave out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://bringatrailer.com/listing/intake-patterns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eHonorable Mention: 351ci Cleveland V8 Holman-Moody Intake Patterns\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_5173-08409-scaled-1-89399.webp?resize=620%2C827\" alt=\"This Week\u0026#39;s Weird and Wonderful: February 28, 2025\" width=\"620\" height=\"827\" srcset=\"https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_5173-08409-scaled-1-89399.webp?resize=620%2C827?w=1536 1536w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_5173-08409-scaled-1-89399.webp?resize=620%2C827?w=225 225w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_5173-08409-scaled-1-89399.webp?resize=620%2C827?w=768 768w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_5173-08409-scaled-1-89399.webp?resize=620%2C827?w=465 465w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_5173-08409-scaled-1-89399.webp?resize=620%2C827?w=1152 1152w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_5173-08409-scaled-1-89399.webp?resize=620%2C827?w=460 460w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_5173-08409-scaled-1-89399.webp?resize=620%2C827?w=144 144w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_5173-08409-scaled-1-89399.webp?resize=620%2C827?w=620 620w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_5173-08409-scaled-1-89399.webp?resize=620%2C827?w=940 940w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_5173-08409-scaled-1-89399.webp?resize=620%2C827?w=1240 1240w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the second Holman-Moody intake pattern that \u003ca href=\"https://bringatrailer.com/member/thegtshop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eTheGTShop\u003c/a\u003e has brought us, and this piece is said to be for a prototype Indy car engine being developed by Semon “Bunkie” Knudsen and Smokey Yunick.
