  "description": "The Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, which is currently on sale in international markets, has been updated with a 48V mild-hybrid system. Toyota claims that due to the mild-hybrid electric vehicle (MHEV) system, the Prado’s diesel powertrain benefits from smoother performance. All Land Cruiser models in Europe will adopt the MHEV system, the Japanese carmaker confirmed. The Land Cruiser Prado is run by a 204hp, 2.8-litre turbo-diesel engine Its mild-hybrid system’s 48V battery is charged via engine braking  Toyota Land Cruiser Prado mild hybrid powertrain Same diesel engine as the Fortuner SUV The Prado SUV’s existing 204hp/ 500Nm, 2.8-litre four-cylinder turbo-diesel engine mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox now gets assistance from the 48V mild hybrid system. This 7.6kg hybrid setup comprises an electric motor-generator (instead of the conventional alternator), a 48V 4.3Ah lithium-ion battery and a DC-DC power converter. All of these work together to enable auto start-stop for enhanced fuel efficiency and provide an additional 16hp and 65Nm at start-off. To charge the small battery, the motor recuperates energy under engine braking. The Toyota Fortuner in India, which is powered by the same diesel engine, recently got Toyota’s mild-hybrid system as well. Toyota Land Cruiser Prado mild hybrid off-road performance 700mm wading depth unaffected by MHEV system \"The system in no way compromises the Land Cruiser [Prado’s] ability to operate in extreme conditions and rough terrain,\" Toyota said. It also ensured that the Land Cruiser Prado’s 700mm wading capacity is unaffected by the new motor-generator, which is mounted high on the engine block and is waterproofed. \"On rougher, off-road surfaces, the motor-generator adds to its ability to tackle obstacles...The operating status is indicated in the driver’s multi-information display with a read-out showing CHG (energy regeneration), ECO or PWR (providing assist in both cases),\" the Japanese carmaker stated further. An earlier report from us had revealed that Toyota would launch the Prado (or LC 250) in India later this year. However, a specific timeline is still unclear. If introduced here, it will slot below the Land Cruiser (or LC 300). Also see: Toyota Land Cruiser Prado spied in India 457hp Toyota Land Cruiser 300 hybrid is most powerful LC ever",
