Equipment includes cross-drilled disc brakes, 19″ multi-piece alloy wheels, Scuderia fender shields, power-adjustable Daytona-style seats, automatic climate control, a Pioneer head unit, a Rockford Fosgate amplifier, and Fiammenghi Italia mufflers. The car was previously listed on BaT in January 2018 and sold on BaT in November 2021 before it was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024. This 575M Maranello has 45k miles and is offered at no reserve in Texas with a clean Carfax report and a clean North Carolina title. The Pininfarina-designed aluminum bodywork is finished in Rosso Corsa, and exterior details include xenon headlights, a hood scoop, a front spoiler, front fender vents, and Scuderia Ferrari fender shields. Blemishes in the finish are shown in the gallery below. Staggered-width 19″ multi-piece alloy wheels were mounted with 255/35 front and 305/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires and installed since the previous auction. The 575M featured a Skyhook suspension system with adaptive dampers, and braking is handled by red Ferrari-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors at all four corners. The power-adjustable Daytona-style seats are upholstered in Beige Tradizione leather and accompanied by a color-coordinated lower dashboard, door panels, and carpeting. Appointments include automatic climate control, electric windows, a Pioneer head unit, a Rockford Fosgate amplifier, and rear luggage straps. There are scuffs on the left door panel. The leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts column-mounted shift paddles and a central tachometer with a 7,600-rpm redline flanked by a 220-mph speedometer and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 45k miles, approximately 200 of which were added by the selling dealer. The 5.7-liter quad-cam F133E V12 features 48 valves, dry-sump lubrication, and Bosch Motronic engine management for a factory-rated output of 508 horsepower and 434 lb-ft of torque. The selling dealer reports that the timing belt was replaced in 2017. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed F1 sequential transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Fiammenghi Italia mufflers with electric bypass valves and quadruple polished outlets exiting through the rear bumper cover have been added since the previous auction.
