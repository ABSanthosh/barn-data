  "description": "The successor to the Ferrari LaFerrari hypercar has been revealed. Called the Ferrari F80, it is the Italian marque’s most powerful road car to date with a 1,200hp hybrid V6 powertrain that combines technology from the company’s Le Mans-winning 499P, along with that of its Formula 1 cars. Interestingly, Ferrari has taken the wraps off its new hypercar just weeks after McLaren revealed the W1. The F80 is priced from GBP 3 million (about Rs 33 lakh) and will have a limited run of just 799 units, all of which have already been sold.  Ferrari F80 powered by 900hp V6 and three electric motors Claimed 0-100kph and 0-200kph times quicker than McLaren W1 Aero generates up to 1,000kg of downforce at 250kph Ferrari F80: powertrain The F80 gets a new version of Ferrari’s 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 engine.  It can rev to 9,200rpm and has been completely overhauled when compared to the unit that powers the 296 GTB. Parts from the 499P Le Mans car have been added to make it produce 900hp, making it the most powerful engine Maranello has yet produced. Ferrari claims the unit is no heavier than the 296’s engine. Working in combination with the V6 engine are three electric motors, two on the front axle and one on the rear. That these motors are made in-house is a first for Ferrari. The front motors make 142hp each, while the rear motor takes the form of an ‘MGU-K’ energy recovery unit. The latter is similar in design to what’s seen in Ferrari’s F1 cars and can recover as much as 95hp through braking to automatically fill power gaps. Another first for the F80 is that it is the first Ferrari to feature ‘E-turbos’, which uses F1 derived tech to to reduce lag and enhance throttle response.  Together, the hybrid system sends 1,200hp to all four wheels. The company claims 0-100kph and 0-200kph times of 2.15 seconds and 5.75 seconds, respectively, which makes the F80 quicker than the McLaren W1 and the Mercedes-AMG One. While different modes – Hybrid, Performance and Qualify – that are selectable via a switch on the steering wheel offer differing levels of power, there is no pure-electric mode. Like the 296, the F80 is not a plug-in hybrid and its 2.3kWh battery is used to boost power, run the car for short durations in low-speed settings. The Performance and Qualify modes provide access to a Boost Optimisation function, which records the track during a sighting lap and then delivers power boosts when needed on the next round.  Ferrari F80: aerodynamics Ferrari’s chief product development boss, Gianmaria Fulgenzi, explained to our sister publication  Autocar UK that the underbody of the new F80 is heavily inspired by the brand’s F1 car, with large barge boards used to channel air below. At the front, the aggressively styled nose is dominated by a huge ‘S-Duct’, which takes inspiration from the 499P and moves air over the cabin and towards the rear. The black fascia across the nose, which is similar to that of the new 12Cilindri, features a small lip at the top edge to channel air over the top of the cabin to the rear wing. The active rear wing adjusts not only its height, but also its angle to optimise downforce and minimise drag. With help from a huge rear diffuser, the rear of the car is able to create up to 590kg of downforce. In total, the F80 generates up to 1,000kg of downforce at 250kph, which puts it on par with the McLaren W1, and just short of an F1 car, which generates some 1,200kg at the same speed. Ferrari F80: chassis At 4,840mm long, 2,060mm wide and 1,130mm tall, the F80 is slightly larger than the W1. It is also 125kg heavier, weighing in at 1,525kg (dry). However, the mix of lightweight materials (carbon fibre, titanium and aluminium) used in its construction make it 60kg lighter than the LaFerrari and have a chassis that is 50 percent stiffer. The cell and roof are made from carbonfibre, with the front and rear subframes made from aluminium. Ferrari has also used the front subframe for heat management purposes, with the hollow structure used as cooling ducts for the brakes. The F80’s active suspension is powered by four 48V actuators. 3D printing is used to create parts of the double-wishbone setup.  Ferrari F80: interior, exterior design While the influence of Ferraris from the past is visible with nods to the F40, Enzo and classic 330 P3, designer Flavio Manzoni said that the design is “absolutely new” and avoids “anything nostalgic”. He cited spaceships and sci-fi as the inspiration for the car’s look. The cabin has an asymmetrical layout that gives the driver priority, though there were discussions about making the F80 a single-seater. Most controls and functions on the new ovoid steering wheel and the slim centre console are physical, which Ferrari says are easy to use while driving.
