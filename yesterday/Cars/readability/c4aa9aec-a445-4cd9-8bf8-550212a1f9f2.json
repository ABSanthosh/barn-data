  "text": "An improperly secured connector could prevent the curtain airbags from deploying in a crash in 26 Voyagers and Pacificas October 31, 2024 at 20:33 by Brad Anderson Chrysler’s latest recall impacts Pacifica and Voyager minivans due to improperly secured airbag connectors. This defect could prevent airbags from deploying during crashes, violating Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Owners will receive recall notifications by November 7, 2024, to secure their vehicle’s CAB connector. In April, Chrysler issued two separate recalls for the Pacifica and Voyager. The first was related to windshields that could pop out in a crash while the second was for the traction control. Fast forward to October and another recall has been issued for the two minivans, this time due to an defect with the curtain airbags. The automaker revealed that certain 2020-2023 Voyager and 2020-2023 Pacifica models may have been assembled with curtain airbag connectors that aren’t properly secured. This flaw could prevent the airbags from deploying in a crash, putting these vehicles in violation of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Read: Chrysler Launches Yet Another Recall For Pacifica Hybrid, Which Could Catch Fire If there’s one piece of good news for Chrysler, it’s the fact the issue isn’t widespread. In fact, just three examples of the Voyager produced between August 20, 2020, and January 9, 2023, are included, while 23 Pacificas built from September 22, 2020, and May 11, 2023, are involved. Of course, the fact the recall isn’t widespread will be no solace to the owners of Voyager and Pacifica models that are faulty. Chrysler’s recall notice reveals that between November 2020 and September 2023, 10 Pacific and Voyager vehicles were found at dealers to have been installed with a disconnected CAB connector. They were repaired before being sold. Chrysler continued to monitor the issue and identified 16 additional warranty claims, indicating it could have a more widespread fault on its hands. Throughout much of 2024, Chrysler has received warranty data, field records, and customer assistance records and on October 17, decided that it would issue a voluntary safety recall. Owners will be alerted to the recall on or around November 7, 2024. They will be asked to take their vehicle to a dealer where the CAB connector will be correctly secured.",
