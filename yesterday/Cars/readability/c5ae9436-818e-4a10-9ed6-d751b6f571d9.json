  "text": "The Polestar 3 Long Range Single Motor packs 295 hp and 350 miles of range December 5, 2024 at 19:46 by Michael Gauthier Polestar has begun producing the 3 Long Range Single Motor, which starts at $67,500. The crossover sports a rear-mounted motor producing 295 hp and 361 lb-ft of torque. The entry-level variant comes nicely equipped and has an EPA range of up to 350 miles. The Polestar 3 lineup is expanding as the company has begun building a new entry-level variant in Charleston, South Carolina. Known as the Long Range Single Motor, the latest version of the electric crossover starts at $67,500 before a $1,400 destination fee. That’s $5,900 less than the dual-motor all-wheel drive variant and the good news doesn’t end there as the entry-level model has an EPA range of up to 350 miles (563 km/h). That’s 35 miles (56 km) more than its counterpart. More: Polestar 3 Deliveries Begin As New RWD Variant Debuts However, there are some obvious tradeoffs as the crossover has a rear-mounted motor producing 295 hp (220 kW / 299 PS) and 361 lb-ft (489 Nm) of torque. This results in a 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) time of 7.5 seconds. When it comes time to replenish the 111 kWh battery pack, a 250 kW DC fast charger can take it from a 10-80% charge in as little as 30 minutes. The Polestar 3 Long Range Single Motor comes nicely equipped with LED headlights, rain-sensing wipers, and acoustic windows. They’re joined by a panoramic glass roof, a power liftgate, and 20-inch wheels. Moving inside, drivers will find a 9-inch digital instrument cluster and a 14.5-inch infotainment system. Other highlights include eight-way power heated front seats, a tri-zone climate control system, a wireless smartphone charger, and a 10-speaker audio system. An assortment of driver assistance systems come standard including Pilot Assist, Lane Change Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control, and Blind Spot Information with Steer Assist. Buyers will also find Lane Departure Warning, Road Sign Information, and Rear Collision Warning and Mitigation. An assortment of options are available including a $5,500 Plus Pack that adds a 25-speaker Bowers \u0026 Wilkins audio system, a head-up display, a heated steering wheel, and heated rear seats. The package also includes soft-close doors, a power-adjustable steering column, and a foldable load floor.  The Polestar 3 Long Range Single Motor will also be offered in Europe where it will have a WLTP range of up to 438 miles (706 km). German pricing starts at €79,890 while Brits will need to shell out £69,900.",
