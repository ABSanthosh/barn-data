  "text": "A scooterist hit the robotaxi, which then almost hit the scooterist May 29, 2025 at 20:14 by Michael Gauthier Zoox recalled 270 robotaxis due to a software bug that might not detect people near the vehicle. The problem was discovered after an e-scooterist struck the vehicle and nearly got hit. The company is planning to open up its robotaxi service to the public in Las Vegas later this year. Amazon’s Zoox promises to revolutionize transportation, but there are still a number of bugs that need to be worked out. That’s clear today following a close call in San Francisco on May 8. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an unoccupied robotaxi was stopped when it was struck by an e-scooterist. The person fell to the ground directly next to the vehicle, which then started moving forward in autonomous mode. More: Amazon’s Zoox Under Investigation After Two Motorcycle Collisions Thankfully, the robotaxi didn’t make contact with the e-scooterist. However, they still suffered minor injuries from crashing into the vehicle. In response to the close call, Zoox paused driverless operations and conducted an internal review. This eventually found that when a vehicle is stopped, moving very slowly, or about to resume travel from a stop, it may not detect vulnerable road users who are laying prone at “certain locations immediately adjacent to the vehicle.” This means the software would allow the vehicle to move forward as no obstacles were discovered. Photos Zoox This would only happen at speeds less than 1.1 mph (0.5 m/s). However, Zoox has now addressed the problem with a software update, which has been validated in simulations as well as real-world testing. The company rolled out the software update to all 270 robotaxis last week and recently resumed operations. Recall aside, Zoox has been keeping a relatively low profile, but they released their first commercial in February. Before that, they expanded operations in Las Vegas and started operating in San Francisco. While the company has been flying under the radar, they previously announced plans to open up their robotaxis to the public in Las Vegas later this year. The effort is part of an “early rider program,” which will give free rides to select people in exchange for feedback.",
