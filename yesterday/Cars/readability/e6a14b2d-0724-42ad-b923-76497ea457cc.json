  "text": "China's new VW Lavida Pro sedan is similar in size to the Passat sold in the USA April 17, 2025 at 20:42 by Brad Anderson This new Volkswagen sedan is significantly smaller than the longer and wider Passat Pro. The Lavida Pro is offered exclusively with a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine. VW has given the compact sedan a sharp exterior design, but has yet to reveal the interior. VW sells a wide range of models in China through its three joint ventures with SAIC, FAW, and JAC, which we in the West will never get to see. This is one of them. It’s called the VW Lavida Pro, and it appears to be an updated version of the regular Lavida, which is loosely related to the North American Jetta. It’s produced through the SAIC-VW partnership. Newly released images from China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology reveal a surprisingly bold exterior design for the Lavida Pro, at least by Volkswagen standards. While many VW sedans sold in the US and other regions tend to stick to soft lines, smooth curves, and understated surfaces, the Lavida Pro goes in a slightly different direction. Read: VW Passat Pro Is A Longer, Luxurious Sedan For China Although it still includes plenty of curves, the Lavida Pro adopts a sharper overall look. Its front end features a wide gloss black grille paired with thin headlights that integrate slim LED daytime running lights. It’s a more aggressive face than we typically see from VW sedans. Finished here in a pink-lavender paint, the Lavida Pro will be offered with 15- and 16-inch wheels with three different designs and comes standard with door handles that sit flush with the bodywork. Found at the rear are LED taillights and a light bar not dissimilar to other VW models, including even the Jetta sold Stateside. Data shows the Lavida Pro measures 4,720 mm (185.8 inches) in length, 1,806 mm (71.1 inches) in width, and 1,482 mm (58.3 inches) in height, with a 2,688 mm (105.8-inch) wheelbase. That gives it a footprint similar to the North American Jetta. The car weighs in at 3,924 lbs (1,780 kg) and will be offered exclusively with VW’s EA211 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine. Output is rated at 109 hp (81 kW), sent to the front wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. This new model is quite a bit smaller than the VW Passat Pro added to the brand’s Chinese range last year. That model is 5,006 mm (197.1 inches) long, 1,850 mm (72.8 inches) wide, and 1,489 mm (58.6 inches) tall. Interior images haven’t been released yet, but it’s safe to assume the Lavida Pro will share much of its cabin layout and features with other recent VW models. Expect a familiar mix of digital displays and VW’s standard switchgear. This isn’t the only new addition to VW’s range of sedans in China. Last month, the first photos and details of the new Lamando L emerged. It is related to the Sagitar which is the Chinese version of the Jetta. Whereas the Lavida Pro is capped at 109 hp (81 kW), the Lamando L has a more powerful 1.5-liter with 158 hp (118 kW).",
