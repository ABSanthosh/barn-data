  "text": "Jul 15, 2025 8:30 PM EDTThe automaker wants to enhance the appeal of its full-size SUVs According to numbers released by Stellantis earlier this month, the Jeep brand’s U.S. sales for the first half of this year are only up a modest 2% over the same period in 2024. But while models like the Compass and the iconic Wrangler saw double-digit growth over the course of the first half of this year and the last quarter (Q2 2025), it isn’t roses and bald eagles for all the SUVs that wear the seven-slot grille. Stellantis’s numbers indicate that both the Wagoneer and its posher brother, the Grand Wagoneer took a heck of a sales nosedive during the second quarter of this year. During Q2 2025, Jeep moved 8,216 Wagoneers and just 1,307 Grand Wagoneers, representing a 51% and 67% sales dip, respectively. Sales data from other brands indicate that competing nameplates like the Ford Expedition and the Chevy Suburban are experiencing massive sales surges; however, the Jeep brand is determined to win some value-minded customers over to the seven-slotted machines with new limited-run special edition models. Meet the Wagoneers In a recent announcement, Jeep introduced two new value-minded limited-run models that are built for “a defined customer in mind” in the form of the new Jeep Wagoneer Limited and the Wagoneer Super. The Wagoneer Limited is made for “the value-conscious customer ready to step into a full-size SUV only the Jeep brand can create,” sweetening the deal with some cool design features, including body-color fender flares, chrome exterior badges, black color lower front and rear fascias, and a swanky set of 22-inch chrome wheels. Though it may seem like the Limited may be nothing less than a styling package, Jeep gave it some features from the options book to enhance convenience for owners and their families, including power side steps, power-folding second and third row seats, a tri-pane sunroof that extends throughout the cabin, and a Surround View Camera for added visibility. The Jeep Wagoneer Super is a value-packed throwback Though the Wagoneer Limited may be a compelling choice for some buyers, Jeep has a car for those who want just a little bit more. The brand is resurrecting the Super name, a name that dates back to the Super Wagoneer that first launched in 1966. While the original Super Wagoneer from nearly sixty years ago had features like power brakes and power steering, 2025’s new Jeep Wagoneer Super comes with a smattering of goodies, including a two-tone black painted roof, body-color fender flares, and a premium soft-touch wrapped interior—all features that were previously reserved for buyers of the swankier Grand Wagoneer. Also included are 22-inch machined black aluminum wheels that look similar to those from the Ram 1500 Laramie, a full trim black-out package, which darkens the badging and grille rings, carbide headlights, black-finished power side steps, a tri-pane panoramic sunroof, and a McIntosh 19-speaker premium audio system. Final thoughts Pricing details reveal that these models do carry a bit of a premium over their “regular” models. The Wagoneer Limited has an MSRP of $76,535 (including destination), while the Super has an MSRP of $82,535, which is competitively priced with rivals like the Ford Expedition Platinum and the GMC Yukon Denali, respectively. Detroit’s manufacturers do very well in the U.S. full-size SUV market, with some Japanese players like the Nissan Armada, Toyota Grand Highlander, and Sequoia also competing in the space. However, Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep-Ram dealers’ attitude towards sales and incentives can sweeten the deal even further at the right time. About the AuthorJames Ochoa",
