  "description": "Just about a month ago, we reported that Mahindra plans to introduce new variants to the XEV 9e line-up, essentially to make the large 79kWh battery pack a little more accessible. Now, a recent filing by Mahindra on the government’s transport website corroborates our report while also shedding details on the upcoming variants. 79kWh battery to be made available on Pack Three Select trim Top-spec Pack Three to also get the smaller 59kWh battery Similar updates are expected on the BE 6 soon Mahindra XEV 9e new trim details Two new trims incoming  Currently, the larger 79kWh battery on the Mahindra XEV 9e is only offered with the top-spec Pack Three trim, while all lower trims come with the 59kWh battery pack. With the update, Mahindra will offer the 79kWh battery with the second-from-base Pack Three Select trim; meanwhile, the choice of a 59kWh battery will be made available with the top-spec Pack Three trim. Mahindra should, therefore, be able to price the Pack Three trim also more competitively. The Pack Three exclusively comes with the ADAS suite and head-up display, but speaking to Autocar India, Rajesh Jejurikar, the company’s executive director and CEO (Auto and Farm Sector), had previously said that customers are prioritising higher range over features. Mahindra XEV 9e powertrain, variant details The XEV 9e is currently available in four trims: Pack One, Pack Two, Pack Three Select and Pack Three. There are two battery pack options: 59kWh and 79kWh. The former produces 231hp/380Nm and has a range of 542km; the latter makes 286hp/380Nm and returns 656km (ARAI); both are rear-wheel-drive only.

Pack Three Select deliveries just started in June, and Pack Two and Pack One will only be delivered from July and August onwards, respectively. The ex-showroom prices for the Mahindra XEV 9e currently range between Rs 22.65 lakh and Rs 31.25 lakh.   Also See: Vinfast VF 6 spied testing in India Audi A4 Signature Edition launched at Rs 57.11 lakh",
