ChargePoint’s recent announcement aims to address that problem with affordable chargers aimed directly at commercial electric fleets. ChargePoint said its new CPF50 Level 2 charger is available for $699. It comes as a standalone unit or pedestal mounted, and the company said it can be configured with either J1772 or NACS plugs.Company CEO Rick Wilmer said, “ChargePoint has always been committed to making it easy for everyone to go electric, whether they be a driver, a business, or a fleet. With our lowest cost charger for commercial vehicles we have a solution that makes charging more accessible for small businesses who want to electrify their fleet, or for large fleets that are focused on reducing total cost of ownership. We’re making the hardware more affordable, and when combined with our powerful fleet software platform, the offering can meet the charging needs of fleets of all sizes to optimize their savings.” ChargePoint’s other commercial solution, Megawatt, offers charging at up to 20 times the speed of existing DC chargers. The company said it can recharge a long-haul truck in less than an hour, keeping trucks moving more efficiently through the process.[Images: ChargePoint, Nikola]Become a TTAC insider.
