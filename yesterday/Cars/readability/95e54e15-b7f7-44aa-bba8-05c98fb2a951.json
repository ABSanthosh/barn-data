  "description": "Chinese electric crossover has been revised ahead of its arrival in the UK. Has it been brought up to scratch? Before we delve into the merits of the Skywell BE11 as a car, let’s consider where its maker comes from.Skywell emerged in China in 2017 as a joint venture between one of the world's largest consumer electronics groups, Skyworth, and electric bus maker Nanjing Golden Dragon.Its cars are now being brought here by Gloucestershire-based importer Innovation Automotive.The BE11 is being introduced as not only Skywell's first car but also its attempt to grab a share of the UK fleet market and rival everything from the Ford Mustang Mach-E to the Skoda Enyaq and Nissan Ariya to the KGM Torres EVX.We initially drove a prototype and, truth be told, we didn't much like it. The steering was too light, the infotainment system was near-unfathomable, the speedometer only showed in KPH and the brakes were spongy.But Skywell has since fitted the BE11 with a new BYD-sourced motor, reduced the wheel size from 20in to 19in, reconfigured the suspension for comfort and downsized the infotainment screen by 2.2in so that users can see the 'start/stop' button once hidden behind it.This, then, is our chance to drive the finished product and find out if this new player has a fighting chance of success in the UK.The Skywell BE11 range at a glanceThe BE11 range is very simple, because there's only one trim level. Two different battery sizes are available: a 72kWh unit offering 248 miles of range and an 86kWh Long Range unit that yields 304 miles. Both are nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) in their chemistry and sit within the car's wheelbase.The single motor powers the front wheels, making 201bhp and 236lb ft of torque, which is good for a 0-62mph time of 9.6sec and a top speed of 93mph. All cars sit on passive suspension with a torsion beam at the rear and there's no option of four-wheel drive.",

  "text": "One benefit of its size in comparison with its competitors is the amount of interior space on offer, and as this is the sort of car you will buy for its size, let's start there. For rear occupants, the BE11 excels. There's a limousine-like spaciousness back there that's missing in most of its key rivals, with sufficient leg room for anyone of any size and just enough head room for people over 6ft tall. It's the same story up front: the standard-fit panoramic sunroof makes the cabin feel light and airy, and the generously-sized footwells mean your legs have a chance to stretch out. The 467-litre boot is only average for the class; the Enyaq gets 585 litres and the Ariya 466 litres. There are plenty of storage compartments and cubby holes, however, and overall fit and finish is passable, with soft-touch materials lining the front and rear door cards and dashboard. Skywell boasts about its cars having \"industrial heritage\" and thus the quality to back that up, but you don't have to look very hard to find evidence of frivolity. The rose-tint finish of the door handles and trim pieces looks tacky, the wood veneers feel as fake as they look and, on our brand-new test car, some of the plastic surfacing was already scratched. Which brings us to another less successful attribute: the infotainment system. It runs from a large 12.8in touchscreen, which you get as standard alongside a 12.3in digital instrumentation display. Evidence of new-brand weirdness arises from the moment you turn it on, when you're greeted by a message in a Chinese language alongside another saying “Good afternoon , Dear User”. Dig a little deeper and you will spot more bad punctuation, alongside horrible graphics and haphazard menu structures. The actual definition of the display is pretty good, but the way in which buttons and menus are presented is not. Nor is its functionality. It took us three attempts and two phones to connect to Apple CarPlay, and there's a frustrating amount of lag once your phone is connected to it.  Skywell has seen fit to omit a physical volume button, instead burying it in the touchscreen. The only issue with this is that, when connected to Apple CarPlay, the adjuster is five clicks away. And because CarPlay removes the permanent bar for the air conditioning controls, those are three clicks away. You will likely need to use smartphone mirroring for much of the time, too, because the native sat-nav system (called TurboDog 9) isn't fitted to early cars. Later models will have it, but the system can't be retrofitted, in spite of the application appearing on the screen. Because early BE11s underwent their European type approval before July 2024 and thus didn't have to comply with GSR2 regulations, they will not be fitted with ADAS. This means that you can expect a safety rating of less than five stars if it's ever tested for safety by Euro NCAP. Skywell says it's “looking into” introducing ADAS in the future.",
