  "description": "Ducati’s Monster range is set to receive an update with an all-new 890cc engine, and now, the first few shots of the test mule have surfaced online. Here’s everything we can deduce from the spy shots.   The next-gen Ducati Monster will feature the all-new 890cc engine It will feature an all-new rear subframe with a redesigned main frame Its engine radiator is noticeably larger to aid cooling Next-gen Ducati Monster spotted testing We expect this next-gen Monster to be unveiled in 2026 Just a day after our report on Ducati’s plans to equip the Monster and Desert X with its all-new 890cc engine, the first spy shots of the next-gen Monster have surfaced online.  Visually, the crankcase and engine shape are clearly different, confirming that this isn’t the outgoing 937cc Testastretta motor. The radiator appears to be larger and longer than the outgoing model. The rear subframe has been completely redesigned, and we expect the main frame to be revised as well, in line with Ducati’s new-gen 890cc models. The catalytic converter looks bulkier, and Ducati seems to be future-proofing the next-gen Monster for the next few cycles of emissions norms.  Not much can be made out about the next-gen Monster’s design because the test mule seen still appears to be an early one and has rather spartan bodywork. What can be discerned, however, is that the Monster will stick with its trademark round headlight, and the new 890 is likely to be even more svelte than the current-generation Monster.
