  "text": "Several vehicles and windows were reportedly shot at Tesla's Tigard store in Oregon this time around 19 seconds ago by Michael Gauthier After getting shot up last week, a Tesla dealership has been victimized again. The latest shooting caused “extensive damage to cars and showroom windows.” Police are asking for the public’s help and they’re being aided by the ATF and FBI. For the second time in a week, a Tesla dealership in Tigard, Oregon has been hit by gunfire. The latest incident occurred early this morning around 4:15 AM local time. The Tigard Police Department said more than a dozen shots were fired in the latest attack, which caused “extensive damage to cars and showroom windows.” Interestingly, authorities noted the presence of a security guard didn’t deter the shooter. More: Oregon Tesla Dealership Hit By Gunfire, FBI Investigating Police weren’t able to catch the person(s) responsible, but they arrived on the scene quickly and will be working with the ATF as well as the FBI as part of their investigation. Speaking of which, an explosive detection dog from the ATF was deployed to sniff for possible shell casings. Police added they’re in the process of collecting evidence as well as surveillance footage from the area. On top of that, they’re asking anyone who might have seen or heard something to contact them. The same dealership was targeted on March 6, when at least seven shots were fired. This damaged three vehicles and shattered multiple windows. One bullet even went through an office wall and into a computer monitor. It remains unclear if the attacks are connected but, following the initial incident, Tigard Police noted Tesla dealerships have been “targeted across Oregon and the nation for political reasons.” That’s putting it mildly as Elon Musk has emerged as one of the most divisive people in America. This follows a questionable salute, close ties to President Trump, and the gutting of the federal government as the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency. The culmination of this has resulted in a series of attacks across the country and occasionally overseas. Tesla owners have also found themselves in the crosshairs, leaving a number of them concerned about their safety.",
