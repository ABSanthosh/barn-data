Previously listed on BaT in June 2024, this Ford GT is now offered again in Canada by the seller on behalf of the owner with an ordering kit, a window sticker, an owner’s manual, memorabilia, a car cover, a clean Carfax report, and Ontario registration. First unveiled at the 2015 North American International Auto Show, the Chris Svensson–designed second-generation GT was built by Multimatic of Markham, Ontario, with production beginning in December 2016. The GT features a carbon-fiber monocoque structure bolted to front and rear aluminum subframes that serve as stressed members for the hydraulically adjustable pushrod suspension system. Carbon-fiber underside aero panels are fitted fore and aft, and the car is further equipped with a front-axle lift system, variable ride height, launch control, and selectable driving modes. This example is finished Frozen White with over-the-top Sonic Blue Pearl Metallic stripes, which were fitted as a $19k option. Additional details include matte carbon-fiber exterior trim along with LED lighting, a lightweight Gorilla Glass windshield, butterfly doors, a retractable active rear wing, and a rear diffuser. Staggered-width 20″ forged aluminum wheels finished in Satin Silver are mounted with 245/35 front and 325/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires.

Factory rated output was 647 horsepower and 550 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Getrag seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle.
