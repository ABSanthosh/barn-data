  "text": "The transformation is eye-catching, though not everyone loves the extreme drop and aggressive camber angles June 6, 2025 at 20:19 by Thanos Pappas T-Demand revealed modified Tesla Model 3 and Y EVs with an extreme lowrider stance. Both EVs feature custom air suspension, upgraded brakes, and aftermarket alloy wheels. Chassis upgrades favor aggressive style over usability and come with a steep price tag. While Tesla’s clean-cut image typically favors minimalist design over wild customization, that hasn’t stopped some tuners from giving its EVs a much more dramatic makeover. Japanese outfit T-Demand, best known for modifying Toyotas and Lexuses, has now set its sights on the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y, bringing with it a distinctively low-slung attitude. True to its roots, T-Demand has outfitted both Teslas with its signature suspension components, drastically altering their stance. The result? Two EVs that ride far lower than anything that ever rolled off a Fremont assembly line. More: Toyota Crown Signia Turned Into The Wagon It Was Always Meant To Be Starting with the Tesla Model Y Juniper, the electric crossover rides on a new set of 21-inch alloy wheels, wrapped in low-profile Nitto tires (245/35R21). Thanks to a custom air suspension setup, ground clearance has been dropped to sports car levels, making the Model Y look more like its Model 3 sibling. It’s not just lower, it’s also wider in presence thanks to a steep 5.5 degrees of negative camber at both axles. T-Demand didn’t stop there, adding a performance brake kit with 380 mm (15-inch) discs and six-piston calipers for good measure. Model 3 Highland Goes Even Lower The Model 3 Highland follows the same theme but takes the specs a step further. It rides on 20-inch alloys paired with stretched 255/30R20 tires, and features an even more aggressive alignment: 8 degrees of negative camber up front, and 9 degrees at the rear. This sedan also benefits from custom suspension arms (ProArm) and rides on a three-stage height-adjustable air suspension (ProDamper Airsus). In its lowest setting, the belly of the Tesla barely clears the tarmac, making it best suited for Japan’s smooth highways rather than your typical street with speed bumps and potholes. The modified Tesla Model 3 (above) compared to the Model Y (below). Both demo cars were built by Man’z Factory and are based on rear-wheel-drive variants. Finished in white with stock body panels and single-motor electric drivetrains, they stick to visual and suspension upgrades rather than chasing performance. Clean Look, Steep Price Of course, achieving this extreme stance doesn’t come cheap. The basic air suspension kit, which includes a pressure management system, is priced at ¥780,000 ($5,400). Add the full ProArm suspension components, and you’re looking at an additional ¥1,204,500 ($8,400). The high-performance brake kit adds another ¥1,280,400 ($8,900), and that’s before you add the new wheels and tires. More: Europeans Are Done With Tesla Except For One Country That Can’t Stop Buying All the aforementioned prices are before taxes and don’t include fitment. For US customers interested in bringing this Japanese styling stateside, we reached out to T-Demand’s American division for a quote, but have yet to receive a response. The slammed look won’t win over everyone, especially since it comes at the expense of everyday practicality and doesn’t offer any real performance gains. Still, there’s no question the ultra-low stance will turn heads, and probably spark more than a few double takes, everywhere it goes. T-Demand",
