  "text": "NASCAR is aiming to return to the streets of Chicago in 2027, and could still swing by Chicagoland Speedway or Road America next year.As for San Diego, the race will be held Father's Day weekend and be held at Naval Base Coronado.“What a special way to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Navy, the 250th anniversary of our country,” said Ben Kennedy, NASCAR’s executive vice president and chief venue and racing innovation officer, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.“NASCAR embodies the very best of the American spirit through speed, precision and an unyielding pursuit of excellence,” Secretary of the Navy John C. Phelan said in a press release. “It’s not just a historic first, it’s a powerful tribute to the values we share: grit, teamwork and love of country. From the flight deck to the finish line, this collaboration reflects the operational intensity and unity of purpose that define both the United States Navy and NASCAR. We’re proud to open our gates to the American people, honor those who serve, and inspire the next generation to step forward and serve something greater than themselves.” According to the Sun-Times, the course will be constrained a bit by the location, but there will be aircraft carriers as a backdrop.“Part of the course will be a bit set in stone because we can’t move many of the streets around, but part of it will also be a blank canvas as well,” Kennedy said. “Once we go out on the tarmac, whether it’s hairpins or chicanes or S-turns, long straightaways, we’re playing with a handful of configurations and we have a few drivers that we’ve gotten feedback from on what that could potentially look like.”The Chicago race, it seems, has given NASCAR the information it needs to hold street races elsewhere.“I think [racing in San Diego] emphasizes the fact that not only we can race literally anywhere in the world, but that we have some of the best and most versatile drivers in all of motorsports as well,” Kennedy said. “It’s the most diverse schedule that we have in our sport, and I would argue the most diverse schedule across all of motorsports when you consider the different amounts of track types that we race at.”Kennedy's quotes are courtesy of the Sun-Times.NASCAR street races are a good idea -- let's hope that by 2027, there's more than one per season.[Images © 2025 Tim Healey/TTAC.com]Become a TTAC insider.
