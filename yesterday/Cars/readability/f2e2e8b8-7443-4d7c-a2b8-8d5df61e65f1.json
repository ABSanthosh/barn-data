  "description": "Bovensiepen family launches a new coachbuilding outfit with a Zagato-styled Bentley Conti GT rival The Bovensiepen family, founders of legendary German BMW tuning house Alpina, have launched their own coachbuilding business with the unveiling of a new 600bhp super-GT at the Villa d'Este Concorso d'Eleganza. With Alpina now owned by BMW itself, the family is shifting its focus to become \"a manufacturer of outstanding automobiles that embody the ambition of fine driving\".  The first post-Alpina project from the outfit – named simply Bovensiepen – is an imposing, BMW M4-based grand tourer called Zagato, in reference to the famous Italian design house responsible for its styling. Zagato has previously collaborated with Aston Martin, Ferrari, Bentley, Maserati and Alfa Romeo, and its first effort for Bovensiepen is described as \"a harmonious composition of individual design\" which \"features and bears the unmistakable signature of the traditional Milanese design studio\". It is said to take more than 250 hours to build the Zagato, of which production will be \"strictly limited\" - though no precise figure has been given. Pricing and availability will be given at the end of this year, ahead of deliveries beginning in summer next year.  Each car can be, Bovensiepen promises, \"as unique as its owner\", with extensive personalisation options available for the interior and exterior.  It is extensively differentiated from the BMW on which it is based by a totally bespoke treatment at the front and rear, a reshaped bonnet and side profile, and Zagato's trademark 'double bubble' roof. The Bovensiepen Zagato features a 3.0-litre straight six engine that produces 603bhp and 516lb ft for a 0-62mph time of just 3.3 seconds, and a top speed in excess of 186mph, Bovensiepen claims. It has bespoke Bilstein dampers that can be configured in three driving modes – Comforst, Sport and Sport Plus – which Bovensiepen says offers \"a range from pronounced comfort to athletic driving dynamics\". It also gains a lightweight, twin-exit titanium exhaust system from Akrapovic, which is said to be 40% lighter than the standard system. BMW will reveal the next steps for the Alpina brand in 2026, it has said, with ex-Polestar designer Max Missoni joining the German firm to lead the styling for all luxury models, including Alpinas. The Bovensiepen Zagato's unveiling comes just a day after BMW revealed its own 8 Series-based special edition, the £430,000 Speedtop shooting brake, which is due in production next year.",
