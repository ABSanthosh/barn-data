  "description": "The Nissan Magnite will get a new CNG version by April this year, which will come as a dealer-level accessory kit, said a source. This comes shortly after its sister car, the Renault Kiger, received a dealer-level CNG kit, along with the Kwid and Triber. Magnite CNG to be offered with 1.0 NA petrol-MT The CNG kit will be a dealer-level accessory fitment Expect a premium similar to the Kiger CNG Nissan Magnite CNG: what to expect? CNG kit to have a 1-year dealer warranty Our sources have stated that only the 1.0-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine with the manual gearbox will be offered with the CNG kit, echoing the Renault Kiger CNG. The CNG version of the Magnite is expected to return 18-22km per kg. However, detailed specifications, including power and torque outputs with the CNG kit, are not yet available. The Magnite CNG will have the same warranty that Nissan provides as standard for the regular SUV – 3 years or 1,00,000 km, whichever comes first. Additionally, the dealer will provide a 1-year warranty for the CNG kit. The dealers will also ensure RC is updated to reflect the conversion. The CNG kit for the Renault Kiger costs an additional Rs 79,500 over the trim it’s based on, and a similar premium is expected for the Magnite CNG. The CNG kits will be supplied to dealers by the Uno Minda Group. It remains to be seen if the CNG kit will be offered across the line-up or only on select trims. We've reached out to Nissan for an official comment, but the company hasn't responded yet. Growing CNG popularity in India Maruti leads with a 71.60 percent market share As per retail sales data sourced from the Vahan portal, a total of 7,15,213 CNG-powered passenger vehicles were sold in India in the last calendar year by the four carmakers in this segment, marking a strong 35 percent year-on-year increase. Maruti Suzuki, with a 15-model strong CNG portfolio, has a vice-like grip over the segment with a 71.60 percent market share. Tata Motors and Hyundai follow with 16.13 percent and 10.04 percent, respectively, while Toyota has a market share of 2.21 percent. Given its growing popularity, Honda and Renault have recently joined the bandwagon with dealer-level CNG kits, and Nissan will soon follow suit. The CNG kit on the Magnite could further attract additional buyers to the compact SUV.
