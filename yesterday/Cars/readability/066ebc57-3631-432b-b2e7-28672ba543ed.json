  "text": "The Mustang driver also managed to catch his own reflection in the mirror while recording the stunt March 30, 2025 at 21:01 by Brad Anderson The young lad had just pulled out from an auction dealer lot in Texas. This Mustang appears to be an EcoBoost model, not the V8-powered GT. We can’t tell how much damage was done to the front of the muscle car. There’s a fine line between horsepower and poor decision-making, and some people really like to floor it across that line. Now, here’s a short message to anyone who drives a Ford Mustang: these cars are rear-wheel drive, and because they have a lot of power, the rear wheels will quickly lose traction and start to spin if the traction control is turned off. While this should be obvious to anyone who’s ever driven a performance car, or watched one on YouTube, it seems there’s still a subset of Mustang drivers who haven’t gotten the memo, like this young chap. This short clip that was recently shared on the Instagram page @slavic_GNC, as well as Reddit, shows a guy driving a Mustang out of what was either a dealership lot or, according to some commenters, could have been a Manheim auction location in Dallas. There’s no word on whether he’s the owner of the Ford, but regardless, he’ll now be left to foot an expensive insurance and/or repair bill. Watch: Mustang Goes On A Rampage, Destroys Cars And Snowballs Locals Moments after taking off, the driver pulls out onto the road and pins the throttle of the Mustang. As he does so, he films himself with his iPhone in one hand and his left hand on the wheel. Immediately, the rear end of the Mustang steps out, and he quickly countersteers to avoid spinning. While he catches this initial slide, the Ford’s rear end kicks out in the opposite direction, and he’s unable to save it, slamming into a crash barrier on the side of the road. Video Reddit The judgment on display here is impressive in all the wrong ways. Not only did he disable traction control on a high-powered, rear-drive car, he chose to drive one-handed, record the entire event with his phone, inadvertently catch his own face in the rear-view mirror, and then—naturally—upload it online for the world to see. Now, to be fair, Ford Mustang drivers get a lot of flack. And honestly, most of them drive like responsible adults who understand how physics works. But scenes like this don’t help. There are plenty of bad eggs out there, and every incident like this just reinforces the stereotype, dragging the rest down with them.",
