Powered by a 4.9-liter flat-12 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle, the car is finished in Nero over beige Connolly leather. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, a Tubi exhaust system, center-locking 16″ five-spoke alloy wheels, pop-up headlights, power windows, an Alpine cassette stereo, and a gated shifter. This Testarossa is offered with service records, manufacturer’s literature, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Nero and features pop-up headlights, fog lights, an asymmetrical cooling duct beneath the left fog lamp, side intake strakes, black-finished rocker panels, and quad exhaust outlets. Paintless dent repair and paint correction were performed, and the front spoiler and rocker trim were refinished in 2025. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. Center-locking staggered-width 16″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Yokohama AVID V4S tires. Braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated discs. The front brake components were replaced in 2025. The cockpit is trimmed in beige Connolly leather upholstery over the seats, door panels, and lower dashboard. Interior amenities include an Alpine cassette stereo, motorized seat belts, and a gated shifter located on the center console alongside controls for the air conditioning and power windows. The power window motor was repaired, and the air conditioning system was serviced with a R134a conversion and a recharge in 2025. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames Veglia instrumentation including a 200-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,800-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil pressure and coolant temperature. A clock and auxiliary gauges for fuel level and oil temperature are housed in the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 35k miles, approximately 200 of which were added under current ownership. The 4.9-liter flat-12 was factory rated at 380 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque. The alternator was rebuilt in March 2025, and an engine-out timing belt service was completed in April 2025, at which time the water pump was rebuilt, and the timing belt tensioner, spark plugs, drive belts, fuel filter, thermostat, and various gaskets and seals were replaced. The car passed a California emissions inspection in April 2025. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. A Tubi exhaust system has been added, and the underside was treated with dry ice in preparation for the sale. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage from its first entry in June 1992. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
