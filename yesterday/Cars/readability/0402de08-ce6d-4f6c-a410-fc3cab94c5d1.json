  "text": "The issue affects approximately 70 vehicles in the US and involves several bolts that could be looser than they should 1 hour ago by Stephen Rivers Toyota and Lexus are recalling “approximately” 70 vehicles in the US. They include 2024 RAV4 and NX models with wheels and brakes that may detach. It’s unclear what causes the problem in detail, but it poses a serious safety risk. Recalls happen all of the time but often, the issue is something relatively small. Perhaps a sticker is missing or owners have the ability to adjust headlight positioning when they’re not supposed to. In other cases, like this new recall from Toyota and Lexus, the safety concern is clear and apparent. According to the automakers, they’re recalling around 70 cars from the US market. That population includes both the Toyota RAV4 and the Lexus NX, all built in September of this year. The reason is that their wheels and brakes could fall off. More: Toyota And Subaru Sued Over 86 And BRZ Engines Failing Due To Oil Starvation That’s right, both the wheel and brake caliper could exit the vehicle unexpectedly. Here’s exactly how Toyota puts it: “Certain bolts may not have been properly tightened during manufacturing and can loosen over time, potentially causing the front brake calipers or front wheels to detach. If this occurs, there can be an increase in stopping distance or a loss of vehicle control, increasing the risk of crash.” To be very clear, the RAV4 and NX don’t use a single bolt or set of bolts to hold both things to the car. These are separate parts, and the fact that both could fall off is genuinely surprising. While the NHTSA hasn’t released detailed information on the issue, Toyota hints at the problem. It says that during the recall remedy process, technicians will check torque on the hub axle nut and on the caliper bracket bolts. Again, these are completely separate parts. It’s unusual that both could have loose fasteners on the same vehicle from the factory. Below is a look at the components and how they work together. Part number two in the diagram shows the axle nut. It has one main responsibility: keep the wheel assembly and brake assembly safely attached. Figures five and six show the caliper bracket and its fasteners which, of course, should keep that assembly together as well. Typically, if one fails, it doesn’t immediately impact the other. Toyota We’ll have to wait on further information from the NHTSA to see if the failure of the axle nut might then lead to the failure of the caliper bracket bolts. That’s what might be happening, although we can’t be certain. In any case, Toyota says it’ll notify owners by February 2025.  There is no word yet on whether the automaker is aware of any warranty claims, accidents or injuries caused by this issue. Concerned owners can visit Toyota.com/recall, Lexus.com/recall, or nhtsa.gov/recalls and enter their vehicle’s VIN or license plate to see whether they are affected.",
