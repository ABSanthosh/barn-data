  "description": "Three years ago, the annual Pierer Mobility investor presentation revealed that KTM was working on an electric version of the Duke. Now, a prototype version of the E-Duke has been seen for the first time.  E-Duke uses chassis elements from 390 Duke It will likely be made in India A Husqvarna E-Pilen is also in the works This prototype has come to light thanks to a video shared by stunt rider Rok Bagoros, who has a close working relationship with KTM. The video was taken in KTM’s Motohall display area, which is at the company’s headquarters in Mattighofen, Austria. KTM E-Duke battery and range Could have a 5.5kWH battery pack No specification details are available, but the 2022 presentation stated that the KTM E-Duke would get a 10kW (nominal power) electric motor along with a 5.5kWh battery pack. That could result in a quick and engaging performance, although it would be hard to see a realistic range of over 100km with such a small battery pack – and that would be with some very well-behaved riding. KTM E-Duke chassis and underpinnings Closely related to the 390 Duke’s rolling chassis A battery pack of this size will result in a well-controlled weight figure. With some luck, this motorcycle could end up weighing well below the current 390 Duke, which tips the scales at 168kg. The comparison is a fair one, considering that the E-Duke prototype appears to use a closely related version of the 390 Duke’s rolling chassis. This includes the main trellis frame, aluminium swingarm, offset rear shock and even the wheels and brakes. The battery pack and motor are mounted down low, with the motor being where you’d expect to see an engine. Just like on a conventional KTM, the drive is sent to the rear wheel via a chain. However, things are interesting higher up, with a large hollow section where the front of the ‘fuel tank’ meets the headstock. This area appears to serve as an air intake for cooling the battery pack and/or electricals.  There’s also what looks like an integrated charging cable, which means that this bike may have an on-board charger, as we’ve seen with the Bajaj Chetak. An on-board charger would solve the issue most electric bikes face, where there’s no storage space to hold a bulky charger. KTM E-Duke design More futuristic take on the current Duke’s design language The main difference comes in the new subframe and the sharp bodywork, which looks like a more futuristic take on the current 390 Duke’s design language. The KTM theme is very much apparent with a big fuel tank, exaggerated fuel tank extensions and the deconstructed headlamp design that we’ve already seen in the new 990 Duke and 1390 Super Duke. Details that give away the fact this is still very much a prototype include the MotoGP-inspired air scoop that extends under the swingarm and the cool 3D-printed seat. This seat concept could be particularly interesting in a hot climate like ours, although keeping it clean might be a challenge. The rider faces a minimal cockpit with the typical wide handlebar and what appears to be the small 4.3-inch TFT display from the 390 Enduro R. Interestingly, KTM has gone for a scooter-style handbrake lever for the rear brake, although this is something the company does on its Freeride E-XC electric enduro bikes. KTM E-Duke likely to be made in India If the KTM E-Duke makes it to production, it will likely be made by Bajaj in India. On that topic, Bajaj recently rescued KTM from financial insolvency, and you can click here to read more about how the Indian two-wheeler major will soon be the majority shareholder in the Austrian company.  Also See: BMW Concept RR previews the brand’s future with M 1000 RR DNA Aprilia RS 457 engine reliability issues addressed, says brand",
