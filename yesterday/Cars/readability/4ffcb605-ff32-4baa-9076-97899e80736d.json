  "description": "The Indian passenger vehicle market saw a new record high of 4.34-million-unit wholesales in the fiscal year 2025, up from up from 4.23 million units in FY24. However, growth momentum is slowing, with the growth rate dropping to the low single digits—the lowest in four years—due to rising inventory levels and increasing discounts. The passenger car industry grew by just 2.6 percent in FY25, following growth rates of 13 percent, 27 percent, and 8.7 percent in FY22, FY23, and FY24, respectively, albeit on a lower base. FY25 marks the fourth consecutive year of YoY growth for the industry. Let’s take a closer look at how the major mass-market manufacturers fared across the last financial year. Maruti Suzuki YoY sales grew by just 0.05 percent The Wagon R was the brand's and India's best-selling model in FY2025. The good news for Maruti Suzuki in FY2025 is that the 17,60,767 vehicles sold are its best-ever fiscal year sales. The not-so-good news is that this number makes for flat sales of 0.05 percent – just an additional 886 units more than the 17,59,881 units sold in FY2024. On the export front, Maruti Suzuki has had a record fiscal – the 332,585 passenger vehicles exported in FY2025 are an 18 percent YoY increase (FY2024: 280,712 units). This also ensured the company retains the No. 1 passenger vehicle exporter title for the fourth fiscal in a row. The Wagon R was the brand's best seller in FY2025, and India's best selling car for four years in a row.  Hyundai Motor India YoY sales down by 3 percent The Creta made up nearly a third of Hyundai's total sales in FY2025 Hyundai Motor India, the second-ranked passenger vehicle manufacturer after Maruti Suzuki in volumes, has reported sales of 598,666 cars and SUVs in FY2025, down 3 percent year on year (FY2024: 614,717 units). SUVs continue to be key growth drivers for Hyundai. It is estimated that the Creta and the Creta Electric together have sold a total of 194,871 units in FY2025, making up almost a third of Hyundai’s total sales. This also marks strong 20 percent YoY growth for the Creta nameplate (FY2024: 162,773 units). Tata Motors YoY sales down by 3 percent The Punch was Tata's best seller in FY2025. Tata Motors has reported total wholesales of 553,585 passenger vehicles in FY2025, down 3 percent on its record FY2024 sales. This also means Tata Motors narrowly missed out on the second spot to Hyundai. For Tata Motors, the difference between its FY2025 and FY2024 performance is that its overall passenger vehicle wholesales have been dragged down by the marked 13 percent decline in demand for its EVs, which have been impacted by the increased competition. Tata Motors’ cumulative EV wholesales stood at 64,276 units. The company, however, has done well on the CNG front – it was the No 2 after Maruti Suzuki for most of FY2025 in CNG-powered car and SUV sales. The Punch – available with petrol, CNG and electric powertrains – was the brand's best seller in FY2025.  Mahindra and Mahindra YoY sales grew by 20 percent   The Scorpio twins were the main growth driver's for Mahindra. Mahindra has clocked its best-ever domestic sales of 5,51,487 units in FY2025. A robust 20 percent YoY growth is a result of the sustained and strong demand for most of its SUVs. While the Scorpio twins, XUV 3XO, XUV700 and Bolero are the main growth drivers, the five-door Thar Roxx has revved up volumes even as the two new born-electric BE 6 and XEV 9e have recently joined the party. The hard-charging Mahindra is just 2,098 units behind Tata Motors in FY2025. FY2025 saw four months of over 50,000 SUV wholesales, including best-ever monthly sales of 54,504 units in the festive month of October 2024. Toyota Kirloskar Motors YoY sales up by 26 percent The Innova has consistently been Toyota's best seller in India, and so was in FY2025 as well. Toyota has clocked its best-ever fiscal year sales and surpassed the 300,000 units milestone for the first time in the domestic market, riding on strong demand for its MPVs and SUVs as well as its quartet of rebadged models. Toyota’s wholesales of an estimated 309,334 passenger vehicles in FY2025 constitute robust 26 percent year-on-year growth (FY2024: 245,676 units). The Innova MPV twins – Crysta and Hycross – continue to be the biggest contributors to Toyota’s sales. Its second best-selling model is the Urban Cruiser Hyryder (55,102 units), followed by the Glanza in third position (45,338 units). The Fortuner SUV with over 29,393 units is ranked fourth. Kia India YoY sales up by 4 percent The newly Syros gave a considerable impetus to Kia's sales in the fourth quarter of FY2025 Kia India has ended FY2025 with total wholesales of 255,207 vehicles, which translates into a 4 percent growth year on year (FY2024: 245,634 units).  The FY2025-ending month of March 2025 was its best with 25,525 units. With the launch of the Syros compact SUV in early 2025, Kia India sees a surge in sales in the fourth quarter. The Sonet, which has outsold the Seltos for 15 straight months, is the new best-seller for the company, with an estimated total of 99,757 units. That’s 39 percent of Kia’s total wholesales in FY2025. Seltos’ sales of 72,729 units are down sharply by 27 percent YoY, while the Carens MPV took third spot on the product sales chart with wholesales of 64,712 units. Honda Cars India YoY sales up by 1.6 percent   Honda's growth was primarily driven by exports of the Elevate SUV. Honda reported cumulative sales of 1,26,151 units in FY2025 – up from 1,24,173 units in FY2024 – thereby recording a 1.6 percent year-on-year growth. While domestic sales reached 65,925 units (down by almost 24 percent year-on-year), exports climbed to 60,226 units, marking a 60 percent growth and the highest export volume in the company's history. It was primarily the Elevate SUV driving export volumes for the brand, while the new, third-gen Amaze launched late last year has also contributed reasonably to domestic volumes.
