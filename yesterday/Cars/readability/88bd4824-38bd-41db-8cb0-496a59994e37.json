  "description": "BMW has launched the updated M2 coupe in India, and its prices start at Rs 1.03 crore (ex-showroom). The M2 now gets more power, minor design tweaks, new colours and more tech. The updated M2 coupe is more powerful by 20hp It now does 0-100kph in 4 seconds; MT version takes 4.2 seconds  New colour options and new steering on offer  Updated BMW M2 now rated at 480hp BMW’s M division has ramped up the power and performance of the M2 as part of a series of changes for the model. It now comes with a more powerful version of BMW’s turbocharged 3.0-litre straight six, which makes 480hp, an increase of 20hp. Torque has also increased by 50Nm to 600Nm at 2,650-6,130rpm. With the updated engine, BMW claims a 0.1-second improvement in the 0-100kph time. The standard M2 Coupe with the 8-speed torque converter automatic gearbox now covers 0-100kph in 4 seconds, and the optional 6-speed manual model in 4.2 seconds. The effect of the extra power and torque is reflected more in the 0-200kph times, where both M2 models eclipse their predecessors by 0.6 seconds, with 12.9 seconds for the auto M2 and 13.7 seconds for the manual one. The top speed remains limited to 250kph, though this can be raised to 285kph with the optional M Driver’s package. The design remains largely unchanged, but the car now comes with an extended range of colours, including Sao Paulo Yellow, Fire Red, Portimao Blue and Skyscraper Grey. The standard M wheels feature a double-spoke design with a black finish and measure 19 inches at the front and 20 inches at the rear. The same wheels are available with a silver finish as an option.  Inside, the M2 Coupe receives a new flat-bottomed steering wheel with an optional Alcantara finish. The updated model also gets an new digital operating system with the latest-generation iDrive system. The M2 has no direct rivals in India. However, the Mercedes-AMG A 45 S hatchback comes close in terms of size and dynamics but is low on power at 421hp.
