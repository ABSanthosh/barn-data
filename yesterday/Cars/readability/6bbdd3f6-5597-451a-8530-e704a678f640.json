  "description": "This 1949 Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 is one of approximately 458 Super Sports built between 1939 and 1951 and is among a reported 63 examples of the SS variant clothed in Pinin Farina cabriolet bodywork during post-war production. Chassis 915756 is said to have left the factory in March 1949 before receiving its bodywork and being sold new in October 1950 in Lugano, Switzerland. The car later underwent a refurbishment between 1990 and 2010 and was purchased by the owning dealer in 2024. Finished in black over tan leather, it is powered by a replacement Super Sport 2,443cc DOHC inline-six that breathes through triple Weber carburetors and is mated to a column-shifted four-speed manual transmission. Additional features include chrome 17” wire wheels, hydraulic drum brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, and a beige convertible top. This 6C 2500 SS is now offered in Göttingen, Germany, by the seller on behalf of the current owner, a licensed German retail dealership, with documentation dating back to the 1980s and Swiss registration describing it as a 1953 model.",

The car later underwent a refurbishment between 1990 and 2010 and was purchased by the owning dealer in 2024. Finished in black over tan leather, it is powered by a replacement Super Sport 2,443cc DOHC inline-six that breathes through triple Weber carburetors and is mated to a column-shifted four-speed manual transmission. Additional features include chrome 17” wire wheels, hydraulic drum brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, and a beige convertible top. This 6C 2500 SS is now offered in Göttingen, Germany, by the seller on behalf of the current owner, a licensed German retail dealership, with documentation dating back to the 1980s and Swiss registration describing it as a 1953 model. The 6C 2500 emerged in 1939 as the final descendant in the progression of six-cylinder cars that Alfa Romeo started in 1928 with the 6C 1500. The model shared much of the preceding 6C 2300’s underpinnings but boasted an increase in engine displacement as well as the option of a triple-carbureted Super Sport variant. The steel ladder-frame chassis was produced in three lengths, the shortest belonging to the 2,700mm-wheelbase Super Sport. Bodywork was provided by various Italian coachbuilders throughout production, which continued into the early 1950s after limited wartime output. This example is said to have undergone a multiyear refurbishment between the 1990s and 2000s and is finished in black. Styling incorporates a narrow scudetto center grille flanked by rectangular inlets, glass-covered Carello headlights with frosted upper motifs, a centrally hinged hood, dual side mirrors, trafficators, pop-out door handles, and a beige convertible top that can be stowed under a matching boot. Bright wire wheels are secured by two-eared knock-offs and are wrapped in 6.50/7.00×17 Michelin Comfort Cord SS tires. The trunk houses a swing-out bracket for storage of a spare, although a spare is not present. Stopping is handled by four-wheel hydraulic drum brakes. The right-hand-drive cabin is trimmed in tan leather over bucket seats for two with matching upholstery over the door panels and kick panels. Color-keyed carpeting covers the floors and rear shelf, while additional equipment includes door pockets, a body-color dash that houses a glovebox with a Pinin Farina crest on its door, tinted visors, footwell vents, and a heater. The two-spoke steering wheel features a cord-wrapped rim and sits ahead of a column-mounted shifter. Jaeger instrumentation includes a 200-km/h speedometer with an inset clock and fuel-level gauge as well as a 6k-rpm tachometer with inset gauges monitoring oil temperature and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 5k kilometers (~3k miles), approximately 50 of which have been added under current ownership. A coolant temperature gauge has been added under the dashboard. The 2,443cc inline-six is a wider-bore evolution of the Vittorio Jano-designed powerplant used in the 6C 2300 and features an aluminum cylinder head with dual-overhead camshafts and hemispherical combustion chambers. With induction through triple Weber 36 DO2 carburetors, the Super Sport variant was factory rated at 110 horsepower. This example’s replacement engine is stamped with the number 928349, which falls within the range of a 1951 Super Sport. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission. Independent suspension comprises twin trailing arms with coil springs and hydraulic shock absorbers in cylindrical housings up front and a swing-axle rear end utilizing torsion bars and telescopic shock absorbers. The seller, a BaT Local Partner, offers shipping, importation, and titling support at an additional cost. Please inquire directly with the seller with questions about these services. The vehicle is being sold on its Swiss registration, which serves as an ownership document. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
