  "description": "This 1974 Porsche 911 Carrera coupe is one of 1,036 European-market examples produced for the year and was delivered new in Germany. In 2008, chassis 9114600911 was acquired by the manager of Centre Service Porsche Montélimar in France, where it underwent a refurbishment that involved a repaint in its factory shade of Light Yellow before being sold in 2010 and relocated to Paris. The fuel-injected 2.7L flat-six was removed and rebuilt in 2024 prior to the Swiss-based selling dealer's acquisition. Featuring Carrera-script graphics and flared rear fenders, the car rides on Bilstein shocks paired with 15″ Fuchs alloy wheels. Inside, the front seats are trimmed in black leatherette with blue Shetland fabric inserts and accompanied by a Blaupunkt radio. Shifting is through a five-speed manual transaxle, and further equipment includes 911 S–spec front calipers as well as front lip and ducktail rear spoilers. This MFI Carrera is now offered by the selling dealer in Geneva, Switzerland, with manufacturer's literature, French-language documentation from Porsche, an FIA laisser-passer, and a copy of Ryan Snodgrass's Carrera 2.7 book along with a French carte grise.",

In 2008, chassis 9114600911 was acquired by the manager of Centre Service Porsche Montélimar in France, where it underwent a refurbishment that involved a repaint in its factory shade of Light Yellow before being sold in 2010 and relocated to Paris. The fuel-injected 2.7L flat-six was removed and rebuilt in 2024 prior to the Swiss-based selling dealer’s acquisition. Featuring Carrera-script graphics and flared rear fenders, the car rides on Bilstein shocks paired with 15″ Fuchs alloy wheels. Inside, the front seats are trimmed in black leatherette with blue Shetland fabric inserts and accompanied by a Blaupunkt radio. Shifting is through a five-speed manual transaxle, and further equipment includes 911 S–spec front calipers as well as front lip and ducktail rear spoilers. This MFI Carrera is now offered by the selling dealer in Geneva, Switzerland, with manufacturer’s literature, French-language documentation from Porsche, an FIA laisser-passer, and a copy of Ryan Snodgrass’s Carrera 2.7 book along with a French carte grise. The car left the factory finished in Light Yellow (117) with flared rear fenders and was repainted as part of the aforementioned 2012 refurbishment. A front lip spoiler is paired with an aftermarket ducktail spoiler out back, and a retrofitted electric antenna, windshield wipers, and headlight washers have also been installed. Further details include black Carrera-script side lettering and a driver-side mirror as well as body-color headlight trim rings and impact bumpers. Silver 15″ Fuchs alloy wheels with black insets are wrapped with 185/70 front and 215/60 Pirelli P6000 tires that were reportedly mounted in 2024. The car rides on Bilstein shocks, and stopping power is provided by four-wheel ventilated disc brakes with 911 S–spec front calipers. An aftermarket front strut tower brace was added under previous ownership. The front bucket seats are upholstered in black leatherette with blue Shetland fabric inserts. A Blaupunkt radio was added in preparation for the sale, and further appointments include power side windows, opening rear-quarter windows, and a heated rear window. The three-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of VDO instrumentation that consists of a centrally mounted tachometer flanked by a 300-km/h speedometer, a clock, and gauges for fuel level, oil level, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 52k kilometers (~32k miles), approximately 300 of which have been added under current ownership. The selling dealer states that true mileage is unknown. The air-cooled 2.7L flat-six is equipped with Bosch mechanical fuel injection and sends power to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle. The engine was removed from the car and rebuilt in 2024. Photos of the engine rebuild process are presented in the gallery along with compression and leakdown test results and service records totaling over €23k since 2022. Following the engine work, the car received a 1st place award in the “Seventies” category at the 2024 Concours d’Elégance held by the Zürich Classic Car Association (ZCCA) in Switzerland. The trophy will accompany the car along with a tool kit, a tire inflator, and a space-saver spare. Manufacturer’s literature, an FIA laisser-passer, French-language documentation from Porsche, and a copy of Ryan Snodgrass’s Carrera 2.7 book are also included in the sale. The car has not been registered in Switzerland since it was brought to the country in 2024 from France. It will be supplied with a French carte grise. You are not connected to real-time updates.
