  "text": "This 2009 Ferrari 430 Scuderia was specified in Rosso Scuderia with tri-color stripes over black and red leather, and it has 11k miles. The car is powered by a 4.3-liter DOHC V8 paired with a six-speed F1 automated transaxle, and equipment includes bronze-finished 19″ Scuderia alloy wheels, an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, Brembo carbon-ceramic brake rotors, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, carbon-fiber-framed seats, a fire extinguisher, and automatic climate control. Purchased by its current owner in April 2019, this F430 Scuderia is now offered on dealer consignment with the owner’s manual, tools, and a Washington title. The exterior is finished in Rosso Scuderia with tri-color stripes, and additional equipment includes xenon headlights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, a rear diffuser, and dual exhaust finishers that exit through the rear valance. The Carfax report indicates that a May 2009 accident involving another vehicle resulted in damage to the rear-right corner. The selling dealer tells us that much of the car was repainted at that time. The rear window was replaced in September 2020. The bronze-finished 19″ Scuderia alloy wheels are mounted with older Bridgestone RE-71 Potenza tires. Braking is handled by red-finished brake calipers fitted over Brembo carbon-ceramic rotors. The brake fluid reservoir cap was replaced in March 2024. The cockpit features carbon-fiber-framed seats upholstered in black and red leather mounted over exposed diamond-plate aluminum flooring. Carbon fiber trims the console, door panels, and dashboard. Equipment includes automatic climate control, drilled aluminum pedals, and power windows and locks. A fire extinguisher is stationed in the passenger-side foot well. A portion of the headliner above the driver’s seat is damaged, and shrunken leather is evident on the dash. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel features an integrated LED shift light, an engine-start button, carbon-fiber shift paddles, and a manettino dial for control of dynamic settings. Instrumentation includes a central tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as a 220-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 11k miles, approximately 3k of which were added during current ownership. The mid-mounted 4.3-liter V8 features a flat-plane crankshaft, two overhead camshafts per cylinder bank, four valves per cylinder, and an 11.9:1 compression ratio. Output was factory rated at 503 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque in Scuderia trim. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed F1 automated transaxle and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential. According to the selling dealer, the differential solenoid was replaced and the oil pump was resealed in December 2020. The Carfax report shows the aforementioned accident. There is currently a lien out on the car, and the owner’s lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the next owner. You are not connected to real-time updates.
