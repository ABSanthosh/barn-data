  "description": "This 2019 Porsche 911 GT3 RS is finished in Lizard Green over black leather and Lizard Green Alcantara and was optioned with the Weissach Package, which reduced weight by utilizing a carbon-composite roof panel, front lid, anti-roll bars, and interior trim. Powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six paired with a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle, the car is equipped with the Sport Chrono and Light Design packages as well as a body-color Cantrell Motorsports roll cage, magnesium 20\" and 21\" center-lock wheels, carbon-fiber-backed bucket seats, a Bose surround-sound system, and LED headlights in black with PDLS+. Recently acquired by the selling dealer, this 991.2 GT3 RS has 6k miles and is now offered with a car cover, a battery tender, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Washington state title.",

Recently acquired by the selling dealer, this 991.2 GT3 RS has 6k miles and is now offered with a car cover, a battery tender, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Washington state title. The GT3 RS features lightweight glass, vented front fenders, and a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) front trunk lid and raised rear wing, and Weissach Package-equipped cars are denoted by the exposed carbon-fiber weave on these panels as well as a CFRP roof panel and carbon-fiber Sport Design mirror housings. This example is finished in Lizard Green and equipped with LED headlights in black with the Porsche Dynamic Light System Plus (PDLS+) as well as a front tow hook, a back-up camera, and LED taillights. Magnesium 20″ front and 21″ rear center-lock wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. The Weissach Package added carbon-fiber front and rear anti-roll bars and coupling rods, and standard GT3 RS equipment included rear-axle steering, Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus (PTV+). Braking is handled by red Porsche-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated discs. Carbon-fiber-backed bucket seats trimmed in black leather and Lizard Green Alcantara are mounted ahead of a Lizard Green Cantrell Motorsports roll cage. Further appointments include Schroth racing harnesses, “Weissach RS” headrest embroidery, a Bose surround-sound system, aluminum pedals, the Light Design Package, and PCM with navigation. The three-spoke Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel has a Lizard Green centering stripe and frames white instrument dials. The optional Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 6k miles. The 4.0-liter flat-six was factory rated at 520 horsepower and 346 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage and notes at least one manufacturer voluntary service action. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
