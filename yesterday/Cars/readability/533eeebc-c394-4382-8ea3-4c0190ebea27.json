  "description": "The Ford Bronco SUV line-up has been expanded with an all-new electric Bronco, which is set to make its global debut soon. This SUV is an all-new vehicle but borrows heavily from the design of the petrol-powered Bronco and Bronco Sport SUVs that have been on sale overseas for a few years. Christened the “Ford Bronco New Energy,” this SUV will come with pure electric and EREV (Extended Range Electric Vehicle) powertrain options. Ford Bronco EV has a 650km range (CLTC) Ford Bronco EREV to have around 1,220km range in total Ford Bronco New Energy dimensions The SUV is essentially a joint project between Ford and Jiangling Motors, which is Ford’s partner in China. In terms of dimensions, the Ford Bronco New Energy measures 5,025mm in length, 1,960mm in width, and 1,815mm in height, with a 2,950mm wheelbase. It has a curb weight of 2,630kg, making it a tad bigger than the full-size petrol-powered Ford Bronco SUV. However, both SUVs share the same 2,949mm wheelbase, according to data revealed on China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) website. The Ford Bronco New Energy is almost as long as the Kia EV9 electric SUV. Ford Bronco New Energy powertrain and battery More data revealed about the Ford Bronco New Energy indicates that the SUV will get an AWD dual-motor powertrain with a 177hp motor on the front axle and a 275hp motor in the rear, providing a combined output of 311hp and a top speed of 170kph. It comes equipped with a BYD-supplied 105.4kWh lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) blade battery, which is good for 650km CLTC range. The images also show a lidar unit above the front windshield, suggesting more advanced ADAS for the Bronco New Energy line-up. The second powertrain for the Ford Bronco New Energy is a plug-in hybrid setup, now called EREV. It comes with the same electric motor upfront as the pure EV variant, along with a smaller 245hp motor on the rear axle. There’s also a 1.5-litre petrol engine that delivers 150hp of power. Thanks to EREV technology, the petrol engine is not connected to the wheels and functions solely as a power generator for the battery or to support the electric motors. The Bronco New Energy EREV comes with a 43.7kWh battery, capable of providing a 220km range. Combined with the 1.5-litre petrol engine, the SUV can travel up to 1,220km. The Ford Bronco New Energy EREV’s curb weight is 2,510kg. Ford Bronco New Energy launch timeline The Ford Bronco New Energy will first go on sale in China and is likely to be sold in more markets in the future. Ford currently does not sell any vehicles in India but is likely to make a comeback with the Everest SUV. Meanwhile, Maruti is also currently working on EREV technology which it could introduce it in one of its mass-market products once the tech is ready for India.
