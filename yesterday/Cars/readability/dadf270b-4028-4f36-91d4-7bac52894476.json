The car was also optioned with the Visibility and Light Groups and has 14″ Magnum 500-style wheels, a Hurst shifter, a push-button AM radio, and Charcoal vinyl upholstery. Acquired by the seller in 2016, this AMX is now offered with a window sticker and a clean Massachusetts title in the seller’s name. Finished in Beale St. Blue with black over-the-top stripes, the car has faux hood louvers, a power-adjustable driver-side mirror, sail-panel AMX badging, and dual exhaust outlets. The seller notes that the left rear panel has been replaced. Magnum 500-style 14″ wheels are mounted with BFGoodrich Radial T/A tires. Braking is provided by front discs and rear drums. The car was optioned with the Handling Package and quick-ratio steering. The reclining bucket seats are upholstered in Charcoal Ventilaire vinyl, and interior appointments include woodgrain trim, a Hurst shifter, and a push-button AM radio. The wood-rimmed steering wheel has cracks and fronts a 140-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and a combination gauge for coolant temperature and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 86k miles, approximately 3k of which were added under current ownership. The X-code 390ci V8 was factory equipped with a four-barrel carburetor and rated at 315 horsepower and 425 lb-ft of torque when new. An optional heavy-duty cooling system was fitted from the factory. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a Twin-Grip limited-slip differential with an optional 13-41 gear ratio. The dual exhaust system is fitted with Flowmaster mufflers. Decoding the body plate reveals the following information: Body: R029139 – Kenosha assembly plant, sequential body number Model: 6939-7 – 1969 AMX Two-Door Sports Coupe Trim: 931F – Charcoal Ventilaire vinyl Color: P64 – Beale St. Blue Metallic The window sticker shows initial delivery to Dick Allen Motors in Inglewood, California, along with a total suggested retail price of $3,962.20.
