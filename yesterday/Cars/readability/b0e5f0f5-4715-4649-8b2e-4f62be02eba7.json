  "description": "Just three months after the second-gen Skoda Kodiaq made its India debut, the seven-seat full-size SUV is set to launch in India. Speaking to media at the Octavia RS drive, Skoda Auto India brand director Petr Janeba, confirmed that prices for the new Kodiaq will be announced in April, and that it will be offered in two trims. 2025 Skoda Kodiaq Sportline and L\u0026K prices to be revealed in April Second-gen Kodiaq gets the same 2.0-litre TSI petrol engine Kodiaq RS launch confirmed for end of 2025 2025 Skoda Kodiaq variants Kodiaq Sportline and Laurin \u0026 Klement trims to get cosmetic and feature differences The Sportline and L\u0026K on sale in international markets. Skoda will launch the 2025 Kodiaq in two trims – Sportline and Laurin \u0026 Klement (L\u0026K) – which will be differentiated on the outside and inside. Compared to the Kodiaq L\u0026K showcased at Auto Expo 2025, the Sportline trim is expected to feature blacked-out elements instead of chrome, such as around the grille, on the ORVMs, D-pillars and more, along with a different set of alloy wheels. The Kodiaq Sportline’s interior is also likely to mirror the exterior, with more blacked-out highlights and dark upholstery. Feature differences between the two trims are also likely, but we’ll have to wait for more details from Skoda for the specifics. 2025 Skoda Kodiaq engine details 190hp, 320Nm turbo-petrol engine, 7-speed DCT and AWD to continue 190hp, 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine from its predecessor. The second-gen Kodiaq is powered by the same 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine that powered its predecessor. Outputs were 190hp and 320Nm of peak torque, transmitted to all four wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. Skoda Kodiaq RS India launch details 265hp Kodiaq RS will be brought in as a CBU The Kodiaq range in India will expand with the range-topping RS-badged model before the end of 2025. Along with larger brakes and sportier design changes outside and in, the 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo-petrol engine has its outputs bumped up to 265hp and 400Nm of peak torque. Kodiaq Sportline and L\u0026K will be locally assembled Unlike the standard seven-seat SUV, which, as we had reported, is locally assembled, the Kodiaq RS will be brought in as a CBU and command a significant premium.
