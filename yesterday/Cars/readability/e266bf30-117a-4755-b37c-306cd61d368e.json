  "text": "Image: TeslaThe Tesla Cybertruck’s bed-mounted range extender came with a big size and an equally big price when the automaker finally released more details on it. Now after waiting over a year to know how much it’ll cost and how much range it’ll add, Tesla is changing things up for the worse. Not only will interested buyers have to wait longer for their range extenders, they won’t be getting as much added range as they thought. Suggested ReadingTesla's Cybertruck Has Finally ArrivedOffEnglishSuggested ReadingFirst spotted by Electrek, it seems Tesla has quietly updated the specs on the Cybertruck’s range extender. Originally, Tesla announced that owners of the tri-motor Cyberbeast would get an additional 120 miles of range and the standard dual-motor Cybertruck would get 130 miles of extra range. Tesla is slick and adds in the range extender’s range with the truck’s existing range to make the overall total more impressive. Now, the specs read 445+ miles for the dual-motor truck, 25 miles less than before. The Cyberbeast’s range stays the same with the standard all-season tires, but now Tesla mentions that will drop to 415+ miles if it’s equipped with all-terrain tires.Worse yet, interested buyers will now have to wait even longer for the range extender to go on sale. Originally Tesla said the it would be available in early 2025, but now it’s saying deliveries won’t be until mid-2025, which could mean late 2026 with how Tesla does things. One thing that hasn’t seemed to change is the range extender’s $16,000 price tag. Between the Cybertruck itself and this bed hogging range extender, doubling up on a bad idea of buying both doesn’t seem too smart.",
