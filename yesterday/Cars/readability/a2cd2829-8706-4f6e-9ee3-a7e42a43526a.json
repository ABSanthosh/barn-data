  "text": "The two thoroughly updated electric models will be inspired by the smaller ID.2 November 29, 2024 at 19:23 by Brad Anderson Volkswagen is shifting its design focus to better compete with rivals like Tesla’s Model Y. The updated ID.3 and ID.4 will adopt a fresh design inspired by the ID.2 concept. The company is also responding to criticism by re-introducing buttons to its interiors. Volkswagen is readying a raft of improvements for the ID.3 and ID.4 that won’t just overhaul their designs, but also introduce new interiors and improvements to their underpinnings. While the ID.3 and ID.4 were among the first truly compelling EVs from the VW Group in their respective segments, sales haven’t exactly met expectations. When the ID.3 launched in 2019, some believed it could challenge the dominance of the Tesla Model Y. Evidently, that didn’t happen, and part of the reason is likely the design language of VW’s current ID models. Fortunately, things are set to change, with design inspiration now coming from the upcoming ID.2, which was previewed by a concept last year. A New Look, A New Direction During a recent interview with Auto Express, Volkswagen’s development boss, Kai Grünitz, confirmed that both the ID.3 and ID.4 will benefit from the brand’s new design language. “We will bring a re-skin for the ID.4 and ID.3, with a completely new design language going back to where we originally came from, from a design perspective, and return to what Volkswagen is known for,” he said. This means ditching the somewhat ambiguous styling of current ID models in favor of a more coherent and recognizable aesthetic. Leading the charge is VW design head Andy Mindt, whose new approach embraces a cleaner, more defined two-box silhouette that should help give the ID. models a clearer identity. Read: VW Dials Back Touchscreens, Rediscovers Physical Buttons In addition to the new looks, Grünitz hinted at more practical improvements, too. “We also have a lot of improvements in terms of battery costs and performance, we will also bring new features and driver assistance functions,” he added. “So there will be a huge improvement, both in terms of the cost for us, but also benefit for the customers.” Translation: better range, improved performance, and a host of new tech aimed at making the ID.3 and ID.4 more attractive to buyers VW ID.2all Concept Interior Overhaul: Goodbye, Cheap Plastics If you’ve ever spent time in an ID.3 or ID.4, you’ll know the interiors can feel a bit… cold, to put it mildly. VW seems to have taken the hint. Customers will be pleased to know that VW is working to make its cabins nicer. The new interior design direction was also previewed by the ID.2all concept and added more physical buttons and switches. One of the key features of the concept was its row of physical switches for the climate control, neatly positioned below the central infotainment display. The British magazine also mentioned that VW will make several quality improvements to the cabins of the ID.3 and ID.4. In September, Mindt revealed that the brand plans to ditch cheap plastic materials and will instead use more fabrics. When Will the New ID.3 and ID.4 Arrive? As for when you can expect these refreshed ID. models to hit showrooms, Volkswagen is staying tight-lipped. The cars might not land until 2026, but given the current pace of the EV market, that’s probably just the right amount of time to make these updates matter. The interior of the ID. 4 GTX",
