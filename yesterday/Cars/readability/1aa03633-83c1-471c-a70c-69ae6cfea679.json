I first saw this particular 1999 FD in May when it was on display at Wekfest Japan 2024. At the time, the engine wasn’t quite finished, so I made plans with Masatsuga Chiba of X-Point Import Co., who played an important role in its recreation, to shoot the Mazda later in the year. I was keen to take a closer look and discover which direction this 25-year-old beauty had been taken. Like anything that’s stood the test of time in popular culture, certain formulas tend to get repeated. Take the Mont Blanc cake, for example – it’s been a favourite since 1915, and over the years, many great recipes have been developed. Step into any patisserie, anywhere in the world, and you’ll find a pile of chestnut vermicelli topped with whipped cream, resting on some kind of pastry or sponge base. But to find one that achieves the perfect balance of bitter, sweet, and texture – that’s an entirely different story. Much like the Mont Blanc, most nostalgic tuner cars built today follow a time-tested recipe. There’s nothing wrong with that – these tried-and-true combinations of parts and styling cues tend to work well together. I’m guilty of it myself, having opted for a WRC wide-body kit on my own blue and gold GC8 Impreza. Typically, FD RX-7 builds in Japan follow an expected formula: custom side-porting, a big single turbo, a v-mount intercooler setup, and a body kit from TCP Magic or RE Amemiya. It’s a recipe that consistently delivers a tough-looking and fast street car. But the question is – do any of these builds truly have a soul? But what is it that gives a car its soul? Perhaps it’s tied to the owner, or maybe it’s a token of authenticity – like a set of 30-year-old wheels or a vintage wing – that gives the car a sense of history and character. Seiya Inazu‘s RX-7, finished in the stunning Nouvelle Blue Pearl (a second-generation Honda NSX colour), has gone above and beyond the typical formula. It’s more than just another JDM FD3S; it’s the automotive equivalent of a gourmet Mont Blanc, the kind you might expect to find in Heston Blumenthal’s fridge. Interestingly, a Honda S2000 provided much of the inspiration for Inazu-san’s creation. Inside, the car has been thoughtfully upgraded with plenty of suede. On top of all the expected aftermarket additions – including Bride XERO CS seats, a Renown x RWB steering wheel, Defi gauges and a BattleCraft shift knob – it possesses a level of comfort that almost feels like it was part of the factory’s design. Outside, the combination of a RE Amemiya aero and a Scoot Sports vented bonnet gives this FD an aggressive, almost Dodge Viper-esque look. But the real magic happens under that hood. Sure, you can throw a bunch of tuning parts at any FD’s 13B-REW twin-turbo engine and expect a certain result – it’s a recipe found on countless Instagram feeds. But making it all fit together in a way that’s both functional and beautiful is another challenge entirely. This 13B was originally modified by Mochi Racing and features custom side-porting, a giant HKS GTIII-4R turbocharger, Trust/GReddy v-mounted intercooler, a titanium exhaust system from Car Shop Glow, and more. However, it was later torn down and rebuilt at X-Point, who also handled the wire tuck and shaved the engine bay using a custom harness from Rywire Motorsport Electronics. That harness supports the Ignition Project ignition system upgrade (with R35 coil packs) and the Link G4X engine management system. The wheels are Desmond Regamaster EVO IIs all around, much like those on the 97GT car I shot a few weeks back. It’s clear the owners of both FD3S RX-7s followed a similar recipe. If I were to compare the two cars – which are both brilliant in their own right – I know which one I’d drive home. But what about you? Toby Thyer Instagram _tobinsta_ tobythyer.co.uk",
