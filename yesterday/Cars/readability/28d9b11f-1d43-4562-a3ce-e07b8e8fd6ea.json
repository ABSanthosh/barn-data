  "text": "The value of an object isn’t always measured in monetary terms, as Arnaud Cailly learned when his workshop was broken into—and his beloved Kawasaki KLX300 stolen. “That Kawa wasn’t worth much, but it meant a lot to me,” he recalls. “I kept it in good shape for the occasional ride with my dad.” Arnaud runs Le Cent Vingt Cinq out of Thoiry, a town just west of Versailles, France. He started the workshop during the COVID-19 pandemic, when France’s lockdown prevented him from working as a physiotherapist (his main source of income). Le Cent Vingt Cinq has grown to a three-man team over the last few years. And although they’ll customize just about anything, they have a particular proclivity for pre-2000s Japanese motorcycles. Although the workshop’s tools were also stolen during the robbery, the loss of the KLX400 left a small adventure bike-sized hole in Arnaud’s heart. “A few months later, I stumbled upon a super clean 1993 Suzuki DR350 online and snapped it up right away,” he tells us. “Around the same time, Fuel Motorcycles announced Scram, a 10-day off-road adventure in Morocco. No stock bikes allowed—every motorcycle has to be custom-built. I pitched the idea to my dad and brother and, before we knew it, we were all in.” In no time, the Suzuki DR350 had gone from being a replacement for Arnaud’s lost KLX400 to a full-blown custom scrambler project. First, he turned to 2R14 Design to help him turn his vision into a digital render. Then he began sourcing the parts needed to bring it to life. First to go was the DR350’s OEM fuel tank. The Le Cent Vingt Cinq modified a 1974 Husqvarna CR250 tank to replace it, topping it off with a knurled filler cap. The intricate paint job was handled by Rob Art-Custom, with inspiration taken from the North African Berber culture. Next, the crew fabricated new fenders for the front and rear, plus a new subframe to accommodate the Suzuki’s new bench seat. They made the crash bars too—but retained the original side covers, which were painted to match the tank. The DR350’s big hoops were swapped out for a set of 18” Excel rims, finished in a champagne gold hue. They’re wrapped in chunky 120-section Maxxis tires. Arnaud admits that the smaller hoops might not be ideal for off-roading, but he’s happy with the compromise—and besides, there are plenty of off-road-focused mods elsewhere. The crash bars bear a pair of LED spotlights, while a burly sump guard protects the belly of the beautifully refinished engine. Le Cent Vingt Cinq also specced it with gigantic foot pegs and a rear brake caliper protector. Up top you’ll find a set of customized enduro bars with a welded-in cross brace, wearing new grips, pared-down switches, and Beringer controls. The twin headlights were lifted from a Honda Zoomer (the Japanese version of the Ruckus), before being retrofitted with a guard and a luggage rack. “It gives me that Baja racing vibe,” says Arnaud, “but it also has space for a blanket, made by my friend Camille at The Wild Whispers.” Other mods include a Motogadget speedo and neatly integrated Highsider LEDs for the turn signals and taillight. The exhaust uses a custom-made header with a Triumph-specific Ironhead muffler, and the suspension has been overhauled with new springs and oil. Then there’s the leopard-print suede seat cover, and the subtle gold details that echo the rims. Nicknamed ‘Dune,’ Arnaud’s Suzuki DR350 scrambler ticks two major boxes; it’s fun and it’s capable. “Dune isn’t just a show bike—it’s built to ride,” he adds. “Now, I just can’t wait to take it to Morocco.” Le Cent Vingt Cinq | Facebook | Instagram | Images by Julien T.
