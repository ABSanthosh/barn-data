  "description": "Audi has silently delisted the A8 L sedan and RS 5 Sportback from their India website. The Audi A8L and the RS 5 were brought to India as completely built imports (CBUs) and their last recorded price was Rs 1.63 crore and Rs 1.13 crore (ex-showroom), respectively. We have reached out for an official statement, but Audi India is yet to revert. Audi A8L: a brief recap The last iteration of the A8 L was launched in July 2022, which was a facelift of the fourth-generation model. The A8 was available in long-wheelbase guise in India, as is the favoured choice in this segment, and in 4- and 5-seat configurations. It was powered by a 340hp, 3.0-litre, turbo-petrol V6 engine with quattro all-wheel drive. With Audi having vacated the flagship limousine segment, this space is now left to just the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7 Series/i7. Mercedes and BMW's flagships have consistently outsold Audi’s A8. Globally, too, the A8 is towards the end of its lifecycle, while the S-Class and 7 Series are fresher products. The next-generation A8 will likely be an electric-only model, but its launch is likely some time away. Audi RS5 Sportback: a brief recap The Audi RS5 Sportback was launched in August 2021, and it came powered by a 450hp, 2.9-litre, twin-turbo V6 engine. The A5 line-up in India, in fact, could only be had in one of the two sporty iterations – RS5 or S5; the latter is still on sale. The RS5 was also pleasantly practical as it came as a 4-door Sportback unlike the 2-door coupe form of its predecessor. Like the A8, the RS5, too, is towards the end of its lifecycle. The A5, on which the RS5 is based, has moved on to its next generation overseas and already has an S5 variant in the line-up; an all-new RS5, therefore, can be expected to join the family soon. In the meantime, Audi is gearing up to launch the RS Q8 facelift in India on February 17, and you can read more about it here.
