  "description": "This 1969 Shelby GT500 is one of 245 convertibles produced for the model year, only two of which were specified in Grabber Green with black bucket seats and a four-speed manual. It was built on April 1, 1969, with subsequent delivery to Ogden Ford of Ogden, Utah. Between 1994 and 2004 Primus founder and bassist Les Claypool owned the car, which then underwent seven-year restoration at Cobra Automotive of Wallingford, Connecticut, that was completed in 2011 and included an overhaul of its 428ci Cobra Jet V8 and the transmission as well as redoing the exterior, white soft top, and interior. The car features high-back front bucket seats, a Shelby-specific center console, a roll bar, and an AM/FM stereo along with a Traction-Lok 9\" rear end, power front disc brakes, power steering, 15\" Shelby wheels, Koni shocks, Lucas fog lights, a Ram Air intake assembly, a four-barrel carburetor, and a dual exhaust system with headers and an H-pipe. Acquired by the selling dealer from the Carroll Collection of Jackson, Michigan, in 2021, this GT500 convertible is now offered with a Shelby shop manual supplement, service and refurbishment records, historical ownership documents, copies of the Shelby American invoice and order form, a reproduction window sticker, a Deluxe Marti report, and a clean Michigan title.",

It was built on April 1, 1969, with subsequent delivery to Ogden Ford of Ogden, Utah.

The car features high-back front bucket seats, a Shelby-specific center console, a roll bar, and an AM/FM stereo along with a Traction-Lok 9″ rear end, power front disc brakes, power steering, 15″ Shelby wheels, Koni shocks, Lucas fog lights, a Ram Air intake assembly, a four-barrel carburetor, and a dual exhaust system with headers and an H-pipe. Acquired by the selling dealer from the Carroll Collection of Jackson, Michigan, in 2021, this GT500 convertible is now offered with a Shelby shop manual supplement, service and refurbishment records, historical ownership documents, copies of the Shelby American invoice and order form, a reproduction window sticker, a Deluxe Marti report, and a clean Michigan title. The body is finished in Grabber Green (Z) with white side stripes and features 21 fiberglass panels including the front fenders, trunk lid, and hood, the latter of which is equipped with five NACA-style ducts and quick-release latches. The exterior is further outfitted with a power-operated white convertible top, Lucas fog lights, color-keyed racing mirrors, quarter-panel scoops, an integrated tail spoiler, chrome bumpers, and rectangular center-exit exhaust outlets. The soft top and the windshield were replaced in 2011. Paintwork is detailed in refurbishment records that accompany the car, and close-up photos that show finish flaws can be viewed in the gallery. Five-spoke 15″ Shelby wheels were mounted with 225/60 front and 245/50 rear BFGoodrich Radial T/A white-letter tires in 2004, and it has the Competition Suspension package with Koni shocks at all four corners. The steering is power-assisted, as are the front disc and rear drum brakes. The upper control arms, ball joints, bushings, and shaft along with the brake booster, the axle bearings, and the lower control arm assembly were replaced during the refurbishment between 2004 and 2005. The cabin features front bucket and rear bench seats that have been reupholstered in black vinyl, while the carpeting is protected by matching Cobra-logo floormats. Woodgrain trim accents the dashboard and door panels, and additional interior details include a Shelby-specific center console with a storage compartment, a padded armrest, and toggle switches for the dome and driving lights as well as a roll bar. The three-spoke woodgrain steering wheel fronts an 8k-rpm tachometer, a 140-mph speedometer, and gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. Oil-pressure and amperage gauges located on the console ahead of the shifter are canted towards the driver, and a clock is mounted on the right side of the dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows 82k miles, a handful of which were added by the selling dealer. The 428ci Cobra Jet V8 was rebuilt by Cobra Automotive of Wallingford, Connecticut. It is equipped with a Ram Air intake assembly, a rebuilt four-barrel carburetor and distributor, and ribbed aluminum valve covers. Long-tube headers flow into a dual exhaust system equipped with an H-pipe, dual resonators, and a single transverse-mounted muffler with dual outlets, the latter of which was replaced in 2004. Output was factory rated at 335 horsepower and 440 lb-ft of torque. Power is transferred to the rear wheels by way of a Centerforce dual friction clutch assembly and release bearing, a rebuilt Toploader close-ratio four-speed manual transmission, and a 9″ rear axle with a Traction-Lok differential and 3.50 gears. The Deluxe Marti report lists an April 1, 1969 production date and initial delivery to Ogden Ford of Ogden, Utah, along with factory colors and equipment and production statistics.
