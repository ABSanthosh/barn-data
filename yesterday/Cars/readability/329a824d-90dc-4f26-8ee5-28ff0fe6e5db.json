  "text": "And the best news is that the creator is ready to let someone take it off his hands 1 hour ago by Stephen Rivers A genius in the UK built his own personal VW Porsche mashup, and it’s a stunner. Beneath a 1967 Beetle skin you’ll find a 1997 Porsche Boxster with a flat-six engine. This one-of-a-kind creation is for sale, priced at £23,500, or around $31,000. A lot of car enthusiasts love to tweak and customize their rides, but not everyone gets it right. There’s a whole graveyard of projects that went off the rails. We’ve documented plenty of projects gone wrong. But today, we’ve got a rare gem, a project where the vision and expertise actually came together in perfect harmony. More: This Isn’t A 1968 Mustang, Even If It Looks Like One Meet Uno, a 1967 Volkswagen Beetle sitting on top of a 1997 Porsche Boxster. Classic good looks combined with modern driving dynamics. It’s the kind of build that makes you think, “Why didn’t anyone think of this sooner?” Modern Performance Meets Classic Charm “I Always had a soft spot for a Beetle but hated the way they drive so I built this,” says builder Linden Lee. The Boxster proved to be the perfect foundation as the wheelbase and floor pan were close enough that Lee didn’t have to drastically change the shape of the Bug to fit. The body is all steel rather than fiberglass or another composite. He’s also fitted it with a ragtop, rear pop-out windows, custom engine intakes, and a custom exhaust. The suspension includes coilovers and strut braces. 19-inch wheels sit at each corner with 305-section width tires at the back. A modified Toyota Supra ducktail spoiler sports a Porsche wordmark, as does the lower valence. Those features really hit at what makes this build so great. The more modern Porsche bits still work, including the ABS, cruise control, power steering, power seats, and gauges. More Than Enough Power, Really While Lee doesn’t have a current dyno chart, the 1997 Boxster originally came with 201 horsepower (149 kW) and 181 lb-ft (245 Nm) of torque. No, it’s not going to win any drag races against today’s hyper-fast machines, but for a car like this, it’s more than enough. And considering that the Bug’s body is probably lighter than the original Boxster, the power-to-weight ratio should be a huge improvement. That means better performance all around, even if it does sacrifice that classic Beetle feel. Lee is selling Uno for £23,500, or about $31,000 USD. For that, you get a car that’s got the timeless charm of a Beetle, but with modern performance that actually works. It won’t crush any drag races, but it’ll certainly turn more heads than your typical project car.
