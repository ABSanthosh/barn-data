  "description": "Bentley has revealed a dramatic, high-riding limousine concept previewing the brand’s future design language for the EV era. Dubbed the EXP 15, this does not preview a specific model per se, but design details from this concept could make it to future production Bentley EVs. It’s strictly a design exercise, but one that completely discards traditional Bentley design cues seen on the existing models. EXP 15 concept is merely a design study Features a 3-door body with three interior seats Also debuts Bentley new logo Measuring 5.4meters in length, the EXP 15 straddles the boundaries between a sedan, an SUV and a grand tourer. The proportions are imposing, and it takes inspiration from one of the earliest Bentley GT cars – the 1928 Speed Six with bodywork by coachbuilder Gurney Nutting, more popularly known as the Bentley Blue Train. This car has an interesting story, go Google it. Bentley EXP 15 concept exterior design When viewed head-on, it almost does not appear like a Bentley at all and is a bit ostentatious, if you will. The iconic circular headlights are gone, and instead, there are new slimline vertical LED units. Speaking to our sister publication, Autocar UK, newly appointed design director Robin Page said, “The point is to make a bit of a bang”. Sounds very Jaguar-like. One detail that has been retained, though, is the diamond motif for the grille, of course, sealed off and backlit here. The other defining design element is the very upright face, which Page says is inspired by the heritage cars “which had a strong vertical element.” The endless bonnet line is a key feature, too, and what’s really cool about the long bonnet is that it houses a luggage compartment that’s accessed via side-hinged panels on the top. The new Bentley logo, concealed in a glass casing, and the Flying B motif have also been tweaked. In profile is where the monolithic design of the EXP 15 is most apparent. It’s high-riding and has a cab-rear silhouette and heavily accentuated rear arches. This being a concept, there are cameras for mirrors, striking dual-tone wheels with aero blades, and an air vent aft of the front fender with a two-part illuminated LED strip. The window line, in particular, is again a hark back to the Speed Six, with Page describing it as a “direct lift”. At the rear, again, all traditional Bentley design elements, including the beautiful oval tail-lamps, have been sacrificed for a look that could belong to any EV concept, frankly. The C-shaped LED strips for the tail-lights look generic, but what looks cool is the two-part spoiler with movable aero flaps. Bentley EXP 15 concept interior design Getting inside the EXP 15 is an interesting affair because it’s not a traditional 4-door coupe. It’s only a 3-door model, as the rear door on the driver’s side has been given a complete miss. And likewise, on the inside, there are only three seats because the front passenger seat has been eliminated – all these quirks because Bentley says its passengers “prefer either driving themselves or [to] lounge at the back.” The space vacated by the front passenger seat can instead be used to mount a cradle for one’s pets. Yes, Bentley has even designed a bespoke dog carrier to fit that spot. If that’s not indulgent enough, the rear seats even swivel out 90 degrees when the rear-hinged rear door opens, for a more “elegant exit”. Even the central section of the roof opens up when parked, so that passengers can stand before getting out. The concept also has picnic seats and a champagne cooler in the tailgate. As for the dashboard itself, Bentley’s signature winged design has been retained with some repositioning and reinterpretation of the screens. The instrument cluster is just a slim digital band; there’s a screen on the passenger side, too, and at the centre, there’s a small digital display that displays the state of charge, among other functions. But the real highlight is that there are plenty of physical buttons and dials on the centre console, the steering wheel and even the door pads. Page said, “We’re finding that, especially at our end of the market, people are a bit bored with full-digital screens. What makes us premium is to keep a good level of mechanical detailing that the others can’t do.” Thankfully, logic finally seems to be prevailing.  Bentley EXP 15 concept technical details The EXP 15 is strictly a concept for now, and no battery, power or range details have been revealed. And given its brick-like shape, aerodynamic efficiency doesn’t seem too much of a concern either. Page even remarked, “We’re finding that there’s a sweet spot in terms of range. Our customers are basically telling us that 300-350 miles is that sweet spot. Beyond that, they’ll use the private jet.” Range and efficiency are concerns for more pedestrian EVs, perhaps. It's not unusual to see such outlandish concepts, especially from luxury carmakers, as they try to reinvent themselves for the EV era. The Jaguar Type 00 was a classic example. However, as a pure design showcase coming from a very traditional British marque, the EXP 15 concept does seem to lack some character and even appears almost Chinese-like. Before giving the green light, though, Bentley will closely monitor reaction to the EXP 15 concept in order to gauge the viability of offering a high-riding sedan in this vein. After all, this is meant to reimagine the dying sedan breed for the future. Meanwhile, the first all-electric Bentley, which will be in an SUV body style, is due for a debut sometime in 2026, and it remains to be seen how much and which of these design elements will finally make it to production. The upcoming Bentley EV will not replace any existing model, but it will slot in a place now left empty by the Mulsanne limousine.
