It is powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six paired with a six-speed manual transaxle and is finished in black over black leather upholstery. Equipment includes the Chrono Package, 20″ GT3 center-lock alloy wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes, a limited-slip differential, a front axle lift system, a black soft top, a carbon-fiber twin-hump convertible-top cover panel, LED headlights with PDLS, carbon-fiber full bucket seats, Porsche Communication Management with navigation, a Bose surround sound system, automatic climate control, an Escort Max Ci 360 radar detector, and a speed-activated rear spoiler. A Porsche six-year service was completed in May 2025. This 911 Speedster was recently acquired by the selling dealer and is now offered at no reserve with a build sheet, the owner’s manual, a car cover, Porsche Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) warranty documents, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean California title. The Speedster shares styling cues with the 991 GT3 including a similar front splitter and bumper covers, while features unique to the Speedster consist of a shorter windshield, a manually retractable black soft top, and a body-color carbon-fiber twin-hump convertible-top cover panel. This example is finished in black and has LED headlights in black with PDLS, a speed-activated rear spoiler, dual exhaust outlets, and carbon-fiber mirror caps and window triangles. Paint protection film has been applied to the front end, per the seller. Center-locking 20″ forged alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin tires. Braking is handled by four-wheel cross-drilled Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes with yellow Porsche-branded calipers. Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), Porsche Stability Management (PSM), and rear-axle steering were standard on the Speedster, and this example was optioned with a front-axle lift system. The brake fluid was flushed in preparation for the sale. The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are upholstered in black leather with “Speedster” script on the headrests and contrasting deviated stitching that extends to the dashboard, steering column, center armrest, and door panels. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include Porsche-branded floor mats, a Bose surround sound system, the Light Design Package, carbon-fiber illuminated door sill guards, Porsche Communication Management with navigation, dual-zone automatic climate control, and cruise control. An Escort Max Ci 360 radar detector was installed in 2020. A serialized plaque located between the seats denotes this example as #1,560 of 1,948 Speedsters produced. The leather-wrapped steering wheel features a yellow centering stripe and frames a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline along with a 225-mph speedometer along with gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The Chrono Package adds a stopwatch to the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 2,200 miles. The naturally aspirated, GT3-sourced 4.0L flat-six features VarioCam Plus valve timing and was updated for the Speedster with revised individual throttle bodies and high-pressure fuel injectors. Factory rated power output was 502 horsepower and 346 lb-ft of torque. The car last passed an emissions inspection in December 2024. A May 2025 six-year service and inspection performed by Porsche Newport Beach in Costa Mesa, California, is detailed on the associated records provided in the gallery. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The car is equipped with an optional 23.7-gallon extended-range fuel tank. The build sheet shows factory colors, optional equipment, and a Total Retail Price of $308,815. The Carfax report lists at least one open recall. You are not connected to real-time updates.
