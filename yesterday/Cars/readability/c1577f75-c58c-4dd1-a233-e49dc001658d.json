Although officially billed as a concept, the production version will look virtually identical. A new set of exclusive images taken on the shores of Lake Como shows what we might as well call a two-door M8 Touring with completely bespoke bodywork.The German luxury automaker is taking a page from Rolls-Royce’s coachbuilding book. After last year’s targa-topped Skytop, the follow-up shooting brake is also a two-seater but with far more room in the back.

Is it worth the massive premium over an M8? That’s debatable, but we’re sure it won’t take long before the entire production run is spoken for. After all, BMW found buyers for all the Skytops, though that model had a shorter run of just 50 units.Both special projects are M8s underneath the skin, so it’s no surprise the cars feature the older iDrive system. We do appreciate the separate physical controls, instead of cramming everything into a touchscreen. While the exterior has a real shot at becoming a timeless design, the cabin will inevitably age due to the dual-screen setup. That’s how the cookie crumbles with modern technology.Some of the ultra-rich probably would’ve wanted more variety at this exorbitant price. We can only imagine how much more desirable the Speedtop would have been with analog dials and no tablet jutting out of the dashboard. A manual gearbox is equally a pipe dream, though wealthy purists would’ve flocked to the car had it come with a stick.
