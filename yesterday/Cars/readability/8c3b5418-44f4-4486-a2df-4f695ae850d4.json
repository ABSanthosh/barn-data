  "text": "Published:  July 2nd, 2025 “World’s most powerful tidal turbine.” The Orbital O2 2 MW is an innovative floating tidal turbine platform. Developed to address climate change by producing clean, renewable electricity. Equipped with large blades, it harnesses energy from tidal currents, directing the flow into power-generating cells to create sustainable energy. According to Orbital, a single O2 unit can generate up to 2.5 megawatts of power. Enough to supply electricity to approximately 1,700 homes in the U.K. each year. With a length comparable to a 747 Jumbo Jet, the O2 is a colossal structure. It features two foldable 59-foot legs, each equipped with 32.8-foot-long blades to maximize energy capture. Could this groundbreaking technology become a global standard for clean energy production? Your Future Machine is your go-to destination for cutting-edge technology, transportation, and innovation.
