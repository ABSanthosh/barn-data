  "text": "This 1996 Acura NSX-T has remained registered in California through the seller’s acquisition in 2020, and it is powered by a 3.0-liter VTEC V6 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Finished in Berlina Black over black leather upholstery, the car has 17″ and 18″ O.Z. Racing wheels, Swift lowering springs, a Taitec exhaust system, a limited-slip differential, a removable body-color roof panel, pop-up headlights, power-adjustable seats, automatic climate control, cruise control, and a Bose sound system. This NSX-T is now offered at no reserve with the owner’s manual, service records, spare parts, a car cover, a battery tender, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The NSX featured aluminum bodywork, and this example is finished in Berlina Black with a body-color removable roof panel. Exterior details include pop-up headlights, window tint, an integrated rear wing, side air intakes, power-adjustable side mirrors, and dual exhaust outlets. The front bumper cover has been refinished, and paint protection film has been applied to the front end. A paint imperfection is noted on the left-rear quarter panel, and paint meter readings are provided in the gallery. The 17″ and 18″ O.Z. Racing Ultraleggera wheels are mounted with Kumho tires. The car features a four-wheel double-wishbone suspension with front and rear stabilizer bars as well as Swift lowering springs, and braking is handled by NSX-branded calipers over vented rotors at each corner. The removed set of wheels is included in the sale. The cabin features power-adjustable sport seats upholstered in black leather, while NSX-branded floor mats line the footwells. Interior appointments include automatic climate control, cruise control, a Bose sound system, a cassette stereo, and a Bluetooth module. The stainless-steel door sill plates are stamped with the car’s serial number. Blemishes on the passenger seat are highlighted in the gallery. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a tachometer with 8k-rpm redline, a 188-mph speedometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 70k miles, approximately 8k of which were added under current ownership. A mileage inconsistency is listed in a September 2024 entry of the Carfax report, which notes that it may be a result of a “clerical error.” The mid-mounted 3.0-liter V6 features VTEC variable valve timing and was factory rated at 270 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. A timing belt service was performed in 2018, and work since June 2024 included changing the oil in addition to replacing the coolant hoses, air filter, and battery. The car passed an emissions inspection in March 2023. Power is routed to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. A Taitec exhaust system has been fitted, and a Science of Speed clutch and flywheel kit was installed in September 2024. The removed exhaust system is included in the sale. The owner’s manual, spare parts, service records, a car cover, and a battery tender are included in the sale. The Carfax report shows the aforementioned mileage inconsistency.
