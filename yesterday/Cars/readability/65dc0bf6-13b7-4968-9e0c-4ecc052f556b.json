Equipment includes polished 17″ and 18″ lightweight alloy wheels, the Memory Package, pop-up headlights, dual-zone climate control, cruise control, a head-up display, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, a Bose sound system, and a CD stereo. This C5 Z06 is now offered in Texas with a window sticker, service records, a spare set of wheels, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The C5 Z06 was only offered as a fixed-roof coupe for increased chassis stiffness and featured a quad-exit titanium exhaust system, mesh grille inserts, and weight-saving measures such as thinner glass and reduced sound deadening when compared to the standard C5. This example is finished in Torch Red and features pop-up headlights, Z06 fender badges, and rear brake vents. Polished 17″ and 18″ lightweight alloy wheels are mounted with Goodyear Eagle F1 tires. The Z06 suspension featured a larger front stabilizer bar, increased damping, and a higher spring rate than the standard Corvette. The car is equipped with active handling and traction control systems, speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion power steering, and ventilated disc brakes at all four corners. A spare set of 17″ and 18″ lightweight alloy wheels is included in the sale. The cabin features two seats upholstered in black leather. Amenities include a six-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, a head-up display, dual-zone automatic climate control, an onboard computer, cruise control, electrochromic mirrors, and a Bose sound system with an in-dash CD player. The rear-view mirror and vanity mirror lights do not work, and the passenger’s door lock cannot be operated via the key fob. The leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a 200-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline along with gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 8k miles, approximately 6k of which were added under current ownership. The 5.7-liter LS6 V8 was based upon the contemporary LS1 and features a refined aluminum block, a higher-lift camshaft, a 10.5:1 compression ratio, and increased air and oil flow. Factory-rated output for the 2002 model year was 405 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. The engine bay lamp needs to be replaced. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual gearbox and a limited-slip differential. The window sticker lists initial delivery to De Nooyer Chevrolet in Albany, New York, along with factory equipment, colors, and a total vehicle price of $51,535. The Carfax report is free from accidents or other reported damage. Interested to see what Car and Driver thought about the Corvette Z06 when it was new?
