  "description": "Photography by: Johnathan Rothman (@thejohnrothman) 1956 Jaguar XK140 Convertible Raced in period by Briggs Cunningham and Denise McLuggage Location: California, USA Country of original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: S818207 Mileage: 76,025 miles Colour: Red Original colour of delivery: Carmine Red Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer a unique collector-grade Jaguar. The Jaguar XK140 represented the epitome of front-mounted 6-cylinder Jaguars in the mid-1950s. This particular example is without a doubt the most storied one in the United States of America, as it was raced and campaigned by two of the most prolific personalities in the American racing world. The car was first campaigned by renowned Briss Cunningham, who was indisputably one of the most pivotal figures in postwar sports car racing, making a profound impact as a driver, team owner, and constructor. Briggs then proceeded to donate his XK140 to Denise McLuggage, an American auto racing driver, journalist, author and photographer. She pioneered gender equality in motorsports and journalism in the U.S., and was among the very first women taking part in professional automotive racing. Her racing achievements included winning the grand touring category at Sebring in a Ferrari 250 GT in 1961, and a class win in the Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Falcon in 1964. She also participated in the NÃ¼rburgring 1000 km sports car race. This car's past is in fact so fascinating that it recently enabled it to earn a very coveted spot in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (MSHFA), where it resided in 2022 alongside other giants of the racing world. What's perhaps even more remarkable, is that the car presents in unaltered condition. It's been kept 'as-is' by its 4 owners (Briggs Cunningham, Denise McLuggage, and 2 other owners, including the present one), and is showing a splendid amount of patina. Everything about this car is original and has remained untouched over the last 58 years - the chassis, body panels, engine, transmission, suspension, wheels, seats, dashboard materials, and more, are all original. And, magically, 58 years later, it still elegantly runs and drives. Continue...",
