The car has remained registered in California from new, and it was previously listed on BaT in June 2024 before being acquired by the current owner later that year. This Diablo VT Roadster has 17k miles and is now offered on dealer consignment in Florida with a Carfax report and a clean California title. The Marcello Gandini-designed Diablo underwent a mid-cycle refresh for 1999 and received fixed composite headlights sourced from the contemporary Z32 Nissan 300ZX. This car is finished in Giallo Super Fly and has a removable hardtop that stores above the engine compartment as well as fog lights, scissor doors, and a rear wing. The right mirror housing was repaired and painted in 2019, and the windshield wiper motor was replaced in 2021. Rock chips and paint flaws are shown in the gallery below, including imperfections on the rear bumper cover, left door, and headlight trim. The Maya 19″ and 20″ wheels have black centers and yellow lips and are mounted with 235/35 front and 345/25 rear Pirelli P Zero Rosso tires. The car has a front-axle lift system and an adjustable suspension. Stopping power is provided by multi-piston Brembo calipers over cross-drilled rotors. The front shocks were rebuilt and the bushings were replaced in 2019. The cockpit houses fixed-back bucket seats trimmed in black leather with yellow piping and stitching that extends to the door panels and dashboard. Equipment includes dual airbags, automatic climate control, and an Alpine stereo with an in-dash CD changer. The air conditioning system was recharged in 2021, and the driver-side door handle and door shock were replaced in 2019. The leather-wrapped steering wheel is paired with a dogleg-pattern gated shifter and frames a 220-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 7,500-rpm redline, and auxiliary gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, oil temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 17k miles, approximately 200 of which have been added under current ownership. The 5.7-liter V12 has been fitted with twin superchargers and a Borla exhaust system that are said to have been installed by Platinum Motorcars in the early 2000s. The car most recently passed a California emissions test in March 2023, however, various aftermarket engine components installed are not CARB-compliant. A supercharger belt was replaced in 2013, while the oil pan was repaired in 2015. Power is routed to all four wheels via a five-speed manual transmission, front and rear limited-slip differentials, and a Viscous Traction all-wheel-drive system. The underside was blasted with dry ice in preparation for the sale, according to the selling dealer. The Carfax report notes that the car was designated a Gross Polluter by the state of California in 2003 and twice in 2005. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
