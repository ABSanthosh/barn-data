  "description": "First organised by Autocar India in association with Mercedes-Benz in 2014, the Mercedes-Benz Classic Car Rally (MBCCR), now in its 11th edition, has grown to become the gold standard for vintage and classic car rallies the world over. Having revived and encouraged interest in vintage and classic Mercedes-Benz’ in India, MBCCR has created a vibrant community of both seasoned and renowned vintage and classic car collectors and restorers as well as a younger generation of enthusiasts who are taking their first steps into the world of Mercedes-Benz classics. Some of the special cars that have graced the event since its inception include publisher Viveck Goenka's S-Class collection, Pratapsinh Gaekwad's 230SL Pagoda, Gautam Singhania's 300S Adenauer Cabriolet, Yashvardhan Ruia's 1929 Nurburg, HH Yuvraj Himanshu of Gondal's 300 SL, and the 300Sc Roadster from Pranlal Bhogilal’s famed collection. This year, with over 60 cars set to participate in the traditional classes (E-Class, S-Class, SL-Class) and a slew of exciting new classes on the cards, the rally promises to be bigger and better than ever. The new classes include the Bruno Sacco class, celebrating the life and work of the iconic Italian designer; the Supercharged class that includes the original Kompressor series from the 1930s with cars like the 500K, 540K, and 630K; the Superlimousine class, including the Nurburg, 600 Grosser and multiple variants of the 300 Adenauer series; the 40 Years of the iconic 124 series that celebrates the quintessential modern classic that spearheaded Mercedes-Benz’ official entry into India and the Modern Classic car movement globally; and the Mile Muncher class, a special showcase of the cars that drive down from faraway locations just to be at MBCCR. The last category has participants driving down from Goa, Lucknow, Kochi and Rajkot, to name a few. There is also a special ‘Tribute to Motorsport’ class that will have a number of tribute cars at the event. Another exciting addition to this year’s event is the travelling showcase of Mercedes-Benz classics that will visit Chennai, Kochi and Goa, giving enthusiasts the chance to get up close to these works of automotive art in their hometowns. This series will be called the Mercedes-Benz Classic Car Showcase. Participants from these three cities will also be ceremonially flagged off at the showcase events. True to MBCCR’s legacy, this year is poised to draw bigger audiences and even more classics to the streets of Mumbai, reminding us all of the sheer passion and romance of Mercedes-Benz classics.
