  "text": "Like a connoisseur of fine wine, art, or vintage vinyl, every Ducati Monster enthusiast has an era they swear by. For Tony Prust at Analog Motorcycles, it’s the mid-2000s—specifically, the Ducati Monster S2R 1000. “I cut my teeth customizing my own 2007 Ducati Monster S2R 1000, back when I started getting into motorcycle customization,” Tony tells us. “I tailored bits and pieces like belt covers, lowered the dash and headlight, and actually sold some of those modifications to other Monster owners. That bike was also the first one I fully took apart to powder-coat loads of parts.” Tony’s love affair with the Ducati Monster S2R 1000 came full circle when a client asked him to build the ultimate air-cooled Monster. “He has a couple of modern bikes, but wanted something simple to rip around town on,” says Tony. “The air-cooled models certainly help to keep things simple, both aesthetically and mechanically.” A low-mileage Monster S2R 1000 was sourced for the project. The client had two specific requests; he wanted to retain the stock fuel tank, and he wanted a swish set of custom wheels on the bike. Everything else was up to Tony. “He was willing to let me have creative freedom to tailor it how I would if it were mine,” he tells us. “Since I prefer to build riders, I built it as if I planned to ride it a lot; upright handlebars, some room in the seat to get comfortable, and all the things you would need to make it a daily rider if desired.” Tony’s first task was to add some flair to the Monster’s fuel tank without ruining its classic lines. He fabricated a pair of small tank fairings that not only look great, but also direct air to the rear cylinder. Next, the subframe was modified and the iconic Ducati trellis frame was de-tabbed. A new seat pan and rear hump were fabricated, before regular Analog co-conspirator, Dane Utech at Plzbeseated, topped it off with elegant upholstery. The Monster’s new bodywork is different enough to set it apart from the stock bike, but not so outlandish that it ruins the S2R’s classic appeal. Moving to the chassis, Tony added new fork cartridges and an upgraded rear shock, both from Matris Dampers. As per the client’s request, a gorgeous set of spoked wheels was ordered from Jonich Wheels in Italy, specced with black and bronze finishes. The plan was to carry the same color scheme through to the rest of the Monster—but since the wheels were being custom-built, Analog had to be patient. Luckily Jonich sent over a set of paint samples, so that the team could tackle the rest of the finishes with zero guesswork. The frame, forks, swingarm, and a handful of other bits, were all sent to Southern Powdercoating for a bronze chrome finish. Krossover Customs laid down a tasteful silver, black, and bronze livery over the bodywork. The remaining parts were done in black—save for the engine, which was repainted in the original silver hue by Apex Cycles. With 95 horsepower from the Monster’s 992 cc motor, there was little need for internal upgrades. Instead, Analog modified the air box, installed a K\u0026N filter, and built a new exhaust system with Cone Engineering mufflers. Ceramic coated in black by Loko Performance, the asymmetrical exhausts reportedly sound as rowdy as they look. “I always wear earplugs when I ride,” says Tony. “That may not be most people’s go-to, but I’d recommend it in this case.” A Microtech ECU was added next, before the bike went off to Mark Sutton (formerly of Ducshop) for a tune. The Monster also employs a Ducabike six-spring slipper clutch and slave cylinder, with a billet aluminum clutch cover from TPO. Going deeper, Analog built an all-new wiring loom around a Motogadget control box. The cockpit features Rizoma handlebars, Magura controls, Motogadget switches, and Vortex grips. A tiny Motogadget speedo sits atop the upper bar clamp, complete with a row of LED idiot lights. CRG bar-end mirrors round out the package. For lighting, Tony picked an LED headlight from Speed Moto Co. and mounted it on custom-made brackets. The front turn signals are from Analog’s in-house brand, Analog Motor Goods, while the rear units are from Highsider. A Denali LED taillight is neatly embedded into the back of the tail bump. Finishing touches include a Vortex fuel cap, Spiegler brake hoses, and CNC Racing rear-set foot controls. Tony has a gift for balancing form and function, and he’s used it to great effect with this Monster restomod, by amplifying both its timeless style and its rideability. “It’s a super fun bike to ride and rip around back roads on,” he adds. “It has a ton of torque—like a properly tuned Monster should.” Analog Motorcycles | Facebook | Instagram | Images by Steve West",
