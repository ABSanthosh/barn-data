  "text": "Parked outside the Harley-Davidson museum in Milwaukee is a bronze statue of one of the Motor Co.’s most influential racers—’Smokey’ Joe Petrali. Joe was a force to be reckoned with in the 20s and 30s, competing in everything from dirt- and board-track racing to hillclimb events. But he’s best known for the motorcycle land speed record he set in 1937. Joe flew across the sands of Daytona Beach at 136.183 miles per hour, setting a record that stood for over a decade. His bike was a factory special from Harley-Davidson—a 61 cubic inch overhead valve Knucklehead with streamliner bodywork and no rear suspension. The story goes that the bike’s tail fairing made it unstable in initial runs, so Joe removed it and eked out a win. Joe’s legacy was the inspiration behind this svelte 1973 Harley Shovelhead, built by Minoru Watanabe at Fatech in Tokyo, Japan. The brief called for a 1970s Harley with 1930s style—so Watanabe-san ruminated on what a 70s Joe Petrali special could look like. Minoru kicked things off with a hardtail frame from Paughco, which he modified extensively. The steering neck was lowered and tilted, the rear axle plates were shortened, and the tubes were massaged to create a super-sano silhouette. Going even deeper, Minoru shrunk the area around the Shovelhead motor, eliminating any vacant air above the cylinder heads to emphasize the classic V-twin power plant. He narrowed the frame underneath the seat, too, before filling the space with a handmade oil tank. The ribbed effect on the oil tank was created by hand, using a technique called reverse curving—a process that took Minoru 60 hours. The engine itself benefits from a Dynatek Dyna 2000 ignition, new cams, and an S\u0026S Cycle Super E carb with a classic teardrop air cleaner. It exhales via a pair of slash-cut drag pipes, sporting a signature Fatech mod: a change in diameter at the midsection of each pipe that improves torque and creates a deeper rumble. Power is sent to the back wheel via an open 3” belt primary drive and a chain final drive. Lowered Harley-Davidson Wide Glide forks do duty up front, connected to a 21” wheel wrapped in Avon rubber. A 16” Firestone-shod wheel sits out back. Both wheels wear covers inspired by Joe Petrali’s Daytona Beach bike. The rear wheel covers are off-the-shelf items, but the front covers had to be made from scratch. Rather than simply slap a flat aluminum disc onto each side of the wheel, Minoru took the time to hammer an elegant convex shape into each half. The split gas tanks are his handiwork, too. Designed as slimmer versions of vintage Harley reservoirs, the two halves are separated by a handmade center strip that also hosts a recessed Motogadget speedo. Minoru fabricated the center section with a rib down the middle of it, carrying that theme through to the bespoke rear fender. This Shovelhead is dripping with clever details. The pleated seat, upholstered by Atelier Cherry, is notched at the back to expose the fender’s rib. And the rear fender brackets incorporate a mounting system that makes them appear as if they’re floating. Fatech handlebars adorn the cockpit, cut down to help the Shovelhead’s owner navigate Tokyo’s crowded streets. The risers and switches are also Fatech products, while the foot controls are custom parts that use modified vintage pegs. A clutch pedal and jockey shifter sit on the left-hand side of the bike. Finishing touches include a chromed headlight, and a rare B.L.C. Taillight from the 30s. Then there’s the work you can’t see—like the color-coded cloth-wrapped wiring that Minoru treats all his vintage builds to. The lush green paint job was handled by Minoru’s client, who just so happens to be an experienced automotive painter. Minoru called in regular collaborator Shakin’ Speed Graphix to do the pin stripes and details, including the sharp tank graphics. Dubbed ‘Galaxy Bullet,’ Fatech’s Harley Shovelhead boasts miles of hot rod style while skillfully blending some of Harley-Davidson’s best eras.
