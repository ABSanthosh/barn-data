  "text": "To be clear, EVs do not work, for anyone. The batteries fail after 3 weeks, there is no place to charge them, there is no way to generate electricity for them, the electricity is too expensive, parts fall off, they don't sound right, not enough range, too expensive, not kid friendly, no place to charge them, the batteries fail after 3 weeks and they don't sound right. They don't work now, they won't work ever. They do not work in any part of the world. No one wants them; no one has ever wanted them. They will not ever get better, they will stay very worse. ICE is healthy and nutritious. Head gaskets are a blessing. The best car companies in the world do not use electricity for propulsion in any form not ever never. If they did, the vehicles would be dreadfully slow, and expensive, and no place to charge them, and the batteries fail after 3 weeks, and they don't sound right. Not enough range, parts fall off. Not kid friendly. Internal combustion engines are improving at an incredibly fast rate.",
