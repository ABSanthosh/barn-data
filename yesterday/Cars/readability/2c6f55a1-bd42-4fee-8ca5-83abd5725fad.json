Called the X Gran Coupe and X Gran Convertible, these niche model derivatives boast unique design elements and aim to expand the Genesis lineup in the future.  Both concepts resemble G90 donor limousine Built on short-wheelbase configuration of halo car Get 415hp 3.5-litre V6 petrol engine with mild hybrid system What is the Genesis X Gran concept? Fifth prototype from brand X Gran is the fifth concept from Genesis after the New York, GV80, Essentia and Mint. First showcased in 2021, the concept series presents the brand's vision for a sustainable and luxurious grand tourer cars featuring the signature Two Lines design.  Genesis X Gran coupe and convertible design Signature twin-lightbar design Both concepts closely resemble the G90 limousine and feature twin-lightbar design up front and at the rear. “The reasoning behind [the concepts] is making derivatives of the G90 which share the same platform, so it is cars that could be integrated into the lineup,\" Genesis design boss Luc Donckerwolke said at the show.  Frameless doors look production ready Previewed by the Genesis X concept, the 2025 coupe and convertible models retain their two doors; the G90 sedan has four doors. The frameless pair of doors with flush handles looks near-production ready, which may hint at what the road-ready version will look like. Aside from confirming that the cars use the short-wheelbase configuration of the G90 platform, the luxury carmaker did not state any dimensions. For G90 dimensions as a reference, see the table below. Genesis G90 short wheelbase dimensions (in mm)Length5275Width1930Height1490Wheelbase3180 Genesis X Gran coupe and convertible interior Crystal accents on key controls Over the standard G90, the X Gran concepts get crystal accents on the steering wheel, air vents and the centre console. The luxury positioning is further reflected in the aluminium-spoked steering wheel, screens embedded into the rear of the front headrests and the use of microperforated olive wood. The convertible also gets a cloth roof with varying grape colours inside and out. Genesis X Gran coupe and convertible powertrain Not fully electric as previously reported While it was earlier reported that the X Gran cars will have an all-electric powertrain, Genesis has borrowed the existing G90’s 3.5-litre V6 petrol engine with mild-hybrid tech for the concept car duo. Maximum power output is 415hp, which comes at 5,800rpm. Genesis India launch May arrive with SUV Hyundai has been evaluating bringing the Genesis brand to India, as Autocar India has previously reported. It may initially bring an SUV as a full import, with the Genesis GV80 being the strongest contender, backed by a design patent filing in the country.
