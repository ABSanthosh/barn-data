Now showing 34k kilometers (~21k miles), the car is finished in Tobago Blue Metallic and is powered by a 5.6-liter S70 V12 linked with a six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential.

Additional equipment includes 17″ Style 5 wheels, hidden headlights, power-adjustable front sport bucket seats trimmed in black and Tobago Blue leather, and dual-zone automatic climate control. This E31 is now offered on dealer consignment in California with a Montana title in the name of the current owner’s LLC. The 850CSi featured revised front and rear valances and circular quad exhaust tips when compared to other E31 models, and European-market units received tinted front corner lenses in addition to M-design side mirrors. This example is finished in Tobago Blue Metallic (256) and features hidden headlights with washers. Photos of paint meter readings are viewable in the gallery below. Cross-spoke 17″ Style 5 alloy wheels are mounted with 235/45 front and 265/40 rear Hankook Ventus S1 evo tires. The CSi features a lower ride height with stiffer springs and dampers compared to the standard 850, and European-market examples were equipped with larger 13.6″ floating front brake rotors as well as Active Rear-Axle Kinematic (AHK) rear-wheel steering. The power-adjustable front sport bucket seats and individual rear seats are upholstered in black leather with Tobago Blue inserts and are joined by color-coordinated door panels and carpets. Wood trim accents the cabin, and amenities include driver’s seat position memory, dual-zone automatic climate control, an onboard computer, a radio block-off plate, and power windows and locks. A four-spoke steering wheel frames a 300-km/h speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. The digital odometer shows 34k kilometers (~21k miles). The 5.6-liter S70B56 V12 features Bosch Motronic fuel injection and an engine oil cooler. Factory-rated output was 375 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The car has not passed a California emissions test.
