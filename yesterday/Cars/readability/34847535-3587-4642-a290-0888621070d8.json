Sure, it is wildly impractical and bonkers to look at, but that’s the locus of its appeal – and your author is totally on board. In other words, you’ll find no Slingshot slander in this post.This model has actually been around for a decade, even if some jurisdictions (ahem, where I live, ahem) are only now getting around to properly classifying the thing and permitting its registration at the DMV. For ’25, Polaris has gifted the Slingshot reworked front end styling, new audio gear, and a skiff of improved drivability. The latter is said to come courtesy of upgrades under the hood, where engineers infused a few more horsepower and broadened the torque curve for greater response. The automatic transmission has also been given some new tuning, said to smooth out the driving experience. This guy hopes to sample it for himself later this year and compare it to an older model tested a couple of years ago, particularly those changes to the transmission. Dampers also get a retune this year. Power comes from a Polaris-developed 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making a base 180 horsepower or 204 ponies in the SLR an R, all sent to that 20-inch single rear wheel. It is hooked to either a manual or automatic transmission.Front-end styling gets a tweak, adding a (useful) inch of ground clearance and a slicker appearance. Headlamps in the American market look straight out of Batman, especially when paired with lower accent lights and a center light bar. None of it is necessary, all of it is awesome (which could be the Slingshot’s marketing tagline – Polaris, if you’re listening). Trims range from the S through to the SL and SLR before topping out with the R. Gonzo paint selections assure extroverts will get the attention they desire. See 100 Photos of the 2025 Polaris Slingshot As for the cabin and assorted comforts, Polaris says the 2025 models get new audio options including a thumping system from Rockford Fosgate complete with a yaffle of speakers and ample bass. Small refinements like a decent automotive-grade keyfob and a tethered fuel cap are responses to customer feedback. There’s more storage in here than ya might think, by the way, including a pair of cubbies behind each seat which are more than big enough for helmets or groceries, though not really both at the same time.The 2025 Slingshot lineup will begin shipping to dealers in March.[Images: Polaris]Become a TTAC insider.
