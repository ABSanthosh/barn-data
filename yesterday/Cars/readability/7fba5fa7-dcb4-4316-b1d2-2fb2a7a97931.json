  "text": "If you, like us, find yourself staring through bleary eyes while attempting to take in the hundreds of live auctions on BaT, our Weekly Weird and Wonderful feature is for you! Every Friday, we take a little time to call out some of the most unique, important, and strange vehicles on our pages. This is by no means a comprehensive list—there are far too many highlights to feature them all. But that’s what our make and model directory and live auctions page are for! Here are the ten listings that stood out to us this week, plus a few honorable mentions. 1. 4,500-Piece Hot Wheels Scale-Model Car Collection This collection of 4,500 Hot Wheels came along just a little too late for Christmas, but it makes us smile nonetheless. We still have a hard time leaving the local megamart without a couple of Hot Wheels in our basket, and this is what it might look like if one did that consistently for 40 years—while somehow possessing the restraint to keep them in the packaging. We definitely share VW_Kafer_Mensch’s sentiment below. 2. Dodge Charger “Chi-Town Hustler” Funny Car Re-Creation This Dodge Charger funny car was commissioned by Mike Minick, Pat Minick’s grandson, and is a replica of the car built and driven by the elder Minick and his teammates, John Farkonas and Austin Coil. The original Chi-Town Hustler was part of the first wave of “funny cars,” and stalked drag strips around the country in the late 1960s and early 1970s operating on a shoestring budget consisting mostly of match race winnings. Long, smoky burnouts were a Minick signature, and the tribute car here should have no problem replicating them, powered as it is by a supercharged 426ci Hemi V8 with an Enderle “bird-catcher” fuel-injection system, Dart heads, and “zoomie” headers. The seller estimates output to be around 1,000 horsepower, and though the car was built as a “cackle car” for nostalgia drag meets, it’s equipped for full-strip runs once the engine has been run in. We imagine that would look and sound a little like this. 3. 1916 Harley-Davidson 8-Valve Boardtrack Racer Board track racing was one of the first popular motorsports in America in the early 20th century, and looking at this 1916 Harley-Davidson display bike makes it readily apparent that it was not a pursuit for the faint of heart. No brakes, no clutch—just an eight-valve V-twin (with exposed valvetrain) and a chain driving a single sprocket at the rear wheel. Controls are limited to a throttle and handlebars. We’re guessing that, once started, the only way off would be crashing or fuel starvation. Can you imagine piloting a bike like this at 100 mph on a road made of rattling 2x4s? 4. 1932 Franklin Airman Custom Phaeton Franklin was a prewar automaker based out of Syracuse, New York, and found their niche selling sporty, air-cooled cars with the endorsements of prominent aviators like Charles Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart. Even on BaT they don’t come around often, and this 1932 Airman wears a custom phaeton body that was fabricated by Enfield Auto Restoration of Connecticut in the early 1980s. This wood-wheeled wonder is full of tricks, from its air-cooled inline-six to its adjustable armrests and hinged rear windscreen. It’s a fantastic reimagining of a model that never existed in period. 5. 1998 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am Coupe #00001 “GM Project Gold Rush” 6.3L 6-Speed This 1998 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am coupe was born as a test mule for GM Engineering Development, and has the honor of being the first production Firebird outfitted with the then-new LS1 engine. Not too many years later, it was modified and became “Project Gold Rush,” a GM promotional vehicle celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Trans Am. Though it’s spent its fair share of time on display, this ‘Bird should know how to fly—its LS1 was bumped up to 6.3 liters and kitted out with a Lunati rotating assembly, Lingenfelter heads, and other goodies. 6. 1998 Suzuki Carry Pickup 4WD 5-Speed w/2001 Vespa ET2 Practical luxury—that’s what this listing says to us. The Vespa is a “Coach Edition,” in case its 600 Coach logos didn’t make that clear. And like a nice handbag, it’s not something you want to set on the ground—hence the inclusion of the complementary 4WD Suzuki Carry pickup, with its adorable retro-styled front end. As @Vespa74 notes, this combo rings up at four cylinders between the two vehicles. 7. 1954 Chevrolet Bel Air Dirt-Track Race Car The opening line of the listing copy tells a hard-luck story in Hemingway-esque fashion—this car “was built for dirt-track racing and used in competition in Georgia before being retired and stored in a field.” Thankfully, this grizzled old-timer is ready for action once more. It’s even registered for street use! Vintage dirt track racing is very much a thing, and hearing this beast at idle makes us want to see it sliding sideways on a banking made of Georgia clay. 8. 318-Powered 1957 Plymouth Belvedere 2-Door Hardtop For John Carpenter’s 1983 movie adaptation of the Stephen King novel Christine, main character Arnie Cunningham’s 1958 Plymouth Fury was upgraded to a two-door Belvedere. The car went on to wreak havoc in the fictional suburb of Libertyville, Pennsylvania, killing several people and reconstructing itself through sheer force of evil despite being nearly destroyed. Now it’s 2025 and…she’s back, right here on BaT. This tribute wears some gold accents not found on the original Christine, and features a cool FP31 318ci polyspheric V8 with dual Carter WCFB four-barrel carburetors. 9. Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula 1–Style Simulator The crazy thing about this simulator is that it’s one of two—its companion in Martini livery is parked just to the left, and the seller says it will be going up on BaT soon as well! We’re sure iRacing with this rig is fantastic, but we’d love to take it for a spin on the Rainbow Road. 10. 32k-Mile 1984 Lincoln Continental Valentino Edition In the 1980s, oil magnates flaunted their wealth and power on daytime TV and Lincoln sought to keep their upscale image while downsizing their offerings, as seen in this bustle-back, Valentino edition Continental sedan. The redesigned Continental was based on the Fox platform from 1982-87, which means that this somewhat stuffy saloon is packing a 5.0 V8 that is certainly capable of making far more than the 140 horsepower it wheezed out in factory trim. It was hard to keep our list down to just 10 vehicles. Here are a few honorable mentions of note: Honorable Mention: 1977 Porsche 911S Coupe Sportomatic In this week’s edition of the BaT Podcast, Alex and Keith Martin shared their thoughts on Porsche’s Sportomatic transmission, which was a rarely-selected option on longhood 911s and even rarer on later impact-bumper cars. Honorable Mention: 10k-Mile 2000 Saturn LW2 Wagon Saturn’s midsize L-series was only built for five years, but sold in numbers over 400,000 during that time. These were workaday vehicles, typically used more like appliances, so it’s neat to see a well-preserved example with low mileage. Honorable Mention: 34-Mile 1976 Cadillac Eldorado Convertible Just 34 miles? Those Duke boys must be halfway to heaven by now… That’s it for this week’s edition! Like we said, this list is by no means comprehensive; there are many more weird and wonderful vehicles on our pages at any moment. We’d love to hear what caught your eye! Let us know in the comments.",
