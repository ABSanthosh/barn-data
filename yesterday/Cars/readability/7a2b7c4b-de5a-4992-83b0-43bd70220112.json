  "description": "This 1994 Porsche 911 is one of a reported 754 Turbo 3.6 examples produced for the model year, and it shows 32k miles. The car has spent most of its time in Florida, and it was purchased by the seller in August 2023. The turbocharged 3.6-liter flat-six was removed from the car and overhauled in July 2024, at which time the rod bearings, valve guides, rocker arms, intake and exhaust valves, and timing chain tensioners and ramps were replaced. The car is finished in Amazon Green Metallic over tan leather, and shifting is through a five-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes multi-piece 18\" Speedline wheels, Bilstein B6 dampers, a TechArt fog light and brake duct kit, a power sunroof, a fixed rear spoiler, a Fabspeed Motorsport exhaust system, power-adjustable front seats, air conditioning, a Blaupunkt stereo, carbon-fiber interior trim, drilled aluminum pedals, and a 993-spec shift knob and handbrake grip. This 964 is now offered in Florida with a tool kit, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title in the name of the seller's LLC.",

The car has spent most of its time in Florida, and it was purchased by the seller in August 2023. The turbocharged 3.6-liter flat-six was removed from the car and overhauled in July 2024, at which time the rod bearings, valve guides, rocker arms, intake and exhaust valves, and timing chain tensioners and ramps were replaced. The car is finished in Amazon Green Metallic over tan leather, and shifting is through a five-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes multi-piece 18″ Speedline wheels, Bilstein B6 dampers, a TechArt fog light and brake duct kit, a power sunroof, a fixed rear spoiler, a Fabspeed Motorsport exhaust system, power-adjustable front seats, air conditioning, a Blaupunkt stereo, carbon-fiber interior trim, drilled aluminum pedals, and a 993-spec shift knob and handbrake grip. This 964 is now offered in Florida with a tool kit, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title in the name of the seller’s LLC. The 964 Turbo featured widened bodywork when compared to the contemporary 911 and was fitted with aerodynamic side mirrors and a fixed rear spoiler. The 3.6-powered variant was introduced in January 1993, and this example is finished in Amazon Green Metallic. Features include a power sunroof, fog lights, and an aftermarket front spoiler. The seller tells us that a TechArt fog light and brake duct kit has been installed, and the nose has been repainted. The multi-piece 18″ Speedline wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires, which show date codes from 2016 and 2017. The Turbo features uprated brakes compared to the standard 964, including larger calipers and cross-drilled rotors at each corner. Bilstein B6 dampers have been added, and the brake pads were replaced in preparation for the sale. The cabin features power-adjustable front seats trimmed in tan leather along with a color-coordinated dashboard, door panels, and carpets. Amenities include air conditioning, a Blaupunkt stereo, carbon-fiber trim, a TechArt drilled accelerator pedal, drilled aluminum brake and clutch pedals, and a 993-spec shift knob and handbrake grip. The four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a central tachometer with a 6,800-rpm redline as well as a 180-mph speedometer and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, oil level, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 32k miles, approximately 150 of which were added during current ownership. The turbocharged 3.6-liter flat-six was factory rated at 355 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque, and a Fabspeed Motorsport exhaust system has been added. An engine-out service was performed in July 2024 by Orbit in Riviera Beach, Florida. Work included a valve job and replacing the following components: Timing chain tensioners and ramps Cylinder head bolts Rod bearings Valve guides Intake and exhaust valves Camshaft oil-feed pipe Camshaft woodruff key Rocker arms Oil-pressure sensor Fuel filter Intake manifold gaskets Gaskets and O-rings Belts Spark plugs and wires Battery Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle. The clutch slave cylinder and shifter coupler and bushings were replaced in July 2024. Decoding the option sticker reveals the following information: L39A – Amazon Green Metallic LG – Cashmere leather seats with black dashboard C02 – Version for USA 586 – Power lumbar support, left seat 650 – Power sunroof 718 – VIN for next model year 935 – Supple leather rear seats 980 – Supple leather front seats The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
