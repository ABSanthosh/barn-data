  "text": "A student team built a Vellfire-inspired Lexus with minivan styling, big wheels, and custom touches July 19, 2025 at 21:01 by Thanos Pappas NATS college revealed their latest student-built projects for the Tokyo Auto Salon. One standout build is a Toyota Vellfire-inspired sedan based on a Lexus LS. The V8 and eight-speed automatic transmission are expected to remain stock. What if a familiar minivan took on a sedan form? That’s the question students at NATS (Nihon Automobile College) are exploring by turning a Lexus into something inspired by the Toyota Vellfire. Rather than relying on digital renderings, the team has taken a hands-on approach, building the vehicle from the ground up. More: Tiny Dakar Kei Truck Built Around A Suzuki Jimny Is Utterly Adorable The Toyota Vellfire Sedan is one of three unique projects being prepared by NATS students for this year’s Tokyo Auto Salon. Alongside it, they’re also working on a restored Nissan Gloria transformed into a lowrider and a mini-Supra Spider crafted from a Daihatsu Copen. All three builds are already underway, with the goal of completing them in time for the show this December. A Lexus Base with a Vellfire Twist Among the trio, the Vellfire Sedan stands out thanks to its unusual blend of sedan proportions and minivan styling cues. The base is a Lexus LS460, part of the fourth-generation lineup that was produced between 2006 and 2017. It’s a full-size luxury sedan, now serving as the foundation for something far less conventional. The plans is to add the LED headlights of the Toyota Vellfire on the Lexus, alongside a custom front bumper with a large grille and sporty intakes. The biggest challenge will be to merge the minivan’s lightning units with the fenders of the sedan, but judging from previous NATS projects, the students have everything they need to achieve their goal. NATS The side profile will be reworked with a set of 21-inch wheels from WORKS and a lowered stance made possible by air suspension. Around back, slimmer full-width LED taillights will mirror those of the Vellfire, joined by a subtle ducktail spoiler and a revised bumper design. As for the interior, it will gain a fresh white upholstery, likely combined with a tech upgrade including modern infotainment and audio systems. More: Toyota Alphard Minivan Converted Into A Dually Pickup For Tokyo It is not clear if NATS will opt for any mechanical modifications other than the air suspension. The donor vehicle is fitted with a naturally-aspirated 4.6-liter V8 generating 375 hp (280 kW / 381 PS) and 493 Nm (364 lb-ft) of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission, a setup that’s likely to remain untouched. NATS is expected to release more images and videos as the build progresses, leading up to its official debut at the Tokyo Auto Salon. We’ll be keeping an eye on the updates and will share more as the project comes together.",
