  "description": "This 2007 Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano was initially delivered to Ferrari of Houston in Texas, and it is powered by a 6.0-liter F140 V12 paired with a six-speed F1 automated transaxle. Finished in Rosso Rubino Micalizzato over beige leather upholstery, the car is equipped with a limited-slip differential, 20\" Challenge alloy wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes, bi-xenon headlights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, rear parking sensors, carbon-fiber Daytona-style seats, a Sony head unit, a Bose sound system, a K40 Calibre front and rear radar and laser detector system, rear luggage straps, and dual-zone automatic climate control. The current owner acquired the car in 2022 and has since added approximately 1k of the 33k miles. This 599 GTB Fiorano is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner in Wisconsin with a window sticker, the owner's manual, service records, spare parts, a factory Ferrari car cover, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Nevada title in the name of the owner's trust.",

Finished in Rosso Rubino Micalizzato over beige leather upholstery, the car is equipped with a limited-slip differential, 20″ Challenge alloy wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes, bi-xenon headlights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, rear parking sensors, carbon-fiber Daytona-style seats, a Sony head unit, a Bose sound system, a K40 Calibre front and rear radar and laser detector system, rear luggage straps, and dual-zone automatic climate control. The current owner acquired the car in 2022 and has since added approximately 1k of the 33k miles. This 599 GTB Fiorano is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner in Wisconsin with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, service records, spare parts, a factory Ferrari car cover, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Nevada title in the name of the owner’s trust. The 599 was designed by Pininfarina under the direction of Jason Castriota and featured Ferrari’s first all-aluminum GT car chassis. This example is finished in Rosso Rubino Micalizzato and has bi-xenon headlights, side air vents, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, rear parking sensors, flying-buttress C-pillars, and quad exhaust outlets. The seller states the front bumper cover was refinished before replacement paint protection film was applied to the area in December 2024, and paint protection film is also affixed to the rest of the body. Paint chips and exterior imperfections are highlighted in the gallery. The 20″ Challenge alloy wheels wear Pirelli P Zero tires that were mounted in October 2024. The suspension features magnetorheological dampers, and stopping power is provided by yellow Ferrari-branded multi-piston brake calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated ceramic-composite rotors at each corner. A brake fluid flush was performed and a power steering leak was repaired in October 2024. The cabin features power-adjustable Daytona-style seats with carbon-fiber backs trimmed in beige leather with contrasting piping, while carbon-fiber trim accents the interior. A K40 Calibre front and rear radar and laser detector system is installed, and additional appointments include a power-adjustable steering column, a Sony head unit, rear luggage straps, drilled metal pedals, a Bose sound system, and dual-zone automatic climate control. The passenger defroster vent is cracked, and the sticky buttons were refinished in 2017. The removed head unit/CD player is included in the sale and shown in the gallery. The carbon-fiber-accented steering wheel features an engine start button and a manettino to control driving settings. Instrumentation includes a 10k-rpm tachometer, a 220-mph speedometer, and a digital display screen. The digital odometer indicates 33k miles, approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership. A TPMS warning light is said to remain illuminated. The 6.0-liter F140 V12 was factory rated at 611 horsepower and 448 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed and the valve cover gaskets were replaced in October 2024. Power is routed to the rear wheels through an F1 SuperFast electro-hydraulic six-speed automatic gearbox, which can be operated via paddle shifters. Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Ferrari of Houston in Texas, along with factory colors, equipment, options, and a total suggested retail price of $330,341.
