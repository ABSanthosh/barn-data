  "description": "The Hyundai Exter sub-compact SUV and the Verna mid-size sedan are set to get mid-cycle facelifts by next year. Both models had launched in India in 2023, and the arrival of refreshed models just 3 years after indicates Hyundai India is accelerating its product lifecycles. Hyundai Verna facelift expected to get new front end Likely to retain 1.5-litre petrol and turbo-petrol engines Hyundai Exter facelift also likely to retain 1.2-litre petrol and CNG options Hyundai Verna facelift details Changes are expected to be cosmetic only IMAGE SOURCE: Rushlane Recent spy shots that surfaced online show that the refreshed Verna is likely to look quite similar to the current model from the rear and the sides. The facelift for the fourth-gen model wears heavily camouflage, but the details that can be gleaned include tail-lights that seem to be very similar, the same 16-inch alloy wheels, and a slightly tweaked rear bumper. We expect most of the design changes to feature on the front-end as the current Verna has an aggressive-looking nose that polarises opinion. The interior is not expected to change much, though the features list and amount of safety kit is likely to expand. The current Verna’s 115hp, 1.5-litre naturally aspirated petrol and the 160hp, 1.5-litre turbo-petrol engine options are also expected to continue unchanged. While the NA engine has a CVT auto option and the turbocharged unit has a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox option, both get a 6-speed manual as standard. With the facelift, the Honda City, Volkswagen Virtus and Skoda Slavia rival’s price will increase from the current Rs 11.07 lakh-17.58 lakh. Hyundai Exter facelift details Current Exter used for representation only. Hyundai’s answer to the Tata Punch and entry-level versions of the Nissan Magnite and Renault Kiger is also likely to get cosmetic changes only with the facelift. There’s little information about the refreshed Exter available, but more features, new upholstery and additional safety kit could be made available. The current model’s 1.2-litre engine – which makes 83hp on petrol and 69hp on CNG – is expected to continue, along with the manual and AMT options for the petrol mill. The Exter facelift will command a premium over the current car's Rs 6.00 lakh-10.51 lakh price range. All prices, ex-showroom, India Also see:  Hyundai overtakes Tata in May 2025 sales, takes third spot New Hyundai Verna SX+ trim launched at Rs 13.79 lakh Hyundai Exter gets more affordable sunroof-equipped variants",
