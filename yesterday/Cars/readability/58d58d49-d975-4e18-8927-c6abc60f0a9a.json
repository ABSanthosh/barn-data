  "description": "Mitsubishi has teased an all-new seven-seater SUV, set to be revealed later this month. The public will get its first look at the Philippine Motor Show, which starts in the coming weeks. While the Japanese brand is no longer present in India, it has a decent line-up overseas, especially in the ASEAN markets. New Mitsubishi three-row SUV will be based on the XForce Expected to come with a 1.5-litre, four-cyl petrol engine Will get multiple drive modes; no 4WD Mitsubishi SUV concept: what does the teaser show? The teaser previews the SUV's overall shape, suggesting it looks like an extended version of the XForce, currently sold in markets such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, and a few other ASEAN nations. The XForce SUV is Mitsubishi’s answer to the Creta in these markets, and this extended version will be the Japanese brand’s Alcazar rival. This new SUV, as seen in the teaser, will have a lot in common with the XForce but will feature some unique styling bits and, of course, an extended wheelbase as key differentiators. On the inside, the new seven-seater SUV will retain the XForce’s dashboard and feature list with a few add-ons. The XForce comes with a 12.3-inch touch infotainment screen, an 8-inch digital instrument cluster, and an 8-speaker sound system developed by Yamaha as a part of its collaboration with Mitsubishi. The centre console houses multiple USB ports, smartphone holders, and a wireless charger. Also, its rear seats can be reclined. Under the hood, we expect the new SUV to come with the same 1.5-litre naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine as the XForce, producing 105hp and 141Nm of torque. It comes with a CVT automatic gearbox as standard and also gets four drive modes: Normal, Wet, Gravel, and Mud. Will the Mitsubishi SUV come to India? Despite being a part of the Renault-Nissan global alliance, there is no official confirmation on Mitsubishi’s India comeback. The brand is currently focused on emerging markets such as Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand. Mitsubishi's sister brands, Renault and Nissan, continue to thrive in the Indian market with models like the Renault Kiger, Triber, and Nissan Magnite. Next year, we will see the all-new Duster and its Nissan counterpart, followed by their seven-seater variants.
