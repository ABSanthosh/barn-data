  "text": "2025 Chrysler Pacifica Plug-In Hybrid ($7500)REVIEW, PRICE, SPECSChryslerThe Chrysler Pacifica Plug-In Hybrid is only offered with front-wheel drive. Its PHEV powertrain musters 260 horsepower from a gas-fed 3.6-liter V-6 and two electric motors, which are fed by a 16.0-kWh lithium-ion battery pack that allows the van to travel 33 miles on electrons alone. In typical minivan fashion, the Pacifica is full of practicality. The interior has seating for seven, it's packed with cupholders and slide-out bins, and while the battery gets in the way of the folding rear seats, Chrysler added extra padding as a consolation. Pricing for the hybrid model starts at $52,750, and it's the only PHEV on the list that's eligible for the full $7500 tax credit. Jack Fitzgerald’s love for cars stems from his as yet unshakable addiction to Formula 1. After a brief stint as a detailer for a local dealership group in college, he knew he needed a more permanent way to drive all the new cars he couldn’t afford and decided to pursue a career in auto writing. By hounding his college professors at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, he was able to travel Wisconsin seeking out stories in the auto world before landing his dream job at Car and Driver. His new goal is to delay the inevitable demise of his 2010 Volkswagen Golf.",
