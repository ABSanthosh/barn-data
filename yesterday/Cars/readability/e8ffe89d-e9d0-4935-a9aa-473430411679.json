Powered by a 4.5-liter DOHC V8 linked with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle, the car is further equipped with an electronic differential, 20″ five-spoke alloy wheels, Novitec lowering springs, adaptive xenon headlights, parking sensors, carbon-ceramic brakes, carbon-fiber interior trim, and dual-zone automatic climate control. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2025, this 458 Italia has under 30k miles and is now offered at no reserve with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, service records, a battery tender, a car cover, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title. The car is finished in Grigio Scuro and has adaptive xenon headlights, fog lights, front and rear parking sensors, a heat-insulating windscreen, LED taillights, and triple exhaust outlets. The 20″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Toyo tires. The car is equipped with Novitec lowering springs, and braking is handled by silver-finished Ferrari calipers over cross-drilled carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners. The left-rear hub carrier and rear brake pads were replaced in February 2025, at which time a brake fluid flush was also performed. The carbon-fiber racing seats are upholstered in Charcoal leather with Alcantara inserts, Cavallino Rampante logos on the headrests, and contrasting stitching, while carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin. Features include a CD stereo, Alcantara floor mats, Homelink, drilled aluminum pedals, and dual-zone automatic climate control. A replacement cabin air filter was installed in February 2025. The carbon-fiber- and leather-trimmed steering wheel fronts column-mounted carbon-fiber shift paddles and features LED shift indicator lights as well as a red engine-start button and an adjustable manettino that toggles among several traction control and vehicle settings. Instrumentation consists of a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline flanked by two configurable displays. The digital odometer indicates under 30k miles. The mid-mounted 4.5-liter F136F V8 features a flat-plane crankshaft as well as dry-sump lubrication, and was factory rated at 562 horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque. Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a Getrag seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronic differential. Replacement spark plugs were fitted in January 2025, an oil change was performed, the transaxle fluid was replaced, and the coolant was flushed in February 2025, the battery was replaced in May 2025, and the car passed an emissions inspection in June 2025. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Ferrari of Palm Beach in West Palm Beach, Florida, along with factory equipment, options, and a total suggested retail price of $292,491. A binder of service documentation accompanies the car, and photos of individual records are provided in the gallery below. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
