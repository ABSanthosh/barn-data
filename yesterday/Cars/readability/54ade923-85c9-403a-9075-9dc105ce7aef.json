  "description": "Mitsubishi has taken the wraps of the DST seven-seat SUV concept at the ongoing Philippine International Motor Show (PIMS 2024). Teaser images that were released a few weeks ago had confirmed that the SUV will preview of a larger derivative of the popular Mitsubishi Xforce SUV. The production-spec DST SUV will see a debut sometime next year. Mitsubishi DST concept previews three-row version of the Xforce SUV Will come with a 1.5-litre four cylinder petrol No 4WD tech expected Mitsubishi DST concept: what exactly is it? The DST concept from Mitsubishi will spawn a three-row SUV primarily for markets where the Xforce is currently sold. The Xforce is a popular SUV in Indonesia and a few other ASEAN nations and its three-row derivative will give the customers another option in the segment. The Xforce SUV is Mitsubishi’s answer to the Creta in these markets, and this extended version will be the Japanese brand’s equivalent of the Alcazar; do note that the Alcazar is not on sale in ASEAN markets, where the Carens-like Hyundai Stargazer MPV is sold instead. The first images of the concept released by Mitsubishi confirm that there will be a lot in common with the Xforce. The concept seems to have a longer wheelbase and bodyshell to accommodate the additional row of seats. The overall styling is quite similar to the Xforce when viewed from every side. It gets large alloy wheels and a decent amount of body cladding, which adds to its SUV character. The interior has multiple shades and soft touch materials. The steering wheel is all-new two-spoke unit and some of the controls and gauges are, naturally, a bit too concept-ish. These will be replaced by more conventional units once the SUV goes into production. The DST seems to share the 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen and 8-inch digital instrument cluster with the Xforce. While no powertrain details are given, we expect the production version of the DST concept to come with the same 1.5-litre petrol engine as the Xforce. A CVT automatic gearbox will be offered as standard, along with four drive modes: Normal, Wet, Gravel, and Mud. Will the Mitsubishi DST come to India? There is no word on Mitsubishi’s India re-entry at the moment despite the brand now being a part of the Renault-Nissan alliance. The Japanese company is currently focused on emerging markets such as Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand. Mitsubishi's sister brands, Renault and Nissan, are working on bringing the all-new Duster SUV, its Nissan counterpart, and seven-seater variants of the same starting next year.  Also see: Mitsubishi Pajero Sport gets another facelift abroad 13 new special edition cars, SUVs launched this festive season Mahindra XUV700 waiting period increases to 2 months",
