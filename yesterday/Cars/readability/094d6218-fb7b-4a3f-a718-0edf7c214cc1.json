  "text": "Jul 18, 2025 7:30 PM EDTWhat sets Subaru’s new Uncharted EV apart  Subaru has revealed its new Uncharted electric vehicle (EV) in person for the first time, and the compact SUV is bound to put some pressure on the electric variants of the Hyundai Kona and Kia Niro. The all-new Uncharted Sport and GT trims offer up to 338 horsepower, translating to a 0-60 mph time of less than 5 seconds, and an estimated 290-mile range. This horsepower stems from dual electric motors on the front and rear axles, and standard all-wheel drive (AWD) on two of the three variants. The Uncharted’s complete trim lineup includes Premium FWD, Sport, and GT levels. Drivers receive over 300 miles of range on the front-wheel drive (FWD) trim, but lower horsepower at 221. Fast-charging each grade’s 74.7-kWh, high-capacity lithium-ion battery from 0% to 80% takes about thirty minutes, and selectable drive modes include Snow, Mud, and Dirt. Off-roading is enhanced by the model’s lightweight and rigid high-strength steel, structural support from its underfloor batteries, aerodynamic enhancements, and specifically tuned suspension components.  While this compact model is almost seven inches shorter than Subaru’s new Solterra electric SUV, it features 1.2 cubic feet of additional storage behind the second row for a total of 25 cubic feet. There’s seating for up to five passengers, and design touches, such as orange accents and soft-touch materials, characterize the cabin. Subaru StarTex interior upholstery is available on the Uncharted GT and Sport, and the GT trim also receives standard heated outboard rear seats. On the technology front, drivers receive a 14-inch touchscreen, dual wireless smartphone chargers, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Dual USB-C chargers are present in the rear, and a battery preconditioning system helps achieve the 30-minute charge time from 0% to 80%, even under challenging conditions such as cold weather. The digital gauge cluster is positioned above the dashboard, which contains a sleek LED ambient lighting strip. A panoramic glass roof paired with two-tone coloring helps form the Uncharted’s contemporary appearance, and trims like the GT feature ventilated front seats and 20-inch wheels. The other wheel option measures 18 inches, and AWD models contain low-profile roof rails. How does the Subaru Uncharted hold up versus the Hyundai Kona Electric and Kia Niro EV? The Subaru Uncharted beats both the Hyundai Kona Electric and Kia Niro EV in both power and range. The 2026 Hyundai Kona Electric boasts between 133 and 215 horsepower, while the Kia Niro EV offers 201 horsepower. The Kona Electric can take drivers between 200 and 260 miles on a single charge, versus the Niro EV’s 253-mile range. The Uncharted is also more off-road focused than its Hyundai and Kia counterparts, and features more cargo space behind its second row than the Niro, while falling short of the Kona Electric by just 0.5 cubic feet. Final thoughts The 2026 Subaru Uncharted will give the Hyundai Kona Electric and Kia Niro EV a run for their money with its sharp exterior styling, impressive range, off-road capability, and interior that doesn’t cut corners on tech. During the global in-person reveal of the Uncharted in New York, I noticed several standout elements that distinguished this Subaru from its competition, including rear door handles on the C-pillar, a striking headlight signature, and an interior that felt clean and straightforward, yet not dull. The 2026 Subaru Uncharted is expected to go on sale in early 2026, with pricing to be announced closer to its release. About the AuthorCody Carlson",
