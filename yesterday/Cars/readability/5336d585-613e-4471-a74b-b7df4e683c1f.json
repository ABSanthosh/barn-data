  "description": "Maruti Suzuki’s next big launch for India is the all-new Dzire compact sedan, the prices for which will be announced on November 11. In an earlier story, we had confirmed that Dzire will go on sale in India after Diwali 2024.  New Dzire will be sufficienctly marked out from Swift  Will have more features than outgoing model, including a sunroof  Petrol and petrol-CNG powertrains expected. New Maruti Dzire to look different from Swift With the new Dzire, Maruti will be aiming to take the premium route, especially in terms of design. It will help give a unique identity to the compact sedan, which will look a lot different than the Swift hatchback. However, both models will have a lot in common under the skin. Leaked images that surfaced earlier gave us some hint about the new Dzire’s design. It will feature an Audi-esque nose, a blacked-out horizontally slatted grille with some chrome elements, slim headlights with black bezels and a sportier-looking front bumper. The diamond-cut alloy wheels will be different from the Swift; the all-new wraparound LED tail-lights will get stylish LED outlines and some body parts with more angular creases will further help it differentiate from its hatchback sibling. New Maruti Dzire: expected features  In terms of feature, the new Dzire will get a sunroof and a few other creature comforts over the Swift. Though it will share a lot of its interior with the hatch, it will get lighter shades for the dashboard and upholstery for a premium feel. Features that will be carried over include a 9-inch free-standing touchscreen, automatic climate control and an analogue instrument cluster with a 4.2-inch digital MID. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the new Dzire could get ADAS – at least in the higher variants. New Maruti Dzire: powertrain options  The new Dzire will use the Swift’s 1.2-litre, three-cylinder Z Series petrol engine. It will come with a petrol-CNG option as well. While the petrol variants will get an automatic gearbox option, the CNG-powered ones will come with a five-speed manual only, as per our sources. Expect Maruti to commence bookings for the new Dzire in the coming weeks, with deliveries starting by around mid-November. Just like the current model, the new Dzire will take on the likes of the Hyundai Aura, Honda Amaze and Tata Tigor. The new Amaze is also due for a global debut in the coming months.
