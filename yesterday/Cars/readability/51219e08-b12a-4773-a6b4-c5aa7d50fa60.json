  "text": "Rudy Wijanarko/Shutterstock Walk into any parts store and you'll see the rows of glossy bottles promising to stop engine wear, boost fuel economy, and make your old clunker run like it just rolled out of the factory. The auto parts aisle is usually teeming with names like Lucas, Seafoam, Marvel Mystery Oil, and STP screaming from the shelves like they're the last line of defense between your car and the scrapyard. You've probably asked yourself the same thing most drivers do. Do these engine oil additives actually do anything? Or are they just overpriced snake oil (pun intended) with a slick label? The answer, as always –– it depends. Some additives can help in certain situations, but for most modern cars running synthetic oil that are designed to last up to 15,000 miles, they're about as useful as screen doors on a submarine. Welcome to the perplexing world of oil additives, where every product claims to extend engine life, boost performance, and clean internal parts like a mechanic in a bottle. Some of them do help, depending on the situation, but a lot of the time, especially in modern engines, they're solving problems that don't really exist. Not all engines need extra help Jacktamrong/Shutterstock Modern motor oils aren't just refined goop, they're carefully engineered cocktails packed with detergents, anti-foaming agents, anti-wear agents, and corrosion inhibitors. Every bottle is already loaded with chemistry meant to protect your engine. Start throwing in extra ingredients, and you might mess with that balance. Lucas Oil Stabilizer claims to reduce friction, improve oil lubricity, and reduce heat and frictional losses. Despite independent tests suggesting otherwise, it's not total BS. High-mileage oils can improve protection and offer better sealing capabilities to O-rings, gaskets and seals. But in modern cars with tight tolerances, thinner or lighter weight oils are more effective. Seafoam, on the other hand, is more of a cleaner. People dump it in the crankcase to break up sludge, or into the intake to de-gunk valves and chambers. If you've inherited a neglected engine or you're trying to revive a barn find, it might help. But it's not a miracle. In fact, a chemical cleaner like Seafoam can dissolve sludge and carbon deposits that can eventually find their way into oil passages and clog them, possibly causing engine damage. Other brands like Marvel Mystery Oil and STP promise similar benefits. Here's the catch, though. If you're using a high-quality oil and changing it on schedule, you're probably not gaining much by adding extra ingredients to the mix. Where additives might make sense So who should use them? If your car clocks a lot of miles, or is starting to use more oil than normal, some engine oil additives might give you a little extra life between oil changes and surface cleaning benefits, although this shouldn't be an excuse to deviate from manufacturer-recommended oil change intervals. But many of these miracle mixes are unproven, untested with your oil blend, and simply cannot convert an inferior lubricant to a premium product. They can overload your oil's chemistry, and even deteriorate performance. Some even trick lab tests. For daily drivers that see regular maintenance and get quality oil during scheduled services? Skip it. Modern engine oil already comes packed with detergents, anti-corrosion agents, anti-wear agents, and stabilizers. Additives are tools, not fixes. Used right, in the right engine, they can help. Used wrong, they're a waste of money or worse. If your engine is healthy and your oil is fresh, save the $15 for something useful. Like gas. Or tacos.",
