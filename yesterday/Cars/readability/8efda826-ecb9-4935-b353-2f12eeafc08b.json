That’s why it’s always interesting to us when a company like Nokian, better known for its winter and all-season tires, rolls out something new in the ultra-high performance (UHP) category.Called the Surpass AS01, this tire brings the brand attention to a rubber subsegment in which the competition is fierce and customer expectations are high. After all, if someone is splashing out on an UHP tire, they’re likely chasing tenths at the track or looking for enjoyable performance on their favorite back road. Nokian hasn’t been in this space since the departure of its zLine AS tire. But the shuttering of that line, and sale of the Russian facility which made them, permitted the brand to focus on developing something new for the UHP arena, meaning the new Surpass AS01 isn’t just a rehash of old technology. In fact, its compound features a higher proportion of silica than any other tire Nokian has introduced in the all-season space. This should improve handling and longevity compared to the departed offering.As for the tread design, it isn’t a carbon copy from shoulder to shoulder, with an outer-middle rib intended to deliver high-performance cornering while the solid center rib packs 3Dsiping for conditions like foul weather. Circumferential grooves and so-called shoulder claws are said to help in that regard, as well. Speaking of shoulders, they are of a closed design which does help wear properties but also help dampen road noise, at least in this author’s experience. We’ll see if it does the same for these hoops. Given the current climate, Nokian knew it would be helpful to brand the Surpass with its Electric Fit stamp of approval. This isn’t an industry standard like a three-peak mountain snowflake for winter tires but does indicate the maker kept one eye on measures like rolling resistance so the tire won’t completely scupper EV driving range.The tire started shipping in early January to tire shops across North America in popular sizes, 65 of ‘em, ranging from 16 to 21 inches.[Image: Nokian Tyres]Become a TTAC insider.
