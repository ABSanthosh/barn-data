  "description": "Even as KTM AG is navigating its way out of a tough financial crisis, the Indian arm of the company (owned and managed wholly by Bajaj) remains unaffected. In fact, KTM India is seeing strong demand for two recently updated models: the 200 Duke and 250 Duke. 200 Duke and 250 Duke are seeing good traction KTM India remains unaffected by global debt There are 440 KTM dealers across India Our sister publication, Autocar Professional, had the opportunity to talk to Rakesh Sharma, ED of Bajaj Auto, about KTM’s operations in India amid the parent company’s financial woes.  “There has been no impact on our domestic business. KTM products sold in India are manufactured locally in Chakan and distributed through our network of 440 dealers. In fact, KTM has had an exceptional quarter, its best ever, with the refreshed Duke 200 and Duke 250 – launched in October – performing exceptionally well. Both models continue to see strong demand,\" said Sharma. “We have felt an impact on exports. Previously, we manufactured lower CC products for KTM, which KTM distributed to their international markets. This export volume has significantly decreased. Last year, it was about 6,500 units per month. In Q3, it dropped to around 3,500 monthly units, constituting approximately 6 percent of our exports last year. In Q3 of this year, it fell to 3 percent. Exports are on hold and will only resume once the situation becomes clearer after February 25th.” To read the full interview, you can tap HERE.
