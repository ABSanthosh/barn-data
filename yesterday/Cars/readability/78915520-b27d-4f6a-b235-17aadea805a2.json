  "description": "The BMW R 12 G/S has been revealed overseas after the brand teased its imminent arrival a few days ago. This is the scrambler version based on the R 12 nineT platform and it shares its engine and main frame with that bike.  BMW R 12 GS has 200mm / 210mm (F/R) of suspension travel It shares its engine, main frame with the R 12 nineT Available with 17-inch or 18-inch rear wheel options BMW R 12 GS engine, weight, styling details R 12 GS rides on a 21/17-inch (F/R) setup with raised suspension The R 12 G/S is a scrambler that is based on the R 12 nineT. In terms of design changes, the R 12 G/S features hand protectors with cockpit fairing as standard.  The R 12 G/S comes with a 21-inch front wheel as standard. For the rear wheel, there are two options, depending on the chosen package: Standard or Enduro Package Pro. The main differences between these two packages are the rear wheel size and seat height. The Enduro Package Pro upgrades the rear wheel from 17-inches to 18-inches and raises the seat height from 860mm to 875mm. With the optional Rallye seat, the seat height can be increased further to 890mm. Additionally, the Enduro Package Pro includes features like off-road footpegs, a 20mm handlebar riser and the Enduro Pro riding mode, which adds to the standard Rain, Road, and Enduro modes. It sports minimal bodywork and sits higher from the ground with a fully adjustable USD fork with 200mm of travel and a monoshock with 210mm of travel. The R 12 G/S has a tank capacity of 15.5 litres and with it fully brimmed, it tips the scales at 229kg. These updates give the scrambler a distinctly purposeful stance, complemented by the Paralever swingarm. Its design is more closely aligned with the earlier HP2 Enduro than the R 1300 GS, and its heritage can be traced back to the iconic R 80 G/S. Braking duties are handled by twin 310mm discs up front with axially mounted Brembo callipers coupled with a 265mm rotor at the rear. It gets a full suite of electronic rider aids from BMW such as traction control, cornering ABS (switchable), engine braking control, keyless ignition and LED headlight with optional adaptive headlight. The 1,170cc, air/oil-cooled, horizontally-opposed (boxer) twin-cylinder engine is carried over from the R 12 nineT that produces 109hp at 7,000rpm and 115Nm at 6,500rpm. It provides the same peak power at identical rpm as the R 12 nineT. It is available in a single variant with three colour options. It remains to be seen when BMW launches the R 12 G/S in India and at what price. Also see: Royal Enfield Classic 650 launched at Rs 3.37 lakh",
