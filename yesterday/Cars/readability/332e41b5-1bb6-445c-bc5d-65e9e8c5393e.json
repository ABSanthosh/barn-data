  "description": "This 1987 Porsche 911 Turbo coupe is a US-market example that was optioned with slantnose bodywork as part of Porsche’s Sonderwunsch (Special Wishes) program and was reportedly the first M505-equipped example delivered in the US. Used as a press car, it was displayed at multiple events in 1987 including the Indianapolis Toys for Grown Ups Expo, the 5th Annual Atlanta International Auto Show, and the Greater New York International Auto Show before being featured on the cover of the June 1987 issue of Automobile Magazine. It was purchased from Langeland Porsche of Indianapolis in August 1987, and it spent time in Connecticut, Florida, and California before being exported to Belgium in 2015 and to Malta in 2021. Finished in Diamond Blue Metallic over burgundy leather upholstery, the car is powered by a turbocharged 3.3-liter flat-six mated to a four-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential. Equipment consists of a sunroof, a tea tray rear spoiler, power-adjustable front seats, air conditioning, and Alpine audio equipment. This 911 Turbo flachbau has 55k miles and is now offered with the owner’s manual, warranty booklet, and window sticker as well as service records, a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, correspondence from Porsche Cars North America, a copy of Automobile Magazine, service records, and Malta registration.",

This 911 Turbo flachbau has 55k miles and is now offered with the owner’s manual, warranty booklet, and window sticker as well as service records, a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, correspondence from Porsche Cars North America, a copy of Automobile Magazine, service records, and Malta registration. The car is finished in Diamond Blue Metallic (L697) and is equipped with factory flachbau bodywork fitted by Porsche’s Sonderwunsch department, which includes pop-up headlights, vented front fenders, side strakes, and extended side sills. Additional equipment includes a sunroof, headlight washers, fog lights, a tea tray rear spoiler, and a rear window wiper. Touch-up paint has been applied near the fuel filler, and photos of stone chips and paint-meter readings are displayed in the gallery below. The 16″ Fuchs wheels feature body-color centers and are mounted with Continental ContiSportContact tires measuring 205/55 up front and 245/45 out back. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes with black Porsche-branded calipers over drilled rotors at all four corners. The power-adjustable front seats are trimmed in burgundy leather upholstery that extends to the dashboard and door panels. Color-coordinated carpeting lines the footwells, and additional interior elements include an alarm, Turbo-branded floor mats, air conditioning, power windows, and an Alpine CD stereo. A Special Wishes Alpine CD changer and control unit were also specified at a cost of approximately $10,000, according to the window sticker. The four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel is mounted via an optional raised hub and frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer flanked by a 170-mph speedometer and readouts for oil pressure, oil temperature, oil level, fuel level, and boost pressure. The Special Wishes center console houses an analog clock and gauges for temperature and voltage. The six-digit mechanical odometer indicates 55k miles, approximately 2k miles of which were added under current ownership. The turbocharged 3.3-liter flat-six was factory rated at 282 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque. The battery was replaced in 2023 and an oil change was performed in June 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. A video detailing the condition of the underside is included below. The Porsche Production Specifications Certificate shows a production date of December 1986, along with factory colors and options. Also accompanying the vehicle will be the owner’s manual, warranty booklet, and window sticker in addition to correspondence from Porsche Cars North America, a copy of Automobile Magazine, and service records.
