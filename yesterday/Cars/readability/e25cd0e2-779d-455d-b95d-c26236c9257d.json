  "description": "Kia India is all set to reveal the Syros, its all-new compact SUV on December 19. Ahead of its global debut, we can confirm that the Syros will go on sale in January with not one but two engine options.  Syros will come with a 1.0-liter turbo petrol engine 1.5-liter diesel will also be sold alongside Deliveries likely to start by late January 2025 Syros to be fifth Kia model with a diesel engine While most carmakers are shying away from introducing new diesel-powered models, Kia India seems to be bucking the trend by launching its fifth product in India with the diesel engine. The Syros will come with the tried and tested 1.5-litre diesel engine that powers many Kia and Hyundai models in the country. This engine delivers 115hp and 250Nm of torque and sees duty in the Sonet, Venue, Seltos, Carens, Creta and the Alcazar in our market. As for gearbox options, the Syros diesel will come with a six-speed manual and a six-speed torque convertor automatic just like the one seen on the Sonet.  Syros will also come with a 1.0 turbo petrol The Syros will also come with a 1.0-liter turbo petrol unit good for 120 hp and 172Nm. It will come with a manual as well as a 7-speed DCT automatic gearbox. However, the Syros will not get the naturally aspirated 1.2-litre petrol engine that's available on the Sonet. This may result in a relatively high starting price, but that's also in keeping with the Syros' more premium positioning over the Sonet.  Syros launch and delivery timeline The Kia Syros will see a global debut on December 19. Sources tell us that a price announcement could take place in January, likely at the Bharat Mobility Show where the SUV will be shown for the first time to the general public. Expect Kia to start delivering the Syros to customers by late January or early February next year.
