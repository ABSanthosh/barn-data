  "text": "From Magma to engaging electric cars and more, Genesis has a plan to be unique 3 hours ago by Stephen Rivers Genesis intends on making its Magma performance brand really special.Product planning head Ash Corson referenced Bugatti and GMA in his interview with Carscoops.He also confirmed that the G70 sports sedan is integral to the brand. Genesis is in the midst of a critical phase. The Korean luxury arm of Hyundai is gaining market share while focusing on improving the customer experience and introducing new models. After the launch of the updated GV70, we caught up with Ash Corson, Director of Genesis Product Planning. Corson has an extensive background, having helped grow and launch 11 product lines in previous roles. He played a key role in launching Lexus’s F Sport brand and later joined Hyundai, where he worked on mobility and connectivity. Late last year, he took over product planning for Genesis. At the LA Auto Show, we had a chance to sit down and pick his brain about the future of the brand.  Unique Approach To Electric Performance First, we asked Corson how Genesis would differentiate itself regarding electric performance. For example, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N is widely considered one of the very best electric performance cars in the marker right now. It rightfully gained that notoriety with a mix of blistering performance and fun engaging features. How does Genesis expand on that theme without copying it too much? More: Genesis Confirms GV60 Magma Launch For Next Fall “The I5N is one of the groups best products. There’s a reason that it continues to rack up awards including the engagement, the fun-to-drive aspect. I think that’s really where it excels. When we talk about Genesis and Magma, it’s a different beast. The origins of Magma go back to Korea where it’s literally volcanic”, he explained. “There’s this underlying immense power beneath the surface. It’s really again performance art. I think is a great way, in my opinion, to think of the directional positioning of what that will look like. How it sounds, how it feels the type, you know, the tactile nature of some of the controls but the precision too,” Corson continued. “You look at Gordon Murray with his T50 and that precision there or Bugatti with their watch faces. There are lots of great things going on in the industry but the common route I think is engagement. I think the Genesis Magma will really again evoke the emotion at the product level in a deeper way than what’s out there right now.” Authenticity In The Genesis Magma Lineup Considering that Magma is evidently going to be a trim that could end up on many models, we wondered how Genesis would keep it from getting too watered down. Notably, Corson spent a long time at Lexus helping to develop the F performance brand. Today, one could say that Lexus uses F-Sport a little too liberally. Genesis wants to stand out by making its Magma lineup authentic. “Our announcement that we’re going racing at Le Mans is a sign of authenticity. You really have to make sure you’re authentic and have credibility in terms of what you are presenting to the customer. The GV60 Magma has that credibility. It crushed the Goodwood Hill Climb, and it will be an award-winning product too. Our intent is not to just milk this for merchandising. If we deliver the sensations we often talk about… touch, sight, sound, scent, then by nature we can’t dilute it.” G70 Future: A Key To Genesis’ Legacy Finally, we asked about the G70. It’s the way that many younger buyers find the Genesis brand. That said, it’s an obvious candidate for the Magma treatment. Corson already disclosed that Genesis sees Magma as a trim that could extend to all models but we wanted more confirmation about the future of G70. While he didn’t say exactly what that looks like, it’s clear that Genesis isn’t forgetting about its sports sedan. “It’s our Gateway product. It’s our youngest product and in my opinion quite strategically important to get those enthusiasts’ advocates. So, it’s something at the platform level that my team discusses, you know, globally every day including this week,” said Corson. Review: 2024 Genesis G70 Turbo V6 Is Better Than Ever “So it’s something that our market is the biggest for. There are other markets that aren’t really selling the G70 in their lineups. That being said, you know, it’s an obvious space for Magma, for example. So I can’t comment on the, you know, detail on that product space because it’s an active one but it’s something that we think about very, uh, intently.” Looking Ahead For Genesis’ Sports Sedan Hopefully, that will lead to another generation in the not-too-distant future. Every major luxury brand Genesis is targeting has a high-quality gas-powered sports sedan. Keeping the G70 is just one more way the automaker can demonstrate that authenticity. We’ll continue to be on the lookout for developments in line with these new statements.  GENESIS CONCEPTS",

It’s the way that many younger buyers find the Genesis brand. That said, it’s an obvious candidate for the Magma treatment. Corson already disclosed that Genesis sees Magma as a trim that could extend to all models but we wanted more confirmation about the future of G70. While he didn’t say exactly what that looks like, it’s clear that Genesis isn’t forgetting about its sports sedan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s our Gateway product. It’s our youngest product and in my opinion quite strategically important to get those enthusiasts’ advocates. So, it’s something at the platform level that my team discusses, you know, globally every day including this week,” said Corson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReview: \u003ca href=\"https://www.carscoops.com/2024/07/review-2024-genesis-g70-3-3-is-better-than-ever/\"\u003e2024 Genesis G70 Turbo V6 Is Better Than Ever\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n     \t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“So it’s something that our market is the biggest for. There are other markets that aren’t really selling the G70 in their lineups. That being said, you know, it’s an obvious space for Magma, for example. So I can’t comment on the, you know, detail on that product space because it’s an active one but it’s something that we think about very, uh, intently.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eLooking Ahead For Genesis’ Sports Sedan\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully, that will lead to another generation in the not-too-distant future. Every major luxury brand Genesis is targeting has a high-quality gas-powered sports sedan. Keeping the G70 is just one more way the automaker can demonstrate that authenticity. We’ll continue to be on the lookout for developments in line with these new statements. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n                    \u003ch5\u003eGENESIS CONCEPTS\u003c/h5\u003e        \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/themes/carscoops/assets/images/icons/arrow.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/themes/carscoops/assets/images/icons/arrow.png\" data-type=\"inarticle-image\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/themes/carscoops/assets/images/icons/arrow.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/themes/carscoops/assets/images/icons/arrow.png\" data-type=\"inarticle-image\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n                     \n\n                        \n                    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
