This 575M Maranello is now offered with a window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, service records, a car cover, a tool kit, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Connecticut title in the seller’s name. The Pininfarina-designed aluminum bodywork is finished in Corsa Red and features a hood scoop, a front spoiler, and front fender vents. Scuderia Ferrari fender shields were optioned from the factory, and further details include xenon headlights, halogen fog lights, and quad exhaust tips exiting through the rear bumper cover. Paint correction was performed in November 2024. The seller mentions that the nose and part of the hood are covered with paint-protection film. The 19×8.5″ front and 19×10.5″ rear BBS modular wheels are mounted with 255/35 front and 305/30 rear Bridgestone Potenza Sport tires with 2022 date codes. The 575M featured a Skyhook suspension system with adaptive dampers. Stopping power is provided by optional red-finished Brembo calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors at all four corners. Work in 2024 included replacing the brake rotors and hardware, resurfacing the pads, and performing a brake fluid flush. The cabin underwent a refresh in 2024 which involved disassembling the interior, repairing a sagging headliner, and refinishing sticky buttons and switchgear. The power-adjustable Daytona-style seats are upholstered in black leather with red inserts, piping, and stitching. Matching leather extends to the dash, center console, and door panels as well as the rear storage shelf and luggage straps. A Ferrari-branded Becker stereo is connected to a Hi-Fi stereo system as well as a trunk-mounted CD changer, and additional amenities include automatic climate control, electric windows, and driver-seat memory settings. The three-spoke steering wheel is wrapped in leather and paired with a gated shifter. Instrumentation consists of a tachometer with a 7,600-rpm redline flanked by a 220-mph speedometer as well as gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 14k miles, approximately 6k of which have been added under current ownership. The 5.7-liter quad-cam F133E V12 features 48 valves, dry-sump lubrication, and Bosch Motronic engine management for a factory-rated output of 508 horsepower and 434 lb-ft of torque. A major service in 2024 included replacing the timing and accessory belts as well as the tensioners, camshaft cover seals, spark plugs, coolant hoses, and the battery. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Ferrari of Long Island in Glen Cove, New York, as well as factory colors, options, and a total suggested retail price of $235,611. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. Photo Gallery You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
