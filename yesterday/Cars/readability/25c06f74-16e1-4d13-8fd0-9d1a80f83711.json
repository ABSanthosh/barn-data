  "description": "Five years after the launch of the original 390 Adventure, there’s a brand new one in town, and this time around, KTM have got it right. The new 390 ADV makes up for its predecessor's adventure-related shortcomings, and it manages to do so thanks to the all-new platform that debuted in the Gen 3 Duke. Everything that benefited the Duke does so here as well, including the side-slung monoshock and repositioned airbox, which have helped bring the seat height down from 855mm on the previous ADV to a more palatable 830mm. KTM 390 Adventure changes for 2025 But it's not just a lower seat height that takes the new 390 ADV a big step forward, because this bike now has more suspension travel (up from 170/177mm to 200/205mm), and it also has much more ground clearance (200-237mm). In fact, the design of the new 399cc engine also contributes to the ground clearance, thanks to a higher positioning for the crankshaft compared with the old 373cc motor. So, in many ways, the new-gen 399cc platform shines brightest when it comes to the ADV and its Enduro/SMC siblings. With 46hp and 39Nm, the motor makes the same numbers as the 390 Duke, but it gets a bigger 46-teeth rear sprocket (up by three teeth), which compensates for the added weight and the larger wheels. What truly stands out is the engine’s duality. It’s punchy and exciting at high revs when you want it and results in this being the only bike in the segment that manages a sub-6 second 0-100kph time in our tests. But more importantly, it’s also calm and relaxed at lower speeds, which makes it easy to live with on a day-to-day basis. Curved radiator on the 390 Adventure. There are three riding modes – Rain, Street, and Off-Road – which adjust throttle response, ABS and traction control settings. Off-road mode is the most reactive of the three, but it's also usable enough even in the city. One common concern with single-cylinder engines is vibration and the KTM suffers from it as well. While the buzz is very well controlled in the handlebars, it gets quite pronounced in the footpegs, especially at city speeds. However, out on the highway, the vibrations don’t get overwhelming and this bike can hold 120kph or even higher with an ease and composure that its rivals don’t quite match.  The bi-directional shifter is not flawless and sometimes feels a bit clunky, but it adds to the fun factor of this motorcycle. The underbelly exhaust provides a typical KTM soundtrack: a brappy, exciting sound at high revs and a clattery, unremarkable note at gentle speeds – something to be expected from a high-strung single-cylinder engine. As for the exhaust design, an upswept unit would have certainly looked more appropriate but KTM says there are no concerns with water wading and have tested the bike in water crossings 400mm deep. KTM 390 Adventure ergonomics, seat comfort The 830mm seat height is still on the tall end for the average 5’6” rider, but the lower weight and weight balance on this bike make it easier than its immediate rival to manage. The rider ergonomics are also an improvement over the old bike with better placed footpegs. The position is especially improved when it comes to standing up off-road, with more real estate on the bike to grip with your lower body. A slightly taller bar would have been nice for off-road work, but the overall set up works as is. The opposite holds true for the tall, non-adjustable windscreen – it works well at highway speeds but blocks so much air that the rider will wish for more cooling breeze when riding inside the city in the summer heat. The 390 Adventure has ergos that are more conducive to off-road riding now. When it comes to handling, the 390 Adventure feels light and nimble, especially when compared to the Himalayan which weighs a full 14 kilos more. This is a tall bike, but it feels relatively agile and easier to manage in city conditions. A reasonably light clutch and well-controlled engine heat dissipation add to its usability in the city. The seat itself, while not immediately uncomfortable, is on the firm side, and I found myself feeling sore in about an hour’s time. A more plush accessory seat would be nice, but as of now KTM has only three accessories on offer – a more comprehensive front mudguard, a centre stand and a headlamp guard. KTM 390 Adventure off-road performance  The new 390 Adventure shines brightest when it ventures off the beaten path. With a combination of relatively low weight, a balanced feel, and impressive suspension travel, this bike is more than capable in a variety of off-road conditions. The 21-inch front wheel, combined with the confidence-inspiring chassis, allows the 390 to tackle rocky, loose terrains with ease. The ground clearance also encourages you to clamber over large rocks and mounds with the knowledge that the bike also has an aluminium bash plate. All this leads to a bike that encourages you to ride out into unknown terrain, and that’s a very nice thing for an adventure motorcycle. The new 390 ADV is very capable off-road. Things start to become an issue when you push the bike hard, especially over big jumps. At this point, the suspension blows through its stroke and bottoms out. Thankfully, the fork is adjustable for compression and rebound while the rear gets preload and rebound adjustability. I kept adding compression damping till all 30 clicks were in on the fork, at which point the KTM was a lot more compliant off-road, but more skilled riders who intend to push this bike hard off-road will probably want to look at aftermarket options for changing the suspension’s spring weights and/or the damping rates. But despite coming close to the limits of the stock suspension, it's clear that this chassis manages to offer a light and friendly feel, but it is also up for quite a high level of off-road riding. I believe it manages this balance better than any similar rival on sale in India at the moment. KTM 390 Adventure on-road handling On-road handling-wise, the same attributes that appealed off-road makes the difference. The light and agile nature extends to the way the motorcycle corners, and it's a similar story of ease meeting confidence. Direction changes don’t take much effort and the bike is happy to lean quite far over without the footpegs scraping. On the road, the bike feels light and agile, with quick direction changes. Suspension comfort and its ability to absorb rough roads is quite good, but not as good as the Himalayan 450. The Apollo Tramplr tyres are a good fit for the motorcycle in terms of their road grip and ability to handle some off-road riding, but they get quite loud as the speeds rise. As for braking, the move to an axial front brake caliper may seem like a downgrade, but the performance suits the bike well. Initial bite is dull, which is nice off-road, but the braking force ramps up well when you give the lever a harder squeeze. The braking performance on- and off-road is also bolstered by the intuitive ABS system, but for that we must move to the next topic – features. 2025 390 ADV uses an axial caliper but braking performance is still very good. KTM 390 Adventure features, design  The 390 is a very well-specced motorcycle. Its 5-inch TFT looks familiar but has excellent graphics and is controlled via the chunky switchgear on the left. The rear ABS and traction control can both be turned off very easily and the bike remembers your settings and keeps them that way, even after turning it off. Then there’s the aforementioned quick shifter as well as the segment-first cruise control that works quite well. TFT dash is well-laid out, intuitive and feature-rich. This is also the first Indian KTM to offer spoked wheels that support tubeless tyres. These wheels have a patented design that uses a rubber seal to make things air-tight. I imagine there must be some life span to this rubber component, and we’ve asked Bajaj to let us know about this. New design language inspired by KTM's Dakar Rally bikes. The new design theme inspired by the Dakar rally bikes is another improvement in my opinion, and while I still wouldn't call it a classically beautiful bike, it has a new found sense of purpose that I quite like. KTM has also switched to a new material for the bodywork that they say is similar to what's used on the international dirt bikes and is capable of taking much more abuse. The plastic is also pigmented, rather than stickered (including the graphics) which means that if it does get scratched, it will reveal the same colour underneath. KTM 390 Adventure price and verdict The new 390 Adventure offers a great balance of performance, capability, equipment and ease of use. That being said, it also commands a rather steep Rs 3.67 lakh, ex-showroom, and for those who find this to be too much of a leap over the Himalayan 450, the lower-spec 390 Adventure X may be more appealing. Either way, this bike is a huge leap forward for the 390 Adventure nameplate, and in many ways it's what we’d hoped that the original bike would be.  Also See: 2025 KTM 390 Adventure video review",

I kept adding compression damping till all 30 clicks were in on the fork, at which point the KTM was a lot more compliant off-road, but more skilled riders who intend to push this bike hard off-road will probably want to look at aftermarket options for changing the suspension’s spring weights and/or the damping rates.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-461f7b13-7fff-9d8b-cbab-9aa32cb9fd9c\"\u003eBut despite coming close to the limits of the stock suspension, it\u0026#39;s clear that this chassis manages to offer a light and friendly feel, but it is also up for quite a high level of off-road riding. I believe it manages this balance better than any similar rival on sale in India at the moment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-461f7b13-7fff-9d8b-cbab-9aa32cb9fd9c\"\u003eKTM 390 Adventure on-road handling\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-461f7b13-7fff-9d8b-cbab-9aa32cb9fd9c\"\u003eOn-road handling-wise, the same attributes that appealed off-road makes the difference. The light and agile nature extends to the way the motorcycle corners, and it\u0026#39;s a similar story of ease meeting confidence.

The Apollo Tramplr tyres are a good fit for the motorcycle in terms of their road grip and ability to handle some off-road riding, but they get quite loud as the speeds rise. As for braking, the move to an axial front brake caliper may seem like a downgrade, but the performance suits the bike well. Initial bite is dull, which is nice off-road, but the braking force ramps up well when you give the lever a harder squeeze. The braking performance on- and off-road is also bolstered by the intuitive ABS system, but for that we must move to the next topic – features.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20250227043521_5.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e2025 390 ADV uses an axial caliper but braking performance is still very good.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-461f7b13-7fff-9d8b-cbab-9aa32cb9fd9c\"\u003eKTM 390 Adventure features, design \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-461f7b13-7fff-9d8b-cbab-9aa32cb9fd9c\"\u003eThe 390 is a very well-specced motorcycle. Its 5-inch TFT looks familiar but has excellent graphics and is controlled via the chunky switchgear on the left. The rear ABS and traction control can both be turned off very easily and the bike remembers your settings and keeps them that way, even after turning it off. Then there’s the aforementioned quick shifter as well as the segment-first cruise control that works quite well.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20250227043338_3.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTFT dash is well-laid out, intuitive and feature-rich.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-461f7b13-7fff-9d8b-cbab-9aa32cb9fd9c\"\u003eThis is also the first Indian KTM to offer spoked wheels that support tubeless tyres. These wheels have a patented design that uses a rubber seal to make things air-tight. I imagine there must be some life span to this rubber component, and we’ve asked Bajaj to let us know about this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20250227043409_8.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNew design language inspired by KTM\u0026#39;s Dakar Rally bikes.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-461f7b13-7fff-9d8b-cbab-9aa32cb9fd9c\"\u003eThe new design theme inspired by the Dakar rally bikes is another improvement in my opinion, and while I still wouldn\u0026#39;t call it a classically beautiful bike, it has a new found sense of purpose that I quite like. KTM has also switched to a new material for the bodywork that they say is similar to what\u0026#39;s used on the international dirt bikes and is capable of taking much more abuse. The plastic is also pigmented, rather than stickered (including the graphics) which means that if it does get scratched, it will reveal the same colour underneath.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-461f7b13-7fff-9d8b-cbab-9aa32cb9fd9c\"\u003eKTM 390 Adventure price and verdict\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-461f7b13-7fff-9d8b-cbab-9aa32cb9fd9c\"\u003eThe new 390 Adventure offers a great balance of performance, capability, equipment and ease of use. That being said, it also commands a rather steep Rs 3.67 lakh, ex-showroom, and for those who find this to be too much of a leap over the Himalayan 450, the lower-spec 390 Adventure X may be more appealing. Either way, this bike is a huge leap forward for the 390 Adventure nameplate, and in many ways it\u0026#39;s what we’d hoped that the original bike would be. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-461f7b13-7fff-9d8b-cbab-9aa32cb9fd9c\"\u003eAlso See: \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-video-reviews/2025-ktm-390-adventure-video-review-434660\"\u003e2025 KTM 390 Adventure video review\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"tagged-articles-container-434691\"\u003e\u003cul id=\"tab-id-434691\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-vidhref-id-434691\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-videos-container-434691\"\u003eVideos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
