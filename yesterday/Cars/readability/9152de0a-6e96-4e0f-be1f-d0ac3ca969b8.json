  "text": "A plastic garden chair with cushions is not the best replacement for the driver's seat 1 hour ago by Thanos Pappas A man was caught driving an unfinished BMW 3-Series with no hood and no seats. Police officers found him sitting on a plastic garden chair with cushions for comfort. Officers issued a defect notice and traffic-related charges are expected via summons. Project cars are a labor of love, but until they’re properly roadworthy, they’re best kept off public streets. One 64-year-old man in Australia may have skipped that memo, as he was recently stopped for driving a classic BMW missing more than just a few essentials. Also: Exposed And Unapologetic Hyundai Palisade Driving Without Body Panels Fined By Police The vehicle in question, a burgundy E36-generation BMW 3-Series sedan, was spotted by Narre Warren police in Cranbourne North, a suburb southeast of Melbourne. Officers noticed the car around 3:15 p.m. on a Monday, primarily because it was missing its hood, prompting them to pull it over. A Closer Look Reveals More Missing Pieces Upon closer inspection, the police discovered that the car had no seats installed. Instead, the driver was sitting on a plastic garden chair using the seatbelt just for show. Photos show that he added a couple of cushions for comfort, but the setup was far from stable, as the chair legs were resting loosely on the carpet with no restraints. Driving a car with critical components missing is illegal in Australia. While the absence of the hood alone could result in a fine, the lack of a secure seat presented a serious safety risk. Even a low-speed crash or sudden maneuver could lead to a fatal accident. Strangely enough, aside from the missing parts, the rest of the car appeared to be in decent shape for its age. Victoria Police According to the police report, the driver knew that his car was not roadworthy, and claimed he was on his way to pick up parts. Unfortunately, that’s not a valid excuse, especially when something as basic as car seats could have been delivered and installed beforehand.

The man will now face traffic-related charges through a court summons. Let’s hope that next time he finds a safer and more legal way to complete his project car. Speaking of which, the E36 3-Series remained in production between 1990 and 2000 but retains a cult following due to its styling and balanced handling. BMW",
