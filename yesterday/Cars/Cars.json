    "description": "In the motorcycling world, the word ‘Daytona’ conjures up imagery of a modern-day icon that outdid its Japanese competition as it won seemingly countless championships in racing classes around the world. The Daytona 660 you see here is Triumph’s replacement to the original 675, but while that was a thoroughbred supersport bike built to dominate the race track, this is a relatively basic road bike that has been built to a budget. Hmm. Triumph Daytona 660: Design and features Kicking off on a positive note, I think Triumph has done well with the design, and in this shade of white, it even pulls off a more modern take on the Daytona vibe. The twin headlamps and sleek-looking fairing are striking, and while the tail section isn’t as sharp and pointy, this is a good-looking bike for sure. However, on a closer look, you’ll notice things you’d never have imagined on a bike with this name. The front brake, for example, uses a basic axial master cylinder and the suspension is completely unadjustable save for rear preload. Gets a basic display with three riding modes Then there’s the plastic cladding along the side that is meant to create the look of an aluminium chassis when what actually resides underneath is a simple steel tubular frame. As far as I can tell, that air intake between the headlamps doesn’t really feed the airbox either. But it’s when you sit on the new Daytona that you’ll fully realise just how different a bike this now is. Triumph Daytona 660: Ride and handling The riding position is surprisingly kind, and while there is definitely a sporty forward lean, there are no extremes. Even the footpeg placement is kinder than a Street Triple. The seat is spacious and comfy, the turning radius is reasonably tight, and the overall ergos are nothing like the old Daytona, where comfort was a completely alien concept. In fact, I’m quite sure that you will be in less pain on a Daytona 660 than pretty much every R15 owner out there. Rider seat is comfy and spacious The pleasantries continue as soon as you ride out of the showroom. I faced a one-and-a-half-hour ride home through the depths of Mumbai after collecting the test bike – something that’s usually an awful experience on a big sportbike. But a couple of minutes into the mess of Goregaon, I simply wasn’t feeling the pain I was bracing for, and that was largely thanks to the suspension. The riding position is kind enough that you can also consider using this bike as a sport tourer. Simply put, the Daytona 660’s suspension is astonishingly plush for a bike like this – even more so than Royal Enfield’s new Bear 650. There’s not a lot of suspension travel, so you do need to care for the rims. But it soaks in our rough, poorly built roads very well, and this is the first sportbike in a long time that I have looked forward to riding in the city. The few downsides are that it will throw hot air at you in heavy traffic, and there’s not a lot of ground clearance – so you need to be cautious over tall speed breakers. Triumph Daytona 660: Performance And now we arrive at the big question – does it ride like a Daytona should? At its core, this is a 3-cylinder Triumph that sings a sweet Moto2 song. So, to a small extent, the answer is yes. But mostly, the Daytona 660 is a far more mellow and gentle motorcycle than the OG 675. Since this bike is now based on the Trident 660, I was worried the performance would be a little too mellow, but Triumph has made some notable improvements that spice up the experience. Power has gone up by 14hp to 95hp, but more importantly, this engine now revs up to 12,600rpm, which makes it much more involving. 95hp is plenty, and this is a rapid motorcycle that can blast past 200kph in seconds, but it never feels aggressive. There is a new Sport mode that adds some much-needed crispness and response while keeping the throttle very easy to manage. The Daytona also sounds a little louder and more involving than the Trident, but just like that bike, it has a meaty torque band and allows you to lazily ride at lower speeds in higher gears. The 6-speed gearbox is also precise, and the shift feel is crisp and solid, like you’d expect from a big bike. However, you’ll have to pay about Rs 40,000 more if you’d like a quickshifter. The underbelly exhaust tune is slightly louder than the Trident 660. As for handling, the Daytona is good – but to an extent. It’s fun to ride on a winding road, and you can confidently carry plenty of corner speed once the grippy Michelin Power 6 tyres are warm enough. But the moment you start to ride aggressively, you’ll discover the compromise that comes with all that wonderful street comfort. At this point, the suspension feels too soft, particularly at the front under hard braking. The Daytona starts to feel unsettled if you push it too hard. Braking is good for quick street riding but not at supersport levels. The braking performance from the J.Juancalipers and Nissin master cylinder is strong enough for the way this bike likes to be ridden, but it is a noticeable step down in sharpness and outright performance compared to a pukka supersport. The same goes for the overall agility and steering sharpness; at 201kg, it’s also alittle heavier than a supersport600 should be. Triumph Daytona 660: Verdict At Rs 9.72 lakh, the Daytona costs about one and a half lakh more than the Trident, and I think it’s worth the extra money. This is a more special-looking bike, and it’s also much nicer to ride. But, on the other end of the spectrum, you have the Street Triple R, which is about Rs 40,000 more than this (or about the same as a Daytona 660 with a quickshifter) and offers more performance, equipment and premiumness. Clearly, then, extreme performance is not a reason to buy a Daytona 660, and if you are graduating from a sub-500cc bike in search of a sporty, aggressive machine that you can take to the track, this is not the bike for you. But for someone who wants a motorcycle that’s easy to live with, not a pain to ride, and looks and sounds like a sportbike, this thing hits the spot. It’ll blast past 200kph in seconds but never feels aggressive or intimidating to ride. There are undoubtedly a lot of people who are upset over Triumph using the Daytona name on this motorcycle. But if you can get past that, you’ll discover a motorcycle that is genuinely pleasant to ride even on our roads, while also giving you that special feel-good factor that can only be associated with a fully faired sportbike. And that is a rare thing indeed. Also see: Triumph Speed T4 road test, review",

    "description": "Ease of use. Practicality. Comfort. Fuel efficiency. These are some of the main driving forces that drive a scooterist’s purchase. The all-new Jupiter 110 made a strong case for itself when we sampled it for the first time at TVS’ test track a few months ago. While it undoubtedly left us impressed, the pertinent question is: how does it tackle the chaotic, staccato grind of a bustling city like Mumbai? Since the Jupiter 110 now uses the same main frame as the 125, it inherits some of its bigger sibling’s inherent trump cards, like the 33-litre boot (the largest on any Indian ICE scooter) and the handy (pun intended) apron-mounted fuel filler. Apron-mounted fuel filler is very convenient, but fuel can splash back. Both of these are highly appreciable features for a scooter – something no rival can match. As for the design, this is easily the most youthful 110cc family scooter out there, and the vibrant matte blue colour helps things further. 33-litre boot is one of the biggest USPs of the TVS Jupiter models. TVS has also given the Jupiter a first-in-class feature, an ISG (Integrated Starter Generator) that enables a very small performance boost (0.6Nm, to be precise) that can be used for a few seconds, about two times every minute before the system needs to recharge. LCD dash shows you a lot, but the empty space around it is an eyesore. On this top Disc SmartXonnect variant, there’s also a new Bluetooth-compatible LCD display (available only on the top two variants) with turn-by-turn navigation and other standard-issue features, such as average FE, two trip meters, a clock, and the like. Bluetooth connectivity brings in call and navigation alerts. Our only gripe here is that this is a tightly packed vertical display housed inside a horizontal surround, leaving a lot of black plastic on the sides, which we think can be used to show more info.   That minor gripe fades into the background once you thumb the starter, and the Jupiter silently comes to life. To ride, we believe it is one of the most impressive all-rounders in the entire sub-150cc scooter game today. And we’ll explain why. The Jupiter is a relaxed commuting partner. The lane that leads to our office is notorious for its cavalcade of potholes, uneven patchwork, and gutter covers, all waiting to wreak havoc on your back as well as the vehicle’s suspension. Happily, the Jupiter dealt with this stretch without much fuss, thanks to its well-judged suspension setup and contoured seat, both of which kept us comfortable. Suspension is well-judged, winged preload adjuster is very convenient. 110cc scooters aren’t meant to be the last word in handling, but the Jupiter is reassuringly planted and nimble, attributes that lend nicely to its overarching role as a family’s urban runabout. At 106kg, the Jupiter’s weight is more than manageable for most riders, and it is one of the easiest scooters to prop up on the centre stand.   A sleeved-down version of the Jupiter 125’s motor is on duty here, and this 113cc mill is rated for 8hp and 9.8Nm (0.6Nm of that comes from the ISG). It is a surprisingly peppy motor and makes this the quickest 110 we’ve tested yet – only 0.8 seconds slower than the Jupiter 125 in the 0-80kph sprint. This is one of the easiest scooters to prop up on the centre stand. While the iGo assist is very subtle in its execution, it must be adding to the performance, and we’d like to ride a base Jupiter without the system back-to-back to see how much of a difference it really makes. Braking is reassuringly strong on this top variant with the front disc, and the CBS works well enough. The front disc is exclusive to the top variant and the bite is good. Despite the zippy performance, the Jupiter 110 is also pleasantly frugal, and we managed to get near-identical efficiency figures on both the highway (57.30kpl) and in the city (56.93kpl). Some of the credit goes to the start/stop system, which kills the engine after a few seconds of idling, thus saving fuel at long signals or in traffic jams. The iGo assist will probably be helping here, too. While this engine is both fuel-efficient and refined, it doesn’t quite match the smoothness of Japanese scooters – although our scooter has barely done 700km, and this may smoothen out after a service. The new engine is both peppy and frugal but could be a little smoother. What we didn’t like was TVS’ start/stop tech, which could be quicker on its feet, too. It requires you to hold either brake lever and twist the accelerator to bring the engine to life once you want to get going. However, if you twist the throttle wide open for a quick traffic light getaway, the engine sputters and dies, sometimes refusing to start without pressing the starter button. To combat this, you need to let go of the throttle once the motor is on for a brief moment, and then twist the accelerator. While it does help with fuel efficiency, some of us preferred keeping the system off.   The previous Jupiter 110 was already a sorted package and with this model, TVS has polished its bestseller further. With its combination of exceptional practicality, appealing style, great fuel efficiency and nifty tech, it’s hard not to see why this new one has already become a common sight on our roads. It is the most well-rounded package among 110cc scooters. While certain features could be more refined in their execution, the scooter itself is, without question, impressive. You could always buy the base variant if things like start-stop and a fancy display are not important. The one thing we’d like to see is the front disc brake being made available on the lower variants. However, given that no other 110cc rival offers this feature on a lower variant, it’s not something we can complain about too much. The issue is that the top model is quite pricey – even more so than purchasing a mid-spec Jupiter 125 with a front disc. However, until the Jupiter 125 gets a similar update, we can see plenty of people going for the top-spec 110 just for the way it looks.",

    "description": "The electric car is perfectly noiseless and clean. There is no smell or vibration, and they should become very useful when fixed charging stations can be arranged. But for now, I do not anticipate that they will be very serviceable – at least for many years to come.” Sounds like the predicament we’re in today, doesn’t it? The EVs themselves are sound, but the infrastructure isn’t quite there yet. However, that statement wasn’t made by some industry pundit in Germany, a senator from Washington or a tech genius from Silicon Valley. Those are the prescient words of Charles Rolls, co-founder of Rolls-Royce. And they were spoken in the year 1900. You see, both Rolls and Sir Henry Royce were big proponents of all things electrified. They made dynamos and electric motors for cranes and championed other brands’ forays into electric cars, but before committing their own initials to an EV, they were determined to get it absolutely right. It wouldn’t be until the Phantom-based 102EX of 2011 – a concept that featured, among much else, wireless car charging – that Rolls-Royce first showed proper intent. But still, it wasn’t ready. 2011’s 102EX concept first previewed what a Rolls EV could be. It wouldn’t be for another 11 years – and finally in 2022 – that we got our first glimpse of the Spectre, an EV that didn’t take the form of a traditional saloon car or a more contemporary two-box SUV. No, it was a swooping two-door, four-seat coupé, which is  just as well for the relative aerodynamic benefits that are so important for an EV. But it was more to make a statement that an electric Rolls-Royce could at once be luxurious, dynamic and uncompromising. Rolls Royce Spectre exterior design This Dark Emerald example wafted silently into view under an autumnal sunset in Aix-en-Provence in the south of France. We have dinner scheduled soon, so my potential drive time is running out, but I can’t help myself from having a walk around and taking it all in. And it’s quite a walk: 5.5 metres from prow to stern (as long as a Maybach S-Class) and over two metres wide, mirror to mirror. Huge 23-inch wheels don’t look out of place here, and despite all the mass, its fastback roof that stretches down to the tail allows it to look sleek, more so if you specify it in a contrasting colour. This is the most aerodynamic Rolls ever, with a 0.25 Cd, and you can see that in the laid-back grille, steeper-raked windscreen, and even a unique ‘Spirit of Ecstasy’ hood ornament that hunkers lower than the regular lady. Most aerodynamic Pantheon grille ever. The hood ornament is tipped forward, too. As I carefully swing the rear-hinged coach door open – power-assisted, of course – I’m quickly reminded once again of how big the car actually is, as its wingspan takes up half a parking slot. They’re probably the largest doors I’ve seen on a car, so much so that they get their own customisation options – like huge expanses of wood veneer and even the LED-ingrained ‘starlight’ option otherwise reserved for the roof liner. Closing the doors is an easier – and cooler – endeavour, requiring just a press of the brake pedal for the motorised slab to swing shut; don’t worry, it will stop if it detects an obstacle. Rolls Royce Spectre interior and features As the door clicks shut, it suddenly feels like I’m in a sound vacuum, and using my remaining senses, I soak in the grandeur of the interior. It’s somewhat anticlimactic to find it’s exactly the same as every other Rolls – a few angles and surfaces aside – but that should hardly be a complaint, should it? It isn’t futuristic for the sake of it – a trend legacy carmakers often fall prey to when they make an EV. No, the Spectre’s interior is traditional, sumptuous and excessive, just like those of its stablemates. And it’s all real – from the wood to the metal to the leather. I even welcome back my sense of hearing by flicking the AC vent to listen to its characteristic metallic ‘clang’. A detail I love is the ‘Spectre’ wordmark on the passenger side of the dash, surrounded by a galaxy of ‘stars’, which are not painted or engraved but instead made of individual lighting elements set at different depths inside the dashboard, making for a literal three-dimensional art piece. Massive doors get their own customisation. However, make no mistake. This is still the most cutting-edge Rolls ever, and there’s a lot of tech underneath it all, including some debuts like fully digital dials and the latest generation of ‘Spirit’ infotainment system with connected car tech and ADAS features, but it’s designed to never feel overbearing. For example, the auto climate control doesn’t give temperature readouts or numerical fan speeds; a dial simply goes from red to blue, and another goes from ‘soft’ to ‘max’. And yes, there are plenty of physical buttons still, once again proving that real luxury doesn’t bow down to trends that don’t have any real benefit to a customer. Rear seats are big and comfy enough for adults. Two doors but four windows. It’s almost become de rigueur to dismiss the rear seats of any two-door coupé as being, at best, just for kids and, at worst, completely unusable. But this is a Rolls-Royce, so, of course, that isn’t the case. The front seats motor forward a fair bit, but it’s still a bit awkward getting past the coach door into the rear of the cabin. Once you do, though, there’s more space here than most four-door sedans and considerably more luxury. There’s four-zone climate control, too, and while rear passengers don’t get their own doors, they can open their own frameless windows. Perhaps some of this space could have been apportioned to the boot, which, at 380 litres – hampered more than likely by the battery pack – is not a whole lot for such a vast vehicle and will undoubtedly hurt its grand touring credentials. Rolls Royce Spectre range, battery and performance No frunk under long bonnet, just a silver shroud. What would potentially hurt it more is its WLTP range of 530 kilometres, despite its big 102kWh battery. The real-world figure could be considerably less, too, judging by the rate at which the readout recedes on my short drive, because 0.25 Cd aside, this is still a 2.9-tonne car. Sure, the V12 cars aren’t noted for their efficiency either, but at least they can be refilled quickly. Should you find a fast-enough charger, the Spectre can feed from a DC plug at up to 195kW, with 10-80 percent being recovered in a claimed 32 minutes. But there’s more to the story than just that, as I will soon find out. The Spectre is, in some way, the trickiest Rolls to get comfortable with, as I discover while negotiating an oblique sloped U-turn out of our hotel. The seats are low, the dash is high, the windscreen is slim, and worst of all, the nose dips out of view. I can only see the wingtips of the Flying Lady. I nurse it through the tiny town at the bottom of the hill, which is already shutting shop for the night, wondering if I should have just ended my review with that walkaround. Those big wheels wobbling over the cobblestones are only raising my anxiety levels, but as I finally make it onto an open road, it starts becoming clear. The Rolls-atypical raked windscreen and dipped bonnet make it tricky to position easily. As with the interior, this powertrain was intended to be a Rolls first and an EV second. To that end, the power delivery has something few other EVs do – a personality. It’s not an on/off switch like the EVs of old, nor is it perfectly linear like most new ones. It grows and swells, like a locomotive building steam, making for a sensation that’s simultaneously familiar and also unlike anything else. It does a spot-on impression of the effortless excess you get with the V12, albeit smoother still. Sound? It’s digital, of course – an ethereal hum that’s meant to evoke “an orchestra tuning up”. You can turn this off, but even so, they had to engineer some noise in; 700kg of sound deadening made the Spectre so silent that, during development, it was reportedly making people ill! Instead of ‘Low’ in the V12s, the button on the drive stalk says ‘B’, which, like in BMW’s EVs, cranks up both the regen and the power delivery. A quick, firm prod brings the horizon to me, as all 585hp and 900Nm are deployed with the ferocity of the fastest electric cars. It’s a bit unbecoming, so I switch out of it at once, but on the topic, an engineer did reveal that when it’s time for the inevitable Black Badge Spectre, all they’ll need is a laptop to release the extra performance. The hardware has plenty more to give. It covers ground with the hushed effortlessness expected of a Rolls. Wider roads and higher speeds reveal there is some dynamism to this near-three-tonne coupé, as it reins its mass in well through some flowing bends. The trick, planar suspension has already proven that it can manage heavy weights with grace and ease, and the floaty behaviour at low speeds settles down admirably as you go faster. What’s only amplified by the silent powertrain, unfortunately, is the road noise, which on a less-than-stellar surface will always filter in; perhaps a size-down to 22-inch wheels will help. Rolls Royce Spectre price and verdict With the sun now firmly behind the hills, I have to rush back for that dinner, and I realise I’m way more comfortable with the Spectre. I lean on it while entering and exiting roundabouts, and even the treacherous village from before is despatched in a breeze. As I hoof it up the hill, I’m convinced more than ever that the ultimate application for EVs is luxury. Wide 23-inch wheels can be felt on bad surfaces. Range will improve with time and tech, but the blend of refinement and effortlessness is something batteries do even better than petrol. And as the Spectre has shown, there can be character, too. Of course, this level of boundary-pushing doesn’t come cheap, and Rs 7.62 crore (ex-showroom, before options) is what it will set you back by. But in the stratosphere of the market, price matters little if the experience is up to the mark. EVs have been the great equaliser of the car industry. They have democratised the powertrain across various price points, which forces the rest of the vehicle to excel in order to stand out. What the Spectre does is debunk that theory by delivering not only an exceptional Rolls-Royce but an exceptional EV as well. The time has finally come.

    "title": "Does it really matter how I pronounce Hyundai?",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/does-it-really-matter-how-i-pronounce-hyundai",
    "description": "Hyundai has taken to TV advertising to explain how people should say its name It took two British advertising students writing directly to then Nike CEO Philip Knight to draw confirmation of how to pronounce the sports equipment brand’s name properly. In 2014, 50 years after Knight and Bill Bowerman had founded Blue Ribbon Sports, which would in 1971 be renamed Nike (after the Greek god of victory), the students sent Knight a letter, along with a stamped and addressed return envelope. It contained just two paragraphs, asking Knight to simply circle the correct way to say the company’s name: ‘Nike’ or ‘Ni-ke’. It was reported at the time that they hadn’t expected a reply but, a few weeks later, got their letter back. Knight had circled ‘Ni-ke’. As far as I can tell, this is the only time that Nike has been drawn into the pronunciation game. Searches on the wider web and Nike’s own pages for tips or official statements draw a blank. The short of it is that it’s possible to build one of the world’s 10 most recognisable brands, a company that takes in $50 billion a year and employs 80,000 people while simultaneously not worrying that in some countries people will pronounce its name incorrectly. And so, reader, to Hyundai, which, if you’re a regular radio listener, you will have heard advising an actor, and by association you, on how to say its name right. Like Hyacinth Bucket answering the phone with a highfalutin ‘The Bouquet residence’, it’s not ‘High-oond-aye’, it’s ‘He-oon-day’, the advert says. There’s only a little attention given to the ‘y’, as the first two syllables are slurred towards one.  Hyundai says it would like to be called the same thing, correctly, worldwide. Although if you go to the US, residents don’t usually mention the ‘y’ at all, making it a two-syllable ‘Hunday’ – a situation about which, in Nike fashion, nobody seems to mind. Not like they seem to in the UK, anyway, as the ad pushes its glasses up its nose and begins ‘akshually…’ before embarking on the correction and, here’s the thing, telling the listener precious little about any of its cars as it does so. What luxury to be able to launch a Jaguar-lite advert intent on telling one who the company is rather than trying to actually sell them something it makes. Why is Hyundai doing this? Why does it so borderline passive-aggressively care how one pronounces its name and why does it remotely think we care what it’s called? I mean, look, I’m expected to get its name right, because it’s part of my gig. But as for the general consumer, as Mark Ritson wrote in Marketing Week: “Understanding the utter lack of importance a brand plays in the life of its customers is the beginning of better brand management.” Advertising agency DDB’s Sarah Carter once put it more bluntly still. Marketers “should have Post-it notes on their desks saying: ‘Consumers don’t give a shit. People’s indifference to brands and advertising should be the starting point,’” she said. We have bills to pay. Work to go to. Children to take places. Parents who need care. Fun to have. Food to cook. Places to be. Illnesses to put right. We have lives. What significance do you think I allot to how a faceless corporation pronounces its name? I have some milk going out of date tomorrow. In terms of how much I care, it’s way, way below that. The fact is, people in different places might pronounce things differently. If that’s a person’s name, sensitivity says we should try to get it right. If it’s a brand, shrug emoji. Besides, it’s complicated. Technically Skoda is Shkoda, Porsche is Porscher and Ikea is Ekaya. The chances of me saying those right depend not just on me knowing and remembering but also whether it makes me sound like a divot.  And even FC Bayern München, a sports team rather than a corporation, knows to call itself ‘Bayern Munich’ internationally, rather than harrumphing about why the English translate ‘München’ but not, say, ‘Napoli’. Nike apparently thinks, as the cliché and sometime song lyric goes, ‘I don’t care what you call me, so long as you call me’. Quite right, too. I will call you what I want. Sell me a car.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/alfa-romeo/giulia-quadrifoglio/long-term-reviews/2500-miles-513bhp-giulia-quadrifoglio",
    "description": "If you're in the market for a super-saloon, should you be going Italian? You jammy sod. Those three words flashed up on my phone from a friend barely five minutes after I posted an image to Instagram. Out of context, this would perhaps seem weird. But the picture in question was of this sumptuous Etna Red Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio. My friend is a big Alfa Romeo fan – and he says it how it is. And I guess that some of you may have thoughts similar to my friend's. And you’re right because the £78,195 Giulia QV is quite the car: 513bhp and rear-wheel drive but with seating for five and a good-sized boot. I am conscious about coming across as smug in these reports, though, so I’ll be borrowing a bit of humility from my favourite American billionaire. I’m a big admirer of Warren Buffett. The 94-year-old is at the time of writing the world’s sixth-richest person and CEO of a huge multinational conglomerate called Berkshire Hathaway. He doesn’t seem the type of person you’d particularly like to go to dinner with – until you read his letters to his shareholders. He’s wonderfully dry, funny, and self-effacing. In the 1980s Buffett bought a private jet and named it ‘The Indefensible’ in a letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, who had essentially paid for it. I feel similar here: I promise to enjoy and drive the Alfa as if you were doing it yourself. Anyway, the reason we’re running one in the first place is that Alfa’s sports car-baiting saloon has had an update. It receives a 10bhp boost, a straightforward mechanical limited-slip diff (rather than an e-diff), matrix LED lights, a new grille mesh, and new digital dials. Ostensibly, I’m going to see if that has made a difference and how it fits in a marketplace that is moving so quickly. But I’m also going to answer a few questions. The first being: do the Italians do it better? At this stage, I have yet to put mega-miles on the car. But it is very different from the offerings from AMG, RS, and M. For a start, it is nothing short of beautifully set up for our broken Great British roads. I love the way you can set the driving mode to ‘angry’ with a twist of a dial, then immediately set the dampers to soft with a button on the same dial. Both ergonomically sensible and a satisfying thing to do. I can’t quite believe I’m writing this, but I also need to answer the question of ‘is the Giulia QV actually quite good value?’ News has just come through that the new Audi SQ5 will cost £75,000. The Audi is a bit more practical, of course, but its V6 is 150bhp down on the Alfa’s and it is a much less exciting and less exotic prospect. Then we have the expense of fairly mundane EVs, on which I won’t waste column inches here. The final and perhaps most intriguing subject of investigation is the engine. In my short time with the Alfa I have already fielded numerous questions from very knowledgeable industry people about the engine’s origins. Alfa’s engineers have described the all-aluminium unit as being ‘inspired’ by Ferrari’s 3.9-litre twin-turbo V8: both motors share a 90deg bank angle, cylinder bore and stroke measurements and a turbocharger supplier. There’s also Maserati’s Nettuno V6. I’ve experienced it a fair bit in our MC20 long-termer, and I think they feel and sound pretty different. But there’s no denying that both also share that 90deg bank angle and the same 8000rpm limit. Just how closely related are they? But that’s all food for future reports. How am I getting on with the Quad so far? Brilliantly, thank you. I’ll write more about the delightful way it drives later; in the meantime, I have been dealing with a few quite Italian quirks. That new digital display behind the steering wheel is configurable and can change depending on which driving mode you’re in. I like the option that’s modelled on classic Alfa dials: it is truly fantastic. Like a classic Alfa, but it’s all reliable, works consistently and can tell you important things, such as the fuel economy. Except there’s one enormous quirk. The ‘miles to empty gauge’ in the bottom left corner ticks down with a very satisfying animation. It’s great to watch but is almost useless: it theatrically tells you the miles to empty is changing, but of course cars have different ways of calculating this. It goes up as well as down; and it’s not like it diligently ticks down mile by mile, or every five miles. It seemingly spits out random numbers at will, with no rhyme or reason why or when. The infotainment is a bit naff, too. Yes, reader, I am a millennial. And, yes, I am complaining about the touchscreen in my 513bhp Italian super-saloon. The screen itself is fine – at 8.8in it’s a good deal smaller than the Germans’. But I really don’t care that much. The graphics are also a bit behind the Germans in terms of cleanliness, and the UX (user experience if you’re wondering) is behind the curve. Again, no biggie for me. But what has annoyed me so far is the lack of wireless Apple CarPlay. It’s a minor foible, but the whole plugging in, taking it out, making the wire and phone fit in the box situated in the armrest is a tad annoying. Maybe it will irritate me less over time. Update 2 Road test editor Matt Saunders wrote a brilliant piece about Polestar's head of chassis development, Joakim Rydholm, in which he made a point about not allowing national stereotypes to get in the way of fair judgement. Anyway, my Alfa Romeo has broken down a bit. With the benefit of hindsight, I think this tale begins in Wales. I had just crossed over the border when an unwanted bong nudged my attention. \"Check Airbag \" and \"SOS Call Error\" messages hung around like turds in a pool, but after around 10 minutes the warnings disappeared and I was left alone with my thoughts, the Alfa's V6 and the sheep. To be perfectly honest, when I got back to London, I forgot about the warning bongs and promptly went on holiday. I lent the car to my colleague Jack Warrick and he had the same issues. He then lent it to Classic \u0026 Sports Car's Aaron McKay, who had some real issues. He needed some wheels to get him to his grandad's 80th birthday bash over in Wales, and while it whisked him along the M4 fine, getting home wasn't so easy. On the Saturday, a burst of well-known warning lights and bongs alerted him to some mysterious malady. It was still upset on the Sunday morning when some unknown turmoil had managed to drain the battery and sound the alarm. Aaron couldn't get a response from jump leads on the boot-mounted battery. The local mechanic managed to find the positive terminal under the bonnet, but even he needed an extra battery to boost his Ford Transit to get the Alfa to turn over  Good news: the Alfa lived. Bad news: it was stuck in limp home mode, with only around 150bhp. Aaron battled through, and once the car was back into England, it cleared its error codes and allowed normal driving again. My theory? The Alfa hates Wales. Perhaps it's a huge rugby fan and wanted to hammer home the 24-21 win for Italy that resulted in Wales first Six Nations wooden spoon in 21 years. Perhaps it's just bad luck. Or perhaps you actually can let a touch of national stereotypes cloud your judgements on cars. Update 3  I bet you own, or have owned, a classic car. Or a weekend car. Or something along those lines. I certainly have. An NA MX-5. Eventually life got in the way and I got rid of it when in one year it accrued a measly 200 miles.   As I approach my mid-thirties, I seemingly have even less time to enjoy cars. But a few weeks ago something marvelous happened. Plans that had been in the diary for months disappeared. Whoosh. Just gone. A whole Saturday deleted with just a day’s notice.  In my mind’s to-do list there is a post-it note fluttering around, its adhesive quality slowly being lost over the two years since I moved into my flat and placed it there. It reads “find a good driving road near me”. And today, I am finally gripping that day-glow yellow square between my thumb and forefinger and putting it in the bin. Of my mind. But I couldn’t just get into the Etna Red Quad, thumb the big starter switch, twist the drive selector to Dynamic and press the soft suspension button that is nestled between said twister. No, I, like any Millenial, had to consult Google first. I point blank refuse to tackle any task, no matter how small, inconsequential or seemingly easy before Googling it. Eventually after wading through AI drivel, I stumbled across a very old post that mentioned some specific parts of Essex, close-ish to where I live, so I headed there. It was a crisp, clear, brown-hued Autumn day and the Alfa really felt alive once I got it out of the 30mph zones. When I got to some A and B roads, with the engine warmed up and exhaust valves open and growling, I really began to feel where the Quad is at its best. It’s all pretty mechanical and visceral too; not dissimilar from a classic if you can get the lane assist and stop-start bypassed in your mind. The Autumn leaves and mud elicited a few scrabbles for traction, a true hallmark of going for a drive in my eyes, and the Quad’s steering ebbed and flowed, tightened and loosened up so naturally I felt as comfortable ringing its neck as if I was driving something much less powerful and spiky. It would be remiss of me to not mention the state of the UK roads here. Turning right at a countryside T junction allowed me to test the Alfa’s quick steering. Two and a quarter turns between locks gives me enough manoeuvrability to pick a course, avoiding the worst of the massive holes I encountered. And at speed, the Alfa, with the soft spring button engaged, is masterful here, almost skipping over these defects. My colleague Matt Saunders, as ever, was correct when he wrote “On a good smooth surface the Giulia is fine in its firmest mode, while on broken surfaces it’s ideally planted in its softer mode.” In the UK of course,  a good smooth surface is increasingly hard to find.Fittingly, on the way home a chap in a Black Quad flashed his lights at me and waved, and I returned the favour. Like a classic car owner. But unlike with a classic, I don’t need to store the Alfa in a garage. I still haven’t quite found a brilliant driving route near me. Which means that post-it note remains flapping around in my mind, but I guess it also gives me another excuse to go out and find a great driving road. The addendum to this is that since this brilliant drive things have not been so rosy for the Alfa. The Monday after the cancelled Saturday I drove it into our Twickenham office so that I could lend it to my learned colleague Kris Culmer. Being in standstill traffic on the North Circular pre 0700 was pretty hard to stomach, but not much could bring my spirits down after the weekend I’d had. Until a message from Kris arrived that evening. The Alfa had broken down within 2 miles of the office. A parking brake fault, complete with a new error message. Oh Alfa. Final update  Right, then, strap in: we have a lot to get through here. I'll address the question of whether I'd have a QV over something more German shortly. First I just wanted to offer a brief chronology of the car's time at Autocar. It arrived. It was summer. The sun was shining and the V6 was singing. Life was good. Before long, deputy road test editor Richard Lane needed the car to be in Wales for a feature that also involved an Alpine A110 and a Maserati MC20 and I obliged happily. The drive west to Wales was magnificent - especially when I dipped off the motorway and onto the A5. The direct, tight steering and supple suspension made mincemeat of the topography. But almost as soon as I entered Wales, I got the first warning lights. Yes, plural. I got distracted by the scenery, and the next time I looked down the warning lights had gone. I drove home, without issue. Shortly after, I lent the Quadrifoglio to staff writer Jack Warrick for two weeks while I was on holiday. Jack became miffed with the fuel economy and handed the keys to colleague Aaron McKay, who works on Autocar's sibling publication Classic \u0026 Sports Car. During Aaron's time with the car, he drove it to Wales, where it again began misbehaving. They were the same issues I'd experienced. Except... Aaron returned to it one night to discover it had a completely flat battery. D'oh. But it was nothing an AA van couldn't fix. Aaron drove the car from Wales to London and deposited it on our carpark's naughty step. All the while, it transpired that the Alfa's plates had been cloned and some wrong un had been milling around Shoreditch, London, in a pre-facelift Giulia Quadrifoglio collecting parking fines and accruing congestion charge tickets. I returned from a relaxing trip away to find all these problems, but even if it eroded my holiday calm I couldn't be cross at the Alfa. Not least because the hard reset had got rid of the various warning lights. Fast forward a month or so and the Alfa had been acting impeccably, so I lent it to chief sub editor Kris Culmer. But it developed a handbrake fault immediately. That was just a week or so before but was due to go back to Alfa. But this is Alfa ownership. It was never going to be like having a Toyota Corolla. And I truly love it for that. The Quadrifoglio is a supremely special thing. We're in a bit of a last hurrah for the combustion engine and I just know that classic car magazines in 30 years will have special editions dedicated to this car, with pages specifically on the engine. The ride has a fluency that no other super-saloon matches, and after more than 2500 miles this was the thing that for me simply never wore off. A good chunk of those miles were completed on the motorway, and if you discount the mpg, it was extremely good at that. After every long journey, I couldn't help getting out, looking at the car's mean 19in alloys, low ride height and carbon fibre spoiler and just thinking: it should not be this comfortable; it shouldn't be this easy for a 191mph car to do what it just did. Sure, the fuel economy (23.5mpg test average) is hard to overlook. And truth be told, it was a bit of a pain for me. But frankly, the typical Giulia Quadrifoglio owner will be better off than I am, and a typical Alfa Romeo owner would realistically be willing to make allowances anyway. The Alfa isn't exactly the rational choice, when BMW M3s and Mercedes-AMG C63s are still brilliant while being a bit more reliable and cheaper to run. But I'll put it this way. How often do you see an M or AMG being driven poorly? Or see an M or AMG with ghastly modifications? Or see an M or AMG owner and just think: \"I wouldn't like to go round theirs for dinner because they will serve something unpalatable and have crap wine?\" Whereas with a Quadrifoglio owner, I just don't think those things. So then. The Quad. I had very high expectations and it was as brilliant, as thrilling and as perilous as I thought the experience might be. Only, slightly more comfortable and slightly more expensive.

Powering the motorcycle is a 1,103cc Desmosedici Stradale V4 engine, which is now Euro5+ certified. Compared to the outgoing model, it delivers 216hp at 13,500rpm – just a 0.5hp increase but at 500rpm higher. The peak torque is down by 2.7Nm to 120.9Nm and is delivered 1,750rpm later than the outgoing model at 11,250rpm. Suspension duties are managed by Öhlins, featuring the smart EC 3.0 electronic units. Ducati claims it has refined the rear monoshock to shed 600 grams of weight. The bike rides on the new Pirelli Diablo Supercorsa V4 tyres; the sizes remain at 120/70-ZR17 and 200/60-ZR17. This supersport is the first motorcycle in the world to feature the new Brembo Hypure monobloc calipers. The earlier model used Stylema calipers for braking.  The Ducati Panigale V4 for 2025 has received substantial updates in the form of design and internal reworking, marking the biggest change since the model debuted in 2018. The headlights are sleeker, and the refreshed tail-light has two U-shaped LED strips. The aerodynamics have also been reworked. There’s a redesigned fairing, and the winglets have been repositioned while providing the same amount of downforce as before. After a long hiatus, Ducati has equipped the Panigale V4 with a conventional double-sided swingarm. The last Ducati flagship supersport to get this type of swingarm was the iconic 916. The new swingarm-rear wheel assembly is 2.7 kg lighter, and the bike now features 37 percent less lateral stiffness, improving overall handling. In typical Ducati fashion, its flagship is loaded with electronic rider aids. The 2025 Panigale V4 debuts a new feature called Race eCBS, which essentially manages the rear load without the need to tap the rear brake – all thanks to a system that monitors the bike’s lean angle, throttle position and intervening when required. Additionally, the bike has power modes, traction control, launch control, wheelie control, riding modes, a bi-directional quickshifter and ABS. Each of these electronic aids offers extensive customisation via a new 6.9-inch TFT display.  The Ducati Panigale V4’s chief rival is the BMW S 1000 RR, which was also recently updated and launched at the 2025 edition of the Bharat Mobility Global Expo. The outgoing Ducati Panigale V4 commands Rs 27.72 lakh for the base model and Rs 33.48 lakh for the up-spec S variant, but we expect an increase in prices.

    "description": "Alpina has taken the wraps off its most powerful model, the B8 GT based on the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe. The B8 GT comes with an uprated version of the 4.4-litre V8 engine and will likely be Alpina’s last model as a standalone tuner as the company becomes a part of BMW as per a 2022 agreement. Alpina B8 GT gets 634hp and 850Nm of torque Its claimed 0-100kph time is 3.3 seconds Production will be limited to 99 units Powering the B8 GT is BMW’s 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol engine that makes 634hp at 5,500-6,500rpm and 850Nm of peak torque at 3,500-5,000rpm. Interestingly, the output figure is 1hp less than the M5 CS, and the B8 GT is just 0.4 seconds slower to sprint from 0-100kph than BMW’s sporty four-door sedan. Alpina also claims a 0-200kph time of 10.5 seconds and a top speed of 330kph. The tuning brand has tweaked the ZF-sourced 8-speed automatic gearbox to handle the extra torque. Alpina says the B8 GT production is capped at 99 units, and only 20 will get a dual-tone paint scheme that combines a blue or green finish with a contrasting black. All units will sport a subtle carbon fibre body kit, including a more prominent rear diffuser, forged 21-inch alloy wheels, bespoke Pirelli P Zero tyres, special badges, a leather and wood interior and a metal insert in the cup holder bearing founder Burkard Bovensiepen’s signature. Bovensiepen passed away in October 2023 at the age of 87.

BMW updates the R18 for 2025, while an incredibly rare American-made board tracker pops up at the Mecum Las Vegas auction. Ducati Diavel by Mandrill Garage When Ducati unveiled the new Diavel V4, we knew that the Ducati Diavel V2’s time was limited. To mark the occasion, Ducati China approached Luo Hao and the team at Mandrill Garage to give the V2 a proper sendoff with a bespoke Diavel V2 custom. And what a sendoff it is. The goal was to preserve the original character of the sporty power cruiser but elevate the design to something bold and exclusive.…",

In addition to hanging low on the bike and being exposed to all the debris and grime on the pavement, they also have to deal with high temperatures and constant heat cycles. Repeated heating and cooling will tarnish the best finishes on the market, and eventually, you’ll need to know how to restore your motorcycle exhaust pipes. Pipes are made from stainless, mild steel and even titanium, and stock finishes can be everything from chrome to polish, powder coat and paint. The point is that you’ll need to know a few details about your pipes before proceeding, along with your budget and abilities.…",

    "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJDrjdXmFeI Dave will be the first one to tell you his ’67 Shelby GT350 isn’t period correct. But when it comes to ticking the boxes of what truly matters, concours rules don’t even make the list. This car is more than a restoration; it’s the embodiment of perseverance, sacrifice, and a vision he held onto for decades. As a teenager, Dave watched the GT350 roll past his gas station, driven by a Vietnam veteran who had bought it brand new. To Dave, it wasn’t just a car; it was a rolling symbol of freedom and individuality. He knew, deep down, it would be his someday. That day came in 1973 when, after a few changes of ownership, he finally made the dream a reality. As it inevitably tends to do, life came by and happened. Marriage, family, and the responsibilities of adulthood meant the GT350 got pushed off to the back of his mind. Still, Dave never let go of the vision he had when he disassembled the car in 1976. Thirty years later, with his family’s support, he finally turned his attention back to the car, not to build a concours queen but to create something deeply personal.  “This car is not necessarily period correct.” Dave says, “It's not a concours car, but it's a hell of a machine because I built it the way I want it.” It took two years of bodywork, engine rebuilds, and assembly. He meticulously archived every bolt and part, documenting every detail as he blended authentic elements with personal touches to craft a machine that fulfills the longing he felt all those years ago watching it cruise by the station. Plenty of people want a factory-spec restoration, a polished time capsule built to live on manicured grass instead of asphalt. Instead Dave built something that embodies everything he values most: hard work, sacrifice, family, and the passion to see something through, no matter how long it takes. It’s not correct by concours standards, but it’s real by every measure that counts. For Dave, that’s all it ever needed to be. Continue...",

    "description": "The attraction to automobiles does not always pertain entirely to a physical quality. Sure, a car’s design, or its smell, or its sound can be part of that attraction, but a bigger part lies within something more abstract. If there was ever anyone who could relate to such an emotion, it would be Rob Simon. His steed of choice has been, and always will be, the legendary BMW E30 M3. In the automotive space, the legendary Bavarian warrior needs no introduction or backstory. It has long been heralded as one of the most exceptional machines ever sculpted by mankind, offering a pure driving experience unmarred by unnecessary aids or features. Despite a near-death experience in his red E30 M3, Rob always lusted for another one. It wasn’t just the behind-the-wheel time he longed for but the deeper, unspoken connection it wove between him, his father, and his brother, all of which had E30 M30s of their own. That chance would thankfully arise once more, but not in the way he would expect. Tune in to the Petrolicious YouTube channel and relive Rob Simon’s BMW E30 M3 tale alongside us.
