    "description": "TVS never stops updating its flagship 310cc models, and for 2025, the naked RTR 310 gets some small visual and electronic changes. The overall character of the bike remains unchanged, but these additions have made a noticeable improvement to the refinement of the riding experience. TVS Apache RTR 310 Design and Features - 9/10 India’s most feature rich bike gains some new tech The visual changes are limited to new handguards with aluminium frames, sequential turn indicators and a new transparent clutch cover like on the RR 310. There are also four new colours, although two of these will cost you extra; more on prices later.  The keyless fob is part of the Dynamic Pro Kit. The final physical feature addition is a keyless start and handlebar system, which is available on one of the two optional BTO (Built to Order) packages. However, there are multiple electronic changes as well.  Even the base variant comes standard with a TFT display. The 5-inch TFT display gets some revisions to its display layout. For the most part, it operates well, although there is a bit of a delay between your request for a riding mode change and the screen acknowledging it. One optional extra that is no longer available is the cooled seat. It was a great attempt at a valuable feature, but the comfort factor was a problem that couldn’t be solved. The new Apache RTR 310 otherwise continues to be a sharp and handsome motorcycle with an aggressively raked rear seat, an aluminium subframe and a powerful LED headlamp. TVS Apache RTR 310 Engine and Performance - 8/10 Still packs stronger performance than the spec sheet suggests, but with some improvements One of the most significant upgrades here is that TVS has recognised that the RTR 310 felt a little ‘untamed’ and has worked on increasing the smoothness of the throttle response. The company has created what it calls torque filtering, whereby the ride-by-wire system monitors not only how much the throttle is open but also how quickly it has been opened and then decides on the engine response accordingly. In function, it works quite well because the throttle response in city traffic, even in Sport mode, is now smoother and more predictable. The previous RTR was fun, but it never felt like it wanted to settle into a calmer state, which could get tiresome on a daily commute. Now, the bike feels more relaxed when you want, but the system gives you great response when you ask for it with a quicker throttle opening. TVS has achieved the objective of smoothing the throttle response, but the feeling of the system remains quite synthetic, and it lacks the natural feel of a throttle cable.  The clear clutch case adds to its style quotient. The addition of launch control is a new feature, and while it’s hardly something people will use often, it is a fun gimmick to have. Another electronic aid is Drag Torque Control, which basically assists the slip/assist clutch in smoothing out multiple aggressive downshifts. This is something already seen on some big bikes, and it opens the throttle valve slightly to feed the engine a small amount of fuel, which counteracts the reverse torque coming from the wheel under hard downshifts. Again, this is something most customers won’t notice, but you can switch the system off in the menus, and there is a perceptible difference in the smoothness at the rear wheel when hammering in three or four fast downshifts. The 312cc engine is otherwise mostly the same, and it remains at 35.6hp, unlike the RR 310 that was recently bumped up to 38hp. What has changed is that the RTR 310’s final drive gearing now matches the RR 310, which means the rear sprocket size has reduced by four teeth. The bike is still quite short-geared in nature but no longer excessively so. Its overall styling remains unchanged, barring a few small additions. Performance and refinement levels from this 4-valve liquid-cooled engine are largely the same since the last update in 2024, when TVS worked on reducing the perceptible vibrations. This is an exciting and quick-revving motor, and you will still feel varying levels of buzzing in the seat, fuel tank and footpegs at different points in the rev range. Thankfully, it is no longer as harsh as it was when it was first launched in 2023.  You can read our previous road test to get an understanding of the performance on offer here, and the RTR punches above its weight, even out-accelerating more powerful rivals like the Triumph Speed 400. A beautifully smooth bi-directional quickshifter only adds to the experience.  Engine2025 TVS Apache RTR 310Engine312.12 cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooledOutput35.6hp at 9,700rpmTorque28.7Nm at 6,650rpmGearbox6-speed   TVS Apache RTR 310 Suspension Comfort, Handling and Brakes - 8/10 No changes to the way the bike handles The new RTR 310 carries the same chassis, suspension, brakes and tyres, and it also weighs the same 169kg, so there’s no surprise that it continues to ride as before. The seating position is well-judged for the road, with a mildly sporty lean down to the wide handlebar but good comfort in the footpeg placement. The 800mm seat height is friendly for short riders, and even tall folks will fit well on this bike. Things are a little different on track because there’s not a lot of room to slide back and tuck down. This is both thanks to the big pillion seat bump-stop and the large TFT that you’ll find right in front of your helmet when crouched down. Despite these compromises, on-track handling is really very good, and the bike feels light, agile and quick-turning but also comfortingly stable.  Our test bikes had the optional adjustable suspension, which most riders won’t need on the road, but it can be a good benefit on track. Another small improvement I noticed was that while this RTR’s traction control used to be unnecessarily intrusive (even in Track mode), that’s no longer the case, and I didn’t find the need to turn it off.  The Michelin Road 5 tyres provide a surprisingly sharp and fast transition in how the bike leans over to its side, but there’s superb grip once you’re there. The brakes feel the same as well, in that they have a slightly dull initial bite but good power once you put some effort into the lever.  The Michelin Road 5 tyres offer superb grip. However, as before, the RTR’s on-track limit arrives a little too early thanks to the footpegs scraping the tarmac. This was improved to some extent by removing the feeler bolts, but it didn’t solve the problem. Adding more suspension preload would have helped increase the cornering clearance, but it wasn’t something we had time to try at this event.  At the end of the day, the TVS RTR 310 is a very encouraging bike on track, and I wanted to keep reeling in the laps, but it’s not designed to particularly excel there. For those who want a sporty street naked that they clearly intend to take to the racetrack, the KTM 390 Duke will be the more rewarding choice. And on that note, it’s time to move to the price. Key specs2025 TVS Apache RTR 310Kerb weight169kgSeat height800mmFuel capacity11 litresGround clearance180mmWheelbase1358mm TVS Apache RTR 310 Price and Verdict - 8/10 More kit and features for a lower price than before  The good news is that TVS is offering introductory prices that are Rs 10,000 less than they were before. However, the RTR’s pricing is a rather confusing topic because it places the bike in two different lights. This bi-directional quickshifter adds to the overall experience. On the one hand, the base bike at Rs 2.4 lakh ex-showroom Delhi is a fantastic value because it offers much stronger performance than the likes of the KTM 250 Duke and still has valuable features like the Michelin Road 5 tyres, 5-inch TFT, traction control and cruise control. Our pick would be to pay the extra Rs 13,000 for the bi-directional quickshifter because it really does enhance the experience. Above that, you have the choice of adding the BTO Dynamic kit, which adds adjustable suspension, tyre pressure monitoring and a brass-coated chain. This takes the price to Rs 2.75 lakh. Instead of the Dynamic kit, you can add the Dynamic Pro kit, which introduces keyless start and a huge array of electronic rider aids that include cornering ABS, cornering traction control, anti-wheelie, anti-stoppie, and a whole lot more. This will increase the sticker price to Rs 2.85 lakh. If you add both the kits, the price goes to Rs 3.03 lakh. On top of this, the Fiery Red colour will set you back by a further Rs 5,000, while the Sepang Blue costs a massive Rs 15,000. At this point, the RTR 310 costs significantly more than a KTM 390 Duke, and while we salute TVS’ efforts towards introducing segment-leading technologies, they’re not essential with this performance level, and they push the price into the realm of unreasonableness. Opting for the fully loaded variant with BTO packs can push the price well beyond Rs 3 lakh. To sum up, then, the RTR 310 is either a surprisingly good value motorcycle that punches above its weight or an excessively expensive motorcycle that is completely out of its depth. It all depends on which variant you choose.   PriceVariantColourPriceBase without QuickShifterBlackRs 2.40 lakh TopBlack, Red and YellowRs 2.57 lakhDynamic KItBlack, Yellow, Red and BlueRs 2.75 lakhDynamic Pro KitBlack, Yellow, Red and BlueRs 2.85 lakhDynamic + Dynamic Pro KitsBlack, Yellow, Red and BlueRs 3.03 lakh Also see: 2025 TVS Apache RTR 310 video review",

    "description": "What we have here is Kia’s first mass market EV for India. Lo and behold, it's not an SUV/crossover. It’s called the Kia Carens Clavis EV and the name spells out what it is – an all-electric version of the Clavis. The experience, as you’ll learn, is familiar yet different. Kia Carens Clavis EV exterior design and engineering - 8/10 Subtle tweaks help distinguish Clavis EV from its ICE sibling. A green number plate will be the biggest indicator that the Carens Clavis you are looking at is indeed the EV version. Kia hasn’t tinkered with the MPV’s design in any way but there are some EV-specific style tweaks. Kia hasn't tinkered much with the MPV's design on this EV version. The light bar above the grille glows (it doesn’t on petrol/diesel versions), the charging flap sits at the centre of the nose, while the revised bumper is home to active aero elements (they open/close as needed), ‘ice cube’-look fog lamps and a redone scuff plate. The EV’s bonnet also lifts to reveal a 25-litre frunk, which can be used to stow charging cables. An aero-optimised look for the 17-inch wheels is also unique to the Clavis EV while the changes at the back are limited to the new EV badging. 17-inch alloys get a new aero-optimised design. Under the skin, the Kia Carens Clavis EV has much in common with the Hyundai Creta Electric. Like the Creta Electric, the Clavis EV positions its battery pack in the wheelbase. On offer are 42kWh and 51.4kWh battery pack versions, with the former paired with a 135hp/255Nm motor and the latter a more powerful 171hp/255Nm unit; both are front-mounted and front wheel-drive. Kia Carens Clavis EV interior space and comfort - 8/10 Well packaged battery means no compromise in space or seating comfort. If you’ve been in a Clavis, you’ll be at home in a Clavis EV. The basic look inside is shared with a smartly finished dash sporting a twin-screen arrangement. The EV does distinguish itself with a floating look for the console between the front seats. The console serves as an armrest, packs in cupholders and is also home to buttons for features like seat ventilation. There’s open storage below it, and in general, the cabin has an airy feel. Interior remains largely unchanged from Clavis except for a new floating centre console design. Getting in and out of the Clavis EV is easy and drivers will like their seat for comfort and adjustability – the seats get partial power adjust while the steering adjusts for rake and reach. The steering itself is nice to hold with nice paddles and a chunky drive mode selector button.  What’s nice is how well the battery pack has been accommodated in the body. The middle row seating position doesn’t feel too different to the ICE versions’, so you don’t get that knees-up position we’ve come to expect in EVs that position their battery pack under the floor. The middle row is comfy and scores really well on flexibility. The middle row is comfy and scores really well on flexibility. The seats split 60:40, can be slid back and forth and also get generous backrest recline. There’s also a powered adjust to move the front passenger seat forward to free up more room for the boss seat. Do note, the Clavis EV is only offered in 7-seat form and doesn’t get the option of captain’s chairs for the middle row. Getting to the third row is an easy affair thanks to a one-touch powered seat fold function that opens up a large walk through. The rearmost seats are suitable for average-sized adults and it's easy to work out a space compromise with the middle seat passengers. Third row seats are adequate for two average-sized adults. With all seats up, there’s space for a few soft bags in the boot. The third and second rows can be folded flat to create more luggage room as required. Kia Carens Clavis EV performance and refinement - 8/10 Performance is brisk and there’s ample pulling power even when loaded. Kia Carens Clavis EV specsStandard Extended Range Battery 42kWh 51.4kWh Drive layout Front, single motor Front, single motor Power 135hp 171hp Torque 255Nm 255Nm Featured here is the Clavis EV in its larger battery and more powerful Extended Range guise. Like other EVs, the experience in the cabin is quiet. There is little you hear of the motor up front and even road and wind noise are well contained. Even at part throttle, the Clavis EV has a nice reserve of power. MPVs aren’t typically about performance so you’ll be pleasantly surprised by the Clavis EV’s build of speed. Kia claims an 8.4-second 0-100kph time, which is suitably brisk. There’s a strong pull should you press down on the accelerator and this, for instance, makes overtaking very easy. There’s ready power even at part throttle and you’ll rarely, if ever, need to dial up to Sport mode. The default Normal setting works just fine and even Eco is more than sufficient for everyday commutes. There’s enough poke even with all three rows occupied and even the climb up to Nandi Hills was easy going for the Clavis EV. Kia Carens Clavis EV efficiency/range - 7/10 Carens Clavis EV has an official range of up to 490km. Kia Carens Clavis EV range and chargingStandard Extended Range Battery 42kWh 51.4kWh Claimed range (ARAI)404km 490km 11kW AC charging (10-100%)4 hours 4 hours 45 mins DC charging (10-100%)39mins39mins The Carens Clavis EV with the 42kWh battery pack has an official range of 404km while the larger 51.4kWh battery pack boasts a 490km official range figure. Over our test drive, the Clavis EV Extended Range delivered a real-world figure in the region of 320-350km (depending on mode). The caveat here is that our drive route included a run up to Nandi Hills, and inclines really sap battery charge. We’ll wait to test the Clavis EV in Mumbai on our efficiency test loop before delivering final judgement on how far it can go on a full charge. Extended Range variant has an ARAI-certified range of 490km. The Clavis EV supports DC charging at up to 100kW that enables a 10-80 percent charge in 39 minutes. Worth highlighting is that Kia is establishing a network of these fast chargers at its dealerships for times when you need a quick top up charge. Ultimately, it’s the spread of high-speed chargers pan India that will determine how far and freely you can travel with a Carens EV. For the majority of owners, a 11kW AC charger (supplied with the car) set up at home or your work place will be the go to solution to juice up the Clavis EV’s battery pack. A 10-100 percent charge takes 4 hours for the 42kWh version and 4 hours and 45 minutes for the 51.4kWh version. Kia Carens Clavis EV ride comfort and handling - 7/10 Easy-to-drive demeanour complemented by pleasant ride comfort. We’ve always liked the Carens (and now Clavis) for its friendly manners and that’s no different on the Clavis EV. For one, the Clavis EV doesn’t intimidate anyone upgrading from a smaller vehicle. The light steering, great visibility and the crisp cameras help to this end.  There's a slight hint of firmness, but ride comfort is good overall.  Kia has retuned the suspension to deal with the added weight of the battery pack, and it’s a job well done. Ride comfort is good for the most part, and it's only when getting off sharp speedbreakers that you’ll notice the Clavis EV slam down on its springs before settling quickly. You’ll feel a hint of firmness if you really pay attention to the happenings beneath. The Clavis EV offers 200mm of unladen ground clearance and the body or battery pack didn't make contact with the ground even over broken patches. At higher speeds, the Clavis EV feels composed and surefooted. Despite the battery pack sticking out, it didn't make any contact with the ground on our drive. Braking performance is also good with reassuring stopping power. Regen braking that uses the motor to slow the vehicle down, and feed some of the recovered energy back to the battery, is part of the package. Regen strength can be toggled via paddleshifters and there are four settings: off, mild, mid and strong. You get one-pedal driving (ability to bring the car to a halt using regen) in the strongest setting, though the drop in speed towards the end could be more urgent. What’s nice is how well the regen works with ADAS functions like adaptive cruise control to modulate speed.  Kia Carens Clavis EV price and verdict - 8/10 Pricey at the top end but an EV that fits the bill for large families. The Clavis EV is a very likeable product offering. It has all that we like about the Clavis and all that we like about EVs in one competent package. High mileage users (as many MPV owners tend to be), in particular, will be tempted by the move to electric given the savings in running costs. There is a price to pay, though, and that is in upfront costs. The Clavis EV is the only three-row EV in the Rs 20 lakh-25 lakh price range. Kia has launched the Clavis EV at Rs 17.99 lakh with the range-topping version featured here priced at Rs 24.49 lakh (ex-showroom). That’s Rs 3 lakh over a similarly equipped Carens Clavis turbo-petrol with a DCT. Incentives and registration benefits on EVs do reduce the on-road price delta, at least for the moment. Thing is, there’s no other 7-seat EV at this price point. The only other 3-row EV is BYD’s eMax 7 that costs a few lakhs more. The Clavis, then, is actually an alternative to the increasing number of electric SUV options in the Rs 20 lakh-25 lakh band. For anyone keen on an EV and with regular use for three rows, the Clavis EV is really the only choice. And a very good one indeed.

    "description": "Mokka Electric gets nearly twice as much power as standard, plus a limited-slip 'diff Vauxhall has reimagined its GSe performance brand with a new version of the Mokka Electric that has nearly double the power of the standard car. Previewed by the Mokka GSe Rally prototype in May, the crossover’s arrival marks the relaunch of GSe, most recently used for the plug-in hybrid Astra GSe, as a badge for performance-honed fully electric cars. The Mokka is also a more serious proposition than the Astra, with substantially more power and extensive chassis modifications. Its new motor, which is shared with the Abarth 600e, the Alfa Romeo Junior Elettrica Veloce and the new Peugeot e-208 GTi, puts out 276bhp and 254lb ft. That’s sent to the front wheels through a Torsen limitedslip differential, and it allows the Mokka GSe to hit 62mph from rest in 5.9sec. To cope with that significant uptick in performance, the GSe’s rear axle has been redesigned to add an anti-roll bar and tauter bushings. Together, these are said to increase the back end’s torsional stiffness by 189% compared with the regular car. The GSe also gets more heavily weighted steering, 380mm Alcon front brake discs with four-pot calipers and new dampers with hydraulic bump stops. The Mokka GSe rides on new 20in alloy wheels shod with Michelin Pilot Sport EV tyres, and it tips the scales at less than 1600kg. The brand has yet to disclose a range, but the e-208 GTi, 600e and Junior Elettrica Veloce all return around 200 miles between charges. For reference, the standard Mokka EV has a 247-mile claimed range from the same 54kWh battery used by the GSe. Visually, the new model is marked out by its neon yellow contrasting elements and new gloss black panels on its front and rear bumpers. Inside, it has Alcantara bucket seats and door cards, and the infotainment touchscreen features new displays including a g-force meter. Prices and delivery dates have yet to be confirmed, but a 600e with the 276bhp motor starts from £39,885, while the Junior Elettrica Veloce is £42,305. That suggests the Vauxhall could land in the high-£30,000s – possibly just undercutting the UK’s £40,000 luxury car tax threshold.",

The foundational structure, Aston’s chief engineer Simon Newton, reassures me, is basically the same between the regular Aston Martin Vanquish and the Volante. The interior, too, is the same as the regular car, and it continues with that car’s raison d’être. This is a two-tonne bruiser of a super GT-cum-supercar. A 5.2-litre V12-engined £360,000 2.0-metre wide screaming flare that signals “I am doing very well for myself”.",

    "description": "Niche as it is, the performance bagger scene is having its moment in the spotlight—thanks largely to the wildly entertaining King of the Baggers racing series. Baggers are fast evolving from grandad tourers into adrenaline-fueled machines with miles of attitude. The whole concept is slightly unhinged, but we’re here for it. Indian Motorcycle’s latest custom build initiative is a full-throttle tribute to performance bagger culture. As part of the American marque’s ‘Forged’ series, three Indian Chieftain PowerPlus tourers were handed to custom builders to do with as they pleased. The menacing example you’re looking at here was built by the V-twin specialist shop and parts maker Kraus Motor Co. It’s no fluke that Kraus Motor Co. ended up on the Forged roster.…",

The safety goggles sit folded next to the electric tape atop a bright red tool cabinet, the tools tucked quietly inside. There’s a shelf for paint, a desk for business, and a work bench divides the room into halves, a side for each brother. But this isn’t the pretty face of some bought-and-paid-for shop. “Our mom and I are both neat freaks,” Justin tells me. “I might have a disorder. I don’t think I can function amongst clutter.” Then they describe ironing their shirts to go bag groceries as teenagers.…",

    "description": "The 2025 MRF MMSC Indian National Car Racing Championship kicked off at Coimbatore’s Kari Motor Speedway on July 18-20. Multiple-time national champion Arjun Balu returns to the championship after a year away and is already back to his winning ways. Arjun Chheda, Bhuvan Bonu and Aman Nagdev were some of the other star racers who picked up wins at the opening round. MRF F2000 Sixteen-year-old Arjun Chheda made the best of a poor start by polesitter Ishaan Madesh to win the opening race with a sizeable lead. Madesh stalled his car at the start but recovered to finish second.  Both drivers led the way on Sunday as well, with Madesh winning Race 2 and Chheda winning Race 3. Having won two out of three races, Chheda moves to the top of the standings.   MRF F2000 Race 1 results 1. Arjun Chheda - 13mins 28.502sec 2. Ishaan Madesh – 13mins 37.603sec 3. Shivesh Selvarathnam – 13mins 41.796sec MRF F2000 Race 2 results 1. Ishaan Madesh - 15mins 41.539sec 2. Arjun Chheda – 15mins 43.950sec 3. Akhil Agarwal – 15mins 52.431sec MRF F2000 Race 3 results 1.

Akhil Agarwal – 13mins 39.242sec MRF F1600 The MRF Formula 1600 class saw plenty of wheel-to-wheel racing and three different race winners. Sai Shiva Sankaran recovered from a poor start to win Race 1, his first-ever victory in this class. Two Bengalureans, Nigel Abraham Thomas and Arjun Nair, won a race each on Sunday.  Both Sankaran and Thomas also finished on the podium in all three races.  MRF F1600 Race 1 results 1. Sai Shiva Makesh Sankaran – 14mins 24.471sec 2. Arjun S Nair – 14mins 24.902sec 3. Nigel Abraham Thomas – 14mins 40.437sec MRF F1600 Race 2 results 1. Nigel Abraham Thomas – 16mins 52.562sec 2.

Nigel Abraham Thomas – 14mins 22.159sec Indian Touring Cars Veteran racer and multiple-time national champion Ajun Balu returned to the Indian Touring Cars (ITC) class after a year’s break. Driving a Race Concepts-prepared Honda City i-VTEC, Balu kicked off his 2025 campaign on a strong note and won two out of three races.  Misfortune struck Balu when his City started misfiring while he was leading Race 3, forcing him to slow down. Despite nursing a turbo issue on his Volkswagen Polo, Biren Pithawalla made the most of the situation and zipped past Balu to win Race 3.  Multiple-time national champion Arjun Balu won two out of three ITC races. Indian Touring Cars Race 1 results 1. Arjun Balu (Race Concepts) – 15mins 24.662sec 2. Dhruv Chavan (Privateer) – 16mins 04.961sec 3.

Dhruv Chavan (Buzzing Hornet) – 15mins 32.586sec Indian Touring Cars 1625 This year’s championship sees the addition of a new ITC category for cars up to 1,625cc. Only two racers competed in this new category - the championship’s oldest driver, Vidyaprakash Damodaran (who turns 80 this August), and local ace Suprej Venkat. Remarkably, after retiring from Race 1, Damodaran bounced back the next day and defeated Venkat in Race 3. “The highlight was the race I didn’t win,” Venkat shared on his social media.  “[I] came second to none other than D. Vidyaprakash uncle – my tuner, mentor and racing guru. He’s 80, still races like a beast, and gave me one of the cleanest, hardest fights I’ve had on track. It was an honour to chase him to the finish line, and honestly, that second place meant more to me than both wins.” 79-year-old Vidyaprakash Damodaran (right) won Race 3.

The three of them classified in the same positions in the Junior class as well. Fifteen-year-old Bhuvan Bonu emerged as the star driver on Sunday, winning Race 2 in both the Open and Junior classes. He was leading Race 3 as well before the rains forced its cancellation. Formula LGB 1300 Race 1 results 1. Joel Joseph (DTS Racing) – 15mins 16.951sec 2.

    "description": "Ultraviolette has rolled out a performance update for its flagship F77 electric motorcycle. Dubbed the Gen3 Powertrain Firmware, the update brings sharper performance via what Ultraviolette calls Ballistic+, which is available to all existing F77 customers at no extra cost. Ultraviolette F77 gets more torque response Developed using insights from over 8 million km of real-world ride data Available to all F77 customers for free, with no change in peak output Ultraviolette F77 gets Gen 3 firmware update It continues to produce the same 40hp and 100Nm Ultraviolette states that these learnings have been gained after the bikes went on sale in Europe, where average speeds are much higher and thereby put more demands on the system. To counter this, the company worked on pushing the thermal limits on its motor and motor controller to not only extend the duration before performance deration kicks in but also offer more initial torque surge.  While Ultraviolette refers to the update as Ballistic+, the name of the top mode shown on the bike’s TFT display will continue to read ‘Ballistic’. The company claims this update is designed to deliver a noticeably sharper and more engaging riding experience, with quicker throttle response and a stronger initial power surge. However, peak output of 40hp and 100Nm remains unchanged, with the software doing all the heavy lifting. Battery capacity is also unchanged at 7.1kWh for the Mach 2 and 10.3kWh for the Mach 2 Recon, and the company claims no change to the range figures either.  Ultraviolette F77 Gen3 firmware backward compatibility This update is backward compatible with all existing F77 variants The F77’s Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) processes over 3,000 data points in real time. This data, interpreted by the bike’s software systems, helps fine-tune the drivetrain, motor controller and battery-management system. According to Ultraviolette, this has enabled the F77 to extract more performance purely through software optimisation. The update is backwards-compatible across all F77 variants and will be rolled out to all existing customers at no additional cost.
