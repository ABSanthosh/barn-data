    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/lotus-plans-close-uk-plant-norfolk-and-shift-production-us",
    "description": "Firm could end production at Norfolk factory after 59 years and start building cars in US Lotus UK has been told it needs to prepare for the end of production at Hethel as the Geely-owned company pivots production towards the US. The order to stop has come from Lotus management in China,  a source told Autocar.  Lotus didn’t provide a comment, but did confirm that production of the Emira sports car, the plant’s chief model, has been paused since mid-May as it managed the fallout from the increase in tariffs in its key market of the US. Lotus wants instead to build cars in the US., eradicating tariff barriers. “We believe that localization is a feasible plan,” Lotus CEO Feng Qingfeng said on his company’s first quarter earnings call June 25. “We are trying to leverage our US strategy to catch up the losses due to the tariff hike.”  Feng said that the company had an “in-depth discussion with our strategic partners” to build in the US, without mentioning names. The strongest possibility is that Lotus moves some production, including possibly the Emira to Volvo’s under-utilised plant in South Carolina. Volvo is also owned by Geely. Lotus has scrambled to reduce costs amid persistent losses. The company in April laid off 270 workers at Hethel and is Autocar understands its Clerkenwell headquarters is set to close having only been opened a few months ago at huge expense. The brand’s flagship store on Park Lane has been transferred to dealer group HR Owen, understood to also be part of a cost cutting move. Lotus sales fell 42% in the first quarter of the year, marking the first significant decline since Geely rolled out a new range of electric ‘lifestyle’ vehicles including the Eletre SUV and Emeya sedan. Geely bought the brand in 2017 from Malaysia’s DRB-Hitcom, which also owns Proton, but has yet to see a return on the its £2 billion investment. Lotus posted a net loss of $183 million the first quarter while debts increased to $3.3 billion. The company has been hit by muted demand for cars at the top end of the electric segment. “In recent years, premium brand BEV penetration does not meet our expectation,” Feng said on the call.  The US was to be a big market for the new electric cars but the country’s imposition of 100% tariffs on China-built EVs forced Lotus to stop selling the Eletre there. Demand has also fallen in Europe and China, with deliveries of the Eletre and Emeya down 31% to 719 in the first three months. The company will pivot instead to Hyper Hybrid PHEVs with Lotus sports cars also in-line for an electrified drivetrain. The first Lotus plug-in hybrid will be the Eletre and will go on sale in the first quarter of next year, starting in China. Hethel was to build a planned electric sports car when Emira production ended but lack of enthusiasm in the market forced Lotus to postpone to the car indefinitely. “Is the market ready for an electric sports car? I don't really know the answer to that yet,” Lotus Europe CEO Windle told Autocar in May. Windle had been pushing Geely to build more models in the Hethel plant, which assembled around 5000 Emiras last year but has a theoretical capacity for 10,000. One potential model was the specialist Polestar 6 electric roadster. “I think we could build it,” Windle said. “There's an element of transition because at the moment it's just ICE, but we're going to have to go on that journey.” Geely might have judged that Hethel wasn’t worth investing in further given that legislation would force the end of combustion engine cars, with the less climate-friendly US emerging as the last major combustion engine market on the planet. Lotus CEO Feng has previously said that the company is assessing a V8 option for the Emira. Lotus’s reset has come after the company dramatically over-estimated its growth. Ahead of its listing in New York in 2024, the company predicted it would be building 150,000 cars year by 2028, most from a new factory in Wuhan, China. A midsize SUV aimed at the Porsche Macan and codenamed Type 134 would deliver the bulk of sales when it launched in 2027. However the Type 134 was put on hold amid the EV slowdown and Lotus has struggled to build the momentum it needs to pay for the investment. Deliveries last year reached 12,134. Closing Hethel would be a massive blow for the government, which earlier this week laid out its industrial strategy to help grow vehicle production to 1.3 million by 2035, up from 905,233 last year. Lotus production is small compared to bigger players like JLR but the brand has survived in its Norfolk home since 1966, when Lotus founder Colin Chapman bought the former airfield from the government. Geely invested £100 million in the site, including a new sports car manufacturing facility that opened in 2022 to build the Emira.  One former senior Lotus executive called plans for closure “a disgrace”.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-goodwood-festival-of-speed/goodwood-festival-speed-2025-preview-all-biggest",
    "description": "Aston Martin, Hyundai and MG are among the brands making a splash at this year's Festival of Speed The Goodwood Festival of Speed (10-13 July) is just weeks away and it's shaping up to be one of the highlights of the motoring year. It will host big reveals from Lanzante, Hyundai, MG and plenty more besides, as well as an array of debuts from Aston Martin, BMW and Honda. Below is our guide to the most important cars at this year's Festival of Speed. Aston Martin DBX S This new performance-focused version of Aston’s luxury SUV outpunches the Ferrari Purosangue, putting out a substantial 717bhp. You'll be able to see it in the First Glance paddock at Goodwood. Everything you need to know about the Aston Martin DBX S Aston Martin Valhalla The Festival of Speed will be your first chance to catch Aston Martin’s new 1064bhp hypercar rolling on home turf. Production of the Valhalla is scheduled to begin imminently. Everything you need to know about the Aston Martin Valhalla BMW M2 CS BMW’s junior sports car gets the Competition Sport treatment, gaining 50bhp more than the regular M2 and packing a generous 479lb ft. An abundance of carbonfibre also helps to reduce its kerb weight to 1700kg and it dispatches 0-62mph in just 3.8sec. Goodwood will mark the first time it’s been displayed to the public in the UK. Customer deliveries will start at the end of the summer. Everything you need to know about the BMW M2 CS BMW Concept Speedtop Last year’s striking Skytop convertible has been transformed into a svelte shooting brake for a lucky handful of BMW loyalists. It has been conceived as an “intentional counterpoint to our current models”, according to BMW Group design chief Adrian van Hooydonk, and is set to make limited production. This may be your only chance to catch one in the metal before they disappear into collections. Everything you need to know about the BMW Concept Speedtop BMW Vision Driving Experience Four motors, five downforce-producing fans and 13,269lb ft of torque: the Vision Driving Experience is BMW’s manifesto for driving enjoyment in the electric age. The firm's performance machines will still be rear-biased, for example, and they will use control electronics that can respond 10 times more quickly than those fitted to previous-generation M cars. This car will make its first UK appearance at the Festival of Speed. Everything you need to know about the BMW Vision Driving Experience Eccentrica Diablo restomod Described by its maker as the ultimate Diablo, this restomod intends to unleash the potential of Lamborghini’s famously tetchy flagship. Its chassis has been reinforced with carbonfibre, the brakes overhauled, traction control added and the V12 tweaked with new camshafts and springs. It has also received a redesign, with ‘pop-down’ headlights, flared wings and exposed exhaust pipes. It will take to the Goodwood hillclimb, marking the first time it will have been seen in action. GMA T33 Gordon Murray previously used the Goodwood Members’ Meeting to unveil the T33, but now is the general public’s chance to see it in the metal. Priced from £1.37 million and positioned as a more practical foil to the T50, it too packs a naturally aspirated V12, here kicking out 607bhp and revving out to 11,100rpm. Just 100 will be built, although there will be spin-off models, such as a Spider and a more aggressive, track-focused S variant. Everything you need to know about the GMA T33 GMA T33 Spider Weighing just 18kg more than its coupé counterpart, the T33 Spider promises a more visceral experience, thanks to its Targa-style roof and air intake scoop positioned just proud of the roll bar. It will be on display to the general public for the first time at this year’s Festival of Speed. Everything you need to know about the GMA T33 Spider Honda 0 Series SUV This blocky MPV-like SUV serves as our first look at Honda’s rebirth for the electric age. Named the 0 Series to represent the brand starting afresh, it ushers in a dramatic new look and promises major developments in both efficiency and practicality. The Festival of Speed will mark its first appearance in Europe. Everything you need to know about the Honda 0 Series SUV Honda Civic Type R Ultimate One of our favourite hot hatches is about to bow out, but not before receiving a special-edition variant commemorating its 28-year production run. It’s painted in the Type R’s signature Championship White shade, with contrasting red racing stripes recalling its trademark interior colour. Only 40 will be built, of which a quarter are bound for the UK. Goodwood may just be your best chance to see one before they’re all gone. Everything you need to know about the Honda Civic Type R Ultimate Honda Prelude Honda’s sporting coupé returns with Civic underpinnings, a 181bhp hybrid powertrain and even a simulated sequential gearbox. The production car isn’t due until later this year, but Goodwood will be the first chance to spot it on the move, as it takes to the hillclimb. Everything you need to know about the Honda Prelude Honda Super EV Concept Honda will unveil its vision of a small, fun-to-drive EV at the Festival of Speed. Named the Super EV Concept, it previews a rival for the Hyundai Inster and Fiat 500e, and has already been tested in the UK.  Everything you need to know about the Honda Super EV Concept Hyundai Ioniq 6 N Hyundai will at last reveal the hot Ioniq 6 N at this year’s Festival of Speed, having hinted at the model since it unveiled the RN22e concept car three years ago. The car will bring major styling tweaks such as a huge rear spoiler, wider arches and a more aggressive-looking front fascia and it is likely to use the same 641bhp powertrain as the existing Ioniq 5 N. Everything you need to know about the Hyundai Ioniq 6 N Land Rover Defender Trophy Edition This special-edition Defender harks back to Land Rover’s Camel Trophy 4x4s, with chunky steelie-style wheels, a choice of Sandy Yellow or Forest Green paintwork and even the option of an intake snorkel. It will be seen in public for the first time at Goodwood. Everything you need to know about the Land Rover Defender Trophy Edition Lanzante 95-59 Petersfield-based hypercar specialist Lanzante will reveal its first bespoke model at the Festival of Speed. Based on an existing McLaren platform and penned by former McLaren designer Paul Howse, it will pack 700bhp per tonne and a McLaren F1-style three-seat cockpit. Everything you need to know about the Lanzante 95-59 MG Cyberster Black This special-edition roadster matches deep-black paintwork with chrome accents. Read our MG Cyberster review MG CyberX A boxy 4x4, this radical concept car hints at MG’s plans to expand into new segments and punch upmarket. The Festival of Speed will host its European debut and could bring more news about any plans to build the model. Everything we know about the MG CyberX MG/IM IM6 MG will reveal a new model at Goodwood and it looks to be one of several models from Audi-rivalling sibling brand IM. Their arrival in the UK would mark a shift in MG’s strategy, boldly taking the brand into new segments and away from its previous budget-focused positioning. Everything we know about the MG/IM reveal Praga Bohema This track-focused but road-legal supercar will take to the Goodwood hillclimb in a bid to topple some of the world’s biggest marques. Packing 700bhp and weighing just 982kg, it’s in with a fair chance. Everything we know about the Praga Bohema Toyota GR reveal  Toyota’s GR performance division is gearing up for a big reveal at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in July. Speaking to Autocar recently, Toyota Europe vice-president Andrea Carlucci said “the UK is the most amazing country in terms of pure car lovers, even more than other countries” and he is “attached to Goodwood”. He added: “This year, you will see something – let’s put it like that.” Carlucci declined to disclose further details but said: “We have to bring [many] more cars as GR models to the marketplace and I hope the UK will bring as many as [it] wants.”",

    "description": "Harley-Davidson’s core business is, and will always be, big American V-twins. But there are moments in The Motor Co.’s history where it has deviated from this formula in a bid to attract a wider audience, with varying levels of success. In the 60s and 70s, Harley leveraged their part (and later full) ownership of the Italian manufacturer Aermacchi to create a handful of smaller bikes—like the 1974 Harley-Davidson SX250. Released during Harley’s infamous AMF era, this single-cylinder two-stroke was designed to compete with the lightweight Japanese enduro bikes of the day. But since it was effectively just a rebadged Aermacchi, it faded from existence when Harley sold the Italian firm to Cagiva in 1978. These days, Aermacchi Harleys enjoy a niche following among vintage racers, and anyone else who has a soft spot for 1970s oddballs.…",

    "description": "Motorcycle tech has evolved exponentially over the past two decades—making today’s bikes easier to ride, but harder to customize. Complex wiring harnesses are a nightmare to navigate, and CAN bus systems limit what you can unplug without risking a bricked ECU. Luckily, the 2006 Triumph Scrambler sidesteps these modern afflictions. Triumph’s current crop of modern classics are liquid-cooled, ride-by-wire machines with rider aids and TFT screens. The older Triumph Scrambler is delightfully simple by comparison. You get a torquey, air-cooled parallel-twin, fed by twin carbs… and not much else. That makes it a fantastic base for stylish custom builds—like this Triumph Scrambler from Taiwan’s 2LOUD Custom. Known for blending eclectic flair with refined craftsmanship, 2LOUD’s approach suits the Scrambler perfectly.…",

    "description": "In a fiercely competitive segment, the Raida Carbonite gloves promise a blend of robust protection and everyday comfort. But having put them through their paces on Mumbai’s chaotic roads, allow me to delve into whether they live up to the promise. Straight out of the box, the quality of the stitching and materials is impressive for the price. The full-grain leather feels substantial, and the carbon-fibre knuckle protectors, alongside the rubberised plastic scaphoid shield, inspire a good degree of confidence.  The gloves feature pre-curved fingers and a neoprene wrist cuff, which contribute to a generally pleasant feel. Ventilation is adequate, with mesh panels on the thumb, index and middle fingers, and vented TPR protectors on the leather ring and pinky fingers. However, in Mumbai’s humid climate, you’ll inevitably feel sweat building on your palms, especially during prolonged stops.  A significant point of contention here is the fit. I consulted the online size chart and opted for the large size. However, I noted empty voids on top of the ring and pinky fingers. This slightly loose fit at the fingertips can reduce feel but won’t pose a risk while riding. I also experienced a distinct tugging sensation on the thumb during initial rides. While this improved as the gloves broke in over time, it still persists, albeit to a lesser degree.  Fit can be an issue, so it’s best to try them before buying. Finally, the touch-compatible fingertips are a feature many riders look for today. My experience, however, aligns with a known issue across many gloves. While they technically work, precise inputs are difficult. Don’t expect to compose messages or navigate intricate menus; they’re best for quick taps to answer calls or skip tracks. Despite the minor fit nuances and the expected heat build-up, the Raida Carbonite gloves offer a solid package of protection and decent comfort for the price. They are a good VFM option for urban commuters and occasional tourers, provided you find a size that fits your hands well.

    "description": "Explosive performance at an accessible price – these words instantly bring a certain orange machine to mind. Since 2013, the KTM 390 Duke has dominated its class, and every single rival that has gone up against the Duke has retreated with its tail tucked between its legs. But today, the Duke will have to deal with its toughest challenge yet posed by the Aprilia Tuono 457. KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 design and ergonomics Both have sharp designs and can feel tight for taller folks With some bikes, just a glance is enough to tell you what they are meant to do, and the designs of these two machines are true to their function. Neither is classically good-looking, and both are aggressively styled, although in its latest avatar, the 390 might be too aggressive for some.  The rider’s triangle is the first difference you’ll notice, and while both are reasonably comfortable, on the Aprilia, there is a bit of a forward reach to the handlebar, whereas you’re almost bolt upright on the KTM. Over bad roads, this will be felt in the lower back. With their 800mm perches, these bikes will be welcoming for shorter riders but feel cramped for taller ones.  Both bikes are a little tight for larger and heavier riders. At 5’11”, I just about fit on both these machines, but taller riders should look elsewhere. The Duke can be had with an accessory tall seat, raising its perch to 820mm, which will liberate some knee room for taller riders. The optional comfort seat on the Tuono keeps the same height as the stock unit. Neither is geared toward all-out comfort, and that’s par for the course.  KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 quality and features Duke has larger number of useful features and better quality all across Modern-day KTMs have made huge strides when it comes to the quality front, and that is clearly visible here. The Tuono 457, with its aluminium chassis, looks great, but crucial areas, such as the cheap-feeling key, the more basic levers and an ugly misaligned panel on the headlight surround, just feel like a step down from the KTM. Fun fact: the adjustable brake lever on the Tuono is a Rs 5,500 accessory (!) and appears to be the exact same unit as the one on the Gen 2 390 Duke that sells for under Rs 1,000. The 390 Duke now also gets cruise control. Another facet where the Duke is ahead of the Tuono is the features (and bragging rights) department. Its suspension has damping adjustability, the bidirectional quickshifter is standard, it comes with a cornering anti-lock braking system (ABS) and traction control (TC), and the latest model even has cruise control. The Tuono, with its three riding modes, switchable ABS and TC and preload-adjustable front suspension, has a good level of kit, unlike the contender from the tuning fork brand. As for the Aprilia’s bidirectional quickshifter? A cool Rs 20,000 for that.  KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 handling Both are superb handlers and will put a big smile on your face However, you don’t ride a bike’s build quality or features, so I’ll stop rambling about that and start raving about how these things behave on the road. Both take very different approaches to their chassis – the KTM uses a steel trellis, while the Aprilia has an aluminium perimeter frame (the only one in this class to do so). Predictably, their behaviour on the side of the tyre is markedly different, but both are almost equally fast in the real world.  Both machines are fast, but they go about their business quite differently. It might sound cliché, but the Duke feels a lot like a supermoto, and the Tuono feels a lot like a sportbike with a taller handlebar in the corners. They handle with a different feeling: the Duke prioritises lightness and reactivity, while the Aprilia feels agile but also beautifully composed. That said, both handle very well, and you’ll have a great time on either machine, whether on road or track.  Key specificationsAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukeKerb Weight175kg168.3kgSeat height800mm800mmGround clearance 150mm170mmFuel tank capacity12.7 litres15 litresWheelbase1360mm1357mm KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 ride comfort Duke's suspension more pliant; Tuono's brake fade issue an annoyance While chasing twisty ribbons of tarmac is what owners will dream of doing with these bikes, the reality is they will be used for commuting more often. Mumbai’s lumpy roads are a proper test of a bike’s suspension, and here, the Duke’s sophisticated setup will be worth its weight in gold. The bike feels a lot more absorptive while going over bumps, without sacrificing poise when you turn up the wick.   Both have taut suspension setups but KTM feels much more pliant than the Aprilia. In comparison, the Tuono’s suspension system, carried over unchanged from the RS 457, feels much stiffer, and you will feel more of the bumps. The brake-fade issue under repeated hard use on the 457s is another sore point, and while it isn’t a very difficult fix, Aprilia should’ve ironed it out by now. Especially since customers have shared that certain dealerships say warranties will be cancelled when brake master cylinders are upgraded.  EngineAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukeEngine457cc, twin-cyl, liquid-cooled399cc, single-cyl, liquid-cooledPower47.6hp at 9,400rpm46hp at 8,500rpmPower-to-weight ratio272hp/tonne273.33hp/tonneTorque43.5Nm at 6,400rpm39Nm at 6,400rpm KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 engine and performance Aprilia's engine is the star of the show, KTM is quick but not as characterful So far, it’s neck and neck, but one area where the Tuono scores a massive victory is the engine. The twin-cylinder mill is smooth, brimming with character, and makes all the right sounds. Its strong low-end and mid-range also mean you needn’t frantically work the gearbox, and it also pops nice power wheelies. In outright performance, the Tuono is quicker in the 0-100kph sprint by just 0.3 seconds, but its engine’s effortless grunt is more apparent in the roll-on acceleration tests.  The Tuono’s engine is a peach. Hopping onto the KTM after the Aprilia will make you realise you need to work the gearbox more and give the engine revs to make quick progress. You’ll also feel a more pronounced buzz, especially in the handlebar. However, the Duke’s refinement levels are respectable for a single-cylinder engine of this size with this level of performance. That said, the excitable hooligan nature of the KTM is great fun, if that’s the riding experience you’re after.  PerformanceAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukeAcceleration 0-60kph2.17s2.21s0-100kph4.88s5.21sRoll-on acceleration20-50kph1.73s1.87s30-70kph2.83s3.19s50-80kph2.68s3.22sBraking60-0kph (in metres)16.3516.52 KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 price and verdict Tuono is an impressive machine let down by pressing issues PriceAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukePrice (ex-showroom, Delhi)Rs 3.95 lakhRs 2.97 lakh All that back and forth now means I need to tell you which bike is the winner. The Tuono 457 feels very special to ride, but it’s nearly Rs 1.50 lakh more (on-road, Mumbai) with the accessory quickshifter installed. The engine and sublime handling are two very big factors to get one, and this motorcycle won’t be as common a sight on our roads as the Duke. There are buyers out there for whom the extra Rs 1.5 lakh will be justified because the Tuono feels like a scaled-down big bike, which is a very special feeling.  Brake-fade issue continues on Aprilia 457s. However, in the last couple of months, several customers have reported varied and significant engine reliability issues. Aprilia India recently attributed these issues to unauthorised modifications and/or irregular service and says that it has addressed the few genuine cases. Whether the issues are fully addressed is something only time can tell.  Beyond that, there is no escaping the fact that the 390 Duke has a much more accessible price, more features and better ride comfort, and it can be nearly as fast as the Tuono. There were some isolated engine incidents at the beginning, but Bajaj swiftly addressed them, and the bike has been around for long enough that there are no significant reliability concerns. All this is why the KTM 390 Duke will continue to reign in this segment. Also See: KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 comparison video",

    "description": "Don’t let the ‘Sport’ in its name mislead you; what makes this Range Rover quick is the little SV badge instead, though that also needs some clarification. You see, per JLR, SV cars in the JLR-verse are the ‘exquisite interpretations by Special Vehicle Operations’. So, while on the Range Rover, SV denotes ‘even more luxury’, on the Range Rover Sport, it signals ‘the fastest Range Rover of all time’. SV on the Range Rover Sport signals the fastest Range Rover of all time.  Indeed, powered by JLR’s BMW-sourced 4.4-litre twin-turbo petrol V8, tuned here to 635hp, this Range Rover Sport SV does the 0 to 100kph dash in a claimed 3.8 seconds and tops out at an impressive 290kph. So, while it’s got some off-road chops, it’s quite a different take from its regular off-roading siblings, and we got a day to experience it in the UK. Range Rover Sport SV Performance and Refinement: 8/10 The breadth of the powertrain’s character transformation is impressive Engage SV mode via the illuminated button positioned towards the base of the steering wheel, and the Sport SV preps the entire car, chassis, engine and all for a performance level beyond the regular Dynamic mode. Ride height drops by another 15mm, and torque bumps up 50Nm to 800Nm with the Dynamic launch mode. Range Rover Sport SV specsEngine Mild-hybrid, twin-turbo V8Displacement 4395ccPower635hpTorque 750Nm (800Nm with dynamic launch mode)Gearbox8-speed AT Drive layout All-wheel drive 0-100kph (claimed)3.8 seconds Top-speed (claimed) 290kph And boy, it is quick. I floor it in manual mode first and hit the redline in first and second gears before I can tug at the paddle. Cog swaps need to be supercar-style quick, and after telling my brain that, I get the full-bore launch – what a rush that is. Power delivery is thick and fast, and it revs freely past 7,000rpm; the acceleration feels nice and raw with sharp and quick gearshifts, quite uncharacteristically for a planetary torque converter autobox and quite a transformation from the unit’s daily driver abilities that it does just fine, too. Sport SV's straight-line speed and the engine’s flexible character are a delight.  What’s nice is there’s a neat soundtrack as well; perhaps some of the engine note is piped in through the speakers. But I’m not complaining; the gurgle from the exhausts is something we may soon not hear at all. Dynamic mode dials things down from wild to energetic. And left in Auto mode, the Sport SV is quite the relaxed town cruiser. Range Rover Sport SV Ride Comfort and Handling: 7/10 Can hold its own around corners but isn’t what you could call agile With all that propulsion, keeping a two-and-a-half-tonne SUV on the road is tricky business, so JLR has thrown a lot in terms of chassis systems. There’s all-wheel drive, all-wheel steering, torque vectoring by braking, an active rear locking differential and a setup that the company calls 6D Dynamics, a system that combines hydraulically linked dampers and height-adjustable air springs. Not light on its feet but hydraulically linked dampers help keep things sane around corners.  The semi-active 6D system does away with the need for anti-roll bars, and instead, the hydraulically linked dampers pump fluid between each other to keep roll and pitch in check. It does work to an extent; cornering around some twisty British B and C roads, the Sport SV feels composed, but it’s never agile or light on its feet like a Porsche Cayenne, for instance. Ride quality is firm, and you can easily feel every rut and crack from the road surface. Move out of SV mode, and things improve, but even at its most plush setting, there is a sharp edge to the ride. 23-inch carbon-fibre wheels look neat but lend a firm edge to ride quality. No doubt the 23-inch carbon fibre rims with the slim Michelin Pilot Sport All Season tyres do no favours. The steering weight is fine and changes with the drive mode, but it lacks an incisive feel to it. Braking performance is just fine, and the optional carbon-ceramic disc did a good job hauling this massive brute down from high speeds. Range Rover Sport SV Mileage: 6/10 The combined WLTP fuel efficiency rating for the Sport SV is 8kpl It might have mild hybrid tech, but with its weight and performance tuning, don’t expect the SV’s kilometre per litre figure to be in two digits. The official WLTP rating for the Range Rover Sport SV’s fuel efficiency is 8kpl. Range Rover Sport SV Exterior Design and Engineering: 8/10 The SV does not shout sport in your face but has enough presence to draw attention Range Rover Sport SV dimensionsLength 4970mm Width2209mm Height 1814mm Wheelbase 2998mm Kerb weight 2560kg Tyres (F, R)285/40 R23, 305/35 R23 Now in its third generation, the Sport moves to a new platform: JLR’s MLA-Flex, which gives it multiple powertrain options, including full electric due later. The exterior, though, features familiar styling cues as its predecessor; it’s just a bit sleeker and meaner – for instance, the grille, the headlights and the glasshouse area are slimmer, giving the car a sportier look. SV variant gets a healthy splash of carbon fibre trim all around.  The SV version, which is dialled up further, has broader air intakes at the bumper’s edges, reprofiled lower sides and functional quad-exit tailpipes. And, of course, there’s plenty of carbon fibre: from the aforementioned 23-inch rims to trim bits around the tailpipes, as well as for the front bumper slats, grille, and hood and side vents. There’s also the option of a carbon-fibre hood. Then there are vivid colours for the body and brake calipers, too, that you can also spec. All in all, to these eyes at least, the SV does the sport look just right, not too much but not too little either. Range Rover Sport SV Space and Comfort: 7/10 Spacious insides are more luxurious than outright sporty The insides look luxurious with a minimalistic styling theme, though it’s almost to the point of being quite bland, especially so for those who like things blinged-up. The dashboard is presented as a large, clean surface upon which a 13.1-inch touchscreen is placed. The central console, too, has its cubbies closed off and just a small stubby gear lever sticking out. Being the SV, there are some sporty bits like illuminated SV logos on the backrests and edge-illuminated paddle shifters, but on the whole, the interior does not scream sport. The cabin is classy, but some will find the minimalistic style bland. The SV also debuts JLR’s new ‘body and soul seats’ (BASS), which, as the acronym suggests, generate audio vibrations corresponding to the media played on the 29-speaker Meridian sound system. Available on the front seats only, there are also six different soundscapes – designed in collaboration with the National Transport Design Centre at Coventry University and the School of Media and Performing Arts – that combine sound and vibrations to relax or energise you. It’s hard to accurately describe the feeling, but it’s somewhere between a massage and a vibrating seat. Speaking of the seats, I found the lumbar a touch extra, but seating space both at the front and rear is ample enough. Range Rover Sport SV Features and Safety: 8/10 The Sport SV Edition Two trim comes well equipped The car we had in the UK was the ‘Edition Two’ spec, which meant it was well-equipped with bits like digital LED headlights, illuminated metal treadplates, 4-zone climate control, a 13.1-inch touchscreen, Meridian signature sound, 3D surround cameras, remote park assist, HUD, and heated ventilated and reclining seats at the front and rear. As for safety equipment, it has six airbags and a full ADAS suite, which works just fine on UK roads. Range Rover Sport SV Price and Verdict: 8/10 The Sport SV is certainly the most capable all-rounder in the JLR fleet Super SUVs of today are remarkable feats of engineering that have to deliver on diverse fronts: they have to be large and spacious like family SUVs, comfy like luxury sedans and quick like sports cars. So, they come at a price; in this one’s case, that’s Rs 2.95 crore ex-showroom, India. It’s a lot, but no more – in fact, exactly the same – as the Audi RS Q8 Performance, and in that aspect, it’s a fair ask. It’s the Sport SV’s breadth of talents that is truly impressive. It’s wanting in some places for sure. Like around corners, it’s not very agile, and ride quality, too, is not as pliant as some rivals. But while it cedes ground on dynamics, it gains in many areas. The interior, for example, is spacious and comfy, with a luxurious and classy feel. Outside, the styling is sleek and sporty, with a nice, elegant flair to it, and then, given its family lineage, the Range Rover Sport SV also has some off-roading chops baked into its DNA – 23-inch rims notwithstanding – and, in the end, that’s where its appeal lies. It’s the most capable all-rounder in the JLR portfolio and, against rivals, has a truly wide set of talents.

    "description": "Dear reader, I’m overjoyed to announce I’ve recently become a dad. Life has changed in so many ways (I’ve never valued a power nap as much as I do now!), and to an extent, so has the way I look at cars. I have become ever more mindful of the smallest of things that could make my little one’s car rides comfier. ISOFIX child seat anchors are a bit tough to find underneath the seat cushioning. Of course, step one was to get the child seat in order. The Hyundai Creta N Line I’ve been using gets ISOFIX child seat anchors to lock the seat firmly in place, but they’re tucked behind the cushioning and need a bit of poking around to locate. This is not a biggie for an average user who’d keep the seat in place for months at a stretch, but I have to keep removing and re-attaching the seat whenever there’s a new car I have to test. Thankfully, my daughter has taken well to the car seat and, as my wife reports from the back seat, enjoys her drives. Option to pre-cool the Creta using the phone app put to full use over the summer. We’ve had a baking summer in Mumbai, and my kiddo, understandably, hates being strapped onto her seat in a hot car. The solution has come in the form of remote pre-cooling. To be honest, I’d never used connected car features beyond a review evaluation, but today, setting up the car in advance with the tap of a few buttons on my phone screen is part of my SOP. The option to remotely start the vehicle and have the air conditioning run has been an absolute boon. Hyundai’s BlueLink app is easy to use, and I’ve not had challenges with the network, which is known to be an issue with many eSIM-based connected services. Our kiddo loves looking through the panoramic sunroof. Of course, we’ve had our share of crying spells on the go. Bumper-to-bumper traffic with an irate baby is not fun, I can tell you that. On one such drive, retracting the cover for the panoramic sunroof proved to be an Eureka moment. The newfound view of the world above immediately distracted my daughter, making the remainder of the journey a lot, well, calmer. Something tells me kids will love the Mahindra BE 6 and XEV 9e’s trippy, colour-changing roof lighting. The Creta N Line, in general, has proved to be good transport for the family, but I do wish there was more luggage room. I never realised a stroller occupied so much space! Fuel economy figure firmly in the single digits in chock-a-block city driving. More efficiency would be welcome, too. Fuel economy has been in the 7-8kpl range, but to be fair, my bumper-to-bumper slog never gives cars a chance to breathe free. Of the other things, there’s an irritating plasticky creak from the centre console every time a driver’s leg presses against it. This is something we experienced on our Creta IVT, too. Centre console lets out creaks whenever the driver’s leg rests on it. I have ambitious plans for a road trip over the monsoons. It’ll be a full house with my wife, baby, doggo and myself in the car. Time to dig deeper into the Creta’s box of tricks!

    "description": "Having revealed the introductory starting price of the Harrier EV earlier this month, Tata Motors has now announced the full price list, including the AWD variant. The Harrier EV RWD price ranges between Rs 21.49 lakh and Rs 27.49 lakh (ex-showroom, India), while the Harrier EV AWD is priced at Rs 28.99 lakh. Not only does the Harrier EV sit at the pinnacle of Tata’s all-electric line-up, but it’s also the carmaker’s first model with an all-wheel-drive layout since the Safari Storme was discontinued over five years ago. Bookings for the Harrier EV are slated to open on July 2, 2025. UPDATE: Tata Harrier EV scores 5-star BNCAP safety rating Tata Harrier EV 65 range revealed Tata Harrier EV launched in India at Rs 21.49 lakh (introductory) Electric SUV sports minor design tweaks over current Harrier  Gets 65kWh and 75kWh battery pack options; maximum output is 313hp and 504Nm Here's a look at the full price list of the Harrier EV: Tata Harrier EV priceAdventure 65 Rs 21.49 lakh Adventure S 65 Rs 21.99 lakh Fearless+ 65Rs 23.99 lakh Fearless+ 75Rs 24.99 lakh Empowered 75Rs 27.49 lakh Empowered 75 QWDRs 28.99 lakh Do note, an AC fast charger and its installation cost will be levied additionally.  Tata Harrier EV exterior design Mostly identical to ICE-powered Harrier On the outside, the Harrier EV’s styling largely echoes the facelifted Harrier that’s been on sale here since 2023. However, Tata has brought it in line with other EVs in its line-up. Up front, the Harrier EV gets a new closed-off grille, underneath which sits a revised bumper with a line-based design. Over to the side, the Harrier EV comes with a set of new 19-inch, aero-optimised alloy wheels and ‘EV’ badging on the front doors. The only change at the rear is the ‘Harrier.EV’ lettering on the tailgate. The Harrier EV is 2mm longer and 22mm taller than the standard Harrier, though their wheelbases are the same – 2,741mm. All-black Stealth Edition on offer Four colour options will be available with the Harrier EV at launch: Empowered Oxide, Nainital Nocturne, Pristine White, and Pure Grey. Alongside these, Tata will also sell a Stealth Edition of the Harrier EV, which features blacked-out design elements inside and out – in line with the carmaker's Dark Edition models. Tata Harrier EV interior and features Infotainment screen is a Samsung QLED panel Much like the outside, the Harrier EV’s cabin doesn’t stray far from its ICE-powered counterpart. However, the 14.53-inch infotainment screen that sits atop the dual-tone dashboard is a world-first Samsung Neo QLED display, which should make for crisper image quality. There's a 10.25-inch digital driver’s display and a four-spoke steering wheel with an illuminated Tata logo. Boot space stands at 502 litres (999 litres with second row folded down), and a frunk is available too. Harrier EV feature list is loaded The centre console has a touch-based HVAC control panel, and moving further down reveals a rotary selector for the six terrain modes - Normal, Snow/Grass, Mud-Ruts, Sand, Rock Crawl, Custom - and electronic parking brake. Other notable features on the Harrier EV include a panoramic sunroof, ambient lighting, ventilated and powered front seats, powered Boss mode for the second row, 10-speaker JBL sound system with Dolby Atmos 5.1, powered tailgate, vehicle-to-load (V2L) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) functionality, four drive modes (Eco, City, Sport, and Boost), all-digital inside rearview mirror, auto park assist, and more. With the Harrier EV, Tata has also debuted a new electrical architecture termed TiDAL (Tata Intelligent Digital Architecture Layer) that powers the SUV's connected car features, such as over-the-air (OTA) updates, voice commands, etc. Additionally, the Harrier EV gets a 540-degree surround camera view that alerts the driver if any of the wheels comes too close to a kerb, and there's a new DrivePay feature that eliminates the need for a mobile device for FASTag and EV charging point payments. Coming to safety, the Harrier EV comes equipped with six airbags as standard (seven in higher trims), a 360-degree camera, built-in dashcam, blind spot monitor, electronic stability control (ESC), and more. Level 2 ADAS is also part of the Harrier EV's safety suite, and Tata claims that it has been fine-tuned for Indian road conditions. Moreover, the system can provide a live feed stitched from all the cameras around the Harrier EV, which can be quite helpful while off-roading and is a segment-first addition. Tata Harrier EV battery and range Generates up to 504Nm of torque The Harrier EV leverages an enhanced iteration of Tata’s Acti.ev platform, which debuted last year with the Punch EV and is also utilised by the Curvv EV. Entry-level trims of the Harrier EV come equipped with a 65kWh LFP battery pack that powers a single motor on the rear axle that sends 238hp to the rear wheels. In higher trim levels, the Harrier EV gets a 75kWh LFP battery and dual motors – one for each axle – that develop a combined 313hp and a whopping 504Nm. This variant can sprint from 0-100kph in just 6.3 seconds with the Boost mode enabled. 75kWh Harrier EV delivers up to 627km range As far as range goes, the Harrier EV's RWD 75kWh and AWD 75kWh variants can travel up to an MIDC-certified 627km and 622km on a single charge. When subjected to Tata’s internal testing cycle – dubbed C75 – the RWD 75kWh version returned a real-world range of 480-505km, easily surpassing other EVs from the carmaker. When it comes to charging, a 7.2kW AC charger can replenish the Harrier EV from 10-100 percent in 10.7 hours, while a 120kW DC fast charger will juice up the SUV’s battery from 20-80 percent in 25 minutes. Notably, the Harrier EV incorporates a new 'Ultra Glide' multi-link suspension setup at the rear with frequency-dependent dampers for better off-road drivability. To that end, Tata has included an 'Off-road Assist' function - essentially a low-speed cruise control that can be set as low as 5kph -  and a 'Transparent' mode that projects an image of what's underneath the Harrier EV on the infotainment screen. There's a four-level regenerative braking system on offer with the Harrier EV too, as well as a summon mode that can extract the SUV from tight spaces autonomously. For more spirited drivers, Tata offers a Drift mode in the Harrier EV, which likely dials down the traction control. Tata Harrier EV price, variants and rivals Lifetime battery warranty Tata will sell the Harrier EV in three trims: Adventure, Fearless+, and Empowered. The 65kWh battery has been available on the Adventure and Fearless+ trims, while the larger 75kWh battery comes on the Fearless+ and Empowered trims; AWD is likely to be reserved for the top Empowered trim only. Tata has also confirmed that all Harrier EV buyers will get a lifetime warranty for the battery. Higher starting price than BE 6, but undercuts XEV 9e and Atto 3 At this price point, the Harrier EV lands squarely against the Mahindra’s latest EV duo – the XEV 9e and BE 6 – and the BYD Atto 3.

    "description": "On by one, most carmakers in India are revaluating their hybrid plans for our market and Honda Cars India is no different. The Japanese brand’s initial hybrid foray in India with the City e:HEV – powered by a 126hp, 1.5-litre strong hybrid engine and delivering 26.5kpl – was more a signalling exercise than a market-defining product. While the City hybrid showcased Honda’s global capabilities and offered a refined, fuel-efficient alternative in the midsize sedan space, its imported components and resultant pricing (Rs 20.85 lakh, ex-showroom, Delhi) limited its commercial success. Upcoming Honda hybrid cars for India to use new modular platform New Honda hybrid cars likely to be positioned in the Rs 15 lakh-30 lakh bracket Honda hybrid plans for India New Honda hybrid cars to be based on PF2 platform Having learnt from this experience, Honda is now recalibrating its hybrid strategy. At the core of this shift is the PF2 platform – a modular, hybrid-compatible architecture that will form the basis of Honda’s future product portfolio in India. Unlike the City e:HEV, upcoming models based on PF2 are expected to be significantly localised, improving cost viability and aligning better with Indian market dynamics. New Honda hybrid SUVs, crossovers and sedan likely Honda is likely to use the PF2 platform to launch a new range of SUVs and crossovers, including the all-new City, tailored to the Rs 15 lakh-30 lakh segment, where demand for hybrid technology is expected to rise alongside tightening CAFE norms. This also aligns with Honda’s global shift, as the company has reinforced its commitment to scale hybrid offerings across key markets as part of its broader electrification roadmap. With localised production, hybrid-ready architecture, and a clearer understanding of market expectations, Honda is aiming for a more grounded and scalable hybrid play in India, balancing performance, fuel economy, and affordability in a way its first attempt did not fully achieve. Honda joins the likes of Hyundai, Skoda-Volkswagen, and others in have a new hybrid strategy for our market.  With inputs from Hormazd Sorabjee Also see: Honda City Sport launched at Rs 14.89 lakh Hypermiling Honda City e:HEV: Bengaluru to Mumbai on a single tank of fuel Honda Civic Type R Ultimate Edition revealed as limited-run swansong",
