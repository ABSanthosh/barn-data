    "description": "This 1976 Ford Bronco was acquired by the current owner in 2014. Refurbishment and customization work performed over the following two years is detailed below on records totaling nearly $90k, and involved modifying the body, refinishing the exterior in metallic blue, powder-coating the family-style roll cage, and adding a custom-fitted tan soft top, a Smittybilt winch, power-deployable side steps, and aftermarket bumpers. The interior was reupholstered in tan leather and outfitted with a widened rear bench seat, color-coordinated trim, satin billet-style accents, new carpeting, a woodgrain steering wheel, a lockable center console, a replacement gauge cluster, a heater, and a custom sound system consisting of a Huntington retro-style stereo with SiriusXM capability, a subwoofer, and Focal speakers. The bored and stroked 331ci small-block Ford V8 features Holley HP electronic fuel injection (EFI) and a custom-fabricated exhaust system, and is linked to an automatic transmission and a Dana 20 dual-range transfer case. The truck rides on a lifted suspension with Bilstein dampers and Skyjacker front springs and 18\" polished aluminum wheels with 35\" BFGoodrich tires, and utilizes power-assisted steering, a Hydroboost unit, front disc brakes,  and manually locking front hubs. This Bronco is offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a New York title in the owner's name.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/smart-roadster-spice-summer-%C2%A31500-gem",
    "description": "The last 20 years have turned the Smart Roadster from annoying and expensive to quirky and cheap The pauses didn’t help, nor not knowing quite when they’d come. And there was more than one kind of pause to be experienced aboard a Smart Roadster.  The most obvious, and persistent, was the between-gears interruption generated by the automated manual transmission. The Roadster’s gearbox was not an especially speedy shuffler of clustered cogs and its six gears meant that, unless cruising, you’d experience perpetual ascents and descents of its generous ratio set. And if you left the ’box to think about its own shifting, you’d find that you were never quite ready for the moment when it chose to cut the power supply from the mid-mounted triple, even with familiarity. There were dynamic hesitations too. This was an exceptionally light, mid-engined sports car that ought to have changed direction like a dragonfly. Spear a bend, and in the first instant you’d think it was going to do just that, the front wheels eagerly steering a new trajectory. But then the Smart’s athleticism would start to evaporate. You couldn’t call it understeer, but if you were expecting Lotus Elise balletics, well, you’d have to buy the real thing. There was more, besides – the Roadster’s traction control dropping the curtain on any on-the-limit expeditions before they really started. It looked like a sports car, and an exciting one at that, but the Roadster’s cornerus interruptus methods protected its occupants from almost all kinds of on-the-road excitements. Still, after Mercedes’ adventures with toppling A-Classes and Smart Fortwos accelerating hard enough to land flat on their backs, you could understand the caution. In plenty of other ways, though, the Roadster was the result of some admirably brave decisions. The bold Smart project wobbled for more than stability reasons, the two-seat city car falling massively short of sales expectations following its (delayed) 1998 debut, but that didn’t stop the Roadster project going ahead. Indeed, this dinky little device promised to deal with Smart’s mild glamour deficit. It was also admirably true to the Fortwo’s construction concept. There was the so-called Tridion safety cell, this the pressed steel inner tub that provided a structure from which to hang the suspension, powertrain and a colourful collection of composite body panels. The engine was the same lively 698cc turbo triple that powered the Fortwo, its 80bhp impressive for one so small, and less burdened than it might have been with only 815kg to shove along. The Roadster benefited from Smart’s appealingly distinct cabin furnishing schemes too, chunks of its dashboard sheathed with non-reflective cloth. Much of it was grey, but there were multiple shades of the stuff and you could give the interior ambience a cheerfully spectacular lift by specifying orange cloth. And like the Fortwo’s, the Roadster’s instrument pods were so shapely that you wanted to pick them up. In fact, the entire car was so shapely that you wanted to pick one up and take it home. Especially if it was the oddly named Roadster Coupé version, with its pertly curving fastback rump. The standard Roadster, this sadly the more common version, had a flat rear deck and a conventional boot, and looked more pick-up than convertible because it had B-pillars and a targa roof, like the Coupé. This electric roll-back fabric slice instantly opened the cabin to the sky, and if you stirred yourself, you could get out, remove the side panels, lock them into their under-bonnet slots and generate a real, windows-down breeze. So with all this temptation, how to overcome those disappointing pauses? For the transmission, do your shifting manually. Then you’ll know when the pause is coming, just as you do in a car with a clutch. An optional sports wheel with paddles eases the process, and you can mitigate the jerks with some fancy (right) footwork.  The dulled steering? There’s less you can do about that, but you soon adapt, and you’ll certainly enjoy the Roadster’s low centre of gravity, unwillingness to roll and grippy grip. Which, up to a point, gets you around the ESP interference. Above all – and your reporter knows this, because his wife has one – this Smart is still great fun. It’s surprisingly brisk, comfortable, reasonably practical and not too noisy, the sounds emanating from behind in any case throbbily intriguing. Despite its flaws, the concept car-ish Roadster is sure to become a classic, especially as there aren’t huge numbers. Production ended after only three years and 43,400 units, sales undermined by the aforementioned issues, high pricing (for its size if not sophistication) and warranty costs that were alleged to reach €3000 per car. Water leaks were one reason. Right now, around £2000 nets you the cheapest decent Roadster, which isn’t much for the resulting entertainment. And at the top end, £6000 will get you a low-mileage, hard-riding 100bhp Brabus, or a mint 80bhp survivor, a price that confirms their creeping desirability.",

    "description": "Sean Skinner is the Jekyll and Hyde of custom motorcycles. Sometimes he builds tidy restomods that show restraint, and other times he builds idiosyncratic machines that put his imagination on full display. This sublime Yamaha RD350 street tracker sits somewhere in the middle. Sean runs MotoRelic as a one-man band, out of a small garage behind his house in Hamilton, Virginia, USA. This project was commissioned by a customer who had picked up a 1973 Yamaha RD350 for $350 (a proper barn find) and wanted it turned into a street tracker. “Normally, getting a bike for $1 per cc is a great deal,” says Sean. “But when he sent the photos, I felt like he overpaid. It was the crustiest, most forgotten bike I’d ever seen.”…",

Our suspicions were right. Philipp has been with BMW for years, working in both the automotive and motorcycle divisions, and is currently part of Motorrad’s R\u0026D team. This R 1300 R is his latest creation—built inside BMW’s prototype workshop, with help from a crew of in-house designers and engineers.

    "description": "SUVs big and small are all the rage, but there's another story developing on the sidelines – the rise of MPVs. MPVs outsold sedans in India last year and there's record interest in the body style high up the price ladder too. Kia's Rs 64 lakh (ex-showroom) Carnival is sold out for the year while Toyota delivered over 1,000 units of the Rs 1.22 crore Vellfire over the past 12 months. It’s customers like these who are happy to spend big on an MPV that MG wants to win over with its own luxury MPV. Meet the M9. MG hasn’t announced prices as yet but has hinted that the M9 will slot in right between the Kia Carnival and Toyota Vellfire. Giving the M9 more distinction is the fact that it’s the first all-electric luxury MPV in India. As you’d imagine, there’s lots to talk about.  MG M9 exterior design and engineering - 7/10 Being 5.27m long, 2m wide and 1.8m tall, the MG M9 is massive. For perspective, it’s longer and wider than the Carnival and Vellfire.The 3.2m long wheelbase is huge in its own right and hints at the space inside. At 5.27m, the M9 is longer than a Carnival and Vellfire.  In its basic shape, the M9 is boxy to allow max cabin space. It’s not a looker but then again, MPVs are all about what they are like on the inside, rather than visual appeal. The front end is home to slim DRLs up top, main headlights lower down on the bumper and a large grille at the base, with generous use of chrome to add some flash. This being an EV means the bonnet lifts to reveal storage - a handy 55 litre frunk in the M9’s case. 19-inch wheels and a stylistic chrome finish at the window line help uplift the slab-like sides. At the back, if the size doesn’t do it, the lighting that drops down at the side will sure help identify an M9.    Under the bonnet is a 55-litre frunk. The M9 uses a monocoque construction and positions its 90kWh NMC battery pack under the floor. The battery powers a front motor that drives the front wheels. The MG M9’s 19-inch rims come wrapped in Continental Contiseal tyres. What makes these tyres special is a viscous sealant layer that self-seals punctures up to 5mm.  19-inch rims come wrapped in self-healing tyres.   MG M9 interior space and comfort - 9/10 Access to the M9’s middle row is via powered sliding doors that can be opened via a button on the door, the key fob or controls near the driver. It’s a slight step up into the cabin but a large grab handle at the B-pillar does help the journey in. The doors open to a massive cabin and what gets you first are the middle row seats. XL-sized, beautifully cushioned and finished in perforated leather and suede, the seats – scratch that – armchairs immediately establish the M9’s core competency – delivering a VIP experience for the boss sat at the back. M9's middle-row seats are more like armchairs. The standard seat position is comfy in its own right and there’s 16-way power adjust too to control for everything from backrest recline and headrest height to seat slide and legrest position. One-touch functions make the job of setting the seat easier. For the full effect, you need to experience the seats at max extension (made possible with the middle row seat all the way back and front passenger seat electrically slid forward). Backrest at full recline and legrest rolled out, the seat feels no less than a recliner. Oh, and there’s seat ventilation and heating too, as well as eight soothing massage functions to choose from. The experience is every bit business class on land. In standard position, the middle-row seats are already very comfortable. While middle seat comfort is central to the M9’s appeal, the experience at the very back is pretty good too. You’ll have to make your way to the third row via the passage between the middle row chairs. It’s not quite a walk in but is convenient enough, as third rows go. The seating position is comfortable and there’s room for three average-sized adults to sit in comfort. Unusually, there’s no middle seat headrest or fold down armrest for the third row. Also note, the third row is all but unusable with the middle row seats fully extended. Stretching out the seats to their max gives a recliner-like experience. What’s noteworthy is that front seat occupants have it nice too. The seats are fully powered and also pack in heating, ventilation and massage functions. The driver environment does take some getting used. Partly because of the M9’s sheer size, and partly because of the layout of the controls - the gear selector sits on the right stalk behind the steering while the left stalk is for lights and wipers. Third row has space for three adults, but no middle seat headrest. The M9’s dash is neatly done but the flush finish to the climate control functions on the dash panel looks better than it is in practice.    MG M9 features and safety - 9/10 The M9 is offered in a single fully loaded variant. And MG has really gone the distance to pamper those sat at the back. As mentioned, the seats are fully powered with ventilation, heating and massage functions. There’s 64-colour ambient lighting, a dedicated climate control zone for the middle row, an onboard air purifier, a panoramic sunroof for the rear section of the cabin, a sweet-sounding 13-speaker JBL sound system and you can also get rear entertainment screens as an accessory. Middle-row passengers get a dedicated climate zone and panoramic sunroof. Seat adjustment, cooling and lighting functions are controlled by a screen on the middle seat armrests. Trouble is, the fixed position of the screen makes it hard to read in some lighting conditions and hard to reach when the backrest is all the way back. MG should have also given the M9 powered sun shades for the middle row windows. The manual operation isn’t in keeping with the M9’s price. On the subject, there are no sun shades for the third row windows and that means middle-seat passengers will feel the heat on their face at full recline. Armrest-mounted screen controls seat, cooling and lighting functions. Up front, you get powered, heated, ventilated and massage seats, dual-zone climate control and a single-pane sunroof. Taking pride of place on the dash is a 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless Android Auto/ Apple CarPlay, and eSIM-based connected tech. The 7-inch digital dials, in comparison, look small and basic. What is nicely done is the digital mirror. It relays a feed from a rear camera and gives a crisp view of the world behind. Touchscreen measures 12.3-inch size; supports wireless Android Audo/Apple Carplay. The MG M9 hasn’t been rated by Global NCAP or Bharat NCAP as yet but it’s reassuring to know that the big MPV is a 5 star Euro NCAP car. As standard, the M9 gets 7 airbags, ESC, all-around disc brakes, Isofix child seat mounts, a tyre pressure monitor and a 360-degree camera (the resolution is so-so). Camera and radar-based advanced driver assistance systems or ADAS are included too. Functions such as lane departure assist worked well on the smooth and well marked roads in Goa. Also part of the package is a driver attention system that monitors for drowsiness, distractions like mobile use and even smoking!   MG M9 performance and refinement - 8/10 Power delivery is strong and nicely measured out. The MG M9 has a front axle mounted motor that puts out 245hp and 350 Nm of torque. There’s also Normal, Eco and Sport drive modes, but that doesn’t transform this luxury cruiser into a rocket ship and that’s a very good thing. All too often, all manner of EVs dump their power in one go for wild acceleration, just because an EV can. Not in the M9, make no mistake though it’s not slow, a sub 10 second 0 to 100kph time is what should be possible and that’s quick enough, what’s nice however is that its power delivery is strong and nicely measured out, perfectly in sync with the vehicles character. Overtaking is thus easy, even in Eco mode, put your foot down and the M9 moves off smartly. Road, wind and suspension noise are very well contained on the M9.  Refinement is a highlight on the M9. You do hear a whirr from the electric motor at very slow speeds, but otherwise, the powertrain runs quiet. Road, wind and suspension noise are also well contained yielding a soothing atmosphere on the go. MG M9 range and efficiency - 7/10 The M9 has a 90kWh battery, and while an ARAI-certified range figure is awaited, MG claims a 548km range achieved over internal tests. Internationally, though, the MPV has a certified WLTP range of 430km. On our drive, the M9 indicated a range of around 300km, but that was with a lot of time spent idling with the AC on during the shoot. We’ll only know the actual range once we put the M9 through our instrumented tests in Mumbai. The M9 has a certified WLTP range of 430km. Given the unreliable charging infrastructure on our highways, the M9 isn’t ideal for long cross country trips. Delivering supreme comfort over intra city commutes is the M9’s forte.  MG M9 ride comfort and handling - 7/10 Where MG could have done more to pamper the M9’s crorepati clientele is in ride comfort. There’s a stiffness to the setup which means body movements are well contained at higher speeds. However, the suspension and tyres can’t iron out smaller imperfections at lower speeds as successfully. The low-speed ride feels a bit busy for what is a luxury car.   It handles surprisingly well for its size and mass.  The MG M9 manages its bulk around corners fairly well, driven sensibly or even slightly quickly, body roll is well contained, no doubt helped by the battery mass down below. The steering and brakes also have two drive settings – Normal and Sport, the latter of which firms up the steering and was generally nice to use. The Sport mode on the brakes though wasn’t to my liking given that at lower speeds it comes off as grabby. Speaking of brakes there’s adjustable regen modes with three levels on offer, L1 offers up a deceleration akin to a conventional ICE vehicle while L2 and L3 offer up stronger retardation, there is however no single pedal driving. MG M9 price and verdict - 8/10 The MG M9 is easy to drive for something so large but lets be honest, it’s not intended for the self drive owner. It’s for chauffeur-driven buyers. And it’s this target clientele that will have much to like about the M9. Middle row space and seat comfort are fantastic, refinement is really impressive and MG has also packed in a whole lot of goodies. Ride comfort could have been better but it’s not a deal breaker.  The M9 delivers on the brief of a luxury MPV quite appropriately.  The promise, then, is for Vellfire-like comfort for a whole lot less money (we estimate a price of Rs 90 lakh ex-showroom). To help convince buyers to see the M9 as a vehicle worthy of the big bucks, MG will retail the MPV from its new, premium MG Select dealerships. The M9 might not be the first luxury vehicle that comes to mind for anyone shopping at this price bracket, but it sure deserves a look. It might just surprise you.  Also see: MG M9 interior, seating and comfort review 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed review: Luxury SUV embraces its sporty side",

    "description": "The new Vida VX2 is the all-important family scooter that joins the existing V2 in the company’s electric line up. It packs a more widely-acceptable look, fewer features and a unique pricing strategy with BaaS as an option, but crucially, the fundamentals are largely the same as the V2. Hero Vida VX2 design and quality - 8/10 A clean, appealing design in a choice of seven colours What makes the Vida VX2 stand out from its sibling is its new design and I think Hero has created a rather likeable looking thing. The signature Vida headlamp along with the upper cowl that houses the indicators gives it a sense of identity but without becoming polarising like the Vida V2. The side and rear panels are more conventional, yet cleanly designed and it culminates in a rear section which is unlikely to create any strong opinions, either positive or negative. The VX2 has a clean design and quality has seen a step up as well. The VX2 is based on an updated version of the same chassis as the V2, with some changes made towards weight reduction. It packs fewer body panels, which further assists with reducing the weight to 115kg; around a 9 kilo weight saving over the equivalent V2 Plus.  Weight and dimensionsWeight and dimensionsKerb weight115kgSeat height777mmWheelbase1301mmBoot space 27.2 litres (Plus) / 33 litres (Go)Front storage space5 litres Another advantage of fewer body panels is that Hero has improved the overall finish quality with fewer uneven panel gaps or unsightly rough plastics. There’s new switchgear which looks and feels better than before and the VX2 has the best finish we’ve seen on a Hero scooter to date - hopefully a trend that will continue. There is still ground for improvement, particularly in areas like the fiddly lock for the removable batteries, but overall finish levels are no longer an area of concern. Hero Vida VX2 range and charging - 8//10 Unique removable batteries with multiple charging options Being based on the same platform as the V2, the Vida VX2 also gets the same removable batteries - two (3.4kWh total) in the Plus variant seen here and one (2.2kWh) in the base Vida VX2 Go variant. These batteries can be charged directly inside the scooter or they can be removed and charged indoors. The VX2 can also be charged at the Ather Grid fast charging network of which there are now over 4000 chargers across the country.  The Plus variant has 2 removable batteries, while the Go has only one. Battery and rangeVida VX2Battery capacity3.4kWhClaimed IDC range 142kmClaimed real world range Eco Mode100kmClaimed real world range Ride Mode75kmClaimed real world range Sports Mode60kmCharger wattage580WCharge time (0-100%)5hr39min The scooter is bundled with a 580 watt charger with a 5A three-pin plug that means you don’t need a 15A outlet. Hero claims charging times comparable to a 650 watt charger (0-100%in 5hr 39min) thanks to their charger being able to provide a more steady output.  Even with two removable batteries under the seat, the company has managed to liberate 27.2-litres of storage space. My helmet could just about fit in but it was slightly too tall for the seat to fully close. A smaller full-face or an open face helmet should easily fit. Going for the VX2 Go with its single battery increases boot space to 33 litres. The Plus has a slightly smaller boot than the Go. IDC range for the Plus is 142km, but Hero claims a real world range of 100km in Eco mode. Switching to Ride or Sport modes reduce that to a claimed 75km and 65km respectively.  Hero Vida VX2 motor and performance - 8/10 Uses the same motor and specs as the Vida V2 The VX2 runs a swingarm mounted PMSM electric motor that produces the same 6kW peak and 3.9kW continuous power as the Vida V2 and it has the same 25Nm of torque. Top speed is capped at an indicated 80kph for the VX2 Plus (70kph for the Go). Ride mode restricts the speed to 70kph and Eco to just 45kph, which is too low for life in the city. It is not very sporty in the way it accelerates, but the overall performance is more than enough for a city runabout. However, there’s a neat work around in the form of Boost mode, which effectively unlocks the full performance regardless of which mode you are in when you twist the accelerator wide open. This was a valuable feature, although you can deactivate it in case you are trying to maximise range. SpecificationsSpecificationsSuspension(F/R)Telescopic fork / MonoshockBrakes (F/R)190mm disc / 130mm drumTyres (F/R)90/90-12 / 100/80-12MotorPMSM, swingarm-mountedPower6kWTorque25NmGearboxSingle-speed The VX2 is not very sporty in the way it accelerates, but the overall performance is more than enough for a city runabout. Where it impresses is in just how polished and refined the riding experience is with perfectly judged accelerator response and almost no regen braking on a closed throttle, which makes for a delightfully smooth riding experience.  Hero says the advantage of its setup is that punctures can be easily repaired by a roadside mechanic. You can reverse twist the accelerator for regen braking, but it isn’t very strong even when you do this and it would have been nice to have adjustable regen. As for sound, there is a clearly audible electric whine and while it's not as loud as an Ather, it's also not as silent as the TVS iQube’s hub motor either.  However, Hero says that the advantage of their set-up is that punctures can be easily repaired by any road side mechanic.  Hero Vida VX2 comfort and handling - 8/10 Comfortable and more than capable enough The VX2’s smooth and easy going performance is paired with a chassis that has just the same qualities. The good impressions begin with how you sit on it thanks to a wide, spacious and comfy seat. Short riders will appreciate the low 777mm seat height but even tall folks will find a decent amount of comfort without too much of an issue of the handlebar fowling with the knees.                                         Even taller riders will comfortably fit on the VX2.  Suspension comfort seems to be nicely balanced and the scooter does a decent job of absorbing bumps and potholes. With 12-inch wheels at both ends, there’s a good amount of stability and the scooter feels well-controlled when taking turns. This applies to both low speed tight u-turns (the turning radius is tight) as well as leaning the scooter over in corners at a higher pace.  The display works well for the most part but could stand to be brighter. The Vida VX2 Plus gets a 190mm front disc and braking performance is perfectly judged for a scooter of this type - powerful enough, but not aggressive. From an overall dynamics perspective, this is not a sharp and sporty scooter, but it is very well behaved, more than capable enough and pleasant to ride. Hero Vida VX2 features and BaaS - 9/10 It’s well equipped, and BaaS pricing is a USP The feature that you will interact with most often is the 4.3-inch TFT display, which is simpler than the 7-inch touchscreen on the V2, but still gets the job done well. The layout and graphics are quite neat and it's reasonably straightforward to control this screen using the switchgear although you need to be quite precise with the 5-way joystick. Some people might want a higher max-brightness setting and the animations between menus could be a touch quicker, but neither is a serious concern. There’s also a reverse mode and a number of connectivity features that can be accessed via the mobile app.  The switchgear and 5-way joystick feel tactile. Hero’s USP is its unique BaaS pricing which massively reduces the buy-in cost. Under the BaaS scheme and with the PM E-Drive subsidy and an introductory offer in place, the VX2 Go costs just Rs 44,990 while the Plus is at Rs 54,990. The reason they are so affordable is because Hero is essentially financing the batteries separately. The company offers various schemes from a duration of 2-5 years and the costs are based on a minimum monthly running that differs with each plan. Once the loan period is over, the scooter is completely yours, including the battery. Hero Vida VX2 price and verdict - 8/10 Practical and sorted family EV at a tempting price When you work out the math, the BaaS scheme will end up being a little more expensive than buying outright - which you can also do at introductory prices of Rs 84,990 and Rs 99,990  for the Go and Plus respectively. It's easy to look at this as just a loan on the batteries, but it also comes with benefits like an extended 5 year warranty/50,000km on the battery, a three year assured buyback and free public fast charging for the duration of the selected BaaS scheme.  Overall, the BaaS scheme will end up being a little more expensive than buying it outright. Effectively, Hero is making it easier for customers to make the initial purchase with a lower downpayment and the company says that this is the big hurdle in the entry level two wheeler market. While the BaaS scheme is eye-catching, it is not the main reason behind the Vida VX2’s appeal. Even without it, this is a good looking, practical, and nice-to-ride family EV at a tempting price. The VX2 is something you should seriously consider if you have a similarly priced Ather Rizta, Bajaj Chetak or TVS iQube on your mind.  Also See: Hero Vida VX2 video review",

    "description": "Ather Energy has announced that it will be showcasing its new scooter platform – EL – and a bunch of other fresh developments at its annual Community Day 2025 to be held on August 30. New Ather EL platform to debut on August 30 Company working on new fast chargers  Recently, Ather Rizta crossed the 1 lakh unit sales milestone Ather EL scooter platform, new fast chargers being readied Ather Stack 7.0 operating software to also debut at this event. At its Community Day 2025, Ather will be showcasing its new scooter platform – EL – and concept vehicles, some of which are likely to be based on this new platform. Ather claims its new EL platform is engineered to be versatile and cost-efficient and will enable the company to expand its product line-up to cater to a wider range of customers. Currently, Ather is the sole mainstream player in the electric two-wheeler industry to not have an offering under the Rs 1 lakh mark. Competitors such as Bajaj, TVS, Ola Electric, Vida (Hero) and Greaves all have at least one product under that threshold and this new EL platform could remedy this for Ather. Ather is also working on its next-generation of Grid fast chargers, which it claims will make charging quicker and more convenient. For reference, the current Ather Grid chargers can top up any Ather e-scooter at the rate of 1.5km/min and any Vida e-scooter at 1.2km/min; since Vida uses Ather’s open-sourced charger connector, its products benefit from this system. Last but not least, Ather will also debut an upgraded version of its software stack, Ather Stack 7.0, which is likely to bring in more features to its products. At its previous Community Day, Ather launched its first family centric offering, the Rizta, which recently surpassed the one lakh unit sales milestone.
